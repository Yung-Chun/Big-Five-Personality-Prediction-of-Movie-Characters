S: EXT. RODEO STADIUM - DALLAS - TEXAS - DAY
N: Ambient sounds of the CROWD, RODEO, SEX, and a strange RINGING fade in along with IMAGES of... A COWBOY riding a BULL in an enclosed RODEO ring. RON WOODROOF, early 40's, handsome, long sandy hair, denim clad, worn snakeskin boots, dusty, cowboy hat, mirrored aviators, is engaged in wild SEX with a WOMAN. He watches the rodeo through open slats in a BULL STALL as the STEER throws the COWBOY violently thru the air; he lands hard on the dirt. Another WOMAN snorts cocaine and offers some to Ron as he switches over to having SEX with her. The BULL STOMPS the Cowboy with its HOOFS. Ron climaxes -- pleasure and pain seem to come out of him, but we can't hear him, only this strange RINGING. RODEO CLOWNS grab the Cowboy's limp body and drag him out of the ring. Ron catches his breath; something is off.
C: RON
D: Did ya hear Rock Hudson was a cock sucker?
E: V.O.
S: EXT. RODEO STADIUM - LOCKER ROOM - DAY
N: A Dallas NEWSPAPER folded in half. July. 1985. AIDS. New treatment. In Paris. ROCK HUDSON on the cover. A HAND scribbles numbers over the photo.
S: CLINT (V.O.)
N: Where'd ya hear that? CLINT (32) a greasy hick who's spent the last five months under the hood of a CHEVY, hands RON a WAD of CASH.
C: RON
D: It's called a newspaper. You heard of it?
N: Ron smiles, adjusts his cowboy hat as he records some bets. Nearby, BULL FIGHTERS are putting on their clown makeup.
C: RON
D: What a waste. All that fine Hollywood pussy on a guy who smokes his friends.
N: A HAND comes down through the slats holding a ten dollar bill. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 2
C: RON
D: C'mon Rog, this ain't the sandbox. Twenty's the minimum.
N: ROG slides another ten down; Ron snatches it.
C: ROG
D: Who the hell's Rock Hudson?
N: Ron looks at Rog. A beat, then he starts laughing, then coughing...
S: EXT. RODEO STADIUM - BULL STALL - DAY
N: ...and coughing as we follow him into the stalls. Ron glad- hands as he goes; it seems everyone knows him but doesn't necessarily like him. He makes his way toward T.J., white trash, pale as winter, who wipes vomit from his chin. As he nervously looks down at the big angry BULL he's about to ride, Ron hands him a pint of tequila.
C: RON
D: Calm the nerves, brother. You look great.
N: T.J. takes a swig, gives him a look.
C: RON
D: It's your day, I can feel it.
N: T.J. watches as Ron takes a bottle of NYQUIL out of his pocket and downs it... to stop his hacking cough.
C: T.J.
D: I don't know, Ron.
N: Ron fans the money out for T.J. to see.
C: RON
D: Eight seconds and you'll be gettin blown by a hundred dollar hooker before you can scrape the bullshit off your boots.
N: Ron winks and smiles. T.J. signals the BULLMAN that he's ready. And in five, four, three, two, one... THE GATE is up, the BULL is out, the crowd is HOLLERING and T.J.'s back is bending in unnatural ways.
C: RON
D: C'mon! One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand... Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 3
N: And T.J. is DOWN.
C: RON
D: Ah hen shit!
N: Ron looks to the BLEACHERS. The GAMBLERS are already searching for him. Ron slips out a SIDE ENTRANCE.
S: EXT. RODEO STADIUM - PARKING LOT - DAY
N: Sweating, heart racing, Ron runs across the lot and jumps over fences to escape THE GAMBLERS that are running after him. As they close in, Ron spots a cop, TUCKER, walking towards his patrol car.
C: RON
D: Hey, buddy I need you to arrest me.
C: TUCKER
D: Fuck off, Woodroof.
C: RON
D: Come on, man. I'm serious!
N: Tuck sees the angry mob approaching.
C: TUCKER
D: Looks like you got a few pissed off customers.
C: RON
D: You gonna cuff me or what?
C: TUCKER
D: Figure it out yourself.
N: And with that, Ron PUNCHES Tucker in the face. The mob of Gamblers are stopped in their tracks.
C: TUCKER
D: You son of a bitch!
N: Tucker PUNCHES Ron in the face twice, then cuffs him. He looks at the mob of Gamblers.
C: TUCKER
D: Get the fuck outta here before I arrest all of you.
N: Ron smiles through a bloodied mouth. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 4
S: EXT. RON'S TRAILER - DAY
N: Tucker's police car pulls up.
C: TUCKER
D: They're gonna kick the shit out of you one day, Woodroof. Maybe worse.
E: V.O.
S: INT. TUCKER'S POLICE CAR - DAY
N: Both Ron and Tucker are bleeding and bruised.
C: RON
D: Gotta die from somethin'.
C: TUCKER
D: Handle your business, huh? Get your shit together.
C: RON
D: You're startin' to sound like your ol' man. How's he doin' by the way?
C: TUCKER
D: There's good days and bad.
E: beat
C: RON
D: Ah, he's a tough one. Though I can't imagine how disappointed he must be havin' you for a son.
E: waving him off beat
N: Tucker looks at him, half-smiles.
C: TUCKER
D: Get the fuck outta my car.
N: Ron smiles, starts to get out, then stops. Holds his head a moment. We hear the strange RINGING sound again.
C: TUCKER
D: You okay?
E: CONT'D
C: RON
D: You rattled my fuckin' brain.
E: covers
C: TUCKER
D: What brain? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 5
N: Ron forces a smile, then exits the car. Tucker watches as Ron slowly heads toward his trailer; something seems off. After a few beats, Tucker brushes it off and pulls away.
S: INT. RON'S TRAILER - DAY
N: Books, newspapers, empty beer cans and liquor bottles; on the wall, we may notice a painting of some Texas Wildflowers. Ron stumbles in as the RINGING sound comes back. He stops, steadies himself on a piece of furniture, takes a few steps then collapses, unconscious.
S: INT. RON'S TRAILER - MORNING
N: The first shafts of sunlight fall over Ron, still asleep where he dropped. After a few beats, he stirs, pulls himself on to a chair. "What the fuck?".
S: EXT. OIL FIELD - DAY
N: Lunch time. Already a little drunk, Ron finishes off a pint of whiskey as Clint and a battered T.J. eat sandwiches nearby. Ron starts coughing again as he grabs a packet of cocaine out of his shirt pocket. He slides it across the table to Clint who hands him cash.
C: RON
D: That shit is purer than a preacher daughter's pussy.
C: CLINT
D: Not after you just coughed your lungs all over it.
C: T.J.
D: You think anymore 'bout Saudi Arabia? They need guys over there.
C: RON
D: What do you wanna go work for a buncha sand niggas for?
C: T.J.
D: They pay five times as much, that's why.
N: Ron raises his eyebrows, not bad.
C: T.J.
D: I'm signing up. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 6
C: RON
D: They got hot ladies over there?
C: T.J.
D: It's a Muslim country. You can't fuck the women.
C: RON
D: Now that takes me out right there.
N: The FOREMAN races over to them.
C: FOREMAN
D: Woodroof, there's been an accident on platform five. They need an electrician right away!
S: EXT. DRILL PLATFORM - DAY - LATER
N: A MEXICAN WORKER has his leg caught in the drill. It's severed and he's losing blood fast. Ron walks over.
C: RON
D: Dumb spic. How'd you get your leg in there?
N: The guy's breath is coming in short fast spurts.
C: RON
D: Where's the ambulance?
C: FOREMAN
D: He's illegal.
N: Ron takes his OWN shirt off, rips it in half, kneels down next to the MEXICAN, wipes some sweat off his brow and ties a makeshift tourniquet around his leg. Ron looks to the Foremen.
C: RON
D: Go call `em. Go FUCKING call `em.
E: the FOREMEN doesn't move
N: He walks off to call. Ron turns back to the Mexican.
C: RON
D: Alright we're going to get you outta there but you gotta stay still until I say get the fuck out and then you get the fuck out. Comprende? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 7
N: The guy nods. Ron walks over to the electrician's box. He's a little DRUNK. He grabs a wire and is about to cut it.
C: RON
D: Alright, on the count of three. One, two...
E: CONT'D
N: Ron cuts the wire, an electrical spark shoots out and before he can move back the box blows up in his face. Everything goes black.
C: RICK FERRIS
D: Azidothymidine, or AZT -- was originally developed as a treatment for cancer.
E: V.O.
S: INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
N: Barrow Wilkem rep RICK FERRIS, slick, well-dressed, gold Rolex, 40s, stands before DR. NATHAN SEVARD, 50's, arrogant, DR. EVE SAKS, early 30s, sophisticated, and five other PHYSICIANS, 40s-60s, all members of the hospital board.
C: RICK FERRIS
D: With the onset of HIV, however, we at Barrow Wilkem began a trial in which we administered AZT to infected lab animals. Initial findings suggested increased CD4 counts, restored T-cell immunity and also evidence of inducing weight gain.
C: SEVARD
D: Isn't it also true that it had some concerning side effects in animal tests, significantly decreasing the animals red and white blood cells?
C: RICK FERRIS
D: Yes, but its effect on the virus is better than anything else that's been tested.
C: EVE
D: In 64, when AZT was developed for cancer treatment, it was shelved due to lack of anti cancer efficacy and toxicity. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 8
E: looking into her file
C: RICK FERRIS
D: We believe those problems were dosage based.
C: EVE
D: So you're conducting another animal study?
C: RICK FERRIS
D: Actually the FDA has given us permission to go straight to human trials which is what brings me here today. We're conducting a double-blind, placebo- controlled randomized trial throughout the United States. Dallas Mercy is one of the proposed sites.
C: EVE
D: How long do you see the study going on?
C: RICK FERRIS
D: We're hoping to fast track it within a year? During which time the hospital and its administering physicians will be very well compensated for their efforts.
N: Eve notices as Sevard trades looks with Board Member #1.
C: RICK FERRIS
D: Sadly, the AIDS crisis will only get worse before it gets better. And I know I speak for everyone at Barrow Wilkem when I say getting this drug to market is our number one priority. This is a unique opportunity. A chance to be on the forefront in finding a cure.
N: Eve looks at Ferris and smiles.
S: INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY
N: Dr. Sevard walks down the hallway with Eve.
C: EVE
D: Does it not drive you just a little bit crazy when these guys stand up there talking about curing the sick while they're flashing gold Rolexes? What do they know about sick patients?
C: DR. SEVARD
D: They're pharma reps, not doctors. And like it or not, this is a business. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 8A
C: DR. SEVARD
D: How the hell did they get permission to go to human trials?
C: DR. SEVARD
D: People are desperate. People are dying. There is nothing else out there.
N: And with that, a NURSE approaches them with a file, surgical mask and latex gloves. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 9
S: INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - ROOM - DAY
N: Ron, head and eyes bandaged, lays on a bed. After a few beats, he peels off the eye bandages, gets up. He opens a cabinet, then a drawer. Finds a bag of sucking CANDY, pops a piece in his mouth, puts some in his pocket. He sees his jacket on the back of the door, searches his pockets for a cigarette. He's about to light one when Dr. Sevard enters with Eve Sakes. Both wear surgical masks and latex gloves.
C: DR. SEVARD
D: Mr. Woodroof. I'm Dr. Sevard.
N: Ron turns to Eve, flashes a smile.
C: DR. SEVARD
D: We saw something that concerned us in your initial blood work so we ran some additional tests.
C: EVE
D: Blood tests.
N: Ron stops moving and tries to assess the situation. Is he in trouble?
C: RON
D: What kinda blood tests, cause I don't use drugs.
C: EVE
D: We didn't test you for drugs.
C: RON
D: Good, cause that ain't none of yer business anyway.
C: DR. SEVARD
D: You've tested positive for HIV --
N: Ron looks at Dr. Sevard blankly.
C: DR. SEVARD
D: ...the virus that causes AIDS.
N: Ron freezes. A long beat.
C: RON
D: Who you kidding, Rock cock sucking Hudson bullshit?!
C: DR. SEVARD
D: Have you ever used intravenous drugs or had any homosexual -- Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 10
N: Ron spits out his CANDY.
C: RON
D: Homo? Homo? That's what you said, right? Shit. You gotta be kidding me. I ain't no faggot, I don't even know any faggots, I'm a rodeo!
E: laughs
N: The room is silent.
C: RON
D: Look at me, doc. Come on now, look at me. What do you see?
C: DR. SEVARD
D: Your T-cell count is down to nine, a healthy person has five hundred to fifteen hundred.
C: RON
D: What the fuck's a three-Cell?!
C: DR. SEVARD
D: T-cell. Frankly we're surprised you're alive.
C: RON
D: Well surprise this: you've made a fuckin' mistake!
N: Ron looks back and forth from Dr. Saks to Sevard. No mistake.
C: RON
D: You must've mixed my blood with some daisy puller or sumptin.
C: EVE
D: We ran the blood test several times.
N: Eve hands him some pamphlets and other paper work.
C: EVE
D: That's some information on HIV and AIDS you may find informative and your test results.
N: Ron flips through the papers. Becomes frustrated by terminology he doesn't understand.
C: DR. SEVARD
D: Mr. Woodroof, we're trying to impress upon you the gravity of your situation. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 11
E: MORE
C: DR. SEVARD
D: Based on your condition, we estimate that you have about thirty days to get your affairs in order --
E: CONT'D
C: RON
D: Thirty days?
N: Ron jumps off the examining table.
C: RON
D: What is this shit?!
N: They don't respond. Ron laughs incredulously and walks towards the door.
C: RON
D: I got a news flash for all y'all, there ain't nothin' out there that can kill Ron Woodroof in thirty days.
N: Ron looks at the papers, tosses them up in the air and exits.
S: INT. RON'S TRAILER - NIGHT
N: Music BLARES as Ron and T.J. party with two hot girls, KELLY and CRYSTAL, 20s. T.J. cuts a line of coke on a mirror while Ron dances over to the girls with SHOTS of Jack Daniels. They both start kissing, then rubbing up against Ron.
S: INT. RON'S TRAILER - NIGHT
N: T.J. is having sex with Kelly as Ron kisses Crystal; he leans down, snorts what is probably his fiftieth line of coke. He shakes it off, slams some Jack Daniels from the bottle as if it was Kool Aid. He's obliterated. As Ron stares off at something, T.J. waves at Crystal to join him and Kelly; as she does, we see what Ron is staring at -- a CALENDAR. But its days have no numbers. Except one, in blood RED -- 30. Ron snaps out of his hallucination.
S: INT. RON'S TRAILER - NIGHT
N: T.J. sits down next to Ron, takes a rolled up dollar bill and does a line of coke.
C: T.J.
D: Damn doctors cut your balls off? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 12
C: RON
D: Shit, you tell `em you got a cold and they'll give you two weeks off. You should try it.
N: Ron takes the dollar back as T.J. walks to the table to pour himself a drink.
C: T.J.
D: Well, you didn't miss nothin' at work. I'd take disability any day.
N: Ron does a line of coke. Sees his reflection in the mirror. Pushes it away.
C: RON
D: I mean I got a stupid cough and they tell me I got some HIV virus.
N: T.J. looks at Ron, hears him but doesn't hear him, maybe it doesn't even register he's so wasted.
C: RON
D: Hell, like I got the AIDS. Damn hospital, mixed up my blood samples.
E: mutters
C: T.J.
D: Man, I went to them doctors once, they tell me I had chlamydia, I came back home I realized I had crabs.
C: RON
D: S'what I'm saying.
N: T.J. licks some coke off his fingers.
C: T.J.
D: I heard you get that just by touchin' someone. Or that queers get it.
C: RON
D: Which is exactly why it's a mistake.
C: T.J.
D: Well, what if it ain't?
C: RON
D: You know me, T. You fuckin' serious?
C: T.J.
D: Damn right I know you, like you was born with some kinda pussy addiction. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 13
N: Ron smiles at the compliment as T.J. dives into the mirror and inhales the last line of coke. One of the GIRLS walks over.
C: KELLY
D: You said we would be dancin' by nine.
N: T.J. smiles at Ron.
C: T.J.
D: We should get goin'.
N: T.J. puts on his jacket.
C: T.J.
D: Let's go girls.
C: RON
D: I'll catch up with you.
C: T.J.
D: Alright brother, you cool?
C: RON
D: I'm cool.
C: T.J.
D: See you there.
N: T.J. and the girls leave. Ron gets up, wasted, and stares out the screen door into the cold dark night, nothing stares back at him.
S: INT. DALLAS PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY
N: Ron is seated in front of a screen that shows a microfiche of information on AIDS, HIV and AZT. LATER - DAY: Ron continues reading; the LIBRARIAN looks over as he endures a brief coughing spasm, then he goes back to his work. We PUSH IN on the phrase"...Unprotected sex..." LATER - DAY: Ron continues reading, runs his finger along the words. Stops at "INTRAVENOUS DRUG USE". As he closes his eyes and exhales--
S: EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT - DREAM / FLASHBACK
N: We're on a SNAKE TATOO on the back of a naked girl having wild sex with a younger and heavier Ron, totally wasted, and... Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 14 hypnotized by the tattoo that goes up to her neck and down to her arm -- marked with track marks.
S: INT. DALLAS PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY
N: Ron slams the book shut with rage. He screams out releasing his anger. His voice echoes off the library walls.
S: INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - RECEPTION AREA - DAY
N: Ron impatiently stands at the Triage desk, looking at a NURSE, 40s. He spots a tattooed Hispanic ORDERLY mopping the floor in the hallway. He locks eyes with Ron for a second too long then moves on.
C: NURSE FRAZIN
D: Dr. Sevard's not on today.
C: RON
D: Do I look like I can wait til tomorrow?
C: NURSE FRAZIN
D: If you'll tell me what the problem is --
C: RON
D: Problem? Which problem you want to hear about? My lungs bleeding, my skin crawling, the jackhammer in my head... hell that's just the beginning of my problems sweetheart.
N: Having overheard Ron's rant, Dr. Eve Saks walks over.
C: EVE
D: Mr. Woodroof?
N: Ron turns around.
C: RON
D: I don't want no nurse. I want a doctor. A goddamn doctor! Today! NOW!
N: The Orderly watches Ron and Eve.
C: EVE
D: Fine. How can I help you?
C: RON
D: Are you fuckin' deaf, lady? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 15
C: EVE
D: No. I'm a fucking doctor!
N: Oh? Ron contemplates Eve, slowly breaking into a smile. Eve hears her name called over the speaker system.
C: EVE
D: If you want to discuss your list of problems, you can meet me in my office in twenty minutes.
C: RON
D: Twenty minutes? I like your style, Doctor.
E: he takes a long look at her
N: Ron watches her as she walks away.
S: INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - DR. EVE SAKS' OFFICE - DAY
N: Diplomas hang in neat rows. A perfectly ordered desk. Eve meticulously records numbers on a chart.
C: RON
D: Can you get me AZT?
E: O.S.
N: Eve looks up as Ron walks in and sits down.
C: RON
D: Barrow Wilkem just released it for testing, right? This hospital is one of the sites.
N: She nods yes, surprised how well informed he is.
C: RON
D: Well can I buy some?
C: EVE
D: That isn't how it works. For about a year, a group of patients will either get the drug or a placebo, it's left up to chance, not even the doctors are allowed to know.
C: RON
D: You give dyin' people sugar pills?
C: EVE
D: It's the only way to know if a drug works. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 16
C: RON
D: Can you get it for me?
C: EVE
D: Unfortunately no. But when it's proven to work and if you fit the profile, then yes.
C: RON
D: So, you're tellin' me I'm as good as a horse being sold for dog food?
N: Eve's look says it all. Ron takes out a list.
C: RON
D: Okay, what about in Germany, this Dextran Sulfate, or in France they got DDC, or AL 721 in Israel... I read that one is proven to work and it ain't toxic.
C: EVE
D: None of those drugs have been approved by the FDA.
C: RON
D: Screw the FDA, I'm gonna be DOA. Do I have to sue this hospital to get me some medicine?
C: EVE
D: Mr. Woodroof, I assure you that would be a waste of precious time.
N: Ron takes a moment, eases up.
C: RON
D: Call me Ron, will ya?
N: Eve doesn't play his game. She writes something down on a piece of paper.
C: EVE
D: There is a support group that meets every day at Draddy Auditorium, perhaps you could share your feelings and concerns...
N: Ron abruptly stands.
C: RON
D: I'm dying and you're tellin' me to go get a hug from a bunch of faggots?
N: Eve watches as Ron backs away. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 17
C: RON
D: Good night, good day, and good riddance.
S: INT. LONESTAR BAR - DAY
N: Ron bursts through the door and shouts to the BARTENDER.
C: RON
D: Neddie Jay, one shot of Cactus and a Rolling Rock back.
N: Ned doesn't move as Ron continues toward a table where T.J., Clint and three other FRIENDS are sitting.
C: RON
D: I can't believe how much I missed your ugly faces. Clint, where you hangin' your pants lately brother?
N: Clint drains his beer, slams it on the table.
C: CLINT
D: Get me another beer, will you sweetheart?
N: The guys burst out laughing.
C: RON
D: `Fuck you say?
C: CLINT
D: I said grab me a cold one, cupcake.
N: Ron looks at him incredulously.
C: RON
D: You askin' me to kick yer ass?
C: CLINT
D: Nah, wouldn't wanna get none of that faggot blood on me.
N: Ron takes a step towards Clint, T.J. gets up and stands between them.
C: T.J.
D: C'mon Ron, we don't want no trouble.
N: Ron puts a fake, friendly hand on T.J.'s shoulder who backs off immediately. Ron moves closer, plays with T.J. and the others. They're all scared of being touched. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 18
C: RON
D: Where you goin', bud? I thought you're my friend.
E: sarcastic
N: Ron looks at him, grabs T.J.'S BEER from his hands and downs it, then fakes as if he's going to hit T.J. with it. T.J. flinches, then Ron SLAMS it on the table. Gives one last look to all of them.
C: RON
D: Fuck all ya'll.
N: And as Ron exits, we PRE-LAP...
C: RICK FERRIS
D: As I stand here tonight, clinical trials are underway with an eye toward fast- tracking AZT and making it available for the public as soon as possible.
E: V.O.
S: INT. DRADDY AUDITORIUM - DALLAS HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT
N: Rick Ferris from Barrow Wilkem stands at the podium before the packed room.
C: RICK FERRIS
D: In short, I'm happy to say that help may finally be on the way.
N: That is Ron's POV as he listens to Ferris, looking around at the crowd, who are almost exclusively gay MEN. Ron wanders toward a table lined with LITERATURE. An EFFEMINATE MAN approaches him with a pamphlet. Ron stares at him blankly. The man opens his arms to give him a hug.
C: EFFEMINATE MAN
D: It's okay brother. We're all getting --
C: RON
D: Tooth fairy, if we weren't in a public place right now, your teeth would be so far down your throat you'd be usin' your ass to chew food.
N: The Man's eyes go wide as he backs off. Ron turns back to the table, takes a few pamphlets. Titles include: "POPPERS STUDY: POSSIBLE CAUSE OF AIDS"; "AZT SHOWS SIGNS OF PROMISE". Ron drifts toward the front, where the CROWD is getting hostile. AUDIENCE MEMBER #1 (O.C.) How long before AZT is approved? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 19
C: RICK FERRIS
D: The FDA standard procedure to approve a new drug is eight to twelve years -
N: AUDIENCE MEMBER #2 (O.C.)
T: (cutting him off)
N: We're dying here!
C: RICK FERRIS
D: We are looking to fast track --
N: AUDIENCE MEMBER #1 (O.C.)
T: (cutting him off)
N: We need it now!
C: RICK FERRIS
D: We're working closely with the FDA to make sure every effort is made--
N: AUDIENCE MEMBER #2 (O.C.) The hell, if it works even a little, we'll take the chance! General shouts of agreement from the CROWD.
C: RICK FERRIS
D: It's both our job and the FDA's to make sure the drug is safe -
C: EFFEMINATE MAN
D: Is it true you can get it in Mexico?!
N: AUDIENCE MEMBER #2 (O.C.) What about dextran sulfate?! As the chaos and shouting continues, Ron walks out in frustration and we're suddenly--
S: INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT
N: CLOSE ON -- a line of flickering CANDLES. That's Ron's POV as he grimaces, despair in his eyes. He doesn't look at the moving, out-of-focus SILHOUETTES in front of him.
C: RON
D: I need to slow it down a second, catch my breath. I'm not ready to crawl into a corner. You hear that? I'm not fucking ready. Man, if you're up there you better be listening. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 19A
E: mumbles to himself MORE
C: RON
D: And if there's a chance, if I got one fucking chance, send me a sign. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 20
E: CONT'D
N: Ron downs a shooter and grimaces again. He slams the glass down on a table among empty glasses and looks up at the candles on a stage in front of a STRIPPER, lost in his thoughts. Then he looks up and sees something across the room, past the stripper. She tries to get his attention.
C: STRIPPER
D: If you're not gonna look or buy a dance, you could at least tip me.
N: Ron stands and throws some bills on the stage.
C: RON
D: I'll take a dance, but not fer me. Just shake it, he'll see you.
N: Ron looks heavenward.
C: RON
D: Thanks.
N: And he walks off towards a man at the end of the bar: the Hispanic Orderly from the hospital.
S: EXT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - REAR - NIGHT
N: Cowboy boots nervously play with a McDonald's Bag on the ground next to a garbage dumpster. They stop when the Hispanic Orderly walks out of the hospital. He gets to the dumpster, throws a BROWN PAPER BAG in it, picks up the McDonald's bag, looks inside and leaves without a word.
S: INT. RON'S TRAILER - NIGHT
N: Ron sits at the table, removes a box of pills from the bag labeled AZT, FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.

S: EXT. OIL FIELD - DAY
N: As Ron pulls up to his jobs site in his battered '73 Lincoln, he spots T.J., Clint and a half dozen other WORKERS through the windshield, all staring at him menacingly.

S: EXT. TRAILER PARK - NIGHT
N: A labyrinth of identical trailers. Ron wanders, searching for his own. Confused, he changes direction and continues to make his way down the different rows. He stops in front of one and stares at the door where two YOUNG BOYS are seated on the steps, staring back at him.
C: RON
D: The hell you doin' here?
N: He waves them aside. As he walks up the steps, his neighbor BUCKY and his WIFE stare at him blankly.

C: EVE
D: Rayon, the whole point of this study is to determine whether AZT is helping people.
C: RAYON
D: Come on, Evie, you know there ain't no helpin' me.
C: EVE
D: That doesn't mean I'm going to stop trying.

S: EXT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - REAR - DAY

C: HISPANIC ORDERLY
D: There ain't no more, they started lockin' it up.
N: The Orderly throws the garbage into the dumpster.
C: RON

N: Ron takes the paper, looks at it.
C: RON
D: What the hell is this bullshit? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 23

N: Eve frowns, didn't expect that.
C: EVE
D: You're in the hospital.
N: Ron blinks. Clears the fantasy. His eyes scan the room.
C: EVE
D: You almost died.
C: RON
D: I'm sure that didn't surprise anyone.
N: Eve seems to smile behind her mask.
C: RON
D: Was that a smile?
N: Eve You've had a blood transfusion. Dr. Sevard steps forward. Dr. Sevard Mr. Woodroof I'm doctor Sevard. Ron I remember you. Dr. Sevard I need you to tell me where you obtained AZT from. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 23A
C: RON
D: Who said I was on AZT?

S: INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - ROOM - NIGHT

C: RAYON
D: Full house. Jacks over threes.
C: RON
D: I'da figured you for queens.
N: Cleaned out, Ron tosses his cards; Rayon scoops up the money.
C: RAYON
D: Sorry darlin'.
N: As Ron starts to unfold his legs, he suddenly SCREAMS in pain, grabbing his calf. Rayon grabs his leg, presses his fingers deep into the muscle and massages. Ron contorts in pain, grips the side of the bed. Rayon goes deeper. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 25
C: RAYON
D: Breath. Relax.
N: Ron breaths. Finally the pain subsides and Ron is left limp.
C: RAYON
D: Here, drink some water.
N: Rayon HOLDS the cup so Ron can drink.
C: RAYON
D: You gotta stay hydrated or your muscles will cramp.
N: Rayon starts to massage Ron's other foot.

C: EVE
D: As your doctor, I cannot recommend you to do this.

C: RON
D: I still live here, you hear me?! I fuckin' live here!! Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 27
N: He looks around, eyes wild, heart racing... but there's no one there to hear him. After a beat, he crosses to his car, pops the trunk. Grabs a single-barreled Winchester SHOTGUN lying within it. He checks the CHAMBER, spins the gun, does a few maneuvers, the barrel pointing at his head. He pumps it, then in a flash levels it and BLASTS the lock off his trailer door.
S: INT. RON'S TRAILER - NIGHT
N: Ron enters, and desperately looks around for something, anything to take with him. He finds HIDDEN CASH in a Patsy Cline Crazy cassette box. A duffel bag on the shoulder, he grabs the TEXAS WILDFLOWER PAINTING off the wall and exits.
S: EXT. TRAILER PARK - NIGHT
N: Ron starts the engine and drives to the two Kids from earlier looking on curiously. Ron gives them a handful of candies he stole from the hospital, and nods toward his trailer.

D: Have fun, kids. It's all yours.
N: And with that, he pulls away.
S: INT. RON'S CAR - HIGHWAY - DAY
N: Ron cruises... feeling as good as he looks. He pulls the car over. Sits there in silence. Breathes in. Looks over at his stuff on the back seat, and then at his gun lying next to him. He grips the steering wheel... and starts to cry.
S: EXT. STREET - MEXICO CITY - DAY
N: Ron's Lincoln rolls down the crowded, impoverished street.
S: INT. RON'S CAR - MEXICO CITY - DAY
N: Ron in the grips of PNEUMONIA, studies a hand drawn map of the city streets. His hands shake, his skin burns with fever. Ron turns down a small side street, stops in front of a nondescript, WHITEWASHED door. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 27A
S: INT. DR. VASS' CLINIC - MEXICO CITY - DAY
N: Ron enters, blind-sided by the mayhem inside. Boxes of drugs and hospital supplies lie in various stages of unpacking. An INTERPRETER shouts above the din to his wealthy ASIAN CLIENT. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 28 DR. VASS (50's), fit but tired, shouts in Spanish to a MAN unloading boxes. He effortlessly switches to Japanese, continues to shout to another worker. Dr. Vass sees Ron, quickly moves over to him.
C: DR. VASS
D: You have something for me to sign?
C: RON
D: I'm lookin' for Dr. Vass.
N: Dr. Vass steps over.
C: DR. VASS

C: DR. VASS
D: That's from the chemical manufacturer who makes AZT, Sigma.
N: Ron looks at the bottle labeled with skull and crossbones: HIGHLY TOXIC, NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.
C: DR. VASS
D: First thing I tell my patients: you won't find that shit here!
N: Ron looks confused. A nearby stack of boxes tumbles over. Dr. Vass shouts to no one in particular.
C: VASS
D: Who stacked those boxes there? Check in with a nurse.
E: to Ron
N: Dr. Vass is off, ripping open boxes. Ron starts to cough again. Badly. Vass notices, and shouts something in Spanish. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 29
S: INT. DR. VASS' CLINIC - MEXICO CITY - DAY
N: Frail and weak, Ron lies on a cot, surrounded by a dozen other PATIENTS of varied nationalities. A NURSE records his vital signs in a chart, then hands it off to Dr. Vass, who peruses the information and begins reading aloud:
C: DR. VASS
D: Cocaine, alcohol, methamphetamine, AZT. That's what I call a recipe for disaster.
E: to Ron
C: RON
D: Doc, this place is a shit-hole.
E: looking around
C: DR. VASS
D: Who said I was a Doctor? They revoked my license to practice three years ago, that's why I'm down in this shit-hole.
C: RON
D: Why? What'd you do?
C: DR. VASS
D: I didn't play ball.
N: Ron smiles.
C: DR. VASS
D: These drugs you're doing, they're breaking down your immune system, making you susceptible to infections.
C: RON
D: So cocaine gave me pneumonia?
C: DR. VASS
D: Cocaine made you more susceptible. As did AZT.
C: RON
D: I thought AZT's supposed to help me.
C: DR. VASS
D: The only people AZT helps are the people who sell it. It kills every cell it comes in contact with, good and bad.
E: beat
C: RON
D: So medically speakin', I kicked my own ass! Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 30
C: DR. VASS
D: I'm prescribing a regimen of vitamins as well as the mineral zinc to build your immune system back up. You'll also be taking Aloe and essential fatty acids.
E: nods as he writes
S: INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - ROOM - DAY
N: In gloves and surgical masks, Eve looks on Nurse Frazin who is drawing blood from Rayon's arm, five other AIDS PATIENTS nearby. That done, the Nurse dispenses meds, giving each patient a paper pill cup marked with a different NUMBER. Rayon takes his pill, winces; Eve makes a mental note, then walks down the line of patients, touching each of them. She comes to Rayon, gives his shoulder a squeeze, then exits. BLACK. SUPER: Six months Later
S: INT. DR. VASS' CLINIC - MEXICO CITY - DAY
N: Medical journals everywhere; on the wall are rows of entomology, various butterflies encased in GLASS. A healthier Ron sits across from Dr. Vass who reads his test results.
C: RON
D: Well?
C: DR. VASS
D: Better. Your T-Cell count's improving.
C: RON
D: Am I still positive for HIV?
C: DR. VASS
D: You'll always test positive for HIV, and now, you have AIDS, due the toxic shit you've been pumping into your body, all the drugs, plus the AZT. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 31
E: MORE
C: DR. VASS
D: You shot your immune system. Now you have chronic pneumonia, among other things. It can cause memory loss, mood swings, aching joints...
E: CONT'D
C: RON
D: If it sucks, I got it.
N: Dr. Vass smiles and holds up a bottle in each hand.
C: DR. VASS
D: This is DDC, it works as an anti viral similar to AZT but less toxic. And this is Peptide T, it's a protein -- totally non-toxic. Early studies have shown it can help with all of that. This is what I had you on since you got here.
C: RON
D: And you can't buy them back in the U.S.?
C: DR. VASS
D: No, not approved.
N: Ron takes the bottle of PEPTIDE T, turns it over in his hand, looks around.
C: RON
D: Chinks, homos and herbs, you got a new world order here, Vass. You could be makin' a fortune off this stuff.
S: EXT. DR. VASS' CLINIC - MEXICO CITY - DAY
N: Ron stares into the trunk of his Lincoln Convertible. VARIOUS BOXES filled with illegal meds are packed to the brim. It won't close. Ron slams it shut. Dr. Vass emerges from the building. He hands Ron a neatly folded black vest, black pants and a detachable clerical collar on top.
C: DR. VASS
D: If you get caught, don't tell them you got AIDS. They'll never let you back in. You've got thirty days to get your ass back down here and pay me the other half, after that I send MIGUEL.

S: EXT. CAR - THE CHIHUAHUAN DESERT - MEXICO - DAY
N: As Ron goes to get out of the car he is pulled back by a PLASTIC TUBE attached to his ARM. We follow it up to a shirt HOOK on the passenger side. An I.V.

C: RON
D: Well as I told the gentlemen, I am a sick man. I have cancer. I take 22 pills a day and these here vials of Vitamin A, C, E and Zinc. That there is ninety days.
N: The man looks at Ron, not really buying it. He takes a bottle of Peptide T and looks at it.
C: RICHARD BARKLEY
D: Vitamins? You do realize that importing unapproved drugs for sale is a very serious offense?
E: no answer from Ron
C: RON
D: Well, as I said, they're not for sale. And they ain't illegal, just "unapproved."
N: A long beat; they stare at each other.
C: RICHARD BARKLEY
D: If we find the slightest indication that you're selling these drugs for profit, you will be thrown in jail... Father.

N: Off his silence, Ron rummages through Rayon's purse, extracts two twenties, pockets them, and starts preparing the syringe.
C: EVE
D: What the hell do you think you're doing?!
C: RON
D: Helpin' him, that's what.
C: EVE
D: He's a participant in a clinical trial, we need to get him to the hospital!

N: Rayon tosses it back at Ron.
C: RAYON
D: You can't tell me what to do.
N: Ron throws the Bologna harder at Rayon, who catches it like a pro football player, much to Ron's surprise.

N: T.J. gives Ron the finger. Ron grabs T.J.'s hand and twists it behind his back. T.J. resists, tries to get out of Ron's grip but can't. He finally extends his hand. Rayon shakes it.
C: RON
D: Good. Now get the fuck outta here and go back to your miserable life.
N: T.J. stares at Ron for a while, angry, humiliated, then leaves. Ron watches him go. Rayon stares at Ron, unsure of how to react to this. A subtle smile appears on his face.
C: RON
D: What?
N: Rayon's moved that Ron stuck up for him. He starts to tear up. Ron sees the bag of chips in the cart and throws it at Rayon. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 48

C: FRANCINE SUSKIND
D: These are for your animal research.
N: Ron winks at her, waits for the delivery man to leave, and produces a plastic BAG filled with vials and drugs.

D: And these are for your daughter.

S: INT. DUNSTON'S STEAK HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Eve waits in a booth. She watches a couple flirt at another table. The WOMAN laughs and tosses her hair back. Eve self consciously tucks her hair behind her ear. She stops, realizes what she's doing. Just then, Ron approaches with the PAINTING.

D: You don't actually believe I would do that?
C: RON
D: Nah. But you gonna have to watch what you say when you're around that snake you work with. He's the virus I'm worried about. As a matter fact, if you hear of anything...
N: She shakes her head, amused. A WAITER approaches.
C: RON
D: Bring us your best bottle of Cabernet.
N: The Waiter nods and leaves.
C: RON

N: She takes a proper sip of wine as he takes a gulp.
C: RON
D: So why'd you become a doctor?
C: EVE
D: Because I was good in science. And my father said studying history was a waste of time. So I went to med school.
C: RON
D: Not what I thought you'd say but makes sense, your dad was a practical man.
C: EVE
D: Yes, he was. Your turn. Why did you become... an electrician, right?
C: RON
D: Well my old man was an electrician. A good one too. But he was a better drinker. Which I learned from him as well.
N: Ron raises his glass in a toast. They share a smile.
C: RON
D: So I was around it a lot. Got pretty good at takin' shit apart, seein' how the insides worked, and then puttin' it back together. I was good at it and it put some change in my pocket.
C: EVE
D: What about your mom? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 64A

D: I do not. I'll hang it. I'm going to hang it. It's just... are you sure you don't want to keep it?
N: Ron looks at her. A long time, then:
C: RON
D: You need to enjoy your life, little lady. You only got one.

N: We hear someone breathing. We're on one of the POSTERS of a bikini clad woman. We pan to another poster of another girl, then another. The breathing is getting more intense. It's obvious that someone is masturbating. Then we're on a POSTER of... Marc Bolan. The breathing stops. Ron walks into frame and tears Bolan's poster down. Then he spots another one. And another one.
C: RON
D: I'm gonna kill him!

D: Sit down and shut up.
N: Ron's POV on the TV.

C: RON
D: In other words, my entire inventory.
N: Ron looks over at one of the FDA Agents, who has begun opening boxes. As the Agent removes an unmarked bottle:
C: RON
D: Aloe vera! It's a plant. What do you give a shit if people eat plants?
C: RICHARD BARKLEY
D: It's improperly labeled. That's a violation of FDA regulations.
C: RON
D: It's a bullshit technicality and you know it! Get my lawyer on the phone.
E: to Rayon
N: Rayon crosses off to make the call.
C: RICHARD BARKLEY
D: Our primary concern is preventing a market for illegal drugs.
C: RON
D: Illegal? Unapproved! These are vitamins and minerals, for Chrissake!
C: RICHARD BARKLEY
D: Vitamins and minerals that gave you a heart attack, remember?
C: RON
D: I'm not selling that stuff, you confiscated it, remember? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 68
N: The agents confiscate lots of small blue boxes and put them in an evidence bag.

C: RON
D: Come on, it's a protein! Effective with dementia which I have. Why don't you just look at my research?
C: RICHARD BARKLEY
D: Woodroof, I wouldn't want you to spend your last days in jail. If you have a product you'd like tested, fill out an application and go through the process.
C: RON
D: Don't threaten me! I'm unapproved motherfucker! The process? That's just FDA bullshit for pay up! 250 million worth!
N: The Agents exit carrying boxes and bags; Barkley gives Ron a big smile.
C: RICHARD BARKLEY
D: You'll be receiving your fine for non compliance and improper labelling soon.

D: Who gave you permission to lower your patients' AZT doses?
C: EVE
D: I don't need permission. I'm their doctor.
C: DR. SEVARD
D: I want those doses readjusted immediately. The study protocol does not allow dose reductions.
C: EVE
D: I'm not doing a study for people who are asymptomatic with a toxic drug that makes them sick. We don't treat people who have antibodies for pneumonia or chicken pox when they're healthy. Why should HIV be any different?
C: DR. SEVARD
D: It's a different kind of virus.
C: EVE
D: Says who? Barrow Wilkem?!
N: Dr. Sevard stares at Eve, who stands her ground.
C: EVE

N: Ron walks out to a table where Rayon is waiting. Rayon has a ledger in front of him. His condition is deteriorating.

C: RON
D: You ain't gettin' tits, Rayon. Memberships are high and so is demand. So we recruit more members from where?
C: RAYON
D: Support groups.
C: RON
D: Yep! I'm gotta find MDs to write them prescriptions so we can keep dealin' these drugs... legally now.

N: A murmur travels through the audience as people listen. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 73
C: RON
D: Some of you may have heard of the Dallas Buyers Club, an organization I founded with my friend Rayon. Risk might be high, but what the hell, you're risking your life every time you go into one of them there hospitals. I don't know where most of the people are who were at these meetings a year and a half ago... maybe they lost interest... maybe they're dead... but I'm here. I'm walking, talking, breathing... and ain't no one gonna take that away from me. I gotta life to lead.
E: beat
N: A murmur travels through the audience as people listen. The point of our club was to get alternative treatments and medications into the hands of those who need 'em. (beat) The cost of joining this club used to be $400 a month. Well I'm here tonight with a special offer. Anyone who's interested can come and sign up for the one-time only, rock bottom price of zero. (beat) That's right, I'm giving it away folks. More murmurs through the crowd.
C: RON
D: HIV don't mean shit. You ain't sick, you ain't sick. Period. You tell a guy he's got a week to live? Shit, he's already dead. You tell a guy he can keep on goin'? He'll find a way. Remember, ya ain't dyin'. But if you think you are then you ain't got nothing to lose.

S: INT. FIRST BANK - DALLAS - DAY
N: A financial institution. A MAN, 50s, walks over to the waiting area and coldly signals a younger man to follow him. This is Rayon, hair slicked back, devoid of makeup and jewelry, wearing Ron's business suit. He gets up. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 73A

C: RAYON
D: I'm fine, thanks. And you? Long time no see.

C: RAYON'S FATHER
D: God help me.
E: shaking his head

N: Rayon throws a cash filled envelope on Ron's desk.
C: RAYON
D: Maybe this will help.
N: Ron looks at the cash in disbelief: two wrapped wads of hundred dollar bills, worth maybe $10,000.

N: Eve enjoys the attention. Shakes her head.
C: RON
D: I knew you'd rain on my party, but I had to give it a shot. Listen, I gotta ask you a favor. I need you to write me prescriptions so I can come across the border. I might not need it but if I do, I'll have them.
E: a beat
N: Eve doesn't respond.
C: RON
D: You know this rule that the FDA just passed was just bullshit. Ain't no doc from here to the north pole will write them.
C: EVE
D: I know and I can't either. I'm sorry. We can't write scripts for random people and random drugs. Plus what if something goes wrong with these drugs? We could get sued, lose our license.
C: RON
D: Okay! Never hurts to ask.
N: Eve takes the hat off and hands it to Ron.

D: You said it.
C: FDA AIRPORT AGENT

C: RON
D: Get away from me. I got AIDS. I'll spit on you.
N: Ron spits on the floor. The guards back off. Dr. Sevard watches slack-jawed as Ron continues to spit. The guards grab him... ... as Eve watches Sevard, emotionally charged.
C: RON
D: You see this? This is harassment. Get me my attorney or do I have to be my own lawyer too. Own doctor, own lawyer.

C: EVE
D: Rayon was a drug addict! It wasn't a day on AZT that killed him, but the disease as a whole!
N: Ron registers. Calms down a bit.

D: Let me ask you something. Let's say I have the cure right here in my back pocket. I could save everyone today.
N: Eve's expression changes.
C: RON
D: But I don't have no funding and I don't have no backing. Now how long is it gonna take before the FDA approves it?
N: Ron crosses to the desk, produces a copy of the Lancet Medical Journal Study he got from Dr. Vass, and hands it to her.
C: RON
D: Read that and you tell me how wrong is too wrong?
S: INT. EVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Eve walks into her house, opens a drawer, removes a hammer, smashes it down on a nail and misses. She smashes the hammer down again, harder, and again, and again. Her POV: lots of holes in the wall, very far from the nail, and soon hidden by Ron's painting of the Texas Wildflowers. She walks away without straightening it, sits down and starts reading the "Lancet Study".

D: I got three thousand people who need to get their hands on Peptide T. Now. Including me.
E: V.O.
S: INT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

C: RON
D: If I don't get it by the end of the week I wanna file a lawsuit.
C: DAVID WAYNE
D: Come on, Ron, we lost the restraining order, remember? We're in Texas. The court system is the last resort for you. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 85
C: RON
D: Well find a place where it's not, Goddamnit. Go to San Francisco, get a sissy judge, figure it out!

C: RON
D: Perfect.

C: EVE
D: What's going on?
C: DR. SEVARD
D: Barrow Wilkem gave us the green light on the AZT pediatric trials.
C: EVE
D: What? This is crazy! All these kids are HIV positive?
N: Sevard looks uneasy.
C: DR. SEVARD
D: We're starting very slowly with a fifth of a dose.
C: EVE
D: Would you give this fifth of a dose to your own child?
N: Touché. Sevard holds her gaze for a moment and leaves.
S: INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - PEDIATRIC WAITING AREA - DAY
N: YOUNG CHILDREN are waiting with their parents. Among them, a girl with her mother, Francine Suskind, the woman from Beaumont Lab whom Ron met earlier. Eve walks in and discreetly places Dallas Buyers Club flyers on a table, then walks off. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 86
S: INT. DRADDY AUDITORIUM - DALLAS HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
N: The room is packed. On the dais stands Richard Barkley from the FDA. To his left and right, are representatives from the Center for Disease Control, the National Institute of Health and ACT-UP. They HEAR something SQUEAKING and look up: At the back of the room, Ron enters, hooked up to an I.V. drip on wheels that he carries along as he starts passing out copies of his flyer.
C: RON
D: Here you go, please read this.
C: RICHARD BARKLEY
D: Mr. Woodroof, will you kindly tell us what you are doing?
E: O.S.
N: Everyone turns to look at Ron.
C: RON
D: I'm givin' people information... on this trial I'm in, right now. I want everyone here to know what's going on.
C: RICHARD BARKLEY
D: And what is going on?
C: RON
D: Why was Peptide T cut off? A non-toxic drug, that I have proof works and that according to the National Institute of Mental Health, is completely safe.
C: RICHARD BARKLEY
D: Mr. Woodroof, you are nothing but a common drug dealer--
C: RON
D: I'm a drug dealer? You're the drug dealer. The pharmaceutical companies are the drug dealers.
N: Ron grabs a bag of jelly beans out of the hands of a person in the audience. Holds them up.
C: RON
D: The yellow number fives, red, green and purple dye you put in this here candy causes seven kinds a cancer.
N: A SECURITY MAN approaches, Ron walks away from him. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 87
C: RON
D: The aspartame in my diet coke, the steroids in my meat, the hormones in my milk, the antibiotics in the chicken. Now that's the shit the FDA knows will kill you. Yet you're all up there worried that some sick people will find somethin' without you and y'all won't get paid.
N: Ron throws the bag of jelly beans to the security man who catches it. And he leaves the room, squeaking away.

C: EVE
D: I won't. You'll have to fire me.
N: She starts to leave, stops, turns around.
C: EVE
D: Y'all go fuck yourselves!

N: Ron appears from the kitchen with a beer.
C: RON

N: Ron cracks the beer and hands her the can. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 88
C: RON
D: That was a ballsy move!
N: Eve looks away. Ron opens his arms...
C: RON
D: A nice, warm hug... ...and a day of watchin' some bull ridin', that's what you need, doctor Woodroof's order.
E: she accepts it
N: She smiles and they both let go, uneasy with the closeness.
C: RON
D: Don't you miss a regular life?
C: EVE
D: Regular? What's that? Doesn't exist.
C: RON
D: Yeah, I guess. I just want...
E: a beat
N: Ron looks at her.
C: EVE
D: What?
N: He takes the can back.
C: RON
D: ... an ice-cold beer at Ruby's. Go dancin' with my woman. I want kids... thumb wrestle with my sons. I don't know. I got one life -- mine. But I want someone else's. I feel I'm fighting for a life I ain't got the time to live.
N: Ron downs some beer.
C: RON
D: I want it all to mean somethin'.
N: Eve looks at Ron, studies him.
C: EVE
D: It does. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 89
S: INT. EVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Eve looks at the painting of the Texas Wildflowers. For some reason, she becomes emotional and decides to straighten it.
S: INT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB HOUSE - BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING
N: CLOSE ON Ron's box of meds, almost empty. By the look on his face, Ron clearly just woke up. But there is something else. He takes an empty bottle of Peptide T and looks at it, confused. Hears the strange ringing again...
S: INT. RON'S CAR - DALLAS STREET - DAY
N: And that is all we hear as we see Ron driving along the street into the middle of an intersection. Ron stops the car, puts his hands over his ears, and walks out.
S: EXT. STREET - DALLAS - DAY
N: Ron tries to direct traffic, bear foot. People blare their car horns. Others scream out their windows. A POLICEMAN arrives on the scene and approaches Ron. Tucker pulls up and sees Ron, he jumps out of his car.
C: TUCKER
D: I'll take care of this.
N: Tucker steps in. He grabs Ron's arm, makes eye contact.
C: TUCKER
D: Ron! You are in the middle of the street. Do you understand what I'm sayin'?
N: No answer from Ron.
C: TUCKER
D: Come on, man, let's go home.

S: INT. TUCKER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Tucker's father sits in a chair facing Ron.
C: TUCKER'S FATHER
D: Of course I remember you, trouble maker.
C: RON
D: I still am!
N: They share a smile.
C: RON
D: I'm glad you're doin' better, sir.
C: TUCKER
D: I'm gonna talk with Ron a minute, pop.
N: Tucker steps off to the side with Ron.
C: TUCKER
D: Listen, the FDA is gonna bust you tomorrow.
N: Ron's wheels are turning.
C: RON
D: Thanks for the tip, Tuck.
N: And as Ron exits the house...
C: TUCKER
D: I'll be there, man, and don't you fuckin' hit me again!
S: EXT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB HOUSE - DAY
N: A line of customers is out the door as three Dallas Police Cars pull up. As Tucker gets out of the lead car, he is greeted by Richard Barkley and two FDA Agents. They head inside. That's Ron's POV...
S: INT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: ...as he's watching from a window. Eve tends to several buyers club members, I.V.s attached to them, lying on the floor. A NEWS TEAM films the entire thing. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 91
C: EVE
D: This is Fluconazole. It helps them with Thrush.
E: to the reporter
N: Suddenly, the front door OPENS. Police are in the room, guns drawn.
C: RICHARD BARKLEY
D: No one move. Put your hands in the air.
N: The news camera keeps rolling.
C: TUCKER
D: Ronald Woodroof?
N: Ron steps up through the crowd.
C: TUCKER
D: I have a warrant for your arrest, a search warrant for the premises, and a court order to cease and desist business immediately.
N: And with that, Ron allows Tucker to handcuff him. And as he does, the Customers "Boo" and "Hiss" loudly, all caught on by the News Crew.
C: RICHARD BARKLEY
D: Turn off that camera. Now!
N: But the Camera Man doesn't stop filming.
C: RICHARD BARKLEY
D: Please instruct the rest of these people to leave, now.
E: to Ron
C: RON
D: I ain't no cop. Why'nt you tell 'em?
N: Tucker escorts Ron outside.
S: EXT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB HOUSE - DAY
N: The News Crew continues to film as Ron is led out past the waiting Customers, talking to the reporter.
C: RON
D: It's the bust of the century! Don't they look like hardened criminals?! Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 92
N: An ambulance pulls up. MEN wearing MASKS and GLOVES begin to escort people off. Barkley and his Agents watch the circus from the sidewalk. Ron is put in the Squad Car by Tucker.
S: INT. DALLAS POLICE STATION - HOLDING ROOM - DAY
N: David Wayne enters and throws a NEWSPAPER on the table in front of Ron.
C: RON
D: Deadly drugs? What the fuck?
C: DAVID WAYNE
D: They wrote the FDA's story.
C: RON
D: I can't believe it. I tipped those assholes off.
C: DAVID WAYNE
D: Don't worry. I got good news. I got you a change of venue for the Peptide T trial in San Francisco. And no surprise, they're not pressing charges.
C: DAVID WAYNE
D: Then what the fuck am I doin' here?
C: DAVID WAYNE
D: They're trying to break you, I don't know. Let's get out of here.
N: They leave.
C: RON
D: They'll never break me.
E: to himself
S: EXT. COURTHOUSE - SAN FRANCISCO
N: We see Ron's reflection in the window of a cab that moves out of the way as Ron starts walking towards the Courthouse, helped by David Wayne who holds his arm.
T: A SUPER fades in.
N: U.S. District Court Northern District of California Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 92A
S: INT. COURTROOM - SAN FRANCISCO
N: Ron, dressed in a conservative suit, is looking extremely ill. Next to him is David Wayne and two other younger ATTORNEYS. On the opposing side are FDA representatives including Richard Barkley and others who we haven't ever seen before. They have a team of four attorneys.
C: JUDGE
D: The constitution, specifically the ninth amendment, does not state that you have the right to be mentally healthy or physically healthy. It does state that you have a right to chose your own medical care but that is interpreted as medical care that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
N: The Judge looks over to the FDA table.
C: JUDGE
D: Regarding the FDA, the court is highly disturbed by its bullying tactics and direct interference with a drug whose own agency has found to be non-toxic. The FDA was formed to protect people, not prevent them from getting help.
N: The Judge sighs.
C: JUDGE
D: The law does not seem to make much common sense. If a person has been found to be terminally ill they ought to be able to take just about any drug they feel will help... but that is not the law. Mr. Woodroof, there is not a person in this courtroom who is not moved to compassion by your plight, what is lacking here is the legal authority to intervene. I'm sorry. This case is hereby dismissed.
N: The Judge bangs the gavel. David Wayne raises in frustration. Ron closes his eyes, defeated. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 93
S: INT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Ron, still looking sick, opens the door and is startled by a crowd of people clapping and cheering.
C: RON
D: Jesus Mother Mary Fucking Christ!
N: Among the crowd, Ron spots Eve and David Wayne with a smile of victory on their faces. Ron doesn't understand. They walk to him and show him a paper with the FDA logo on it. Black. Super: Following the trial, the FDA in Washington allowed Ron to get Peptide T for his own personal use. And as the cheering and clapping grow bigger, we cut to:
S: EXT. RODEO - DAY
N: Ron, 20 pounds heavier, looking healthier, is sitting atop the railing above the stall looking down at the bull. He's got on gloves, hat, pants, and boots, ready to ride. He removes a flask from his pocket and takes a long swig. The BULLHAND and Ron exchange a look. Ron nods, takes a deep breath, swings his legs over the railing, straddles the stall, stays above the animal. The moment Ron's ass hits the leather, the gate is up, the bull is out, and the crowd whoops it up. Rodeo contestant number "43" Ron Woodroof rides the bull, his hands, legs and heels all working together. His "off" hand is held out above him, cutting the air for balance. The bull makes an abrupt change of direction, catches Ron off guard and just when it seems that he's about to be thrown in the air, we hear Eve screaming her guts out as the image freezes on a PERFECT FRAME on this cowboy in action to control the beast. The crowd's CHEERS are echoing in the distance, blended with the soft strange ring that we know, that only Ron could hear. And as we zoom in on the image:
T: FADE TO BLACK.
N: Ronald Woodroof died on September 12, 1992, seven years after he was diagnosed with the HIV virus. He managed to stay alive using unapproved drugs and was memorialized by 1000 gay men in Dallas, Texas. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 93A-95
T: FADE OUT.
N: Fluconazole and Alpha Interferon are now FDA approved. DDC was approved in 1992 but is no longer used due to its highly toxic effects. Peptide T remains unapproved but still in studies for neurological diseases, like Alzheimer. Today, it is had been scientifically proven that HIV is the cause of AIDS. Based on this knowledge, great strides have been made in treating this infection with anti-HIV medications but a cure has yet to be discovered. The first studies with AZT as a single drug (monotherapy) while showing initial good results did not ultimately prove to be a long term solution for HIV treatment. By 1996, medical researchers learned that HIV is best treated with a combination cocktail of at least three HIV medications. AZT was frequently used as a part of these early combination therapies. Today, AZT has been largely replaced by safer, new HIV medications. *
