M: Screenplay by
M: Kevin Smith
M: OVER BLACK WE SEE:
M: CHYRON
N: A long time ago, in front of a convenience store far, far away--
S: EXT. QUICK STOP YEARS AGO--DAY
N: We FADE IN on the block of stores (Quick Stop/RST), from sometime ago, In fact, RST isn't RST; it's THE RECORD RACK -- a 45's store with head shop paraphernalia in the window. A white-trash MOTHER (maybe seventeen) wearing a baseball cap comes into frame carrying a chubby BABY. The Baby wears an oversized t-shirt under what looks like a little bathrobe, and messily eats a CHOCOLATE BAR. There are food stamps in the Mother's hands.
C: MOTHER
D: Bobby-Boy stay here while mommy picks up the free cheese, 'kay?
N: She looks up at the bright sun, shielding her eyes slightly, then looks back at the baby on the ground. She takes off her baseball cap and places it on the baby.
C: MOTHER
D: This'll keep the sun out of your eyes. You be good now.
N: She walks away, leaving the baby sitting against the wall. With the backwards baseball cap and the chocolate around his mouth forming something that resembles a beard, the kid looks kind of familiar. Then, another MOTHER (also very young) decked out in a KISS concert shirt from years gone by and huge, feathered hair enters, with a black skullcap wearing BABY slung at her hip. She sees the first Baby, sitting against the wall and sets her Baby down beside him.
C: MOTHER
D: Don't fucking move, you little shit- machine. Mommy's gonna try to score.
N: A PASSERBY enters, heading toward the convenience store. He takes note of the Babies and the Mother heading into the record store, and then stops and addresses her, disgusted.
C: PASSERBY
D: Excuse me--who's watching these babies?
C: MOTHER
D: The fat one's watching the little one.
C: PASSERBY
D: Oh, nice parenting. Leave'em out here like that and see what happens.
E: walking away
N: The Passerby walks away. The Mother flips him the bird.
C: MOTHER
D: FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING SQUARE!
C: PASSERBY
D: Ah, keep on truckin'.
E: waving her off
C: MOTHER
D: D'jou hear the crazy fuck tellin' me how to fuckin' raise you? Motherfucker, man! Who's he fucking think he is? What's the worse fuckin' thing could happen to you sitting outside the fuckin' stores? Fuck!
E: to baby
N: The door closes, and the Babies sit there quietly for a beat. Then, they look at each other. The larger one says nothing. The smaller one says--
C: BABY
D: Fuck, fuck, fuck...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: THE PRESENT JAY and SILENT BOB stand where the Babies sat. The Record Rack is now RST VIDEO. Jay is mid-chant.
C: JAY
D: --fuck, fuck, fuck, mother-mother fuck, mother-mother fuck-fuck! Mother- fuck-, mother-fuck, mother-fuck, noinch, noinch, noinch, smoking weed, smoking weed, doing coke, drinking beers! Drinking beers, beers, beers, rolling fatties, smoking blunts! Who smokes the blunts? We smoke the blunts!
E: as a chant
N: A pair of TEENS approach them. TEEN 1 Lemme get a nickel bag.
C: JAY
D: Fifteen bucks, little man. Put the money in my hand. If the money does not show, then you owe-me-owe-me- owe. My Jungle Love! Yes, Oh-we-oh-we-oh! I think I want to know ya', know ya'--
E: changing up to Morris Day
N: TEEN 1 (digging in pockets) What the hell are you singing?
C: JAY
D: You don't know "Jungle Love"? That shit is the mad notes. Written by God Herself and handed down to the world's greatest band--the motherfucking Time.
N: TEEN 2 The guys in that Prince movie? TEEN 1 Purple Rain. TEEN 2 Man, that shit was so gay--fucking eighties style. Jay suddenly grabs the kid by the throat, throwing him against the wall.
C: JAY
D: Bitch, don't you NEVER say an unkind word about The Time! Me and Silent Bob modeled our whole fucking lives after Morris Day and Jerome! I'm a smooth pimp who loves the pussy, and Tubby here's my black manservant!
N: Just then, RANDAL exits the video store, locking the door behind him.
C: RANDAL
D: What'd I tell you two about dealing in front of the store? Drop the kid and peddle your wares someplace else, burn-boy. And for the record, The Time sucked ass.
E: walking away
N: He exits. Jay, Silent Bob, and the Teens watch him go. After a beat--
C: JAY
D: Yo-youse guys wanna hear something fucked up about him and the Quick Stop guy?
S: INT. QUICK STOP-DAY
N: Randal joins Dante behind the counter. Dante rings up a customer, a half-eaten submarine sandwich sitting on the counter. Randal grabs it, takes a bite, and starts reading a newspaper.
C: RANDAL
D: Hey, can't we do something about those two stoners hanging around outside all the time?
C: DANTE
D: Why? What'd they do now?
C: RANDAL
D: I'm trying to watch Clash of the Titans, and all I can hear is the two them screaming about Morris Day at the top of their lungs.
C: DANTE
D: I thought the fat one didn't really talk much.
C: RANDAL
D: What, am I producing an A&E Biography about 'em? I'm just saying they shouldn't be loitering around the stores like they do.
C: DANTE
D: Neither should you, but we let you stay.
C: RANDAL
D: See, man--if you were funnier than that, ABC never would've canceled us.
C: DANTE
D: What?
C: RANDAL
D: Nothing.
N: Enter Teen 1 and Teen 2, chuckling. TEEN 1 Two packs of Wraps. (beat) Yo--how was the service?
C: RANDAL
D: What service?
N: TEEN 2 The one at the Unitarian church where you two got married to each other last week.
C: RANDAL
D: What the hell are you talking about?
N: TEEN 1 Jay said you had a Star-Wars--themed wedding and you guys tied the knot dressed like storm troopers. TEEN 2 Yeah. And he said you're the bitch and you're the butch. Oh, sorry--the Leia and the Luke.
C: DANTE
D: I'm the bitch?!
C: RANDAL
D: Well if we were gay, that's how I'd see it.
C: DANTE
D: Would you shut up?!
N: TEEN 1 (to TEEN 2) Holy shit, dude. The honeymoon's over.
C: DANTE
D: We're not married to each other.
N: TEEN 1 Well, sure. Not in the eyes of the state or any real church, Skywalker.
C: RANDAL
D: That does it. I'm gonna do something about those two. I shoulda done a long time ago
E: heading for the phone
N: TEEN 2 In a galaxy far, far away! TEEN 1 (exiting) May the Foreskin be with you. Hand Jabba the Hutt.
C: RANDAL
D: Yeah, I want to report a couple of drug dealers out in front of the Quick Stop.
E: into phone
S: EXT. QUICK STOP--DAY
N: Jay and Silent Bob are thrown against the wall outside by a COP, who frisks them.
C: JAY
D: What the Fuck, Serpico? What'd we do?
C: COP
D: We got a report that two guys were hanging around outside the stores, selling pot?
C: JAY
D: We don't smoke pot, yo.
N: Teen 1 enters and hands Jay rolling papers. TEEN 1 Here're the rolling papers you wanted for your pot. And your change. Thanks. (getting in Jay's face) And The Time sucks ass! Teen 1 races off. Jay and Bob move to follow, but the Cop stops them, grabbing the rolling papers out of Jay's hand. He eyeballs the pair.
C: COP
D: No pot, hunh? What do you need this for?
C: JAY
D: What? I got a wiping problem. I stick these little pieces of paper over my brown-eye, and bam--no shit stains in my undies. You don't believe me? Lemme show you.
E: unbuttoning pants
N: Jay drops his pants and leans against the wall, looking back over his shoulder.
C: JAY
D: Just spread my cheeks a little and you can see the fucking stink nuggets--
C: COP
D: Pull up your pants up sir, Now!
N: Jay bends down to pull up his pants and FARTS. Silent Bob cracks up. The Cop grabs them both, leading them toward the car.
C: COP
D: Let's take a ride down to the station.
C: JAY
D: What? It's suddenly a crime to fart, motherfucker?!
S: EXT. BRODIE BRUCE'S SECRET STASH COMIC BOOK STORE--DAY
N: An ESTABLISHING SHOT of Brodie's store in the heart of Red Bank.
C: BRODIE
D: No fucking way!
E: O.S.
N: WE GO TIGHT on the huge, cartoon sign of BRODIE outside to--
S: INT. BRODIE BRUCE'S SECRET STASH COMIC BOOK STORE--LATER
N: BRODIE himself, holding a stack of comics in one hand and a Dixie cup in the other, Jay and Silent Bob follow him as he puts new books in the racks.
C: BRODIE
D: Dante and Randal slapped you with a restraining order?!
C: JAY
D: Judge said if we go within a hundred feet of the stores, we get thrown into County.
C: BRODIE
D: So you gonna abide by the court's ruling or you gonna go Bandit-- Reynolds style?
C: JAY
D: Fuck yeah! You know what they make you do in county? Toss the fucking salad! I don't like this fuck's asshole; I'm gonna do it for some stranger?
C: BRODIE
D: I guess if you really wanted to hang out in from of a convenience store, you could just buy your own now-- what with all that money you guys made.
C: JAY
D: Hell yeah, bitch. Wait a second--what money?
E: beat
C: BRODIE
D: The money from the movie, dumb-ass.
C: JAY
D: What the fuck are you babbling about?
C: BRODIE
D: The Bluntman and Chronic movie. Oh my God--don't tell me you have no idea there's a movie being made of the comic you two were the basis for.
E: pulling a bagged-and- boarded issue down from the wall dawns on him
C: JAY
D: What?! Since when?
C: BRODIE
D: Goddamit, man-- Here's the pulse, alright. And here's your finger-- --far from the pulse, jammed straight up your ass. Say--would you like a chocolate covered pretzel?
E: taps his wrist shoves his hand down the back of his pants extracts hand and extends it to Jay
N: Brodie leads them back to the counter.
C: BRODIE
D: You see, kids, if you read Wizard, you'd know it's the top story this month. Check it out.
N: Brodie hands Jay and Silent Bob a copy of Wizard, opened to the headline: Snootchie Bootchies! Bluntman and Chronic Get Big Screen Treatment! There are pictures of HOLDEN MCNEIL AND BANKY EDWARDS, as well as drawings of Bluntman and Chronic.
C: JAY
D: When the fuck did this happen?!
C: BRODIE
D: Well, after X-Men hit at the box office, all the studios started buying up every comic property they could get their hands on. Miramax optioned Bluntman and Chronic.
C: JAY
D: Miramax? I thought they only made classy flicks like The Piano and The Crying Game?
C: BRODIE
D: Yeah, well once they made She's All That, everything went to hell. So you're saying you haven't gotten a cut of the movie? Didn't Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards used to pay you likeness rights for the comic book?
C: JAY
D: We haven't seen a fucking dime for no movie!
C: BRODIE
D: Well boys, I'm no lawyer, but I think Holden and Banky owe you some of the proverbial phat cash. I mean they're making a movie based on characters that are based on you and Quiet Robert.
C: JAY
D: It ain't me and Quiet Robert. It's a pair of stupid-ass superheroes that run around saying "Snitchy-Nitchies" or something.
C: BRODIE
D: I believe it "Snootchie Boochies." Regardless--you're getting screwed. If I was you guys, I'd confront Holden McNeil and ask him for my movie check.
C: JAY
D: Shit yeah. We gotsa get paid.
C: BRODIE
D: And on that note, we cue the music.
N: Jay lays down a House bass beat. Brodie complements it with his own beat.
S: EXT. POTZER'S INC--DAY
N: Jay and Silent Bob mosey past the front door of the building and knock.
S: INT. POTZER'S INC--DAY
N: Holden McNeil, opens the door and smiles.
C: HOLDEN
D: Well! I have been waiting years to do this. Look at these morose motherfuckers right here. Smells like someone shit in their cereal. Bunngg!
E: smiles
N: Jay and Silent Bob enter. Holden closes the door, following them.
C: JAY
D: What the fuck took you so long answering your damn door? You trying to talk another girlfriend of yours into some of that gay-ass three-way action with your buddy?
C: HOLDEN
D: No, I was just showering your mother's stink off me after I gave her a quick jump and sent her home. But now that you mention it-- Thanks, you know. You could've made the moral of that story you told me a bit more clear.
E: to Bob
N: Silent Bob shrugs.
C: HOLDEN
D: So what brings you two dirt merchants to my neck of the woods?
C: JAY
D: Oh, I'll tell you what our necks are doing in your woods--
N: Silent Bob holds up the Wizard article.
C: JAY
D: Where's our motherfucking movie check?
C: HOLDEN
D: You heard about that too, Hunh? Well, I've got nothing to do with it. That's Banky's deal. He owns the property now. I signed my half of the Bluntman and Chronic right over to him years ago.
C: JAY
D: Why the fuck would you do a thing like that?
C: HOLDEN
D: Because I'm almost thirty, for God's sake--why on earth would I want to keep writing about characters whose central preoccupations are weed and dick and fart jokes? You gotta grow, man. Don't you ever want more for yourself? I know this poor, hapless sonovabitch does. I look in his doe eyes and I see a man crying out, "When, Lord? When the fuck can your servant ditch this foul-mouthed little chucklehead to whom I am a constant victim of his folly, and who bombards me and those around us with grade-A foolishness that prevents me from even getting to kiss a girl? Fuck! When?!
E: off Silent Bob
N: Silent Bob nod like he's finally understood. Jay looks at him, hurt, and Bob tried to downplay the comment's truth.
C: JAY
D: I'm the chucklehead? Fuck you--you're the dumb-ass who gave away his comic, and now you ain't got no fat movie check neither.
C: HOLDEN
D: When you're right, you're right. I wish I'd broken off a little piece for myself. Because if the buzz is any indication, the movie's gonna make some huge bank.
C: JAY
D: What buzz?
C: HOLDEN
D: The Internet buzz.
C: JAY
D: What the fuck is the Internet?
S: INT. OFFICE OF POTZER'S INC--LATER
N: Holden's at a computer terminal. Jay and Silent bob look over his shoulder.
C: HOLDEN
D: The Internet is a communication device that allows people the world over to bitch about movies and share pornography with one another. Here's what we're looking for: "Movie PoopShoot.com"
E: off monitor
C: JAY
D: "PoopChute." Yeaaahhh.
E: to Bob
C: HOLDEN
D: This is a site full of militant movie buffs: sad bastards who live in their parents' basements, downloading scripts and trading what they believe to be inside info about movies and actors they despise yet can't stop discussing. This is where you go if you wanna hear frustrated would-be filmmakers mouth off with their two- bit, arm-chair-director's opinions on how they all could've made a better Episode One.
N: On the computer monitor, we see the site mainpage load up. Holden begins navigating the site.
C: HOLDEN
D: Here. This is about the Bluntman movie. "Inside sources tell me Miramax is starting production this Friday on their adaptation of underground comic fave Bluntman and Chronic."
E: reading
C: JAY
D: Friday?! Shit. Does it say who's playing us in the movie?
C: HOLDEN
D: No, but if it's Miramax, I'm sure it'll be Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. They put'em in a bunch of movies.
C: JAY
D: Who?
C: HOLDEN
D: You know--the guys from Good Will Hunting.
C: JAY
D: You mean the fucking movie with Mork from Ork in it?
C: HOLDEN
D: Yeah, I'm not too big a fan either. Though Affleck was the bomb in Phantoms.
C: JAY
D: Word, bitch. Phantoms like a motherfucker.
N: Holden and Jay slap hands. Holden points at the monitor again.
C: HOLDEN
D: Now down here is where you can gauge the buzz. This is the Shoot Back area. It's where people who read the news get to chime in with their two cents. Here's what a guy who goes by the chick-magnet Net handle of "Wampa- One" thinks about Bluntman and Chronic. "Bluntman and Chronic and their stupid alter egos Jay and Silent Bob only work in small doses, if at all. They don't deserve their own movie." He's got a point.
E: reading to Jay
C: JAY
D: Fuck him. What's the next one say?
C: HOLDEN
D: "Bluntman and Chronic is the worst comic I ever read. Jay and Silent Bob are stupid characters. A couple of stoners who spout dumb-ass catchphrases like a third-rate Cheech and Chong or Bill and Ted. Fuck Jay and Silent Bob. Fuck them up their stupid asses."
E: reading
C: JAY
D: Who the fuck said that shit?!
C: HOLDEN
D: A guy who calls himself "Magnolia- Fan." Check out what the guy after him said: "Jay and Silent Bob are terrible, one-note jokes that only stoners laugh at. They're fucking clown shoes. If they were real, I'd beat the shit out of them for being so stupid. I can't believe Miramax would have anything to so with this shit. I, for one, will be boycotting this movie. Who's with me?" And then there are about fifty more posts from people who agree to join Spartacus-here's boycott of the flick.
E: leans back
C: JAY
D: I'm gonna kill all these fucks--
E: grimly
C: HOLDEN
D: Ah, let it go. Number one, they're a bunch of jealous little dicks who use the anonymity of the Net to insult people who're doing what they wish they were doing, and number two, they're not really talking about you guys--they talking about Bluntman and Chronic.
C: JAY
D: But they said Jay and Silent Bob! They used our real names. It doesn't matter that there's a comic book version of us and a real version, 'cause nobody knows we're real in real life.
C: HOLDEN
D: Really.
C: JAY
D: Yeah! And all these people who read that shit think the real Jay and Silent Bob are a couple of faggots 'cause of that all these dicks are writing about the comic book Jay and Silent Bob! And maybe one night, me and Lunchbox'll be macking some bitch, and she'll be like "Oooo! I want to suck youse guys dicks off. What's your names?" And I'll be like, "Jay and Silent Bob." And she'll be like, "Oh--I read on the Internet that youse guys were little fucking jerkoffs." And then she goes and sucks two other guys's dicks off instead! Well fuck that! We gotta put a stop to these hateful sonsa- bitches before they ruin our good names!
C: HOLDEN
D: First off, I don't know how good your names really are. Secondly, there's not much you can do about stopping this bile. The Internet's given everyone in America a voice, and everyone in American has chosen to use that voice to bitch about movies. As long as there's a Bluntman and Chronic movie, the Net-nerds are gonna have something negative to say about it. Jay steams, thinking. Then, a light dawns on him.
C: JAY
D: But wait a second--if there wasn't a Bluntman and Chronic movie, then no one would be saying shit about Jay and Silent Bob, right?
C: HOLDEN
D: They're not saying anything about you now--they're talking about fictional characters!
C: JAY
D: So all we gotta do is stop 'em from making the movie!
E: oblivious to Holden; to Bob
C: HOLDEN
D: Yeah, and kiss-off the hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties you're due in the process. Are you fucking retarded? Look, I'm probably not alone in the opinion that this flick is the worst idea since Greedo shooting first. I mean, a Jay and Silent Bob movie? Who would pay to see that?
N: Holden, Jay and Silent Bob pause and look at the camera for a beat. Then--
C: HOLDEN
D: But since it is happening, you might as well just ignore the idiots on the Internet, go find Banky, and get your "motherfucking movie check." As you so succinctly put it. That's what's important here.
C: JAY
D: No, Holden McNeil--what's important here is that there's a bunch of motherfuckers we don't even know calling us assholes on the Internet to a bunch of teenagers and guys who can't even get laid. Putting a stop to that is the most important thing we could ever do. When did it say they're making that movie?
E: off monitor
C: HOLDEN
D: They start this Friday.
C: JAY
D: So if today's Tuesday, that gives us-- Eight days.
E: counts
C: HOLDEN
D: It's more like three days.
C: JAY
D: Right. Three days to stop that stupid fucking movie from getting made! C'mon, Silent Bob--
N: Jay and Bob stand and look at each other, filled with purpose.
C: JAY
D: We're going to Hollywood.
N: They stride off. Holden shakes his head.
C: HOLDEN
D: Now that's what I call the Blunt leading the Blunt.
S: EXT. BUS STATION--DAY
N: Jay and Silent Bob approach a bus that's labeled "Los Angeles." They nod at each other and then climb aboard. After a beat, they re-emerge.
C: JAY
D: Tickets? Since when did they start charging for the bus?
N: They head toward the depot.
C: JAY
D: Didn't we used to ride that shit to school every day for free?
S: EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY
N: The bus roars past a sign that read: Leaving New Jersey.
S: INT. BUS--SAME
N: Jay makes his way up to the DRIVER.
C: JAY
D: We in Hollywood yet?
C: DRIVER
D: It's a three--day ride to Los Angeles, sir. We left twenty minutes ago.
C: JAY
D: I didn't ask you about Los Angeles. I asked you about Hollywood.
C: DRIVER
D: Hollywood's in Los Angeles, sir.
C: JAY
D: Don't change the subject! Are we in Hollywood yet or not?
C: DRIVER
D: Please sit down, sir.
N: Jay glares at the Driver and heads back to his seat.
C: JAY
D: Why don't you take your seat Ralph Kramden--
N: Jay slumps into the seat beside Silent Bob.
C: JAY
D: I'm fucking bored, man. There ain't shit to so on this bus.
N: Silent Bob mimes jerking off.
C: JAY
D: I already did that. Twice.
N: Silent Bob shrugs, looking out the window, Jay looks across the aisle and spots a CHILD IN A HELMET playing a handheld video game. He leans over to him.
C: JAY
D: Yo, Gretzky--lemme get a turn.
C: CHILD
D: Leave me alone, little kid.
N: The Child gives him the finger. Jay goes wide-eyed, turning to Silent Bob.
C: JAY
D: That fuck called me a little kid and gave me the finger! Go kick his ass!
N: Silent Bob offers an incredulous look, as if to say, "He's ten years old."
C: JAY
D: You're my muscle, ain'tcha?
N: Silent Bob kind of nods.
C: JAY
D: So go open a can of whup-ass on that little fuck, and get me his game!
N: Silent Bob sighs and stands. He climbs over Jay into the aisle and stands in front of the child. He looks at him and registers doubt. He looks back to Jay, who waves him on. Silent Bob steels himself, looks back to the kid and reaches for his game. The Child emits a high-pitched scream and starts punching himself in the head. Silent Bob dives back into his seat, trying to look nonchalant. The Child stops crying. Jay looks at Silent Bob.
C: JAY
D: You're one tough motherfucker, you know that?
S: EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY
N: The bus pulls over by the side of the road.
S: INT. BUS--DAY
N: The Bus Driver heads down the aisle toward the back of the bus, followed by pissed-off PASSENGERS.
C: PASSENGER
D: They been in there going on half an hour now! Two of them! Doing God knows what!
N: The Bus Driver bangs on the bathroom door and shouts.
C: DRIVER
D: This bus isn't moving another inch unless you clear out of there right now!
N: No answer. The Bus Driver bangs on the door harder.
C: DRIVER
D: DO YOU HEAR ME?! OPEN THIS DOOR! NOW!!
N: The door handle turns, the door swings wide, and massive amounts of smoke suddenly billow through the back of the bus. The smoke clears to reveal Jay and Silent Bob squeezed into the bathroom, holding a massive joint.
C: JAY
D: Um--I think something's burning back here.
S: EXT. ROADSIDE--LATER
N: As the bus pulls away, Jay and Silent Bob are revealed, left behind.
C: JAY
D: The whole fucking world's against us, dude. I swear to God.
N: Silent Bob nods. Jay sticks out his thumb and starts hitching.
S: EXT. ROADSIDE--LATER
N: Jay and Bob are walking backwards, hitching still.
C: JAY
D: This sucks balls, man. How come we ain't getting no rides?
C: VOICE
D: 'Cause you're doing it all wrong.
N: Jay and Bob look behind them. There's a GUY hitching as well.
C: GUY
D: You gotta induce the drivers a little.
C: JAY
D: Like how?
C: GUY
D: Like this.
N: The GUY holds out his sign to them. It reads: Will Give Head For Ride.
C: JAY
D: Yeah, but what happens when you get in the car, and you don't make with the head? Don't they kick your ass to the curb?
C: GUY
D: Sure--if you don't make with the head.
N: Jay and Bob look at him for a long beat. Then--
C: JAY
D: Eww! You eat the cock?!?
C: GUY
D: Yeah. If it'll get me a few hundred miles across country. I'll take a shot in the mouth.
C: JAY
D: Yeah, but we ain't gay.
C: GUY
D: Well, neither am I. But have you seen the price of bus tickets lately? Shit--I don't wanna cough up two hundred bucks just to get to Chicago.
C: JAY
D: Well, I don't wanna cough up some dude's sperm!
C: GUY
D: Don't be so suburban--this is the new millennium. Gay, straight--it's all the same now. There're no more lines.
N: Jay draws a line on the ground with his foot.
C: JAY
D: There's one. On this side of it, we ain't gay.
C: GUY
D: All hitchers do this. Why do you think people pick us up? If you get a ride, it's expected--I don't care who the driver is. It's the first rule in the Book.
C: JAY
D: What book?
C: GUY
D: The unwritten Book of the Road.
N: A TRUCK starts to pull over to the side of the road. The Guy points to it, as if to say "See?" The passenger-side door opens. The Guy climbs into the truck and closes the door. He looks out the window at Jay and Bob.
C: GUY
D: Follow the rules of the Book, and you'll get where you're going in no time. Excuse me.
N: Through the windshield, Jay and Silent Bob see the Guy go face-first into the TRUCK DRIVER'S lap. The Truck Drivers smiles, and the truck takes off, roaring down the road. Jay and Silent Bob watch the truck disappear. Then, a CAR pulls up. The NUN driving rolls down the passenger side window and leans toward them.
C: NUN
D: You two boys need a ride?
S: INT. CAR--LATER
N: The NUN drives, smiling. Jay and Silent Bob sit in the back seat, huddled close together, their eyes glued on the Nun.
C: NUN
D: You both don't have to sit back there. One of you can sit up here with me.
N: Silent Bob shakes his head "no" to Jay. Jay shrugs and climbs up front.
C: NUN
D: So where are you boys from?
C: JAY
D: New Jersey.
C: NUN
D: What brings you to Indiana?
C: JAY
D: We're going to Hollywood.
C: NUN
D: Hollywood, hunh? That's a long ways away.
C: JAY
D: Yeah--we're lucky you picked us up.
C: NUN
D: Well, do unto others. That's what the Book says.
C: JAY
D: Wait a minute--you follow the Book, too?
E: misinterpreting completely
C: NUN
D: I live my life by it.
C: JAY
D: Really? You?
C: NUN
D: Of course. You know how lonely it gets on the road? Thanks to the Book, I'm never alone--if you know what I mean.
C: JAY
D: I guess. This guy back there explained it to us. But I didn't think you'd be into that.
C: NUN
D: Are you kidding? I've dedicated my life to it. Every hour of every day.
C: JAY
D: Shit--you nuns are alright.
C: NUN
D: You live by the Book, too?
C: JAY
D: You picked us up, didn't you? I gotta.
C: NUN
D: That's good to hear. But it takes deed, not words. It's a lot easier to say you live by the Book than to actually do it. Can you do it?
E: looks at him
C: JAY
D: You want me to do it right now?
C: NUN
D: No time like the present, right?
N: Jay looks back at Silent Bob. Silent Bob shakes his head "no." Jay shrugs them flips his hair over his shoulder, and starts to bend down.
C: JAY
D: Alright. You hear that? She's not a Catholic. She's a Presbyterian.
E: he suddenly stops
N: Jay disappears below the dash, The Nun goes wide-eyed.
S: EXT. ROADSIDE--DAY
N: The Nun's car screeched to the side of the road. Jay gets kicked our of the front seat by the screaming Nun. Silent Bob rushes out too, and the car races off. Jay's wipes his mouth. He pulls a long curly hair from between his teeth.
C: JAY
D: Dude--she had seventies bush.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY--NIGHT
N: Jay and Bob continue hitching.
C: JAY
D: I can't believe this shit. Five hours and not a single ride. Every day, millions of people hitch to Hollywood and stop studios from making movies about 'em. But when you and me try it, it's like we're trapped in a fucking cartoon!
N: A familiar-looking VAN pulls up in the other side of the raid, The horn beeps. Jay and Bob look at each other, shrug, and race across the street, get in. The van pulls off.
S: INT. VAN--NIGHT
N: Jay and Bob sit in the back of the can and stare at-- A clean-cut GUY, a Bookish woman in glasses, a red headed Beauty, a stoner DUDE, and a GREAT DANE. Jay looks at Silent Bob.
C: JAY
D: Zoinks, yo
C: GUY
D: And now we can finally solve the mystery of the Hitchhiking Ghouls! Pull off their masks and let's see who they really are!
C: BOOKISH
D: I don't think they are masks.
C: BEAUTY
D: I don't think they're Hitchhiking Girls either.
C: BOOKISH
D: Ghouls, you fucking moron. Not Girls. Though I wish they were hitchhiking girls. Sexy, skimpily clad hitchhiking girls--
E: to herself
C: GUY
D: Let's kick them out. We've got a mystery to solve.
C: DUDE
D: The only mystery here is why we take our cues from a dick in a neckerchief!
C: GUY
D: Keep it up, Beatnik! I'll feed you to the fucking dog!
C: BEAUTY
D: I CAN'T TAKE ALL THIS FIGHTING!
E: covering her ears; shrieking
C: JAY
D: YO!
N: The Gang look to Jay and Bob.
C: JAY
D: Youse guys need to turn those frowns upside down! And we got just the thing for that. We call them Doobie Snax.
E: pulls out a bag of joints
S: INT. VAN--WEED VISION
N: As Jay and Bob toke up, we go all SLO-MO and 70's freaky (with the image seeming to SWIM). Through their stoned haze, we see old-school witches, skeletons, and ghouls swirling about their heads--the latter of which gets his mask taken off to reveal a man inside a costume. Jay and Bob look at the gang, then take a hit off their joint and look back. Suddenly, the gang's engaged in total debauchery: the Dude rides the windshield while the Guy cackles insanely, blindfolded by his neckerchief. Bookish and Beauty are in their underwear, making out with each other. The Great Dane looks at Jay and Bob and says--
C: GREAT DANE
D: Ri, Ray rand Rirent Rob
N: The Great Dane rolls over, revealing its RED THING sticking way out of its sheath. It's monstrous. Jay and Bob go wide- eyed.
C: JAY
D: Look at his fuckin' lipstick!!! He's got a stoner-boner!!!
N: Jay and Bob smile and pass out. We cut back to the gang, who now appear as they did prior to Weed-Vision. They stare at the O.C. Jay and Bob.
C: BEAUTY
D: I think they passed out.
C: GUY
D: Great. What do we do with them now?
C: DUDE
D: Let's cut out their kidneys to sell on the black market and leave them in a seedy motel bathtub full of ice.
C: BOOKISH
D: Oh God, not again?
S: INT. SEEDY MOTEL BATHROOM--NIGHT
N: Jay lies in a bathtub full of ice, screaming. There's a scar on his back.
S: EXT. KANSAS CITY PARK--DAY
N: Jay wakes up suddenly, screaming. He startles Bob awake as well, as he clutched at this back lifting his shirt to see the scar. It's not there.
C: JAY
D: Holy shit, I had a horrible dream. Yo, I'm hungry. Where can we get some breakfast?
E: looks around
N: Bob looks around, and then locks on something O.C. He points, and Jay looks, smiles widely, and nods.
S: EXT. MOOBY'S FAST FOOD JOINT--DAY
N: An ESTABLISHING SHOT of the fast food eatery, as Jay and Bob enter.
S: INT. MOOBY'S FAST FOOD JOINT--SAME
N: As the pair head for the counter, Jay notices a public INTERNET TERMINAL. He tugs at Silent Bob's arm.
C: JAY
D: Yo--check that shit out: the Internet. Let's see if those fucks said something new about us and that stupid flick.
N: Bob shrugs, heading for the terminal. He inserts a dollar and types, following it up with a mouse click. The pair look at the screen and go wide-eyed.
C: JAY
D: "Any movie based on Jay and Silent Bob is gonna lick balls, because they both, in fact, lick balls. Namely each other's."
N: Jay and Silent Bob look at each other, wide-eyed.
C: JAY
D: Eww. "Yes--they are real people. Real stupid people. Signed, Darth Randal." Motherfucker! It's time we wrote something back! Type this shit down.
E: reading further to Bob
N: Silent Bob starts typing as Jay dictates.
C: JAY
D: All you motherfuckers are gonna pay. You are the ones who are the ball- lickers. We're gonna fuck your mothers whole you watch and cry like little bitches. Once we get to Hollywood and find those Miramax fucks who are making the movie, we're gonna make 'em eat our shit, then shit our shit, then eat their shit which is made of our shit that we made 'em eat. Then all you motherfuckers are next. Love, Jay and Silent Bob.
N: Silent Bob finishes typing and presses "Return". He and Jay nod at each other, then head over to the counter line, looking up at the menu board.
C: JAY
D: That'll fucking show 'em. Now we eat our Egga-Mooby-Muffins, then get back on the road, get to Hollywood, and stop that fucking movie from getting made. No more hairy-bush nuns, no more dogs. We keep our eye on the prize, and not let nothing-- and I mean NOTHING--distract me.
N: As Jay finishes speaking, he looks to the O.C. doors and freezes. A gorgeous GIRL walks through the front doors, all in SLO-MO to the tune of Prince's The Most Beautiful Girl in the World. She's bathed in light, glowing. She bats her eyelashes, gliding toward us. Jay is mouth-agape wide eyed. Silent Bob looks at him, then at the O.C.Girl. He slowly waves his hand in front of Jay's eyes, getting zero response. JAY'S POV The Girl smiles at us. His POV goes from her face, down to her breasts, then down to her crotch. Jay moves past Silent Bob and meets the Girl in the middle of the floor. He embraces her and lands a long, sweet kiss on her mouth. After a beat, he starts fumbling like a teenager to get to second base under her shirt, totally incongruous with the music. The Girl kindly tries to deter him. But it's just a fantasy. Jay's still standing there next to Silent Bob, but he is sporting a huge BONER. Silent Bob rolls his eyes. He grabs a soda cup off the counter and sticks it over Jay's boner, just as the Girl joins them in line. She smiles at the zombified Jay.
C: GIRL
D: Oh my God. Do you get free refills with that?
E: off cup
C: JAY
D: Oh, what--this? I just wear this for protection. You know--so no guys try to grab my shit.
C: GIRL
D: Hi. I'm Justice.
C: JAY
D: And I am so fucking yours--
E: dreamily
N: Silent Bob pokes Jay, who shakes of his daze.
C: JAY
D: I mean hi. I'm Jay. And this is my hereto life-mate, Silent Bob.
C: JUSTICE
D: It's nice to meet you.
C: JAY
D: Justice, hunh? That's a nice name. Jay'n'Justice, sitting in a tree. F-
E: under his breath, to Bob
C: U-C-K-I-N-G--
D: So you come here often?
E: back to Justice
C: JUSTICE
D: Oh, I'm not from around here. My friends and I are taking a road trip, and we just stopped to grab something to eat.
C: JAY
D: Your friends, hunh? Where they at?
C: JUSTICE
D: Out there. By that van.
E: pointing
N: Jay and Bob look past Justice to see a VAN with three other gorgeous GIRLS stretching outside of it, throwing their hair around, looking incredibly sexy. Without looking at Silent Bob, Jay quietly says to him--
C: JAY
D: Dude--I think I just filled the cup.
S: INT. VAN--DAY
N: Jay and Bob climb into the can, getting odd looks from the other Girls, Justice follows them in, tossing the fast food to her friends.
C: JAY
D: Ladies, ladies, ladies! Jay and Silent Bob are in the Hizz-ouse!!!
C: SISSY
D: Who the fuck are these guys?
C: JUSTICE
D: This is Jay and Silent Bob. Guys, this is Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy.
E: to Jay and Bob
C: CHRISSY
D: Where the fuck did they come from?
C: JUSTICE
D: I met 'em inside. They're gonna hitch a ride.
C: SISSY
D: I don't know if that's such a great idea. Jussy.
C: JAY
D: Sure it is, Juggs.
C: MISSY
D: Oh my god--he just called Sissy "Juggs"!
C: CHRISSY
D: I'm on it.
N: Chrissy lunges toward Jay, pulling a knife.
C: JUSTICE
D: Chrissy, no!
N: Sissy stops Chrissy, shoving a burger into her hands.
C: SISSY
D: We're in the middle of suburbia, Chrissy. Let's try to act like it.
C: CHRISSY
D: And what-stupid ass little foul- mouthed bitch-boys don't get their balls cut off in suburbia?
C: JAY
D: What's with the knife? We having cake or something?
E: oblivious
C: CHRISSY
D: Holy shit--he's retarded, to boot.
C: JAY
D: Yo--she called you retarded.
E: to Silent Bob
C: SISSY
D: What's wrong with you, Justice? You do remember where we're going, don't you?
E: to Justice
C: MISSY
D: That we do have a job to do?
C: JUSTICE
D: They're just gonna tag along for a few miles. They won't get in the way, I promise. Please?
E: cutesy
C: SISSY
D: Fine--they can ride with us. But they're so out of here before we get to Boulder.
C: JUSTICE
D: Honest Injun.
C: CHRISSY
D: "Honest Injun"? I can't believe what a pushover you are.
E: to Sissy
C: JAY
D: And I can't believe fine-ass bitches like yourselves eat that shit. Don't you know fast food makes girls fart?
N: Suddenly, Jay and Bob are parted by BRENT, who's getting into the van.
C: BRENT
D: Say--what's all this talk about farting?
N: Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy immediately go from disgusted to sweet and airy, totally switching characters.
C: SISSY/CHRISSY/MISSY
D: Hi Brent!
C: SISSY
D: This is Brent. He's with us, too.
C: CHRISSY
D: Brent, tell these sillies that girls don't fart.
C: BRENT
D: Of course they don't! Only skeevy stoners fart.
N: The very white Brent puts his hand out to be slapped by Jay and Silent Bob.
C: BRENT
D: What up, homies? Wow, Three guys, four girls-- What's the count boys?
E: off the Girls to Jay and Bob
N: Jay and Bob look at each other and roll their eyes.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY
N: The van drives down the road. We hear singing from inside.
S: INT. VAN--DAY
N: Brent strums a guitar and sings, as the Girls and Jay and Bob listen, rolling eyes.
C: BRENT
D: Hey there mister science-guy. Don't spray that aerosol in my eye. For I don't really want to die. I'm a noble rabbit!
C: JAY
D: What're you guys, like a cover band or something?
C: SISSY
D: We're the Kansas State chapter of S.A.A.C.--Students Against Animal Cruelty.
C: CHRISSY
D: And we're on our way to Colorado to give Provasik a piece of our minds!
N: Everyone lets out a whoop, except Jay and Bob.
C: JAY
D: What the fuck are you bitches babbling about?
C: BRENT
D: Hey! Watch the language little boy. There are females present.
N: Jay and Silent Bob eyeball Brent, until Justice distracts them.
C: JUSTICE
D: Provasik Pharmaceuticals is a medical lab where they perform gross experiments on animals.
C: JAY
D: So, what kind of animals are we talking about here--like bears and rhinos?
C: BRENT
D: No--more like rabbits, dogs, cats... heck, even monkeys, If we don't speak for them, who will? Right, Jussy?
E: touches Justice's arm
N: Jay sees this and his eyes flare over the competition. After a beat, he relaxes.
C: JAY
D: Hey, uh--Brent? Can I talk to you over here for a second?
N: Brent joins Jay, strumming his guitar. Jay addresses him confidentially.
C: JAY
D: Be honest, yo--you're down with this for the fine-ass pussy, right?
C: BRENT
D: I'm down with this because I love animals, stupid.
C: JAY
D: Even sheep?
C: BRENT
D: Of course. Sheep are beautiful creatures.
C: JAY
D: They are beautiful, aren't they?
C: BRENT
D: Oh God, yes.
C: JAY
D: So then you'd fuck a sheep?
C: BRENT
D: What is your damage little boy? You've got a sick and twisted world perspective.
C: JAY
D: No, you misunderstand me, Prince Valiant. I mean if you were another sheep. Would you fuck a sheep if you were another sheep?
C: BRENT
D: I--suppose so.
C: JAY
D: That's what I thought. YO! THIS MOTHERFUCKER AIN'T ONE OF US! HE JUST SAID HE'D FUCK A SHEEP!
E: suddenly loudly, to all
S: EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY
N: The side door of the van slides open and Brent gets hurled out of the moving vehicle. Jay throws his guitar at him as well, yelling and flipping the bird as the van drives off.
C: JAY
D: YA DIRTY SHEEP FUCKER!!!
S: EXT. HIGHWAY--LATER
N: The van drives down the road.
S: INT. VAN--SAME
N: Missy drives. Sissy sits in the passenger seat. Chrissy kneels between them.
C: CHRISSY
D: What the fuck are we gonna do now?
C: SISSY
D: Shut up, I'm thinking.
N: In the back, Justice studies some blueprints. Jay joins her, and she quickly folds them up.
C: JAY
D: Is Hollywood near where we're going?
C: JUSTICE
D: Is that where you guys are from?
C: JAY
D: Ch'yeah, right. Jersey represent!
C: JUSTICE
D: Oh, a Jersey Boy. What brings you all the way out here?
C: JAY
D: Well, we couldn't hang in front of the Quick Stop no more, 'cause of the strainen-en order, which sucks ass 'cause it's been like our home since we were kids. Silent Bob even busted his cherry there.
C: JUSTICE
D: You did? I'll bet she was a lucky girl.
E: to Bob
N: Bob blushes, Jay doesn't like that Justice's attention has strayed.
C: JAY
D: Look, fuck that fat fuck--I'm trying to tell a story here.
C: JUSTICE
D: Sorry.
C: JAY
D: Anyway, we were talking to Brodie and he said there's gonna be a Bluntman and Chronic movie. So we went to see Holden McNeil, and he showed us the Internet, and that's where we found all these fucking little jerkoffs were saying shit about us. So we decided to go to Hollywood and stop the movie from getting made. And now we're here.
C: JUSTICE
D: Wow. I have no idea what you just said.
C: JAY
D: Yeah, I get that a lot. So you like animals, huh?
C: JUSTICE
D: Sure.
C: JAY
D: That's cool. Even snakes?
C: JUSTICE
D: You can't exclude an animal just because it's not cuddly. Of course I like snakes.
C: JAY
D: How about trouser snakes?
C: JUSTICE
D: What's a trouser snake?
N: Just then, a little JAY DEVIL appears on Jay's left shoulder.
C: JAY DEVIL
D: What the fuck are you waiting for? She went for the setup! Reach in your fucking pants, and pull yer cock out, bitch! That's the kinda shit girls like!
E: to Jay
N: Suddenly another little JAY DEVIL appears in Jay's right shoulder. JAY DEVIL 2 Right about here's where the angel's supposed to show up and tell you not to pull your dick out. But we bitch- slapped that little fuck and sent him packing, so it's smooth sailing. Let 'er rip, boy! They disappear in little puffs of smoke and Jay shoves his hand down his pants, getting ready to whip out his dick, when suddenly a little JAY ANGEL appears on his shoulder, rubbing a swollen jaw.
C: JAY ANGEL
D: Sorry I'm late. So what's the deal here? Oh, shit--you're not thinking of whipping your dick out at this fine piece of woman, are you?
E: looks down
N: Jay thinks, then nods "Yes." The Jay Angel rolls his eyes, and slaps him.
C: JAY ANGEL
D: Tell you what: look at Silent Bob. See if he thinks it's a good idea to whip your dick out.
N: Jay looks to Silent Bob. Silent Bob looks from Jay's hand in his pants to Jay and shakes his head "no," sternly. Jay withdraws his hand from his pants. The Jay Angel nods, satisfied.
C: JAY ANGEL
D: That's it, boy--put the dick down. You gotta go from the heart, yo. No little perv bullshit will do for this one. Be smooth. Be Don Juan de la Nootch. Now I gotta go beat the shit out of two suckerpunching little bitches. Remember--don't pull your dick out until she asks you to. Or until she sleeping. Bunnnnggg! The Jay Angel blinks away. Justice looks at Jay, a bit confused.
E: beat
C: JAY
D: Don't ask. So, uh--what can a pimp-daddy like me do to help the animals?
E: beat
C: JUSTICE
D: You really don't want to help us--
C: JAY
D: What the fuck are you talking about? Sure I do. I'd do anything for you.
N: Justice smiles. Jay tries to recover.
C: JAY
D: I mean, youse guys! I'd do anything for youse guys. For the lift and shit.
C: JUSTICE
D: You sure?
C: JAY
D: Sure, I'm sure. I said it, didn't I. Fuck
C: JUSTICE
D: Well--okay. Let me talk it over with the other girls and get back to you.
C: JAY
D: You do that.
N: Jay takes Justice's hand and kisses it.
C: JAY
D: I'll be right here.
N: He winks at her, smiles and moves to the other side of the can, near Silent Bob. He's still smiling at Justice and winking when he looks to Silent Bob who stares at him blankly, then imitates Jay's hand-kissing back at him, Jay scowls.
C: JAY
D: Fuck you. Fatty.
S: EXT. CONVENIENCE STORY--DAY
N: The van pulls up and all pile out, stretching. The Girls head toward the store. Justice calls over to Jay and Silent Bob.
C: JUSTICE
D: You guys want anything from inside?
C: JAY
D: No, we're cool, thanks hon.
N: Justice smiles and heads inside. Jay and Silent Bob study the front of the foreign convenience store. They look for a place to lean, try a few spots out, then settle into one. After a beat--
C: JAY
D: It just ain't the same, is it? This place licks balls compared to Quick Stop.
N: Silent Bob shakes his head "Yeah."
C: JAY
D: And speaking of licking balls--how 'bout that Justice chick? She is too fine. And she smells so fucking pretty. She's got a nice voice, too. And that body? Smoking. You know, she never once said "fuck off," when I was talking to her, or pulled out the pepper spray, or nothing. I tell ya, Lunchbox--she could be the one.
S: INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY
N: Justice is at the microwave when she's suddenly surrounded by the other girls.
C: MISSY
D: Smooth move, Justice.
C: CHRISSY
D: Nice going, Four Eyes!
E: slapping Justice upside the head
C: JUSTICE
D: Ow!
C: SISSY
D: Why the fuck did you let that little stoner throw Brent our of the van?!
C: JUSTICE
D: Oh please--if I had to listen to one more of those stupid songs, I was going to throw him out myself.
C: SISSY
D: We needed Brent, Justice! He was our patsy!
C: JUSTICE
D: We'll find someone else. Besides, I didn't see you trying to stop Jay from throwing him out.
C: SISSY
D: Because I didn't want to blow our cover!
C: JUSTICE
D: Cover, shmover--you all hated his songs, too.
C: CHRISSY
D: Not as much as I hate you.
N: Justice offers Chrissy a cold glance,
C: CHRISSY
D: Fuck, if I don't get to kill someone soon, I'm gonna--fucking kill someone!
C: SISSY
D: Don't mind Chrissy. She's just a little too wound for sound.
E: rubbing Chrissy's shoulders
C: CHRISSY
D: Then how about you help me take the edge off?
N: Chrissy grabs Missy forcefully and the pair make out, hot and heavy in the middle of the convenience store. Other customers regard them wide-eyed.
C: JUSTICE
D: They're really good friends.
E: to Customers
C: SISSY
D: Would you two knock it off? We're in the fucking heartland here! Try to blend!
E: TO CHRISSY AND MISSY
C: JUSTICE
D: They already do--she's the milkmaid, and she's the cow.
C: CHRISSY
D: Oh, I'm a cow, am I? I'm a mad cow, bitch. And now I'm gonna rip your head off and fuck your spine stump.
C: SISSY
D: Enough! We have a very simple gang here, Justice. I'm the brains, Chrissy's the brawn, and Missy's the tech-girl. But lately, I'm having a hard time figuring out what you're doing here.
E: calm to Justice
C: JUSTICE
D: That makes two of us.
C: CHRISSY
D: Shit--your name doesn't even fit the rhyme scheme.
C: JUSTICE
D: That's because very few names rhyme with "douchebag."
C: CHRISSY
D: You're dancing on my last nerve, Strawberry Shortcake. You deal with the weak link. I'm gonna take Missy into the dirty convenience store bathroom and hate- fuck the shit out of her.
E: getting in her face to Sissy
N: Chrissy drags Missy off. Justice and Sissy watch them go.
C: JUSTICE
D: And you said letting them read all that Anais Nin wouldn't amount to anything.
C: SISSY
D: Don't change the subject. You know what you have to do now, right? Since you let our patsy slip away, you've gotta convince the little kid and that fat guy to take his place. They've gotta break into Provasik now.
C: JUSTICE
D: Uh-uh!
C: SISSY
D: Uh-huh. You'll do it; or you're out of this gang. Just use the little one's crush to convince him, since he's so fucking in love with you.
C: JUSTICE
D: Jay? No he's not.
C: SISSY
D: What--am I blind? He wasn't kissing your hand back in the van like he was fucking Lord Byron?
C: JUSTICE
D: Well, maybe he was just raised with manners.
S: EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY
N: A GIRL walks past Jay and Bob, heading out of the store.
C: JAY
D: YO, BABY! YOU EVER HAVE YOUR ASSHOLE LICKED BY A FAT MAN IN AN OVERCOAT?! Yeah.
E: to exited Girl to Bob
S: INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY
N: Sissy continues to confront Justice.
C: SISSY
D: You're the one that brought the kid in, Jussy. So you've gotta make amends.
C: JUSTICE
D: Jay is not taking Brent's place as the patsy.
C: SISSY
D: That kid and his quite friend are our only options at this point. Now we got about two hours before we get to Boulder. That gives you plenty of of time to work on him.
C: JUSTICE
D: I'm not gonna do it.
C: SISSY
D: Why the fuck not?
C: JUSTICE
D: Because he's just to so innocent!
N: Justice looks out the window and smiles, seeing Jay dancing alongside Bob.
C: JUSTICE
D: Look at him--
S: EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE--SAME
N: Jay's dancing still, but now we hear what he's SINGING to Silent Bob.
C: JAY
D: I'm gonna finger-fuck her tight little asshole! Finger-bang and tea-bang my balls--in her mouth! Where? Where? In her mouth--balls-a-plenty in her mouth! Balls, balls, sweaty balls--
S: INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--SAME
N: Sissy eyeballs Justice, who's still looking out at Jay.
C: SISSY
D: Who's it going to be, Jussy--him or us?
N: Justice looks at Sissy. Sissy nods at her. Justice looks back out at Jay.
S: INT. VAN--DAY
N: Justice talks to Jay and Silent Bob.
C: JAY
D: Steal a monkey? Shit--no problem.
C: JUSTICE
D: It's not really stealing--it's liberating it, and-- Wait a second--did you say, "No problem"?
E: finally hears him
C: JAY
D: Yeah, Fuck--we steal monkeys all the time. Right, Lunchbox?
E: to Bob
N: Silent Bob glares at Jay.
C: JUSTICE
D: It's not like it's a bad thing. It's for a good cause.
C: JAY
D: Oh, it for the best cause, mon cheri-- The cause of love. Snoogans--
E: takes her hand kisses her hand, then releases
C: JUSTICE
D: What the heck is that?
C: JAY
D: What's what?
C: JUSTICE
D: "Snoogans," I believe it was.
C: JAY
D: What the fuck do you think it means? It means "I'm kidding."
C: JUSTICE
D: Ohhh. Well, that's too bad.
N: She smiles at Jay, touches his chin and heads to the front of the van. Jay plays it cool until she's out of sight, then humps silent Bob's leg like a dog.
C: JAY
D: I can't believe I'm gonna get some pussy for stealing a monkey! If I'd known it was that easy, I'd've been stealing monkeys since I was like seven and shit.
E: singing speaking
N: Jay looks at Silent Bob, who clearly disapproves.
C: JAY
D: Don't, motherfucker. Don't you ruin this for me. Me and Justice are gonna get married one day, so don't be giving me that "we-ain't-stealing-no- monkey" look. I'm Morris Day; you're Jerome, bitch. Don't forget that. That girl? That girl's in love with me.
N: Up front, Justice talks to Sissy, while Missy drives.
C: JUSTICE
D: They're gonna do it.
C: SISSY
D: Good. They do their part-- And we'll do ours.
E: pats a video camera
N: Justice eyes Sissy, then slumps in her seat.
S: EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT
N: The Van rolls up across the street from the Provasik Labs, parking in front of another large building.
S: INT. VAN--SAME
N: Jay and Silent bob get out, along with Justice. They wear Ninja masks. Missy and Chrissy follow.
C: JUSTICE
D: Remember--we meet back here when you're done. You sure you're okay with this?
C: JAY
D: As sure as I am that you're the hottest bitch I ever seen.
N: Chrissy lunges at Jay, Missy holds her back, dragging Chrissy away.
C: JAY
D: What's twisting that bitch's tits?
C: JUSTICE
D: Maybe it's because women don't like to be called "bitches," Jay.
C: JAY
D: They don't? Well how 'bout "piece of ass"?
C: JUSTICE
D: How about not.
C: JAY
D: Well, what the fuck am I supposed to call you, then?
C: JUSTICE
D: Something sweet, you big goof. Something nice.
C: JAY
D: Boo-boo kitty fuck.
E: thinks; then
C: JUSTICE
D: Okay. That's a start.
E: laughing
N: Sissy jumps out of the van, holding the video camera, aiming it at Jay and Bob.
C: SISSY
D: Jay, before you go, could you say something into the camera about the clitoris.
C: JAY
D: What?
C: JUSTICE
D: Man you are such a bitch--
E: to Sissy
C: SISSY
D: She's just a little embarrassed. See, Jussy and I are putting together this documentary for our Human Sexuality class, and we need a male perspective on the clitoris.
E: off Justice; to Jay
C: JAY
D: The female clitoris?
C: SISSY
D: Uh--yeah.
C: JUSTICE
D: Jay, you don't have to do this.
N: She elbows Sissy.
C: JAY
D: Nah, it's cool, hon. There's a few things I can say about the clit that I's like you to hear. I am the master of the clit! I make that shit work! It does what ever the fuck I tell it to do! No one rules the clit like me! Not this little fuck! None of you little fucks out there! I am the clit commander!!! Remember that-- commander of all clits!
E: clears throat; into camera off Silent Bob
N: Jay proceeds to make some pussy-eating faces. Justice shakes her head at Sissy, who snaps the camera closed and smiles.
C: SISSY
D: Awesome. Knock 'em dead, Tiger.
N: Sissy climbs back into the van.
C: JAY
D: So--can I get a little kiss for good luck?
E: to Justice
N: Justice smiles at Jay, then kisses him sweetly on the lips.
C: JAY
D: So--can I get a little blow job for good luck?
N: Justice smiles and pulls Jay's mask down. He heads off, revealing Silent Bob behind him, lips puckered, handing in midair. Jay reached back into the frame, pulling Bob out. Justice watches them go.
C: SISSY
D: Jussy. C'mon.
N: Justice climbs back into the van.
S: INT. VAN--SAME
N: Justice sits, glaring at Sissy.
C: SISSY
D: Hey, Lover-girl. You cock-block my authority again, you lose your fucking fronts, you got that?
C: JUSTICE
D: Yes, sir.
N: Sissy takes the tape out of the camera and hands it off to Missy, beside whom is a bag full of high-tech equipment.
C: SISSY
D: Phase One, down. While we're executing Phase Two, you edit that tape and grab a new car.
C: MISSY
D: No sweat.
C: SISSY
D: Let's suit up.
S: EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT
N: Jay and Silent bob tuck-and-roll across the front lawn, stopping at the building. Silent Bob pulls a GRAPPLING GUN out of his coat. He fires it into the air as Jay quickly gives the "metal" sign, and the pair are lifted out-of-frame.
S: INT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT
N: It's dead quiet and still. Then, the pair smash through a window, landing in the floor in a ball. They lift their Ninja hoods. Jay glares at Silent Bob.
C: JAY
D: You fat fuck--
S: INT. VAN--NIGHT
N: Missy peers through binoculars out the window.
C: SISSY
D: They in?
C: MISSY
D: You can say that.
C: SISSY
D: Time to shine. Let's go.
S: EXT. VAN--NIGHT
N: The quartet piles out of the van, and we get our first look at them: sexily geared up for action, wearing all black. They head for a SEPARATE BUILDING. Stopping at the front door. Sissy gestures elaborately to Missy, and Missy gestures elaborately back, racing away into the night. Justice offers Sissy a look.
C: JUSTICE
D: You are so gay.
N: Chrissy sticks a box on the door and presses a button. On a digital readout, numbers roll until they stop on four different digits. The door lock CLICKS open.
C: SISSY
D: Once we're inside, I want complete silence. Missy whipped this up. It counts our decibel level. If it goes into the red--alarm, we're dead. So not even the slightest noise, got it?
E: holding up high-tech device
N: Justice blows her off. Sissy enters the building, followed closely by Chrissy. Justice lingers at the door, taking one last look back at the Provasik Building, fretting for Jay and Bob.
C: SISSY
D: Justice! Move your ass!
E: pokes her head back out
N: Justice heads inside. We PAN up to reveal a sign that reads: BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE.
S: INT. PROVASIK TESTING ROOM--NIGHT
N: Jay and Bob stand there, looking around the room. It's lines with cages, all of which contain sad-looking ANIMALS. A tear forms in silent Bob's eye. Jay rolls his eyes and hits him.
C: JAY
D: Stay frosty, you big fucking softie. We've got a job to do.
N: Silent Bob nods and clicks on a flashlight. The pair wade through the cages. Jay stops at an EMERGENCY BOX hanging on the wall. Inside it, there's a pistol.
C: JAY
D: Check this out, Lunchbox. Animal tranquilizer. This shit fucks you up like Percocets!
N: Jay elbows the glass, breaking it. He takes the gun out and tosses it to Bob.
C: JAY
D: Hold this. Later, me and Justice can shoot each other with it and fuck like stoned test bunnies. Bunnggg.
N: Silent Bob rolls he eyes and sticks the gun in his coat. The pair look through the cages, until HEAR the distinct SOUND OF A MONKEY. Jay directs Silent Bob's flashlight to the cage from where the sound emitted. He smiles.
C: JAY
D: "Suzanne." Boo-yah.
E: reading
S: INT. BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE--NIGHT
N: The three Girls stand at the end of a large hallway. At the other end is a glass case, full of DIAMONDS. Sissy pulls and aerosol can from her utility belt and sprays the air in the hallway. She watches the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly at the sound of the spray. Suddenly, within the mist, laser beams become apparent. Sissy hands the decibel monitor to Chrissy and takes a few steps back, shaking her hands to limber up. She then runs forward and does an impressive series of flips down the hallway, not touching a single laser beam. Chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly. Once Sissy's flipping comes to a stop at the other end of the hallway near the Diamond case, she makes a hand gesture to Justice. Justice nods, and proceeds to do the same series of flips down the hallway, not tripping the alarm. Chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly. Justice lands beside Sissy, and then Sissy gestures to Chrissy. Chrissy tosses the decibel monitor over the laser beams, Sissy catches it, and the monitor rises only slightly. Then, Chrissy proceeds with her series of flips, which are even more impressive than the other two, including running up walls and pushing into handstand flips. When she passes the last laser beam, she lands between Sissy and Justice, arms in the air like a gymnast. Then, she lets out a loud, manly FART. The decibel monitor goes red and an alarm starts RINGING through the building.
C: CHRISSY
D: Holy fuck--the little stoner was right--
N: Sissy shutters the glass surrounding the Diamonds. She ours them into a bag, and races back down the hallway, followed by Justice and Chrissy.
S: EXT. BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE--NIGHT
N: The Girls emerge from the Diamond Exchange, just as Missy pulls up in a CONVERTIBLE.
C: CHRISSY
D: Boom Box!
N: Missy tosses a metal box to Chrissy, who catches it and races toward the van, while Sissy and Justice pile into the convertible.
C: SISSY
D: I can't believe it. Months of planning and it's all blown by a fucking fart.
C: JUSTICE
D: We can't just leave them like this! That alarm's gonna bring the cops here any minute!
C: SISSY
D: That was always the plan, Justice! They take the heat off of is long enough until we can get out of town!
N: Chrissy attaches the metal box to the side of the van.
C: CHRISSY
D: Kaboom, you little stoner fucks.
N: The girls pull up in the convertible and Chrissy jumps into the car with them.
C: CHRISSY
D: It's set. Let's roll.
N: The convertible screeches away, leaving the can sitting there. The metal has magnetically attached to the side is counting down from two minutes.
S: INT. PROVASIK TESTING LAB--NIGHT
N: Jay and Bob carry a large canvas bag between them. Something seems to move inside it. The head for the exit, but Silent bob hesitates, offering a sad look to the animals in all the cages. Jay hits him.
C: JAY
D: What the fuck are you looking at? There ain't no snacks here, man! Now we got what we came for, so let's get the fuck out!
N: Silent Bob half-gestures to the cages, forlorn. Jay shakes his head frustrated.
C: JAY
D: Yeah, it's sad! But what the fuck are we supposed to do about it?
N: Silent bob offers Jay a look.
S: EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT
N: The front doors burst open, spilling out Jay, Silent Bob (carrying their bag), and HUNDREDS OF ANIMALS--cats, dogs, birds, rabbits. All race off into the night. Jay and Bob race toward the van. Jay screams at it.
C: JUSTICE
D: JUSTICE! OPEN THE DOORS!
N: Suddenly, Jay and Bob stop dead in their tracks.
C: JAY
D: Oh shit--
N: Three COP CARS screech up, the van between them and Jay and Bob. The COPS leap out of their cruisers, guns drawn. Jay looks to Bob, pissed
C: COP
D: DROP THE BAG! BEFORE THIS THING TURNS EXPLOSIVE!
N: The counter on the device attached to the van hits "0," and the van BLOWS UP. Jay and Bob get thrown backwards in one direction, the Cops in the other. On all fours, Jay looks at the burning shell of the van, a tear forming in his eye.
C: JAY
D: Justice--
N: We crane up from him as he bellows--
C: JAY
D: JUUUSSSTTTTIIIICCCCEEEE!!!!!!
N: Silent Bob grabs Jay and drags him out of frame, still carrying the bag.
S: EXT. FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL'S OFFICE--DAY
N: We start on a sign on the door that reads: Federal Wildlife Marshal, Colorado Field Office, then pull back to see a DEPUTY opening the door and heading inside.
S: INT. FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL'S OFFICE--DAY
N: The Deputy enters just as a FAX is coming through at an operations board. He rips it off, reading it. His eyes go wide.
C: DEPUTY
D: Oh, fudge... Marshal Willenholly!
E: calling off
S: INT. BATHROOM--SAME
N: MARSHAL WILLENHOLLY sits on the bowl, staring at Four Legged Law-Man magazine, eyeing it lustily. Below frame, he jerks off.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Yeah, you chug that ass-cock baby-- It takes two hands to hold doesn't it--? Uhhh--
N: As he climaxes, a ganging at the door disrupts him.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: WHAT?! WHAT?! I'M READING!
C: DEPUTY
D: Sir, we got a report of a break-in at Provasik Pharmaceuticals' testing lab.
E: O.S.
N: Willenholly emerges from the bathroom, holding the magazine. There's a massive wet spot on the front of his pants.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Have you read this article on the mule-suckers in Tijuana? Good God, I wish that was in our jurisdiction-- I'd shut down every last one of those ass-cock chuggers, personally.
N: The Deputy looks at the stain on Willenholly's pants, then at Willenholly.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: What? "Ass" means "donkey."
C: DEPUTY
D: Yes, sir.
E: hands him a fax
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Boulder, hunh? Well, gas up the jet.
E: looks at fax
C: DEPUTY
D: We don't have a jet, sir. And Boulder's only ten minutes away.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Then gas up the next best thing.
S: EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--DAY
N: There are FIRE TRUCKS all over the place now. The burned out van is being poured over by Cops. Just then, Willenholly pulls up on a MOPED. He parks it and surveys the wreckage.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: My, oh my, oh my. Who let the cats out? Wait--is that right?
E: thinks
N: COP 1 (O.S.) Excuse me--who the hell are you? Willenholly rips down the Velcro patch on his jacket, revealing a badge.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Federal Wildlife Marshal. This investigation is now under my jurisdiction.
N: COP 1 Oh really? And why is that?
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Because someone let a whole mess of animals out of their cages, sir.
N: COP 1 Well, we believe that was just a diversionary tactic used to call attention away from the real heist over here at the Diamond Exchange.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Yeah, right. That's a believable scenario. It sounds more like something out of a bad movie.
N: Willenholly and the Cop look at the camera. Then, another COP joins them. COP 2 Sir, the Provasik people say they've rounded all their animals up, except for one: an orangutan.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Listen up, ladies and gentlemen! Our fugitive has been on the run for 6 hours! Average simian foot speed over uneven ground--barring injuries or preoccupation with tire tubes, mites or bananas--is four miles an hour. That gives us a radius of twenty miles.
N: COP 3 (calling out from crowd) Twenty-four, sir!
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: What?
N: COP 3 Six hours times four miles an hour is twenty-four.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Yes. Yes, you're right. My bad. Twenty- four miles. Now what I want out of all of you is a hard target search.
E: doing the math in his head
N: COP 4 Excuse me, sir?
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Yeah?
N: COP 4 What does that mean, exactly--a "hard target search"? What's a "hard target"?
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Well. It's--a target--that's--hard. Anyway--
N: COP 4 So are you referring to the search's level of difficulty? Or is the hard target the monkey? COP 3 Or the people who stole the monkey? The COPS now chatter amongst themselves, to the effect of "Yeah--It could mean that too--He's got a point--,"etc. Willenholly rubs his temples.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Okay, how about this? What I want out of all of you is a thorough search of every gas station, residence, warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, outhouse, and doghouse in that area! Checkpoints go up at fifteen miles!
N: COP 1 Wouldn't it make sense to put them up at every twenty-four miles--seeing as that's how far they'd have gotten in the last six hours? They begin chattering amongst themselves again. Willenholly looks at them all, defeated. He starts to cry.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: This is so frustrating. It's just so hard sometimes-- YOUR FUGITIVE'S NAME IS SUZANNE! GO FIND HER!
E: yelling
N: Another COP joins Willenholly, carrying a large, fat envelope. COP 5 Sir, this was just delivered to the station.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: What is it?
N: COP 5 It's a tape from the terrorists who're claiming credit for the break-in.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Is it VHS or Beta? You know what-- never mind. Do you have a VCR?
S: INT. OFFICE--DAY
N: Willenholly and the Cops stare at the O.C. TV, shocked, as the video ends.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Oh my God-- Have the jet gassed up and ready to go at a moment's notice.
E: without looking up
C: COP
D: Sir, we don't have a jet; just a helicopter.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Doesn't anybody have a jet anymore? Plafsky? It is Willenholly. You gotta get me on the national news, pronto. Why?! Because we may very well be dealing with the two most dangerous men on the planet!
E: dialing his cell phone into cell phone
S: EXT. UTAH ROADSIDE--DAY
N: Jay and Silent Bob sit close to each other, staring at-- SUZANNE (the ORANGUTAN)--who sits on a log across from them, staring back.
C: JAY
D: This is Jussy's monkey JUSTICE DIED FOR YOU, YOU MONKEY FUCK!
E: to Suzanne, angrily
N: Suzanne covers her eyes with her hands suddenly. Jay and Silent Bob, startle, with Jay leaping behind Silent Bob and pulling back as if he's going to strike.
C: JAY
D: Do something. Tons of Fun!
E: to Silent Bob
N: Silent Bob offers the ape a weak wave. Suzanne drops her hands from her face and waves back. Jay cranes his neck to see over silent Bob.
C: JAY
D: Is that fucking thing waving at us?
N: Suzanne nods. Jay steps out from behind Bob. They state at the ape.
C: JAY
D: Holy shit? That monkey understood us! Maybe it's some sort of super- monkey!
N: Suzanne offer them a "raspberry." Spitting as if the comment was ridiculous. Jay and Silent Bob react with surprise at this.
C: JAY
D: What the fuck was that for? It's not a stupid idea! I seen it in Congo?
N: Suzanne holds her nose, as if to say, "Congo stunk." Silent Bob smiles in agreement and amusement. Jay looks at him, stung.
C: JAY
D: You're my bitch. You get my back. Don't go joining this chimp's side.
N: Jay looks around the woods, formulating a thought. Silent Bob moves toward the ape, extending his hand to shake hers.
C: JAY
D: Yo--what if there's more super monkeys up in the lab? Maybe they're making an army of 'em up there! Holy shit! Maybe it's a conspiracy--like on the X-Files Roswell--style!
N: JAY'S DELUSION: We enter into JAY'S HEAD and see--
S: INT. LAB--DAY
N: We PAN over from a chimp in a chemist's coat measuring liquids in a pair of beakers to a chimp at a drafting table sketching blueprints for an insidious war machine. An orangutan shakes hands with a group of five well-dressed men, one of which looks like the Cigarette Smoking Man from the X-Files.
C: JAY
D: Working in secret with a crew of double-dealing, nicotine-fiending fucks that're selling out the human race, these supermonkeys will use simian science and their genius IQ's to make man and monkey alike believe that they're the superior species!
E: V.O.
S: EXT. BALCONY--DAY
N: A monkey dressed like Mussolini addresses a huge crowd of apes, who wave fists in the air.
C: JAY
D: Then all it'll take is one little monkey in a spiffy suit to whip the dumber chimps into a frenzy, until they go all ape-shit and start demanding more bananas, better pay, and human flesh!
E: V.O.
S: EXT. FIELD--DAY
N: Randal leads a pack of humans racing through a cornfield, and is shot in the neck. He collapses, revealing a GORILLA on horseback holding a rifle. Two other Gorillas throw a net over him.
C: JAY
D: You'll have to be faster than Walt Flanagan's Dog to outrun the warrior gorillas, who hunt humans for sport, profit, and the occasional inter- species blow-job. And if you don't wind up with a monkey hog in your mouth, you'll be captured, killed or worse...
E: V.O.
S: INT. LAB--DAY
N: Cornelius and Zera-looking chimps dissect the brain of a living, screaming, Dante.
C: JAY
D: Eaten alive!
E: V.O.
S: EXT. QUICK STOP--DAY
N: The Quick Stop is overrun by vines in a jungle like atmosphere. Monkeys exit the store carrying bunches of bananas. The sign now reads: Ape Stop
C: JAY
D: Then these monkey fucks'll start wearing our clothes and rebuilding the world in their image.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. BEACH--DAY
N: We start on a FULL SHOT of Jay on the beach, looking up, then SNAP ZOOM OUT to REVEAL Jay kneeling before the beach buried Statue of Liberty, screaming, his arms raised.
C: JAY
D: And only those who outwit those damn dirty apes'll ever remember that it was MAN who once ruled the earth!
E: V.O.
C: JAY
D: YOU MANIACS! DAMN YOUSE!!! GODDAMN YOUSE ALL TO HELL!!!
E: at statue
N: WE DISSOLVE FROM THIS IMAGE TO:
S: EXT. UTAH ROADSIDE--DAY
N: Another close-up of Jay's painted face. Behind him, Suzanne and Silent Bob are playing patty-cake. Jay eyes Suzanne angrily.
C: JAY
D: Not on my watch, motherfucker!
N: Jay turns and rushes Suzanne, ferociously.
C: JAY
D: DIE, YOU SUPER-MONKEY FUCK! DIE!!!
N: Jay trips on a root poking out of the ground and hits the dirt. Suzanne then goes over to Jay, pulls his face to hers, and kisses him on the lips.
C: JAY
D: Alright--you can live. For now.
N: Silent Bob helps Jay to his feet.
C: JAY
D: You see that? Bitches love me. Besides--we're in the fucking clear, yo. It's not like anyone knows we stole the monkey.
E: heading off
S: INT. TV NEWS STATION--DAY
N: An ANCHORMAN addresses the camera.
C: ANCHORMAN
D: I'm Reg Hartner and this is a News Now bulletin. A Provasik animal testing facility in boulder was the focus of an attack by a terroristic primate rescue syndicate calling themselves the Coalition for Liberation of Itinerant Tree-Dwellers. Or simply, C.L.I.T.
N: A graphic of the C.L.I.T. logo appears beside him, nailing home the joke.
C: ANCHORMAN
D: In a videotape sent to authorities this morning, credit for the liberation of an orangutan from the lab last night is taken by these men--
N: A VIDEO CAPTURE of JAY and SILENT BOB from pre-break--in appears on screen.
C: ANCHORMAN
D: --identified in literature that accompanies the tape as Jay and Silent Bob. In this chilling clip, they make it very clear that they are in control of the C.L.I.T.
N: On screen is the C.L.I.T. Logo. A digitized voice narrates.
C: DIGITIZED VOICE
D: We are the C.L.I.T. None of you are safe. Now tremble before the might of our merciless leader.
N: The logo gives way to the video of Jay and Bob that Sissy shot before the Provasik break-in. Jay's yelling into the camera.
C: JAY
D: I AM THE CLIT COMMANDER!!!
N: Coming out of the video footage, the Anchorman shakes his head, chilled.
C: ANCHORMAN
D: Terrifying. Here to help us understand this footage is Federal Wildlife Marshal Willenholly.
N: PULL OUT to reveal Willenholly beside the Anchorman.
C: ANCHORMAN
D: Marshal, what can you tell us about the C.L.I.T.?
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: From the intelligence we've been able to gather, we've discovered that the C.L.I.T. is a tiny offshoot of the L.A.B.I.A.
C: ANCHORMAN
D: The Liberate Apes Before Imprisoning Apes movement.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Exactly. The men you saw in the video are believed to be the masterminds responsible for the frenzied C.L.I.T. activity last night. They go by the obvious code names "Jay" and "Silent Bob." If you should come across them or any other C.L.I.T.-ies, please-- exercise extreme caution.
E: to camera
S: INT. POTZEK'S INC. OFFICE--NIGHT
N: On the TV screen is Willenholly and the video capture of Jay and Silent Bob. Holden looks up from his drawing table, shocked.
C: ANCHORMAN
D: Marshal, how do you respond to allegations that Federal Wildlife Marshal's Office allowed the C.L.I.T. to slip through their fingers?
E: O.S. from TV
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Nonsense. We're all over the C.L.I.T., Reg.
E: O.S.
C: HOLDEN
D: Nights like this, I miss dating a lesbian.
E: shakes his head
S: INT. QUICK STOP--NIGHT
N: From behind the register, Dante and Randal stare at the TV, slack-jawed.
C: ANCHORMAN
D: Is there also speculation that Jay and Silent bob may be responsible for the Diamond Exchange jewel heist that occurred in the same vicinity of downtown Boulder last night?
E: O.S. from TV
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: There's nothing to suggest that, no. But these men are still to be considered very dangerous.
E: O.S.
C: RANDAL
D: I told you that restraining order was a good idea.
E: to Dante
S: EXT. SEEDY MOTEL ROOMS--SAME
N: On the second-floor terrace of a run-down, roadside motel, Sissy, Missy and Chrissy dance in their undies and drink champagne. On the first floor terrace below, Justice leans against the open sliding glass door, watching the news report on a TV inside the room with the volume turned way up.
C: ANCHORMAN
D: Is that your cell phone?
E: on TV
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Yes, Excuse me. Federal Wildlife Marshal. I'm on my way! We got 'em. They're in Utah. Citizens of Utah--steer clear of the C.L.I.T. Stimulation of the C.L.I.T. is not recommended.
E: on TV on TV, into cell phone shuts phone; to anchorman to camera
N: Justice turns the TV off and yells up to Sissy.
C: JUSTICE
D: Your tape worked. The news is all about Jay and Silent Bob's Provasik break-in, with almost no mention of the Diamond heist.
C: SISSY
D: I told you those two were the perfect patsies. Now we lay low for awhile-- just in case--and start planning the next job.
E: yelling down to Justice
C: JUSTICE
D: Don't you feel any regret? Jay and Bob don't deserve this. They were really sweet.
C: CHRISSY
D: The only thing I regret is not gutting that little trout-mouthed prick like a fish and playing Twister with his vitals.
C: MISSY
D: You are so nasty.
C: CHRISSY
D: I'll show you nasty, you little slut.
C: SISSY
D: Would you two get a room?
C: CHRISSY
D: Fine--we'll take yours. I am gonna stain your sheets, bi- otch.
E: getting up in Sissy's face
N: Chrissy dances away with Missy, heading inside. Sissy rolls her eyes.
C: SISSY
D: Sarah Lawrence girls. Go figure.
C: JUSTICE
D: They're your gang.
C: SISSY
D: Oh and not yours? You know, I don't get you, Justice. You used to be all about the girl stuff: stealing, boning, blowing shit up. Now you're like this little priss with a conscience. It's really a fucking drag.
C: JUSTICE
D: We all gotta grow up some time.
C: SISSY
D: If moping around over some little boy you're crushing on is being grown- up, then pass me my Wonder Woman underoos.
C: JUSTICE
D: Don't you feel the least bit of guilt for what we did to those guys?
C: SISSY
D: Awww. Does Jussy-wussy feel all dirty about setting up her boyfriend? Then how about taking a shower?
N: Sissy dumps the bag of diamonds over the side of the terrace. They rain down on Justice below. Just then a PIZZA DELIVERY GUY approaches the lower terrace, carrying a stack of pizzas.
C: PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
D: You the gals that ordered the pizzas?
C: SISSY
D: This dopey bitch ordered the large plain, but I could go for some hot, thick, Sicilian.
C: PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
D: No charge, lady. He rushes into the motel, Justice sighs, looking up at the stars.
C: JUSTICE
D: I'm sorry, Jay.
E: quietly
S: INT. DINER--DAY
N: Jay, Silent Bob, and Suzanne sit at a booth, eating. Jay chews a burger while Silent Bob eats pancakes and Suzanne digs into a banana split.
C: JAY
D: You know, Justice died trying to save this monkey, so maybe we should keep her around. That way, we can honor her memory.
N: Silent bob and Suzanne are oblivious, digging into their food.
C: JAY
D: Look at you Tubby Bitches. I'm waxing all sentimental, and you're all about a fucking meal and shit. Now ain't you glad we stopped to eat? And you were all piss-scared the cops'd bust us or something. You know what I say?
E: singing, a la NWA
C: VOICE
D: THIS IS THE UTAH STATE POLICE! WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR, AND SURRENDER THE ORANGUTAN!
E: O.S. via bullhorn
N: Jay and Bob freeze and go wild-eyed for a beat. Then--
C: JAY
D: You think they're talking to us?
S: EXT. DINER--DAY
N: There's a few COP CARS outside, and the SHERIFF is yelling at the diner through his bullhorn. Beside him are the other COPS.
C: SHERIFF
D: YOU HAVE SIXTY SECONDS TO COMPLY. Fuck it, Let's give 'em thirty.
E: to other COPS
N: Suddenly Willenholly rushes up, dramatically ducking behind the car, gun drawn.
C: SHERIFF
D: The ape.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: What?
C: SHERIFF
D: An orangutan's a member of the great ape family. It's not a monkey.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Look, who's the Federal Wildlife Marshal here? JAY AND SILENT BOB, THIS IS FEDERAL
E: into bullhorn
C: WILDLIFE MARSHAL WILLENHOLLY! YOUR
D: C.L.I.T. DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE.
C: SURRENDER THE MONKEY IMMEDIATELY,
D: AND YOU WON'T GET SHOT!
S: INT. DINER--DAY
N: Jay, Suzanne, and Silent Bob peer over the top of their booth, like scared rats.
C: JAY
D: What the fuck are you waiting for? Go out there and give 'em the monkey.
N: Silent Bob looks to Jay, shocked.
C: JAY
D: Oh, what, man? I said that shit before I knew they were gonna shoot us! Yes--Jussy was a hottie, but I ain't takin' no bullet for no monkey!
N: Bob pulls Suzanne close to him, welling up with tears. Jay rolls his eyes.
C: JAY
D: Oh, brother--this is like something out of fucking Benji! Look man, maybe it's not that bad back at the lab! Maybe they experiment on 'em by, like making 'em fuck a bunch of different, good-looking monkeys. We don't know! Maybe they got it real sweet!
N: Suzanne shakes her head "no." Bob points to her, as if she's strengthening his point.
C: JAY
D: You stay out of this, you weepy little chimp! Fuck man, I ain't no strategist! You're the guy that makes the blueprints! I don't even have the fucking smarts of a little--
E: to Suzanne looks around thinking
N: Jay's eyes fall on a scared FAMILY in a nearby booth. There's a little kid (around five or so), and he's wearing a hooded sweatshirt and a baseball cap.
C: JAY
D: --kid
S: EXT. DINER--DAY
N: Willenholly's on the bullhorn, yelling at the diner. The Sheriff looks on.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: ANYONE NOT HARBORING A FUGITIVE MONKEY BETTER HIT THE DECK! WE'RE GOING TO
C: OPEN FIRE!
D: Everyone has bullets in their guns, right?
E: to cops
N: Jay and Silent Bob emerge from the diner, with Suzanne between them (they're holding her raised hands). She's now dressed up in the sweatshirt and jeans the kid was wearing in the diner, with the baseball cap pulled down over her face. It's a pretty piss-poor disguise.
C: JAY
D: Don't shoot! We're just trying to take our son out of this hostile environment!
N: From behind the cop car, the Sheriff looks to Willenholly.
C: SHERIFF
D: Their "son"?
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Maybe they're one of those gay couples?
N: Jay seizes on the idea. Silent Bob nods fervently.
C: JAY
D: Yeah! We're gay! And this is our adopted love child! We're not from around here! Don't make us go back to our liberal city home with a tales of prejudice and bigotry in the heart of Utah! You see the shit I gotta put up with for you! Now I got this guy thinking I'm gay!
E: whispers to Bob
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Oh God, this is the last thing I need--a bunch of uppity homosexuals shooting their mouth off in the liberal press that the Federal Wildlife Marshal's Office persecutes gays.
C: SHERIFF
D: ARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY! THOSE TWO MAY BE GAY, BUT THAT AIN'T THEIR SON! THAT'S THE APE!
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: You see this badge? I think I'd recognize an ape if I saw one. And the only thing I do recognize here is a political fiasco I'm, going to avoid by letting this butt-fucking Brady Bunch go!
N: Jay is whispering to Silent Bob, still vexed by--
C: JAY
D: And I'll tell you another thing: what if that guy shows up around the stores one day and starts telling everybody you and me are poo-gilists? How are we gonna get any pussy then, hunh?
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: YOU ARE FREE TO LEAVE, SIRS!
E: V.O.
N: Jay and Silent Bob look at each other, shocked. They look back out at Willenholly, who's yards away. Jay points at himself, as if to say, "Me?"
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: YES, YOU, SIRS.
E: via bullhorn
C: JAY
D: So we can just go?
E: calling over
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Yes, sir--or ma'am. Please accept my apologies for detaining you and your unorthodox-but-constitutionally- protected-family unit.
E: via bullhorn
C: SHERIFF
D: Un-fucking believable.
E: amazed
C: JAY
D: I'd like to offer a big gay thank- you, sir. We'll tell all our gay friends that Utah is Gay friendly country for gays who are gay.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: I'm sure Utah appreciates that. You might also want to make it clear that the Federal Wildlife Marshal's Office is also pro-'mo as well. And might I add, that's one fine- looking boy you're raising.
E: winks at the sheriff
C: JAY
D: Well, that's 'cuz he's from my sperm. See, I knocked up a hot woman friend of ours who I also fuck on the side. So as not to be all-the-way-gay. But my tubby husband here is one hundred percent queer. He loves the cock.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: He certainly looks insatiable.
C: JAY
D: 'Bye
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: 'Bye
N: Jay, silent Bob and Suzanne head off down the road. Willenholly and all watch them go. The Sheriff is livid.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Well, it's not my way--but damned if there doesn't go one happy family. Now, we just shoot some tear gas into that diner, and when the two guys run out with the monkey, we'll--
E: balloon two
N: Willenholly suddenly freezes, thinking. He looks to the Sheriff.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: That was the them, wasn't it?
S: EXT. ROAD--DAY
N: Jay, Silent Bob and Suzanne are laughing.
C: JAY
D: I said you "love the cock"! I gotta be the craftiest motherfucker alive!
N: GUNSHOTS RING OUT, and bullets whiz by the trio, who are now in full panic mode. Willenholly and the Cops race after them, firing. Jay, Bob and Suzanne race away, ducking bullets.
C: JAY
D: FLEE, FAT-ASS, FLEE!!!
S: EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY
N: The trio race across what looks like a bridge (but isn't), shots still ringing out. Jay spots a manhole. He points at it, screaming.

S: INT. SEWER TUNNEL

D: Shut up!
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Sire, you're very taciturn.
N: Willenholly starts rolling up his sleeves as the sheriff looks on.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: You and your men stay up here. When I corner them, I'll call you for back-up.
C: SHERIFF
D: What're you doing? They're trapped. The only way they can get out of there is right here.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: A Federal Wildlife Marshal doesn't wait for his prey to come to him. He comes to it. Or goes to it. Is it "comes to it" or "goes to it"? I'm going in there. I'm counting on you Sheriff.
E: shakes it off
N: Willenholly embraces the Sheriff.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: You've taught me so much.
N: Willenholly then climbs into the sewer, disappearing. The Cops look at the Sheriff for a beat, who heads O.C. saying--
C: SHERIFF
D: Fuck this asshole. Let's go back to the station and get some donuts.
S: INT. SEWER TUNNEL--DAY
N: TIGHT on Jay, Bob, and Suzanne, looking into the distance, bathed by natural light. We HEAR the loud sounds of water rushing.

C: JAY
D: See, man?! He's lining us up like fucking circus seals! Well, I'm going first--I don't want no mouthful of monkey-spit when I gotta blow this fucking G-Man.
N: TIGHT on Suzanne, who's looking down at the raging water below. Her brow hardens with purpose. TIGHT on Suzanne's right hand grabbing Jay's right hand. TIGHT on Suzanne's left hand grabbing Bob's left hand. Suzanne leaps forward at us, pulling Jay and Silent Bob backwards.

Jay and Silent Bob climb over the cliff onto the highway just in time to see-- The passenger door slamming on a TRUCK with Los Angeles plates and a sign that reads CRITTERS OF HOLLYWOOD. Suzanne is looking out the back window waving. Jay and Bob leap to their feet, chasing after the truck.

E: pissed
N: Silent Bob mimes that they should go after Suzanne.
C: JAY
D: Go after the monkey? How the fuck are we supposed to know where that thing's going?
N: Silent Bob mimes in the direction the car went. Jay stares at him.

N: We start on the street sign, and PAN DOWN to a JEEP WRANGLER that pulls up. A gorgeous woman in sunglasses drives, with Silent Bob sitting in the back seat. After a beat, Jay pops up from under the dash, wiping his mouth, looking around. The Woman sighs, and zips up her pants. Jay and Bob hop out and wave to the Woman as the car pulls away. Bob offers Jay a look.
C: JAY
D: What? It's not like it's cheating. Justice blew up.
N: Two HOOKERS approach them. HOOKER 1 Hey, little man. You want some of this? HOOKER 2 How about you, Big Boy? HOOKER 1 If you've got fifty bucks we can get nasty.

D: Alright--first, I'll want to tongue your bung while you juggle my balls in one hand and play with my asshole with the other. But don't stick you finger in. Then. I'll wanna pinky you and put it in your friend's brown, while Silent Bob spanks into a Dixie cup. After that, I'll wanna smell your titties, for a while, and you can pull my nutsack up over my dick, so it looks like a Bullfrog. Then I want you to flick at my nuts while your friend spanks me into the same Dixie cup Silent Bob jizzed in. Then we throw the Dixie cup out.
N: The Hookers look at him, dumbfounded, Then-- HOOKER 1 Oh, that's it honey. I quit. (walking away) This job just passed the point of no return. HOOKER 2 (to Jay) You one fucked up puppy, poppie.
C: JAY
D: What?! You said 'nasty'? Man, chicks in Hollywood are so stuck up.

S: EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD.--LATER
N: Jay and Silent Bob walk.
C: JAY
D: Alright, here's the plan: first, we find out where they're shooting that movie at. After we shut that shit down, we can start looking for the monkey. But before we do any of that shit, we gotta find a motherfucker in the know. Someone who's like, the mayor of Hollywood.
N: They pass a DEALER leaning against a wall, trying to make a sale.

C: DEALER
D: You in this town and you gonna ask that question? Be a little more specific.
C: JAY
D: It's a Miramax flick. We gotta bust it up so people stop calling us names on the Internet, even though they're not really talking about us but these characters based on us, and at the same time, find my ex-girlfriend-who- got-killed-in-a-car-explosion's monkey.
N: Jay exhales. The Dealer stares at him for a beat.
C: DEALER
D: I don't know that the fuck you just said, little kid. But you touched a brother's heart, so I'm gonna help you out with some directions to the studio.

D: No, Steve. But I did see Casey Affleck buying a soda at a concession stand earlier.
C: STEVE
D: But no sign of Jay and Silent Bob?
C: JULES
D: None whatsoever. However, to be fair, all the feds have to work with is murky videotape, so no one's even a hundred percent sure what Jay and Silent Bob look like, exactly. For all we know, they could already be on the lot.
N: As Jules speaks, Jay and Bob walk into the frame behind her, looking up at the studio sign. They then notice the camera and start waving behind Jules.

S: INT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME
N: Jay and silent Bob stand amidst a line of EXTRAS. Silent Bob looks O.C. goes wide-eyed, and pokes Jay, pointing O.C. Jay looks and sees-- A COLLEGE BAR set that looks like the College Bar from Good Will Hunting, complete with CLARK (the stuffy college jerk). MATT DAMON stands off to the side, loosening up for the scene. BEN AFFLECK calls to the O.C. DIRECTOR.
C: BEN
D: Where are we taking it from, Gus?
N: Gus Van Sant sits off to the side, counting a stack of money. He just shrugs.
C: GUS
D: I'm busy.
C: BEN
D: You're a true artist, Gus
C: MATT
D: Just take it from "It's a good course."
C: BEN
D: Oh, now you're the director.
C: MATT
D: Hey, shove it. Bounce-boy. Let's remember who talked who into doing this shit in the first place. Talking me into Dogma was one thing, but this--
C: BEN
D: I'm sorry this is taking you away from whatever-gay-killers-on-horses- who-like-to-play-golf-touchy-feely- flick you're supposed to be doing this week.
C: MATT
D: Oh--I'm touchy-feely? I take it you never saw Forces of Nature?
C: BEN
D: You're like a child. What've I been telling you? Sometimes you've gotta do the safe picture. Sometimes, you do it for art. Sometimes, it's the payback picture your friend says you owe him--
N: They take a beat and look at the camera. Then--
C: BEN
D: And sometimes, you go back to the well.
C: MATT
D: And sometimes, you do Reindeer Games.
C: BEN
D: Now that's just mean.
N: Jay turns excitedly to Bob.
C: JAY
D: This has gotta be the Bluntman Flick, 'cause that's those two fucks from that Mork movie! Now all we gotta do is figure out a way to get close to them--
N: The A.D. grabs Jay and Bob by the arms and drags them onto the set, placing them near Ben and Matt in the scene.
C: A.D.
D: Just stand there and react. Don't say anything.
N: Bob goes a little wide-eyed. Jay smiles at him.
C: JAY
D: That's pretty funny.
E: off A.D.'s comment
C: A.D.
D: Alright, people. Lock it up. Let's go for picture.
E: calling out
N: Jay and Bob eye Ben and Matt fiercely, Ben and Matt are oblivious.
C: JAY
D: On the count of three, we rush those fucks and beat the shit out of 'em. 'Cause if they're all fucked up, they can't make the move, right? Alright, then. One--two--
C: CLAPPER/LOADER
D: Good Will Hunting Two: Hunting Season.
E: O.S.
N: Jay and Bob freeze and look at each other, then O.C. The Clapper/Loader holds a clapboard in front of Ben's face. It does indeed, read: Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season.
C: CLAPPER/LOADER
D: Scene sixteen, take five.
N: The Clapper/Loader claps the board closed and races off. Ben looks to Gus.
C: BEN
D: Action, Gus?
N: Gus looks up from counting his money.
C: GUS
D: Jesus, Ben--I said I'm busy.
N: Ben shakes his head and then starts the scene with CLARK.
C: BEN/CHUCKIE
D: You should check it out, it's a good course. But, you know, frankly, I found the class rather elementary.
C: CLARK
D: You know, I don't doubt that it was. I remember that class. It was just between recess and lunch.
C: BEN/CHUCKIE
D: Are we gonna have a problem, again?
C: CLARK
D: There's no problem. I was still just hoping you might give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the Southern Colonies. See, Wood says--
C: MATT/WILL
D: What'd I say? Didn't I say you'd be back here regurgitating Gordon Wood. But you forgot about Vickers--
E: stepping in
C: CLARK
D: No, I just read Vickers, so I'm up on inherited wealth, Hunting. But you're not the angry, brilliant young mind you once were, just itching to vent your frustrations.
N: In the background, Jay and Silent Bob get bored and head out of the shot. After a beat, they get pushed back in by the A.D.
C: CLARK
D: Once Sean told you it wasn't your fault, you lost the edge, William. You stopped hitting the books with a vengeance, and now I've read shit you haven't even heard about yet. Face facts, my friend--love made you a soft little pussy boy, unable to stand up to an academic showdown, like you used to. You're just no longer that good--Will Hunting. Now how do you like them apples?
E: gets in his face
N: Matt/Will turns away angrily, facing Ben/Chuckie, looking downwards, steaming.
C: BEN/CHUCKIE
D: I don't like the sound of them apples. Will, what're we gonna do now?
C: MATT/WILL
D: Chuckie-- It's Hunting season.
E: snarling
N: Matt/Will spins to face Clark with two huge guns in his hands. He blows Clark away, Jay and Bob hit the deck. Matt/Will stands there, guns smoking.
C: BEN/CHUCKIE
D: Apple sauce, bitch.
N: Suddenly the door to the soundstage swings open, and the Security guard Jay knocked out rushes in, followed by other SECURITY GUARDS who comb the place.
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: Sorry to interrupt, sirs, but have a ten-oh-seven on our hands.
C: BEN
D: Wait a second! I wasn't with any hookers today!
N: The Security Guard sees Jay and Bob crouched behind Ben, He points, screaming.
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: THERE THEY ARE!
N: Ben and Matt turn to Jay and Bob, Jay smiles.
C: JAY
D: Affleck, you're the bomb in Phantoms, yo.
N: Jay and Bob then race out-of-frame, closely followed by the Security guards. Matt head off, arms thrown in the air.
C: MATT
D: If anyone's looking for me, I'll be in my trailer trying to figure out how I got here from an Academy Award.
S: EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY
N: Jay and Bob rush out, pulling a bench in front of the door, blocking it. They race ten feet to another soundstage across from them and head inside a door.
S: INT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME
N: Jay and Silent Bob rush in to see-- Wes Craven getting ready to direct a scene with a familiar- looking GHOSTFACE KILLER and SHANNEN DOHERTY. The Clapper/Loader's clapboard reads: Scream 4
C: CLAPPER/LOADER
D: Scream four, scene thirty-seven, take one.
E: claps it and rushes off
C: WES CRAVEN
D: Action!
N: The Killer chases Shannen around the room, falling over stuff, until she hits him with a lamp, knocking him out.
C: SHANNEN DOHERTY
D: Alright, you bastard! Let's see who you really are!
N: Shannen pulls the mask off the short performer to reveal SUZANNE. Jay and Silent Bob go wide-eyed.
C: SHANNEN DOHERTY
D: Fucking Miramax-- CUT!
E: getting up
N: Shannen heads over to Wes, holding the mask.
C: WES CRAVEN
D: Shannen, usually I say "cut."
C: SHANNEN DOHERTY
D: A monkey? Jesus, you guys aren't even trying anymore, are you?
C: WES CRAVEN
D: The market research suggest that people love monkeys.
N: Jay and Silent Bob rush in, grab Suzanne.
C: JAY
D: WE LOVE THIS MONKEY!
N: They rush out. West shrugs to Shannen.
C: WES CRAVEN
D: See?
N: Security Guards race through, chasing after the exited pair.
S: EXT. LOT--DAY
N: Jay and Bob race through the lot, with Bob carrying Suzanne. On a fake New York city street, another movie is shooting. The trio, bob and weave through the shoot, until-- At the end of the alley, a set GOLF CART pulls up, and four Security Guards pile out, forming a human wall, blocking their path. Jay and Bob stop dead, looking back to see the other Security Guards gaining.
C: JAY
D: What the fuck are we gonna do?
N: Just then, a P.A. on a bike pulls up nearby. He ditches the bike and grabs papers from the large hanging basket in front. Jay and Bob look at each other, race over to the bike, and jump on, putting Suzanne in the basket. They start pedaling away furiously, closely followed by the Security Guard posse. Silent Bob peddles like mad, racing toward the Golf Cart.
C: JAY
D: PUNCH IT!!!
N: Bob pops a wheelie and the Bike races up the front of the vehicle, taking flight, Below, the Security Guards stare in awe as-- Jay and Silent Bob atop the bike--with Suzanne in the front basket--go past a moon (on a billboard, on the side of a soundstage) a la E.T. Jay and Bob look down, then at each other. They smile. Then they look ahead and let out a scream. The bike crashes through a window in the side of a Soundstage Building.
S: INT. DRESSING ROOM--DAY
N: The Bike lands, and Jay and Bob, and Suzanne go tumbling onto the floor covered in glass. They look up to see. JAMES VAN DER BEEK AND JASON BIGGS dressed as Jay and Silent Bob, looking down as them.
C: JAMES
D: Holy shit--that looked like it hurt.
C: JASON
D: Are you guys alright? Hey! They've got a monkey!
E: off Suzanne
N: Jay and Bob look at their twins, then at each other.
C: JAY
D: Yo, I think that shit just kicked in.
C: JAMES
D: Let's get you guys on your feet.
N: James and Jason help Jay and Silent Bob to their feet. All stare at one another, perplexed, Then--
C: JAY
D: See man? Its never, "Hey--you were in Loser, or, "Dude--you rocked in Boys and Girls." It always comes back to that fucking pie! I'm haunted by it.!
E: to James
C: JAMES
D: Well, you put your dick in a pie, dude--
C: JASON
D: Enough! Jason Biggs.
E: to Jay
C: JAY
D: Yo-you really get to third base with the Russsian chick like you did in the movies?
C: JASON
D: You mean Shannon? Sadly, no.
C: JAY
D: She's fucking hot, man. If I was you, I'd been like--
N: Jay mimes a series of sexual maneuvers. Jason and James look on, bewildered.
C: JAY
D: What, man? You never did one of these?
E: off James's-look
N: Jay starts miming again, and suddenly stops, staring at James, blown away.
C: JAY
D: Holy shit? You're the Dawson!
C: JAMES
D: It's James, actually. James Van Der Beek.
C: JAY
D: Yo, what's up with Pacey stealing Joey away from you? If I was you, I would've drowned his ass in your Creek and shit!
C: JAMES
D: I know, Because what--is Josh better looking than me? Fuck, no. I mean, who on earth is better looking that me? I ask you.
C: JAY
D: Joey, man! She's too fine! Yo--did you ever get to third base with her?
C: JAMES
D: Well, there was this one time-- Wait a second--who are you guys?!
E: catching himself
C: JASON
D: They're our stunt doubles, dumbass. Right?
E: to Jay
C: JAY
D: Stunt doubles for what?
C: JAMES
D: The movie we start shooting in a few minutes--Bluntman and Chronic Strike Back.
C: JASON
D: You're doubling me. I'm playing Bluntman, AKA Silent Bill.
E: to Bob
C: JAMES
D: Bob
C: JASON
D: Right. And he's playing Chronic. AKA Ray.
C: JAMES
D: Jay! Shit, did you even read the script?
C: JASON
D: There's a script?
N: Jay and Bob stare at them, blankly. Then Jay puts up his finger, indicating they should wait a minute. He gets into a huddle with Silent Bob and Suzanne.
C: JAY
D: These are the guys who are playing us, yo. We take them out, and bickety- bam! No movie.
N: Silent Bob nods at Jay, then Suzanne. Suzanne heads off, leaving Jay and Bob to huddle.
C: JASON
D: What's with the weird, gay huddle going on over there?
E: off Jay and Bob, to James
C: JAMES
D: What's gay about it? It's two guys talking in a corner. Man--why are you such a homophobe.
C: JASON
D: I'm not a homophobe.
C: JAMES
D: You are. You're always calling things gay. "Ooo--look at the gay huddle, dude!"
N: Suzanne approaches them.
C: JASON
D: Hey--look at the monkey.
C: JAMES
D: Next you're going to tell me the monkey's gay.
C: JASON
D: He's so cute-- C'mere. Monkey. C'mere--
E: to Suzanne
N: Suzanne pulls Jason and James out of the frame. While Jay and Silent Bob continue to huddle, the sounds of a beating are heard, O.C.
C: JAY
D: Alright, here's what we do: start swinging, and don't stop until those young Hollywood fucks are out of commission. Ready? Break!
N: Jay and Bob spin to face Jason and James--only to go wide- eyed. Suzanne stands atop the fallen actors, who are bloodied and beaten and knocked out cold. She holds her hands skyward, clasped like a champion.
C: JAY
D: That's one funky monkey.
N: Suddenly there's a banging at the door of the dressing room.
C: VOICE
D: Mister Biggs? Mister Van... Der-- Beek? This is Security. We've got a pair of intruders at large, and they crashed through a window we thought might be yours.
E: O.S.
C: JAY
D: Uh--yeah. They're in here.
E: to door; deepening voice
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: Do they have you hostage? Should we call your publicists?
C: JAY
D: NO! I mean, we kicked those guys' asses bad. They're--knocked out.
S: EXT. DRESSING ROOM--SAME
N: The Security Guards stand outside a door marked James.
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: Great work, sirs! If you let us in, we'll take over--
C: JAY
D: NO! Me and Jason Biggs are naked in here! Together!
E: O.S. through door
N: The Security guard look at one another.
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: Uh--okay. We'll just be--outside the door, sirs.
N: The Security Guards stifle a laugh, as one makes a blow job face to the rest.
S: INT. DRESSING ROOM--DAY
N: Bob opens an AIR VENT in the wall. He puts Suzanne into it and hands her the tranquilizer gun, miming to her. She nods, and starts crawling through the ductwork, Bob closes the vent again, and starts rifling through a nearby closet.
C: JAY
D: What the fuck are we gonna do?! How are we gonna get out of here without them seeing us?
N: Silent Bob pulls a pair of hangered COSTUMES from the closet, smiling.
S: EXT. LOT--DAY
N: The Security Guards push a cuffed Jason and James into a waiting Cop Car. The pair are still dressed like Jay and Silent Bob.
C: JAMES
D: YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUYS!
C: JASON
D: HEY! DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME?! I'M THE PIE-FUCKER.
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: He'll be the pie--in prison.
E: to Cops
S: INT. SOUNDSTAGE HALLWAY--DAY
N: Jay and Bob creep toward a door (we don't see the outfits).
C: JAY
D: This was a good idea, Lunchbox. In these outfits we're totally incognito.
N: Suddenly, and A.D. appears, grabbing them by the shoulders.
C: A.D.
D: Mister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek? Great--you've changed costumes already. Let's get you to set. The director doesn't like to be kept waiting.
E: pulling them off
S: INT. SOUNDSTAGE--BLUNTCAVE SET
N: It looks like the Batcave, but it's not. Off to the side, near the monitor and chair setup, a black DIRECTOR eyeballs the hustling, white crew.
C: DIRECTOR
D: Look at all these crackers, Seventy million dollars and I can't even get a black grip?
N: A white P.A. brings a cup of latte to the Director.
C: P.A.
D: Here's your coffee, sir.
C: DIRECTOR
D: You spit in this? Because I know all you white folks are pissed off that the studio'd entrust a multi- million dollar to a brother.
E: eyes the coffee
C: P.A.
D: I didn't spit in it, sir.
C: DIRECTOR
D: Then taste it! Go on!
N: The P.A. takes the cup and sips from it. He tries to hand it back to the Director.
C: P.A.
D: It's all good, sir.
C: DIRECTOR
D: No it ain't all good. Oh, you think I want it now, after your lips touched the cup? Get the fuck off my set!
C: P.A.
D: You the man, sir.
C: DIRECTOR
D: No you the Man! And that's the problem!
N: The Director glares at the scared P.A., as he cautiously skulks off. BANKY EDWARDS approaches.
C: BANKY
D: Uh, Chaka? Yeah, hi--I'm Banky Edwards, the creator of Bluntman and Chronic. We met a few weeks back. I'm the executive producer.
C: DIRECTOR/CHAKA
D: Oh--you're the executive producer, hunh? Well go "produce" me a latte no white folks spit in--okay Fucky?
C: BANKY
D: Banky. I just wanted you to know that I respect your work as an artist. I'm something of an artist myself. I was the inker on the comic book.
C: CHAKA
D: An inker? What, like you trace?
N: Banky's face drops as the A.D. joins them.
C: A.D.
D: Biggs and Van Der Beek are on the set, Chaka.
C: CHAKA
D: I don't see 'em. Where are they? WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE STARS OF THIS PIECE OF SHIT?!
E: into bullhorn
N: On the Bluntcave set, two massive doors open in the fake rock. Smoke pours in, and Jay and Silent Bob--now dressed as BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC--step from the darkness. Jay and Bob survey the set, amazed.
C: JAY
D: This must've set 'em back a couple hundred bucks.
C: CHAKA
D: Look at this shit. A gay hood ornament, and the color Purple.
E: off their outfits
C: JAY
D: Who the fuck are you?
C: CHAKA
D: Who the fuck am I? I'm the fucking director, is who I am. Chaka Luther King. The creator of all of this.
C: JAY
D: Wait a sec--I thought Holden and Banky created this shit.
C: CHAKA
D: And I'm stealing it. I'm taking it back for all the shit you people have stolen from us! Did you know, I came up with the idea for Sesame Street before PBS? I was going to call it N.W.P.--Niggaz with Puppets. Alright--enough small talk. Let's shoot it.
E: beat
N: Chaka heads back toward his monitor. Jay and Bob are confused.
C: JAY
D: Wait, wait, wait!! Aren't you gonna direct us?
C: CHAKA
D: I'll be directing you to the food stamps line after I fire your ass, if you talk back like that to me again!
C: JAY
D: But we don't know what we're supposed to do here. We didn't even read the script.
C: CHAKA
D: So? Neither did I. Shit, neither did the studio. Look man, it's not hard. In this scene, the bad guy breaks into the Bluntcave. You make up some shit, fight him for a while, I film it, I yell "cut," and then head back to my trailer, where I got more white women waiting for me there than the first lifeboat off the Titanic! They all want a part of the movie, and I got just the part for 'em.
E: pointing O.C. confidentially
N: Jay and Silent Bob go wide-eyed, as Chaka heads off.
C: CHAKA
D: LET'S ROLL WITH THE NEW!
C: A.D.
D: QUIET ON THE SET! THIS IS A TAKE!
E: O.S.
N: Chaka climbs behind his monitor. The P.A. is waiting for him with another cup of coffee.
C: P.A.
D: I got you another cup of coffee, sir. Spit free.
N: Chaka smacks the coffee out of his hand and sits down. The Clapper/Loader jumps in front of the startled Jay and Bob, getting ready. After a beat, he turns to Silent Bob.
C: CLAPPER/LOADER
D: I just wanna say that I loved when you fucked that pie. BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC STRIKE BACK, SCENE THIRTY-SEVEN, TAKE ONE!
E: calling off
N: The clapper/Loader shuts the clapboard and races off. From behind the monitor, Chaka calls out--
C: CHAKA
D: ACTION!
N: Jay and Bob (as Bluntman and Chronic) look at each other for a beat. Then--
C: JAY/CHRONIC
D: Uh--Snootchie Bootchies.
N: Suddenly, the wall to their left explodes. Jay and Bob hit the deck. Through the smoking rubble steps COCK-KNOCKER--the arch--nemesis of Bluntman and Chronic. He's a normal-looking man with huge, overgrown FISTS.
C: JAY/CHRONIC
D: What the fuck?
C: COCK-KNOCKER
D: You thought I'd never find your precious Bluntcave, did you, Hemp Knight? But now you and your sidekick are finally in the grasp of Cock- Knocker!
C: JAY/CHRONIC
D: Why do they call you "Cock-Knocker"?
N: Cock-Knocker slams one of his huge fists into Jay's balls. Jay drops to his knees, wailing. Cock-Knocker then pulls a vibrator-looking device from his cape. He presses a button on it and a laser beam rises out of the vibrator, like a light saber.
C: COCK-KNOCKER
D: Any last words before I bust your balls, Bluntman?
N: Silent Bob quickly looks right, then left. His eyes fall on-- A wall of armaments, on which hands a SILVER BONG, under the placard: BONG SABER--EXTREMELY EXPERIMENTAL. DO NOT USE. It's out of his reach. Silent Bob closes his eyes, concentrating. He reached his hand out to the Bong Saber, attempting the Jedi Mind Trick. Suddenly, the Bong snaps from the armory into Bob's grip. The Bong Saber blasts to life and Bob strikes a defensive pose. Bob rushes the astonished Cock-Knocker and the pair start light saber dueling.
C: CHAKA
D: Damn! Now that was one special effect! This picture's gonna make House Party look like House Party Two!
E: from behind monitor
C: A.D.
D: Or House Party Three?
C: CHAKA
D: Shut the fuck up!
N: Cock-Knocker battles Bob back. He vogues some impressive blade handling, prompting Bob to make a run for it--up the ladder of the Bong Reactor and over Cock-Knocker's head. He lands behind Cock-Knocker, striking another pose. Cock- Knocker then high- kicks Bob in the face, knocking him on his ass across the floor. Cock-Knocker rushers over to deliver a saber kill-shot, when we hear--
C: JAY
D: YO-BITCH-FISTS!
E: O.S.
N: Cock-Knocker turns to see-- Jay, standing on the rotating monitor station, holding a double-sided saber. He clicks it and TWO beams emit (a la the Darth Maul light saber in Episode One).
C: JAY
D: Call me Darth Balls. Bunngg.
N: Jay leaps at Cock-Knocker, wielding the double-beamed Bong Saber.
C: CHAKA
D: I think George Lucas is going to sue somebody--
E: from behind the monitor
S: EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY
N: Willenholly's car screeches up, and Willenholly jumps with a shotgun. He slides across the hood of the car and lands beside the flashing red light.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: So, this is Hollywood? Lights, camera, action, Jay and Silent Bob.
E: looking around suddenly full of purpose
N: Willenholly cocks his shotgun and heads for the door.
S: INT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY
N: The door bursts open, and Willenholly charges in, firing two shots, O.C.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: FREEZE YOU TERRORIST SONSABITCHES!!!
N: Willenholly goes wide-eyed. It's not Bluntcave. We're on a different soundstage, where a kid's movie's being shot: Mooby's Grand Adventure. There's a Barney-sized MOOBY surrounded by little KIDS. The Kids stare back at Willenholly terrified. The Mooby suit has smoking bullet holes in it. Mooby collapses.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Oh my God-- Um--sorry. That was supposed to be a warning shot. Uh--it looks like I'm on the wrong, uh--wrong set.
E: to kids
N: The Kids look at the fallen Mooby. On looks angrily at the O.C. Willenholly.
C: KID
D: You killed Mooby-- LET'S GET HIM!!!
E: to Kids
N: The Kids charge Willenholly, who screams like a woman as he's attacked.
S: INT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME
N: Jay attacks Cock-Knocker with his Bong Saber, full throttle.
C: COCK-KNOCKER
D: You are not upstaging me, Van Der Beek!
E: breaking character
N: Jay whacks away happily at the actor playing Cock-Knocker, hacking him up onto the ladder of the Bluntcave's nuclear reactor. Cock-Knocker climbs the ladder slightly to evade the attack, dueling Jay back with the saber in his other hand.
C: COCK-KNOCKER
D: CHAKA--CALL OFF DAWSON! GIVE ME A "CUT"!
E: to O.C. Chaka
N: On cue, Jay delivers a kill-shot to one of Cock-Knocker's huge fists, cutting it off (a la Empire). Silent Bob joins Jay, as Jay turns off this double-Bong Saber, Jay grins at Cock-Knocker.
C: JAY
D: Now whose balls have been busted, bitch?
N: Suddenly, a gun shot rings out. All turn to see a roughed-up Willenholly, training his gun first on Jay, then Bob.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: The C.L.I.T. stops here, Jay and Silent Bob! Everyone stay calm. I'm a Federal Wildlife Marshal. These men are the leaders of a terrorist organization wanted for the abduction of a monkey.
E: revealing badge: calling out
C: VOICE
D: They didn't really steal that monkey.
E: O.S.
N: All turn to see Justice approaching from the shadows. Willenholly trains his gun on her. Jay's mouth drops.
C: JUSTICE
D: It was just a diversion so we could steal these.
N: Justice pulls the bag of diamonds from her jacket, revealing them.
C: JUSTICE
D: And they're not the leaders of C.L.I.T. The C.L.I.T. is not real.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: No--the clit's real. The female orgasm is a myth.
C: JUSTICE
D: Are you guys alright?
E: to Jay
C: JAY
D: I thought you blew up, Boo Boo Kitty Fuck.
C: JUSTICE
D: You remembered. It was a frame-up, Jay. Sissy. Missy, Chrissy, and I are international jewel thieves. We were setting you up as a patsy, but I couldn't go through with it, because I... because I love you.
E: smiling back to business
C: JAY
D: Yeah? So that means you'll fuck me, right?
C: VOICE
D: If she does, it'll be considered necrophilia.
E: O.S.
N: All turn to see Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy slinking from the shadows, guns drawn.
C: SISSY
D: Because she's gonna be one dead bitch. Hi, Jussy. We catch you at a bad time?
E: to Justice
C: MISSY
D: You should've just let these guys go down, Jussy.
C: JAY
D: Hey, I wanted to go down, but I was waiting until I got to know her a little better. See, there was this little angel on my shoulder, and he said--
C: CHRISSY
D: Shut the fuck up before I shoot you where you stand in your pansy red booties.
C: JAY
D: Holy shit, I am wearing pansy red booties! Man--why the fuck didn't you tell me?
E: looking down to Bob
C: SISSY
D: Let's have those diamonds, Jussy.
C: JUSTICE
D: I can't do that, Sissy
C: SISSY
D: Then lover--boy gets one in the brain.
E: points her gun at Jay
C: CHAKA
D: YO!
N: All turn to look at Chaka.
C: CHAKA
D: Would any of you lovely ladies like a private audition to be in my movie?
N: Justice high-kicks the gun out of Sissy's hand. It lands on the ground discharging. Then everyone starts shooting and running for cover. Jay and Silent Bob hurl themselves over the Bluntmobile. Missy and Chrissy flip over a lavish, exquisitely-packed craft service table labeled. CAST. They pop back up and start firing at Willenholly. Willenholly leaps behind a barren craft service table that holds a bag of Smarties and a dented can of RC Cola. He pops up and returns fire. When both are out of bullets, they drop back down behind the table and reload. From behind his table, Willenholly yells--
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: WHY ARE YOU SHOOTING AT ME?!?! I'M JUST A FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL!!!
C: CHRISSY TWO REASONS: ONE--WE'RE WALKING,
D: TALKING BAD GIRLS, CLICHES!
C: MISSY
D: AND TWO: BECAUSE YOU'RE A MAN.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: ONLY ON THE OUTSIDE!
N: The Girls and Willenholly both pop back up and open fire again. Chaka ducks behind the monitor.
C: CHAKA
D: A shitload of white people with guns? Time to get my black ass out of here!
N: He races off, passing Justice and Sissy, who circle each other defensively, striking kung fu poses.
C: SISSY
D: You really let me down, Justice. Throwing it all away for a little stoner with bad pronunciation.
C: JAY
D: HEY!
E: O.S.
C: JUSTICE
D: What's it gonna be, Sissy? Which fighting style do you want me to kick your ass in?
E: ignoring him
C: SISSY
D: Are you kidding me? I taught you all all your moves myself. There's not a style you can bust that I can't defend against.
C: JUSTICE
D: You're no match for my "Shaolin Monk."
C: SISSY
D: Yeah, but I can bury you with my "Crouching Tiger."
C: JUSTICE
D: A little "Venus's--flytrap"?
C: SISSY
D: I'll counter with "Dragon Crane."
C: JUSTICE
D: How about a little "Bitch, My Man Ain't Yo Baby's Daddy"?
C: SISSY
D: Bring it on.
E: beat; smiles
N: Justice rushes Sissy and instead of sleek kung fu, they launch into a down-and-dirty, girl's cat-fight; hair pulling and screaming. Behind the Bluntmobile, Jay and Bob watch all the action.
C: JAY
D: Yo--I hope one of 'em rips the other one's shirt off and we see some tit.
N: Both Bob and Jay smile at each other, nodding. Banky joins them, crawling in on his belly, covering his head.
C: BANKY
D: Mister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek? I just wanted to say hi. I'm--
C: JAY
D: Banky fucking Edwards! Just the motherfucker we came to see!
C: BANKY
D: Holy shit! What the fuck are you guys doing here?!
E: shocked
N: Sissy has Justice on her belly, banging her face into the floor, screeching. Jay, Bob, and Banky continue.
C: BANKY
D: Stop the movie?! Are you crazy?!
C: JAY
D: All these assholes are calling us names on the Internet, 'cause of this stupid movie!
C: BANKY
D: I feel for you boys--I really do. Those Net snipers can be really cruel. But Miramax paid me a shitload of money for Bluntman and Chronic, so it occurs to me that people bad- mouthing you on some web-site is none of my FUCKING CONCERN!
C: SILENT BOB
D: Oh--but I think it is.
N: Banky stares at Silent Bob, agog, Jay rolls his eyes.
C: JAY
D: Here we go again--
C: SILENT BOB
D: Shut the fuck up. We had a deal with you on the comics for likeness rights. And as we're not only the artistic basis but also the character basis for your intellectual property, Bluntman and Chronic, when we said property was optioned by Miramax Films you were legally obliged to secure our permission to transfer the concept to another medium. As you failed to do that, you're in breach of the original contract--ergo, you find yourself in a very actionable position.
E: to Banky
N: Banky stares at Bob, even more agog, joined by Jay. After a beat, Jay adds--
C: JAY
D: Yeah.
N: Justice now has the advantage over Sissy, holding her head and kicking her in the face, repeatedly, screaming.
C: BANKY
D: So, what do you guys want, to go away and take your lady friends with you?
C: JAY
D: Shitcan this movie so we don't get called names on the Internet anymore.
C: BANKY
D: Even if there's no movie, people are still free to talk shit about you on the Internet. That's what the Internet's for: slandering others anonymously. Stopping the flick isn't going to stop that!
N: In the background, we see Justice high-kick Sissy into the air.
C: JAY
D: Well this isn't fair! We went to Hollywood, I fell in love, we stole a monkey, we got shot at, and got punched in the motherfucking nuts! We ain't leaving empty-handed!
N: On cue, Sissy drops from above, landing in Jay's lap.
C: JAY
D: What's up baby? You look good!
C: BANKY
D: Isn't that your girlfriend's enemy?
C: JAY
D: Oh yeah. Get the fuck offa me, pig!
E: pushing Sissy off him
N: Sissy races at Justice, leaping atop her, pulling her hair. Jay, Bob, and Banky continue.
C: BANKY
D: You guys are gonna ruin my movie career.
C: JAY
D: Well, we want something for our mental anguish.
C: BANKY
D: Tell you what: we'll settle this monetarily. I'll give you half of what I made.
C: JAY
D: Half?!?
C: BANKY
D: Half's not good enough? Fine--I'll give you two-thirds of what I made!
C: JAY
D: Fuck-you--you already said half? You can't take it back!
N: Silent Bob rolls his eyes, Banky shakes Jay's hand.
C: BANKY
D: Done
N: Justice throws Sissy off, onto the floor. Both get up, facing each other.
C: SISSY
D: Your shit is so tired, Justice!
C: JUSTICE
D: Call me Boo-Boo Kitty Fuck--BITCH!
N: Justice high-kicks Sissy and she goes flying across the stage. Sissy sails toward the craft service table, landing atop Missy and Chrissy, knocking them out. Willenholly stands to see why the girls stopped shooting.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Hello? Truce? I think I killed both of them.
E: beat
N: Suddenly, he lets out a shriek and falls forward, revealing a tranquilizer dart in his ass, and SUZANNE standing behind him, holding the gun up in the air. Justice surveys her handiwork for a beat, then calls off toward the Bluntmobile.
C: JUSTICE
D: C'mon guys. It's over.
N: Jay, Bob, and Banky pop up from behind the car and join her.
C: JAY
D: Yo, I was just about to jump in there and get your back.
N: Then, the SOUND of SIRENS rings out in the distance.
C: JAY
D: Holy shit, the cops! We gotta get out of here!
C: JUSTICE
D: No. I'm tired of running.
N: Justice lifts Willenholly into a sitting position and taps his face.
C: JUSTICE
D: You awake, Marshal? Marshal?
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Oh my God, I'm paralyzed. The monkey shot me in the ass and paralyzed me! Oh the irony!
E: tries to move but can't
C: JUSTICE
D: You're not paralyzed. It was just a tranquilizer.
E: off Suzanne's gun
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Jesus! Tranqued by a little monkey! My friends in the Bureau are never gonna let me live this down!
C: JUSTICE
D: You have friends in the F.B.I.?
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: They all made it in, but I failed the exam. Why the hell else do you think I became a Federal Wildlife Marshal? 'Cause I'm a joke!
E: crying
N: Justice looks toward the direction of the sirens, thinking. Then--
C: JUSTICE
D: Maybe not. I can make you a deal that'll get you into the F.B.I., regardless of test scores.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: What kind of deal?
C: JUSTICE
D: You drop the charges against Jay and Silent Bob and say you never found the ape. Make sure the world knows they're not in control of any C.L.I.T.
C: JAY
D: Now wait a second--
C: JUSTICE
D: I'll explain later, Jay In exchange, I'll give you the diamonds I stole, and turn in Sissy, Missy, Chrissy, and myself. But I want a reduced sentence.
E: to Willenholly
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: You'd be willing to do that?
C: JUSTICE
D: For him? I'd be willing to do anything.
E: off Jay
N: Justice stands and takes Jay by the hands.
C: JUSTICE
D: I'm an international jewel thief who's facing a jail sentence.
C: JAY
D: That's alright. I'm a junkie with a monkey.
C: JUSTICE
D: If I go to prison, will you wait for me?
C: JAY
D: I don't know. Will we fuck when you get out?
N: Justice smiles and kisses Jay Passionately. The kiss should say it all, but--
C: JAY
D: Don't change the subject. Will we fuck when you get out?
C: JUSTICE
D: Snoogans.
N: Justice and Jay kiss again. Suzanne reached up to Silent Bob, who picks her up. She grabs his face and kisses him. Willenholly looks to Banky.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Wow. There's a lot of love in the room.
C: BANKY
D: Regardless of what you may have heard. I do not kiss guys.
S: EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--LATER
N: Justice and Jay are still kissing, until Willenholly pulls her away and loads her into the waiting Cop Car.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Sorry, Justice. We've gotta go. Hey--stop stealing monkeys.
E: to Jay: friendly
C: JAY
D: Fuck you.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Fair enough.
N: Willenholly closes the door behind Justice and gets in the car.
C: JUSTICE
D: Wait for me.
E: to Jay
C: JAY
D: What--here?
N: Jay looks at Justice, confused, as the Cruiser pulls away, leaving Jay, Bob, Suzanne, and Banky. They start walking down the lot.
C: BANKY
D: Well, boys--you're rich in love-- Well, you're in love. And to top that off, you've got your own monkey. What more could two guys from Jersey possibly want?
E: indicating Jay
C: JAY
D: All those fucks to stop talking shit about us on the Internet, for starters.
C: BANKY
D: What do I keep telling you? There's not much you can do to stop that. Well, short of showing up at all their houses and beating the shit out of them, I guess.
N: Jay and Bob suddenly freeze. They look at each other and smile.
C: JAY
D: You know--with all that money we're gonna make we can buy a lotta plane tickets.
E: to Bob
N: START THE JAY AND BOB KICKASS MONTAGE
S: EXT. SKY--DAY
N: A passenger JET flies through the sky.
S: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET--DAY
N: Jay and Bob stand across the street from a house. They check the address on the big ream of paper they're carrying, nod at each other, and cross the street.
S: INT. HOUSE--DAY
N: The doorbell rings. A MOTHER answers it to see Jay and Silent Bob standing in the doorway.
C: MOTHER
D: Can I help you?
C: JAY
D: Yes. Ma'am, Does-- William Dusky live here?
E: reading of paper
C: MOTHER
D: Yes. He's my son.
C: JAY
D: May we talk to him, please.
C: MOTHER
D: One moment.
N: She walks away. After a beat, a fifteen-year-old KID comes to the door.
C: KID
D: Yeah?
C: JAY
D: Yo--do you post as-- Magnolia-Fan on Movie Poop Shoot.com?
E: reading off paper
C: KID
D: Yeah.
C: JAY
D: And did you write "Fuck Jay and Silent Bob. Fuck them up their stupid asses?
C: KID
D: Yeah, a while ago. So?
N: Jay and Bob nod at each other, then grab the KID, pull him outside, and start beating the shit out of him on his front lawn.
S: EXT. SKY--DAY
N: The passenger jet flies again, this time in the opposite direction.
S: EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE--DAY
N: Jay and Bob knocking at another door. Another MOTHER answers. They speak, she heads inside, and another KID comes to the door.
C: JAY
D: On Movie Poop Shoot.com. did you say Jay and Silent Bob-- "--are fucking clown shoes. If they were real, I'd beat the shit out of them for being so stupid."
E: reading off paper
C: KID
D: Yeah.
E: chuckling
C: JAY
D: Really--
N: Again, Jay and Bob pull the Kid outside and beat the shit out of him.
S: INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY
N: Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a CLERK.

S: INT. OFFICE--DAY
N: Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a BUSINESSMAN.
S: EXT. MOVIE THEATRE--NIGHT
N: The marquee reads: JASON BIGGS AND JAMES VAN DER BEEK ARE BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC! WORLD PREMIERE! The front doors open and the CROWD lets out. First we see DANTE and RANDAL.
C: RANDAL
D: Now that was worse then Clash of the Titans.
C: DANTE
D: I still can't believe Judy Dench played me.
C: RANDAL
D: Hey--remind me to renew that restraining order.
C: DANTE
D: Why?
C: RANDAL
D: Because I'm gonna blast the flick on the Internet tonight.
N: STEVE-DAVE and WALT exit.
C: STEVE-DAVE
D: Why can't Hollywood ever make a decent comic book movie?
C: WALT
D: Tell'em Steve-Dave!
C: STEVE-DAVE
D: Would you stop saying that?
N: ALYSSA and TRISH come out.
C: TRISH
D: Well, that was just another paean to male adolescence and its refusal to grow up.
C: ALYSSA
D: Yeah, sis--but it was better than Mallrats. At least Holden had the good sense to keep his name off of it.
C: TRISH
D: Why wouldn't Miramax option his other comic instead? You know--the one he drew about you and him and your relationship?
C: ALYSSA
D: You mean Chasing Amy? That would never work as a movie.
N: BANKY and HOOPER exit.
C: BANKY
D: I'm so fucking embarrassed--
C: HOOPER
D: Honey, you should be. They took your characters and reduced them to one ninety-minute-long-gay joke. It was like watching Batman and Robin again.
C: BANKY
D: Thanks. That means a lot coming from the guy who pretends to be Shaft as opposed to the guy who takes shaft.
C: HOOPER
D: I don't hear you complaining nightly. In fact, the only thing I do hear you say is "Yes, Hooper! Cradle the balls and work the shaft!"
C: BANKY
D: Hey! Hey! What'd we say? Not in public!
E: looking around
N: A guy behind them calls out to Banks.
C: GUY
D: Nice movie, you fucking Tracer!
C: BANKY
D: You--!
E: recognizing him
C: GUY
D: That's right, you sonovabitch! I'm back for round two!
N: Banky grabs the guy by the throat and starts choking him, while Hooper tries to break them up. WILLENHOLLY exits with Justice in hand-and leg cuffs and a prison uniform. They're flanked by two ARMED PRISON GUARDS.
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: You know, I don't get out to the movies much. But I'd have to say Bluntman and Chronic was Blunt-tastic!
C: JUSTICE
D: Are these leg cuffs really necessary?
C: WILLENHOLLY
D: Don't make me shoot you, Justice.
N: And finally, Jay and Silent Bob come out.
C: JAY
D: YO! THE PARTY'S ACROSS THE STREET, FEATURING THE GREATEST BAND IN THE WORLD: MORRIS DAY AND THE TIME!!!
N: WHIP PAN to Morris day and The Time on stage, performing "The Bird." During the song, Morris points to-- Jay and Bob, who are dancing with Suzanne and Justice (who's still in cuffs, flanked by the Guards). Jay looks to Bob, they nod at each other and-- Jay and Silent Bob, join Morris Day and the TIME onstage, and dance us out to the coda, which reads-- CODA Bluntman and Chronic Strike Back went on to make a mere 2.3 million at the box office. It was the biggest commercial failure in the history of Miramax films. The film was roundly drubbed as a bad idea by the denizens of the Internet chat boards, and over the course of the next year, while they waited for the Quick Stop restraining order to expire, Jay and Silent Bob tracked them all down and beat the shit out of them. CREDITS. THEN--
S: INT. NOWHERE
N: A familiar WOMAN closes a book that's marked: THE VIEW ASKEWNIVERSE. She puts the book down, smiles at us and skips off. THE END
