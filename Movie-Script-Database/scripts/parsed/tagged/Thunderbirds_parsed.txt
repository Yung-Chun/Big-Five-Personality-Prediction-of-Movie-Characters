N: Animated scenes of the Thunderbirds on various rescues begin to play as some of the cast and crew names show up.
C: NARRATOR
D: From a secret island in the South Pacific, the courageous Tracy family run an organization called International Rescue. When disaster strikes, anywhere in the world, they are always first on the scene. They go by the name they gave their incredible machines, the Thunderbirds.
N: (Counts down numbers and shows corresponding Thunderbirds) Five, four, three, two, one. Thunderbirds are go! Cuts to live action, Alan Tracy is looking out a school window. But in this family of heroes, there is one son left behind.
C: TEACHER
D: So, gentlemen, we all know that A2 plus B2 equals... C2, that's right. But what happens when we bring in Leonardo Da Vinci's E, F and... Mr. Tracy!
E: Teacher notices Alan looking out window and not paying attention to the lesson
C: FERMAT
D: Alan. Alan!
N: Alan's head jerks back from the window and to the teacher who is now standing in front of him.
C: TEACHER
D: How kind of you to come back from outer space, Alan. I trust re-entry wasn't too rough?
N: (Chuckles sarcastically and continues sounding even more annoyed) Here on Earth we've been discussing the Pythagorean theorem. Did any of that happen to sink in?
C: ALAN TRACY
D: I was just...
C: TEACHER
D: Apparently not "Thunderbirds are go."
E: she picks up his notebook which he has been doodling in
N: Well, I hope you aren't going anywhere special over spring break, Alan. Because I expect a 10,000 word paper on my desk the day you get back. That should keep you busy. Bells rings dismissing the students and Alan and Fermat walk out to their lockers.
C: ALAN
D: "That should keep you busy. Yeah, well you can take your 10,000 words and stick them right up your..."
E: mocking the teacher
C: FERMAT
D: Alan!
N: Both boys turn around to see the headmaster approaching them while walking by with the teacher from before
C: ALAN
D: Headmaster.
C: HEADMASTER
D: Mr. Tracy!
C: ALAN
D: Miss Garrett.
C: FERMAT
D: You gotta be more careful Alan.
C: ALAN
D: Why can't I tell 'em I'm a Thunderbird Fermat?
C: FERMAT
D: Because technically you're not a Thunderbirds yet. And if your identity was discovered, it would a d-d-di- it could be very bad.
C: ALAN
D: I know, I know.
C: EXCITED KID
D: It's the Thunderbirds. They're gonna be on TV. Let's go! They're gonna be on TV.
C: ALAN
D: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Where are they?
C: EXCITED KID
D: In Russia, at an oil rig fire.
C: ALAN
D: Great! I'm stuck at school and my brothers are on another cool mission.
C: FERMAT
D: Wanna watch?
C: ALAN
D: Yeah!
N: Boys go into a crowded room with a TV on the news channel
C: LISA LOWE
D: We are told this super-rig is now in danger of total collapse.
N: And there is real concern for the lives of six men who remain trapped on board. An emergency call went out to the Thunderbirds just a few minutes ago. They should be here any moment now. (pauses and points at the sky while exclaiming excitedly) And here they are! The boys watching the TV begin to cheer
C: SCOTT TRACY
D: Thunderbird 2 this is Thunderbird 1. I have visual, south
N: column, they're trapped on an inspection platform.
C: JEFF TRACY
D: FAB. We'll take it from here.
C: MULLION
D: Come on! Come on!
C: JEFF
D: Scott, get out. That tower's coming down.
C: SCOTT
D: Got it.
N: A blast of fire hits Thunderbird 1 and sends it a little farther away from the accident zone.
C: JEFF
D: Thunderbird 1 any damage?
C: SCOTT
D: Negative, Dad.
C: ALAN
D: Come on, come on! Swing around. You can't get close enough, taking that approach angle.
C: JEFF
D: This approach angle's no good. Gonna have to swing her around.
C: SCOTT
D: Watch the wind shear Thunderbird 2.
C: JEFF
D: Scotty, I was watching for wind shear when you were still wearing diapers.
C: ALAN
D: Come on, Dad.
N: A blast of fire comes toward Thunderbird 2
C: JEFF
D: Whoa! Hold on!
C: SCOTT
D: Who needs the diapers now, Dad?
C: FERMAT
D: What do they do now?
C: ALAN
D: Probably drop the rescue platform from Thunderbird 2.
C: VIRGIL TRACY
D: Open 'em up. Here we go. Rescue platform's on its way.
C: JEFF
D: Virgil, how's it going?
C: VIRGIL
D: It's looking good, Dad.
C: CREW MEMBER
D: Come on! Jump!
C: VIRGIL
D: Okay, I've got a visual. Hold it there. Targets locked. Firing rescue lines. (Directed toward the
N: crew members who he just fired the rescue lines toward) Come on, guys, hook 'em up. We gotta get you out of here.
C: CREW MEMBER
D: READY
C: ANOTHER CREW MEMBER
D: HOIST AWAY!
C: JEFF
D: Alright, let's haul them out.
C: FERMAT
D: Commencing reverse thrust.
C: JEFF
D: Okay, let's bring 'em home.
C: CREW MEMBER
D: Look out!
E: a couple of crew members bump into each other as they are hoisted up
C: ALAN
D: Man they gotta get 'em out fast. That rig's gonna blow.
C: CREW MEMBER
D: Hang on!
N: Boys watching the TV gasp as the crew goes down back toward the water a little bit
C: JEFF
D: Whoa sorry, boys. Hold on tight. Here we go.
C: ALAN
D: Come on, Virgil.
C: VIRGIL
D: Hold on guys
C: JEFF
D: How you doing, son?
C: VIRGIL
D: Never better
C: JEFF
D: Thunderbird 1, commence knockdown procedure.
C: SCOTT
D: FAB, Thunderbird 2. Lining up target.
E: after pressing a bunch of buttons on his control panel
N: Fire!
C: JEFF
D: Bull's-eye! Outstanding shot. All right boys, let's take these babies home.
C: LISA LOWE
D: As you can see the fire has been extinguished. The rocket fired from Thunderbird 1 has
N: robbed it of the oxygen it needed to burn. Amazing! The Thunderbirds have done it again, Chuck! ' The boys watching the TV with Alan and Fermat begin cheering.
C: CHUCK
D: That was great work, Lisa. Thanks a lot.
C: KNOW IT ALL KID
D: Ooh, I wish I could be a Thunderbird one
E: directed at Alan
N: day. Thunderturd! The boys in the room "ooohh" and look at Alan for a response
C: ALAN
D: That's another good one, diaper boy.
N: All the boys look at the Know It All Kid and laugh
C: HEADMASTER
D: Tracy! There's someone here for you.
E: after finding Alan in the sea of boys he continues
N: Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, at your service. Alan darling, your father's been unexpectedly detained. And he's asked me to pick you up. Is that all right?
C: FERMAT
D: Sure beats the bus!
C: ALAN
D: Definitely!
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: Fantastic. Now, will any of these gorgeous young things be joining you?
N: All of the boys raise their hands and shout for Alan to choose them.
C: ALAN
D: Just Fermat.
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: Quite right.
C: ALAN
D: Lady Penelope, why are you in America? Are you on a mission for my father?
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: Alan, shh! I am an undercover agent, so please try to be discreet. (camera pans over to
N: Lady Penelope's pink car with Parker, her butler waiting by the open door.) Here we are.
C: FERMAT
D: Hi, Parker.
C: PARKER
D: Good afternoon, Master Hackenbacker.
C: ALAN
D: Hi, Nosey.
C: PARKER
D: Less of that attitude, or I shall be obliged to deliver the Parker Haymaker.
C: ALAN
D: Okay, bring it on, big guy.
N: They are all in the car and Parker is driving away
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: Try not to run over any children, Parker.
C: PARKER
D: Very good, milady.
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: Come on, Parker, chop chop!
N: Lady Penelope's begins to fly
C: ALAN
D: All right!
C: FERMAT
D: Whoa!
C: ALAN
D: YES!
C: FERMAT
D: Yeah! the boys high five
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: Oh, look, Parker. Pink is the new black this season.
E: reading a newspaper
C: PARKER
D: I'm very glad to hear it, milady.
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: And hemlines are going up.
C: PARKER
D: That is good news, milady.
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: Oh and apparently England won the football last night.
C: PARKER
D: Yes! Eng-er-land!
E: his hands go off the steering wheel and the car begins to move to one side
C: FERMAT AND ALAN
D: Whoa!
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: Calm down, Parker.
C: PARKER
D: Yes, milady. Sorry, milady.
C: SCENE CHANGE TO
D: San Francisco City Hospital California, USA parking lot.
C: PANHEAD'S MOTHER
D: Come on, baby. Out you jump. (Turns to her teenage son who has a pan stuck on
N: his head) Wait till your father hears about this, panhead! They are walking toward the hospital entrance when she sees the lights of Thunderbird 2 Aliens!
C: PANHEAD
D: Even better! It's the Thunderbirds!
C: VIRGIL
D: OK, lock it up. Let's go. Let's move it. Hey, we need some help over here.
C: JEFF
D: Mission complete. Thunderbird 1 we are good to go.
C: SCOTT
D: FAB.
N: Mullion walks away from the others and fires a tracking goo at Thunderbird 1. Scene switches to a moving underwater submarine
C: MALE COMPUTER VOICE
D: Tracking device, activated.
C: THE HOOD
D: Ah, the chariot of the gods. Having dallied with the mortals,
N: they return to Olympus. And so I follow.
C: PARKER
D: Pardon me, milady. Approaching Tracy Island. And radar indicates we have some company.
N: Thunderbird 1 and 2 pull up next to Lady Penelope's flying car and Scott waves at Alan before Alan turns to look at Thunderbird 2 where his father salutes at him. Thunderbird 1 then does a barrel roll around Thunderbird 2 before they both jet off toward the island, leaving Lady Penelope's car behind.
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: Now, that's showing off.
C: ALAN
D: I wish that was me.
C: BRAINS
D: I'm about to run post flight checks, Mr Tracy. Anything I sh-sh-sh-
N: Anything you want to tell me?
C: JEFF
D: Brains, I noticed a build-up of vibration on Thunderbird 2, followed by illumination of the number 5
N: engine out light.
C: BRAINS
D: Okay, Mr. Tracy, I'll ch-ch-ch-study the flight data and guidance processor.
C: ALAN
D: Dad!
C: JEFF
D: Alan! Let me look at you. He hold Alan at arm's length and then looks him over. He then looks
N: over and sees his older sons approaching. Ah oh look out.
C: VIRGIL
D: Hey Sprout! ruffles his hair
C: SCOTT
D: ruffles his hair Hey Buddy!
C: ONAHA
D: Dinner's ready. Come and get it.
C: JEFF
D: Onaha, it smells delicious. I am starved.
C: ALAN
D: So Dad, I saw the mission on TV. It looked dangerous.
C: JEFF
D: Saving lives is a dangerous business. But it's what we do.
C: ALAN
D: Do you think the fire was caused by thermal up draughts? I mean that would explain the-- (Jeff
T: cuts him off)
C: JEFF
D: Whoa, whoa, whoa, enough shop talk. I want to hear about school.
C: ALAN
D: School's boring. Plus I've been thinking, maybe I could be home-educated now. That way, I could
N: sit in on missions from time to time. What do you think?
C: JEFF
D: No short cuts, Alan. No school, no rockets. Say, why aren't you wearing your retainer?
C: SCOTT
D: So I'm getting the reading telling me that the wind is blowing 60 knots, right up my keister.
C: VIRGIL
D: No kidding.
C: ALAN
D: Did you try readjust the flaps?
C: SCOTT
D: Well that's the first thing I did, Sprout! It's not my first day in a Thunderbird you know.
C: GORDON
D: Try and keep up!
C: VIRGIL
D: Yeah and don't you have homework to do or something?
C: GORDON
D: Unless he's blown up this school, like the last one!
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah, keep Alan away from the ships, he's a hazard.
C: JEFF
D: Okay, that's enough. Pass the salad.
C: VIRGIL
D: Man, I haven't seen that much fire since that volcano in Fiji.
C: SCOTT
D: That wasn't Fiji that was Istanbul.
C: VIRGIL
D: No, no, Istanbul was the earthquake.
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah well, nothing compares to Argentina.
C: ALAN
D: Dad, I'm not really hungry. Come on, Fermat. Let's go.
C: FERMAT
D: But! I'm not done! Okay.
E: sighs
N: After dinner
C: JEFF
D: Kyrano, have you seen Lady P?
C: KYRANO
D: By the pool.
C: JEFF
D: Of course.
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: Parker.
E: answers her ringing cell phone
N: Scene changes to Alan and Fermat about to enter Thunderbird 1's silo.
C: FERMAT
D: We're not supposed to go in there. We could get in trouble.
C: ALAN
D: Ah, you worry too much.
C: FERMAT
D: Where'd you get the access code for Thunderbird 1 anyway?
C: ALAN
D: Fermat, my friend, what you don't know, can't hurt you.
N: Scene changes back to Lady Penelope and Jeff by the pool
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: I'll be right there. It seems the fire at the oil rig was no accident.
C: JEFF
D: Any suspects?
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: Not yet, but I'll keep you posted.
C: ALAN
D: Thanks for bringing Alan home.
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: My pleasure. Any excuse to visit paradise.
C: JEFF
D: Tintin!
C: TINTIN
D: Hey, Mr. Tracy.
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: Hello, Tintin.
C: TINTIN
D: Good evening, Lady Penelope.
C: JEFF
D: Did you know Alan's home?
C: TINTIN
D: Alan's back? I mean, oh,
E: makes an annoyed face changes her tone to a more pleasant one
N: Alan's back! (looks at Kyrano) Hey, Dad.
C: JEFF
D: When are those two going to get along?
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: When Tintin decides the time is right. Girls always fire ahead of boys with that sort of
N: thing.
C: JEFF
D: What sort of thing?
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: Romance.
E: rolls her eyes
C: JEFF
D: Alan and Tintin? I didn't see that one coming.
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: No, you wouldn't.
C: JEFF
D: Have a safe flight home, Penny.
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: Thanks, Jeff.
N: Scene switches to Fermat and Alan playing around in Thunderbird 1 like they are really about to fly it into a mission.
C: ALAN
D: Okay, Fermat. Run pre-flight checks.
C: FERMAT
D: Right. Hydraulic systems are green.
C: ALAN
D: Commence main engine sequence.
C: FERMAT
D: FAB, Alan.
C: ALAN
D: Couldn't hurt to just fire up the instruments.
C: FERMAT
D: No wait, Alan! That's the Wrong switch!
E: Thunderbird 1 begins to start up and Fermat shouts
C: ALAN
D: Oh God. (There is loud beeping coming from the control panel and the boys can't shut down
N: Thunderbird 1) Oh, could this day get any worse? Scene briefly changes to Jeff getting an alert in his office.
C: JEFF
D: Alan, my office. Now. (Thunderbird 1 shuts
E: his face appears on a monitor in Thunderbird 1
N: down)
C: FERMAT
D: It just did.
N: The boys walk out of Thunderbird 1 and are walking toward the silo door. Fermat is running his hand on the nosecone of Thunderbird 1.
C: ALAN
D: I can't believe it.
C: FERMAT
D: We're so b-b-busted.
N: Fermat's hand touches the goo that Mullion fired at Thunderbird 1 earlier.
C: FERMAT
D: Look at this.
C: ALAN
D: What is it?
C: FERMAT
D: Looks like some sort of, gallium-electrolyte compound.
C: ALAN
D: We gotta get out of here.
N: Scene changes to Alan walking into his dad's office.
C: ALAN
D: Dad, I know you're mad. I shouldn't have been in the ship, but if you just give me a minute to
T: explain- (Jeff cuts him off)
C: JEFF
D: You're damn right you shouldn't have been in there!
C: ALAN
D: But, nothing happened Dad. I had it under control.
C: JEFF
D: Under control? Do you have any idea of the importance of secrecy in our operation? You fired up
N: a Thunderbird without activating the anti-detection shield. You put everyone in danger when you act selfishly. You want to be part of the team, you have to play by the rules. You understand? (Alan just looks at him) Do you?
C: ALAN
D: Yeah, I understand. I understand you don't want me to be a Thunderbird. You don't want me to
N: do anything. You won't even listen to me when I'm trying to tell you something important!
C: JEFF
D: I've heard enough. You're grounded for the rest of spring break.
C: ALAN
D: But, Dad!
C: JEFF
D: Bottom line, Alan. You need to grow up.
C: ALAN
D: Then let me. Please!
E: he stalks toward the door before whispering,
N: Jeff is starting at two old family photos on his desk when the video phone rings.
C: JEFF
D: Hey, John. I was just about to turn in. What can I do for you?
C: JOHN TRACY
D: I could sure use a pizza. You know a place that delivers?
C: JEFF
D: 30 minutes or it's free, right? Anything else on your mind?
C: JOHN
D: Well, got a forest fire in Vladivostok, a typhoon heading for Singapore. What's happening on
N: Planet Tracy?
C: JEFF
D: Alan's home for spring break.
C: JOHN
D: Yeah, I thought I could see a storm brewing in your region.
C: JEFF
D: Teenagers.
C: JOHN
D: Well, we've all been there. And Dad, you've done a great job since Mom died.
C: JEFF
D: Thanks, John. Keep an eye on that typhoon for us. And, uh, I'll call Vladivostok, see if they need
N: help with that fire.
C: JOHN
D: FAB, Dad. Sleep tight.
N: Fermat is down with his father in the Thunderbirds hanger.
C: FERMAT
D: Morning, Dad.
C: BRAINS
D: Hey, son. There's something I'd like to sh-sh-sh- Here, take a look.
C: FERMAT
D: The neural-net control system?
C: BRAINS
D: It's great to have you back. I bet you didn't think spring break was going to be this w- w-fun.
N: Watch this. Brains uses the neural-net control system to lift up the phone in front of him. It also lifts up the Mole which is stationed behind his workplace.
C: BRAINS
D: And that tiny phone lifts up, perfect.
C: FERMAT
D: Dad?
N: The neural-net control system short circuits.
C: BRAINS
D: N-n-n- Almost perfect.
C: FERMAT
D: There's something I want to talk to you about.
C: BRAINS
D: Oh. Right. Oh. OK, right. You're having problems with a g-g-g-chi-chi-chi-wo-wo-female?
C: FERMAT
D: N-no! No. Alan and I found some sort of gallium compound on the nosecone of Thunderbird
C: BRAINS
D: We should check that out st-st-st-immediately.
C: FERMAT
D: That'd be g-g-g-swell!
N: Scene skips to Alan skipping rocks at the beach. The camera follows one rock and it leads to a telescope coming out of the water. The telescope is connected to the Hood's submarine.
C: MULLION
D: The island is in sight.
C: THE HOOD
D: Transom, I need you.
C: TRANSOM
D: Yes, sir. Sir, our cloaking device has evaded their detection
N: systems. We have a positive visual from the tracking solution on Thunderbird 1.
C: THE HOOD
D: Mullion.
C: MULLION
D: Sir? Sir, armed and ready. Shall I target the main structure?
C: THE HOOD
D: Why would I want to destroy what will soon be mine? One of the principle tenets of Eastern
N: martial arts is to use your opponent's strength against him. The Hood uses his powers to keep Mullion in place
C: MULLION
D: This is ridiculous.
E: trying to move and realizing that he can't
C: THE HOOD
D: It will be almost impossible to force the Thunderbirds to leave their island. On the other
N: hand, it requires no effort at all to let them go. The Hood stops using his powers on Mullion and Mullion falls over.
C: THE HOOD
D: The Thunderbirds' purpose is to rescue. All we need do is give them the victim. (The Hood
N: looks at Transom) Commence targeting.
C: TRANSOM
D: Straightaway, sir. Target acquisition of Thunderbird 5 is locked.
C: THE HOOD
D: Fire.
N: Transom fires a missile at Thunderbird 5. Scene switches to John on Thunderbird 5 when suddenly alarms start to go off around him.
C: JOHN
D: What the?
C: JOHN
D: Thunderbird 5 to Tracy Island. Mayday! Mayday!
N: Missile hits Thunderbird 5 and John is blow back into a wall from the explosion. The scene then switches over to Tracy Island. Brains and Fermat run into Jeff's office.
C: BRAINS
D: Switching to Command and Control Center. (Brains uses a palm scanner to activate Command
N: and Control) The submarine is briefly showed getting closer to the island. Jeff, Scott, Virgil, and Gordon come running into Command and Control.
C: JEFF
D: How bad, Brains?
C: BRAINS
D: Thunderbird 5 major damage sustained. Possible m-m-m-Possible strike by m-
C: JEFF
D: Meteor?
C: BRAINS
D: Yep.
C: JEFF
D: Thunderbirds are go.
N: Scene change to inside Thunderbird 3.
C: GORDON
D: Check retros. Go.
C: JEFF
D: Go to maximum thrust.
N: Scene switches to the submarine.
C: THE HOOD
D: There goes the cavalry. But who will rescue the rescuers?
N: Scene changes to Alan on the beach looking up at Thunderbird 3 launching and heading toward Thunderbird 5. Tintin runs up beside him and looks up as well.
C: FERMAT
D: Alan! Tintin! Thunderbird 5 has been hit! Thunderbird 5 has been hit! Thunderbird 5 has been
N: hit!
C: ALAN
D: Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay don't panic. Don't panic.
N: The children look toward the beach when they hear a noise and see the submarine beginning to surface.
C: ALAN
D: On the other hand.
C: ALAN, FERMAT, TINTIN
D: Run!
N: The kids run and hide behind some trees and shrubs. Scene then switches to inside the submarine.
C: MULLION
D: We made land.
C: THE HOOD
D: Cut them off.
E: directed toward Transom
C: TRANSOM
D: Activating communications blackout.
N: Scene switch to Brains in Command and Control
C: BRAINS
D: What the he-he-devil is going on?
C: BRAINS
D: Mr. Tracy, do you copy?
C: BRAINS
D: Thunderbird 3 please respond.
N: Scene switch back to the kids hiding on the beach.
C: ALAN
D: How'd they find the island? Do you think it was what I did in Thunderbird 1? Do you think I ruined
N: everything?
C: FERMAT
D: No! That compound we found could have some sort of transmitting capability.
C: TINTIN
D: We have to do something.
C: FERMAT
D: My dad's in the control room, but how do we get there now?
C: ALAN
D: The vents. Let's go! We have to get a message to my dad.
N: Scene switch to Thunderbird 5
C: JOHN
D: I'm losing all power. Repeat, I'm losing all power.
C: JEFF
D: Hold on, John. We're coming in. Gordon, prepare for immediate docking.
C: GORDON
D: You got it, Dad. Reverse main thrusters on my mark. Three, two, one.
C: JEFF
D: Easy. Watch the roll.
C: VIRGIL
D: Roll index angle minus two degrees.
C: GORDON
D: We're locked on.
C: JEFF
D: Nice work
C: SCOTT
D: Tunnel hatch secured.
C: JEFF
D: Emergency packs boys. Let's move!
C: JEFF
D: We're in. Let's go!
N: Jeff, Scott, Virgil, and Gordon are now in the damaged Thunderbird 5 with John.
C: JEFF
D: John! Scott, tackle that fire.
C: JOHN
D: Am I glad to see you guys!
C: JEFF
D: Easy, you're hurt. Virgil, take care of your brother. Gordon, give me a damage assessment.
N: Scene switch to back on the island. The kids are running through the jungle while heading toward the vents and the Hood and his crew are heading toward Command and Control.
C: ALAN
D: Come on, hurry!
N: Inside the Tracy house Transom has found the closed door to Command and Control center. Using an electronic device she finds out what type of door it is.
C: TRANSOM
D: One-inch steel plate, with sequential titanium locking mechanism.
N: MULLION (Looks and door and pops his joints) I love a challenge. Scene changes to right outside the Tracy house as the kids are approaching the vents.
C: FERMAT
D: Watch out for the guards.
C: ALAN
D: Get in, get in.
N: Scene switches to Brains sitting nervously in the Command and Control room, whistling nervously to himself and reading a magazine upside down. On the other side of the door there is muffled banging from where Mullion is trying to break open the door.
C: BRAINS
D: Who-o-o-o- What's going on?
E: Door bursts open and Mullion, Transom, and the Hood walk in
C: THE HOOD
D: So, this is Mount Olympus. And these are the Thunderbirds. I should have guessed. Jeff
N: Tracy, the billionaire, ex-astronaut, of course. Isn't he the one who lost his wife in an accident? Avalanche wasn't it? How tragic. Scene switches to Alan, Tintin, and Fermat walking in the vents toward the one that leads to the Command and Control room.
C: ALAN
D: Just keep going straight ahead.
E: Whispers
C: TINTIN
D: Okay.
E: whispers
N: Scene switches back to Command and Control room.
C: TRANSOM
D: Professor Hackenbacker? We met at last year's international conference on
N: nanotechnology. I thought your thesis on neutrinos was extremely, stimulating.
C: THE HOOD
D: Transom, concentrate!
C: TRANSOM
D: Sorry, sir. The command control switch, is here. Fingerprint recognition system.
C: THE HOOD
D: Professor. Please. Activate the control switch.
C: BRAINS
D: N-n-n-n-n- You must be kidding.
C: THE HOOD
D: Professor, you and I share an interest in the science of the mind. The difference is, I was
N: born with my powers. Trust me when I tell you, you've barely touched the surface. (Brains is forced to stand up and walked over to the Hood) Even the strongest minds can be broken. It would be a pity to break yours.
C: BRAINS
D: Fu-Fu-Fu- No way!
C: THE HOOD
D: Activate the control switch, Prof! Like a puppet on
E: Uses his powers to make BRAINS move
N: a string! (laughs) Brains hand touches the activation pad.
C: TRANSOM
D: We have control.
C: MULLION
D: Get up.
E: To Brains
C: TRANSOM
D: Sorry, Professor. Nothing personal.
N: Scene briefly switches to the children's worried faces in the vents. Scene then changes back to Thunderbird 5, where the control panel is buzzing.
C: SCOTT
D: We got a warning light on our EPS system.
C: JEFF
D: Attempt manual override.
C: SCOTT
D: No, that's negative!
N: Scene switches back to Alan, Tintin, and Fermat in the vents.
C: ALAN
D: That's it.
C: FERMAT
D: Okay, this one.
N: Scene switches to Thunderbird 5.
C: JEFF
D: Back to Thunderbird 3 now. John, we gotta move.
E: turns to help an injured John
C: GORDON
D: The locking mechanism's jammed!
C: THE HOOD
D: Attention, Thunderbird 5. As you can see I have taken over your facilities. You no longer
N: control your operational systems. Scene change back to the kids in the vent. They can stick their heads out of the vent and see into the Command and Control Room, but they are hidden behind a panel and the Hood and his minions cannot see them.
C: ALAN
D: They've taken over.
C: THE HOOD
D: Warm them up, Transom.
C: TRANSOM
D: Increasing temperature to maximum.
N: The children are now looking into the Command and Control room. Kyrano and his wife, Onaha, are dragged in.
C: ALAN
D: Who's the bald freak?
C: KYRANO
D: You? The Hood uses his powers on him and he falls down clutching his head.
C: TINTIN
D: Dad!
C: FERMAT
D: They've got m-my dad.
C: JEFF
D: Okay, you have our attention. Who are you? What do you want?
C: THE HOOD
D: Oh how rude of me. You can call me The Hood. Now, listen, Mr. Tracy. We won't be
N: negotiating. I'm going to use the Thunderbirds to rob the largest banks in the world, starting with the Bank of London. The world's monetary system will be thrown into chaos and the Thunderbirds held responsible.
C: SCOTT
D: You'll never get away with it.
C: JEFF
D: Why the Thunderbirds?
C: THE HOOD
D: An eye for an eye, Mr. Tracy.
C: JEFF
D: An eye for an eye?
C: THE HOOD
D: Perhaps you've forgotten me, but surely you remember saving the life of my brother,
N: Kyrano?
C: KYRANO
D: Turns to the video phone that the Hood has been using to communicate with Thunderbird
N: I'm sorry, Mr. Tracy. I thought he was dead.
C: THE HOOD
D: Take them away.
E: Laughs and then turns to the guards
C: MULLION
D: Yes, sir.
N: The kids lift their heads back up into the vents
C: ALAN
D: Whoa.
C: TINTIN
D: That makes The Hood my uncle?
C: FERMAT
D: Every family has a black sh-sh- a black sh- (Sneezes and everyone in the Command and
N: Control room looks around, while Brains pretends that it was him that sneezed.)
C: FERMAT
D: This room's murder with my allergies.
E: Turns to look at Alan
N: The kids stick their heads back out the vent and look at what is going on in the Command and Control room.
C: THE HOOD
D: You left me to die that day. You may have broken my body but you've no idea how
N: powerful my mind has become. And now you will suffer, as I suffered, waiting for a rescue that will never come. (Makes a motion for Transom to cut off the call with Thunderbird 5.)
C: JEFF
D: Wait! Scott, status report.
E: Video link cuts dead and then the scene cuts to Thunderbird 5.
C: SCOTT
D: CO2 levels are rising.
C: JEFF
D: Alright, wire the oxygen scrubber to the emergency batteries. Clean the air.
C: VIRGIL
D: How long will that give us?
C: JOHN
D: About four hours.
N: Scene switches back to the kids looking into the Command and Control room. Fermat begins to start sneezing again. Tintin and Alan put their hands over his nose and mouth to try and muffle the sound.)
C: MULLION
D: Someone's there. (Mullion walks over to the ceiling, he is standing directly below where
N: they are. The kids are trying to leave the vents when his hand shoots up through the ceiling and grabs Alan's ankle. He lets go after Tintin bites his hand and he gasps in pain.) The children are now talking loudly and everyone in the Command and Control room can hear them.
C: TINTIN
D: Run! Run!
C: ALAN
D: No, jump! We can get through to the silos.
N: The children scream as they fall down a tunnel leading to the silos. And the scene switches to the Command and Control room.
C: THE HOOD
D: Apparently, the island is not as secure as you thought. (he looks at the old photos that were
N: on Jeff's desk. Children! Did you find any children?
C: TRANSOM
D: Here they are. Thunderbird 2 silo, in the
E: Using the security cameras to see into the silos
N: loading arm. Mullion and two other guards run off to get them
C: THE HOOD
D: Seal them in.
E: Speaking to Transom
C: ALAN
D: Hold on!
C: TINTIN
D: The doors! You guys, let's go! C'mon
C: FERMAT
D: Go! Go!
N: The children reach the door that leads to Thunderbird 3's silo just as it closes.
C: ALAN
D: This way.
E: They run toward the still closing Thunderbird 1 silo door.
C: FERMAT
D: No!
E: After the door closes before they can get through it
C: TINTIN
D: They've got us trapped. What now?
C: FERMAT
D: If we can get to the Thunderbird 1's silo, we can escape through the service tunnel. But we
N: need a plan, Alan.
C: ALAN
D: I'll use the Thunderizer on the door.
N: guards are in the elevator heading down to come get them)
C: ALAN
D: You guys get the goons with the Firefly!
C: FERMAT
D: Alan! This equipment is only to be used in an emergency. I
E: Alan and Tintin give him looks
N: guess this qualifies.
C: ALAN
D: Yeah.
C: TINTIN
D: Here they come. Fermat, can you drive this thing?
C: FERMAT
D: Uh, no.
C: TINTIN
D: Hey, watch it!
C: FERMAT
D: I took microbiology, not driver's ed. Set the pressure to maximum.
C: TINTIN
D: Got it.
C: MULLION
D: Retreat!
E: The guards walk out of the elevator and see Tintin pointing the Firefly at them
N: (They fall over and have trouble getting up due to the slipperiness of the stuff fired at them)
C: TINTIN
D: Let's move it.
C: ALAN
D: That's it. Time to thunderize. Yes!
E: After the door has a hole cut in it.
C: ALAN
D: Come on, let's go!
C: MULLION
D: Get 'em!
C: ALAN
D: Where's Fermat?
C: TINTIN
D: Fermat!
C: ALAN
D: Fermat!
C: FERMAT
D: Coming!
C: ALAN
D: Hurry up. What were you doing back there,
E: the children are now in Thunderbird 1's silo
N: Fermat?
C: FERMAT
D: I had an-n-n idea.
C: ALAN
D: Just try and keep up, okay? I'll open the tunnel. We gotta keep moving. (Alan types in a pass
N: code)
C: ALAN
D: Go back. Yell when you see them coming.
E: To Tintin and Fermat tries another pass code
N: Alan turns away from the door for a moment and the camera can see The Hood on the other side of the door. Alan turns back and sees him.
C: THE HOOD
D: Alan. You can run if you want. Were you surprised to hear what your father did to me? It is
N: frightening when we realize our parents aren't perfect. But perhaps you already suspected that about your father. Why did he build these magnificent machines? Do you suppose it was guilt? Because he let your mother die. (Alan shakes his head no) Open the door, Alan. (Alan continues to shake his head no) (The Hood chuckles at his refusal) Open, the, door. (He tries to use his powers on Alan but nothing happens)
C: ALAN
D: We can't go this way. He's there.
E: Shouting to Tintin and Fermat
N: The Hood uses his powers to open the door and Mullion and the other guards appear at the other doorway, leaving the children trapped.
C: FERMAT
D: No! Ow. What are we gonna do, Alan?
E: he falls slightly
C: ALAN
D: I don't know. I'm thinking, okay? (Alan looks at the control panel behind the Hood and sees a
N: button that will open part of the floor under Thunderbird 1. Keep backing up. I've got an idea. (Alan takes his rock launcher from the pouch it is in on the back of his pants. and fires it at the button, but misses.)
C: TINTIN
D: That's your idea?
C: THE HOOD
D: It's not me you're angry at, Alan.
C: ALAN
D: It's not you I'm aiming at. (Alan fires another rock and this time hits the button and the floor
N: drops out from underneath Tintin, Fermat, and Alan. Tintin, Fermat, and Alan scream as they fall.)
C: THE HOOD
D: Get them!
C: MULLION
D: Transom, fire up Thunderbird 1. And set it on broil!
N: The kids look behind them while they are falling down the tunnel and see the flames coming from Thunderbird 1 behind them. Tintin screams even louder. The tunnel opens up and leads to the ocean. Back in Command and Control
C: TRANSOM
D: No sign of them.
C: MULLION
D: Of course not, the little brats went up like firecrackers. Pop, pop, pop! (laughs at Brains and
N: Brains moves to punch him.)
C: THE HOOD
D: Don't, give him the satisfaction, Professor. This is taking too long. Pick out the equipment
N: you need to get into those banks and load it into Thunderbird 2. No more delays.
C: MULLION
D: Yes, sir.
N: Scene switches to the children trying to get onto the beach, they are getting knocked over by a couple of waves. Fermat is coughing and spluttering.
C: FERMAT
D: How about a little warning next time you pull a stunt like that?
C: ALAN
D: Relax, Fermat. It's just a little water.
C: FERMAT
D: I could have drowned.
C: ALAN
D: You mean you can't swim?!
C: FERMAT
D: I repeat, I could have drowned.
N: Scene switches to the boys ringing out their shirts, they are both in their boxers.
C: ALAN
D: I said I was sorry, Fermat. Just put this behind us, Okay? We gotta watch each other's backs.
N: Nice drawers.
C: FERMAT
D: Thank you.
C: TINTIN
D: Boo!
C: ALAN
D: No, c'mon Tintin, stay there.
C: TINTIN
D: You're worse than a couple of girls. Hurry up and get dressed. Those are nice
E: To Fermat
N: drawers! Scene switches to the children walking along one of the beaches.
C: FERMAT
D: Data from Tracy Island is sent to Thunderbird 5 via satellite, right?
C: ALAN
D: Right.
C: FERMAT
D: So, there's a miniscule possibility that if we reach the satellite station, we could
C: ALAN
D: Blow it up!
C: FERMAT
D: No, we could hack in to it and give control back to Thunderbird 5.
C: ALAN
D: Good thinking, Fermat. Alright, let's do it. Here's the
E: Alan starts drawing the plan in the sand
N: plan. We're here, right?. So, we go along the shore around the base of the mountain to the access road, here. And then up to the transmitter. So what do you think?
C: TINTIN
D: Good. Except that we're here, not there, and the transmitter is there, not here. We have to go
N: through the jungle.
C: FERMAT
D: But that's f-f- off limits.
C: TINTIN
D: It's gonna be dangerous.
C: ALAN
D: I'm in. We gotta get up there fast! All our folks are
E: All three of them put their hands together
N: in trouble and if The Hood gets off the island
C: FERMAT
D: Actually, he's not going anywhere for now.
C: ALAN
D: The guidance processor for Thunderbird 2. You can't take off without it. Fermat you're a genius.
N: How'd you get this?
C: FERMAT
D: Alan, my friend, what you don't know, can't hurt you.
N: Scene switches to Lady Penelope's Country Mansion in England, where Parker is out cleaning a car when the car phone rings.
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: Parker?
C: PARKER
D: Milady?
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: We have an emergency.
N: Scene switch to Lady Penelope's bathroom
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: What a charming fellow.
N: Someone knocks on the door.
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: Come in.
N: Parker enters Lady Penelope's bathroom, with tea, where she is up to her shoulders in bubble bath.
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: Have a look at this, Parker. He, and this
E: There is a computer monitor near her feet.
N: woman, poor girl, both work for this man, known as The Hood.
C: PARKER
D: Sounds like an alias, milady.
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: Quite right, Parker. Real name: Trangh Belagant. Assumed dead when
N: his illegal diamond mine collapsed in the jungles of the Malaya. (takes a sip of tea) Oh, perfect, Parker. The Thunderbirds rescued over 500 mine workers, including Mr. Belagant's brother.
C: PARKER
D: Milady, that's Mr. Tracy's loyal manservant, Kyrano.
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: How's my schedule, Parker?
C: PARKER
D: You have clay pigeon shooting with Lord Marlborough, a benefit gala for the Institute of the
N: Blind, and incidentally there's a typhoon bearing down on Singapore.
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: I suppose that's urgent.
C: PARKER
D: Yes, milady. There was also a bridge collapsed in Buenos Aires and a volcanic eruption in
N: Jakarta.
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: The Thunderbirds haven't responded?
C: PARKER
D: No, milady. And the media is awash in speculation vis-à-vis their whereabouts. Parker turns on
N: the news.
C: CHUCK
D: Over to Lisa Lowe.
C: LISA LOWE
D: Chuck, disaster after disaster around the world today and still no sight of the Thunderbirds.
N: Typhoon Jago hit land in Singapore just one hour ago and thousands have been left homeless by a volcano in Jakarta. Only the Thunderbirds have the incredible machines
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: I think it's time to send the emergency signal, Parker.
C: PARKER
D: I fear you're not wrong, milady.
C: LISA LOWE
D: Lisa Lowe. Back to you, Chuck.
N: Parker hits the top of the tea pot and a light pops out and begins to blink and beep. Back on Tracy Island a similar light begins to flash and bleep but Brains is unable to get up to get to it because he is tied up. Scene switch to the kids walking through the jungle.
C: ALAN
D: I'm telling you, Fermat, it was like The Hood was inside my head back there.
C: FERMAT
D: What do you mean, Alan?
C: ALAN
D: Maybe he can read minds or control minds or something.
C: FERMAT
D: Don't be silly, Alan. Everything can be explained by science.
C: ALAN
D: I'm just trying to figure out his weakness. Everybody has an Achilles heel, right?
C: FERMAT
D: My Achilles heel is actually my Achilles heel. It's got a blister the size of a basketball. Tintin!
N: Can we s-s-
C: TINTIN
D: Stop?
C: FERMAT
D: Yes!
C: TINTIN
D: No!
C: FERMAT
D: Okay.
E: sighs
C: ALAN
D: No more cheeseburgers for you, Fermat.
E: Helping Fermat up the hill
N: Scene change back to Lady Penelope's house.
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: Any word?
C: PARKER
D: Nothing, milady.
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: Right. You will have to tell Lord Marlborough that I've broken my shooting arm. We
N: shall send the Institute for the Blind a dozen guide dogs. And bring the car around.
C: PARKER
D: Yes, milady.
C: LADY PENELOPE
D: The Thunderbirds appear to be in a spot of trouble. And I don't like that. Let's go,
N: Parker. They get in the car and it takes off flying toward Tracy Island. Scene switches to Mullion and the Hood in the Thunderbirds hanger.
C: MULLION
D: Ready for launch. We'll use this to get into the vaults.
C: THE HOOD
D: Subtle, as usual, Mullion.
C: MULLION
D: I didn't realize we'd be getting points for style. We're robbing banks, remember.
N: The Hood uses his power on Mullion and Mullion gasps.
C: THE HOOD
D: Don't worry. You'll get your money.
C: MULLION
D: Transom, initiate pre-flight
E: Looks over toward Thunderbird 2 and speaks into headset
N: diagnostics. An alarm suddenly goes off in Thunderbird 2.
C: MULLION
D: What's going on?
C: TRANSOM
D: It's the guidance processor.
C: MULLION
D: What's wrong with it?
C: TRANSOM
D: There isn't one.
C: MULLION
D: Aaargh!
C: THE HOOD
D: Clever Alan. It's the children. They have it.
C: MULLION
D: No way. They're dead. No one could live through something like that.
C: THE HOOD
D: I did. Get them, Mullion. Take whatever you need. And make sure you get the guidance
N: processor before you lose your temper. Scene switches to the children in the jungle.
C: FERMAT
D: Alan, don't you think Tintin is blossoming?
C: ALAN
D: Blossoming?! What's that supposed to mean?
C: FERMAT
D: Come on, Alan. You've a c-crush on her.
C: ALAN
D: You've got to be kidding. I mean, she's. She's not that bad, I guess.
C: TINTIN
D: Okay, guys, take five.
E: Reaches the top of the mountain
C: FERMAT
D: Five isn't going to do it!
E: Still finishing climbing up the mountain
C: TINTIN
D: Guys?
N: Alan and Fermat reach the top of the mountain, they are both puffing and panting. Tintin smiles at them before she sees a scorpion on Alan's shoulder.
C: TINTIN
D: Don't move.
C: FERMAT
D: Whoa
E: Sees scorpion when he stands up next to Alan
C: ALAN
D: What is it?
C: TINTIN
D: Hexdrotilous scorpion.
C: ALAN
D: Is that dangerous?
C: FERMAT
D: .025 milligrams of its venom is fatal.
C: ALAN
D: So, dangerous is in fact an understatement.
N: Tintin uses powers just like her uncle, The Hood, to lift the scorpion off of Alan's shoulder and lets it fall to the ground.
C: FERMAT
D: Watch out!
C: ALAN
D: Tintin, what was that?
C: TINTIN
D: Let's get going.
C: ALAN
D: Hey! She has the same powers as her uncle, The Hood.
C: FERMAT
D: You think?
C: ALAN
D: Must run in the family. Did you do that?
C: TINTIN
D: Just drop it, okay?
C: ALAN
D: Still think everything can be explained by science?
C: FERMAT
D: Not girls!
N: Scene cuts to Thunderbird 5 where there is an alarm and then an explosion near Scott and Gordon.
C: JEFF
D: Scott? Gordon? You all right?
C: GORDON
D: We're okay.
C: SCOTT
D: The heat exchanger has blown.
C: JEFF
D: You don't say.
N: Scene switches back to Mullion and two other guards searching the jungle for Alan, Tintin, and Fermat.
C: MULLION
D: Come on! Those brats are in here somewhere.
N: Scene change to the kids at the satellite transmitter.
C: ALAN
D: How we doing Fermat?
C: FERMAT
D: Don't rush me Alan. This is very d-delicate equipment. Which is
E: The circuit board sparks.
N: now b-b-broken.
C: ALAN
D: Can you fix it?
C: FERMAT
D: Yea- Maybe, but I'll need something to solder with.
C: ALAN
D: We're in the middle of nowhere Fermat, where are you going to find something like that. (Tintin
N: and Fermat see Alan's retainer and share a look) What? Alan yells as Tintin and Fermat pull out the metal part of Alan's retainer.
C: ALAN
D: Ow!
C: FERMAT
D: Perfect.
C: TINTIN
D: Gee Alan, I never figured you for a crybaby.
C: ALAN
D: I'm gonna kill you.
C: FERMAT
D: What'd he say?
C: TINTIN
D: I think it was some sort of apology.
C: FERMAT
D: I got it, yes! Y-y-you the man, Fermat! Okay, first step is to establish contact with Thunderbird
N: Scene switch to Thunderbird 5
C: ALAN
D: Dad?
C: JOHN
D: It's Alan!
C: JEFF
D: Alan, where are you? Are you safe?
C: ALAN
D: I'm at the satellite relay station with Fermat and Tintin. Fermat's gonna hack into the main
N: computer system and give control of Thunderbird 5 back to you.
C: JEFF
D: We're standing by.
C: FERMAT
D: Okay, we're almost there.
N: Scene switches to Command and Control room with Transom and Brains.
C: TRANSOM
D: Goodness me, Professor. You're so good-looking without your glasses on. I think you may
N: find that's another thing we have in common. Pretty? (She leans in to kiss him, but an alarm sounds at the control panel)
C: TRANSOM
D: Oh now that's not fair. Just when things were starting to sizzle.
C: TRANSOM
D: A burst of transmission from the island's satellite station.
E: To the Hood as he walks in
N: Should I jam it?
C: THE HOOD
D: And give Mullion the coordinates.
N: Scene switches to Mullion and the two guards in a car. Transom is communicating with him through his headset.
C: TRANSOM
D: Take the main track southeast, then head up Satellite Hill.
N: Scene switches back to the kids at the satellite station.
C: FERMAT
D: They're onto us! We're being jammed!
C: ALAN
D: Can you finish?
C: FERMAT
D: I'll try.
C: JEFF
D: Alan, what's happening?
E: Through the video phone
C: ALAN
D: Hang in there Dad, one more minute, okay?
C: FERMAT
D: It's not going to work Alan. The signal's too weak for data transmission.
C: ALAN
D: Dad, can you hear me? They're jamming the signal. We're going to lose you. Don't worry, I'll
N: take care of everything, okay?
C: JEFF
D: That's a negative! It's too dangerous. Follow emergency procedure. Wait for Lady Penelope at the
N: rendezvous point. Alan can you read me? (the screen begins to break up)
C: ALAN
D: Dad!
C: JEFF
D: Alan we're losing you! Alan!
C: ALAN
D: Dad!
N: Alan throws the video phone
C: FERMAT
D: No!
C: ALAN
D: Useless!
C: FERMAT
D: It is now.
C: TINTIN
D: I'm sorry, Alan. This is hard on all of us.
C: ALAN
D: No, it's okay. I'm fine.
C: FERMAT
D: You don't have to be such a tough guy Alan. I'm worried about my dad too.
C: TINTIN
D: I'd do anything to be with my parents right now.
C: ALAN
D: But The Hood knows we're alive now. We have to go.
C: FERMAT
D: Even worse, they know exactly
N: Tires screech and Mullion and the guards appear.
C: FERMAT
D: Where we are!
N: Mullion and the other guards watch the kids running down the hillside for a second.
C: MULLION
D: Come on!
N: The kids fall down a ditch screaming and into a river.
C: FERMAT
D: Great, more water.
C: ALAN
D: Tintin, can you slow 'em down?
C: TINTIN
D: I'd be delighted.
C: ALAN
D: Then do it. And meet us at the junk yard. Come on, Fermat.

C: FERMAT
D: It's gonna make this thing hard to control you know.
C: ALAN
D: No problem.
C: FERMAT
D: You really must be careful not to exceed four bars of boost or else
C: ALAN
D: I said no problem.
C: TINTIN
D: Guys, let's go we've got to get out of here. What is this?
C: FERMAT
D: It's a hoversled.
C: ALAN
D: It's our ticket out, unless you've got a better idea.
C: TINTIN
D: Yeah, let's wait for Lady Penelope, like your dad said.
C: FERMAT
D: Here.
E: Hands Tintin the seat to the hoversled
C: ALAN
D: Great plan. Let's sit and wait to get caught. I say we do something. Now! Right, Fermat?
C: FERMAT
D: Actually, I agree with Tintin. I don't think this is s-s-safe.
C: ALAN
D: You don't think anything is s s-safe.
C: FERMAT
D: Just because I s-s-stutter doesn't mean that I'm wrong. If we're a team, we should make
N: decisions as a team.
C: ALAN
D: Do you guys want to sit here and take a vote? Or do you want to get out of here? Cuz I'm going.
C: TINTIN
D: You can be a real jerk sometimes.
N: Scene changes to Mullion looking up and seeing the kids escaping on the hoversled.

D: Alan! You're going too fast!
C: ALAN
D: I need more speed to get above the trees. Hang on!

C: JEFF
D: Stop it!
C: GORDON
D: Come on, Dad. The situation's hopeless.
C: JEFF
D: No, it's not. There's still time. We've got people on the ground working for us.
C: GORDON
D: Alan? He's just a kid!
