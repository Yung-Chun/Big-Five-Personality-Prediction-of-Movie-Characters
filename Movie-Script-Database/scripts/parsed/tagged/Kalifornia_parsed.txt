M: SHOOTING DRAFT
S: EXT. - NIGHT
N: It's raining like hell. Flashes of lightning reveal momentary glimpses of a decayed urban/industrial landscape. Far below us, a mysterious glistening wet rock lies engulfed in the drowning earth. We descend toward the rock. Sporadic flashes of lightning distort our perspective of the stone. It looks strangely beautiful, like a diamond stuck in the dark mud... Closer... Closer... Suddenly, STRONG MALE HANDS cut across the frame and wrench it free from its muddy grave. Even closer... And we discover that the underbelly of this beautiful rock is teeming with every kind of slithering repulsive insect... FLASH!!* Lightning obliterates the frame. (* FLASHES OF LIGHT from lightning, car headlights, photographic strobe units and flashlights are used throughout the following sequences as recurring transitional devices.)
S: CITY STREET EXT. NIGHT
N: We can barely see the darkened street in a run down part of an inner city -- what we can see looks half demolished. Flash!! Through chain link fencing, the blinding headlights of a 70'S CHEVY arc into frame. For an instant we see the fleeting image of a PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL. On her feet a pair of bright red high heeled shoes. The Chevy pulls up next to her.
S: INT. 70'S CHEVY - NIGHT
N: FLASH!! An oncoming car's headlights streak across the beat up Chevy's windshield... revealing... THE DRIVER, 45ish, as he leans across the passenger seat and opens the car door. The pretty teenage girl slides into the car. Dressed only in a skirt and T-Shirt, she's soaked to the skin. Make-up runs down her face and her hair sticks to her bare shoulders. She seems nervous... scared even.
C: PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
D: Thanks.
N: As she closes the car door the man notices that her hand has been injured. It's bound with coarse white toweling and stained with blood. In her other hand, she clings tightly to a cheap yellow leather purse. He reaches forward and puts his hand on the gear-shift, the back of his hand brushing against her leg, she moves away. He slides the gear-shift into drive. Another car's headlights flare the windshield as he pulls out into the night.
S: INT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
N: Suddenly... a powerful photographic strobe light ignites! Revealing a decrepit warehouse interior. Silhouetted briefly against the paint chipped walls are two figures: A man, BRIAN KESSLER, 25, short chopped hair dressed in black on black, and a woman, CARRIE LAUGHLIN, 25, short black hair and tight black clothes. Carrie holds a 35mm still camera, an umbilical cord runs to a strobe light. Brian holds a flashlight in one hand, a tape recorder in the other. He begins speaking into the tape recorder.
C: BRIAN
D: Her father worked the night shift here. Most nights he'd bring her with him. She was eleven years old.
E: pause
N: His flashlight scans the ominous environment. Carrie takes flash photo.
S: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT
N: Emerging from the blackness... The same strong male hands that unearthed the rock now pulls his rain soaked jacket clear of his torso. A crude bandage wrapped around one of the fingers. The rock is slipped up under his jacket... up against his bare chest. The jacket is pulled down to conceal the rock and the faceless figure drifts away.
S: INT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
N: The beam of Brian's flashlight sweeps through the darkness, revealing another room.
C: BRIAN
D: This is it. This is the where he'd take her whenever he had the urge to molest her.
N: The flashlight finds the corner in question. Flash!! The warehouse lights up again, revealing a huge machine room.
C: BRIAN
D: Of course! Nobody would have heard her cries over the noise of the machines.
S: INT. 70'S CHEVY - NIGHT
N: A male hand wipes the steamy condensation clear of his car's front window. The windshield wipers swipe incessantly at the constant sheet of rain beyond.
C: DRIVER
D: Damn! This defroster never works...
N: The driver fidgets blindly with the various levers and knobs. He finally manages to get the defroster and heater to work. The girl leans forward into the stream of warm air.
C: PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
D: ...Mmm... feels good.
N: She closes her eyes, lets it blow across her face. He watches her. His eyes linger on her body.
C: DRIVER
D: Have a problem with your car?
N: She pulls her wet hair off her bruised face and gives him a nervous smile.
C: PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
D: No. My problem's with men.
E: beat
N: He throws a curious look at her, then back to the highway.
S: INT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
N: Brian's flashlight moves around the room.
C: BRIAN
D: This is where she murdered her first victim. They found his body over in the corner, shot through the head.
N: The flashlight continues to search through the darkness.
C: BRIAN
D: They found her second victim over there.
N: Another flash!!!!!
S: INT. 70'S CHEVY
N: Very close on the girl's yellow purse... as the metal zipper is pulled open. The driver notices her opening the purse.
C: PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
D: Okay if I smoke?
C: DRIVER
D: ...sure.
E: unconvincingly
N: The driver watches as she reaches into the purse... out a soggy pack of matches. She looks at them... I look to the driver.
C: PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
D: My matches are all wet. You got a lighter?
C: DRIVER
D: Yeah. It's here somewhere. It's my wife's car. Ah... there it is.
E: scans the dashboard
N: He pushes the cigarette lighter in to heat. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees the girl's hand slip back in her purse. And stay there. She stares at the car lighter and... waits. The driver glances at her, then back to the lighter.
S: INT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE
N: FLASH!! As another strobe light ignites. Tape recorder hand, Brian continues...
C: BRIAN
D: She lured them here with the promise of sex. Imagine the anger and hatred she must have felt returning to this place. Did she use that to help her pull the trigger?
E: beat
N: Carrie snaps another shot. Flash!! The blinding flash illuminates the night rain streaming in through the fractured remains of the ceiling.
C: CARRIE
D: Shhhhhhhhh.
N: Brian stops talking. Carrie scans the darkness. From the quiet... A Thunderous Roar!!
S: INT. 70'S CHEVY - NIGHT
N: A Blinding Flash!! As... a semi-trailer crosses paths with the 70'S CHEVY. Close on the girl. An intent expression on her face as she watches and waits... for the cigarette lighter to eject. His hand reaches deeper into her purse. The Driver tenses as he sees this. Suddenly... POP!! The lighter ejects. The Driver reaches for the dash. The girl hurriedly lifts something out from inside the bag. The Driver yanks the lighter out... and whips a look to the girl.
S: INT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE
N: Brian's flashlight sweeps across the shadowed remains of the rafters and catwalks. Scanning... Listening... Brian and Carrie glance tentatively at each other... Then slowly Carrie lifts the portable strobe unit upward until it is pointing into the rafters. Carrie fires a shot, triggering a brilliant Flash!!
T: CUT TO:
N: Flash! Out of the inky black... The glistening wet rock emerges, hurtling downwards... Tumbling end over end through the night rain...
S: INT. 70'S CHEVY
N: The girl pulls a pack of cigarettes out of her purse. She looks curiously to the driver whose hand is trembling slightly.
C: PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
D: What's the matter?
C: DRIVER
D: ...nothing.
E: unconvincingly
N: The girl reaches out, steadies his trembling hand... and pulls the red hot coil to the cigarette between her lips. When... in a THUNDEROUS CRASH!! The glistening wet rock comes smashing through their windshield!!!!
S: EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT
N: The CHEVY brakes... Skids across the rain-slicked pavement and turns a somersault, landing upside down on its hood. ANOTHER ANGLE: CLOSER The CAMERA DRIFTS ACROSS the fractured front end of the overturned CHEVY. The twisted hunk of metal hisses... steams... groans. The front tire spins lazily to a halt on its mangled axle. IN THE BACKGROUND - HIGH OVERHEAD We see a man standing on a highway overpass. He's leaning on the railing and calmly looking down at the wrecked car. CLOSER EARLY GRAYCE, 25, athletic build, big watery eyes, jet black hair, stands by the railing. Rain streaks down his expressionless face. He dropped the rock. EARLY'S POV - THE 70'S CHEVY Lying in the deserted highway. The Driver crawls out covered with blood. Still clutched in his hand is the car cigarette lighter. Its red hot coil extinguishing quickly to a faint glow. ANGLE: CLOSER ON EARLY Calmly looking down with no pity. Even closer... Water running down his face. Closer yet... On his eye... And right into the dilated pupil. As we enter it -- it's like being in a dark winding tunnel filled with the hum of dynamos and the loud rhythmic pumping of powerful machinery. FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE BLACKNESS The distant echo of a Woman's voice.
C: KIM
D: Are you dead or alive?
E: O.S.
S: INT. APARTMENT - BRIAN'S EAR - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Still hearing the whine from some tremendous dynamo, we emerge from the inside of BRIAN'S RIGHT EARDRUM, pulling back far enough to see his face.
C: KIM
D: Brian?
E: O.S.
N: Brian is distracted, distant, not paying attention to the game of "Twenty Questions" that he is playing.
C: BRIAN
D: Dead.
C: KIM
D: Obviously!
E: O.S. sarcastic
N: NEW ANGLE A small party in progress. Graduate student types, smoking, drinking. The usual. Carrie and Brian stand out in this group, their look is more stylized, their attitude less complacent. Carrie, in particular, looks restless.
C: CARL
D: Man or woman?
C: BRIAN
D: Man.
N: Carrie tunes in and pays attention to the game.
C: CLAUDIA
D: Real or fictional.
C: BRIAN
D: Real.
C: CARRIE
D: Ted Bundy.
N: Brian's eyes dart to Carrie. The look on his face tells everyone she nailed it. Brian gets up to get another drink. Several people laugh, amazed that Carrie knows Brian so well.
C: CLAUDIA
D: What a guess!
C: CARL
D: Doesn't count, she's disqualified.
C: CARRIE
D: Why?
C: CARL
D: Because you've been living with him, and his thesis for the last year and a half. He's probably been researching Ted Bundy all week.
E: beat
C: PETER
D: Carl, you are the world's worst loser!
N: Carl looks over to Carrie. She gives him the finger and a cheeky smile. CAROL, sitting next to Carrie, asks...
C: CAROL
D: Any word from that gallery?
C: CARRIE
D: Not yet.
C: CAROL
D: Nervous?
C: CARRIE
D: ...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
C: CAROL
D: You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed to leave?
E: nods toward Brian
N: Carrie watches Brian disappear into another room.
C: CARRIE
D: ...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
C: CAROL
D: Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
N: Carrie lights a cigarette. Her frustration is showing.
C: CARRIE
D: Yeah, well Brian's got 'til the end of the summer, then I'm outta here.
N: She gets up and begins weaving her way through the crowded room. Carol follows.
C: CAROL
D: I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.
C: CARRIE
D: Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em... Like fer shurr!
E: does a valley- girl/beach bunny
N: Carrie and Carol share a strained laugh. Sequence omitted from original script.
S: INT. APARTMENT KITCHEN - FEW MOMENTS LATER
N: The room's crowded with people. There's a lot of noise -- "shop talk," banter. Clipped conversations overlap, as we find Brian with his friend Eric. They are in the midst of making a blender of margaritas.
C: BRIAN
D: I'm talking about the mind and culpability of a serial killer. Someone who has no ability to distinguish between right and wrong should not be imprisoned, let alone executed.
N: Eric dumps in a handful of ice cubes as Brian pours in the booze.
C: ERIC
D: Oh, here we go again. Let's just lay it all at the altar of misfiring synapses, amok biochemicals and horrendous childhoods.
C: BRIAN
D: Look, it's a fact, most of these people suffer from a severe chemical brain imbalance. That enough Tequila?
E: beat
C: ERIC
D: Probably not...
N: Brian pours in the rest of the bottle.
C: BRIAN
D: The answer is research and treatment under hospital supervised conditions, not the electric chair!
E: to Eric
N: Eric looks for triple sec in the cupboards. PETER overhears them on his way to the refrigerator.
C: PETER
D: Yeah, until it's your mother's head they find in the refrigerator.
N: He pulls open the refrigerator door and grabs two beers. Carrie steps up behind Brian.
C: BRIAN
D: Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
C: CARRIE
D: Thank god!
N: Brian turns to see Carrie now behind him. She wraps her arms around his neck.
C: BRIAN
D: Ha, ha.
E: sarcastic to Carrie
C: ERIC
D: Yeah, but it'd sure make you feel better, wouldn't it?
C: BRIAN
D: No, it wouldn't make me feel better.
N: Peter finds triple sec in the refrigerator.
C: PETER
D: ...Looking for this?
N: Eric takes the triple sec from Peter and pours some in the blender. He turns it on. It whines.
C: CARRIE
D: If I have to listen to one more "tweed" talk about his dissertation, I'm going to throw up.
E: to Brian
C: ERIC
D: Label it anyway you want, the bottom line is these people are evil, plain and simple.
E: to Brian
C: BRIAN
D: Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.
E: continuing with Eric
C: CARRIE
D: Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
C: BRIAN
D: A... I gotta go.
E: reconsiders
S: EXT. LUCKY STREET GRILL
N: A relic from the fifties with large glass windows. The rain has stopped but the streets are still wet. Early's piece of shit Grand Prix pulls into the lot. He gets out and walks into the diner.
S: INT. DINER - NIGHT
N: The place is almost empty. Early, still wet from the rain, walks to the counter and sits down. He calls out to the kitchen.
C: EARLY
D: Coffee and a bowl of chili, please.
C: WAITRESS
D: ...Be right there.
E: O.S.
N: The only other customer is an OLD MAN, sitting at the counter nearby nursing a cup of coffee. His face half hidden under a rain soaked hat. Early selects a tune from the countertop juke box. OLD MAN'S POV Out of the corner of his eye he sees a bug (from the concrete block) crawl out of Early's sleeve and onto the counter.
C: OLD MAN
D: The Antichrist'll be a woman, in a man's body. Seven heads and seven tails.
E: from beneath his shadowy brim...
N: Early gazes at the Old Man curiously, then calls out to the waitress...
C: EARLY
D: Make that to go.
N: Early notices the small bug crawling across the counter. He leans closer to it and watches it. After a moment, he THWACKS it off the counter with his thumb and finger. The bug lands on the hot iron griddle with a SIZZLE! EARLY glances at the Old Man again... then scoots over one stool closer to him. Early seems curious to want to get a glimpse under the brim of the Old Man's hat. IN THE BACK KITCHEN AREA The waitress is bagging Early's order to go... when the front door slams shut! FRONT DINING AREA The waitress re-enters the room. It's empty. Neither the Old Man nor Early are there. With Early's food in hand, she makes her way along the rear of the counter toward the front door. She glances around curiously. On the griddle, the remains of something black and charred smoulders. Closer to the entrance, she stares at the front door. The sign that hangs in its window has been turned... the backside which faces her reads "OPEN." AT THE FRONT DOOR She wonders about the sign for a moment, then stares curiously out the window... not a soul in sight. She locks the door and begins closing up for the night. She turns to make her way to the rear of the diner then notices something. Slowly she moves along the side wall, past a number of highbacked booths. HER POV Sitting on one of the funky old leather seats in a booth are a pair of RED HIGH HEELED SHOES (the same pair worn earlier by the Pretty Teenage Girl). The Waitress glances nervously about the interior. No one in sight. AT THE BOOTH She reaches down slowly and picks up the pair of shoes. Looks at them closely. Stares at the inside lining. Then suddenly out of the quiet... a voice.
C: EARLY
D: ...Size 6.
N: The Waitress spins a startled look to the booth beyond hers! Early leans out from behind the highback partition.
C: EARLY
D: That's right ain't it, size 6?
N: The Waitress... smiles, nods shyly.
C: EARLY
D: Happy birthday Adele.
C: ADELE
D: Early, you are so sweet.
N: This is ADELE CORNERS. She's 17, pretty, uneducated and Early's girlfriend. She steps over to him, gives him a kiss, then sits down on the seat across from him. She starts to try on her new shoes.
C: ADELE
D: I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
C: EARLY
D: Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
N: She passes the bag to Early. He digs in. Between bites, he glances over to Adele who's enthusiastically pulling on the new shoes.
S: INT. BRIAN AND CARRIE'S LOFT APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: A door swings open spilling light into a darkened room. Brian and Carrie, a little drunk, return home from the party. Their apartment is in an old converted industrial building in a funky low rent part of town. Brian walks ahead, Carrie trails behind him, peeling off her clothes. She begins unzipping her dress, unnoticed by Brian.
C: BRIAN
D: Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
C: CARRIE
D: The party?
N: She grabs a leather cap that sits on a chair.
C: BRIAN
D: The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
C: CARRIE
D: It was definitely the high point of the evening.
N: Carrie's dress falls to the floor.
C: BRIAN
D: Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
E: getting excited
C: CARRIE
D: Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
N: Brian is at the foot of the bed, he turns to see... Carrie has transformed. She has stripped down to her black bra and panties, fishnet stockings, a nightporter style leather cap. A surprised Brian stands there a moment. Looking at Carrie. She looks great. Carrie pushes Brian back onto the bed. Carrie climbs on top of him. She kisses his neck. Slowly starts working her lips across his chest and down his stomach.
S: EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - MORNING
N: A solitary trailer sits alongside a run down house.
S: INT. EARLY'S TRAILER - MORNING
N: Through the soot tinged atmosphere, sunlight filters in past the curtained windows. Early is lying face down in bed, his right arm extended over the side. Adele is in the kitchen half dressed, and unsuccessfully attempting to iron one of Early's shirts. She realizes the iron is out of water, she sets it down and steps to the sink and fills a glass with water. As she does she glances at a cactus on the counter.
C: ADELE
D: You thirsty Lucy?
N: She waters her small cactus (Lucy).
C: ADELE
D: Bet that feels good, don't it?
N: NEW ANGLE - THE REFRIGERATOR Adele smiles then notices that a photo held to the fridge by a decorative magnet has fallen to the floor. She picks it up.
C: ADELE
D: Now if that ain't Momma's little angel.
N: Adele puts it back onto the fridge. It is a photo of a young Early with his mother. In the photo Early appears to be about ten or eleven. he stands next to his mother. Her arm is draped over his shoulders, she is holding a drink. A cigarette butt dangles between her fingers. Nearby a portable radio is tuned to music, when the local radio jingle comes on and segues to the news. NEW ANGLE ON EARLY A handkerchief bandana is tied around his head and over his eyes. The NEWSCASTER'S voice gets louder.
C: NEWSCASTER
D: ...two more victims last night, when a twenty pound rock smashed through the windshield of their car...
E: O.S.
N: CLOSER - EARLY'S FACE Slowly he reaches to his face and lifts the bandana up off one eye. Even closer on his left eyelid. It flutters... pops open and blinks. Now... his eyeball stares right at us. The pitch black pupil contracts in the morning light. The newscaster's voice continues to amplify...
C: NEWSCASTER
D: This was the third such attack in the past month and while an extensive police operation is underway... no arrests have yet been made.
N: The newscaster's voice quickly fades away. Early calmly closes his eyes and drifts back to sleep.
S: EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - LATE MORNING
N: Early emerges from the trailer drinking a bottle of beer. He looks around the yard, it's full of various kinds of useless junk. He walks over to his car. Adele appears in the doorway of the trailer in her bathrobe.
C: ADELE
D: Early...
N: She glances around to make certain that no one's looking, then 'flashes' her body to Early with a giggle.
C: ADELE
D: Have a good one.
N: Early smiles. Adele turns back into the trailer then, remembers...
C: ADELE
D: Oh... I forgot to tell you, Mr. Diebold was by again yesterday.
N: Early looks at the run down house next door where Diebold lives. A beat up red pick-up is parked in front.
C: ADELE
D: He said, if he ain't got the rest of his money by the end of the month, he's gonna "kick us the... F-U-C-K outta here."
E: spells the word fuck to avoid saying it
N: Early works his jaw, thinking.
C: EARLY
D: He said that, huh? Cursed in front of you?
N: Adele nods.
C: ADELE
D: You gonna talk to him?
N: Early gets in his car.
C: EARLY
D: If he comes back, don't answer the door.
N: Early revs the raspy engine.
C: ADELE
D: Suppose he hears me inside?
N: Adele's words are unheard as Early pulls away flinging his beer bottle at a couple of chained PITBULLS in Diebold's front yard. Sequence omitted from original script.
S: INT. BRIAN AND CARRIE'S LOFT - AFTERNOON
N: Brian enters the darkened loft interior.
C: BRIAN
D: I picked up some Chinese. Did you hear from the gallery?
N: Brian turns the corner, he's immediately greeted by a series of erotic images being projected on the far wall. They are slides of Carrie's photographic work. In regard to the nature and content of Carrie's photographic work, her photographs address the sexual collision of opposites. "What if's." The subjects of her photographs are hypothetical and highly unlikely partners. Studies in contract. Moments of passion.
C: BRIAN
D: You got your slides back.
E: tentative
N: From across the room, he hears Carrie's disembodied voice. He drifts toward the couch.
C: CARRIE
D: Yeah, same old shit. Too graphic... not suitable for mass consumption... one of those... I forget. Who cares.
N: Brian finds her slumped down on the couch. He sits down. She's got a drink in her hand. A bottle on her lap. She continues to click through the slides. As she rambles on, it's obvious that she's definitely under the influence of something 90 proof.
C: CARRIE
D: Christ Brian I'm dying here... you are too, you just don't know it yet. You're too busy working on that damned thesis... And, thing is... when you finally do finish it, it's just gonna get filed away on some shelf at the University Library... then what?
N: Brian can see she's upset. Drowsy from the booze. He just watches her. Listens. Her words linger in his head.
C: CARRIE
D: I thought you wanted to be a writer.
E: continues
C: BRIAN
D: ...I do.
E: quietly
C: CARRIE
D: Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
C: BRIAN
D: Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
C: CARRIE
D: No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
C: BRIAN
D: ...just like that?
C: CARRIE
D: Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.
N: The bold graphic sexual photographs of Carrie's continue to accentuate her comments.
C: CARRIE
D: That's half the kick anyway. Doing something you've never done before. Experiencing something... different. Something... unpredictable.
N: Brian notices an envelope on the floor nearby. He picks it up. Opens it. Inside, he finds the photographs Carrie took at the warehouse. Interested, he shuffles through them. He becomes more and more intrigued with what he sees.
C: BRIAN
D: ...These are great.
N: He glances over to Carrie... she's fallen asleep. He reaches over and quietly pulls the drink glass from her hand.
S: EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Early's Grand Prix has a head of steam up as it tears across the drive and hangs a hard right into his parking space next to the trailer. Suddenly, Early hits the brakes hard! Another car is parked there.
S: INT. EARLY'S TRAILER
N: Early spills through the doorway.
C: EARLY
D: Adele, who's car's that out...
N: Early spots his PAROLE OFFICER standing in the bedroom area snooping around. He has a prosthetic hand which he uses to search through Early's things.
C: PAROLE OFFICER
D: She's not here.
N: The Parole Officer hiccups throughout the scene.
C: EARLY
D: What are you doin' here? I ain't supposed to be at the Parole Office 'til tomorrow, two o'clock.
N: Early notices the man looking through some of his letters and papers.
C: PAROLE OFFICER
D: Social call.
N: The Parole Officer opens one of the closet doors, pilfers through things inside, as if searching for something. Early is getting pissed off but says nothing.
C: PAROLE OFFICER
D: You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
C: EARLY
D: Wasn't my fault...
N: He lifts his crudely bandaged middle finger.
C: EARLY
D: ...It was dangerous there and they treated me like shit.
N: Parole Officer steps over to the refrigerator, opens it, snoops around inside.
C: PAROLE OFFICER
D: Yeah... Well you never have been 'treated right'... Have you? Your father was pickin' on you when he threw you out of the house for stealing the tires off his truck. The Marines misunderstood you when they gave you that dishonorable discharge.
E: swallows a hiccup hiccup
N: He finishes with the refrigerator and continues his search through the drawers and cabinets of the trailer.
C: PAROLE OFFICER
D: ...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
E: hiccup
C: EARLY
D: I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
N: The Parole Officer ignores the question. He steps up to a sink overflowing with dirty dishes.
C: PAROLE OFFICER
D: That girlfriend of yours ain't much for housekeeping, is she.
N: Early dismisses the place with a glance.
C: EARLY
D: I'm thinking about moving...
N: Early opens the refrigerator, grabs a bottle of beer.
C: EARLY
D: Maybe down to Texas... Probably get some work on them offshore oil rigs. Hear the pay's good... hell, the weather's got to be better'n here.
N: Early sits down at the table. The Parole Officer steps over to him.
C: PAROLE OFFICER
D: What are you talking about? You know you can't leave the state. What you can do is get a job.
E: hiccup
N: The Parole Officer pulls a slip of paper from his shirt pocket, sets it on the table.
C: PAROLE OFFICER
D: You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
C: EARLY
D: What is it?
C: PAROLE OFFICER
D: ...Janitor's job.
C: EARLY
D: Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.
N: Early lifts his beer for another drink. The Parole Officer's prosthetic hand snaps tight around the neck of the beer bottle, just inches from Early's lips.
C: PAROLE OFFICER
D: Hey, I don't give two shits about what you want or don't want... I'm telling you to be there Friday, three o'clock sharp or the sheriff will be here for dinner. You understand?
N: With that Early looks up at the man, almost defiantly, then stands up. The Parole Officer hiccups again. Early stares at him for a moment.
C: EARLY
D: You oughta think about putting a bag over your head... Might cure them hiccups.
N: The Parole Officer shakes his head in disgust and walks out of the trailer to his car. Sequence omitted from original script. BRIAN'S DESK IN ANOTHER PART OF LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT Brian's in the midst of working his way through pages and pages of thesis notes scattered atop his desk. Using chopsticks he shovels Chinese straight out of the carton as he studies Carrie's warehouse photographs. CARRIE'S POV As we approach Brian from behind, moving closer, closer. NEW ANGLE - BRIAN'S DESK Carrie steps up behind him. She's rubbing her eyes, having just awakened. A hangover beckons. Brian notices her.
C: BRIAN
D: Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.
C: CARRIE
D: Thanks. What are you doing?
C: BRIAN
D: Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing.
N: Carrie grabs his container of Chinese and takes a few bites. Listens.
C: CARRIE
D: So how's it going?
C: BRIAN
D: ...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
N: Carrie glances over his shoulder at his writing.
C: BRIAN
D: ...and I think I know why.
C: CARRIE
D: Why?
C: BRIAN
D: Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
C: CARRIE
D: This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
E: sarcastic
C: BRIAN
D: Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
C: CARRIE
D: A book on the warehouse murders?
C: BRIAN
D: A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it.
N: Brian reaches down to the floor and pulls a large map of the United States up and lays it out on his desk. He traces a route West. Along the way, specific locations have been circled.
C: BRIAN
D: What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California. "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
E: pause
C: CARRIE
D: It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
C: BRIAN
D: We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out.
N: Carrie steps up to Brian.
C: BRIAN
D: ...It's either the best idea I've had in a long time... or there's way too much MSG in this stuff.
N: Brian looks at the container of Chinese in his hand. Carrie takes it from him, sets it down on the road map. Kisses him.
S: EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - DAWN
N: Early exits the trailer and climbs into his Grand Prix.
S: INT. GRAND PRIX
N: Early tries to get the engine to tick over. Then... He sees JOHN DIEBOLD, his landlord, emerge from his house and begin lumbering toward the Grand Prix. The two panting ugly-ass pitbulls trot alongside their master.
C: DIEBOLD
D: Hold on a minute there boy!
E: shouts
C: EARLY
D: Shit!
N: Early tries the engine again. Still won't start. Diebold, getting closer. The dogs are barking.
C: DIEBOLD
D: Goddamit, you're gonna settle up that rent here and now.
N: Hurriedly, Early tries the engine one more time. It starts. Grinning from ear to ear, Early pulls away before Diebold and his dogs reach him. Pissed, Diebold grabs a rock and hurls it, hitting Early's car. The car stops, dead in its tracks.
C: DIEBOLD
D: I've had it with your bullshit boy. I want my money.
S: INT. GRAND PRIX
N: Early looks in the rear-view mirror and sees... Diebold standing there confrontational. Early throws the gearshift into reverse...
S: EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER
N: Tires screeching, the car surges toward Diebold and the dogs. Scared shitless... Diebold begins back peddling. Confused, the pitbulls bark, then follow suit. Early laughs as he stalks Diebold. Diebold jumps out of the way of the Grand Prix just as it pulverizes his portable barbecue. Early shifts it into drive and barrels out of the drive. NEW ANGLE - DIEBOLD As soon as the Grand Prix is out of sight...
C: DIEBOLD
D: You sonofabitch! Come back here!
E: hollering
N: Furious, he turns to find Adele staring at him from the window of her trailer.
C: DIEBOLD
D: That's it! You tell him... I want you both the fuck out of here by Sunday or I'm gonna call the Police.
N: Adele starts laughing, she tries to hide it with her hand.
C: DIEBOLD
D: ...You won't be laughing come Sunday little girl.
N: Muttering to himself, he turns back toward his house. He then notices what Adele is laughing at. One pitbull is trying to hump the other.
C: DIEBOLD
D: Elvis! Get the fuck off him!
N: NEW ANGLE - ADELE Peering out at him from the trailer window laughing at the dogs.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - UNIVERSITY
N: Brian pulls up in his BLACK '62 LINCOLN CONTINENTAL. The suicide doors and leather interior have seen better days. Brian locks his car and walks into the building.
S: INT. LOBBY OF THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - AFTERNOON
N: Brian steps up to a large bulletin board. He sees several 'Ride-Share' notes to various cities on the board. He pins a Ride-Share note onto the board. We see the note is headlined in red - "CALIFORNIA"
C: CAROL
D: You know, they say one of these days...
N: Brian glances over his shoulder.
C: BRIAN
D: ...the whole thing's going to slide into the ocean... Yeah, I know.
E: sarcastic
N: Carol peers over Brian's shoulder and reads the note.
C: CAROL
D: "Looking for someone to take turns at the wheel and share expenses... on a week long cross country blue- highways tour of historic murder sites..." You gotta be kidding. Who in their right mind would want to do that?
E: beat
C: BRIAN
D: ...I would.
N: Brian smiles at her and walks away.
C: CAROL
D: Like I said...
E: watching Brian walk away
N: She shakes her head.
C: EARLY
D: Where's the personnel office at?
N: Carol turns to see Early.
C: RITA
D: First door on the left.
E: points down the hall
N: She walks away. Early's eye catches the bulletin board, he sees in bold red marker - "CALIFORNIA."
S: EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - LATE THAT NIGHT
N: Adele steps out of the trailer.
C: ADELE
D: Early?
N: She walks carefully around the junk piles. It's dark; hard to see. She comes to the edge of a deep dark hole and peers in... She can't see anything but hears the rustling of a shovel digging.
C: ADELE
D: Early? You down there?
N: The sound of digging stops.
C: EARLY
D: What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
E: from inside the hole
C: ADELE
D: Almost.
N: After a moment's hesitation, Early resumes his digging.
C: ADELE
D: Early...
N: The digging stops again.
C: ADELE
D: Tell me more about California.
N: The moonlight illuminates his face when he looks up at her.
C: EARLY
D: Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
C: ADELE
D: I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
C: EARLY
D: Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn... ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
E: beat
C: ADELE
D: What'll we do out there?
C: EARLY
D: Well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of Lucky Lager and climb up on toppa' that famous Hollywood sign and howl at the moon...
N: Early lets out a playful howl, as Adele looks up over her shoulder at the moon.
C: ADELE
D: You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
C: EARLY
D: Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.
N: Adele smiles and begins walking back to the trailer.
C: ADELE
D: Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
C: EARLY
D: I heard that.
N: After a moment, Early climbs out of the hole and stands in the moonlight for a moment. We see that he's completely naked except for a pair of high top steel toed work boots. Early gazes up into the night sky, looking at the cold white moon.
S: EXT. BRIAN AND CARRIE'S LOFT - DAWN
N: Brian exits loft carrying two bags. Carrie is also carrying a bag, and smoking a cigarette, as they walk to the car.
C: CARRIE
D: What did he sound like on the phone?
C: BRIAN
D: Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
N: Brian throws the bags in the open trunk with the other bags.
C: BRIAN
D: I like that.
E: grins
C: CARRIE
D: I still think we should have met them first.
C: BRIAN
D: Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?
N: Carrie bows her head and folds her hands in mock prayer.
C: CARRIE
D: Please God, we're gonna be stuck with these people for a week, don't let them be as boring as Brian's friends. Anything... but that.
N: Brian throws a needling glance to Carrie and slams the car hood shut. They both get into the car, Brian behind the wheel.
S: INT. LINCOLN
C: BRIAN
D: Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance." "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"
E: quotes from the movie
C: CARRIE
D: Funny, very funny.
N: Brian starts the car. It backfires loudly startling Carrie. Brian laughs.
C: BRIAN
D: "Aintry? This river don't go to Aintry."
E: quoting again
S: EXT. LINCOLN ON STREET
N: The engine revs again and the Lincoln pulls away down the street.
S: EXT. BUS STATION - DAWN
N: PAN UP from Adele's new red high-heeled shoes. We hear Adele speaking with an unfamiliar tone of authority to her voice.
C: ADELE
D: We shouldn't be doin' this, Early. You leavin' the state, ridin' around with strangers... besides, what kinda people would want to stop at places where other people was murdered.
N: The camera slowly reveals Adele... and the fact that she is alone as she voices her concerns. Then from behind her Early approaches. Just in time to hear...
C: ADELE
D: What if they're dangerous?
C: EARLY
D: They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
N: Startled, Adele drops her shoulder bag. It lands on top of a couple of cardboard boxes and a beat up old duffle bag -- all their possessions. A few personal items spill out of it.
C: ADELE
D: Early Grayce!
N: She kneels down to pick things up.
C: ADELE
D: Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
E: changes subject
C: EARLY
D: Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
N: EARLY'S POV As Adele picks up her spilled personal possessions, Early notices her prized cactus in the bag.
C: EARLY
D: What's this?
N: He angrily reaches in and grabs it.
C: ADELE
D: Early!
N: She reaches for the cactus but misses.
C: EARLY
D: What kind of a person would carry a cactus in her purse!
N: Adele bites her lip almost crying. Suddenly, Early looks past Adele to see something, Adele turns too. NEW ANGLE The Lincoln comes gliding into view.
S: INT. LINCOLN - PULLS INTO BUS STATION - DAWN
N: Through the windshield we see Early... Adele by his side.
C: CARRIE
D: You've got to be kidding me, they look like Okies!
N: Brian honks the horn, Early waves back.
C: CARRIE
D: Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
C: BRIAN
D: Lighten up...
N: ON EARLY AND ADELE
C: ADELE
D: Geez, they look kinda weird.
C: EARLY
D: You just smile, let me do all the talking.
C: ADELE
D: How many times you gonna tell me that?
C: EARLY
D: As many times as it takes.
E: smiling at Brian
S: EXT. BUS STATION
N: Brian stops the Lincoln and gets out. He approaches Early and shakes his hand, then Adele's.
C: BRIAN
D: Hi I'm Brian... Early, and you must be Adele.
N: An awkward moment as everyone just stands there... until Brian reaches for Adele's bag.
C: BRIAN
D: Let me help you.
N: Brian picks up her bag and carries it to the Lincoln. Adele is instantly won over by the gesture -- Early leery of it.
S: INT. LINCOLN
N: Carrie watches as Brian and Early carry their things to the trunk. Carrie leans forward and sets the trip odometer to zero. When she sits back up, Adele is standing at her window.
C: ADELE
D: Hi, I'm Adele.
C: CARRIE
D: Carrie.
E: reserved
N: She turns away from the window...
C: ADELE
D: I like your hair.
E: shyly
N: Carrie turns back, rolls down window...
C: CARRIE
D: ...Pardon?
C: ADELE
D: ...I said, I like your hair.
C: CARRIE
D: ...Thank you.
N: She turns and sees Early reflected in the side mirror watching her. He grins at her, Carrie looks away. NEW ANGLE: FROM INSIDE THE TRUNK OF THE LINCOLN Brian crams the last of the bags in, as Early watches.
C: BRIAN
D: Tight fit.
C: EARLY
D: Best kind.
N: Brian looks to him, Early grins and winks. Brian slams the Lincoln trunk lid shut. SCREEN TO BLACK
S: EXT. EARLY'S BURNING TRAILER - DAWN
N: From the blackness... The camera rises from a pile of rubble. As it ascends we reveal Diebold's pitbulls howling and digging at a mound of fresh earth where Early's hole used to be. The crackling flames of a nearby fire illuminate the scene. Deep in the distance, the wail of approaching sirens. ANOTHER ANGLE Reveal that it's Early's trailer and car that are on fire.
S: INT. TRAILER
N: Flames consume the magazine photos of Elvis and Priscilla, Farrah and Ryan, Early and Adele. Along with them, the black and white photo of young Early and his mother.

S: EXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING
N: The Lincoln passes through on its way out of town.
S: INT. MOVING LINCOLN - MORNING
N: Brian behind the wheel, Carrie riding shotgun. Early and Adele are sitting in the back seat. An awkward silence prevails. Brian clears his throat.
C: BRIAN
D: Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
C: EARLY
D: Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
C: BRIAN
D: Brian.
C: EARLY
D: Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
N: Brian raises his eyebrow a tad, but is not really curious about it.
C: ADELE
D: It's because of what he read in a book once... That folks needin' breakfast is a myth, or whatever, put out by those cereal people.
N: A glance passes between Brian and Carrie. Is she for real? CARRIE'S POV - IN VANITY MIRROR Early motions Adele not to talk so much. NEW ANGLE
C: BRIAN
D: So what do you do Early?
C: EARLY
D: Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to...
C: ADELE
D: One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke... Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
E: beat
C: CARRIE
D: Karma.
N: Adele and early show no sign of understanding the word.

N: Everyone takes a last look at the familiar countryside. Carrie is snapping photos of the twisting concrete overpasses and the gloomy grey sky beyond.
S: INT. LINCOLN
N: Adele watches Carrie, intrigued by the obvious skill Carrie shows with the camera. Brian glances into the rear-view mirror at Adele.
C: BRIAN
D: So Adele, did Early happen to mention the places we'll be stopping at?
N: ON ADELE'S REFLECTION IN MIRROR... then Early leans in front of her.
C: EARLY
D: Yeah Bri' I did.
N: Adele leans against Carrie's front seat.
C: ADELE
D: Are you takin' the pictures?
E: to Carrie
C: CARRIE
D: ...Yeah.
E: surprised
C: ADELE
D: Is it hard to learn?
C: CARRIE
D: Not really.
N: Early pulls Adele back toward the back seat.
C: EARLY
D: You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
E: to Brian
C: BRIAN
D: That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
C: EARLY
D: ...Too bad.
S: EXT. LINCOLN
N: Lincoln drives off down the highway.
S: EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - LATER
N: Police and Firemen sift through the smoking ruins of Early's trailer. The Parole Officer pulls up in his car, he gets out and approaches a Police Officer.
C: PAROLE OFFICER
D: What happened?
C: POLICE OFFICER
D: Who are you?
C: PAROLE OFFICER
D: His Parole Officer.
C: POLICE OFFICER
D: Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
C: PAROLE OFFICER
D: Could be.
C: POLICE OFFICER
D: Where would we find him?
C: PAROLE OFFICER
D: Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
C: POLICE OFFICER
D: Without his car?
N: We see the smoldering remains of Early's Grand Prix. In the background Diebold's pitbulls are being dragged away by a Dog Wrangler.
C: POLICE OFFICER
D: What about the owner of the house... ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
E: reads from note pad
C: PAROLE OFFICER
D: No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
N: From inside Early's hole we hear a voice call out.
C: LABORER
D: Jesus Christ!
E: O.S.
N: Parole Officer and Police Officer turn back toward the trailer, as people rush to the site. NEW ANGLE - OVERHEAD The camera aerials down past those gathering around the freshly dug hole to... a Laborer standing at the bottom of the pit. Alongside his shovel, we see that a man's arm has been unearthed. LOW ANGLE UP TO THE TOP OF THE HOLE The Police and Parole Officer join several others standing there.
C: PAROLE OFFICER
D: ...Diebold?
C: POLICE OFFICER
D: ...That'd be my guess.
C: PAROLE OFFICER
D: Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
C: POLICE OFFICER
D: Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
N: The two men look to one another... as others begin to unearth the body.
S: EXT. MOVING LINCOLN DRIVING DOWN COUNTRY ROAD
N: Close up, Diebold's ring on a hand twisting open a bottle cap. Pull back to reveal that it is Early as he opens a bottle of Lucky Lager beer and takes a sip. On the back seat between them sits a brown paper bag. Adele reaches into the bag and pulls out a cheap pocket camera. Excitedly she rips open the box and pulls out the camera. She leans over and kisses Early.
C: ADELE
D: Thank you.
N: Early reaches in the bag and pulls out a small plastic bottle of mineral water and an orange juice.
C: EARLY
D: All right, who gets the... ...water.
E: can't pronounce name
N: Carrie turns around, Early hands her the water. Early leans forward and hands Brian the orange juice.
C: EARLY
D: Here you go Bri'. Got a couple a bags of chips and some jerky, just holler if you want some.
N: Then Early reaches past Brian to the rear-view mirror and hangs a plastic St. Christopher statue around it.
C: EARLY
D: Can't hurt.
C: BRIAN
D: How much do I owe you?
C: EARLY
D: Forget it.
N: Adele struggles to understand the camera instructions on the side of the box. She leans forward and shows Carrie her camera.
C: ADELE
D: Guess I don't know the first thing about cameras.
E: embarrassed
N: Carrie deliberates her response for a moment, then...
C: CARRIE
D: Well, the first thing... is you need film. Preferably black and white.
N: Carrie pulls a roll of film out of her bag and takes Adele's camera to load.
C: ADELE
D: You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
C: CARRIE
D: ...Yeah, sure.
N: She pulls a roll of color film out of her camera bag and quickly snaps it into the camera.
C: ADELE
D: I like things in color, pink, purple, and red. I dunno, black and white is kinda... boring.
N: Carrie points the camera at a smiling Adele and snaps the first picture.
C: CARRIE
D: You just aim and press the button.
N: Adele takes the camera.
S: INT. LINCOLN

C: ADELE
D: I've heard of that! It's where Dolly Parton has her park. "Dollywood". I just think that's so clever. Hollywood. Dollywood. Get it?
N: With that, she plops back down into the back seat.
S: INT. LINCOLN
C: EARLY
D: Shush, Adele.
E: under his breath
C: ADELE
D: Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY
N: As we see the car disappearing into the distance, we can still hear Adele rambling on.

E: O.S.
T: FADE OUT:
S: EXT. LARGE ISOLATED OLD FARM - AFTERNOON
N: The Lincoln approaches on a dirtroad and passes a mailbox with the name "BAXTER" on it. The Lincoln turns into the long driveway.
S: INT. LINCOLN - SAME TIME
N: Brian begins talking into a small portable tape recorder.
C: BRIAN
D: The Novaks are all gone but the fence that Michael Zaruba was hired to put up is still here.
N: He glances to Carrie, who fires off several photos of the fence and yard. The Lincoln continues slowly down the long drive... Up ahead through the windshield Brian sees a beautiful old farm house.
C: BRIAN
D: The Novaks embraced the young drifter as one of their own.
S: EXT. LINCOLN
N: The Lincoln slows to a halt. Carrie and Brian exit the car and begin walking toward the house. Early follows. Adele, uncertain about what's transpiring, trails behind.
C: ADELE
D: Hey you two.
N: Brian and Carrie turn to see... Adele training a camera on them.
C: ADELE
D: Give me a smile now.
N: Brian and Carrie look to one another then force a weak smile. Early jumps in and throws a pair of devil's horns up behind Brian's unsuspecting head as... the shutter clicks. Brian and Carrie quickly turn their attention back on the house.
C: BRIAN
D: Neighbors said he was a quiet young man, who was often seen pushing the children on the swing set.
E: continues into tape recorder
N: An unusual bird house and a tricycle sit in the front yard. To the side of the house are the remains of an old swing set. Carrie finds an interesting angle on the swing set, with the house in the background, SNAP! She fires off a shot.
C: BRIAN
D: Everything was fine until the day the family ran out of work for Michael, and had to ask him to leave.
E: continuing
N: As Carrie frames up another shot, Early crosses in front of her camera. Realizing he is in Carrie's photo he stops and poses. Carrie looks to Brian.
C: BRIAN
D: Sorry, Early... Could you step out the way, for a second?
N: Early is surprised that they don't want him in the photograph. He wanders away from the front of the house. Meanwhile, Adele photographs the moment.
C: BRIAN
D: The first one to die was the nine year old daughter...
N: Just then... A NINE YEAR OLD GIRL comes running from around the side of the house. She stops dead when she sees all of them. Carrie snaps a final photo.
C: BRIAN
D: Hello.
N: The little girl scans all their faces.
C: BRIAN
D: ...My name's Brian, what's yours?
N: The little girl remains silent. Brian rolls a look to Carrie then back to the little girl.
C: BRIAN
D: ...Could I speak to your parents?
N: After an awkward pause, the little girl silently crosses the yard to the porch and opens the front door.
C: GIRL
D: Pa! There's more of them.
E: rudely
S: EXT. REAR OF HOUSE - SAME TIME
N: Looking into the house through a kitchen window we can see into the entrance hall and through to the open front door. Brian waits outside on the porch, as the little girl enters the house looking for her father. Inside the kitchen, right next to the window, is a side table with a telephone and a purse on it. Suddenly... Early's reflection appears in the window; he has obviously seen the purse. AT THE FRONT DOOR Brian motions for Carrie to join him. AT THE SWING SET Adele watches Brian and Carrie for a moment, then loses interest. She stands on the seat of the swing and begins swinging. AT THE REAR OF THE HOUSE Early tries to push up the kitchen window. It barely lifts three inches before jamming. Through the room we see the little girl and her father step to the front door.
S: EXT. FRONT DOOR
N: A MIDDLE AGED FARMER with tanned leathery skin. He is not happy. Brian extends his hand...
C: BRIAN
D: Hi, my name is Brian Kessler.
E: friendly
N: The father says nothing and does not respond to the extended hand. Brian retracts his hand.
C: BRIAN
D: I'm a writer, I'm working on a book about famous murderers.
E: continues -- less confident
N: AT THE SWING SET Adele swings higher. Her summer dress ripples in the wind. A smile on her face.
S: EXT. KITCHEN WINDOW
N: Early's entire arm is through the opening. His shoulder presses against the window pane. But still he can't reach the purse. So, he grabs the tablecloth and begins pulling it toward him. The purse slides closer, inch by inch. All the while, he keeps one eye on the Farmer across the room. EARLY'S POV (ACROSS THE ROOM) The Farmer's back is turned to the kitchen as he listens silently to Brian.
C: BRIAN
D: ...I'm sure you're aware that this is the Novak house...
N: AT THE SWING SET Adele swings even higher. She's lost in the moment. Euphoric.
S: EXT. FRONT DOOR
C: BRIAN
D: ...I mean, this was the Novak house... With your permission I'd like to come in and photograph...
E: corrects himself pause
N: Before Brian can finish, the man slams the door in his face.
S: INT. KITCHEN (ANGLE ON FARMER)
N: The Farmer turns away from the front door.
C: FARMER
D: Goddamned ghouls...
E: muttering
N: IN THE KITCHEN We see that Early and the purse have gone.
S: EXT. FRONT DOOR
N: Brian is surprised. He just stands there a moment. He's not sure whether to knock again.
S: EXT. SWING SET
N: The empty swing sways back and forth.
S: EXT. LINCOLN
N: Brian and Carrie walk back to the car.
C: BRIAN
D: We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
E: upset
C: CARRIE
D: Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
N: Brian continues on in a huff until Carrie breaks stride and stops. She pulls him next to her.
C: CARRIE
D: It's okay... okay?
N: Brian glances back at the house. She interrupts his glance, kisses him.
C: BRIAN
D: ...That house is part of American history now, whether he likes it or not.
E: continuing on the heel of the kiss
N: They enter the car.
C: EARLY
D: Forget about it Bri'. I wouldn't be surprised if that Karma thing don't come back and get him.
N: Carrie, surprised at Early's new found philosophical belief. She looks into her side view mirror... And sees Early smiling back at her. Carrie looks away... CARRIE'S POV Shifts from the mirror to the house in the background... as the car pulls out of the driveway, the little girl watches from her porch. Sequence omitted from original script.
S: EXT. - LINCOLN PULLS UP TO MOTEL AND PARKS. INT. MOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: A small roadside diner. A fair number of people inside having dinner. Adele, Early, Carrie, and Brian are seated at one of the tables. AT THEIR TABLE Carrie watches Early eat with a kind of horrible, rude fascination. He has no table manners at all. He eats with his elbows on the table, fork wedged in the fist of his right hand. All the while, he chews with his mouth open. He's serious about his "eating."
C: BRIAN
D: Well we've come three hundred miles so far. Not a bad day's haul.
E: studying his map
N: Early doesn't bother to respond. He keeps eating.
C: BRIAN
D: You got any family or friends in California, Early?
N: CU ANGLE ON EARLY With a piece of bread he mops up the gravy on his plate.
C: EARLY
D: Nope... You?
E: chewing
N: ANGLE UNDER THE TABLE Early's foot itches... He tries to scratch it but it doesn't do any good.
C: BRIAN
D: No.
E: O.S.
C: ADELE
D: Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
E: O.S.
C: CARRIE
D: No.
E: O.S.
N: ANGLE - THE GROUP As Brian folds up the map. Early takes off his boot, then his well-worn sock. Carrie's look of disgust grows as Early brings his foot up onto his lap and scratches it while he eats. Carrie puts her fork down: dinner is over for her.
C: ADELE
D: ...Well, least we got each other. That's somethin'.
N: Brian looks up, sees Carrie's expression... Then what's causing it... Early mops up the last bit of food on his plate. He notices Brian and Carrie staring at him and slowly puts his foot back down on the floor -- then the sock. Brian picks up the check to see the total... Starts pulling his wallet out... Isn't quite sure how to bring up the tab to Early.
C: EARLY

N: The tap is running at the sink as Early empties the stolen purse. He adds the last few coins to a small pile of cash.

C: BRIAN
D: Look Carrie, we're gonna be stuck with these people for a week...

D: You finished?
N: Carrie pushes her body up against his in response.

D: ...Um, maybe... maybe not.

C: CARRIE

C: CARRIE
D: ...you believe that tattoo? Looks like he had another girls name there and carved it out.
N: Brian bites at her neck. She stops talking. His sweating shoulder presses against her face. She turns her head to encourage him. In the dresser mirror... she sees their shadowy reflections. Their bodies atangle under the sheets.
C: CARRIE
D: ...and that body odor.
N: Their reflection in the mirror intrigues her. Intoxicates her. His aggression excites her. She pulls him into her. The metal bedframe bangs against the motel wall repeatedly as they make love. Then slowly, the camera bisects the plaster and lumber divider and emerges in the next room... TO FIND Early leaning quietly against the same wall. Listening to them. As he does, he uses the scissors to cut through the crusty bandage on his finger. Then, across the room he notices Adele in bed asleep... the scissors stop. Sequence omitted from original script.

N: The Waitress gives him a curious look and walks away. Just then, Brian look past Early... A surprised expression crosses Brian's face. Early turns to see... Adele approaching the table. Her hair has been crudely chopped to resemble Carrie's. It looks like shit.
C: CARRIE
D: You cut your hair.
E: at a loss for words
N: Adele smiles, pleased with Carrie for noticing. She sits down next to Brian.
C: ADELE

C: EARLY

N: Carrie scans the landscape with her camera. She sees Adele walking around a small roadside graveyard. She is reading the epitaphs on the headstones. Carrie fires off a few shots. Then she sees Early, she can't help but notice Early's lean body. She zooms in on his muscles and prison tattoo. Click!! Early completes the task. Together he and Brian begin putting everything back in the trunk. Suddenly, from behind, Adele jumps onto Early's back, surprising him. He gives her a "horsey ride" around the Lincoln. ON CARRIE She notices Early's wallet on the ground. ON EARLY AND ADELE She's riding him, covering his eyes playfully. ON CARRIE She picks up the wallet. BENEATH THE LINCOLN Early's feet galloping.

Aggravated, the driver leans on the horn and motions Early out of his way. Early stares at the man a moment longer, then steps to one side and lets the car pull past him.

C: EARLY
D: You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?

D: My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
C: CARRIE
D: What's Early been in jail for?
E: interrupting
C: ADELE
D: Carryin' a gun.
E: reluctantly
C: CARRIE
D: ...Anything else?
C: ADELE
D: An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
C: CARRIE
D: Jeez... Adele!
N: Adele realizes she has said too much, looks at her watch.
C: ADELE
D: I'd better be goin'. It's late.
N: Adele hastily weaves her way out the door.
C: CARRIE
D: Great.
N: Carrie stares down at her feet. Red toenails. Cottonballs between the toes. Sequence omitted from original script.
S: EXT. THE BOWLING ALLEY BAR
N: Early and Brian exit the bar. They make their way to the Lincoln. On the way...
C: EARLY
D: Got to see a man about a mule.
N: Brian looks at Early, doesn't understand.
C: EARLY
D: Gotta take a piss.
N: Early branches off behind the car.
C: EARLY
D: Any reebs left in the back seat?
N: Early starts to take a leak.
C: EARLY
D: Aaahhhhh... That's what we used to call a beer when we was kids... Beer spelled backwards.
E: relief
N: Brian reaches in the back seat and grabs the last Lucky Lager. He crosses to the other side of the car and hands Early the beer.
C: BRIAN
D: Last one.
N: Early stares at the last of the Lucky Lagers.
C: EARLY
D: ...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
C: BRIAN
D: No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
N: Early takes the beer.
C: EARLY
D: Hey, that's what buddies are for, right...?
N: Early polishes off the rest of the bottle and heaves it into the woods.
C: EARLY
D: You know those doors I was talking about? Found two of them back in Kentucky. Shit, I wasn't even looking for one the first time. Me and the boys are just swingin' our sickles by the side of the road, and I turned around and there it was... this door with this bright blinding white light all around it... course I'm thinkin' I must be sunstroked or somethin'... so I close my eyes figurin' I'll count ten and it'll be gone right... so I'm countin'... ...1-2-3-4-5... an' I'm 'bout ta piss myself right... -6-7-8-9... 10. An' I open my eyes slow, spectin' it won't be there right...
E: voice drops almost to a whisper he closes his eyes
N: When Early opens his eyes, he sees a concerned look on Brian's face.
C: EARLY
D: ...and it wasn't.
E: unconvincingly
N: An awkward silence. Then Early starts laughing. Brian follows suit. They both climb back in the car. Their forced laughter trails off. Brian shifts the Lincoln back into gear and segues awkwardly...
C: BRIAN
D: What were you "swinging a sickle" for?
N: Early stares at Brian. For a moment Brian is unsure what Early will say, or do? Then Early grins...
C: EARLY
D: For... 'bout three years.
N: Brian brakes their eye contact, looks back out onto the highway and just drives off. Sequence omitted from original script.
S: INT. BRIAN AND CARRIE'S MOTEL ROOM - LATER
N: The door opens revealing Brian silhouetted in the doorway. Under the influence of Lucky Lager, he fumbles with the key... gets inside and noisily shuts the door behind him. Carrie remains stonily silent, in the dark.
C: BRIAN
D: Gotta see a man about a mule... What's wrong?
N: A few seconds pass.
C: CARRIE
D: The same thing that's been "wrong" the whole trip. Your good buddy Early.
N: Carrie, in bed, switches on the side table light. Reveals Brian leaning on the wall trying to get his shoes off without falling over.
C: BRIAN
D: Who said he's my good buddy?
C: CARRIE
D: You sure been acting like you were... ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
E: redneck accent
N: Brian points to the empty beer bottles on the table.
C: BRIAN
D: Hey come on, you two were drinking too... so what's the big deal.
N: Brian throws his shoes somewhere and heads toward the bathroom.
C: CARRIE
D: Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her.
C: BRIAN
D: How do you know that?
C: CARRIE
D: She told me... ...but only when she "deserves" it. Did you know he was in jail?
E: adding
N: BATHROOM Brian turns on the light. Takes a piss. A long one.
C: BRIAN
D: Yeah, for stealing a car. Aaahhhh.
N: Suddenly, from right behind him:
C: CARRIE
D: Bullshit!
E: O.S.
N: Startled, Brian turns to see Carrie.
C: CARRIE
D: ...He told her it was for carrying a gun, but the truth could be murder for all we know.
N: No response from Brian. Carrie walks away. LIVING ROOM Carrie steps over to the bed, pulls the sheets back. Brian leans out the bathroom door:
C: BRIAN
D: Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
C: CARRIE
D: Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
N: Brian smacks himself on the forehead (a sarcastic "how stupid of me!") He pulls his shirt off over his head, and admits...
C: BRIAN
D: Of course! The accent, the clothes, and those table manners!... He's got to be a mass murderer! What else could he be?
E: sarcastically pause
N: He switches off the bathroom light, steps out of the doorway, and begins to pull his jeans off. Carrie climbs into bed.
C: BRIAN
D: You know, it wouldn't even surprise me if he turned out to be... a Republican!
N: Brian tosses his jeans and moves toward the bed. Carrie switches off the the only light in the room. In the dark, we hear a thud as Brian trips over a chair.
C: BRIAN
D: Goddamnit!... my fucking toe!
S: EXT. BRIAN AND CARRIE'S MOTEL ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
N: Carrie leaves the motel room, ice bucket in hand.
C: CARRIE
D: Try not to lose consciousness 'til I get back.
E: to Brian inside room
S: EXT. MOTEL CORRIDOR
N: At the far end of a narrow hallway, Carrie finds an ice machine rumbling away noisily. The only illumination, a single fluorescent light bulb, hangs suspended above it. AT THE ICE MACHINE With her arm buried inside the ice machine, Carrie scavenges for what little ice there is... when, out of the corner of her eye, she notices... SOMEONE standing at the other end of the corridor. The silhouette of a man. Carrie stops. Her eyes scan the claustrophobic hallway for another way out. There is none. She tries to ignore the situation. Grabs another handful of ice cubes. The man approaches. Carrie stops again. Her mind races. The man's face slowly becomes visible as he nears the fluorescent light. It's Early.
C: EARLY
D: Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
C: CARRIE
D: ...Brian hurt his foot.
N: Early reaches past her into the ice machine and grabs a solitary cube. He puts it in his mouth, sucks on it. His torso is drenched in sweat. He catches Carrie staring at him.
C: EARLY
D: Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
C: CARRIE
D: No.
E: tenuous
N: Early spits the ice cube back into his hand. He presses it against the back of his neck.
C: EARLY
D: I can feel it start to run down my neck... ...and down my back... right into my pants.
E: he turns his back to show her
N: Carrie follows a bead of ice water as it slides down between his shoulder blades and along his back.
C: EARLY
D: ...and everything starts stickin' together... keeps running down the back of my legs like two rivers racin' for my boots, see who gets there first.
N: He snaps a look back to Carrie and finds her looking at his ass. She diverts her glance.
C: EARLY
D: You never get that hot, huh?
N: Carrie shakes her head no. Early looks in his hand to see that his ice cube has melted.
C: CARRIE
D: I gotta get back before this ice melts.
N: Carrie tries to slip past him. He reaches back into the machine, momentarily blocking her exit. He grabs another ice cube. His face only inches from hers.
C: EARLY
D: ...never?
C: CARRIE
D: No, never. Excuse me.
N: He pops the ice cube in his mouth and lets her pass.
C: EARLY
D: You like Skynard?
N: No response, Early chews up the ice cube. Sequence omitted from original script.
S: EXT. LINCOLN LEAVING THE MOTEL - NEXT MORNING
N: The car crawls out of the parking lot.
S: INT. LINCOLN
N: Carrie is driving. Brian is contending with a major hangover. There is still a silent tension between Brian and Carrie from the argument the night before. Early is in the back with Adele. Brian moves his head and moans.
C: ADELE
D: My daddy always took sauerkraut juice and tobasco sauce for a hangover, mixed in one egg not two, and some tomato juice...
N: From the front seat, Brian's hand springs up in a desperate plea for an end to Adele's colorful description.
C: BRIAN
D: I'm okay, thanks.
N: Brian rolls down his window for some fresh air, as the car pulls away.
S: EXT. LINCOLN ON HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER
N: THE CAR IS HEADING DOWN A COUNTRY ROAD.
S: INT. LINCOLN
N: Carrie glances over at Brian, who is now asleep next to her. She looks up into her rear-view mirror... CARRIE'S POV: IN THE MIRROR Early is asleep, leaning against the door. Adele is rummaging through a large canvas bag on the seat next to her. Suddenly... The wail of an approaching ambulance gets Carrie's attention. It roars by. Carrie glances in the mirror again. The next instant, unexpectedly...
S: EXT. LINCOLN
N: She furiously pulls the car off the road to an abrupt halt.
S: INT. LINCOLN
N: Brian's heads bangs against the side window.
C: BRIAN
D: What! What!
N: Carrie nods toward the back seat. Brian turns and sees Adele looking back at them questioningly. Beside her, Early rustles.
C: BRIAN
D: What is it?
C: CARRIE
D: Look again!
N: Brian notices that Adele's rummaging has revealed an automatic pistol in the open canvas bag. Brian stares at it. Early's eyes open.
S: EXT. PARKED LINCOLN - LATER
N: A deserted plain. It's very quiet here. Until the silence is broken by the sound of gunshots. Reveal Early teaching Brian how to shoot. A row of tin cans are set up on a rusty old car. It's obvious that Brian's enthralled with the idea of shooting the gun. Even if he isn't hitting anything.
C: EARLY
D: Only thing my old man ever gave me is that goddamn .45.
N: Brian fires off another shot, misses again.
C: EARLY
D: Bri', you're jerkin' it when you pull the trigger, hold it real steady.
N: Nearby stands an unhappy Carrie. Adele pulls her yoyo out of her pocket.
C: ADELE
D: Boys'll be boys.
N: Carrie doesn't respond. Adele offers the yoyo to Carrie.
C: ADELE
D: You know any tricks?
N: Carrie shakes her head no. Adele withdraws her offer.
C: ADELE
D: You wanna learn some?
N: Again Carrie declines. Her steely gaze returns to Brian. ON EARLY AND BRIAN Early helps Brian to hold the gun.
C: EARLY
D: Steady... Breath in... now let half of it out, and... fire.
N: BANG!! The can flies off the tree stump. Brian turns to Carrie to see her reaction... but she's already on her way back to the car, and she's furious. Concerned, Brian starts to follow after her... But Early grabs his attention.
C: EARLY
D: Bri, I want you to keep this gun... consider it a present. Never know, California could turn out to be a dangerous place.
N: Brian gazes at the gun resting in the palm of his hand.
S: EXT. AN EMPTY HIGHWAY - DAY
N: The Lincoln rolling along.
S: INT. LINCOLN
N: Brian is driving. Carrie keeps to herself. In her side mirror she catches a glimpse of Early curled up in Adele's lap. She watches a moment longer... and realizes that they are making out. Beginning to kiss and touch one another.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY NEAR ABATTOIR - LATE AFTERNOON
N: The Lincoln turns off the main highway onto a dirt road. In the distance, we see a large rundown building.
S: INT. AN OLD DESERTED ABATTOIR - AFTERNOON
N: The Lincoln pulls up to the ramshackle structure. Brian glances to the back seat to make a remark to Early and Adele and sees that they are amorously engaged. Brian and Carrie start to gather their stuff. Carrie opens the glove compartment, inside are boxes of film... and the .45 automatic. She takes a few packs of film, and closes the glove compartment.
C: EARLY
D: Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
C: CARRIE
D: Siesta.
E: pissed off
N: Carrie reaches over and takes the keys from the ignition, locks the glove compartment and pockets the key. Both she and Brian exit the car. As they start to walk toward the structure Brian hears a sound, he turns back to see. Adele leaning forward into the frontseat as the lincoln's big white top starts to come up.
S: INT. ABATTOIR
N: Even in daylight, the interior of the dilapidated old building is equal parts unnerving, austere, and menacing. The last rays of sunlight stream through what remains of the windows. The light falls on a long ominous row of wicked looking meat- hooks hanging from the ceiling. Carrie is getting her camera equipment ready. She's quiet and uncommunicative. NEW ANGLE CLOSE, on a small audio cassette player as it comes to rest on a giant butcher block table in the center of the room. Brian pops a cassette in the player.
C: CARRIE
D: What's that?
C: BRIAN
D: A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
N: Camera in hand, Carrie begins to move about, despite the fact that this place repels her. Brian presses a button on the audio cassette player. The small tinny speaker plays a bad recording of something we slowly come to realize is the unmistakable sounds of a woman being tortured and pleading for her life. FLASH!! FLASH!! Carrie fires off a series of shots from different angles. Brian scans the place trying to imagine what happened. Screams from the audio tape bounce off the walls.
C: BRIAN
D: His mother had him working in here before he was eight years old... killing animals with a sledgehammer that was bigger than he was.
E: speaks into his small hand held tape recorder
N: Brian and Carrie walk through the remains of a doorway into another room.
C: BRIAN
D: When she was pissed at him, she'd beat the shit out of him and lock him in here overnight...
N: The pleas for help and screams on the tape subside to a steady whimpering.
C: BRIAN
D: ...Eventually the boy wakes up one morning, picks up that sledgehammer and starts hurting back.
E: continuing
N: FLASH!! FLASH!! Carrie takes a few more shots of the ominous interior. Then she stops, turns and walks out of the room. She's had enough. Brian follows after her.
C: BRIAN
D: There's more...
C: CARRIE
D: I'm finished.
N: Carrie stops to pick up the rest of her gear.
C: BRIAN
D: Look... I know you're pissed off about the gun, and I don't blame you...
N: Carrie wheels around to face him.
C: CARRIE
D: Brian, I'm not pissed off. God damm it, turn that thing off.
N: She switches off the cassette player.
C: CARRIE
D: I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
C: BRIAN
D: Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright? But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
E: pause
C: CARRIE
D: I can't believe I agreed to do this.
C: BRIAN
D: Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
C: CARRIE
D: Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
N: Carrie storms out of the place. She exits the tunnel, and makes her way toward... THE LINCOLN As she approaches it, through the rear windshield she sees... Early and Adele fucking wildly! Carrie wants to turn away, but she can't stop watching them. Fascinated, she raises the camera to her eye and zooms in on them. THROUGH CARRIE'S CAMERA LENS: ON EARLY AND ADELE Early is sitting against the back seat. Adele is straddling him. Carrie's finger finds the shutter button. Early's arms move up under Adele's dress... Her hands press up against the roof. She's trembling... Wavering... Carrie's finger presses down on the button, CLICK!! Then in one swift movement Early sweeps Adele onto the back seat. Close on Early's face. He's sweating... Lips moving... Talking dirty to Adele. Keeping her finger on the button, Carrie rapid fires through a whole roll of film. She's oblivious to the whine of the motor drive once all the film is shot out. Then unexpectedly!! Early looks directly into the camera, at Carrie. And smiles... And continues to fuck Adele. A chill rushes through Carrie, she almost drops the camera. She runs back toward the tunnel... and right into Brian's arms. He startles her. She pulls away from him.
C: CARRIE
D: Brian I want him out of our car!
C: BRIAN
D: Why, what did he do?
C: CARRIE
D: Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do!
S: EXT. DESERT - DUSK
N: The Lincoln passes through frame. In the background, the surreal image of an industrial complex bathed in an eerie artificial light.
S: INT. LINCOLN PULLS INTO A GAS STATION - TWILIGHT
N: An electrical storm is in full swing.
S: EXT. GAS STATION
N: The Lincoln barely comes to a stop at the pumps before Carrie storms out of the car and heads toward the gas station interior. She leaves Brian to break the news to Adele and Early.
S: INT. GAS STATION
N: The only person inside is a YOUNG MALE ATTENDANT. He's watching TV behind the counter as Carrie enters. On the TV we see a NEWSMAN. We only catch fragments of what he is saying because the storm outside is affecting the TV reception.
C: CARRIE
D: Twenty dollars in the tank and a carton of cigarettes.
N: In fact, each time the lightning flashes occur all of the electrical power at the station is affected. The fluorescent lights outside and inside begin to flicker and falter sporadically.
C: NEWSMAN
D: ...the ex-mental patient with a history of arrests is still at large...
N: Static. Carrie looks at the TV, watches for a moment. It doesn't hold her attention. She looks away and notices Adele leaving the car. Adele walks toward a Coke machine at the other end of the gas station.
C: ATTENDANT
D: Here's your cigarettes...
N: Carrie turns back toward him.
C: ATTENDANT
D: ...And change. Better be careful, looks like a bad one coming. Where you headin'?
C: CARRIE
D: California.
C: ATTENDANT
D: Hear it never rains there. Must be nice.
N: He buttons up his rain coat and goes out into the night to gas up the Lincoln. Carrie pulls a pack of cigarettes from the carton, nervously lights one up. She looks out the window toward the Lincoln.
S: EXT. GAS PUMPS
N: Through flashes of lightning and thunder she sees Brian in the car talking to Early. Early listening quietly. Brian looking adamant yet apologetic. The attendant fills the Lincoln's tank.
S: INT. GAS STATION
N: Simultaneously, as Carrie watches this... Behind her on the TV screen... A wave of interference scrambles the picture.
C: NEWSCASTER
D: ...we would like to repeat...
N: Static.
C: NEWSCASTER
D: ...there is a nationwide manhunt for...
N: Static.
S: INT. GAS STATION - ON THE TV
N: The static clears and the Newscaster appears.
C: NEWSCASTER
D: ...is believed responsible for the murders of his landlord John Diebold...
E: O.S.
N: Static.
S: EXT. GAS PUMPS - TIGHTER ON LINCOLN
N: Brian's still talking -- using his hands to explain. Early is watching him with a resigned expression.
S: INT. GAS STATION - ON THE TV
N: A video tape image of a familiar gas station recorded by a surveillance camera.
C: NEWSCASTER
D: ...of the fatal stabbing and robbery of Mr. Joseph Davies Robbins...
N: NEW ANGLE ON CARRIE She stares at the TV with growing horror as she notices a familiar black Lincoln in the background. In mid-ground, a male figure approaches the video camera unknowingly. Slowly, Early's image becomes visible.
C: NEWSCASTER
D: If you see this man...
N: Carrie panics, turns toward the door and runs smack into the arms of a dripping wet Early Grayce! Early stares at her and drops his bag to the ground.
C: EARLY
D: I ain't ridin' in no bus... bitch.
N: Then... Early notices himself on the TV.
C: NEWSCASTER
D: ...call your local police or FBI...
E: O.S.
N: Static. Early grabs Carrie around the neck and yanks her into the back office. He pushes her down onto a chair.
C: EARLY
D: You just sit there and keep your mouth shut.
N: He searches behind the cash register and finds a sawed-off shotgun. He shuts the TV off.
C: EARLY
D: I knew that boy'd have a hogleg here somewhere.
N: The Attendant rushes back in from the pouring rain. Early points the sawed-off shotgun at him.
C: EARLY
D: Get over here.
N: Early forces him into the office.
C: EARLY
D: Sit your ass down in that corner.
N: Adele enters the adjacent room. She checks out the various vending machines in search of candy. Early taps on the window and motions her into the office. She sees Carrie in the chair, scared to death, and Early aiming the gun at the Attendant.
C: ADELE
D: Early, what're you doin'?
C: EARLY
D: Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here... Do it Adele... Now!
E: beat
N: Adele looks back at Carrie, then hurries out. Early empties the cash register.
C: EARLY
D: What's your name, boy?
C: ATTENDANT
D: Walter Livesy.
E: very scared
C: EARLY
D: Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
C: ATTENDANT
D: Not so good. You sure you have to?
C: EARLY
D: I don't know. Wish I did.
C: CARRIE
D: Early, just think...
C: EARLY
D: Shut your mouth.
S: INT. LINCOLN
N: Adele opens the door on the driver's side looking scared. Brian is in the passenger seat. He's looking in the glove compartment for a map. The .45 automatic Early gave Brian is clearly visible. Adele stares at it.
C: BRIAN
D: Adele, what are you doing back here?
N: Adele gets in and starts looking under the seats.
C: ADELE
D: ...Lost my purse... Could you help me look for it? It's probably under the seat.
S: INT. GAS STATION
N: The Attendant is reaching up, handing Early the money from his pockets. Carrie is seated in front of him.
C: EARLY
D: Where you from Walter?
C: ATTENDANT
D: Vernon, Florida.
E: nervous shake
C: EARLY
D: Never heard of it, any huntin'?
C: ATTENDANT
D: Turkey mostly.
C: EARLY
D: Turkey's are real smart. Smarter than most people think...
N: Early rips the phone out of the wall.
C: EARLY
D: Tell you what Walter, you lie down there now... You make sure you stay put for a while after we leave... Okay?
N: The attendant nods yes.
C: ATTENDANT
D: ...Mind if I hold that Bible?
C: EARLY
D: What do you need a Bible for?
N: The attendant has no response.
C: EARLY
D: You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?
C: ATTENDANT
D: No sir.
N: Early takes the Bible off the desk and hands it down to the Attendant.
C: EARLY
D: Here you go.
N: The frightened young man lies face down on his stomach clutching the Bible and starts to pray. On the counter next to him Early notices a large stuffed "happy face" display. "Free with every 20 gallon purchase." He grabs one, stares at its face curiously.
C: EARLY
D: I wonder if Adele would like one of these? Nah...
E: mumbles to himself beat
N: Suddenly... He puts the barrel of the gun between the "happy face" eyes... Points it at the back of the attendant's head. Carrie begins to scream. Early pulls the trigger. The blast explodes the "happy face" and rips into the back of the Attendant's head, killing him.
S: INT. LINCOLN - SIMULTANEOUSLY
N: A thunderous crackle of lightning all but masks the gunshot. The rain starts pouring down.
C: BRIAN
D: What was that?
N: Adele stares blankly back.
S: INT. GAS STATION
N: The room fills with billowing down stuffing. As the stuffing floats to the floor it sticks to their hair, skin and clothes...
C: EARLY
D: What the fuck!
E: surprised at the feathers
S: INT. LINCOLN
N: Brian opens the door to leave.
S: EXT. GAS STATION
N: Early drags Carrie out of the office toward the car. Brian sees them running toward the car. They spill into the back seat. Brian sees Carrie is upset.
C: BRIAN
D: Carrie, what's wrong? Early, we went through this already, you have to leave.
E: to Early
N: From the back seat Early wipes some more feathers from his face, then points the Attendant's gun at Brian's head.
C: EARLY
D: 'Fraid not Bri'... Drive Adele.
E: spits out a feather
N: Adele starts the car. She pulls out of the station and into the rainstorm.
S: INT. GAS STATION
N: The last of the feathers fall like snow. The whole room is now white except for a red stain around the head of the dead Attendant.
S: INT. LINCOLN - A MOMENT LATER
N: The car moves down the highway. Early in the back seat is still trying to brush away feathers.
C: EARLY
D: Hate to be an Indian-giver but I'm gonna have to ask for my gun back.
N: Brian reaches in the glove compartment. He removes the gun and hands it to Early.
C: BRIAN
D: What happened back there?
E: to Early
N: Carrie sits in the corner of the back seat, covered in feathers but not even noticing them.
C: CARRIE
D: He shot him in the head... oh God!
N: Adele turns to the back of the car to face Carrie.
C: ADELE
D: He did not, you liar. Take that back.
E: raising her voice
N: The Lincoln swerves off onto the side of the road. Adele looks to the front again and steers it back onto the highway.
C: CARRIE
D: He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
C: EARLY
D: Everybody just shut up!
N: Early picks some more feathers off himself.
C: EARLY
D: You two just cooperate and do what I say, and we'll all arrive safe and sound in California, as planned... unless, of course, Adele don't kill us first with her driving.
N: NEW ANGLE - EXTREME CU The St. Christopher statue swings from the rear-view mirror. The windshield wipers sweep back and forth against the pouring rain.
S: EXT. AN ISOLATED ABANDONED STORE - NEXT MORNING
N: The Lincoln pulls up at the rear of the store. Adele exits carrying a couple of bags of Chinese take-out food.
S: INT. ABANDONED STORE
N: Adele enters the decrepit store. The others are inside. Brian and Carrie are tied up. Brian watches Early intently as he takes one of the bags from Adele. He begins opening one of the carry out containers.
C: EARLY
D: What the hell is this stuff?
C: ADELE
D: It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
N: Early opens another container. Stares curiously at the contents.
C: EARLY
D: Yeah but, what is it?
C: ADELE
D: I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
N: Early sets the container down.
C: EARLY
D: And just what exactly are the Chinese doing here in the middle of the American desert anyway?... Didja get the beer?
N: Adele somewhat reluctantly hands Early a bottle of beer from a second bag.
C: EARLY
D: ..."Chink" beer!
N: Early notices that Brian is watching him intently. He mistakes Brian's interest for hunger.
C: EARLY
D: Oh hell, I'm sorry Bri. Adele, honey, untie Brian, he's starving over there. Carrie, you want some?
E: pause
N: Carrie doesn't respond at all. Adele unties Brian. Early pulls out his gun, puts it on the table next to him. Brian sits across from Early. He watches as Early rummages impatiently through the carry out paraphernalia.
C: EARLY
D: Where's the damn forks and spoons at!
N: Frustrated, Early finally takes a gulp of Chinese food right out of the container. It goes down rough.
C: EARLY
D: ...Is it just me, or has this whole trip been goin' downhill ever since we ran outta Lucky Lager?
N: Brian picks up a pair of chopsticks, then reconsiders, puts them back down and, like Early, gulps from the container. NEARBY, Carrie sits quietly. As she listens to the two men talk... she notices something on her arm. She lifts her arm up to get a closer look. HER POV She sees that a few of the white down feathers still cling to her. Closer... and she sees that one of the tiny feathers is tinged with blood. The Gas Station Attendant's. It freaks her. ON BRIAN AND EARLY
C: BRIAN

C: EARLY
D: Well now, how many people d'you see me kill?

C: BRIAN
D: If you say so.
E: unconvincingly
C: EARLY
D: Damn right I do.

S: EXT. LINCOLN - TRAVELING - DAY INT. LINCOLN DRIVING DOWN BACKROADS - DAY

C: ADELE
D: Smile.
N: Neither makes any attempt at smiling. Adele snaps their photo anyway. In the front seat, she sits quietly for a moment then leans over to Early and whispers something to him.
C: EARLY
D: No way. I guarantee you he was breathing when I walked outta there.
N: Adele sits back quietly. Carrie wants to speak but doesn't.

E: to Adele, with a kiss to her cheek to Carrie
N: Pistol in hand, Early follows Brian down the hill. Adele begins nervously playing with her yoyo. Carrie watches as Brian and Early disappear around a bend in the dirt road. Out of the corner of her eye, she hones in on Adele's yoyo. Adele becomes increasingly intense about manipulating the yoyo, controlling it. Until she's lost in it. A momentary refuge.
C: ADELE
D: This is called walk the dog.
N: NEW ANGLE - EXTREME CU A huge excruciatingly tight shot of the yoyo in slow motion. Its string unraveling as it spins downward. Carrie pulls her gaze away.

S: EXT. LINCOLN
N: Carrie walks over to Adele at the car. Adele doesn't miss a beat with her yoyo.
C: CARRIE
D: Adele, listen to me... Early's sick; he should be in a hospital.
N: Adele screws up the trick. She pulls the yoyo off her finger and throws it in the back seat. She leans into the front seat and cranks the radio up to the max. Closing her eyes, she begins moving to the music, and tries to ignore Carrie.
C: CARRIE
D: The police are after him, he's a murderer!
E: shouting over the music

E: shouting
C: ADELE
D: Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
E: defensive
N: With that, Adele stops her dancing and turns away from Carrie... To see the Male Officer walking toward them.
C: ADELE
D: Please don't say anything Carrie.
N: The Male Officer continues toward them. It looks like he's talking to them... but his voice is inaudible under the deafening radio. NEW ANGLE: FAVORING THE TWO POLICE OFFICERS The Female Officer sticks her head out of the police car and yells to her partner. He turns to listen.
C: FEMALE OFFICER
D: We got a match, I'll call for back up.
N: As the Male Officer turns back, he sees Adele reach into the front seat of the Lincoln. The Male Officer draws his revolver and levels it at Adele. NEW ANGLE: FAVORING ADELE AND CARRIE Click! Adele shuts the radio off, total silence. As Adele leans back out of the car, she turns, facing directly into the barrel of the Male Officer's gun.
C: MALE OFFICER
D: All right ladies, I want both of you to slowly step away from the ca...
N: BANG! A single gunshot rings out! The Male Officer jerks back and falls to the ground. Adele screams! Carrie whips a panicked glance around and sees... Early running toward them. Brian, bewildered, follows behind. BRIAN'S POV (RUNNING) Ahead of him, he watches Early race past the wounded Male Officer. He kicks the Officer's revolver out of reach and rushes toward the police car. Early fires his gun repeatedly as he charges the car! The Female Officer pulls her gun and starts to get out of the car, when... a shot shatters the windshield hitting her in the chest. She collapses back onto the seat. ON BRIAN He stops at the sight of the wounded Male Officer. Shocked, he watches the man writhing in pain. His hands clutching his crotch. His blood oozes into the dirt.

C: POLICE RADIO
D: Officer needs help, shots fired, six Adam five, one eighty-seven, suspects wanted in multiple murders. Location unknown, last seen...
N: Brian is not sure what to do. He looks around... sees the Officer's handgun lying in the dirt. He takes a step toward it, when... another gunshot rings out! Brian stops. Looks to the police car. He sees Early standing there, smoke belching from the dashboard... the police radio is dead. Early walks back toward Brian and the others. He steps over to the injured Male Officer on the ground.
C: EARLY
D: Tell me that don't hurt.
N: Early picks up the wounded cop's gun. He hands it to Brian as he trains the .45 automatic at Brian's chest.
C: EARLY
D: Shoot him. You'll be doing him a favor.
N: Brian looks to Early in disbelief.
C: BRIAN
D: No, no, I can't.

E: excited
S: INT. STUDY - GLASS DISPLAY CASE
N: Early leans into frame, staring at the display case. EARLY'S POV Inside of it is a four foot long replica of the first ATOMIC BOMB, "Fat Boy." Faded newspaper articles on the wall indicate Mr. Musgrave had something to do with the bomb's initial construction. An old photo on the bookshelf shows a much younger Mr. Musgrave in a '50's kitchen. He is laughing and embracing a '50's style female mannequin.

Finally Adele reaches into her purse, pulls out her small potted cactus then walks across the room to a table. Its top is covered with small potted cacti. She gently places hers among them. ON MRS. MUSGRAVE Mrs. Musgrave begins to regain consciousness. Her eyes open to find... Adele standing over her. Adele brings her finger to her lips -- Shhhh.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM
N: Early looks through several more photos. He stops on one of a nude woman's torso. Early looks at it for a moment... then extends the photo out toward Carrie, comparing it to her.
C: EARLY
D: That's you ain't it?
E: smiles and shakes his head in disbelief
N: Carrie doesn't answer him. Then, in the background directly behind Early... Adele and Mrs. Musgrave quietly appear. Carrie notices them as they start to cross the hallway to the kitchen. Early sees Carrie's eyes glance past him. He turns to see why... when...
C: CARRIE

E: O.S.
N: Early stops. Looks back to Carrie. Brian also turns to her curiously.
C: CARRIE
D: ...It is me. Do you like it?

C: ADELE
D: Go on now... please.
N: Mrs. Musgrave is confused, is it a trick? She looks into Adele's eyes... and knows it's not. The old lady turns and walks out into the dark desert. Adele stands at the open door, watching Mrs Musgrave escape.

E: in a whisper
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

E: shouting
S: EARLY POV - EXT. CACTUS GARDEN

C: EARLY
D: Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
E: shouting over the gunfire
C: ADELE
D: Early! Stop!!
N: Desperate, Adele grabs a large potted cactus. She rushes toward Early. Swinging the cactus like an unwieldy bat, she pummels the side of his head. He stumbles forward, disappearing into the darkness. Adele stands outside the kitchen door, bewildered. Then...
C: EARLY
D: Oww! Oww!! -- FUCK!!!!
E: O.S.
N: Early re-emerges from the shadows. Adele's eyes widen when she sees him. His cheek has long bloody gashes where the cactus ripped the flesh.

E: perplexed
N: Adele starts to cry.
C: EARLY
D: Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.

D: Carrie, watch for Early.
C: CARRIE
D: What are you going to do?
C: BRIAN
D: I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.
N: Carrie glues her eyes to the kitchen doorway. Brian presses his back up under the belly of the piano and using all his strength manages to lift the piano an inch off the floor. Carrie slides her cuffs out from under the leg.
C: CARRIE
D: What about you?
C: BRIAN
D: I don't know.
N: Carrie's eyes dart back toward the kitchen. Then she notices a chair nearby.
C: CARRIE
D: Can you lift it again? Just lift it, hurry.
N: Carrie grabs the chair. As Brian lifts the piano, she pushes the chair beneath the underside of it. It holds the piano suspended an inch off the floor. Brian drops to the floor and slips the cuffs free. When... a solitary gunshot rings out from the cactus garden. A moment later, Early steps quietly into the room. He's pulling the last few cactus needles from his face. He sees Brian and Carrie standing.

C: CARRIE
D: I'll do whatever you want. You want me to go with you, I'll go with you. Just don't kill him.
N: Early deliberates the situation, then eases up off the trigger... and smiles to Brian. Then, without warning, he hits Brian over the head with the butt of the .45 automatic. Brian falls to the floor unconscious.
S: EXT. MUSGRAVE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
N: As Early finishes tieing one of the replicant bombs, Little Boy onto the hood. He reaches down and grabs a six pack of beer on the ground and shoves it in the back seat, then slides into the driver's seat next to an anxious Carrie. Carrie is now wearing one of Adele's floral dresses.

C: EARLY
D: Pass me a beer hon'.
N: Carrie quietly responds. She kneels on the front seat and reaches into the back. She grabs a bottle by its neck, and pulls it from the six pack of beer. Bottle in hand, she hesitates a moment... NEW ANGLE: EARLY'S POV IN THE DRIVING MIRROR Early watches Carrie.
C: EARLY
D: You wanna hit me with that, huh?
N: NEW ANGLE Carrie reconsiders and sits back in the far corner of the front seat.

S: EXT. DESERT - LATER
N: The wind has picked up. An old wooden gate blocks the fire road. On either side, barbed wire as far as the eye can see. The Lincoln roars into frame and powers through the barrier. The gate smashes into splintered pieces of wood.
S: INT. LINCOLN - SAME TIME
N: Carrie leans against the passenger door. Early's eyes scan the open desert -- looking for the elusive 'doors.' Carrie reaches for her pack of cigarettes.

The temperature gauge is in the red.
S: EXT. DESERT

S: EXT. DESERT - LATER, THE SUN IS ON THE HORIZON
N: The winds continue to escalate, blowing harder and harder. The Lincoln approaches on the fire road. A trail of steam is streaming out from under the hood, blinding Early's view. Finally, Early slams on the brakes and skids 180 degrees to a halt... Steam pours out of the Lincoln's grill. The Lincoln has had it. Early is indifferent and looks around. About a hundred yards away, barely visible through the growing sand storm, an old 1950's style building.
S: INT. LINCOLN
N: Early opens the back door. He grabs a box of supplies (some rope, a kerosene lamp etc.)

C: EARLY
D: Howdy, my name's Early Grayce and this is my girl Carrie. I hope you don't mind us bargin' in like this but a... we was on our way to California when our car broke down, and...
N: EARLY'S POV (AS HE EXPLAINS) A living room fully decorated in '50's furniture. Sand covers everything... Including... A FAMILY OF FOUR MANNEQUINS placed around the room: The father sits in front of the TV... The mother (the same mannequin as in Mr. Musgrave's old picture) is toppled over a kitchen counter... The little girl is seated at a table... The little boy is playing with his toy plane on the floor.
C: EARLY

NEW ANGLE On a collapsed old wooden sign. It lies on the ground a few feet away from the gate posts. "DREAMLAND" - NUCLEAR TEST RANGE DANGER - KEEP OUT
S: INT. '50'S DESERT HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Wind and sand blow freely through the remains of the windows. A solitary kerosene lamp dimly illuminates the living room area. Its flickering light finds... Early, stripped to the waist, crouched over the broken TV set. He fidgets with the knobs. Then the mangled rabbit ears antenna. Carrie sits on some blankets in the corner next to the couch. She's scared to death. Her eyes scan the battered room. Debris everywhere. Amidst all of it, Carrie's erotic photographs have been placed about the room. ON EARLY Still unable to get the TV to work, he smacks it a good one on the side. With the smack!... Carrie whips her look back toward Early... To find he's lost interest in the TV. He turns toward Carrie. Stares at her for a moment. Then with a hint of a smile, he begins to move toward her. The time has arrived. He reaches down, grabs her by the shirt and pulls her to her feet. Carrie doesn't resist. He's rough with her as he kisses her on the lips. Carrie pulls her mouth away from his. She seems confused, unsure of her feelings. Early watches her, until her eyes come back to his. Then she steps forward crowding her body against his, as she slips one hand around his neck and kisses him deep and hard... Suddenly Early breaks the kiss and backhands Carrie hard across the face. She lands on the floor several feet away, the palm of her right hand is bleeding. Early looks down to his waist to find a large piece of glass protruding from his side. He pulls the glass shard out, blood drips down his side and onto his jeans. Carrie gets up and races into the back bedroom, frantically looking for a way out, there is none. On the bed the two adult mannequins now lie naked. They have been placed, intertwined in a grotesque sexual position. Carrie turns and rushes back toward the door. Early intercepts her and throws a punch to her stomach, which doubles her over. Then Early sends a second punch to her face, she stumbles backward, landing onto the bed amongst the mannequins. Early begins undoing his belt.
C: EARLY
D: You'll like it...
E: friendly
N: A violent gust of wind sends several of the erotic photos swirling through the air. One of the photos whips across Early's chest. The wind holds it there momentarily.
C: EARLY
D: Not a lot, but you'll like it.
N: Early peels Carrie's photo off him, the blood from his wound covers the back of it. He slaps it against the nearest wall. It sticks. He walks toward her.
S: INT. PICKUP TRUCK - BRIAN'S POV
N: The high winds have turned into a full fledged sandstorm. Brian is still driving dangerously fast. The dim lights of the old pickup illuminate only a short stretch of dirt road ahead and the swirling sand. He passes a road sign: 'DEVASTATION DRIVE' Then... As the pickup truck comes around a corner Suddenly... directly in front of him -- Headlights!! Brian reacts... too late!! The pickup truck ploughs into the vehicle, and tumbles end over end through the open desert, before finally coming to an abrupt halt.
S: INT. '50'S DESERT HOUSE - NIGHT
N: With each thrust of Early's body, Carrie's badly bruised face contorts with pain and hatred
T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. DESERT
N: Sand blows in through the smashed windshield of the wrecked pickup truck. Brian is upside down with his eyes shut. A trickle of blood runs down his face. Camera booms up a dirt slope to reveal the Lincoln, beyond it on the hill above sits the desert house. The glow of the kerosene lamp is visible through the windows.
T: FADE OUT:
S: EXT. DESERT HOUSE - DAWN
N: The storm is over... No sand blowing. No wind. No nothing. COMPLETE SILENCE!!!! The dawn light reveals the devastated '50's house to be one of a cluster, set at the end of a 'Doom Town' cul-de-sac.
S: INT. '50'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
N: In the darkened bedroom, Early's solitary figure rustles atop the bed. Slowly, he awakens. His eyes open. Across the bed, a pair of handcuffs is locked around the bedpost. In the other cuff is Carrie's motionless hand. Then, out of the corner of his eye, Early sees something in one of the nearby rooms. Curious, he stands, shoves the .45 automatic in his waistband and walks toward the hallway. As he passes through the living room and enters the hallway, his face contorts with a strange sense of wonderment. EARLY'S POV A blinding light is shafting through cracks and broken gaps around the front door frame... It looks like a magical "door" shrouded in a wall of light! ON EARLY In disbelief he pulls his gaze away from the "door"... and sees through a window at the opposite end of the house... the morning sun rising. With that he turns his attention back to the front door!
C: EARLY
D: I knew there was doors out here!
N: He walks toward the doorway of light. He grins as he opens the "door" and steps through it. The sunlight momentarily blinding him. EARLY'S POV A black shadow hurtles toward him out of the brightness... Eventually it blocks out all the light until... WHAAMM!!!!
S: EXT. DOOR
N: A blow knocks Early back through the doorway. He slams to the ground, on his back. The gun falls from his jeans and slides across the floor. A look of joyful amazement over the blood covered remains of his face, he tries to get up, but can't. EARLY'S POV Brian, silhouetted, steps into the doorway. He holds a shovel raised, ready to deliver a second, fatal blow... but when he sees Early incapacitated on the floor, he lowers the shovel to his side. His handcuffed hands reach down and picks up Early's gun. He trains it on Early, then walks around him to enter the house. Brian's eyes slowly adjust to the interior... EARLY'S POV From on his back, Early looks out the open "door." He sees two large shards of glass standing vertical in the sand, reflecting the sun's rays back toward the house. He realizes that the glass, placed there by Brian, is what created the effect of the "door." He starts to laugh.
C: EARLY
D: That was damn tricky of you Bri.
E: laughing
N: Brian searches for Carrie.
C: BRIAN
D: Carrie... Carrie... it's over.
N: ON BRIAN He moves into the back bedroom and finds Carrie. She is crouched on the floor, handcuffed to the bedframe. He moves to help her. As he gets closer, he sees her badly bruised face and realizes what's taken place throughout the night. Brian stops. The sympathetic expression on his face changes. With hatred in his eyes, he pivots around, strides out of the bedroom and moves toward the front of the house to Early. in the front room Gun in hand, Brian rushes back into the room. He wields the pistol toward the ground where Early lay... but Early's not there. Brian's eyes dart around the room... then suddenly, from behind him, Early grabs him! He wrenches Brian's head back and whips his belt buckle knife toward his throat! Brian manages to lift his hands to his neck an instant before the knife tears through his flesh. The knife slices a vicious wound across the back of Brian's right hand. He drops the gun to the floor. Brian elbows Early in the ribs and pulls away from him. He reaches to the ground for the gun, but Early kicks him in the stomach and sends him crumbling to his knees.
C: EARLY
D: Go ahead Bri, ask me something. You wanna know how I'm feeling'? Well I'd say I'm feelin' pretty damn good.
E: beat
N: On all fours, Brian reaches out for the gun, but Early kicks it across the room.
C: EARLY
D: How 'bout you? You feelin' good?
N: Another kick to Brian's chest. The wind rushes out of him.
C: EARLY
D: ...'Cause you sure don't look so good. Or maybe you're feelin'... powerful. That it, you feeling powerful? Superior? I know I am.
E: beat
N: Early unloads a ferocious kick to the side of Brian's face! His head snaps back, his handcuffed arms buckle and he falls flat to the ground.
C: EARLY
D: What? Am I angry with my daddy? Now why would I be angry with my daddy... you're the one hit me with the shovel. And you're the one's gonna wish you hadn't.
N: With one last effort, Brian manages to pull himself back up to his knees. He focuses on the gun ahead of him and tries to crawl toward it. But Early's foot shoves Brian. He flips over onto his back, landing in front of the bedroom doorway. Early moves toward him, knife in hand. As Early moves toward Brian, unexpectedly from inside the doorway, the torso of the female child mannequin whips past. Her hardened molten face slams into Early's bloodied face. Early stumbles backward. Brian crawls for the gun and grabs it. From his knees he turns, steadies the weapon, takes a quick breath... and fires. Hitting Early square in the chest! Early falls to the ground on his back. Brian lifts himself to his feet. He sees that Carrie has dragged the bedframe to the doorway, and in her free hand she holds the child mannequin by the leg. Gun in hand, Brian steps over to Early. Early's body is still. Blood oozes from the hole in his chest. On a silver chain around his neck is the key to Brian and Carrie's handcuffs. Brian reaches down and grabs the keys... when suddenly Early's arm springs up from his side. His hand grabs Brian's shirt collar. Brian is startled by the move, then realizes that Early's hold is weak. His fingers tremble. Finally his arm drops back down to his side.
C: EARLY
D: Hey Bri... I think I need a doctor. What d'ya say?
N: The two men stare at one another for a moment... then Brian, with one hand still on the handcuff keys, shoves the .45 automatic firmly under Early's chin. CLOSE ON BRIAN
C: BRIAN
D: ...Sorry 'bout this Early.
N: o.s. BANG!! rings out as... CLOSE UP on the chain and keys snapping free from Early's neck. CLOSE UP on Brian's handcuffs hitting the dusty wooden floor. CLOSE UP on Carrie's handcuff swinging empty against the rusty bedpost.
