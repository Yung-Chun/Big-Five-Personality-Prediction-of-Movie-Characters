T: FADE IN:
N: LANDSCAPES A rusted Chevy El Camino drives against dissolving Louisiana landscapes - broad, barren, pounded by the rain. I/E. EL CAMINO, TRAVELING - DUSK Occasional oncoming headlights illuminate the driver's face: Tense, course features, thick beard... He's BUD CARTER, 31. AN INTERSTATE SIGN PASSES ON THE RIGHT: "WHISKEY BAY" Bud pulls onto a dirt road, into a TRAILER PARK and stops.
S: INT. DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER - DUSK

C: GRACE

C: BUD
D: Tell you what... Bag 'em all. The market's got a hard-on for this shit.
C: GRACE
D: I hear that. Jake, get on it.
E: across the room
N: ACROSS THE ROOM are two other men -- JAKE and DOUG. Ex-cons at a table, riffing through Bud's cash. A CURTAIN YANKS BACK and RAY WHEELER, 29, enters. Dope-thin, bloodshot eyes. He looks at Bud. Bud looks at him... Ray clicks on the TV and opens a beer. TV IN: Evening news. The storm outside alters the reception.
C: NEWSCASTER
D: ...And today, thirty-one year old Gary Plauche pleaded innocent by reason of insanity, to charges of second-degree murder in the slaying of accused sex offender, Jeffrey Doucett.
N: Bud watches Ray empty a gram of coke onto the bar. Using a credit card, Ray starts chopping lines. The SOUND continues throughout the scene...
C: NEWSCASTER
D: ...District Court Judge Frank Salia, scheduled the trial one year to the day after Doucett was first arrested.
E: TV
N: Grace hefts a lock box to the counter, removes a drawer of emeralds. Bud SEES packed carelessly underneath, uncut DIAMONDS.
C: BUD
D: What do you got there? Diamonds?
C: GRACE
D: That's thirty grand. Out the door. You interested?
C: BUD
D: Ain't got the scratch right now. But I am interested.
N: And the volume of the TV now becomes more apparent...
C: NEWSCASTER O.S.
D: ...As a result of numerous threats made weeks ago, tight security surrounded the courthouse. However, missing from today's hearing, was the arresting officer.
N: Bud has been tuning out the TV distraction... until that last statement. He sneaks a look.
C: NEWSCASTER
D: From East Baton Rouge Sheriff's office...
N: A wave of static scrambles the picture. When it clears...
C: NEWSCASTER O.S.
D: ...Police Lieutenant, Bud Carter.
N: Bud is stunned. HIS OWN FACE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN. A younger photo of Bud, clean shaven - DRESSED IN POLICE UNIFORM.
S: EXT. TRAILER PARK - SAME
N: Rain pours. A beat-up PLUMBER'S VAN is parked in the distance.
S: INT. GRACE'S TRAILER - SAME
N: TV IN: Signal wavers. It's archive footage of Baton Rouge Airport. A prisoner, JEFFREY DOUCETT, escorted by police.
C: NEWSCASTER
D: Doucett was being extradited to Baton Rouge.
N: Ray does a line of coke, keeps chopping. Watches the TV. Grace is bagging emeralds. Jake and Doug count cash. Bud keeps the TV in sight. Quick glances. Mind racing. TV IN: The procession moves past a row of pay phones. At one phone, a discreet figure, GARY PLAUCHE, turns...
C: NEWSCASTER
D: The victim's father, Gary Plauche, stood waiting at the terminal. As Doucett walked by, Plauche turned, raised a handgun...and fired.
N: Bud's vision is suddenly obscured when Grace steps forward with the emeralds in a satchel.
C: GRACE
D: Here you go. Fifteen three-karat blues. Wholesale. Twenty large.
N: Sudden GUNSHOTS and SCREAMS on the TV. Everyone turns... TV IN: Jeffrey Doucett lies dead as POLICE wrestle Gary Plauche to the ground amid chaos.
C: NEWSCASTER
D: Lieutenant Carter was unavailable for comment.
N: TIGHT ON RAY'S EYES, intense, watching the footage. As Bud stuffs the satchel in his coat, WE SEE what Ray sees... TV IN: Bud, POLICE BADGE AROUND HIS NECK, arresting Plauche. ON RAY, slow burn realization as he looks from the tv to Bud. And again. EYES LOCK, THEY BOTH KNOW.
C: RAY
D: Motherfucker, he's a cop.
N: Bud yanks a .45. And everything happens at once. A SUDDEN GUNSHOT and Jake FIRES again. Wood splinters as Bud FIRES back. Jake is HIT in the throat. A SECOND SHOT in the forehead - he SLAMS against the window, cracking it...
S: INT. PLUMBER'S VAN - SAME
N: Among surveillance equipment, sits Bud's crew: TODD SHEPARD, DAVID MARANDINO and DALE COBB. Gunshots ECHO.
C: SHEPARD
D: Fuck! Go! Go!
N: Marandino, behind the wheel, SLAMS his foot on the gas.
S: INT. GRACE'S TRAILER - SAME
N: A SHOT ZIPS across Bud's back; he SPINS off the table. On his knees, Doug is firing a .32. BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM. Bud FIRES a burst through Doug's chest, dropping him. A HOLE EXPLODES beside Bud's head -- Grace FIRING a .45 -- as Ray SCREAMS and runs out the door.
S: EXT. TRAILER PARK, VAN - SAME
N: Marandino winds through gears, as Ray hits the yard running... POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: Marandino swings the wheel hard, SLAMS INTO RAY -- launching him through trash bins, into the mud. Cobb jumps from the van and pounds Ray into handcuffs. Simultaneously, Shepard sprints for the trailer door...
S: EXT. GRACE'S TRAILER PARK - SAME
N: Grace explodes from the back door, bolting across the yard. I/E. GRACE'S TRAILER - SAME Bud scrambles on the floor of the demolished trailer. .45 held tight, he runs out after Grace. ACROSS THE YARD the chase rages. MOVING WITH GRACE as he jumps a link fence, lands and trips into a roll of chicken wire. His sleeve catches, rips as he pulls free... MOVING WITH BUD at a searing pace. He slips in the mud. Staggers up. SEES Grace disappear in the shadows. Grace throws himself against the side of a power unit. Eyes darting. Wheezing hard... Tries to slow his breath. Then turns the corner... GRACE'S POV: A SHOVEL swings from around the corner, WHAM!!! The blow sends Grace sailing back. He SLAMS on the ground, with a blood-covered broken face. As he tries to get up... Bud's gun is there. And like that, it stops.
S: INT. SOUTHDOWN'S BAR - AFTER HOURS
N: At a table, the METRO SQUAD: Bud, Shepard, Marandino, Cobb are drinking. A bartender (SHERRY) is wiping down glasses...

S: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH JAIL - DAY
N: Bud smokes, standing with Shepard in semi-darkness. They're looking through a two-way mirror into an INTERROGATION ROOM, where Cobb interviews Ray Wheeler.
C: RAY
D: I told you... I keep tellin' you... I don't know nothin'. That's it.
C: COBB
D: That's not it. We've been here all morning. We'll stay here all night.
N: Bud paces to a neighboring INTERROGATION ROOM where Marandino is questioning Grace (bruised face, swollen, broken nose).
C: MARANDINO
D: The stones you were fencin' belonged to an Amsec wall safe in "Kay's Jewelers". The rest from a vault in Bocage. Both owners can verify their belongings, and have. Who you fencin' for?
E: beat

D: Man, I ain't sayin' fuckin' shit.
C: MARANDINO
D: Then your name's on a dozen other jobs, just like it.
C: GRACE
D: That's bullshit.
C: MARANDINO
D: No, that's a promise.
N: Bud, sipping coffee, paces back to Ray's interview...
C: COBB
D: We got a series of burglaries in the area. All over the last six months. All still open. You don't talk, it's on you.
C: RAY
D: Well I ain't got nothin' to do with that.
C: COBB
D: Any idea who does?
C: RAY
D: No! Okay? Fuck no.
N: Bud sets down his coffee, calm.
S: INT. GRACE'S INTERROGATION ROOM
N: Marandino sits across from Grace, clearly frustrated.
C: MARANDINO
D: ...Answer the question.
C: GRACE
D: MAN FUCK THIS! AND FUCK YOU! Y'ALL CREW'S JUST FAGGOTS IN MATCHING JACKETS!
E: exploding
N: The door blasts open. Bud charges in, throws Grace against the wall, then slams his face onto the table, pushing down.
C: BUD
D: Try this. I know you're too fuckin' dumb to be any more than a courier. I know you're coverin' for someone else. NOW TELL ME WHO THAT SOMEONE IS!
C: GRACE
D: I ain't a rat!
C: BUD
D: YOU AIN'T A RAT?!
N: Bud twists his broken nose. Grace SCREAMS.
C: MARANDINO
D: Easy, Bud. Go easy.
C: GRACE
D: STOP THIS SHIT! STOP HIM!
E: to Marandino
N: Marandino puts a hand on Bud's shoulder; Bud shoves him off.
C: BUD
D: LOCK THE DOOR!
N: Marandino locks it. Bud turns Grace's nose even harder, nearly rips it off his face.
C: BUD
D: I'll teach you what commitment is... I'll throw you in an eight by nine and have you fucked in the ass by every inmate in the state of Louisiana-- AND THAT'S THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!
N: Grace, spitting blood now. Choking. Bud twists. Bone cracks.

N: Jesse stops at a pump. Suddenly, Bud appears at the window and jams a SHOTGUN against Jesse's head.
C: BUD
D: Don't move. You motherfuck, I'll blow your head clean off.
N: Reflecting in the side-view: Bud's BADGE swings from his neck. Jesse's eyes resign to relief. Bud SEES this...
C: BUD
D: Shut the car off slowly.
N: With several law enforcement shotguns now leveled at him from all directions, Jesse turns off his engine.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. JESSE WHEELER'S HOUSE - MORNING
N: Bud, Shepard, Cobb and Marandino, vests and shotguns, move in unison around the house. Bud and Cobb stay to the shadows, down a side yard... Shepard, Marandino reach the front door. Locked. A tv plays quietly inside. No one in the windows. Shepard signals to Marandino...
S: INT. JESSE WHEELER'S HOUSE
N: THE FRONT DOOR IS KICKED DOWN. Shepard and Marandino spill in, guns ready...
C: SHEPARD
D: POLICE! WARRANT!

D: WE GOT A WARRANT!

N: Lynn suddenly gasps agitatedly, sinks to the floor. A GUSH OF FLUID soaks through her dress.

N: Bud and Cobb enter from a back door, hurry towards Lynn. Bud lowers Lynn to the floor.
C: BUD
D: CALL AN AMBULANCE! NOW!
E: to Cobb
T: BEDROOM - TIME CUT
N: A door slams open to reveal... A NAZI IRON EAGLE BATTLE FLAG. Draped across the far wall. Windows taped over. Walls painted black. Military surplus on every shelf and surface. Helmets. Uniforms. Body armor. Bayonets. Bud in the doorway. Shepard joins him.
C: BUD
D: Toss everything.
T: SMASH CUT TO:
N: Several COPS(now on scene) ransack the house. Ripping open cabinets, drawers, tossing everything to the floor... GARAGE Cobb flips a switch. A lamp illuminates a workbench.
C: COBB
D: Alright, I want everything seized!
N: Cabinets, lockers and tool boxes slam open. Cops stop cold, blown away by what they see: GUNS. Everywhere. LIVING ROOM COP #1 feels behind a couch. He finds a .38, then a COLT .25 below a chair cushion. BATHROOM COP #2 removes the toilet's basin cover. With a pen, he removes a dripping .357. KITCHEN Several STATE TROOPERS lead Jesse in, cuff him to a table. ATTIC Floor peels back. Flashlights illuminate: AMMUNITION BOXES. ASSAULT RIFLES. GRENADES. BONDS and COUNTERFEIT PLATES.

C: SHEPARD
D: God damn...there's some weight.
N: KITCHEN Bud takes a seat at the table... For the first time, we get a good look at Jesse Wheeler: Cold eyes. Handlebar mustache. Covered in tats. With a boilermaker's build, he looks what he is... DANGEROUS.
C: BUD
D: I'm Detective Lieutenant Bud Carter, of the East Baton Rouge Parish Precinct. So how you like Baton Rouge?
E: smiles
N: Jesse's stare drifts to Bud. It's deadly. Cabinets slam open and closed. Dishes hit the floor.
C: JESSE
D: What happened to my wife?
C: BUD
D: Water broke. She's en route to the hospital.
N: COP #3 is searching the refrigerator. Jesse watches as if he's seen something we haven't... Cop #3 moves on... Jesse sees Bud's eyes. They connect with his own... Bud opens the fridge. He scans condiments then stops. From inside a bag of HOT DOG BUNS, several sealed VIALS.
C: BUD
D: This is new.
N: Bud examines a vial's label: "CYANIDE."
C: BUD
D: What's the cyanide for, Jesse?
C: JESSE
D: Extracting impurities.
N: Bud, right with him, grins.
C: BUD
D: Impurities from what?
N: Jesse, calm. Deadpan.
C: BUD
D: You're in a bad situation here, pal.
C: JESSE
D: I'll make bond.
N: Bud looks in Jesse's eyes and believes it. BEDROOM Shepard, searching the room. Drawers, cabinets. Then leans down to peer under the bed... ...stops, stunned when he SEES: a row of live Goex charges in packing, boldly marked: EXPLOSIVES
C: SHEPARD
D: OUT! EVERYONE OUT! GET THE FUCK OUT!
E: top of his lungs
S: INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY
N: MIKE BRADDOCK (40s), Captain of Detectives, enters his office. Bud tows, carrying files.

T: INTERCUT:
S: INT. PROCESSING ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY
N: ON A CAMERA FLASH. Mug shots of Jesse's front and profile.

S: INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY
C: BUD
D: There's more, I know it.
N: Bud slaps a file on Braddock's desk, to a crime scene photo: An Asian JUDGE sits dead in the front seat of his car.
C: BUD
D: Remember him? Ten months ago, a judge gets popped with a .357. Well I got a Ruger from Wheeler's toilet and rushed it through ballistics.
C: BRADDOCK
D: And?
C: BUD
D: It's a solid match! Dead on.
C: BRADDOCK
D: There's a dozen ways Wheeler could've got that burner. It don't prove a thing.

N: Meanwhile...
C: BRADDOCK
D: So who's backin' him?
C: BUD
D: I don't know; I do know they'll post his bond. That's why I need a price they can't come up with overnight.
N: Braddock listens. Bud keeps it on track...
C: BUD
D: I'm right about this, Mike. When a guy's lookin' at two hundred years and he ain't upset... It's like when your wife is accusing you of fuckin' the neighbor, but she don't know you're fuckin' her sister too. You're pretty calm about it, right?
E: leans close
N: Braddock smiles slightly.
C: BUD
D: It's 'cause we hit the wrong nerve. The guns, the other shit, the time... He can have that conversation. And he is. And he ain't upset. He's makin' eye contact, 'cause we're fallin' short. This guy knows things. He knows where bodies are.
E: the bottom line
N: Braddock, thinks; Then--
C: BRADDOCK
D: I'll bounce it up to the D.A.
N: Bud grins, SLAMS his hand on the desk.
S: INT. HOLDING AREA, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DUSK
N: Two GUARDS escort Jesse. He's bound in chains, orange scrubs.
S: INT. HOLDING CELL
N: End of the hall. A BLACK PRISONER waits, arms slung over the crossbars with a cigarette. Jesse is brought forth. A Guard unlocks the cell. The Black Prisoner steps back, joining TWO OTHERS: All black, looming in the darkness. Jesse steps in. Guards unlock his shackles. Chains hit the floor. Behind him, the bars slam home. SILENCE...LONG, DRAWN SILENCE. THEN:
C: JESSE
D: My name is Jesse Wheeler... I'm now in charge of this cell. Any y'all don't like it, step your black ass forward, line up.
N: A MOMENT. Cued by Jesse's challenge, each of the prisoners slowly rise, vehemently approaching...

N: Bud and Murphy descend steps to a grim CORRIDOR.
C: CHARLIE V.O.
D: All them prison gangs in the world... Black Panthers, Mexican Mafia, forget it. The AB is deadly as it gets. And Jesse Wheeler was their ring leader.
N: The PHONE CONVERSATION fades out... Presently:
C: BUD
D: So what the fuck happened?

N: Murphy stops outside a solid steel door.
C: MURPHY
D: I'll tell you somethin', Bud. After it happened, our block was the quietest it'd ever been. Wish we had ten just like him.
C: BUD
D: Open the door.
S: INT. ISOLATION CELL - CONTINUOUS
N: Bud enters. Murphy shuts the door and a series of locks BOLT. We're in a stone closet. No bed or sink. No light.
C: BUD
D: Heard you refused a public defender.
N: Jesse's bruised face moves through shadow.
C: BUD
D: At the gas station...When you were arrested, I put a gun to your head. You expected someone else.
C: JESSE
D: You don't look like cops.
C: BUD
D: And your house? Guns. Mass supply tells me, intent to sell. Cyanide in the fridge, explosives...tells me you're scared.
N: Jesse's eyes emerge from the dark. Bud, looking right at him.
C: BUD
D: I know who you are.
C: JESSE
D: If you knew that much, you wouldn't be in here alone.
N: Bud smiles and walks to the door.
C: BUD
D: One more thing, pal. I saw the judge this morning. There is no bond.
E: grins
N: HOLD on Jesse. Bud BANGS on the door. Locks UNLATCH. The door opens and Bud steps calmly out to the hall... The door shuts with a BOOM, locking Jesse in. And the nail in the coffin resonates.

D: What can I do y'all for?
C: CATFISH
D: How come the Wheeler brothers, is locked up? And you ain't?
C: GRACE
D: Wheeler brothers is locked up? I don't know nothin' about that.

D: Well there ain't no "different" to hear, Catfish. 'Cause I ain't talked to neither of 'em.
C: CATFISH
D: But you did talk to someone.
N: Buzz moves. Grace turns to look... ...In a blink, Catfish's gun comes up: ONE QUICK POP. A .45 with a thick, barrel silencer. The mirror shatters. Grace's knees hit the floor. His head hits the sink, HOLDS. As blood runs from one small hole. Catfish straightens up in the next mirror. Tucks his shirt. Grace's body sags to the floor. Catfish and Buzz walk out.
S: INT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY
N: LOUD BUZZER. Two GUARDS #1 and #2 march Jesse down the tier. On his left, PRISONERS in cells, TURN, STARE and WHISPER. Jesse arrives at a cell. GUARD #1 (calls out) Open ninety-six! BARS slide back. Jesse walks in. His CELL-MATE steps cautiously from the shadows... IT'S RAY. Pale and nervous. Jesse stands over him. The brothers' eyes connect. And there's a moment...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. EXERCISE YARD, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY
N: High stone walls topped with concertina wire. Looming guard towers. Thick FOG blankets the yard filled with CONVICTS. Jesse takes hold of a metal bar, lifts it from a bench press. He does two reps. The weights BANG down and Jesse sits up.
C: RAY O.S.
D: This place is bad...
N: Ray adds weight to the already excessive amount. He sweats as he talks nervously over Jesse's shoulder...
C: RAY
D: There's eyes everywhere. Like I got a sign on my back, Jesse, they all think I talked.
N: Jesse scans numerous WHITE CONS watching the Wheeler brothers.
C: RAY
D: Just the other day... some spic fish got hit with a weight. Ten other cons, they beat him and stabbed him till there weren't nothin' left. And the guards let it happen.
N: Ray fastens the safety collars and Jesse leans back.
C: RAY
D: His brains were on the wall, Jesse. Like somebody painted 'em.
N: Jesse does another set. Weights BANG down. He slowly sits up.
C: JESSE
D: They come at you?
C: RAY
D: Not yet... But it's in the mail. I can feel it fuckin' coming.
N: Ray shoots a look at a group of ARYAN BROTHERS across the yard. CZAPP, their "leader," and ROACH. Jesse turns. Czapp looks at him. Eyes meet. Jesse leans back. The press shakes as Jesse does a last set. His red strained face as the bar lands with a CRASH.
S: INT. YARD CORRIDOR, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY,
N: LATER A long line of prisoners are filing back through the gate. Ray, behind Jesse. Says low:
C: RAY
D: Hey, Jesse... Sorry I put you back here. I never meant--
E: silence
C: JESSE
D: "Sorry", Raymond...? You ain't sorry. I took you into my home. I tried to clean you up. And you steal from me...? You take my fuckin' diamonds? 'Cause of you, I missed the birth of my son.
E: turns pause dead to rights
N: Ray swallows hard. Nothing he can say.
S: INT. METRO OFFICE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY
N: CLOSE ON numerous files of ARYAN GANG MEMBERS. Arrest sheets, paperwork and photos.
C: BUD O.S.
D: Alright, let's work this... In prison, Wheeler is credited for the expansion of the Brotherhood. When Federal split up members, they had to reorganize. So they tattooed their blood types and serial numbers on one another.
E: beat
C: COBB O.S.
D: Recede and multiply.
C: BUD O.S.
D: Exactly...
N: REVEAL NOW Bud and Shepard with Cobb and Marandino around a table, used as a converted eating area.
C: BUD
D: Put 'em in prison, they get stronger. Everywhere you send one, they recruit in numbers. Within five years, their numbers were over ten thousand.
C: MARANDINO
D: Wheeler directed all that, huh?
N: Shepard is flipping through a worn, thick file.
C: BUD
D: What do you got there, Shep'?
C: SHEPARD
D: Interpol wired us files on three known Aryan leaders in the state of Louisiana: Edgar Bingham. Harold Kay. And this man... Lucian Adams.
N: He opens the file, revealing mugshots of LUCIAN ADAMS, 51. Dark eyes. Sharp, gun metal features.
C: SHEPARD
D: High priest of the Aryan National Party. His "ministry" of Christian Identity and Paramilitary Order has stood for over a decade. Check this out...
N: Shepard pulls an old, faded surveillance photo: (Long shot) Lucian talking to a young Jesse outside a compound.
C: SHEPARD
D: Wheeler was just seventeen when he met Lucian at the Patriotic Congress.
C: MARANDINO
D: No shit.
C: SHEPARD
D: Today, Lucian's one hell of an entrepreneur. Owns surplus stores. Demolition. A piping business. Got trucks runnin' all across the God damn country.
N: Bud's been quiet; says now:
C: BUD
D: Stay focused. Get back to Wheeler... I need an angle.
C: COBB
D: For what? If Wheeler ever flipped, news would spread like wildfire. The AB's gonna know about it. They'd gonna know about it nationally. Pass the sugar.
E: re: his coffee
N: Marandino does.
C: BUD
D: That's if he was a surface informant. I don't want him to testify. I want to keep him on the street. Look, this guy's been in it a long time. He's up to his elbows; wants to shake his hands free. I can feel it.
E: to the group
C: MARANDINO
D: Braddock ain't gonna go for this.
C: BUD
D: I'll handle that.
N: Everyone looks to Bud.
C: BUD
D: We got one chance here. 'Cause if this falls short... Jesse Wheeler's worth more dead than alive.
S: INT. CAFETERIA, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - EVENING
N: A sea of tables divided by race as far as the eye can see. Jesse and Ray, trays in hand, find an island of ARYAN PRISONERS. They quickly part to make room for Jesse to sit. Suddenly Czapp and Roach arrive with their trays and abruptly sit across from the Wheeler brothers.
C: CZAPP
D: How you doin', Ray? We was just over there wonderin' why you ain't got the courtesy to introduce us to your kin.
E: off Ray's look
C: RAY
D: I was gonna.
C: CZAPP
D: I'm sure you was.
E: grins
N: Czapp locks on Jesse, who calmly eats, not looking up.
C: CZAPP
D: Jesse Wheeler. Heard of you...
C: ROACH
D: Fuckin-A, heard a lot.
C: CZAPP
D: Name's Czapp... You can call me, "Bossman." I kept an eye on your brother the past few days for you. Ain't that right, Ray?
E: beat
C: RAY
D: Yeah...
E: low
C: JESSE
D: My brother ain't none of your business.
C: CZAPP
D: Ain't none of my business, "Bossman." And everything in this fuckin' place is my business.
N: Ray nervously glances down at several Aryans watching...
C: CZAPP
D: Listen to me, you sonofabitch. I'm gonna make one God damn thing God damn clear. Your reputation is smoke. Whatever they say you is or once was, I don't give a flyin' fuck. 'Cause it's my say-so now. And your fuckin' brother's up for grabs.
E: to Jesse
N: Czapp looks away from Jesse and shouts down the table:
C: CZAPP
D: Y'all got that?!
N: Suddenly Jesse SPRINGS. A headbutt EXPLODES Czapp's nose and throws him back. Czapp's head hits linoleum, echoing with a CRACK!! He lies still. Bloodied and unconscious.
C: ROACH
D: Fuck...
E: stumbles away, shocked
N: A DEAFENING SILENCE SPREADS OVER THE CAFETERIA. Jesse calmly resumes eating. Czapp's blood covers his face. SUDDENLY AN ALARM BLARES. GUARDS pour in, led by Murphy. INMATES HIT THE DECK, arms behind their heads. All except Jesse, who continues to eat.
C: MURPHY
D: WHEELER!!! Stand the fuck up! Hands behind your head!
N: Jesse rises.
C: MURPHY
D: Hands behind your head! Get on the fuckin' floor!
N: Jesse puts his hands behind his head, but does not kneel. Restraints are slammed on Jesse's wrists. And we...
T: CUT TO BLACK.
S: INT. ISOLATION, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - LATE NIGHT
N: The door unlocks and drags open. Jesse turns, blinking painfully into the light ...Sees an imposing DUTY GUARD.
C: DUTY GUARD
D: Phone call.
S: INT. GUARD STATION
N: Jesse is led in. Duty Guard hits an extension button on a desk phone and offers the receiver... Jesse doesn't move.
C: DUTY GUARD
D: It's a secure line.
N: Duty Guard walks out. Alone now, Jesse picks up the line...
C: JESSE
D: Yeah.
E: into phone
N: A low, whiskey voice is HEARD over the line: LUCIAN ADAMS.
C: LUCIAN V.O.
D: Been a long time...
N: Jesse shuts his eyes. There's a moment before he opens them.
C: LUCIAN V.O.
D: Read about the arrest, Jesse. There's a lot of heat on this one.
C: JESSE
D: I don't want my brother touched.
C: LUCIAN V.O.
D: I ain't callin' about your brother. I'm callin' about you...
E: laughs faintly
N: Jesse turns SLOW to find the Duty Guard watching him from the hall. Lights a cigarette, stares.
C: LUCIAN V.O.
D: You should have come to me sooner, Jesse. None of this would have happened.
C: JESSE
D: I'm askin' you, Lucian. My brother ain't a problem.
C: LUCIAN V.O.
D: Your brother's a fuck up.
N: And Jesse's quiet... Dead quiet...
C: LUCIAN V.O.
D: And Jesse... We may know what you can do. But you know what we can do. Understand?
N: Jesse hesitates, then Lucian hangs up. DIAL TONE.
S: INT. BRADDOCK'S OFFICE - LATE NIGHT
N: Room strewn with piles of casework. Bud, agitated, paces. Braddock, behind a desk.
C: BRADDOCK
D: You're reachin', Bud. The leverage ain't there.
C: BUD
D: It's there. It's gotta cook a little longer, that's all.
C: BRADDOCK
D: Jesse won't so much as blink at doin' life. The fuckin' guy didn't rise in the ranks 'cause he skirts under pressure. There's no deal to be had.
E: beat
C: BUD
D: C'mon, Mike, you know what's goin' on. Ray Wheeler compromised Jesse. By that, he compromised the Brotherhood. Don't tell me there ain't no fuckin' leverage.
N: Bud pours himself a cup of coffee.
C: BRADDOCK
D: We need somethin' more.
C: BUD
D: Well we ain't sleepin' till we find it.
S: INT. VISITOR'S GATE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY
N: Lynn, dark pouches under her eyes, goes through security check. INFANT SON in her arms. VISITING AREA Wives, girlfriends and lawyers talk to prisoners. TABLE Lynn, dark pouches under her eyes, holding their son, across from Jesse...
C: LYNN
D: Life. You know how fuckin' long that is, Jesse?
N: Lynn's hands are shaking.
C: LYNN
D: So what am I supposed to do? Wait? Run? Your friends are comin' by the house. Askin' questions, hangin' around. Waitin' for the God damn phone to ring.
E: upset
N: Jesse is silent.
C: LYNN
D: You said we were done with this. That they were out of our lives.
N: The baby begins to CRY.
C: LYNN
D: We have no money, Jesse. Which means we have no fucking food. ...Say something, would you?
C: JESSE
D: It's gonna be okay.
C: LYNN
D: I'm afraid. I'm afraid for my life...
N: The baby WAILING now.
C: LYNN
D: ...For our baby.
E: quietly crying
N: TIGHT ON JESSE, for the first time, appearing powerless. As Lynn wipes tears, trembling in her seat, Jesse looks away from his son, and glances up... Behind a glass partition outlying the room, a MAN is watching them... BUD. Stark still. Fixing Jesse with a hard stare.
S: INT. PROPERTY ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - LATER
N: A CLERK passes Lynn her belongings through chain link. She wipes her eyes, holding the baby. The back bay doors open. Bud enters. Sleepless, wrinkled clothes.
C: BUD
D: Lynn Wheeler. We haven't been properly introduced. I'm Detective Bud Carter.
C: LYNN
D: I know who you are.
C: BUD
D: You have a ride home?
C: LYNN
D: We took the bus.
N: Bud peels a few bills from a fold, puts it on the counter.
C: BUD
D: Take a cab.
N: Bud lays his card atop the bills, looks at Lynn.
C: BUD
D: 'You need anything...anything at all. Be sure to call me.
N: They look at each other. She pulls her baby close. There's an unspoken moment. And Bud walks away... Lynn waits till Bud is out of view. Then takes the money. And the card.
S: INT. CELLBLOCK, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY
N: A Guard buzzes Jesse through. PRISONERS line the tier. Smoking cigarettes. Looking out. Jesse walks past, enters... HIS CELL ...where Ray sleeps in shadow on the bottom bunk. Jesse pulls a Polaroid from his pocket: His infant son. He gazes at the photo for a beat, then brings it to Ray...
C: JESSE
D: Ray...
N: No response. Jesse nudges his brother's shoulder.
C: JESSE
D: Raymond, take a look.
N: Jesse rolls him over. Ray is limp. A filthy SYRINGE imbedded his arm. Jaw slack. Eyes wide and vacant. THE PHOTO FLUTTERS FROM JESSE'S HAND TO THE FLOOR... Jesse lowers, pulling Ray to his arms. He shuts his eyes. Teeth clench. And as Jesse feels the bile rising, his massive frame begins to shake... Then we realize, he's crying...
T: TIME CUT:
S: EXT. LOADING DOCK, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DUSK
N: Pouring rain. Ray's corpse is loaded onto an ambulance.
S: INT. JESSE'S CELL - DUSK
N: Jesse sits in shadow. Alone. And it's still...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: AFTER HOURS Jesse sleeps. Hand under the pillow. When there's a sound... His eyes SNAP OPEN to discover the silhouettes of SIX MEN, rushing into his cell... A LOADED SOCK swings out from Jesse's pillow, slams MAN #1 in the jaw with a CRACK!! On his feet, Jesse whips the sock around and whacks MAN #2's head against the concrete wall. He slumps down unconscious. A BLUNT OBJECT is rammed into Jesse's sternum. Another shot bangs his neck. The sock drops and a PADLOCK clatters out. With a final burst of energy, Jesse turns, SCREAMS and rushes MAN #3. Man #3 slams into the cell bars. CLANG!! Lights out. The remaining three Men attack. A series of blows rain down and Jesse sinks into their grip. HALL LIGHTS BUMP ON: NOW WE SEE, THESE "MEN" ARE GUARDS. More GUARDS pour in, led by Murphy. They yank Jesse from his cell and take him down the tier. Guards toss the cell in a thorough search. Mattress overturns. Shelves crash.
S: INT. TIER
N: PRISONERS move to their bars, SHOUTING and JEERING as Jesse is wrestled down the STAIRS to... THE LOWER TIER Jesse thrashes violently as the Guards slam him through a door into... A TUNNEL between cell blocks. The ROAR of prisoners recedes as Jesse's dragged into darkness getting darker. A DOOR SLAMS OPEN...
S: INT. READY ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON
N: ...THERE'S A FLASH OF LIGHT. We're in a windowless room. And Bud pouring coffee for two...
C: BUD
D: Want a cup of coffee?
N: Jesse is handcuffed to the table. Guards are breathing hard.
C: JESSE
D: MOTHERFUCKER! This how you do things?
C: BUD
D: Yeah... When I want to talk to someone, without giving the impression he's cooperatin'.
N: Jesse pauses, caught by Bud's tactics. The Guards file out and shut the door. Jesse's eyes are fierce and watching Bud's every movement as he hands him a coffee, then takes a seat...
C: BUD
D: You got a problem.
C: JESSE
D: Yeah, what's that?
C: BUD
D: To start with, you're lookin' at two hundred years.
C: JESSE
D: I've done the time. I'll do it again.
C: BUD
D: I know you can do it. But can your family?
N: Jesse's face is tense. Unyielding.
C: BUD
D: Your brother's dead, Jesse. As we're sittin' here now, he's on a slab at St. Gabriel's Morgue. The coroner's callin' it, "suicide". You and I both know that's a load of shit. You do the time-- sure. And you never see your kid. 'Cept in here. You can recruit him. Your wife...plans...everything... Gone. 'Less you talk...to me.
E: beat beat
N: Jesse silent, a dark internal pause. He meets Bud's eyes across the table; then...
C: JESSE
D: Do you hate?
C: BUD
D: What?
N: Jesse's sudden directness has caught Bud off-guard.
C: JESSE
D: Who do you hate the most? Blacks you throw in prison?
C: BUD
D: ...I dislike what they represent in the system. Not as a whole.
N: And Jesse begins to consciously or unconsciously "preach."
C: JESSE
D: And you believe that by overthrowin' Aryan nationalism and integratin' races...polluted creeds, with us...You believe you're solvin' somethin'?
C: BUD
D: I believe we survive by integrating safety. Understanding hate, and how to stop it.
C: JESSE
D: It ain't evil to fight it. It's evil to tolerate it. Maybe you forget that, to justify what you do for a living...
E: leans in
C: BUD
D: Are we still in prison, or we back at the compound, havin' mass?
C: JESSE
D: You don't get it.
C: BUD
D: No, don't dictate to me what put you in here, or question my intentions with your overcooked revolution! 'Fact, I think you wanted out 'fore I even got to you! That's why you distanced yourself. That's why you're out there crackin' safes. Lookin' to live a life that ain't AB.
E: beat
C: JESSE
D: In who I am, there's pressure! I work for you, I won't need a lawyer, I'll need a priest! My outside finance is gone... My wife and son, their heads wind up somewhere their bodies ain't! So tell me, why the fuck should I get involved with you?!
C: BUD
D: How about personal warranty?
C: JESSE
D: Warranty?!
C: BUD
D: Yeah, that's right! You've been a part of the problem so long, you've forgotten what the fuck that is! "Finance..." Your wife came here on a bus to see you. I sent her home in a cab. Is that your outside fuckin' finance?!
E: boaring in
N: Beat. Jesse, taken back.
C: BUD
D: Let me give you a little insight, pal. As to what I know... And what you think you know.
N: Bud flips open a file and shoves a series of grainy B&W SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS in front of Jesse.
C: BUD
D: This is today...
N: Photo #1: Outside Jesse's House. A distressed Lynn and the baby being led into a car by Catfish.
C: BUD
D: Is that your house? That's your wife, right? Who's this guy?
N: Photo #2: Tight-shot of Catfish.
C: BUD
D: Know where he's takin' them? Takin' your family? I got a pretty good fuckin' idea.
E: off Jesse's look
N: Photo #3: An anonymous duplex. Catfish escorting Lynn and the baby inside, past several surly Aryans looking on. Jesse finally averts his eyes...
C: BUD
D: Look at your wife, Jesse. Look at her face. And your son. They look safe to you? I'm all you've got! I'm all your family's got! And the longer you're in here, they're up for grabs.
E: a moment
N: ON JESSE. The wheels turning. Burning. THE CAMERA MOVES IN...
C: BUD
D: So either you let that happen... Or I get the judge to allow bond. This never sees trial. And you work for me.
N: And that's where it hangs... BLACK.
C: JUDGE V.O.
D: Jesse Wheeler. Please rise...
T: FADE IN:
S: INT. COURTROOM, BATON ROUGE - DAY
N: Jesse rises, wearing a suit. JUDGE PONDER, at the bench, presides over this arraignment hearing:
C: JUDGE PONDER
D: You stand accused of forty counts of burglary, twenty nine counts of felony theft, possession of illegal firearms, possession or dealing in unregistered weapons, possession of a controlled substance, manufacture and possession of incendiary devices, and seventeen counts of receiving stolen goods... How do you plead?
N: CUT TO DANIEL KIERSEY, 40s, sharp, confident, expensively dressed. Jesse's attorney, rising:
C: KIERSEY
D: Not guilty, Your Honor.
C: JUDGE PONDER
D: Let's hear the arguments for bail.
N: The DISTRICT ATTORNEY rises from his seat:
C: DISTRICT ATTORNEY
D: Your honor, this man is an habitual felon as well as a flight risk. Our office has overwhelming evidence that Mr. Wheeler is not only guilty, but also a serious threat to the community. The State recommends that bail be denied.
C: KIERSEY
D: Your honor, my client deserves a reasonable bail. He has every intention of appearing and answering to all these false charges. In addition, he is the sole provider for his wife and newborn child, who would suffer undo hardship if this man were incarcerated.
T: CUT TO Judge Ponder:
C: JUDGE PONDER
D: Bond is set at one million.
N: THE GAVEL BANGS DOWN. Kiersey shakes Jesse's hand. Smiles:
C: KIERSEY
D: Congratulations.
N: REVEAL BUD -- seated in back, watching the proceedings.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BEDROOM, JESSE'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN
N: Lynn, asleep in bed...
S: INT. HALLWAY
N: Jesse stands, holding his son, quietly comforting him. When Jesse turns, WE SEE a .45 tucked in his back. AND THE PHONE RINGS...
C: JESSE
D: Yeah...
E: answers
N: STATIC; he listens, then:
C: JESSE
D: Okay.
E: into phone
S: EXT. BACKYARD, JESSE'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN
N: Jesse steps through his fence into deep WOODS, to find a CAR waiting idyll on a dirt road.
S: INT. CAR - PRE DAWN
N: A HEAVY-SET MAN at the wheel. Jesse gets in as the headlights spin on and the car pulls away...
S: EXT. SHIPYARD - PRE DAWN
N: Dark. Eerie and desolate. The car arrives. Jesse steps out and disappears into the shadows of a towering crane. On the jetty, a nondescript MAN stands alone against the calm Mississippi. His back is to us. Jesse approaches, stands quietly beside him.
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: How's your family?
N: We realize now...It's Bud.
C: JESSE
D: Let's get somethin' straight. I ain't here 'cause I'm scared. I done what I did, 'cause certain people crossed the line. They didn't keep their word.
C: BUD
D: Well my word counts.
N: They stand together, facing the liquid horizon...
C: BUD
D: I want a body, Jesse.
C: JESSE
D: How many you want?
N: Bud finally looks at Jesse.
S: EXT. BORROW PITS - DAWN
N: A swamp area used as a mud retrieval source for the levy. Amite River. FOG OBSCURES NEARLY EVERYTHING. Jesse slowly emerges... Then Bud and Metro, on all sides, MAG- LIGHTS, FLAK JACKETS and SHOTGUNS. A DUFFEL BAG of SHOVELS. The sounds of the swamp are terrifying. Herons and bobcats. Boots hitting water. The buzz of a million mosquitos. SUDDENLY A RUSHING SOUND -- An ALLIGATOR shoves off the mire.
C: COBB
D: 'The fuck is that?
N: Cobb's light catches the tail whipping into the swamp.
C: BUD
D: Yard dog. Relax.
C: SHEPARD
D: Where's this motherfucker taking us?
N: Jesse suddenly STOPS. LISTENS. BREATHES. Bud and Metro stare.
C: JESSE
D: Dig here.
E: directly to Bud
N: Metro exchanges looks, ANXIOUS. Bud nods "okay".
T: TIMECUT:
S: EXT. JESSE'S BORROW PIT
N: Metro engulfed in fog. Picks and shovels rise and fall.
C: MARANDINO
D: Bud! We hit something!
N: Bud excitedly descends the pit to scrape gravel from metal.
C: BUD
D: Clear it off! Come on, find the edges!
N: Jesse watches as a pair of STEEL DRUMS emerge.
S: INT. STATE POLICE AUTOPSY ROOM - MID MORNING
N: The "cold room". Bud and Braddock watch as two PATHOLOGISTS hose down the drums. The stench is horrible.
C: BRADDOCK
D: How long they been down there?
C: BUD
D: Jesse tells me six months.
C: BRADDOCK
D: Six months? Bud, they're biodegraded by now. Fuckin' worm food.
C: BUD
D: We'll get an ID. Remember, we got the guy who put 'em there.
N: BLOW TORCHES ROAR as Pathologists burn through the drums. Sparks fly. The lids CRASH. Swamp water floods out... And immersed within: two sore-covered, DECOMPOSING BODIES. The room recoils from the fumes.
S: INT. KITCHEN, JESSE'S HOUSE - DAY
N: Lynn is putting dishes away. The baby nearby, sleeps quietly in a swing. Lynn gazes out the window...
S: EXT. DRIVEWAY, JESSE'S HOUSE
N: Jesse is under the hood of his truck, fixing the engine... When a '71 Mustang, white-on-white, roars up the street. Jesse glances over as the car pulls alongside the driveway. It's CATFISH, at the wheel. A wolfish grin.
C: CATFISH
D: 'Bout time to get a new truck there, Jesse.
N: Jesse tightens a nut with a torque wrench, says nothing.
C: CATFISH
D: Good to see you out. A free man now.
C: JESSE
D: What's goin' on, 'Fish?
C: CATFISH
D: On a Sunday drive, that's all. The good Lord ridin' shotgun, through another glorious Louisiana mornin'.
N: Jesse EYES his .45 atop the engine block, within reach.
C: CATFISH
D: Say, Jesse... Lucian's askin' about you. Fact, a lot of people are.
N: Jesse stays on the engine, never turns around.
C: JESSE
D: You tell him I'll come by.
C: CATFISH
D: That's good. I'll see you real soon then.
E: no longer smiling
N: As Catfish drives away... We HEAR a series of photos being taken at high-speed. FREEZE FRAME to BLACK & WHITE. PULL BACK to a distant CONSTRUCTION TRAILER. Bud with a long lens camera, triggers snapshots.
S: INT. DINER - DAY
N: Greasy spoon, soul food joint. Trucker and labor patrons. Bud walks in, perplexed to find Braddock sitting with MARTIN FITCH (30), Deputy Chief of Staff for US Attorney General. Pressed suit. Young face. Out of his element.
C: BUD
D: Hey, Mike.
C: BRADDOCK
D: Bud, this is Special Agent, Martin Fitch. He's down from Washington. With the Attorney General.
C: FITCH
D: Martin. Just call me Martin.
N: Fitch offers his hand, smiles. Bud shakes.
C: BRADDOCK
D: Martin's gonna be soliciting Jesse's case for a Federal sponsor.
C: BUD
D: How long you been with the Attorney General, Fitch?
C: FITCH
D: Just over a year.
N: Bud looks at Braddock.
C: FITCH
D: I want to assure you my education and experience is more than adequate to handle a case of this potential.
C: BUD
D: Is that right...
N: Fitch's smile drops as Bud stares him down.
C: BRADDOCK
D: Why don't we get to the particulars?
C: FITCH
D: Right. Alright. To get Jesse a federal sponsor, we need something substantial. A bait. In the Justice Department, we have this mission statement... We decide who the target is, what's the threat assessment, the cost value, over what time table it's gonna take place... Which target do we go after first. We don't want to miss a big target hitting a smaller target, you understand?
E: clears throat
C: BUD
D: No.
C: FITCH
D: Well, exposing bodies has limitations. Those people are dead. We can't retrieve their lives.
N: Bud blinks.
C: BRADDOCK
D: He means there might not be enough to back Jesse.
C: BUD
D: Keep him on the street without protection, he winds up dead.
C: FITCH
D: What I'm saying is, we need fresh leads. He'll need to present something that separates him from those we're going to arrest. If Jesse can't offer something continuous... I'm afraid we can't be of much help.
N: Bud stares at Fitch. A WAITRESS in her 50s approaches.
C: WAITRESS
D: Ready to order?
C: FITCH
D: Yes. I'll take a garden salad. Roquefort on the side.
E: cuts in
C: WAITRESS
D: You'll take what?
C: FITCH
D: It's a dressing.
E: curt
C: WAITRESS
D: Well...we got ranch, thousand island and oil. Which one you want?
N: Bud's chair SCRAPES back as he stands, stares hard at Fitch:
C: BUD
D: Lost my appetite.
N: And walks out.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE DINER - DAY
N: Bud stalks out to his car. Braddock follows, agitated. They say nothing till they reach the car.
C: BUD
D: I set this up. Me and Jesse. If the Feds want to help, that's fine. But not him.
C: BRADDOCK
D: What do you mean, "me and Jesse?" He's not your partner, Bud. This case is beyond our capacity. It requires resources we don't have.
N: Bud unlocks the car. They stand, talking across the roof.
C: BUD
D: They ain't takin' us serious, Mike. They send us some kid with a year under his belt?! He don't even know what state he's in... You want him in charge?!
C: BRADDOCK
D: You're God damn right I do! You're out on a limb on this already, Bud! It's my job to make sure you get back!
C: BUD
D: This is bullshit.
C: BRADDOCK
D: That may be. What it ain't, is open for discussion.
N: Braddock walks away. Bud simmers a moment, gets in his car.
S: INT. A ROOM - FOLLOWING MORNING
N: A bare room; nothing to tell us where we are. Jesse's on a stool. He runs his fingers down his mustache, grits his teeth.
C: JESSE
D: Y'all wanna talk about crime? Well I could tell y'all things. Names. Locations. What boat is movin' what drugs, which one is guns. Who's gonna get cut up and why. ...But what I got to know is, if 'n when I do this... If I wear your dog collar... Y'all gonna do what's right by me and keep my head from gettin' shot the fuck off? 'Cause the truth is, you need me. You ain't got enough cops with enough sense or enough time, to clear them crimes that already been committed and will be. Y'all need me... I got the devil's address.
E: pause
N: REVERSE: We're in a HOTEL SUITE. Shades down. Full of AGENTS: FBI, ATF, DEA, SECRET SERVICE. Law enforcement everywhere. On the furniture, against the wall, sitting on the floor. Staring at Jesse in silence. Bud stands by the door with Braddock. And Fitch steps forward, laughs nervously...
C: FITCH
D: Okay, great... Thanks. Thank you, Jesse, for that. And thank you, everyone for attending... Uh, we all know why we're here. To solve a matter of custody--
E: tight
N: FBI #1 We'll protect you and your family, Jesse. (to the room) It's a federal matter, gentlemen. Those bodies were transported over state lines. An ATF AGENT #1 imposes: ATF #1 Not so fast. Ammunition, grenades? This man's house was a factory, for Christ's sake. ATF is taking this.
C: DEA
D: Those murders were drug related. DEA's got to do follow ups.
C: SECRET SERVICE
D: He was printing counterfeit money. That's Secret Service.
N: ARGUING ENSUES, Agents' voices step over one another. Fitch tries to take control. Jesse's been silent, until...
C: JESSE
D: There's a hit list.
N: Fitch hears this. He turns, loudly to the room...
C: FITCH
D: Wait! Wait a minute, quiet! Everyone quiet!
N: And EVERYTHING stops. Fitch moves to Jesse:
C: FITCH
D: A what?
C: JESSE
D: A hit list. There's much as twelve. Might be one or two less now, I ain't sure. Some could've already been gotten.
C: BUD
D: Now we're talkin'.
E: to Braddock
N: FBI #2 approaches Jesse... FBI #2 Why these twelve, Jesse?
C: JESSE
D: Different reasons. It ain't so much why or what they done that matters. Pick any one of 'em off that list, AB puts you on salary.
N: Everyone is suddenly interested. Bud sees this.
C: JESSE
D: And you, sir, if I ain't mistaken... You're Mr. Nokes, right?
N: Agents part, revealing JOHN NOKES(50s), black, an emminent figurehead in a plush suit. Surprised to be pointed out...
C: JESSE
D: First U.S. Attorney, John Nokes?
C: NOKES
D: That's right.
C: JESSE
D: Well, last time I seen it...you was number two on that list.
N: It's quiet. Nokes thinks. Then LAUGHS and approaches Jesse.
C: NOKES
D: Can you fill us in on the rest of those names, Jesse?
C: JESSE
D: Yes, I can. But there's something I gotta make clear 'fore that happens.
C: NOKES
D: What's that?
C: JESSE
D: I've listened to you, Mr. Nokes. And I've listened to these suits here, on who's gonna take me in... I will die, go to hell and take all y'all cocksuckers with me, if he-- --tells me to. I want y'all to know that.
E: beat motions to Bud beat
N: Jesse is explosive under the low projection delivery and a CHILL falls over the room.
C: NOKES
D: How's that fly by you, Lieutenant?
E: to Bud
N: Bud simply nods.
C: NOKES
D: I'll sponsor him. Jesse's welfare will come out of our budget. Anyone has pending cases or leads for Jesse, see me. I'll loan him out.
N: Jesse stares at Nokes. As the meeting settles back to a comfortable level...
C: NOKES
D: And, Jesse... I'm a little pissed I'm number two on that list. Who the fuck is number one?
N: The room erupts with LAUGHTER. Everyone except Bud and Jesse.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. GRAND COUTEAU - DAY
N: Jesse's truck moves over an old wooden bridge through sweeping fields that stretch to a vast, wooded area.
S: EXT. FRONT GATES, PRIVATE PROPERTY - DAY
N: Jesse stops at a long drive protected by locked iron gates. A surveillance camera zooms in. Jesse looks up. A second camera pans on Jesse, staring... MOVE IN as crackling, electronic pixels FILL THE FRAME and...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. GUARD STATION - SAME
N: A BANK OF MONITORS showing Jesse at the gates. A GUARD sits in shadow, hits a button: We see the gates unlock and open.
S: INT. JESSE'S TRUCK
N: pulls down the private road. Shafts of light mottle then burst, REVEALING an elegant VICTORIAN HOME. Jesse parks -- walks up the porch, where Catfish is relaxing, shoulder holster, revolver. And Buzz, cleaning a pistol.
C: BUZZ
D: Jesse.
N: Jesse nods, eyes Catfish.
C: JESSE
D: I'm here to see Lucian.
N: Catfish grinds out his cigarette, gets to his feet.
C: CATFISH
D: He's busy right now; You can come in and wait.
S: INT. LUCIAN ADAMS' OFFICE - DAY
N: CLOSE ON: A SNIFTER as Louis XIII pours to the rim. From elsewhere in the room:
C: MALE VOICE
D: This operation of your's has become big business. You need relationships now more than ever...
N: THE VOICE belongs to RICHARD MORRIS, 40s. He sits in a leather chair, facing Lucian Adams, who's face we cannot see. Seated next to Morris, is Daniel Kiersey.
C: MORRIS
D: ...We've done business successfully before, Mr. Adams. But it's a larger scope now. I'm here today because I want to represent you exclusively. You need someone lobbying at a state level, as well as in Washington. My organization can provide both. We've got contacts that you don't have and other people can't get. Now, I'm aware that you have multiple businesses... However you need one go-to guy, so that all your ventures stay coordinated and all transactions and contracts are realized. I am that person, Mr. Adams. That's what I do.
N: LUCIAN'S HAND lifts the cognac out of frame, drinks.
C: KIERSEY
D: What's this going to cost us?
C: MORRIS
D: As a retainer, I want an advance of three hundred-fifty thousand, along with ten percent of whatever economic benefit I bring to this organization.
C: KIERSEY
D: Three-fifty? C'mon, Dick. That's out of line.
C: MORRIS
D: If you want a quality global economic plan, that's what you pay for--
C: LUCIAN O.S.
D: We'll give you two, Mr. Morris...That's what it's worth.
N: Morris goes suddenly silent, looks across at Lucian.
C: LUCIAN O.S.
D: The advance is a drop in the bucket. The real money is the percentage. It's in your interest to see it my way.
N: Morris stares across the desk, several tense moments. Then:
C: MORRIS
D: You've got a deal.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM, LUCIAN ADAMS' HOUSE - DAY
N: Morris emerges from the office. He glances at Jesse, then shrugs on his coat and leaves... Jesse looks back at the office doorway. FOLLOW Jesse in...
S: INT. LUCIAN ADAM'S OFFICE
N: ...past Kiersey, behind a massive desk in this impeccable room, we finally SEE LUCIAN ADAMS. Jesse is not invited to sit.
C: LUCIAN
D: Give us a minute.
E: to Kiersey
N: Kiersey walks out and shuts the door... ON LUCIAN he crosses slowly to a credenza, selects a clean shirt.
C: LUCIAN
D: You have a son now, right?
C: JESSE
D: Yeah...
N: As he removes the shirt he's wearing, REVEAL tattoos: BLACK SUN on his back. GERMAN RUNES, SS BOLTS, HRUNGNIR'S HEART. And around his stomach, a belt of NORSE GODS with the words, "INVISIBLE EMPIRE." Prison tats, dark and aged.
C: LUCIAN
D: What'd you name him?
C: JESSE
D: I named him Ray.
N: Lucian, no emotion, puts on a pressed dress shirt, fastens cuff-links.
C: LUCIAN
D: Heard the cops smacked you around inside.
E: over his shoulder
C: JESSE
D: 'Wasn't too bad.
N: Lucian checks his hair.
C: LUCIAN
D: You've been a busy man, Jesse. More ways than one.
C: JESSE
D: Looks like you done just fine without me. Business rollin' through the door.
N: And Lucian finally turns; looks at Jesse, eyes measuring...
C: LUCIAN
D: Last I saw you, you asked for time. Time to raise a family. Time to straighten things out. I gave you that time... Then safe jobs start poppin' up. Lafayette. New Orleans. Clinton. Baton Rouge. All over. The boys, they think it's niggers, gone widespread on a hunt for pig's feet. But they all professional. Burn jobs. Hot-weld oxygen. Laid out, burned, laid back, perfect. I knew right then and there, only a white respectable burglar could've done this.
E: pause locked on Jesse
N: Jesse smiles slightly. They know each other well... ...When Lucian's smile suddenly drops. There's a flash of controlled anger across his face; and WE FEEL a curtain of tension fall heavily on the room.
C: LUCIAN
D: Jesse... With all the work you been doin': Diamonds. Emeralds. A dozen safe jobs, behind my back... Where's the tribute to the greater cause?
E: predatory
N: Jesse he pulls from his pocket, a tiny pouch. Sets it on the desk... He pours the contents into Lucian's palm: DIAMONDS and EMERALDS.
C: JESSE
D: Like I said, I just needed time.
N: Lucian approaches the desk, opens the pouch: DIAMONDS and EMERALDS... A slow smile spreads across his face.
C: LUCIAN
D: Well, even prophets stumble once in a while.
N: Lucian embraces Jesse. Tight. Then, softly in his ear:
C: LUCIAN
D: It's a shame about your brother.
N: As they part, their eyes meet. Something passes between them... I/E. JESSE'S TRUCK, TRAVELING - BACK ROAD - NIGHT Jesse at the wheel, glances nervously in the rearview. Lynn in the passenger seat, baby in her lap. They're driving under the cover of darkness...
C: LYNN
D: I don't understand. Why do we have to leave the state? You're not tellin' me something. You're not tellin' me a lot.
C: JESSE
D: It ain't safe here no more. You wanted out? This is out.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PRIVATE AIRSTRIP - NIGHT
N: Marandino looks through BINOCULARS: As an electric fence slides back. Jesse's truck approaches, drives through.
S: EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT
N: A twin-engine PLANE idylls. Lines of blue lights, strobe like rivers, air traffic above... And Bud, leaning against a nearby car with Shepard and Cobb. Jesse helps Lynn and the baby from his truck. Together, they walk toward the plane... Bud, watching from a distance, nods to Lynn. OUTSIDE THE PLANE Jesse and Lynn stare at each other. She's crying as he pulls her close, one arm around the baby. He says something to them we cannot hear... Then with the baby, Lynn boards her plane. An AGENT shuts the door. The engine SCREAMS to life, taking off... Jesse turns to shield his face. Lights STROBE and BLAST... Then, ABRUPT DARKNESS AND SILENCE... ON JESSE now alone on the tarmac. Bud approaches; then...
C: JESSE
D: Lucian took the stones. Talked about jobs. High-end, boxcar.
C: BUD

S: INT. METRO OFFICE - NIGHT
N: An organizational chart, as Bud pins AB mug shots, arrest sheets and surveillance photos wall to wall. Bud steps back, observes. His case building. Getting huge. MONTAGE OUT/TO:
S: EXT. BACK PATIO, LUCIAN'S HOUSE - DAY
N: Wood secluded. Lucian, Jesse and Kiersey sit around a table.
C: KIERSEY
D: There's a variety of matters to discuss today, gentlemen. Eddie Moran's trial starts next week. One of the jurors reached out. He's asking six thousand up front plus a job at four hundred a week. That guarantees a hung jury with a push for an acquittal.
C: LUCIAN
D: Three hundred. Give him a no-show at the trucking firm.
C: KIERSEY
D: Construction on the building Morris brought us, in south-east Florida, is complete. Every unit sold. We should see revenues of one point four million over our original projections.
E: as he writes
N: Lucian lights a cigar, smoke curls from his lips.
C: KIERSEY
D: Lastly, our "friends" from the Middle East. They put a final offer on the table. They'll fund our operation in Louisiana if we agree to act on their behalf. Political targets mostly, on the basis of our approval... I advise we do a test case. Perhaps a sample of their resources.
E: beat
C: LUCIAN
D: "Final offer?" Demands... Close the deal. We'll cook the cash for it. By the time they realize, we'll have our return. You believe they're travelin' all the way to Louisiana just to get fuckin' robbed?

C: JESSE
D: I'll be honest, I was hopin' for somethin' bigger.
C: LUCIAN
D: What do you got in mind?
C: JESSE
D: How 'bout a few of them heads off the list?
C: LUCIAN
D: We got guys for that now. Catfish, Buzz. What do you want to go back to that for?
C: JESSE
D: The money's worth twice this. Bring back a head it's fifteen grand; Bring a heart, it's thirty, right?
N: Lucian looks at Jesse, who feels Lucian's scrutiny.
C: LUCIAN
D: Tell you what. Do this other thing we got lined up... Then I'll give you that taste.

S: INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
N: HEADQUARTERS for the Baton Rouge operation. A beehive of government activity. TECHNICIANS listen to tapes... PHONES ring off the hook... Bud and Fitch going over the case:
C: FITCH
D: There's pressure from Washington. They send compliments for Jesse's work. But our primary concern is that list. I need names we can protect.
C: BUD
D: We know that, Fitch. He's workin' on it.
C: FITCH
D: If Jesse can just get a direct order... from Lucian to him, on a wire--
C: BUD
D: --A wire?! He just went back to work, you want him to wear a fuckin' wire? Put a tap on that God damn lawyer's phone, that's what you should do.
E: beat
C: FITCH
D: He's an attorney, Carter. Anything we get would be inadmissable.
C: BUD
D: It's information, Fitch.
N: Fitch, annoyed, but staying on track.
C: FITCH
D: Bud. We need Jesse to engage Lucian on the record. Otherwise it's just hearsay. He's disconnected from everything, like a ghost.
N: Bud, cooling his heels. As the phones RING and RING...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: A violent rainfall. AERIAL SHOT swooping along the HIGHWAY, then rising above the deep woods to reveal a TRUCK STOP ahead.
S: EXT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT
N: Closed for construction. A VAN arrives. A blinking barricade is pulled back, allowing entrance... Generators light the scene: A group of SHIITE MUSLIMS wait by a pair of idle FREIGHT TRUCKS. A crew of five AB SOLDIERS exit the van: Jesse, Catfish and Buzz among them.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. LUMBER STORAGE, TRUCK STOP - NIGHT
N: The door to one Freight truck rolls to the top, revealing a converted ASSAULT WEAPONRY SHOWCASE. Below covered scaffolding, both crews stand. Guns bulge through their coats. No talking. No sudden movement. Shiites watch Jesse and Catfish examine the merchandise: SEMI AUTOMATICS, SHOTGUNS, CARBINES, SUB-MACHINE GUNS... Everyone looks at each other. Jesse acknowledges worth. Catfish pulls a large CANVAS BAG from the van, filled with cash. As he carries it toward a bench, a large Shiite (OMAR) reaches for the bag before Catfish can set it down... ...Both men hold tight. Neither letting go. And there's a moment.
C: JESSE
D: Catfish.
E: low
N: Catfish and Omar are eye-to-eye. Then, Catfish lets go with a smile:
C: CATFISH
D: Go 'head. Count it.
N: The Shiite leader, NASEEM, sees the strife.
C: NASEEM
D: There a problem?
C: JESSE
D: No problem. Money's all there.
N: Omar hands the bag to Naseem. The count starts. Both crews watch closely... ...All except Catfish, fixated on Omar, who stares back.
C: CATFISH
D: 'The fuck you lookin' at...?
N: The count stops. Naseem looks to Omar. Questions in Arabic go back and forth. The pressure getting to the group...
C: JESSE
D: Catfish, would you shut the fuck up? This ain't the time.
E: low
C: NASEEM
D: Yes, listen to your boss.
E: to Catfish
C: CATFISH
D: What?! What fuckin' "boss?" You best watch your ass, sand nigger.
C: NASEEM
D: Piece of shit--!
N: Everyone reaches for their guns. Threats SHOUTED in Arabic and English.
C: JESSE
D: Take it easy! Take it easy!
N: SUDDENLY ARC LIGHTS BEHIND A DISTANT BARRIER IGNITE, flooding the scene. Everyone turns.
C: A VOICE
D: ATF! THE PERIMETER'S SURROUNDED!
E: over a loud speaker
N: Omar reaches for the bag of cash... BLAM! Catfish FIRES, point blank, shooting Omar in the face. And World War III erupts. AB's FIRE. Shiites RETURN FIRE. From several stakeout locations, ATF AGENTS deploy and OPEN FIRE. Jesse is grazed in the shoulder, slips, staggers-runs. SHIITE #1 FIRES THREE SHOT BURSTS at AB #1, who's blown apart. A generator and ATF #1 collapse. ATF #2 and #3 with pump shotguns OPEN UP on the AB's van. Naseem, over a Mercedes roof, FIRES A BURST at ATF, then swings onto AB #2 and FIRES, killing him. Naseem jumps into the Mercedes, yells at the DRIVER to go. Buzz RAPID FIRES, hits Shiite #1 in the back. Shiite #1 is spun around and Buzz shoots him in the head. Catfish FIRES into the lot... Hitting SHIITE #2. IN THE MERCEDES, Driver floors it. ATF re-emerges, kneels and PUMPS SHOTS into the Mercedes. Jesse has taken off, past the lumber storage. Catfish and Buzz follow, breaking for the Freight truck. IN THE MERCEDES, Driver is blown apart by ATF. The car CRASHES into a dumpster, knocking Naseem out. Jesse, Catfish and Buzz jump into the Freight. ATF FIRES. WINDOWS EXPLODE. SHIITE #3, trying to climb in is shot down. Jesse, behind the wheel... BURNS rubber pulling out of the stop, over and through a scaffold, collapsing it. The Freight truck draws everyone's FIRE. Jesse pilots it through the CHAOS. Scaffold DRAGGING behind. Sparks fly. JESSE'S POV: Where he's going. An opening in the construction, leads back to the HIGHWAY and ONCOMING TRAFFIC. ATF CARS speeds in, the opposite way... AS THE VEHICLES PASS: JESSE AND ATF lock eyes. And the Freight makes the highway, scattering traffic, to the sound of ongoing GUNFIRE...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DESOLATE FIELD - LATE NIGHT
N: The moon hangs low as Jesse parks the Freight truck among tall grass, where a vacant BREAD TRUCK is waiting.

C: JESSE
D: You're a piece of work, Catfish.
N: Buzz grabs at Jesse; Jesse HURLS him to the ground.
C: CATFISH
D: Them niggers crossed the line...I had to burn 'em--

D: --You had to keep your mouth shut! On a job, you don't do fuckin' shit 'less I say!
C: CATFISH

N: Jesse slams him back again. HOLDS his throat.
C: JESSE
D: Fuck me up again, you hear me? I'll leave you where I find you. Got that?
E: low, deadly
N: PAUSE. Catfish glares, then concedes.
C: JESSE
D: Unload the fuckin' truck.
N: Jesse starts moving crates from the Freight onto the bread truck. Catfish and Buzz watch for a moment, then join.
S: INT. FBI WAREHOUSE - LATE NIGHT
N: Televisions broadcast news coverage of the shoot-out. AGENTS work, uncomfortable, as Bud and Fitch argue. Explosive...
C: FITCH
D: Keep your voice down! This was out of my control!
C: BUD
D: I'm telling you, your agents best pull their shit together! Who the hell y'all trying to protect?!
C: FITCH
D: Look, Carter. This is a joint task force with multiple agendas, that run up the chain of command through me. Intel came forth at the eleventh hour that Naseem Kazuri - an international arms dealer - would be present at this meet. ATF was tasked to observe and report.
C: BUD
D: That ain't what they did--!
C: FITCH
D: --No! Because your informant--
C: BUD
D: My informant, that's right!--
C: FITCH
D: --Your informant and his psychopath crew greased half our political interests -- over a bag of fake cash! You weren't informed, so what?
C: BUD
D: Well I better be informed! 'Cause this ain't fallin' short! Now, any of y'all got a collaborative agenda in the works? I want to see it. These other agencies, what time-lines they lookin' at? What deadlines and why?
C: FITCH
D: Above your pay-grade--
C: BUD
D: And is there a purposeful lack of communication between competing agencies, who are right now charting future mistakes, as we fuckin' speak?!
E: overlapping
C: FITCH
D: That's not your concern, Carter!
N: Braddock suddenly arrives, steps into the room...
C: BUD
D: We're not talkin' about me!!
C: BRADDOCK
D: Bud!
C: BUD
D: What?!
E: spins
C: BRADDOCK
D: You're over-involved here.
N: And Bud's taken off stride. Braddock looks Bud right in the eyes, so there's no doubt...
C: BRADDOCK
D: I'll handle this.
N: Bud, red with anger, walks out. Braddock watches him go. Fitch comes over, relieved...
C: FITCH
D: Thanks for coming down, Mike. He's been berating my agents for the last hour.
N: Braddock pours a cup of coffee.
C: FITCH
D: We're trying to band-aid a situation here, and frankly, Carter's preference for thug tactics isn't helping. It'll all be in my report...
C: BRADDOCK
D: "Isn't helping?"
E: interrupts
N: A big mistake. Now Braddock turns on Fitch, zeroing in...
C: BRADDOCK
D: "Isn't helping?" Let's not miss what happened here, Fitch. We work for the same cause doesn't mean we work for you. What are you gonna do now? Send Jesse back out? Earn his trust? Bud Carter delivered the biggest informant in the history of this state to your lap, and you and the people you work for are gonna let it go to shit. You can expect that will be in my report.

S: INT. STEEL MILL OFFICE - PRE DAWN
N: Lucian shuts the door and sits before an ill at ease Morris.
C: MORRIS
D: Look. I had no previous knowledge of any business with Muslims. So if stealing me here in the middle of the night, is some kind of accusation--
C: LUCIAN
D: I'm not accusing you, Mr. Morris. But I do find it interesting that right about the time I employ you, my operation starts having problems.
C: MORRIS
D: Yes, but--
C: LUCIAN
D: That is interesting...isn't it?
N: Morris swallows hard as Lucian stares intensely.
C: LUCIAN
D: I want to know if this was an isolated incident. If the ATF impeding on my work is the result of a deeper threat.
C: MORRIS
D: What are you suggesting?
C: LUCIAN
D: I'm suggesting you contact your friends in Washington.
C: MORRIS
D: With all due respect, Mr. Adams, that's not what I was retained for.
C: LUCIAN
D: Well now it is.
C: MORRIS
D: That sort of information requires clearance I don't have. If I start sniffing around, people are going to ask questions.
C: LUCIAN
D: I'm asking questions, Mr. Morris. And I'm getting impatient.
N: Morris gets stone quiet. Lucian hands him a phone.

C: LYNN V.O.
D: Jesse?
N: He hangs up. A LONG MOMENT... Jesse stands there, watching the car... He slowly makes his way toward the back of the store, where his truck is parked. Pulse pounding, he tries the door...it's locked. Eyeing the car, he unlocks his truck. THERE'S SUDDEN MOVEMENT. Jesse spins. And out of the darkness -- steps Bud -- ready to pounce...
C: BUD
D: Where the hell you been? Two days missin', you broke protocol. Three, and you're a flight risk. Agents'll hunt your ass down.
E: Jesse's look

D: So you're implying I should thank him?
N: Bud shakes his head in disgust, keeps walking...
C: FITCH
D: Look, Carter, whether we like it or not, you and I have to work together on this. We entice Jesse back. I'll get him full protection, if he agrees to testify.
C: BUD
D: That'll never happen.
C: FITCH
D: Why the hell not?!
C: BUD
D: 'Cause it's over, Fitch. It's done. He has nothing. Why do you think he lit that fire? To plant a flag. To let us know he doesn't need our protection. Doesn't want it. He would've just left 'em for dead.
E: turns
C: FITCH
D: For God sakes, listen to me! I'm not taking the fall for this! The plan is--
C: BUD
D: No, the truth is, Fitch, you ain't got balls big enough to relate to this guy. If you had listened to me, we wouldn't be in this situation. Jesse wouldn't be in this situation. And you wouldn't be askin' stupid fuckin' questions! I'll bring him in myself. Just keep your agents off my ass.

D: What do you want to know? Want to hear about your brother? How we had him shot up with strychnine? How he died slow death?
N: Without warning, Jesse grabs the PLIERS. A flash of movement, and there's a TERRIBLE SCREAM AS CATFISH'S FRONT TOOTH IS RIPPED OUT. He bucks violently in his chair. Jesse jams the DRILL into Catfish's gums, high speed. BLOOD SPRAYS. Loud, electric pain and Catfish CRIES OUT IN TERROR. Jesse sets down the drill, deadpan.

C: JESSE
D: Where's he hidin' out?
N: Catfish, last ounce of spite, cracks a blackened grin:
C: CATFISH
D: Get fucked.
N: THE DRILL STRIKES. Bone deep. Gum line splays open. Teeth crack and split. Catfish SCREAMS UNCONTROLLABLY. Blacks out. Jesse stops. A brief reprieve. He gets up and looks around the apartment. SEES: Magazines. A few revolvers. Empty liquor bottles. Meth on the counter. And on the stove: A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE. Beside a pie tin, speed base boiling. Jesse stares. He lowers the syringe into the tin, plunger up, drawing fluid... ...then very deliberately sticks Catfish's arm with the tip of the needle, pops a cc. Catfish bolts awake, EYES WIDE. A long, wet WHEEZE.
C: JESSE
D: Where's Lucian?
N: Catfish's head lulls. Jesse grabs him by the hair. Leans in.
C: JESSE
D: Where's Lucian?

C: JESSE
D: I believe you.
E: softly
N: With that, Jesse pushes the plunger down...ever...so...slowly. Blood burps and bubbles from Catfish's throat. Lungs convulse and spasm. Eye go wide then roll back. A suicide dose.

S: INT. PAYROLL OFFICE
N: ...And Mills FIRES a gun, burning Jesse's ear -- Blood pours down his neck -- and Jesse's Tactical FIRES. Mills is HIT IN THE THROAT. He falls into a chair. And his eyes - at the fierce face of death - are filled with Jesse, who FIRES TWO ROUNDS. One to the head. That fast.
S: INT. BACK ROOM

N: Doorman #1, HEARING the commotion turns... ...SEES INSIDE THE CAFE, Cobb cuffing Jacket and Barkeep. Doorman #1 draws a Para-Ordnance .45, FIRES. A VOLLEY OF SHOTS SLAM INTO THE CAFE. Cobb can't make it through INCOMING FIRE and covers. Remaining PATRONS SCREAM, drop under tables. Doorman #1 KEEPS FIRING, advancing towards the Cafe, when-- BOOM! A SHOTGUN BLAST takes his head off -- REVEALING BUD -- behind him, running toward Tibedaux's. I/E. TIBEDAUX'S, DOWNSTAIRS PATRONS stampede for the door. Lucian, Bingham and Kay with AB #7 and #8 follow... OUTSIDE TO THE STREET ...and Bud is coming right for them. CLOSE ON LUCIAN. The shock of seeing Bud. Lucian FIRES. Bud kneels and PUMPS SHOTS - hits AB #7 and #8 - killing them. Lucian, Kay, Bingham flee back inside.
S: INT. TIBEDAUX'S, MAINTENANCE ROOM

N: MOVING WITH BUD entering, KICKING down doors, sweeping rooms with his shotgun... No sign of Lucian.
S: INT. DOWNSTAIRS, BACK ROOMS
N: Jesse is coming... ...and the SLAUGHTER BUILDS. He throws open a door to a BAR AREA. AB #10 and #11 FIRE SMGs WILDLY, running from the room. Jesse UNLOADS the sawed-off. MISSING. Plaster throws and crumbles. A GUNSHOT rips through Jesse's left arm. The sawed-off drops to his side. Jesse turns - EDGAR BINGHAM is FIRING a SERVICE REVOLVER - SHOTS MISS as Jesse dives behind the bar. HAROLD KAY is moving down the stairwell. FIRING an Automatic wildly. Bottles and glasses explode. Bingham keeps firing. Mirrors SHATTER. BEHIND THE BAR bullets splinter wood, Jesse slams another magazine into the .45. Above him, strays catch lights, glass filaments EXPLODE.
S: INT. UPSTAIRS, HALLWAYS + ROOMS
N: Bud KICKS down a door. AB #12 charges out. Grabs for Bud... who breaks the grab, pulls AB #12's neck down, slams his knee into his forehead twice, knocked cold. Grabs his gun. A HALLWAY DOOR SWINGS OPEN AB #13 emerges, HAMMERING GUNSHOTS. Bud covers. SHOTS BLOW HOLES in the wall. A SECOND DOOR OPENS ...and AB #14 steps out, draws. Bud throws him in the way of CROSS-FIRE. AB #13 takes AB #14's SHOTS. Bud aims past. FIRES ONCE. AB #14 is hit dead center and drops like an oak. Both men dead. That fast, and Bud is on the move...

N: AB #10 and #11 run out and swing their SMGs, FIRING onto the alley and KILLING MARANDINO... Then charging to the front-- COBB FIRES. AB #10 is BLOWN APART, as AB #11 FIRES back, hitting Cobb in the vest. His ribs broken, he sits down stunned.
C: COBB
D: I'm hit. I'm fuckin' hit.
E: into radio
N: AB #11 running past as several BLACK AND WHITES now arrive. TAKE AND RETURN FIRE -- AB #11 is shot dead. Police shouting. Civilians running, as...
S: INT. BACK BAR AREA, DOWNSTAIRS
N: GUNFIGHT ENSUES. Jesse rises over the bar, FIRING BURSTS into Kay, who tumbles down the stairwell like a rag doll. Bingham shoots Jesse in the hip. He staggers, then falls and rolls to his back... Bingham rounds the bar just as Jesse, somehow, lifts the .45 and FIRES two slugs into Bingham's chest. Bingham collapses on top of Jesse. The .45 hits the floor. Both men, bleeding profusely, thrash along the floor...
S: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
N: Bud, racing toward a stairwell, LEAPS down a flight, turns, and RUNS down another.
S: INT. BACK BAR AREA
N: Jesse, trapped under the heavy Bingham, pulls the buck knife from his holster and sinks it into Bingham's kidney. TWISTS. Blood POOLS. Bingham MOANS... ...Jesse rolls the big man over, hoists himself high and impales Bingham through the throat. Dead. Jesse exhales, struggles up...rising to his feet... BLAM! - A SUDDEN GUNSHOT out of nowhere. JESSE COLLAPSES, A BUNDLE OF TWITCHING NERVES, BLOOD POOLING FAST OUT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD... ...AND LUCIAN STANDS OVER HIM, HIS .357 SMOKING. Lucian turns slow. Toward a cracked MIRROR. Suddenly... IN THE REFLECTION: BUD EXPLODES DOWN THE STAIRS, AND SLAMS INTO LUCIAN WITH THE IMPACT OF A TRUCK. BOTH HIT THE FLOOR. Lucian points his gun at Bud's head, who reaches for the trigger guard, shifts the barrel an inch -- A ROUND GOES OFF, BLOWING THROUGH BUD'S SHOULDER -- HE YELLS OUT, HOOKS HIS
S: FINGER IN THE TRIGGER, STOPPING THE NEXT SHOT.
N: Bud flips Lucian over, rips the gun away. Lucian tries to break free. Bud grabs him - smashes the gun over and over against Lucian's face. Lucian's head BOUNCES. Eyes roll, then right. Lucian quarter rolls, then CRACKS a forearm into Bud's head. Again, and Bud is knocked back with a gash over his eye. Lucian REARS BACK and KICKS HARD into Bud's sternum. Lucian scrambles. Bud tackles him into a table, which goes down. A chair breaks. Bud lands a thunderous hook and Lucian's nose shatters. Another and his cheekbone caves. Lucian drops like a rock. Tries to crawl under another table. IN A MANIACAL RAGE, Bud flips the table and stomps down on Lucian with furious blows that come one after another. Lucian tries to cover up. BUD IS ALL OVER HIM. Grabs Lucian by the throat and presses down. Lucian, fighting to breathe, digs his nails into Bud's face, tearing skin. Bud's face twists with hate as he chokes the life out of him. Lucian's eyes BULGE...His mouth stretches WIDE...clutching at Bud's fingers, trying to pull away... Bud SNORTS, tightens his grip... bearing down... And at the last moment, the cop in him reemerges... Bud lets go. Lucian rolls to his side and coughs up a thick ribbon of blood and vomit. Bud slams on restraints. Bud staggers to his feet...breathing hard...Spots Jesse on the floor...And he slows... Jesse lies in shadow. Perfectly still. We cannot see his face. Only the dark pool of blood around him. Lucian passes out.
C: BUD
D: I got him... I got Lucian.
E: into radio
N: SLOWLY PULL AWAY AND TRACK OVER THE MASSACRE... ...as POLICE come in...over bodies and blood and guns, and up the stairs and out a broken window, to the CROWDS in the street held back by POLICE, past flashing lights and emergency vehicles... ...to where life goes on in New Orleans. DIP TO BLACK.

S: INT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY
N: ON BUD, as he leads Lucian through the bowels of city lock-up. Lucian - in prison garbs, haggard, dark bruises - looks up as they pass a two-way mirror of an INTERROGATION ROOM, SEES... KIERSEY ...seated, making statements to Shepard, who is taking notes. Stacks of Jesse's reports surround them. Bud walks Lucian past, into...
S: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #2
N: ...and Lucian sits at a table. Bud across from him. Silence hangs, several moments. ON BUD starting again, knowing... There's something bigger. A slow smile spreads...
C: BUD
D: Want a cup of coffee?
N: THE END
