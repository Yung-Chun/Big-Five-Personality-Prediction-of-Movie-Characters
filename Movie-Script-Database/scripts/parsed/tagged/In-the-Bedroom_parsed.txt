N: THE SOUND OF WIND AND NOTHING ELSE
S: EXT. GI'S POINT
N: We are in the midst of a field of tall grass wild flowers. A long rutted road stretches into the distance. Faintly at first and then closer - we hear a woman squealing with laughter. We see her legs cut through the grass and fly up a hill. Close on her heels is a young man, a good ten years younger, in hot pursuit. Over the field - across the tops of blades, sits an ancient apple tree. We rise out of the grass and see the two young people under the tree. They are entwined - in a deep embrace.
C: CLOSER NOW
D: We see them in glimpses: Their eyes - Lips - Hands Finally they part - the woman rests her head on his chest. She reaches out and strokes his hand. He stares at their fingers mingling together. The woman sighs.
C: WOMAN
D: I Love it here. I know you do...
C: WOMAN
D: I can feel my life - ya know. He stares up into the boughs above him and sHd.les. A legend appears: Il -_ 1 THE SOUND OF BALLGAmE OVER:
N: T. RURAL ROUTE 90 - PREDAWN A BLUE 1973 CHEW PICK-UP winds around a corner and disappears down a long stretch of road. "And that's it from Fenway the final score Oakland 3 t1 Redsox 7. You have been listening to the re-broadcast of last night's game. This broadcast is the sole property of -- -)r League Baseball and cannot be-" -
S: EXT. EMERSON ROAD - S
N: The truck pulls onto a small road flanked by rows of 100 year old clapboard two-story affairs.
S: EXT. NATALIE'S HOUSE - S
N: Standing. on the lawn in front of one of them is the woman from the opening scene, NATALIE STRUT, prett - eautifl actually with a little more sleep. She stands wit two small boys who are doing their best to stay warm in the morning air. Her son JASON 8 , and his brother DUNCAN 4, who has his face buried in his mother's coat--refusing to see or be seen. The truck comes to a stop and two men get out. One is young, early 20's, and even at this hour his step is lively, his face full of warmth. He walks over to Natalie and gives her a kiss. The young man from the opening scene, rRANK FOWLER. The other man leans back against the passenger door. He is in his early 50's. Kind face, good looking, athletic in his day - Frank's father, MATT. He smiles at Natalie. Natalie smiles back.
C: NATALIE
D: Morn'in Dr. Fowler.
C: MATT
D: Morn'in Natalie. How you doing boys?
C: JASON
D: Great! Jason starts for the truck. Matt opens the door and the boy climbs inside the cab. Frank kneels down to Duncan.
N: Hey buddy ... you upset that you're not coming? Frank reaches out and puts his hand on the boys shoulder. Duncan pulls away. Frank looks up to Natalie for help. He can come if he wants ...we can manage, really. She smiles and shakes her head.
C: NATALIE
D: ahead. He wants to stay here.
N: Don't worry Dunk. You can come next time. ,Qy Natalie kisses him and they're off. INTO TRUCK - SAME - MOVING Jason in the middle. He glances over to Frank - a trace of hero :worship in his face. I NT. STROUT & SONS CANNERY - DAWN Sardines are processed at lightening speed. We follow them on their journey, which ends with the sealed cans being packed into cardboard shipping boxes. They are taped shut by a young man we will meet later (TIM, 3 ) . The tops read STROUT & SONS. I NT. ATKINS LOBSTER CO-OP - DAWN A double-55-gallon-drum wood stove is humping. Several men turn their bodies rotisserie-fashion around the thing, while making morning small talk - The starting price of lobsters, the prospect of repairs to their equipment, and so on. A SCARRED HAND scribbles some figures on a wall that has been used as a scratch pad for years. Two scales are emptied of RED FISH into a PLASTIC PICKLE BUCKET.
S: EXT. HARBOR - SAME
N: A pair of CANVAS TENNIS SHOES shuffle down a gangway. The bucket sways directly over them. A small hand struggles with the weight of the thing. A pair of BEACON FALLS waders appear - the shoes stop. A strong hand grabs hold of the handle - the shoes pick up the pace.
S: EXT. HARBOR - S
N: Matt & Frank prepare the rig. Jason stands on the dock, taking it all in. A field of LOBSTER POTS stacked like cordwood and surrounded by a collection of SCARRED BUOYS, GRAPNEL and coiled FISHING GEAR stiff with sea salt - all so wildly unreasonable as to seem exotic. Jason's eyes find the hull of "GIGI" an old Boudreau built lobsterboat. Starboard side covered in barnacles. C'mon up Jace.
C: MATT
D: Hold on a second. Need to know if he's ready first - Jason, can you tell me what's important? Jason hesitates.
N: on tell h° JASON (NERVOUS) "A shaft of sunlight at the end of a dark afternoon, a note in music-- He takes a breath.
C: JASON
D: and the way the back of a baby's neck smells if its mother keeps it tidy."
N: MATT (TO FRANK) You taught h' well. Jason beams.
C: MATT
D: - come aboard sailor. Matt reaches down to give a hand up. Frank turns the engine over. It roars to life.
S: EXT. HARBOR LATER
N: The sun is fast climbing into the morning sky as "GIGI" glides out of the channel and past a LIGHTHOUSE that sits Just off the point of a good sized ISLAND. Jason shields his eyes with his hand. He gazes out at the island. Matt comes up beside him and sticks a baseball cap onto his head. The crown reads U.S.S. CONSTELLATION.
C: JASON
D: Thank you.
C: MATT
D: Ever been over there?
C: JASON
D: No sir.
C: MATT
D: It's beautiful. Isn't an island anymore though. It's a city. They have electric lights. Artesian wells, even a jail lighthouse isn't manned anymore - it's run by a computer When I lived there, had no ferry then` so we didn't even have cars, can you believe that?
C: JASON
D: How'd you get back?
C: MATT
D: Off the island? Jason nods. We rowed. Matt smiles at the memory.
C: MATT
D: Then we got a little outboard. That was great. A seven and a half horsepower it was - we lived there until I was about your age - then we left and became "harbor people". Jason seems to be digesting this.
C: JASON
D: I a "harbor person"? Matt hides a smile about to form.
C: MATT
D: Yep, Jason - we all are. Jason is full of questions. Matt knows the answers and doesn't talk down to him. Something the boy is grateful for.
N: At the helm. His eye s inted from glare and cold. He cuts back on the throttle s and heads for the winch. GLOVED HANDS pull up a BLUE-GREEN BUOY and slide the MANILA LINE into the WINCH. A POT surfaces and Frank sets it "Doors up" on the edge. He opens the doors. His hands work quickly and efficiently. He tosses a SMALL CRAB back into the water, pulls out a LOBSTER and measures the back. Too small. Then a nice sized LOBSTER is pulled out - it's missing the SCISSOR CLAW. He hands it to Matt. Baits the trap. Throws the winch and the next pot surfaces. Matt sits inside, Jason on his lap. He reaches into a WOODEN BOX of RUBBER BANDS with a BANDING WRENCH and bands the crustacean's remaining CRUNCHER CLAW. Jason stares at the disfigured creature.
C: MATT
D: Oh boy you see what happened to this poor fel ow?
C: JASON
D: .what?
C: MATT
D: Well, the trap has nylon nets called heads--2 side heads at b ends, so the lobster can crawl in. The "Bedroom" head inside, holds the bait and keeps it from escaping--you know the old saying "two's company three-s a crowd"? Jason nods.
C: MATT
D: Well{ it's like that. You get more than two in a bedroom and chances are something like this is going to happen. That's why Frank can't leave these traps for more than a day. Matt holds up another Lobster and turns it belly-up. There are black balls on both sides of the tail.
C: MATT
D: Now the older females like this of gal, are the most dan erous - especially when they're growin' eyries.
C: JASON
D: Berries?
C: MATT
D: Eggs... .one of these can take out two males easy - Then you wind up with lobster you can't sell - and as for this fine lady, she gets off easy, the state says you have to let her go. Matt throws her back in the water. Holds up the other one to Jason.
C: TT
D: Can you handle this? Jason nods.
N: MATT (GENTLY) You sure? He really isn't. Matt hands it to him.
C: MATT
D: Go ahead now, put it in the tank. Jason can't get the thing in the tank fast enough.
S: EXT. FOWLER HOUSE - DAY
N: Looking around, you see a big yard, double lot. The grass is manicured to per ection, someone takes a lot of pride in their garden. In the middle of this sits a two story cape, post Hopper/Wyeth, early 20th Century - simple, beautiful, d you on't freeze in the winter. The truck backs up into the driveway, Frank j s out, drops the gate. Resting on the bed is a LARGE BOX wit a line drawing of a SWING-SET.
C: FRANK O.S.
D: Hey, dad can you give me a hand? The transistorized sounds of a baseball qame.
S: EXT. FOWLER BACKYARD LATER
N: Frank pushes Duncan, who sits proudly on his new swing-set.
C: D C
D: Higher! HIGHER! SMALL CHILDREN are everywhere. A serious Super Soaker Squirt Gun fight in progress.
C: ACROSS THE YARD
D: a steaming hot grill, with a huge assortment of hot-dogs & burgers. A spatula flips a patty. The sounds of Fenwav park emanate from a chea Dort able radio. WILLIS GRINNEL, early 50's, a stout, silver-haired man, works the grill. Standing next to him is Matt, his best friend for forty plus years. Matt takes a pull off a can of Moxie. Sets it down and searches through a plastic bread bag. Willis looks past him, distracted.
C: MATT
D: h, Ruth hates this kind. What?
C: MATT
D: I bought the wrong buns.
C: WILLIS
D: Maybe we can borrow hers. Matt follows Willis's gaze, to the object of his distraction: A PRETTY WOMAN IN TIGHT DENIM SHORTS. She-s bent over to wipe the ketchup-stained face of Jason .
E: he's wearing Matt's cap
C: WILLIS
D: Ah, what I would give to have back my youth.
C: MATT
D: Willis, you never had that in your youth. The woman turns around and catches Willis staring. It's Natalia. Willis looks down, nonchalantly rifling through the bun bag. Matt waves to a passing man in khaki shorts, FATHER OBERTI,
N: 50-S-

D: Father! You made it!

N: You want a beer?
C: NATALIE
D: I think I'll see if your Mom needs any help.
C: FRANK
D: Good luck. She laughs-He grabs and tickles her but she breaks away and escapes inside the house. Matt watches on, and falls into a wistful daydream.
C: WILLIS
D: Jealous? Matt turns to him and, to Willis's surprise, ever so slightly, nods.
N: I NT. FOWLER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - S Natalie walks in through the living room, pausing to examine a half finished ARCHITECTURAL MODEL that sits on a card-table next to a jigsaw puzzle. She looks toward the kitchen where a woman works at the sink. She takes a breath and starts there. I NT. FOWLER GARAGE - DAY
C: OF THE GE

D: Seriously, man. He still talks about you coming back. Says you're the best can packer he ever had. Be nods.
N: He always was a nice guy. TIM (EXHAUSTED) Are we there yet? Tim and Frank emerge from the side of the house. Willis cuts them off, grabs two beers.
C: WILLIS
D: Excuse me boys - an offering. Catch Father. He throws one to Father Oberti who sits talking with Willis's wife KATIE GRINNEL 50's, she is tal ing the priest's ear off.
C: KATIE
D: Becky went to the hairdressing academy after high school, but aft she got married and had the boys, she decided she wanted to stay home - she still loves doing hair though. Where do you go Father?
C: FATHER OBERTI
D: I just go to Super Cuts.
C: KATIE
D: You can't request the same girl at Super Cuts - you have to take what you can get. They don't know your hair - how can you get a good cut i they don't know the air? Father Oberti has the patience of...well,of a priest.
N: I NT. FOWLER HOUSE - DAY RUTH FOWLER 50, attractive, is washing and arranging vegetables on a plate. Natalie chops carrots on a cutting board. They barely make eye-contact. Natalie attempts small talk.

C: MATT

D: Oh reall ? How's the job? Your father t ake you back on at the cannery?
N: RIC (DRILY) That's funny. You're still getting checks aren't you? She ignores him
C: RICHARD
D: Ya see my new rig out there? Natalie looks annoyed.
C: NATALIE
D: Yeah - it's real nice.
C: RIC
D: It's not exactly new, I traded David the truck for it. It's got room for all of us - a good grocery gettin car. A moment.
C: RIC
D: You wantta take a ride?
N: NATALIE (LAUGHING) Jesus - you don't change, do you?.
C: RIC
D: Change? No, I don't change. Everything around me changes. You change. You take my house, you take my kids, you fuck this other y- No, I don't change at all.
C: NATALIE

D: For what? To fool them for a few days into thinking they have a real father, and then it's back to
C: RIC
D: I their father.
E: cutting her off
N: NATALIE (VEHEMENT) No, Richard. You know what defines a father? It's what he does, not what he promises. It's being a positive, consistent presence. Richard eyes her suspiciously. 13
C: RIC
D: "Positive consistent presence." Wow. What does that mean? I just don't get it. But I'm not fucking a college boy, am I?
E: mimicking ° her 
C: NATALIE
D: Look ...can you just go now? I really don't want you here when they get back.
C: RIC
D: Oh, no, wouldn't want that. He doesn't budge.

N: 'I. NAT IE' S HOUSE - FRONT YARD -,RUSK Frank's truck parked out front The lawn is littered with the boy's various plastic weapons a small wading pool. A children's television show is heard from inside. Natalie is sprawled out on a chaise lounge, nursing a beer, and sharing a cigarette with Frank, who is on his hands & knees finishing an elaborte structure with a set of FROEBEL wooden blocks.
C: NATALIE
D: You know I've been ignoring our difference in age, but if you keep playing with those blocks, I'm gonna start to worry.
N: They're not blocks - they're gifts.
C: NATALIE
D: I'm sorry I know they're a gift and a very generous one. I'm gust concerned that Dunk. might think e's a little old to be playing with them.
C: FRANK
D: They're not for playing - they're to learn about unity & balance. Froebel called them "Gifts." This is the second gift - a sphere, a cube, and a cylinder. A five year old can learn the difference in form depending on how they look at them. Why didn't he say so in the first place?
C: NATALIE
D: Oh ou said second gift. How many are are there?
C: FRANK
D: Twenty. A moment.
C: NATALIE
D: You've been pla in with these - excuse me, working wit t ese for how long?
N: Since I was about Dunk's age. My mom took me tough all twenty. So that's what a good mother does.
C: NATALIE
D: .oh.
N: FRANK ??0 Come on down here and take a look. She sets down her beer and Joins him. The small wooden structure looks like a home that could have been built by Lautner or Wright Frank looks pleased. Natalie is distracted.
C: NATALIE
D: Your Mother gave you these Frank - I feel funny Duncan having them.
N: Don't be silly, it was her idea. NATALIE (SCEPTICAL) Really? You're not looking at the house - look. It's not all mine, it's part Mack. Frank speaks excitedly, as he makes a quick sketch on a colored piece of construction paper using one of the boys' markers. See the whole ideal of what Mack was trying to achieve was a common area in the middle of the house. I mean - a large, common space wasn't uni e to Mack, but the idea of separating the family so that the kids were on one side and the parents on the other, so they would all spill into the center ... He looks over to Natalie, checking in. She smiles, and shifts her gaze. I'm boring you, aren't I? NATALIE (SOFTLY) No, not at all, I was just... . just thinking. About what?
C: NATALIE
D: About you. . ,school,
N: I'd rather talk about our house.
C: NATALIE
D: I know you would.
N: What if I wait a year? NATALIE A year's not going to make a difference.
C: NATALIE
D: You can't do that, Frank.
N: I've thought a lot about this.
C: NATALIE
D: But you told me it takes forever just to establish yourself.
N: Exactl , so what's a year in forever? Know w at Duncan said today? She can't suppress a smile.
C: NATALIE
D: You wouldn't be changing the subject would you?
C: FRANK
D: Yes.
C: NATALIE
D: What now?
N: He said, "Frank, I don't think Jason really understands girls." NATALIE (LAUGHING) He didn't! He did ... "understands girls!"
C: NATALIE
D: What did you say?
N: I said, "give him time, Duncan." They both break up. I didn't know what to say! if this is how he is now - boy are we in trouble- He stops short. The word - We - hangs in the air. They watch each other, unsure of how to react. Changing the subject quickly. Frank reaches down to the grass and comes up with one of Duncan's toys. A real musclebound superhero. Somewhat grotesque.

N: Frank sets it down. The HEADLIGHTS OF APPROACHING CAR rake across ACTION I NT. ROCKLAND HIGH SCHOOL MUSIC ROOM - NIGHT Half a dozen girls age 15 to 18, are gathered in Ruth's classroom. Desks and chairs are stacked up for summer recess. The girls are in shorts and T-shirts, one with a picture of the solar system, and another with the Pink Panther. Bri ht bathing-suit straps are visible around some of their nec s: This afternoon they were sw' °ng. A few look sleepy enough to be in bed already. Ruth stands with her arms up- keeping time and controlling the dynamics. A single girl sings "The Drone"` a low monotone one hears underneath the other voices. They sing the Balkan folk song "Oj Savice."
C: CHORUS
D: Oh, Sava, carry me across our quiet cool water. There is my dear village and in that village, the prettiest girl. Without embarrassment, they shriek they drone, and at their ease they whistle. The music transports these girls - who are normally pre-occupied with images of MTV and Brad Pitt, to a place of pure self. The song ends.
E: SUBTITLED
C: RUTH
D: That was really good! OK it's 7:30 we should stop. The girls gather up their things quickly.
C: RUTH
D: Remember when you sing these words- The way we feel about the harbor, is how the Balkans felt about the river Sava. The girls start out of the room.

N: DAD
C: MATT
D: Come on, Frank. Hold still. Ruth hovers, in shock.
C: RUTH
D: This was her husband, wasn't it? Frank nods wearily.

C: MATT
D: Press charges.

C: RUTH
D: What's to stop him from doing it again?
C: MATT
D: Did you hit him at all? Tell me you hit him! Enough so he won't want to next time?

N: (TO MATT) Did you call the police? Not yet.
C: RUTH
D: You didn't call them?

N: HEY A
C: RUTH
D: This isn't just some sweetie from Vassar, that you'll see on holidays, Frank. You're not in this alone. Frank rises and leaves the room.
C: RUTH
D: Please listen. The sooner you end this thing the better. Ruth exhales. She returns to Matt, who is leaning against the recliner, chin in hand, deep in thought.
C: RUTH
D: What are we going to do? Matt deliberates.

C: RUTH
D: It's not the first time she's played around. Matt seems relieved that she's talking to him. He sits on the bed and starts taking off his shoes.
C: MATT
D: She's not with the guy anymore.

C: MATT
D: Come to what? Frank hops back onto the dock and sets down the container.
N: (SMILES) You having to run errands for Mom. Matt ignores the jibe. Frank starts stacking holding crates. I'm thinking of building a couple hundred more traps - see if I can do better than break even. Matt doesn't comment. He picks up a crate and throws it up top.

The rain glides down their faces, mixing easily with tears. Matt steps up to Frank's open grave. The gathering watches as Matt peers down into the hole, silently speaking to it. He reaches down, grabs a fistful of dirt. Then tosses it into the open grave. Matt pauses, staring down, into the hole --- He steps back, as Father Oberti delivers the end of his eulogy. Matt looks blankly around, noticing the family's many friends includin ; Carl and Henry from the game, Willis and Katie, and Frank's friend, T° Matt's eyes linger on someone behind T° A LONE FEMALE FIGURE IN BLACK, away from the crowd.

A HAND REACHES IN, scoops up some of the casserole onto a small plate, and carries it to A SMALL CLUSTER OF PEOPLE standing in the middle of a much larger gathering, the reception after the funeral. Matt stands in the downstairs hallway. He looks around the room, as if it is all a dream. Children getting soda pop. Others in conversation. The odd person looks up at him, then turns away. Willis steps up to Matt. His wife, Katie, stands nearby. Matt doesn't seem to notice Willis. Willis puts a gentle hand on his friend's arm. WILLIS (SOFTLY) Can I get you anything?

His fishing cap. Matt starts to pick up. He takes Frank's clothes from the floor and places them on his bed. He looks at a dirty T-shirt in his hand. He brings it to his face. He inhales deeply, able to smell his son's lingering scent- Finally, he sets the shirt on the bed. Wanders around. Strays near Frank's drafting table- He reaches out, touching the table, grazing°the topogra h of scattered pencils - drawings strewn across it- The Froe e Gifts. He takes a seat at the table. Feeling its frame, the sketches, the seat below- And without warning he is overcome. He lurches forward, burying his face in his hands. The sobs come unrestrained, violently, like a sudden tidal wave.

N: . GRINNEL'S CR W-S NEST - DAY Willis opened this place after serving as a chief petty officer in the Vietnam War. The theme, if there is one, is definitely nautical. Snapshots of longtime customers are stapled on the walls between the booths and tables, two are framed, and prominent. They are from Willis' - -, days; The first an entry photo of A YOUNG WILLIS front of the ha f. The second a sun faded color photo of : att and Willis. Both ook to be in their twenties, both dressed in Navy Whites. The trade here is mostly ve early breakfast, and then lunch for the men who work at the leather and shoe factories. A MUTED news show plays on a ceiling at the far end of the booths. A sign on the wall reads T your "Forget about lunch" breakfast. Willis carries over two plates with omelettes, parks them on the table, and takes a seat across from Matt.
C: WILLIS
D: Don't worry, I didn't make em. Matt takes a bite. He winces.

D: They're keeping him busy, I'm sure - You know where they'll move h once he's sentenced? Matt shifts the focus to his omelette.
C: MATT
D: You have any Tabasco sauce? Willis pauses. He looks around, ca `out to the kitc hen.
C: WILLIS
D: Hey, Pete. Tabasco. Pete! Ah, shit. He heads to the back. Matt looks out the window. A refrigera ted truck with the STROUT logo on it's side pulls to a stop at the light. Willis returns with sauce in hand.
N: He takes a seat. Shifts his tone again.
C: WILLIS
D: Next weekend Matt- We really want you to come up to the c p- Katie's insisting. Not to pressure you or anything. But if you don't come se's going to invite her sister and that idiot and I know I'm going to wind up insulting him again. Matt considers this.

Given the schedule considerations on this docket, the court feels that we should conduct the probable cause hearing in tandem. Witnesses will be called at this time. Unless there are any objections to the contrary this court will recess until 2:00 p.m.
S: EXT. KNOX COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY
N: Natalie comes up the brick walk and enters the building.
S: INT. OX COUNTY COURTHOUSE LATER
N: A gray concrete room, washed out by the buzzing overhead florescent. Matt and Ruth sit on metal fold-out chairs, alongside twenty or so spectators, and a smattering of reporters, in the gallery. Richard unkempt and dressed in an ORANGE JUMPSUIT, sits patientiy next to one of his two attorneys. Matt and Ruth glance over at NATHAN STROUT, 62, sitting directly behind Richard. Nathan's two other sons, both big men like Richard, sit at his side. Nathan feels the Fowlers, stares. His eyes stay focused on the front of the room. Richard's trial attorney, MARLA S, 301s, smart, expensive, and a long way from her home in Boston, stands in the COURT WELL. Natalie Strout in the witness box. So, Mr. Fowler had asked you to go upstairs with your chil, ?z s your husband was trying to enter... DISTRICT ATTORNEY WILLIAM DAVIS, 40, rises.
C: DAVIS
D: objection. Mrs. Strout's police interview is already documented, the defense has a copy of it. There's no reason to waste anymore of the court's time . - .
C: KEYES
D: Your Honor, we just want to review exactly what s. Strout saw on the afternoon of July 17th. Isn't that why we're here? The Judge nods.
C: JUDGE
D: overruled.
N: (TO NATALIE) Please continue. Natalie tries to recapture her place. Keyes nods. MARLA KEYES (RECAPPING) So you were bringing your children up to their bedroom ... Natalie's glance wanders to the gallery, to Matt and Ruth. She,sits on her hands to keep them from shaking.
C: NATALIE
D: 0 Right. I was in Jason and Dunk's room I didn't know what was happening downstairs. I was getting worried. I asked Jason to read Dunk a story. He didn't want a story - He wanted to come with me ... so I sat him back down on the bunk and I left them in the room.
C: KEYES
D: You left "them"?
C: NATALIE
D: My boys. She starts to cry.
N: KEYES (SOFTLY) Of course - I'm sorry. on.
C: NATALIE
D: I closed the door...I moved down the hall. I looked back to make sure they weren't behind me. I had just started down the stairs, when I heard the shot. I ran down... A deep sob ...
C: NATALIE
D: .and Richard...
C: KEYES
D: I'm sorry, can we just back up? You said you "heard the shot"?
C: NATALIE
D: Yes.
C: KEYES
D: You "heard"? s- Strout, did you witness the accident? Prosecutor Davis jumps up.
C: DAVIS
D: b`ection. There are no grounds to in icate this was an "accident" The Judge nods.
N: JUDGE (TO STENOGRAPHER) Please strike "accident" from the record. (to Marla Keyes) Ms. Keyes, please rephrase the question. Marla Keyes hasn't taken her eyes off Natalie. They both know what's next. KEYES (GENTLY) Mrs. Strout ...did you actually see the sidearm discharge? I NT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY Davis hands a cup of coffee to Matt, who sits on a faux leather couch with Ruth.

E: to Ruth re: coffee
C: RUTH
D: I'm fine. Davis takes a seat across from them.
C: DAVIS
D: You see, we can't appeal bail - It's just not set up that way. RUTH - -y You let that bastard walk out and we're supposed to just sit here? Don't tell us there's nothing to do about this.
C: DAVIS
D: It's not us, s. Fowler. The state's bail code is to ensure future court appearances
C: DAVIS
D: In this case Strout's family was prepared to put up a substantial amount of property as bail - That, along with his ties to the community made it hard for us to convince the judge of a serious "Risk of Flight".
C: RUTH
D: Oh - I see.
C: DAVIS
D: It's not just your case. Now you can file a civil suit. I recommend it. But not now, wait till after the crimminal trial. Matt stares at a small cartoonish statue on Davis's desk. It is one of those things that were popular in the 70's. A little man chasing an ambulance. It reads "World's Greatest Lawyer."
C: RUTH
D: And when will that be? Next week, next month?
C: DAVIS
D: Well... honestly - anywhere between twelve and eighteen months?
C: RUTH
D: I thought you said there would be a jury trial sometime in October!?
C: DAVIS
D: If he was incarcerated the udge would move for an October date - basically to save the County the cost of housing and feeding him as an inmate - But with bail the court date, unfortunately, is always later.
C: RUTH
D: Oh my god, oh my god. Matt jumps in.
C: MATT
D: But you're confident you'll be able to put him away for good then... Right? Davis looks uncomfortable with the question. Ruth sees this. She gathers herself.
C: RUTH EJ
D: The things she said in there ...what is the damage?
C: DAVIS
D: Manslaughter.
C: RUTH DAVIS
D: What? Oh, Jesus Christ! The wav this is going, that'd be my bet - especially since Nathan Strout brought up that barracuda from Boston - she's very smart.
C: RUTH
D: This was no accident. Be killed our son in cold blood. Ruth.
C: RUTH
D: What?
C: MATT
D: How long would he be sent away for?
C: DAVIS
D: Hard to say really. Anywhere between five to fifteen years. We think we have a good shot at the max - fifteen. Even with good behavior, he'd do a full ten.
C: RUTH
D: Ten years? Five years? Are you out of your mind!? He killed my son. Does anyone know this? Matt looks at his shoes, as Ruth glares down Davis. Davis sits back, a little shook up.
C: DAVIS
D: I'm sorry, s. Fowler. I understand. Unfortunately, in situations like this when there is no eye witness, there ... well, there's not a lot we can do.

C: RUTH
D: Well there it is in black and white. You should read some of the things he says. Unbelievable. Matt takes a sip of coffee. He glances down at the paper. He nods, without really looking.

Are they okay? Natalie, choked by emotion, cannot respond. Near tears, she puts her hand up, unable to speak. Matt reaches out to touch her arm. His gesture is interrupted as: She pulls the cigarettes from an overhead rack. The Man pays. Matt stays a moment longer. There's nothing else to say. He leaves. She returns to her job.

She told me about a vision she had when she found out her daughter had died ...she saw herself at a great distance from the earth encircling it, an endless line - as she got closer she saw that it was made up of mothers traveling forward. She fell into line, and began walking with them. When they reached a certain point, the line divided. She said she knew - that all the millions of women on her side - were the mothers who had lost children-she seemed to find great comfort in that. Ruth doesn't react.

C: MATT
D: I'm just saying, Tim, if we could find something, something concrete. If you could just ... it could be just a slip of the tongue --- Tim looks into Matt's eyes, feeling the torment.
C: TIM

Their window rolls down. attractive girl with short brunette hair stares back at Matt. Lost in the absurdity, he doesn't look away. The light changes.

C: MATT
D: Something wrong? She doesn't turn around.
C: RUTH

C: MATT
D: Do you want to talk or not?
N: RUTH ("SEARCHING" ) Talk, talk ... oh, you must mean about our dead son. No, we haven't before, why should we bother now? They stare at each other across the kitchen. MATT (SLOW BURN) What can I do, Ruth? Ruth looks at him for a long time.

C: MATT
D: You're goddamn right it is. My choice is to not scream at the world. Maybe one of us has to be reasonable here, did you ever think of that?
C: RUTH
D: Reasonable? e, Matt, I don' t know about you, but I ss my son. I'm glad you have time for reason. That's what you imparted to Frank, That sense of reason - Oh, he thought you were very reasonable.

C: MATT
D: You've got to be kidding...
C: RUTH
D: You know it. Come on. You wanted it, and you couldn't get it - that's why you didn't stop him so you could get your kicks through your son. You know that's what happened. And now you can't cope with it. You can't admit the truth - To me, or to yourself - You can't admit that he died for ygur fantasy piece of ass. Matt, stunned, reels for a second And then, finally, explodes.
C: TT
D: You want to know why our son is dead, Ruth? He wasn't with her because of me, he went there because of you. Because you were so controllins, so overbearing, so angry that he was it, that he was our only one.
C: RUTH
D: That is not true.
C: MATT
D: It is! From the time he was little you were telling him why he was wrong. Everything he did was wrong. What was wrong with him, Ruth? She stares at him, dumbfounded.
C: MATT

N: RUTH (WE ) I just wanted to talk about what happened, Matt.
C: MATT
D: You expect me just to open up to you? Embrace you? You scare me. How can I talk to you? I can't even look at you. They suddenly become aware of the DOORBELL, ringing, over and over. They watch each other, both reeling, both out of breath. The DOORBELL continues.
N: MATT (COMPLETELY DRAINED) That's probably ... the police.
C: THE DOOR
D: Matt opens it. There is no cop, just Kristen Gellar, 12, a young gymnast who'd like to compete in Hawaii.
N: KRISTEN (REHEARSED) Hi there. I'm Kristen Gellar from the Rockland Gymnastics Association - Today we're selling brand name candy.

C: THE LIVING ROOM
D: Ruth is curled up on the couch. Matt stands over her, unsure of which way to go. He stares absently into the small mountain of candy in his hands - sets it on the coffee table He takes a seat at the other end of the couch.
C: MATT
D: Ruth...
N: RUTH (SOFTLY) Yes?
C: MATT
D: Ruth .001 had no right. . .what I said -0. no one, no one should ever have to hear that...

C: RUTH
D: I don't blame you, Matt. I just... that girl came by. She came by the school, and I couldn't forgive her. I was so... She lets go, crying hard. He lifts her head onto his lap. He reaches out, stroking her head, pulling her matted hair from her forehead as she sobs into his lap.
C: RUTH
D: I'm sorry. I have been so an - I keep seeing him, Matt. I've seen him. Matt nods, but he's not really clear.
N: MATT (CONFUSED) ..Oh I know - up in his room - Sometimes I swear Frank's in there - on the way home just now - at a stop light - for a second I COULD'VE-- RUTH (SOFTLY) Not Frank. Matt freezes. Then.
C: RUTH
D: Richard... She breaks into sobs.
C: RUTH
D: .and I don't know what to do.
C: MATT
D: Where did you see him?
C: RUTH
D: Eve here - Downtown, and the market. I saw at South End. He smiled at me, Matt - I keep running into him ... he s °led. Matt still strokes her hair. But he's in another world.
N: INTO GRINNEL HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT The game has just started. Willis deals. Henry, Carl & Willis pick up the old banter as if Matt had onl been away on vacation; but he can see the affection an courtesy.in their eyes.

C: WILLIS
D: Is there a problem?
C: HENRY
D: Why do you delude yourself with that crap?
C: WILLIS
D: What are you talking about?
C: HENRY
D: Look we're not in Vegas. It's five card draw, or seven card stud.

C: HENRY
D: Asshole, Matt smiles. He's missed these guys.
C: CARL
D: I'll open with a dollar.
C: HENRY
D: Raise a buck. The bet's to Matt. He stares at his cards for a very long time. Willis looks to say something, when Henry hits his arm. This stops him. Matt looks up. He sees the patience they are all exercising for his typical indecisiveness. This bothers him. He stares back down at his cards. Stalling, waiting for someone to bust him. He looks u at Willis - Henry - Carl. They all sort of smile uncomfortably. He can't take it.
C: TT
D: Oh, for Christ sake say something! This wakes them up.
C: MATT
D: Quit pussy footing around me d 't! You just gonna let me stare at these cards all night!? No one wants to make the first move. This upsets Matt even more.
C: MATT
D: O.K. fine! He stares back down at his cards. Finally it is Carl who speaks. There are things of which I may not speak; There are dreams that cannot die; There are thoughts that make the strong heart weak, And bring a pallor into the cheek, And a mist before the eye. And the words of that fatal song come over me like a chill: A boy's will is the wind's will, And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts. Matt looks up from his cards into Carl's eyes. The two men regard each other.
S: EXT. GRINNEL HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

N: I NT. GRINNEL HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT A few minutes later. Matt sits alone in the room. Be gets up to examine a picture hanging on the opposite wall. He's not particularly interested, he's seen it a million times, he's just killing time. A corner of the room devoted to Naval memories. A pristine version of Matt's U.S.S. CONSTELLATION cap serves as the center piece. Willis comes down from upstairs.
C: WILLIS

N: TT (SEARCHING) .I cruess he didn't want us to ow. He stares into his hands, as the memory crystallizes. Willis looks confused, and somewhat uncomfortable.
C: WILLIS
D: He gets up and heads to the bar.
N: MATT (TO HIMSELF) .had to put that dog down. Willis throws some ice in a tumbler.
C: WILLIS
D: I was thinking just the other day about the last time Frankie was- Matt cuts him off. His name was Ar k. Not Frankie. Willis looks stunned.
C: WILLIS
D: .I'm sorry Matt. I don't care ...he just never liked being called that.
N: WILLIS
C: O.K.
D: Matt nods. He looks away.
C: MATT
D: She didn't tell me, Willis. She never said a word - She saw him at South End.

N: THE SOUND OF A LONE F VOICE - SINGING
S: EXT. CAMDEN AMPHITHEATER - MAGIC HOUR
N: The voice is joined by another and becomes a duet. We turn to find the voices and see we are at the foot of a small knoll. A steeple in the distance pokes thorough the last blue husk as the sun dies. Looking around we see an ancient gazebo - then stairs leading up to a stone library - A boulder at the foot of another knoll - above - descending toward us - The girls, each holding a single candle,dressed in brightly embroidered smocks, enter in procession singing -Jennie Mae Mama. " The effect is beautiful and feels like a sort of quickening. The group proceeds down the hill and blossoms into an - AMPHITHEATER which faces the harbor.

D: All right. Richard looks at the gun, then gets out. He moves across the grass. Matt closely behind, looking at the row of small backyards on either side of them and scattered tall trees. He glances from house to house. Looking for signs of one insomniac neighbor, some man or woman sitting alone watching the all-night channel from Boston. All is quiet. They move up the back walk and to the side kitchen door. Matt stands directly behind Richard as he opens the door. It-s pitch black inside the duplex.

Matt can't help but glance at the sink and stove and refrigerator: no dishes in the sink or even the dish rack beside it, no grease splashings on the stove, the refrigerator clean and white. Matt becomes momentarily 2reoccupied with one of Duncan's drawings taped to its door.

The bed, a double one, is neatly made; the ashtray on the bedside table clean the bureau top dustless and no photographs- prob ly so the girl - who is scae? - won't have to see Natalie in the bedroom she believes is theirs. But because Matt is a father and a husband, thou h never ex- husband, he knows (and does not want to ow that this bedroom has never been theirs alone. Richard turns around; Matt looks at his lips, his wide jaw.
C: RICHARD
D: I wanted to work things out with her. Try to get together with her again. But I couldn't even talk to her. He was always with her. Dr. Fowler, I'm going to jail for it. I am going to jail. If I ever get out I'll be an old man. Isn't that enough ?

D: Gotta pee. Matt realizes Richard means to have privacy. He pushes him into the room. Takes a step back and pulls the door so it is only slightly ajar. He keeps his foot between the jam and the door. He eyes Richard's back reflected in the mirror. He can hear him make water. He looks like he wonders about allowing this courtesy. Mattes glances at: A picture on the wall outside of the bathroom: Natalie Richard and their two boys, in front of someone's house. Smiling. She looks happy.

Richard now d'_lhouetted in the doorway. Let's go. Richard steps into the hall. Matt follows, carrying the small suitcase in one hand, the gun in the other. They start down the hallway. Matt turns off lights with his elbow as they go. Past the living room into the kitchen. Wait. Richard tenses, he stops at the kitchen door. Matt sets the suitcase down. He uses that hand to reach into his jacket. He pulls out a red, white, and blue piece of paper. He drops it on the counter top. Words on the paper read AMT RACK. Matt picks up the suitcase again. He steps closer to him. Presses the gun into Richard's back.

D: They'll figure that out too. You think I wouldn't have done it myself if it was that easy? Silence. He starts it up, slides into reverse. He looks back over his shoulder as they back down the driveway. Matt averts his stare. Looking down at the gun barrel but not at the profiled face beyond it.
C: MATT

Swirling colors from behind catch their attention. Richard and Matt both look in the rear-view. A state trooper's car with its gumballs flashing races up in the distance behind them. Matt jams the gun into Richard's ribs and slouches down.

N: MATT WATCHES RIC S LARGE, BIG KNUCKLED HANDS TIGHTEN ON THE WHEEL. They crawl up the trail, the wheels crunching the gravel, the headlights shining into the dense woods. The road seems endless. Richard cringes as they bounce over a bump. Both of them eagerly peer beyond the windshield. Finally, at a great distance, the tiny lit windows of a cabin come into view. A BLUE CHEVY PICKUP is parked in front of the place.
C: MATT
D: Stop here. The Brown Suburban crawls to a stop. Richard keeps the engine running. Matt presses the gun hard against his neck. He straightens in his seat and looks in the rearview mirror. Matt's eyes meet his in the glass for an instant before focusing on the hair at the end of the gun barrel.
