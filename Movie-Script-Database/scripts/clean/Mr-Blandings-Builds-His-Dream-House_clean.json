{"Mr-Blandings-Builds-His-Dream-House": {"BILL": {"raw_line": "I suppose you're wondering what all this has to do with Mr. Blandings and his Dream House? Well, I'll tell you. Jim Blandings is part of the fabric of this town. Born and raised right here, he's as typical a New Yorker as anyone you'll ever meet. At least he was. And if you want to know the real story, I guess I'm your boy. Cole's my name, Bill Cole. I'm Jim's lawyer and quote, best friend, unquote. Jim's one of those bright young men from Yale. Advertising business, lovely wife, two fine kids, makes almost fifteen thousand a year. Want to know why? Just look up there.It certainly is.Perhaps \"steal\" is an understatement -- \"swindle\" might be a little more appropriate.Every time you get a little tight you weep on my shoulder about the advertising business and how it forces a sensitive soul like yourself to make a living by bamboozling the American public. I would say that a small part of this victimized group has now redressed the balance.You! You've been taken to the cleaners and you don't even know your pants are off!First time around you offered ten thousand dollars for fifty acres, right?That's two hundred dollars an acre. I know that part of Connecticut and one hundred dollars an acre is standard top-gouge price to city slickers. When the natives sell to each other it's around forty or less.Not two hundred and eighty-four percent. And besides, you're not getting fifty acres, you're only getting thirty- five, more or less.I refer to a rather obscure post- script on the back of the second letter from Friend Smith.You're not spending eleven thousand five hundred dollars for tennis courts!That's precisely the point. We're going to write this Hackett a strong letter and tell him he can either kick in with those fifteen acres, reduce the price, or find another sucker.You mean extortion.Like what, for instance?I don't care if General Grant dropped in for a scotch and soda -- you're still getting rocked!That doesn't make this a good buy....more or less...Thirty-one and a half.It's nothing, Your Honor, just a few less tennis courts.Congress ought to pass a law. When a man buys a house in Lansdale County there's a prize -- he gets ten percent off if he can find it.They are probably mills that have shrunk.Look -- you really want to find that house of yours -- it's no problem.Just pretend you're one of General Gates' horses and you're thirsty... Now where would you go for a drink of water?Well, I must admit it's a very beautiful thing.It's a good thing there are two of you -- one to love it and one to hold it up.What'd your engineer say when he checked over the foundation and that roof?I just saw it move.Look -- let me do you a favor. I've got a client, crackerjack structural engineer, Joe Apollonio; he practically built the George Washington Bridge single-handed.He's the follow who advised the Government not to raise the Normandie -- they didn't listen to him, cost them five million dollars.No thanks, I'll just stay out in the car and listen to \"Life Can Be Beautiful.\"Hello, Muriel. Well, you've done it again'. Once, just once, why don't you come to me and find out if it's all right, if it's legal, before you go barging off and run yourself smack into another jam!And I must say, Simms, I hold you equally responsible!Did you let this idiot tear down that house?I quite agree. But you're dealing with a man who doesn't think before he acts, who goes off half-cocked!You're an architect! You must have been aware of the legality involved.You knew there was a mortgage on that house.And you know the requirements in regard to a mortgage where there's demolition intended!With a man like this you can't assume anything!In clear, concise English, you tore down a house on which another man holds a mortgage without first getting his written permission.And in such case, the mortgagee can demand the full payment of said mortgage upon demand -- and Mr. Ephemus Hackett so demands! Six thousand clams! And he wants them now!You've got ten days.What'll you do for collateral on your building loan?I'm sure it won't be necessary. I'll see the boys at the bank. Maybe you can put up your insurance as collateral. If necessary, I'll sign a personal note.And Jim, do me a little favor. The next time you're going to do anything, or say anything, or buy anything, think it over very carefully, and when you're sure you're right -- forget the whole thing. Good night, Muriel.What's that?Oh.What's going on over there?Well? What happened to the trout stream, with that pure, clear, cold mountain water?What's wrong with that steam shovel?What Mr. Blandings means is -- what precisely is a ledge?...Like a ledge.\"Come to peaceful Connecticut -- Trade city soot for sylvan charm.\"On a hot day there's nothing like a nice cool limestone shower.If you ask me, this project's getting a little out of hand.Meansa we gotta blast.Hi.Just going over the Knapp contracts with old man Dascomb and I -- uh -- Can I talk?While I was in there with Dascomb the conversation kind of got around to you and -- uh --Well, he didn't say in so many words that ever since you started with that house you haven't turned in a decent piece of copy, but --...that if I told you, you'd know that he knew that you knew that he knew... that you knew... or something.Congratulations.What's this, another closet?Maybe it's that little room off the hallway.Do me a favor -- don't ever invite me here for a meal.You know these New York millionaires -- they're eccentric.After you, Rockefeller.I'll browse around upstairs.The door blew shut. I got locked in.Maybe for Houdini -- not for me.Nothing like that good old Yankee know-how.Leave a call for seven o'clock. Monday morning.Roger.What's a \"Zuz-Zuz Water Soft-N-R\"?You've got one.Another first!You've got it.Isn't there a later one?Maybe you can have the railroad push the train up to four-fifteen -- then you won't have to go to bed at all!Kind of hate to leave that little place. Just four walls and a couple of mothballs, but to me it'll always be home.Don't worry, I'll be on the job.When I married you two I suppose I took you for better or for worse.Good old Uncle Bill.Stay put. You look too comfortable.Oh, I'm not Mr. Blandings. Cole's the name, Bill Cole.Friend of the family. Wet clothes. Just came in out of the rain.Cole. Bill Cole. Friend of the family. Just came in out of the rain.That's fine. No bridge. How do I get back to Lansdale?Muriel, really! With your husband in New York and your children away -- think of my reputation.That's the story of my life.Don't worry about the man who gave the world \"When you've got the whim, say Wham!\"-- This well will never run dry.'Morning. Hello, Jim.Slept like a rock.We were at the two hundred twenty volt cable that goes to the stove.If you'll all excuse me -- I -- I think I'll just go up and slip into something a little more comfortable.Oh, Mr. Tesander -- could you give me a lift to town?Be right with you.In case anyone's interested, I'm leaving for town. If you want to count the silverware, I'll wait.What happened to him?Mind if I say something?You know, I've kind of been the voice of doom about this whole project. Every step of the way I was firmly convinced you were getting fleeced, bilked, rooked, flimflammed and generally taken to the cleaners. And maybe you were. Maybe it cost you a whole lot more than you thought it would. Maybe there were times when you wished you'd never started the whole thing. But when I look around and see what you two have here -- I don't know. Maybe there are some things you should buy with your heart and not with your head. Maybe those are the things that really count...

I wish you'd tell Gussie --Socks? In the closet?And there's so much of it in the closet!Well, thanks a lot!I'll try, dear.'Morning, dear.Excuse...If you don't mind, dear.Take your time. I can spare the blood.I cut myself every morning. I kind of look forward to it.Don't like them. No close shave.He doesn't have my beard!I'm not interested in discussing the grain and texture of Bill Cole's hair follicles before I've had my orange juice.Because I prefer the cool, clean sweep of the tempered steel as it glides smoothly --...Who did this?I have repeatedly told you -- -- don't cut up the morning paper until I've had a chance to look at it!I suppose this is another of Miss Stellwagon's so-called Progressive Projects?I'm not undermining anything. I happen to be in the advertising business and keeping abreast of the times is important to me.That's not the point.It certainly is not!You eat your cornflakes!I wasn't aware of the fact that our society was disintegrating.Muriel, I know it's asking a lot, but just one morning I would like to sit down and have breakfast without social significance!All right. All right. I'll listen.Well?...Go on.That's all?!No. Fellow wants to sell a house so he puts an ad in the paper. What did you expect him to do, take it to the United Nations!Oh, indeed... crass commercialism... advertising...Oh, she does?Perhaps your Miss Stellwagon is right. Perhaps I ought to get out of this \"basically parasitic profession,\" which at the moment is paying for her very fancy tuition, those extra French lessons, her progressive summer camp and for that matter, the very braces on your teeth!Why not, they spend enough of it!...Who?What's he doing here?...Estimates?There couldn't be two Bunny Funkhausers, could there?Then this is the same clever young man who's responsible for that zebra- striped monstrosity in the Collins' living room?Phil Collins told me what he paid for all that function! If you think I'm going to --Muriel!Mm.Red, yellow and green?!Not running away -- -- just backing off a little.Heaven forbid.If you'll forgive me, Mr. Funkhauser, what I'd like to visualize -- at this dreary hour -- is how much is this all going to cost?This wall is -- what?You're going to tear out the wall?!Can you give me a figure?Just a figure.Just an overall figure.Mm... Seven.That would be seven... thousand?We-ll. That seems fair. After all, we're not running away from color -- -- and we are tearing out walls -- Mr. Funkhauser, do you have a card?We will, dear.We'll talk it all out and then we'll get in touch with Bunny.I'm sure we will.So nice of you to come. Good day.No, that would be too logical! Seven thousand dollars! Blueberry pie! I wouldn't put seventy-five cents into this broken-down rat trap!That does not make it a national shrine! Seven thousand dollars and not one word about closets.I haven't got that kind of money!Sometimes I'm beginning to wonder!That's not a bad idea!Sorry.'Morning.Hm?Of course, you understand, Mr. Smith, we're just window shopping, so to speak. Nothing really definite in mind.Mm. Not a bad-looking place, but it's certainly a lot older than anything we had in mind.You don't say! How's that?Oh! Old General Gates -- Civil War.Oh. Oh, that General Gates. Hear that, honey, General Gates!Mm.I guess it doesn't hurt to take a look.Like taking candy from a baby.Shh. Just keep quiet and let me handle this.Tell me, Smith, what kind of a price is the owner asking for this old place?Shh!Funkhauser will have nothing to do with this house! Shh!Well, you don't say.Mr. Hackett, we've just been talking to Smith here about -- uh -- taking the old place off your hands.\"Home, home in Connecticut With a closet to hang up your petticut...\"\"No hustle or fuss No Fifth Avenue bus --\"Hm?Like... say... a lawyer?Muriel, for once in my life I'm going to make one small decision, on my own, without the legalistic machinations of Mr. Bill Cole.Muriel, I don't want to hear another word about Bill Cole! Well, did your mother tell you about the house?Well?Did it ever occur to you two that there may be some remote, intangible subjects upon which your Miss Irma Stellwagon is not the final authority?...You know it's just barely conceivable -- What kind of a house?Oh, it... revolves... with the sun?Who lives next door -- Buck Rogers?!Muriel --Now just a minute! What kind of children are these? Do you want to spend the rest of your lives in chromium tents and portable merry-go-rounds? This house was built before our country became a nation. It has dignity. It's -- it's --From Smith!Mm.\"I have conveyed your offer of ten thousand dollars to Mr. Hackett and am sorry to say he is not interested. However, I feel...\"He's bluffing. Simple as that.Muriel, I'll let him push me to ten thousand, two hundred, but not a penny more!What do you think, Bill? Steal, huh?Well, it wasn't much, Bill. I just saw a good thing and I -- What do you mean?What are you talking about?Never mind, Muriel! All right, just what's wrong with this deal?What of it?The man's entitled to a fair profit.Where does it say that?All right, so it's thirty-five! What's the difference? Do you know how many tennis courts you can get on thirty- five acres?That's not the point!We'll do no such thing! I'm not going to queer this deal over fifteen broken- down acres!You don't understand business.Now wait a minute! You can't measure everything on a slide rule. This house has certain intangibles.Like antique value, for instance! It just so happens that General Gates stopped right there, at that very house, to water his horses.That was a different war!Let me explain something. To both of you. For fifteen years I've been cooped up in a four room cracker box! Just getting shaved in the morning entitles a man to the Congressional Medal for bravery.Bill -- Muriel and I have found what I am not ashamed to call our Dream House. It's like a fine painting. You buy it with your heart, not your head. You don't ask, how much was the canvas, how much was the paint? You look at it and you say, \"It's beautiful... I want it,\" and if it costs a few pennies more you pay it -- and gladly -- because you love it and you can't measure the things you love in dollars and cents!Well -- that's how I feel about this place. And when I sign those papers Saturday, I can look the world in the face and say, \"It's mine! My house! My home! My thirty-five acres!\"What was that? How many acres?I was under the impression your property was thirty-five acres, Mr. Hackett.What in the world are \"Shrunk Mills?\"Who needs engineers? This isn't a train, you know.This house has been standing since the second year of the Continental Congress. You take one look at it and shingles start to fall off!Thanks a lot, but we're not building a bridge.You have my word, if I were raising the Normandie, I wouldn't make a move without Apollonio. Now would you like to come inside and look around?Of course, any small changes would have to conform with the character of the countryside.Well, uh, what's your professional opinion?Tear it down??!Thanks a lot.Bill Cole and his experts!Uh-huh... mm-hmmm... uh-huh.Mm. New house... New house.Hm... New house...Just... what sort of thing do you have in mind?Well, I -- What do you think, Muriel?Yes, Simms, if we were going to build a house we want it -- well, you know -- just a little bit different.Now, for instance --Oh, you can just shove those stairs in anywhere.You do that, Simms, but remember, we've got to hold it down to ten thousand.Twelve-five! Well, I guess we're not going to quibble about a few pennies one way or the other.Why don't we just blow on it?Fine. You just shoot ahead with those plans, and remember, try to keep it down to ten, ten-five.There's one good thing about getting that old relic down. Those original beams and everything -- this time somebody pays us.Well, so far it's cost us thirteen thousand, three hundred and twenty- nine dollars and forty-five cents.Honey, you heard Simms. As the house stands now it's over fifteen thousand dollars!That's right, dear, cubage.Oh -- just a figure of speech.Cubage. It's just the number of cubic feet that -- -- go into a cubic foot. Go on, Simms.Yes. You see, er, my daughters are, er, approaching womanhood, and, er --Hmmm. What about that silly flower sink? We could eliminate that.Or that sewing room upstairs, that's certainly a waste.Honey, I've got to have some relaxation.Sure, and get poison ivy!For thirteen hundred dollars they can live in a house with three bathrooms and rough it!Muriel, Simms explained to you. We've just got to cut, cut -- What's that?Well, isn't that just too bad! Let me see that.Prutty. Mrs. Bildad Prutty. Get a load of this! \"The semi-monthly meeting of the Lansdale Historical Society was turned into an uproar last night when its president, Mrs. Bildad Prutty\" -- How do you like that, Bildad Prutty? -- \"reported the total demolition by its New York buyer of the historic old Hackett house.\" Bildad Prutty! Muriel, I've got to send this to the New Yorker!\"Mrs. Prutty,\" -- Bildad, that is -- \"reminded her audience that several years ago the Society started to raise a fund to purchase and restore the old house to its original condition.\"\"The project fell through by being seven hundred dollars short of the sum of twenty-six hundred dollars...\" \"...which Ephemus Hackett testified was the lowest reasonable price he could accept as --\"...Twenty-six hundred dollars.Muriel, isn't it time for those children to be in bed?What's eating you?What? What happened?What if he did? What of it?What is it? What did I do?What? What legality?What happened? What are you talking about?Just one minute! I am entitled to know what I did! This is America! A man's guilty until he's proven innocent --You go to bed!Bill, I've had a very trying day. Would you mind telling me in clear, concise English just what crime I've committed -- and why?!Well, I -- I did?!Now?!Muriel!No, Simms, I'll work this out. You go ahead with your final plans and let's see some estimates.Six thousand dollars!I don't know, turn in my insurance policies or something.Why not?I'm not dead yet! And if I die, there's plenty left to take care of them.Thanks, Bill.What's with this kissing all of a sudden?Just because a man is helpful in a business way, it doesn't give him extra-curricular privileges with my wife!Well, I don't like it. Every time he goes out of this house, he shakes my hand and he kisses you.Well, I don't like it, that's all! Why is he always hanging around? Why doesn't he ever get married -- or something?Well -- it -- it doesn't look right. There are limits to friendship and --I suppose so.Do you think it's worth all this?It's getting awfully crowded with only three bathrooms.Don't bother, Simms. I'm getting to be an old hand at this sort of --Jumping H. Mahogany --!!Never mind. If you'll just send us a bill for your services, I'll see that it's taken care of. Now, if you'll excuse us.I am going out to get my head examined! Then, if I don't jump off the Brooklyn Bridge, I'm going to find the owner of our building and sign a twenty-year lease!What's the name of that contractor?Well, things are certainly humming.I said, humming.That's Mr. Tesander. He's digging our well.I decided against it --The trout stream -- didn't seem practical.Well, anyway, I'd rather have artesian water. It's healthier. Calcium -- vitamins -- artesian --Better take a look.What's the matter, Mr. Zucca? Something wrong?What did you do, strike a boulder?What does that mean?Blast?What do you mean, dynamite?Like a boulder?But how far will you have to blast?At twenty-four cents a foot? Do you realize what that means?!Well, anyway, our house will never sink.How long does that go on?I think I'd better have a little talk with Mr. Tesander.Oh -- Mr. Tesander --Mr. Tesander!How's it coming?No -- no -- I mean --Mr. Tesander!What I meant was -- how far down are you?Well -- isn't that pretty deep?Do you think maybe you'd better try another spot?I mean -- well, have you hit anything yet at all?Is that good?That's bad?Oh...That's bad?That's good?...I see.Nothing's getting out of hand at all. I've made a chart of the whole operation, and -- with a few minor deviations, I know exactly what every penny's going to cost.And just what does that mean?You see, Mary, the average fellow who builds a house doesn't know where he stands from day to day -- but I do things a little differently. With a few minor deviations I know exactly where every penny is going --Bill! Come in, come in.Sure. What's up?What is it?But you kind of got the feeling...What's he worrying about? The deadline's three months off. I've always --Yes, Muriel. What? What's that? Tesander struck water! Say that's wonderful! We've finally got our well.Huh? What's that? What do you mean we've got two wells? I'll be right out. Come on, Bill, we'd better get out to Lansdale.Mary, have you ever seriously considered building a house?You stick with that boy, he's got a great future.You mean you hit a spring, a bubbling spring right here in our cellar?Water, Mr. Tesander.At six feet!And over there, just thirty-two yards away, you had to go down two hundred and twenty-seven feet to hit the same water.How do you account for that, Mr. Tesander?This happens to be our dining room.Then where's the dining room?That's the breakfast nook.Oh.I think I'd like to go outside.Sure.The -- second -- floor -- lallys?Oh. Oh, the lintels between the lallys?Un -- umm. No, I guess not.It sounded less... expensive to say no.Now look what you've done.Look, men, Mrs. Blandings didn't mean anything. I mean, there's no point in walking off a job just because... a woman makes a silly little remark.What's what?What happened?Impossible. I had this closet built especially for myself. The lock opens from the inside.Nothing to it. A child could work it. Look, I'll show you.You see, it just takes a little good old Yankee know-how.Ridiculous. Even you could do it.Come on, I'll show you.Hey! Hey! Somebody let us out of here!If I could just get over to that scaffolding...Seems a shame but I guess it's the only way...Don't get panicky, I'll get you out of here. Here, hold this over the window.Stand back, Muriel.Ready?Funny... always worked before. Huh. I wonder...\"Home, home in Connecticut -- Where you have to conform to local traditions, customs, politics and etiquette...\"Sure, why not?That's nice. What do you mean, Bill's driving you?I mean that every time I turn my back Bill Cole's driving you some place or something.I thought he was a lawyer! Why isn't he out suing somebody?We'll just see about that!Mr. William Cole, please. Hello, Bill? I want you to fight this thing! I know my rights as a citizen! They can't get away with it!... What do you mean, what am I talking about? The letter, of course. From the owner of this building. They want us to move! It's a thirty day notice! But that's ridiculous. How can I move into a house that isn't even finished?! No windows, no plaster -- or paint, or -- or plumbing! Now you listen to me! I have no intention of moving in thirty days! This is not legal! I'm going to fight this thing! And I don't care if it takes every penny I've got! Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... All right!We're moving in thirty days.Where's Simms?What's the problem? You put windows up.Oh, they don't, don't they?What's this about the windows?Well, has he got mine?Where are my windows?!What are we supposed to do -- live the rest of our lives in a house without windows?How should I know?\"Furnishing and installing one Zuz- Zuz Water Soft-N-R, two hundred and eighty dollars!\" I will not have any such piece of equipment in my house!From what?!Mm. Well, if it's necessary, put it in! We're moving in today, you know and --Oh. Then get me the bill for it!All right then.I thought you were going to take care of it.You mean seven-fifteen.What about the seven-fifteen I'm supposed to take to the office every morning?!Let me see that! Muriel!That's fine! For the rest of my life I'm going to have to get up at five o'clock in the morning to catch the six-fifteen, to get to my office by eight, which doesn't even open until nine -- and which I never get to until ten!So I could get home earlier to go to bed earlier to get up earlier!So long, Bill.Hmm? What are you talking about? Bill's going to Europe.Uh-huh... Mm-hm. Mm-hm... Uh-huh. All right, come on, come on. Get busy.Now look what you've done!Next time we want a fire I'll send out for a three-year-old child! Get that stuff cleaned up and go in and help Gussie set the table. It's getting late.Pins? I only had one.All right, all right. Just put them away.Huh? Let me see that. Hmmmm.That's none of your business!People do not read other people's diaries! It's not a very nice thing to do! Now go in there and help Gussie with the table.I'll take care of that. Now, shoo, shoo.To shave.While I can still trust myself with a razor. At six o'clock in the morning I'd probably cut my throat. Goodnight.Muriel, do you have to do that now?!I'm not irritable!Sometimes a man doesn't feel like talking.No.It's not due yet!I'm not upset. It's just that I don't happen to approve of falsehood and deception. Particularly in my own wife.Oh, nothing. It's just that I distinctly remember your telling me you gave back Bill's fraternity pin fifteen years ago.Well, did you or didn't you?Give it back to him.Then perhaps you'd have the goodness to explain how this happened to fall out of your jewel box?What's so funny?If you were so crazy about the guy, why didn't you marry him?!That's not what you said in your diary!Well -- it happened to fall open and... I... happened to look at it. It... just happened.It's all over the book so why don't you admit it? You were in love with Bill Cole!Then why did you marry me?...Muriel?...Honey?Would it do any good to say I'm sorry?Well -- I am. I acted like a schoolboy and I'm sorry.Why do I love you so much?What for? The windows are all open anyway.Yes, I guess so.Goodnight.You'd better send out for coffee and sandwiches,... It looks like an all night session.Tomorrow morning.I rather got the impression it had better be good.Funny how you look forward to the little things. Rain, for instance.For a month now, I guess I've been looking forward to the first rainy night at the house. Big blazing fire. Muriel knitting. Me in my new smoking jacket... with my pipe and slippers, reading my paper... Oh, well.\"Compare the price, compare the slice, Take our advice -- Buy Wham!\"\"If you'd buy better ham.

We'll take care of it.Fine.You do that.Muriel, there's only one thing on my mind -- This house -- and how fast we can get rid of it!Maybe it's not. Maybe I'm thinking I was once a happy man! I didn't have a closet, I didn't have three bathrooms, but I did have my sanity, a few dollars in the bank, two children who loved me and a wife I could trust!I also had a job at Danton and Bascomb, something I don't happen to have at the moment!That's right, I've resigned! We're starting all over again! From scratch! And without this house!I hate it!Every word of it! Anybody who builds a house today is crazy! The minute you start, they put you on the list. The All-American Sucker list! Everywhere you turn they've got a hand in your pocket. If you take out their hands, they find more pockets! It's a conspiracy, I tell you, a conspiracy against every man and woman who want a home of their own! Against every boy and girl who were ever in love!What do you want?!Twelve dollars and eighty-six cents! Why be a piker, Mr. Tesander? Take everything I've got! Spread it out among your pals! Wouldn't Retch like a little something? Maybe Zucca could use my new dinner jacket? It's open house, Mr. Tesander! Help yourself! If this isn't enough I'll come over to your place and do some odd chores. Maybe I can mow your lawn or scratch your back!...W-what was that?I don't know, dear... I don't know.Bill, be patient with me. Maybe one of these days I'll grow up.I'm on a... kind of a vacation.Well, not exactly, I --What did she say?Darling, give Gussie a ten dollar raise!Drop in and see us sometime.", "clean_line": "mm mm

sock drawer?Oh. Well, try your underwear drawer.Well, they must be somewhere. Socks just don't get up and walk away by themselves.The closet! That's where they are. We put them in the closet.Well, there didn't seem to be any room in the drawers......so Gussie and I decided that from now on we'll keep them in a basket on the shelf.Jim, I do wish you'd make an effort to be a little less clumsy.Excuse...Sorry.Moment, dear.Oh... cut yourself?Why don't you get an electric razor?Ridiculous! Bill Cole's been using one for years.That's silly. Bill's beard is just as tough and coarse and --You don't have to carry on so. I only said, why don't you get an electric razor?Stop writing advertising copy! Hurry up, dear, you'll be late for breakfast.Now dear, there just isn't any point in sending your children to an expensive school if you're going to undermine the teacher's authority in your own dining room.And so is your children's education.It certainly is.Joan, every time your father and I have a lively discussion we aren't necessarily bickering. What is it, dear, another English composition?Jim, you really might take a little more interest in your children's education.There must be more to it than that. Isn't there, dear?I wish you wouldn't discuss money in front of the children.Funkhauser? Oh, Mr. Funkhauser!Uh -- better ask him to come up.Oh -- uh -- darling, Mr. Funkhauser's here.You remember, Bunny Funkhauser, that clever young interior decorator we met at the Collins' cocktail party?Well, I imagine he's brought the -- uh -- estimates.Darling, you know how long we've said we've got to do something about this apartment, and, well, he called last week, and I had him come over, and he's got some simply wonderful ideas!Why, no, dear.That couch is terribly functional.Darling, please! Children, you'll be late to school. Run along and --Never mind, dear.Good morning, Mr. Funkhauser. You remember Mr. Blandings?Jim, just wait till you hear. He's got some wonderful ideas for the foyer.We want this room to be very gay, dear. Something in bright reds, yellows and greens.Dear, it's a wonderful notion.Jim, we haven't even discussed the rest of the house.Now darling, you -- you just don't go to a man like Funkhauser and ask how much it's going to cost before you even know what he's going to do!It's our home, Jim. Betsy was practically born in this apartment.Closets! You wouldn't even let him get to the bathroom!The way you talk, Jim Blandings, you'd think I was some kind of congenital idiot!You can just get out of here!It's simply charming!That is, for an old house.Wouldn't that make the house over a hundred years old?Well --Well -- I -- suppose as long as we're here...It does have possibilities. Do you think we can get it?Now don't lose your head.It's wonderful, Jim! That master bedroom with those two closets!Funkhauser could do wonders with this --You certainly have a lovely place here, Mr. Hackett....Jim?Uh -- Jim?I was just wondering, dear. Ten thousand dollars is such an awful lot to offer --That is, for two people who don't know anything at all about real estate, or anything... I mean, don't you think perhaps we should have asked someone's professional advice?Well, Bill knows about these things and --It seems very peculiar that when your very best friend happens to be one of the very cleverest young lawyers in New York City --Children, you haven't even seen this house yet.Well?Oh, dear. Maybe we should have gone a few dollars higher.Dear, I told you. I said we should call Bill --Forty dollars an acre!\"Incidentally, Mr. Hackett has been a little over-optimistic about the acreage. It will probably survey somewhere in the neighborhood of thirty-five acres, more or less, but I feel sure...\"We were just going window shopping and so far it's cost us eleven thousand five hundred dollars and they even made us pay the commission!I wonder if we could get another two year lease on the apartment?I think Bill's absolutely right.Our house. Our home. Our thirty-five acres...Well, you certainly aren't much of a help.The house and the lilac are just the same age, Bill; if the lilac can live and be so old, so can the house. It just needs someone to love it, that's all.I think you'd better contact Mr. Apollonio.It has charm, hasn't it, Mr. Apollonio?And yet still be functional.Darling, we'll get our own experts.You mean... for the same money... we could build a brand new house?I think it sounds fine.It's very nice, I'm sure, but -- uh -- well -- doesn't it seem just a little bit conventional?You could always move the chimney somewhere else, couldn't you?No, you'll find Mr. Blandings never quibbles about pennies.But we've got the nicest vacant lot in the state of Connecticut.It's impossible. I don't see how we can cut another inch.Well, it just doesn't seem possible -- for a house with such small rooms.What's that?But what does it mean?I beg your pardon.If we're going to eliminate anything, we'll lose that ridiculous play room in the basement with that great big poker table.We've got thirty-one and a half acres. Go out in the back and do a little gardening.I'm sorry. We couldn't possibly.I refuse to endanger the health of my children in a house with less than four bathrooms.What's so funny.Now girls, I don't want to tell you again.Excuse me.Why, Bill!Girls!Girls, say your good nights and off to bed without another word.You keep that in mind, dear. It'll help prepare you for motherhood.And we'll just forget about that extra bathroom.Now, Jim, you can't do that.What if something should happen? You can't leave the children unprotected.Not if you cash in your policies.Good night, Bill.What a wonderful friend.What's that?That's a fine thing to say about a friend of fifteen years!Would you prefer it the other way around?!Because he can't find another girl as sweet and pretty and wholesome as I am.Darling, let's not be silly about this. It's not Bill, it's the house you're upset about.Of course, darling. We're not just building a house -- it's a home. A home for ourselves -- and our children -- and maybe our children's children.Twenty-one thousand!We've only asked for the barest necessities --Where are we going?It wasn't exactly a decision, dear. We discovered the trout stream dries up in August and the rest of the year it's polluted.Jim!Thank you, dear.What do you mean, \"What do you mean?\" Mr. Zucca just explained. He's going to use dynamite and blast until he gets rid of the rock.If it does, we can always get Mr. Apollonio. He raised the Normandie.I don't know. Three weeks now at four dollars and fifty cents a foot.Mr. Tesander, just for the record, of course, what ever happened to water?Two pennies.Not the dining room, dear, the living room. There's the fireplace.It's not the breakfast nook, it's the powder room.Stop it! Stop it!I'm just sick. From the outside this house looks like a grain elevator, and on the inside everything's miles too small.What's that?That noise -- listen. It's coming from the closet!You know, dear, it's just possible the lock worked for you and not for Bill.Thank you.Oh, dear.What are you going to do?In case of emergency -- break glass. Come on, Bill.Never mind, Betsy. Dear, I'm going up to the place this afternoon to see about landscaping. Bill's driving me.Why do you always say, \"what do you mean,\" when you know perfectly well what I mean and what you mean?He's only being helpful.Another word and you don't get your laboratory.What is it, dear?Jim, what's the matter?...Well?Now I want the living room to be a soft green. Not quite as bluish as a robin's egg, but yet not as yellow as daffodil buds.The best sample I could get is a little too yellow, but don't let whoever mixes it go to the other extreme and get it too blue. It should just be sort of a grayish yellow green.Now the dining room I'd like yellow. Not just yellow, a very gay yellow.Something bright and sunshiny. I tell you, Mr. PeDelford, if you'll just send one of your workmen to the A&P for a pound of their best butter and match it exactly, you can't go wrong.This is the paper we're going to use here in the foyer. It's flowered but I don't want the ceiling to match any of the colors of the flowers. There are some little dots in the background, and it's these dots I want you to match. Not the little greenish dots near the hollyhock leaf, but the little bluish dot between the rosebud and the delphinium blossom. Is that clear?The kitchen's to be white. Not a cold, antiseptic hospital white -- a little warmer but not to suggest any other color but white.Now for the powder room, I want you to match this thread. You can see it's practically an apple red. Somewhere between a healthy Winesap and an unripened Jonathan.Will you excuse me?Joan, you know father was to take care of the heavy dishes.If they've run off somewhere it certainly isn't very --Heavens!I thought you were.Oh, dear, don't tell me I read it wrong.Perhaps if you started earlier you could quit earlier.Jim, you clean up this mess. I'll drive Bill to the station and pick up some cold cuts for dinner.I'll scout around and find you a place in Lansdale. Now, you're not going to change your mind about coming up?It won't be easy. I promise you a Cook's tour of every lamp maker, rug weaver, and antique shop in Lansdale County.Good old Uncle Bill.Where are you going?Tonight??Excuse...Excuse...There's no need to be so irritable just because you have to shave at night.Well, you're certainly something! You haven't said a civil word all evening.What is it, dear? Something down at the office?Have you got the new slogan for \"Wham\"?Well, it's something. You're certainly upset about something. I can always tell.What are you talking about?Did I, or didn't I what?Of course I did. If I said I did, I did.You! You're jealous! You're standing there with your face full of soap and you're jealous.Because I wasn't in love with him!Oh, now you've been reading my diary!I'll just bet!Don't be absurd! Of course I was in love with Bill. In those days I was in love with a new man every week.I'm beginning to wonder! Maybe it was those big cow eyes of yours or that ridiculous hole in your chin! Maybe I knew that some day you'd bring me out to this thirty- eight thousand dollar icebox with a dried-up trout stream and no windows! Or maybe I just happened to fall in love with you -- but for heaven's sake, don't ask me why!I don't know.Oh, Jim!Why don't you take the soap out of your ears?Darling, it's awfully late.Maybe you ought to go down and lock the doors.Jim, you have to get up at six o'clock.Goodnight, dear.Thank heavens! The children.I'm Mrs. Blandings.Thank you. I was beginning to get concerned. Can I make you a cup of tea?Goodnight... and thanks so much.You'll just have to spend the night right here.Don't worry, Snow White, you'll be as pure and unsullied in the morning as you were the night before.Poor Jim, he sounded so worried before. I certainly hope he comes up with something.Darling, you must be exhausted. How did it go?Is... everything all right?Well... they certainly weren't changes.I haven't done anything! And what I did was... just nothing at all.Well -- All I did was one day I saw four pieces of flagstone left over from the porch that were just going to be thrown away because nobody wanted them and I asked Mr. Retch if he wouldn't just put them down on the floor of the flower sink and poke a little cement between the cracks and give me a nice stone floor where it might be wet with flowers and things. That was absolutely all I did.Absolutely. Just four little pieces of flagstone.Of course I didn't. All I said was I wanted a nice stone floor and Mr. Retch was just as nice as could be and said, \"You're the doctor,\" and that's all anybody ever said to anybody about anything.It was just four little pieces of flagstone, and I only ---The bridge was roped off and Bill had to stay last night.Thank you, Gussie. You'd better get breakfast started.Where were we?How could they be, dear? The bridge was closed.Well, it was closed last night.Now dear, you're upset, you've got a lot of things on your mind --That's not what you're thinking.That's a fine thing to say!Jim!You love this house!You don't mean that.Thank you very much, Mr. Tesander.What did you mean before about losing your job?
