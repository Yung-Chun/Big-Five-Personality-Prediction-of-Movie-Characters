She fires two shots directly at CAMERA.I'll do better next time.(In German w/ English(In Italian w/ English(In Spanish w/ EnglishA hundred and twenty with scraps.What?How much is that?Good night. He stands by her bed looking down at her.No. ERIK takes HANNA'S gun out of his pocket and puts it on the table next to her bed.Sorry.What's music like?Try. He opens the encyclopedia again, leafs through the pages and reads.But how does it feel? Erik is not equipped to answer such esoteric questions.Tell me properly. Can you play music?I'd like to hear it for myself.How soon? Erik looks away from her questioning eyes.I'm ready. I'm ready already. They look at each other- he weighs it up.I live in Leipzig. German city. Population 0.7 Million people. We live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz. I go to school at the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium and my best friends are Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess. I like literature and sport, in particular tennis and athletics. I have a dog called Trudi.I didn't need your help.I'm ready now.You told me to think for myself. Isn't that what you want? She is angry for the first time. ERIK does not answer. Just stares at her.I want to see things. I can't stay here forever.Hello little foxy... foxy loxy... come on... come and share my breakfast. The fox comes to her and nervously accepts the scrap, withdrawing a few feet to eat it. HANNA shuffles forward carefully and gently pats the snow fox - it is only a cub.Did you see it? Wasn't it beautiful, like thunder. I had to stick my fingers in my ears it was so loud. Did you hear it? She stops, sensing ERIK'S mood.What's wrong? Sitting in front of ERIK is a metal case, caked with frozen dirt. ERIK pops open the case. Inside a tangle of technology. HANNA looks at the case, mesmerized.What does it do?You're not scaring me. He looks at her disbelievingly. She shakes her head in protest, but simultaneously moves away from the switch. He softens towards her.That's sad. ERIK awkwardly turns the page to change subject.If you want.Me?I'll stay.Marissa Wiegler.Marissa Weigler.Postcard.What?Wilhelm Grimm's house. Stephanstrasse 260. 10559, Berlin. Germany. ERIK moves a strand of hair from HANNA'S forehead and looks at her with paternal care.Father... He turns to look at her, both their eyes full of trepidation.I'll see you there.I was told by my father to gain the upper hand.Where am I?I see.Is that a camera?Camera obscura, it's Latin for \"dark chamber\".It was first described by the Arabic scientist Ibn Alhazen in the year 1021.I want to speak to Marissa Wiegler.Where am I?Where did you meet him? The false MARISSA pauses.Hanna.I live in Leipzig. German city. Population 0.7 Million people. We live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz. I go to school at the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium and my best friends are Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess. I like literature and sport, in particular tennis and athletics.I also have a dog called Trudi.No. I prefer to walk.Are you Arab?Morocco. Capital city Rabat. Places of interest. Marrakesh. Essouaira. Religion Islam. Language Arabic (in Arabic w/ English(in Arabic w/ English(in Arabic w/ EnglishThank you. HANNA stares at the light switch.Do you have one of these in every room?It's electricity? The HOTEL OWNER looks at HANNA askance.I know a little bit about electricity. They say Edison discovered it, or was it Franklin?What is it?The forest. The HOTEL OWNER smiles, himself a little puzzled by this strange encounter, and leaves. She just sits there staring at the TV as it's volume seems to increase. Meanwhile the electric kettle begins to boil. Steam pours from its spout and the whole contraption starts to rattle violently.I'm thirsty.I don't think so.My father encourages me to be independent.She's dead.People die.Three bullets.Good night. But the family are too wrapped up in their discussion to notice her.Did you know that 71 percent of the earths surface is covered in water?I'm fine.Please. She tries it.It tastes like music.Yes.No. I won. HANNA studies the sea.Can you help me get home? At that moment one of ISAACS photocopied pictures of HANNA rolls across the deck and catches on the railings. HANNA looks down at it, recognizes herself and quickly pockets it. She looks across the deck, too many people, she shouldn't have let herself be so exposed.You could do me a make-over if you like?Am I?I'm not a man. SOPHIE laughs even more. The door swings open and SEB is standing there with RACHEL, nervous but determined.Yes yes I'm ready! ISAACS is getting closer, walking between the cars. The ferry gates are open and the noise subsides. SEB discovers the crowbar, examines it.Guten Morgen.Gutm und Ihnen?Ca va. Oui. Bien... HANNA starts efficiently helping SEB erect the children's tent. He's watches impressed as HANNA expertly ties complicated knots. RACHEL and MILES start blowing up two inflatable mattresses.Food. SOPHIE lets out a shriek of nervous laughter, while SEB and RACHEL are confused as to what the appropriate reaction might be.What do you mean?It's like paint.I can't walk in this.Where are we going?I shouldn't take unnecessary risks.What do they call this music?Will you teach me to do dancing?How can you tell?Are we going to kiss now?Kissing requires a total of thirty- four facial muscles. Their lips are almost touching.The most important muscle involved is the orbicularis oris muscle, which is used to pucker the lips - He kisses her. HANNA closes her eyes. ISAACS moves in. FELICIANO becomes more ardent, puts his arms around her waist, she doesn't like it. He tries to open her mouth with his. HANNA snaps. In a few swift moves, HANNA pulls FELICIANO round and throws him to the ground. She falls to his side and, with one knee on his back, she holds his head, about to snap his neck. SOPHIE turns and sees them on the ground. A few of the closest DANCERS also stop dancing and stare. ISAACS backs off, watching from a safe distance.Should I let him go?I'm going to go now.It was nice. And she's gone, pulling SOPHIE away through the crowd. ISAACS jumps into action. But he's lost sight of the girls among the mass of dancing bodies. HANNA and SOPHIE move quickly through the crowds towards the exit.My father taught me. They escape through a hole in the perimeter fence.No.Yes?Leipzig, I live in Leipzig - SOPHIE looses her patience.Are we friends?I'd like to have a friend.I like you too. I really do. But there are things I can't tell you. Do you understand?There are people that want to harm me. Bad people.And they wont stop.So for your own safety... HANNA looks into SOPHIE'S eyes.Can we still be friends?That's just it. Neither do I. She reaches into her bag. Brings out the DNA report. Shows it to Sophie. They read. Interfering Sequence. Abnormal.I think it's about me. DNA is kind of how we're made I think. I mean who we are. They look at it.I'm going to Berlin. I have to meet my father at the house of Wilhelm Grimm.That's right. SOPHIE sighs at HANNA.Did I say the wrong thing again? SOPHIE looks at HANNA, sees she's vulnerable. She takes a bracelet off her own wrist. Gives it to her.Thank you. HANNA stares at the ceiling, looks over at SOPHIE who's starting to sleep. HANNA reaches out and touches her hair. Beside them, separated by a thin piece of fabric, we see that MILES has woken and has been listening in the darkness.How long until you drop me off?...they can live at freezing temperatures for up to nine months without food. Imagine that, nine months.I read it in my Encyclopaedia. HANNA is looking in the side view mirror. She sees ISAACS BMW and frowns, she's seen it before.Also, they can jump around 200 times their own body length, which makes them the best jumpers of all known animals except for the froghopper. Now they can really jump. RACHEL makes a turn and HANNA checks the side view mirror again. Yes, the BMW is still there. HANNA becomes anxious.I think so. But HANNA'S face betrays her concern.No, don't.I think you should stay where you are, Sophie. HANNA doesn't take her eyes off the mirror. She can see the silhouettes of ISAACS and his MEN. They don't move and neither does HANNA. Both are waiting for the other to make the first move.Please.I'm sorry. But you really mustn't get out of the van. HANNA climbs into the back of the van and comes very close toWhat ever you do, don't follow me. Promise not to follow me.Are you Wilhelm Grimm?What happened to it?It's beautiful.Have you heard from him? He nods.Please. HANNA takes an egg, breaks it and swallows it raw. KNEPFLER smiles. He gives her a buff envelope. She looks inside - some money, a passport, ID cards.I don't really understand.Do I have to?I don't know. I miss the forest. I miss my home.I suppose. She drinks her water, thinking.Did you know my mother?What was she like?Yes...It's him.How much?How does it work?No. He smiles in amazement and logs on for her. The owner brings up a search engine.(In German w/ EnglishAre you my father?Are you my father?Are you? Moment of electric silence between them. ERIK does nothing but she knows the answer is no.What's wrong with me? ERIK flinches slightly.Where was I born? ERIK knows he has to tell the truth.What's that?What kind of research?How did you know about it? ERIK's stares right at her.Disposed of?Keep away from me. ERIK approaches her. With real conviction.You mean I'm a killer?Don't touch me.Let me go. He releases her. She goes to the door.You didn't prepare me for this. And her look is so full of pain that in that moment ERIK knows he has done a terrible wrong. She starts to leave down the fire escape. ERIK calls after her.I am looking for a train to Galinka.Where can I stay? He points. HANNA sees the hotel.Do you have a sandwich?The same.I am tired. I need to sleep. She leaves the bar. HANNA walks back up the stairs. BUSINESSMAN follows.I have this much. Can you take me to Galinka?How much further?Please. But no smile from him, nothing. HANNA gets out. Starts to walk as the taxi turns and drives back the way it came.I'm going to Galinka. Can you help me? A woman's voice, German, in German.I was born there. But I've never really seen it. Why are you going?Yes...It's okay. MARISSA hands her some tissue. HANNA bandages the arm.You're not German. Are you American?Sorry.I don't know what to do. Nothing is what I thought it would be. It's... ugly and cruel and I don't know where to go, or... I'm stupid. I don't know what I expected... MARISSA secretly, genuinely affected by this. Fights the emotion that has surprised her. Human warmth.I like music.Where are we? MARISSA calms herself instantly.It's so small.Thank you for the ride. You're very kind.Thank you. She gets out and shuts the door behind her.You're Marissa Wiegler. HANNA starts to shake. MARISSA has her gun pointing at HANNA but her expression is the same sunny, uncomplicated smile as earlier. Dead silence. HANNA breathing fast. MARISSA speaks in English.Where are the other children? She looks at MARISSA, who waits, then answers quietly.I don't believe you.You killed my mother.No more. No more. Tears are streaming down her face as she reaches sight of the tunnel mouth and the daylight beyond. Standing in silhouette is MARISSA. HANNA slows her pace and stops when she can see the white of MARISSA'S eyes and the finger on MARISSA'S trigger. MARISSA raises the gun and aims at HANNA - but HANNA comes forward again, walking calmly towards her. She stops and drops her gun to the ground.Everything I see is nothing I want. MARISSA looks at HANNA, her gentle, childlike countenance. She smiles.No. I don't want that. HANNA turns her back on MARISSA and starts to walks in the opposite direction. MARISSA watches her walk away. HANNA walks waiting for the shot to come.The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. HANNA sits down on a tree trunk outside the cabin and pours some milk into the bowl, then drinks a little for herself.Home to millions of species, including humans, Earth is the only place in the universe where life is known to exist. She raises her head and makes a small clicking sound. Her friend, the snow fox, appears from the trees. The fox now has a small family of cubs. HANNA watches as the cubs approach the milk and begin to drink.The planet formed over four and a half billion years ago, and life appeared on its surface within a billion years. HANNA sits back and feels the sunlight on her face. Above her the trees are beginning to leaf.It is expected to continue supporting life for another one and a half billion years, after which the rising luminosity of the Sun will eliminate it all. HANNA surveys her beautiful world.", "clean_line": "missed heart stands pulls old pistol waist holster fires shots directly camera ll better time german english italian english spanish englisha scraps

Right now. I've killed you. HANNA spins spraying deer-blood on to the snow and brings her fist right to ERIK's face. He blocks and thumps an open palm on to HANNA's shoulder sending her sprawling into the snow. She leaps to her feet, as ERIK aims a kick at her head. She dodges, punches below his knee cap, and goes for her pistol. ERIK slaps the hand away.Use your hands! She goes for the gun again and again he stops her. He moves in tight, pulling the gun from its holster and tossing it deep into the forest. HANNA clips ERIK'S temple sending him to the ground. She wraps her arms around his neck preparing to snap... ... but she can't. He throws her over his shoulder into a pile of snow. ERIK stands and wipes the snow from his pants. His face shows a touch of frustration. He plods into the forest.Drag it back yourself. HANNA drags herself to the deer's side. She stares at its dead face.What's wrong? Are you hurt? She keeps swirling her spoon.You were half asleep.German.Italian.Spanish. HANNA studies her food and slowly takes a spoonful.How much did you pull off the deer?About 200 pounds in total? HANNA nods.That explains it.How you beat me. You're getting strong. HANNA almost blushes. ERIK stands to put his bowl away.(In Spanish w/ EnglishI'm glad you didn't snap my neck.The Great Blue Whale is the largest animal to have ever existed. A blue whale's tongue weighs over two and a half tons and its mouth is large enough to hold 90 tons of food and water.It's bigger than the cabin. Its heart weighs thirteen hundred pounds and a male has seven gallons of testicles. HANNA smirks.The Blue Whale's \"music\" can be heard for over 500 miles. He shuts the book.Time for sleep.Did you forget something?Good night. He walks to the door. HANNA stops him with a question.It's difficult to explain.Good. It feels good. It's, uh, nice.Your mother could. She used to sing very well.You will soon enough.When you're ready.Just go to sleep now. I'll see you in the morning.Again. They reset. She repeats the motion. Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist.Again. Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist. She's getting faster. Her strikes are solid.Don't give up! Don't give up! HANNA's arms flails as she fights against the stream and she screams in pain. She is grabbed under by the undertow and is pulled downwards. For a second she is underwater and in darkness but ERIK's hand pulls her back up and she breaks the surface with a gasp of relief.Maybe. ERIK relaxes. It's a false beat. He lunges again at her, really violently. He seems to be really trying to hurt her. But HANNA has reached under her mattress and there is a flint knife - in an instant it is at ERIK's neck. She pricks his neck slightly. It bleeds just slightly. Stillness and silence. HANNA breathless, angry.You didn't tell me you had a knife.One, two, three, four......five, six, seven, eight......nine, ten. After 10 paces, ERIK makes a 90 degree turn and enters the tree line. The snow and mud crunch under his boots. We continue to inter-cut the following with more close-ups of HANNA training: climbing, fighting, chin-ups, shooting. All the while we continue to hear ERIK counting out his paces. After 40 paces, with the cabin light distant, ERIK falls to his knees. He unsheathes a large knife and jams it into the frozen earth.It tells Marissa Wiegler where we are. He looks at her, a hint of a challenge.When you want to leave here all you have to do is flip that switch. She approaches the box and places a single finger on the small red switch.But once it's done, there'll be no going back. She'll never give up until you're dead, or she is. You understand? I wont be there to hold your hand. So be sure. Be sure it's what you really want.It's here. There's no rush. Take your time. HANNA turns her back on the box, but can't help taking another look at it over her shoulder.Laika, a mongrel dog from the streets of Moscow, was the first animal to orbit the Earth. She was launched into outer space on the third of November, 1957. Scientists believed humans would be unable to survive conditions of outer space, so flights by animals were viewed as an experimental precursor to human missions. Her rocket was not designed to be retrievable, and Laika had always been intended to die.When a star collapses the supernova explosion is 10 billion times brighter than other stars. HANNA shuts her eyes and tries to imagine how bright that might be.Will you hunt with me? Hanna is sweeping the ground.It's up to you.Yes. HANNA eyes the box sitting open, it's waiting for her.Fine. ERIK leaves abruptly. HANNA continues to sweep the ground, her movements bring her closer to the metal box. She stops sweeping and looks at the box. She turns and walks out of the cabin.You were lucky to grab that deer. There was nothing out there today. ERIK looks over at the meal HANNA is preparing.Smells good. He wraps an arm around her shoulder. They don't hug much and it shows. HANNA is almost defensive and tense. And then the hug is over.Hanna... HANNA looks up, still trying to hide her fear.Tell me again?Then?Then?The address where we meet.Good night my sweet girl. He stands and quietly goes to the door when her voice stops him.You can do this. You're ready. Just remember what I've taught you. She smiles reassuringly at him.I need a room.I stayed here fifteen years ago. It hasn't changed.Neither do I.Olsson. Peter Olsson.Thank you. ERIK reads: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMission accomplished\u00e2\u0080\u009dFor what exactly?You were supposed to be dead.Well, here we are.I killed one of your men. Got his cellphone. You've gotten soft.You got kids?Hanna's practically yours, you know? This goes straight to an ache that's been building inShe's true and good and funny. Yeah, she's funny. She's special. You should see her.You'll have to catch her first. The line goes dead. MARISSA puts the phone down and sits quietly for a moment. Then presses play again on the tape machine.You won't find anything. HANNA turns in shock.Marissa would have been much too careful for that. HANNA stares at him. ERIK HELLER.Sit down Hanna.Sit down.Please.I was going to tell you. HANNA sinks to the floor. Breathing fast.Nothing.At Galinka.It was a secret CIA research programme in rural Poland.Children. HANNA stares at ERIK.It was run by Marissa Wiegler. The science came from the old East Germany. The money from the CIA. The intention was to explore whether small genetic changes could be made to embryos... to improveReduce capacity for fear. For pity. Increase muscle strength. Heighten senses. Anything that might make a better soldier. HANNA looks up, stares at him. It's her he's talking about.I worked for it. She stares at him. He hands her a piece of paper from his pocket.This is what you were looking for. HANNA reads. It is an invitation to Johanna Zadek to participate in the Galinka project. A projected date of arrival at the Galinka Centre. A date - 23rd February 1995. An agreed fee to be paid to Johanna. Five hundred American dollars. An agreement to give up the child and have no legal claim over it. The letter is signed by Erik Heller.I recruited your mother at an abortion clinic in May 1994. She was about to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. Some boy at a disco. HANNA looks at the paper in shock.I had recruited twenty women. She was the last. She was different. Two years later I heard the programme was to be terminated. The research \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisposed of\u00e2\u0080\u009d.I tried to save all of you. But you were the only one I was able to rescue.Hanna listen to me.It worked. You worked.No... no.. He makes to touch her. HANNA springs back in violent repulsion.We have a new identity for you. A new life. A new beginning. She stares at him, then pushes past him. ERIK stops, pushes her back but then HANNA grabs a sharp letter opener.Don't. She attacks, ERIK pushes her to one side, grabs her. A fight in the apartment. Chaos, photos of Johanna crashing, lamps and bookshelves falling. HANNA murderous, ERIK just defending himself, not willing to hurt her. But then she overpowers him, has a knife to his throat.I tried to prepare you for what your life would be.Hanna wait. He looks out to watch her go. It's then ERIK sees the cars coming across the estate scrubland. ERIK turns in panic. And dashes back into the apartment, runs through the destroyed living room, and out through the front door.So go ahead. She stares at him. Wants to make this as painful as she can for him.Don't under estimate what you created.", "clean_line": "dead right ve killed hanna spins spraying deer blood snow brings fist right erik face blocks thumps open palm hanna shoulder sending sprawling snow leaps feet erik aims kick head dodges punches knee cap goes pistol erik slaps hand away use hands goes gun stops moves tight pulling gun holster tossing deep forest hanna clips erik temple sending ground wraps arms neck preparing snap throws shoulder pile snow erik stands wipes snow pants face shows touch frustration plods forest drag hanna drags deer stares dead face wrong hurt keeps swirling spoon half asleep german italian spanish hanna studies food slowly takes spoonful pull deer pounds total hanna nods explains beat getting strong hanna blushes erik stands bowl away spanish englishi glad snap neck great blue whale largest animal existed blue whale tongue weighs half tons mouth large hold tons food water bigger cabin heart weighs thirteen pounds male seven gallons testicles hanna smirks blue whale music heard miles shuts book time sleep forget good night walks door hanna stops question difficult explain good feels good uh nice mother sing soon ready sleep ll morning reset repeats motion hand knee elbow fist hand knee elbow fist getting faster strikes solid hanna arms flails fights stream screams pain grabbed undertow pulled downwards second underwater darkness erik hand pulls breaks surface gasp relief maybe erik relaxes false beat lunges violently trying hurt hanna reached mattress flint knife instant erik neck pricks neck slightly bleeds slightly stillness silence hanna breathless angry tell knife seven paces erik makes degree turn enters tree line snow mud crunch boots continue inter cut following close ups hanna training climbing fighting chin ups shooting continue hear erik counting paces paces cabin light distant erik falls knees unsheathes large knife jams frozen earth tells marissa wiegler looks hint challenge want leave flip switch approaches box places single finger small red switch ll going ll dead understand wont hold hand sure sure want rush time hanna turns box help taking look shoulder laika mongrel dog streets moscow animal orbit earth launched outer space november scientists believed humans unable survive conditions outer space flights animals viewed experimental precursor human missions rocket designed retrievable laika intended die star collapses supernova explosion billion times brighter stars hanna shuts eyes tries imagine bright hunt hanna sweeping ground yes hanna eyes box sitting open waiting fine erik leaves abruptly hanna continues sweep ground movements bring closer metal box stops sweeping looks box turns walks cabin lucky grab deer today erik looks meal hanna preparing smells good wraps arm shoulder hug shows hanna defensive tense hug hanna hanna looks trying hide fear tell address meet good night sweet girl stands quietly goes door voice stops ready remember ve taught smiles reassuringly need room stayed years ago hasn changed olsson peter olsson thank erik reads \u00e2 mission accomplished\u00e2 exactly supposed dead killed men got cellphone ve gotten soft got kids hanna practically know goes straight ache building inshe true good funny yeah funny special ll catch line goes dead marissa puts phone sits quietly moment presses play tape machine won hanna turns shock marissa careful hanna stares erik heller sit hanna sit going tell hanna sinks floor breathing fast galinka secret cia research programme rural poland children hanna stares erik run marissa wiegler science came old east germany money cia intention explore small genetic changes embryos improvereduce capacity fear pity increase muscle strength heighten senses better soldier hanna looks stares talking worked stares hands piece paper pocket looking hanna reads invitation johanna zadek participate galinka project projected date arrival galinka centre date rd february agreed fee paid johanna american dollars agreement child legal claim letter signed erik heller recruited mother abortion clinic terminate unwanted pregnancy boy disco hanna looks paper shock recruited women different years later heard programme terminated research \u00e2 disposed of\u00e2 tried save able rescue hanna listen worked worked makes touch hanna springs violent repulsion new identity new life new beginning stares pushes past erik stops pushes hanna grabs sharp letter opener attacks erik pushes grabs fight apartment chaos photos johanna crashing lamps bookshelves falling hanna murderous erik defending willing hurt overpowers knife throat tried prepare life hanna wait looks watch erik sees cars coming estate scrubland erik turns panic dashes apartment runs destroyed living room door ahead stares wants painful estimate created"}, "MARISSA": {"raw_line": "Well I'll be.What the fuck is he doing there?The son of a bitch.

ERIK awkwardly begins to change into the suit.Trouble was he had his own way of doing things. Kinda paranoid. WALT fires up a computer screen and logs on. He uses an access code. This takes him to a new file. He enters the tracking device number. A name comes up. ERIK HELLER. He clicks on a link. HELLER's face pops on to the screen.Not a team player. Not a \u00e2\u0080\u009cjoiner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He became increasingly isolated and disturbed. Kept mouthing off about classified programmes.

WALT hits a new link: A still of the same young woman as the photo HANNA was previously looking at in her bedroom. Her name printed below it: JOHANNA ZADEK.Never heard from him again.Bring him in.- Walt. This is exactly the kind of shit we can't have out there anymore. He was one of ours, we trained him. He kills some other poor woman and it's a cluster fuck.You don't have to. I'm making the call. BOB and WALT exchange a look.Thank you, Gentlemen. That'll be all. The video screen flickers off, people take their files and start to leave. MARISSA WIEGLER stands in the darkness.What is it?Go ahead.How did that happen?What's she saying?Tell her I'll be there tonight.Just do it.Tell her it was by a news kiosk in Alexanderplatz, East Berlin. Say it was raining.What tests? As the argument continues, we see and hear on the screen the FALSE MARISSA continuing to talk to HANNA.Send the results straight to me. On the screen FALSE MARISSA is talking to HANNA.Get her out of there.Have you got the DNA results?Okay. I want you to focus on Erik Heller.I'm in conference.Back off, honey. I'm busy. MARISSA'S response is so fierce that the AIR STEWARD instinctively does as he's told.I'm dealing with it Lewis.I don't want any bad news Lewis. Neither of us can afford a fuck up. MARISSA hangs up. She enters a converted car park which is now a lap dancing bar. It's early in the day and the patrons are as scarce as the clothes on the dancers. At the far end of the room is the reason Marissa is there, MICHAEL ISAACS. Mid fifties. Rumpled suit, bleary, unshaven and drinking a scotch. ISAACS smiles coldly at MARISSA.They let them in, they just don't let them get dressed. He smiles, drinks, she eyes the scotch.Still drinking on the job. You haven't changed.Adapt or die.I'll wait until I really need one. He grins and drinks. She sits, with a sigh, looks him in the eye.Erik Heller's still alive. ISAACS glances up from his drink.There's more. MARISSA passes him a newspaper. He opens it. Hidden inside is a picture of Hanna. He looks it over, surprised.He did a good job.She just tried to kill me.The fuck does that mean?I didn't teach her.Here's the problem: She thinks we killed her mother. He smiles wryly.Sure, just as soon as she's done breaking peoples necks. You get her sectioned, if you can catch her. The drinks arrive, MARISSA drinks.Right now she's in Morocco but she'll be trying to get out of the country. Find her and bring her to me. Quietly.Don't spend it all on candy. She glances meaningfully at the STRIPPERS, who have been eyeing up ISAACS as a potential mark. ISAACS looks at the money. When he looks back up MARISSA is already walking out the door.Keep me posted.Hello Katrin. KATRIN slams the door shut in fright and double locks it. Fear racing through her veins, she rushes her way through the lounge, knocking furniture as she goes.Well here I am in the flesh. KATRIN'S mouth twitches with all the imagined conversations she's had with MARISSA.Has Erik Heller contacted you?Huh, if only.That depends on whether you believe he's innocent, or not.- What's in the past, stays in the past, right?So why all the years of snooping around and sticking your nose in?Kid's, they fuck you up, don't they?What?Put him on.So were you.How did you know I was here?No, I just grew up. The world's changed since you died.No, I made choices.Not interested. But she is.I'm looking forward to it.Would you please stop crying?Honey, your friend is in a lot of danger. You need to help us find her.Do you know him?He knows you.But you knew she didn't have a passport. You smuggled her into port and helped her illegally gainThere is no Klaus Kohle Gymnasium. It closed five years ago. Shock on Rachel's face.Did she give any idea of where she was going? Rachel wracks her brains.This was Hanna's mother, Joanna Zadek. Fifteen years ago Hanna's father shot her to death on a camping holiday by the Baltic. RACHEL swallows, goes pale.You know, Mr Lyall, it's days like these that I really hate my job.It's a very, very difficult thing to do.But sometimes children are bad people too.I'm not going to hurt you. MILES shrinks from her touch.Miles is a nice name. Are you a nice boy? She strokes MILES' hair and immediately he starts crying loudly. SEB pounds on the wall from his cell.Three days ago Hanna's father killed two Danish policemen on a beach with a hunting knife.He's still at large and he's still very dangerous. We need to find Hanna before he does. Pause. SOPHIE thinks about it but clams up. Marissa notices.If you know anything at all, it's vital you tell us for her own safety. We are now very worried about her.Wilhelm Grimm wrote fairy-tales. He died two hundred years ago. MARISSA hands ISAACS a brown envelope containing one of the photographs she took from KATRIN'S apartment. The photograph shows a happy looking JOANNA and ERIK at a busy family amusement park. Between ERIK and JOANNA is a clown, his arms around both of them. This we will come to understand is KLAUS KNEPFLER. Behind them is a GRIMM'SWilhelm's house. Drive on.Check the attic. Footsteps to the attic.Erik Heller? Do you know him?Really? MARISSA shows him the photograph of JOANNA, ERIK and KNEPFLER outside the house.Think very carefully He shrugs and MARISSA grabs KNEPFLER by the throat. He speaks in gasps.When?Take him in there. Find out what he knows.Lewis. It's Marissa. HANNA hears the name. The name of the woman she thought she had killed. Her face pale in shock and fear.You got anything? He's coming here. I can smell it. Double the men. But, Lewis, I want to talk to him. HANNA hears MARISSA hang. Another pair of shoes enter the room. Male. ISAACS.How much does he know about the programme?What does he know about the child?Well that's good.Crazy bastard. You got a fix on him yet?Hanna?She's not coming here.That's him. And the car swerves to follow him. Thus moving unknowingly away from the slight figure of HANNA. HANNA can see the cars in full chase of Erik Heller. He has distracted them.Drop it. MARISSA steps out of the doorway, her gun trained on him. There are men at the end of the alleyway. No escape. HELLER drops his gun. Silence between them. He turns to look her in the eye.You know I'll find her.What we created, together.Truth is I was always very fond of you.Leave him here. And they all walk away leaving him alone in the East Berlin dirt.She must know the truth.Where would you go? MARISSA turns to ISAACS.I'm closing the CIA operation down. Heller is dead, that's all that matters to them. This we do alone.It's a very dull place Galinka. Why would you want to go there?I have some business to sort out. She looks at her and smiles a sunny, uncomplicated smile.It's very lucky we ran into each other, don't you think?You've hurt your arm.I'm Astrid.That's right. I lived there for many years. I travel a lot. MARISSA smiles at her kindly. HANNA feels safe for the first time in ages. She feels the tears come.Oh dear, what's wrong with you?It's okay. Are you in trouble? HANNA nods. She fights the tears. MARISSA gently holds her hand as she drives. HANNA weeping.What sort of trouble?Sometimes I feel the same way.Sleep why don't you? You look very tired. It will take half an hour on this road. HANNA nods. She begins to drift off, so long since she has slept. Her eyes fall shut and her head rests against the window. She is asleep. Vulnerable.Nearly there. HANNA doesn't see MARISSA'S SHOES.This is it.Yes. Just a few cottages. And the old bunker. HANNA chooses not to ask any more questions.I wish there was more I could do for you. MARISSA looks kindly at HANNA who is confused by the intimacy. MARISSA reaches into the glove compartment and retrieves a torch which she hands to HANNA.Here, take this. HANNA switches the torch on and off, thinking.I hope you find what you're looking for.Don't worry sweetie. I don't want to hurt you. MARISSA'S tone has turned into a twisted interpretation of maternal care. HANNA does not move. Like a wild animal cornered.I could have killed you already when you were asleep in the car. HANNA'S still shaking. HANNA now sees ISAACS and his HENCHMEN, three of them, all with hunting rifles. All ready to shoot her should she attack or run. They are some distance away, not coming any closer.Did Erik tell you about this place?Sleeping. They're all sleeping.I can protect you, Hanna. Make sure you walk out of here and keep walking. Grow up and grow old in safety and security. No one need know a thing. But you have to trust me. You can't talk about this with anyone. It's what we call \u00e2\u0080\u009cclassified.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If you tell anyone, it'll be dangerous for both of us. HANNA looks at her, remembering what ERIK told her, trying hard not to succumb.You're mother didn't want you, sweetie. I saved you. HANNA just stares, not believing her.I'm the only person left who understands who you are. The only one who cares. MARISSA holds out a hand to HANNA, for HANNA to take, a motherly gesture...I practically am your mother.Let me take care of you?Hanna.
