It's French Morocco.Thank you, Mr. Bernard.Why was he so angry? It was an accident.Do you live in Morocco, Mr. Bernard?Why?Do you live in France, Mr. Bernard?What business are you in, Mr. Bernard?Okay, But I'm no Scheherazade.Goodbye.The one who was shouting at Hank for taking the woman's veil. He and the Frenchman were talking like old friends.It means Mr. Bernard is a very mysterious man.What do you know about him?You see? And he knows you' re an American living in Indianapolis, Indiana. A doctor at the Good Samaritan. You have a garden with snails, a wife, a boy who can spell haemoglobin. You went to a medical convention in Paris. Stopped at Rome, Lisbon, Casablanca. You once served in North Africa with an Army field Hospital --Not talking.He was asking, you were telling. You might as well have handed him your passport.Maybe Mr. Bernard has.Oh, Ben!Bitter medicine, doctor. But I'll swallow it.Well. This eases the pain.Just an expression.We're being watched.I'm a little out of form, Hank.All right, Mr. Hammerstein. What's your pleasure?What's your key?Pretty original.Que Sera Sera, whatever will be will be The future's not ours to see Que Sera Sera What will be will be Que Sera Sera.Que Sera Sera, whatever will be will be The future's not ours to see Que Sera Sera!

I tell them tenderly:He said the manager is going to send up somebody to baby sit.Thank you.Thank you. Let's sit where it's cool.Yes, I was on the American stage, and the London stage, and even the Paris stage.I thought you might have seen me in Paris -- being French, and --Have you ever been to Paris, Mr. Bernard?What?Just what are you buying, or selling, now in Marrakesh?I'll answer it.I'll do it, Hank.Ben...You're right. People are staring at us.They stared at us when we went into the hotel.Yes, I am.Thank you, Mr. Drayton.Possibly never again, professionally.Temporarily.What Ben means is that there are no Broadway musical shows produced in Indianapolis, Indiana. Of course, if we lived in New York... ...where I hear doctors aren't starving...Not the least, Mrs. Drayton.Does it have something to do with religion?Well just what do you think of that? First he promises to take us to dinner --Oh, Ben! What's the matter with you?!I just don't like to be both privately and publicly insulted.We're not an old married couple! All right -- He's a heel. I don't understand him -- and I'm beginning not to like what he's doing to our whole night.Ben, I know you -- once you get worked up, you'll start a fight. Now please, sit down and forget him.Louis Bernard, the big buyer from Paris, was going to take us through the market tomorrow.Ben, don't. Our dinner's getting cold. We'd love to go with you.I don't know why Ben gets so worked up over unimportant things.Oh, all that talk last night was just social chit chat, Every woman who ever gave up the stage for marriage is supposed to want to go back. I was just playing a part expected of me.No, if at all, let's talk about it humorously.Ben, this whole market place is very different and exciting.I was just thinking...do you know what's paying for these three days in Marrakesh?And the purse I bought in Paris...Any time he starts wearing you out...Ben, glamour is a costume I put on once. It never fit too well. I'd rather live my own life than one written for me.Ben, you're setting a trap for me.You mean give him a change to be a doctor?All right, darling, a deal's a deal.For every time step he'll learn a new muscle -- and for every chorus, three bones.Two chapters of Grey's Anatomy.I'd like to say something where nobody can hear us.When are we going to have another child?You're the doctor. You have all the answers.Having a good time, Hank?Hank!Ben -- who is he?Is he dead?Of course we know him! It's the frenchman, Louis Bernard.You're very thoughtful.Why should he suddenly turn up in Arab- outfit, wearing makeup?I'll bet he was a spy, or something like that.Ben, what did he whisper to you? What did you write down?What is it?I have to stretch.But at different tables.I don't know a thing,Who was it, Ben?That was nice of him.Ben...Let me see the message.I'm your wife, Ben -- not the police inspector. Let's see it.But Ben, a man's life --Hank, seeing a man killed in front of him. What a shook it must be to his mind.Why don't you just give that note to the American Consulate -- Why get any more involved?What about him?Okay.Ben, What's holding you up?Frankly, I'm exhausted. Don't you feel well?I'll call Mrs. Drayton and tell her we're back. She can bring Hank up here, or I'll go get his.Why?Ben...we're about to have our monthly fight.Then stop playing Rasputin. I only said I was going to call Mrs. Drayton.I'm so relaxed I'm tired. You take them.Ben...Six months ago you told me I took too many pills!I have not.I'm listening.What could it be?All right, Doctor McKenna. I am now relaxed and listening.Why don't I call Mrs. Drayton first. You can tell me while she's bringing Hank up.See.I know all that. Get to the surprise.Nothing suspicious about us.And he was killed before he found them.You'll be telling me next it was Mr. and Mrs. Drayton!If that's a joke, I don't think it's a very funny one.Think I'll lie down.Hank? Why H... ?Mrs. Drayton took Hank back to the hotel. She is downstairs!Well let's start looking for him. Mr. Drayton...Mr. Drayton should...Ben!! I could kill you! Sedative!All this time you, knew Hank was gone, and you wouldn't tell me.He's my child more than yours! I had him.Let go of me! I'll never never never forget this! We've got to find Hank! We've got to find him.You think you're the only one strong enough to take anything? Ben, Ben, I hate you, with my whole heart. Hank! Where is Hank? Hank, oh Hank! Get him, Ben. Please. You damn miserable human...how could anybody...do...Oh Ben, Ben, Ben...where is he? Where is he?How could they remember me so well, Ben? It's been four years since I played London.But how did they know...who could have told them...Ben, you didn't...?Do you know where he is?Mr. Buchanan --They told us not to say anything!And when they've done what they're going to do, they'll let him go. So all we have to do is wait.Ben, what can we do by ourselves? We need --Ben -- maybe they could find those people, and Hank, before --You act as if you're the only one who's concerned about Hank.Hallo.Yes.Mrs...Drayton?Where's Hank? Where have you got him?Where is he? Where have you got him?Yes. Please, please!Hello. Hello, Hank?Oh, Hank, Hank darling, are you really all right?He was scared.It's from the Panell's. \"Welcome home, Jo. Look forward to seeing your family. Especially the little--\"Cindy and Jan. You don't know Cindy and Jan.What are you looking for?I can't make up my mind, Ben. I'm jut scared to death. I'm afraid we'll do the wrong thing.What are you going to say?I go.Sightseeing.Hello, Val. Jo and I want to thank all of you for the lovely flowers. But you shouldn't have. We might not be here long!I'd like everyone to meet my husband.And this one is Jan Peterson who sing almost as well as I do, but can handle those legs like Nijinsky.And Cindy Fontaine, the most wonderful expatriate I've ever known.Hank. Henry, really.Thank you again for the beautiful flowers.Oh, Val -- I wish I could, but...Ben!Ben, for the last time, please let me go.Huh?No. No...you mean Chappell!It's not a man, it's a place! Ambrose Chapel! Ambrose Chapel! It has to be!I'm very sorry.But have another drink -- and please explain to Ben when he comes in.Ben -- Ben, darling...what happened -- did you find anything?Then it must be the chapel - and I've found it, Ben. It's just a short way from here. It was a crazy thing to do --I'll meet you outside.There it is.Ben, should we get some help from the police?Let's wait and look around...What if he asks me...Ben, I don't want to leave you....And Ben is in there now, watching the both of them!I don't know, I don't know where he is...but at least these people will know -- the Draytons. If you'd only send somebody to get them.Well call him there, please! Call him!Then can't you do anything -- right away -- before we lose the Draytons?We don't have days to do this. It's a matter of minutes. Can't you send the police. Or do I have to go to the Albert Hall myself.There's nobody there!Yes, but something's wrong. A few minutes ago the place was full of people, and now there's nobody!My husband's in there. There must have been thirty or forty people... and now...It couldn't...it couldn't have been more than five minutes ago!I told Mr. Woburn he had to hurry.I tried that. It's looked, Let's force it open.Couldn't you get one?Of course I'm certain. I was there myself, sitting next to my husband. He sent me out to call Scotland Yard.You're not leaving?Yes, I want to go to Albert Hall.All right. Let's go.I would like to see the manager, please.Please, I must speak to one of them. Which are they?If you don't mind, I'm just looking for someone.It wasn't -- it wasn't --Where's our boy? Where's Hank?Yes, Mr. Buchanan. We still need it.How do you know?What are you thinking about, Ben?What am I supposed to say, Ben? I don't know -- Ben, half looking at Woburn and Buchanan, gives her instructions.He said -- all right.Yes. I'm Jo Conway.Well, I don't know. It's been some time...All right.

Hank -- come back here!Louis Bernard. Got something to write on?Yes. Yes. He's dead.Do we have to?What's more important -- why was he killed?I'll tell you later.I don't feel very good after what I said about Louis Bernard last night.I didn't know him at all.

A tourist, and an American citizen.I didn't have.A medical convention.I met him yesterday -- on the bus -- for the first time in my life.I know nothing about Louis Bernard.What's that?Now, look here...Boy, you not only ask the questions you also answer them -- Wait a minute let me ask you a question.Assuming Bernard trusted me as implicitly as you say, I would never reveal anything he said to me, would I?Let's get something straight. I'm a tourist traveling for pleasure. I somehow got involved in an unfortunate incident. I came down here to make a simple statement of fact, and not to be subjected to a police grilling.Now hold your horses! Just hold them.Wait a minute. A telephone call for me?Where?I'll take the call now. You just take it easy.Hello.This is McKenna. Who's calling me?Hello.Drayton!Didn't your wife say she was taking Hank straight back to the hotel?Call her. Somebody just threatened me about Hank. See if he's all right.Four fourteen.She didn't come back?Look -- you get back to the hotel right away -- and see if you can find out what's going on.I'll finish up with the police and join you as soon as I can.Just don't waste any time!It was the Concierge at the Hotel. He heard we were being held by the Police and thought there was some way he could help us.I told him if we weren't back there in fifteen minutes to call the American Consulate in Casablanca.Let's go, Jo.If it doesn't take too long.I don't -- I don't think you should.Because I didn't want to....is at stake, I know, But I'm not sure of what's the right thing to do.Maybe.I know.Jo...about Hank...Well...he...he's the kind of a kid who can take of himself.You get the key. I'll take care of the driver.Uh...pardon me.Do you know Mrs. Drayton?Did you see her come back from the market place anytime in the past hour or so?Wait a minute. You don't understand... she had a small boy with her. Mine.How about Mister Drayton?He what?He couldn't have.No, Mr. Drayton, the Englishman with horn-rimmed glasses.Jo, hold the call for a minute.Because I asked you to.I hope we don't.Wait 'til I come back.Something to relax you.Jo, they're for you. I'm the doctor.You know how you get when things happen -- tense and upset. Now do me a favor.Six months ago you weren't a witness to a murder. You've been excited, fatigued -- talking a blue streak and going around in circles.Jo, I make my living knowing when and how to administer medicine. You'll feel a lot better tomorrow if you take these today. But you don't think so. Okay, I'll make a deal with you.There's something about Louis Bernard, the police station, and this whole spy business that I haven't told you yet.This is the price of curiosity.There's one way to find out.Just a minute. This whole thing strange right from the very beginning.It was no accident that Louis Bernard helped us out on the bus, and struck up a conversation. You were right about him.Yes...yes, you were right about him. He was...was strange.He got talking to us because he was on the lookout for a suspicious married couple.He was wrong. It was a different married couple.No. He found them. In the restaurant. Last night. That's why he was killed.That's just who it was, Jo.Listen to me. And listen carefully.That phone call I received at the police station.It wasn't from the concierge at the hotel. It was from somebody with a foreign voice who said if I told anybody one word of what. Louis Bernard whispered to me in the market place that something...something might happen to...to, to Hank.They've taken him away.Mrs. Drayton has vanished! She never came back here! And Hank didn't either!Jo, Mr. Drayton, checked out of the hotel thirty or forty minutes ago!I wasn't sure, until now.Darling, if somebody did this to me, I'd say just what you said.There's still no news of him, Jo.Both the Draytons are definitely gone. The hotel register says they come from London. Drayton told the concierge he was a college professor. The only thing to do now is to get out of Marrakesh.As individuals we're helpless here. And because of that phone call, we can't bring the police in on it. I even thought of taking that chance.But connect Hank's disappearance to Louis Bernard's murder. And the first thing they'd do would be to make me tell them Louis Bernard's message. That...that could be, Hank's...well, it wouldn't help him.We're going to London.I found out. The Draytons had a private plane -- that's how they took Hank back. It could lend anywhere -- no question of a passport or anything.So we're going to London to find him.A Man...a statesman...is to be killed... assassinated ... in London...soon...very soon...tell them...in London...to try Ambrose Chappell... We're going to try this Ambrose Chappell and if he has anything at all to do with this, I'm going to offer him every cent I've got to got Hank back. This Ambrose Chappell guy is our only hope. Understand, Jo?We've only got a few hours, Jo! We have to got up and start moving.I've paid the bill, and there's a car waiting downstairs. As soon as I pack, we're leaving.I guess you're the kind of girl they don't forget.All I did was wire Val and Helen Parnell to get us rooms --But I didn't count on this --Yes? What is it?Whatever you say.Now what do you people want with us?Who is Mr. Buchanan?Why does Scotland Yard want to talk with us?What about Hank? What have you heard?I think they took him for money.Jo...That might be true, but --Now, don't try to frighten us, Mr. Buchanan.You worked on the wrong McKenna, Mr. Buchanan. Louis Bernard talked to me, not my wife.Bernard spoke in French, and I don't understand a word of the language.Maybe. Maybe isn't good enough for me, and it shouldn't be good enough for you.Now Jo, I didn't mean it that way. We made up our minds what we were going to do -- now let's try to stick to it.We'd like to cooperate with you, Mr. Buchanan -- but -- but we just can't.Well, maybe if we --Hank. This is daddy.Where are you, Hank? Where are you?Hank, where are you? For Heaven's sake, where are you?!!Do I have to say any more?It's fine. Just fine.Oh yes. Thank you.You'd better keep your book.The only clue we have which might lead us to Hank. The place and identity of Mr. Ambrose Chappell.There it is -- big as life -- Ambrose Chappell.Ambrose Chappell - Sixty-one Burdett Street. Camden Town. Telephone - Gulliver 6198.Don't you want me to call him?I'll try not to be too wrong.I'll offer to keep my mouth shut and give him all the money we have -- for Hank. Operator. Get me ... Gulliver 6198. Thank you.Hello, hello? Is this Ambrose Chappell? Mr. Ambrose Chappell? All right...I will...IIt's only business. It's nothing.Hello? Mr. Ambrose Chappell? I said is this Ambrose Chappell? ...Well this Mr. McKenna. Uh,...Doctor Benjamin McKenna.Well, uh, uh .. are you going to be at your address for a while? Uh huh, it's just some business. Nothing big. Uh huh, well thank you. I'll drop around.I can believe it. How do you do, Jan.Haven't you been home recently?He -- he's staying with some other people -- so we can have a little time to ourselves.I'm taking orders for drinks.Room service, please.Will you order the stuff?I'll be back in a little while.Thank you, but I'll catch up when I get back.It has to be done, Jo.You can't. I won't disappear. Promise.Two people are much easier to follow than one. We don't want Buchanan's men on our tracks. Or the other people, either. I'm going out by the service entrance --I...I'd like to speak to Mr. Ambrose Chappell, please.Well you see, I uh...Oh, of course, McKenna. Doctor Benjamin McKenna, I called you.You are Ambrose Chappell?You do?I'm Doctor Mckenna. Does the name mean anything to you?You have no idea why I came here?I was given your name by someone I happened to meet in Marrakesh.I suppose you've heard of him. Louis Bernard. A Frenchman.Let's stop fencing with words, huh? Bernard told me to come here, just before he died.You know it as well as I do. Now I came to make a business proposition. And I don't see how you can turn it down.You want to talk here?Okay. First of all, I haven't uttered one word of what Bernard told to before he died. And I won't. Frankly I'm not interested in political intrigue, and I don't care who it is you're going to kill here in London. All I want is that boy, and I'll get on the first plane for America.Now that isn't all. If money will do anything...You told him to call the police. Now don't try to bluff me like that!You don't know Louis Bernard?And you don't have any idea what went on in Marrakesh yesterday, or where my boy is?Now just a minute. Take it easy. I obviously got the wrong place. Now stay away from me.Where's Jo?But -- but, that's where I've been...Where is it! What's the address?Jo?No -- I drew a complete blank.I have the address, Jo. Now stay there until I get there...and don't do anything!Will you stick around? We'll be back as soon as we can. I don't know how to thank you.You may have just hit it right on the nose. You can't be farther wrong than I was with my Ambrose Chapel. Let's go.No, honey, please, no -- let's take a crack at this alone.This looks like mother wild goose chase.Look who's coming down the aisle.That's Buchanan's phone number. Go on out and call him and ask him to surround the place with police.Tell him...tell him everything. This is the time. I'm sure Hank is around here some place.I don't know how else to do it, honey.Where's my boy, Drayton?What do you want? I'll give you money and keep my mouth shut. All I want is my boy.Tell me what you want. I'll do anything.Hank! Hank McKenna! Hank! Where are you? Hank! Hank!Then he didn't kill him?Don't be a fool.Too bad you didn't contact your assistant. He sent us both here.You see, we finally needed that help you offered. We still need it....recognized him, and he recognized me. So he jumped for it. And that is all.If the Draytons are at the Embassy, Hank has to be there too!Why can't you?What does that mean in common language?Does that mean they can steal children and get away with it?What's the telephone number of this Embassy.Grosvenor 0144.I'm going to speak to the Minister himself.May I speak to the Prime Minister, please?Tell him the lady who saved his life wants to speak to him. Its important.I'm sure she would be glad to... wouldn't you dear?No...I'll just stand over here.I don't think you want to start any shooting, Drayton -- with all those people downstairs, and police outside.Don't ask me for help, you miserable....There won't be. Hank -- don't say or do anything.I'm sorry we were gone so long, Val, but we had to go and pick up Hank.", "clean_line": "hank northern africa miles north sahara desert wait till marrakesh bet wait

Jevous prend.How do you do, sir!My wife tells me Mrs. McKenna appeared at the London Palladium a few years ago.And I must admit I love 'em. I'm not one for this terrible Bee Bop or whatever you call it.Only the first two fingers and thumb of the right hand. Never use the smaller fingers. And always keep the left hand in the lap.More social than religious, I'd say.Well, as I was saying, I was quite happy farming my bit of land It Buckinghamshire, when these chaps from the United Nations started worrying me.So, I pulled myself up by the roots, and here we are. United Nations Relief.You should see my report on soil erosion in Morocco... But nobody reads it.By the way, it'd be pleasant if you'd let us show you round the market place, tomorrow.How are the acrobats today?Il ne parle pas francais. Je traduir\u00e1i.He wants to find out if you know this man.McKenna.Just as I thought. He wants both of you to go to police headquarters to make a statement.I'm afraid so. Our friends here have to go to the police Station. I'm going with them to give what help I can.I think we'd better set off. Heaven knows how long we shall be.Once we talk to the police inspector, I'll do my best to out some of the red tape.I'm afraid the questions will go on till doomsday, if you admit knew this chap Bernard before.They're a cynical lot, these French -- they might refuse to believe that.It might sound a bit odd, from their point of view. They saw the poor chap whispering to you ... and then they saw you writing something down...The question is, are you going to show them what you wrote down?Ces personnes sont mes bons amis, les McKenna. Mon nom est Drayton. Ils ne parlent pas francais et ils m'ont demand\u00e9 de traduire.As I recall. Why?Passez moi l'h\u00f4tel Mamounia, s'il vous plait. Voulez vous appeler la chambre deux cents dix sept s'il vous plait.... je vois, Puis-je parler au, concierge?...Ah! ici Mr. Drayton de la chambre deux cents dix sept. Est ce que ma femme est revenue a l'h\u00f4tel depuis une heure? Sa chambre ne r\u00e9pond pas.... je vois... bien... bien... merci... Oh! Un instant s'il vous plait.Voulez vous essayer la chambre quatre cents quatorze?...Merci.I can't believe it.At least nobody's seen her. What on earth...It's so unlike my wife...Right. But don't worry. Probably some stupid misunderstanding. If I find out anything before you get back, I'll ring you here.That's not a very orthodox sentiment.Two excellent tickets for the concert at the Albert Hall -- with my compliments.Your box is nicely placed, or shall we say strategically placed.Now for the most important part.A record of the delightful Picco they will play tonight.Music is less in your line than marksmanship. If you will listen, my friend, I will play for you the exact moment at which you can shoot. Now listen carefully.Let me do it for you again. Now listen for the cymbal crash.You see at such a moment your shot will not be heard. The listeners will not even be disturbed. I think the composer would have appreciated that. No one will know.Ah, yes -- if you are clever, my friend. Any questions musical or otherwise?There's's one comforting thought. It happens early in the evening. I hope I won't upset you if I say there's time for one shot only. If you need another, the risk is yours.That's a comfort -- traipsing all the way down to Marrakesh to fetch you I should like you to do me credit.Your distinguished target's on the way there now. A car is waiting for you downstairs at the back entrance. You will pick up a Miss Benson on your way. She will be your companion in the box. She's there to lend an air of respectability...if that's possible.I think you can trust me.I think you had better be going. It is impolite to be late for a concert. It would be awkward if they made you wait until the first selection is over.See him downstairs, my dear. I'm sorry you must sneak out the back way, but we have to preserve our respectable front.Brothers and Sisters: The subject of my address this evening is adversity. The average life, yours and mine, is often harassed and perplexed by cruelties and disappointments beyond our control.Few of us pause to think how life's adversities work in our behalf, to make better men and women of us.But I believe we should pause now to do a little stock-taking -- to look into our own hearts and see what we find there. Therefore instead of continuing the service, I think we should all return to our homes for private meditation, remembering how little we have to complain of and how much to be grateful for. Next week I shall discuss the fruits of our meditation. Until then, my blessing upon each and every one of you.Well this is a pleasant surprise, Doctor.He's upstairs. As a matter of fact you've just come in time to help my wife with Hank's food. Seems Hank doesn't care much for English cooking.And what about your wife? Did she go outside just to get some fresh air.All right -- you'll see your boy in good time.Excuse me sir, I have a lot to explain to you -- something very unusual has happened. I must also have the money to pay our French marksman.I don't see how you can hold me responsible. He was most warmly recommended by our people in Marrakesh...I don't know what to say ...How else could I make sure the American would hold his tongue?I didn't think...I only thought...There's no difficulty about that, surely? The car --I'll think of some method. Just give me time....Right, I'll see to it..You two wait in the mail room. I'll bring him down.I won't be a minute.Precisely my own notion, my dear.I'm sure you'll ba sensible, and help me out of here?You wouldn't want your father to get hurt, would you?We'll go down the stairs together in a casual sort of way. Then we'll stroll along to the nearest taxi rank. I trust there won't be any emotional outbursts...Shall we go?", "clean_line": "est ce que vous etes libre jevous prend sir wife tells mrs mckenna appeared london palladium years ago admit love em terrible bee bop fingers thumb right hand use smaller fingers left hand lap social religious saying happy farming bit land buckinghamshire chaps united nations started worrying pulled roots united nations relief report soil erosion morocco reads way pleasant let round market place tomorrow acrobats today il ne parle pas francais je traduir\u00e1i wants know man mckenna thought wants police headquarters statement afraid friends police station going help think better set heaven knows long shall talk police inspector ll best red tape afraid questions till doomsday admit knew chap bernard cynical lot french refuse believe sound bit odd point view saw poor chap whispering saw writing question going wrote ces personnes sont mes bons amis les mckenna mon nom est drayton ils ne parlent pas francais et ils ont demand\u00e9 traduire recall passez moi h\u00f4tel mamounia il vous plait voulez vous appeler la chambre deux cents dix sept il vous plait je vois puis je parler au concierge ah ici mr drayton la chambre deux cents dix sept est ce que ma femme est revenue h\u00f4tel depuis une heure sa chambre ne r\u00e9pond pas je vois bien bien merci oh instant il vous plait voulez vous essayer la chambre quatre cents quatorze merci believe seen earth unlike wife right worry probably stupid misunderstanding ll ring orthodox sentiment excellent tickets concert albert hall compliments box nicely placed shall strategically placed important record delightful picco play tonight music line marksmanship listen friend play exact moment shoot listen carefully let listen cymbal crash moment shot heard listeners disturbed think composer appreciated know ah yes clever friend questions musical comforting thought happens early evening hope won upset time shot need risk comfort traipsing way marrakesh fetch like credit distinguished target way car waiting downstairs entrance pick miss benson way companion box lend air respectability possible think trust think better going impolite late concert awkward wait selection downstairs dear sorry sneak way preserve respectable brothers sisters subject address evening adversity average life harassed perplexed cruelties disappointments control pause think life adversities work behalf better men women believe pause little stock taking look hearts instead continuing service think return homes private meditation remembering little complain grateful week shall discuss fruits meditation blessing pleasant surprise doctor upstairs matter fact ve come time help wife hank food hank care english cooking wife outside fresh air right ll boy good time excuse sir lot explain unusual happened money pay french marksman hold responsible warmly recommended people marrakesh know sure american hold tongue think thought difficulty surely car ll think method time right ll wait mail room ll bring won minute precisely notion dear sure ll ba sensible help wouldn want father hurt ll stairs casual sort way ll stroll nearest taxi rank trust won emotional outbursts shall"}}}
