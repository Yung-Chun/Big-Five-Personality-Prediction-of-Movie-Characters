She is not above flirting with him when it suits her ends.How do you both?On my word, the father's son! He and Volumnia laugh. Menenius has sensed Virgilia's tension. Tries to cheer her:Come, I must have you play the idle housewife with me this afternoon.Not out of doors!Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably.Go with me and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband.There came news from him last night.

The saturnine Sicinius' response seems almost a threat:I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying water in it; one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning. What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.You know neither me, yourselves nor anything You are ambitious. A tense beat. They are formidable adversaries.Good-e'en to your worships.

The Tribunes watch him cut through the lunch crowd and exit.Is he not wounded? He was wont to come home wounded.So do I too -- if it be not too much. Brings a victory in his pocket, the wounds become him. Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?I'll be sworn they are true. Where is he wounded? Volumnia and Menenius now gleefully add up her son's wounds like accountants -- or campaign managers.One in the neck, and two in the thigh - there's nine that I know.Now it's twenty-seven. Every gash was an enemy's grave. We focus on Volumnia's face as she thinks about her son.Now, the gods crown thee!A hundred thousand welcomes! Coriolanus is surrounded by well-wishers and political admirers. Volumnia and Menenius usher him along. We see the image from TV: The noble warrior returned home. Devoted family. Flags waving. The future golden.It remains, As the main point of this our after- meeting, To gratify his noble service that Hath thus stood for his country... The interior of the grand Senate is an airy, sweeping chamber that suggests the Israeli Knesset or U.N. General Assembly. Again, classical symmetry is the rule with tiers of seats facing a central dais. An imposing piece of outdated modern art suggesting the might of Rome looms over the chamber like a bird of prey. Network TV cameras purr quietly from a corner. Menenius, Cominius, Coriolanus and several other politicos are seating at a central table on the dais, facing the rows of SENATORS. Menenius is standing at a podium, speaking into a microphone:Therefore, please you, Most reverend and grave elders, to desire The present Consul, and last general In our well-found successes, to report A little of that worthy work performed By Caius Martius Coriolanus.Nay, keep your place.Pray now, sit down.The Senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased To make thee Consul! Menenius steps back. A beat. Coriolanus stares at the Senators. At the TV cameras. He leans awkwardly into the podium microphone:It then remains That you do speak to the people.Pray you, go fit you to the custom.To our noble Consul Wish we all joy and honor! He applauds. The applause is taken up by the Senators. Some cheering as well for the hero of Rome The two Tribunes, however, are already whispering maliciously to other Senators. Menenius seems pleased with the general response. So far, so good.Have you not known The worthiest men have done it?O me, the gods! You must not speak like that. You mustYou'll mar all! The limo stops. They are at the marketplace. The moment has come. Menenius takes a breath. Urges calm:Pray you, speak to them, I pray you, In wholesome manner.You have stood your limitation, and theI'll keep you company.The matter?Be calm, be calm.Let's be calm--Not now, not now--Well, no more!Come, enough!On both sides more respect!Go, get you to your house! Be gone, away! All will be naught else--The Consul Coriolanus.0, he's a limb that has but a disease: Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy. What has he done to Rome that's worth his death? Eh? Killing our enemies?! He sees that his words are having some effect, he presses theThe blood he hath lost -- He dropped it for his country. Some in the room murmur agreement.Consider this: he has been bred in theI'll bring him to you. He goes quickly. Brutus turns to Sicinius and Tamora and begins to quietly explain his plan.Well said, noble woman!Return to the Tribunes.Repent what you have spoke.This but done, even as she speaks, Why their hearts were yours.Only fair speech.Ay, but mildly.Calmly, I do beseech you. Coriolanus steps to the microphone. Brutus gestures for the crowd to quiet down. We see bits of this scene through the monitors on the TV cameras. When the crowd is silent, Coriolanus begins to make aA noble wish. His boilerplate speech over, Coriolanus turns to Sicinius who is at the other standing microphone:Lo, citizens, he says he is content. The warlike service he has done,Consider further, That when he speaks not like a citizen, You find him like a soldier. Do not take His rougher accents for malicious sounds, But, as I say, such as become a soldier. Coriolanus cuts in, his impatience getting the better of him:Come, come, peace...You have told them home; And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me? She turns to him. A cold and killing fire in her eyes.Hail to you both.All's well, and might have been muchNay, I hear nothing. His mother and hisI think not so.'Tis Aufidius, Who, hearing of our Martius' banishment, Thrusts forth his horns again into the world.No, I'll not go!Go, you that banished him! A mile before his tent fall down, andNo, I'll not meddle.What should I do? Brutus stops him, with real emotion:Well, and say that Martius Return me, as Titus is returned, Unheard - what then?I'll undertake it I think he'll hear me. The Tribunes are relieved. Cominius nods and escorts Menenius out. Brutus and Sicinius return to Titus.The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than thy old friend Menenius does! 0 Martius, Martius! He steps forward to hug Coriolanus. Two of the Acolytes stop him. He can approach no further. Menenius accepts this. No matter. He is completely confident he will be able to manipulate his protege. He always has in the past.Thou art preparing fire for us. Look thee, here's water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to thee, but being assured none but myself could move thee, I have been blown out of your gates with sighs, and conjure thee to pardon Rome.How? . Away?This Martius is grown from man to dragon. He has wings; he's more than a creeping thing. He stops at his limo.There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger.

Nor sleep, nor sanctuary, being naked, Sick, the prayers of priests, Nor times of sacrifice, Shall lift up their rotten privilege And custom, Against my hate to Martius. In the shattered glass of the minivan window, Aufidius suddenly sees himself. He studies his own face, nurturing his dark thoughts.Where I find him, were it At home, upon my brother's guard, even there, Will I wash my fierce hand in his heart.Whence comes thou? What wouldst thou? Thy name? Coriolanus does not respond.Speak, man! What's thy name?Say, what's thy name? Thou has a grim appearance .What's thy name?I know thee not Thy name? Finally, Coriolanus removes his burnoose. His face is exposed. The Volscians are stunned.O Martius Martius Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart A root of ancient envy. He offers his hand. Coriolanus takes it. Aufidius continues to hold him by the hand, rather intensely, speaking low:Let me twine Mine arms about that body. He embraces Coriolanus. Aufidius' men finally relax. Weapons are lowered. Relieved glances exchanged. Some of the Volscians, though, are clearly suspicious of Coriolanus. They watch Aufidius and Coriolanus, concerned. Aufidius still can't quite believe his ancient enemy is now his newest ally.Why, thou Mars, I tell thee, We have a power on foot, and I hadOr lose mine arm for it.

They tell the story of Martius' life: the happy baby; the stern dead father; the rigid young military cadet; the formal wedding; the restrained and unsmiling adult. In the photos we sense a transformation: innocent boy to experienced, severe looking soldier.

Cominius enters with several other political supporters.He must -- and will.At thy choice, then! To beg of thee, it is my more dishonor Than thou of them. Come all to ruin! Let Thy mother rather feel thy pride thanDo your will. Then she kisses him. And she goes. Like a queen. Volumnia triumphant. Always. Then a shocking hard cut to:Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome, And occupations perish!0, you're well met. The hoarded plague ofWill you be gone?Ay, fool, is that a shame? Note but this,More noble blows than ever thou wise words, And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what -Bastards and all. Menenius has entered the bar, seeing the trouble he goes to them, tries to calm Volumnia:Now, pray, sir, get you gone. You have done a brave deed. Ere you go,This lady's husband here, this, do you see?!-- Whom you have banished, does exceed you all.I would the gods had nothing else to do But to confirm my curses! Menenius gently restrains Volumnia and the Tribunes finally escape the bar. Volumnia takes a breath, controls herself.Could I meet 'em But once a day, it would unclog my heart Of what lies heavy to it.Anger's my meat. I sup upon myself, And so shall starve with feeding. She takes Virgilia's hand and drags her out. Menenius watches. Saddened. Once proud Volumnia, reduced to this.0, stand up blest. He rises.Then with no softer cushion than theThou art my warrior; I hope to frame thee. She indicates Young Martius:This is a poor epitome of yours, Which by the interpretation of full time May show like all yourself.Your knee, sir. She pulls Virgilia down:Even he, your wife, and myself, Are suitors to you.0, no more, no more! You have said you will not grant us anything, For we have nothing else to ask but that Which you deny already; yet we will ask, That, if you fail in our request, theShould we be silent and not speak, ourFor myself, son, I propose not to wait on fortune till These wars determine. If I cannotNay, go not from us thus! Her command stops him. She appeals, quickly getting to the point of her argument:If it were so that our request did tend To save the Romans, thereby to destroy The Volsces whom you serve, you mightMay say \"This mercy we have showed,\" the Romans, \"This we received,\" and each in eitherSpeak to me, son... Still he does not respond. His emotions are roiling. Still she is soft and vulnerable...Why dost not speak? But softness is not a note she plays naturally. She knows it. Her natural aggressiveness comes out, anger and outrage gradually boiling to the surface:Thinks thou it honorable for a noble man Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you. He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy. Perhaps thy childishness will move himThou hast never in thy life Showed thy dear mother any courtesy, When she, poor hen, Has clucked thee to the wars and safelyplague thee, That thou restrains from me the dutyDown! Let us shame him with our knees! She claws at the dirt -- like Hecuba -- keening -- a shocking explosion of raw emotion -- almost an incantation:Down! An end! This is the last. So we will home to Rome, And die among our neighbors. Nay, behold! This boy, that cannot tell what he wouldCome, let us go. She rises slowly, her age showing. Her spirit broken. Or seeming so. She stares at Coriolanus as she rips off the Roman Eagle medal she wears and flings it to the ground. The blood red sky of sunset behind her reflects her passion as she summons up all her strength for a lacerating and icyThis fellow had a Volscian to his mother; His wife is in Corioles and his childLike him by chance Yet give us our dispatch. I am hushed until our city be afire, And then I'll speak a little. She turns and begins to go. But... We see finally Coriolanus crack. Like a great building crumbling. Like fissures cutting across marble. Emotion floods into him. He lunges forward and grabs her hand. Volumnia stops. Time stands still.

No!Here's he that would take from you all your power! The crowd reacts angrily -- surging forward against the restraint of the police. We see grim RIOT POLICE marching into position. The crowd is not intimidated, they are spoiling for a fight. The Tribunes provoke the crowd even more, escalating and building the fever:What is the city but the people?!We do here pronounce, upon the part of the people, Martius is worthy of present DEATH!

Well-rehearsed by Cassius and Tamora, many in the crowd respond with a fierce cry:He's sentenced. No more hearing.Let's not meet her. They say she's mad.

No further.Cominius, no. Coriolanus steps closer to Brutus. The mob sees him through the glass doors. The tension immediately increases.The people are incensed against him.The people cry you mocked them, and of late called them Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.You speak of the people As if you were a god to punish, not A man of their infirmity.Why, should the people give One that speaks thus their voice?Enough, with over-measure.Manifest treason!You are at point to lose your liberties! Martius would have all from you, Martius, Whom late you have named for Consul.Guards, seize him!Lay hands upon him!He Consul?!We'll hear no more--Be you then as the people's officer. Menenius and Coriolanus' supporters are relieved.If you bring not Martius, we'll proceed In our first way.Put him to choler straight. Coriolanus and his supporters move to the stage. Coriolanus glares at the Tribunes. The TV crews take up position. Menenius gestures for Coriolanus to step to the microphone, whispering to him:But since he hath Served well for Rome--I talk of that, that know it.There's no more to be said, but he isHere comes his mother.Pray, let us go. He tries to leave the bar. Volumnia stops him for final attack, something like a curse in its power:Well, well, we'll leave you.Is this Menenius?Caius Martius was A worthy officer in the war, but insolent, Overcome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,It cannot be the Volsces dare break with us.Only make trial what your love can do For Rome towards Martius.You know the very road into his kindness, And cannot lose your way.", "clean_line": "marked lip eyes good bad sir subtly polite chit chat turning pointed menenius growing sharper gloves coming sir come sir come know heard swear stand consul wouldso fall authorities end pray gods deserve loves power petty servant state enemy spake liberties enforce pride old hate unto dangerous cominius coriolanus steps closer brutus mob sees glass doors tension immediately increases people incensed people mocked late called time pleasers flatterers foes nobleness speak people god punish man infirmity people speaks voice measure manifest treason point lose liberties martius martius late named consul guards seize lay hands consul ll hear people officer menenius coriolanus supporters relieved bring martius ll proceed way choler straight coriolanus supporters stage coriolanus glares tribunes tv crews position menenius gestures coriolanus step microphone whispering hath served rome talk know said ishere comes mother pray let tries leave bar volumnia stops final attack like curse power ll leave menenius caius martius worthy officer war insolent overcome pride ambitious past thinking volsces dare break trial love rome martius know road kindness lose way"}, "CORIOLANUS": {"raw_line": "No more of this; it does offend my heart. Pray now, no more. An awkward silence. Cominius elegantly tries to covers theMy gracious silence, hail. An awkwardly tender kiss. He notes her tears. Reacts coldly.Would thou have laughed had I come coffined home, That weeps to see me triumph? Ay, my dear, Such eyes the widows in Corioles wear, And mothers that lack sons.And live you yet?The good Senators must be visited; From whom I have received not only greetings, But with them change of honors. He shifts painfully as she continues to treat one of his wounds.Know, good mother, I had rather be their servant in my way, Than sway with them in theirs. They stop when-- Virgilia enters. She stops in the doorway. It is embarrassing for her, as if she has interrupted two lovers. A long moment. She looks to her husband. To Volumnia. They stare back. There is no way she can compete with their intimacy. Surrendering, she silently goes.Your honors' pardon. I had rather have my wounds to heal again Than hear say how I got them.I had rather have one scratch my head inI do owe them still My life and services. A beat. For an acceptance speech, rather terse. Menenius jumps in to salvage the moment:I do beseech you, Let me overleap that custom, for I cannotIt is a part That I shall blush in acting, and mightTo brag unto them \"Thus I did, and thus!\" Show them the unaching scars which I should hide, As if I had received them for the hire Of their breath only! Menenius sees Coriolanus is getting angry, this could be disastrous. He elegantly gestures for Cominius to escort Coriolanus out immediately -- as he addresses the Senators and TV cameras:\"Think upon me\"? Hang 'em! I would they would forget me.Mine own desert.Ay, but not mine own desire.No, it was never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.Well then, I pray, your price of the Consulship?Kindly, sir, I pray, let me have it. I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private Your good voice, sir. What say you?A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices begged. I have your alms. Adieu. Business done, so he thinks, Coriolanus crisply moves on. Cassius is not convinced.Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be Consul.Your enigma?You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love Therefore, beseech you, I may be Consul.I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no farther.Your voices! For your voices I haveFor your voices Have done many things, some less, some more. Your voices! Indeed, I would be Consul.Worthy voices! Menenius, with Brutus and Sicinius, goes to him:Is this done?Where? At the Senate?Saw you Aufidius?Spoke he of me?How? What?At Antium lives he?I wish I had a cause to seek him there, To oppose his hatred fully. They hear the growing rumble of a crowd. Curious. They continue on and turn a corner to...Ha! What is that?What makes this change?Have I had children's voices?(glancing to the growingBut this was known before.My nobler friends, I crave their pardons. For the mutable, rank-scented crowd, Let them regard me as I do not flatter, And therein behold themselves. I say again, In soothing them, we nourish against ourWere I as patient as the midnight sleep, By Jove, it would be my mind!I'll give my reasons, More worthier than their voices! Menenius tries to pull him away, Coriolanus shakes free and continues the attack:By Jove himself, It makes the consuls base; and my soulThus we debase the nature of our seats, and make the rabble Call our cares fears; which will in time Break ope the locks of the Senate, andThou wretch, despite overwhelm thee!Hence, old goat! Coriolanus grabs Sicinius roughly and flings him aside-- At this -- the crowd ROARS in outrage -- the TV crews hustleNo, I'll die here!Let them pull all about mine ears,I talk of you! Why did you wish me milder? Would youLet go!Let them hang!What must I do?Well, what then? What then?For them? I cannot do it to the gods. Must I then do it to them?Why force you this? She pursues him:I will not do it! Lest I cease to honor mine own truth And by my body's action teach my mind A most inherent baseness. Volumnia snarls at him, exasperated, building to a thunder that dwarfs his:Pray, be content... Mother, I am going, chide me no more. He awaits her approval. She will not yet grant it.Look, I am going... Commend me to my wife. I'll return Consul, Or never trust to what my tongue can do In the way of flattery further. She graciously bows to him.The word is \"mildly.\" Pray you, let us go. Let them accuse me by invention, I Will answer in mine honor.Well, mildly be it then. Mildly! Coriolanus steels himself as they emerge from between the stands and head toward the set. TV news crews are waiting. Blinding lights snap on. The crowd, on seeing Coriolanus, lets out a ROAR. Deafening and savage. We see Cassius and Tamora moving through the crowd, instigating, convincing, imploring. Coriolanus ignores it all. Imperious to the end. Brutus and Sicinius wait on the set.The honored gods-- But his voice echoes badly with reverb. Menenius adjusts the microphone. Coriolanus begins again, quickly and by rote:The honored gods Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs ofShall I be charged no further than this present? Must all determine here?I am content.Scratches with briers, Scars to move laughter only.What is the matter That being passed for Consul with full voice, I am so dishonored that the very hour You take it off again?How? Traitor?!The fires in the lowest hell fold in the people! Call me their traitor, thou injurious Tribune!You?! I'll know no further. Let them pronounce death, exile, Flaying, pent to linger But with a grain a day - I would not buy Their mercy at the price of one fair word!Whose breath I hate As reek of the rotten fens, whose loves IHere remain with your uncertainty. Let every feeble rumor shake your hearts! Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes, Fan you into despair! Have the powerMaking but reservation of yourselves; Still your own foes - deliver you As most abated captives to some nation That won you without blows! A beat. The TV cameras hum. The crowd is silent. Menenius and the others watch in amazement. Coriolanus slowly takes one last, long look at the people of Rome.Despising, For you, the city, thus I turn my back. He turns and slowly walks toward one of the tunnels leading from the studio. The crowd follows every step with their eyes. He stops. Turns back. Steel.There is a world elsewhere. And he goes down the tunnel. Disappearing from view. A silent beat. Then, a chilling cry of absolutely Jacobin bloodlust from theNay, mother, Where is your ancient courage?Nay, mother, I shall be loved when I am lacked. She nods to him, she has regained her composure.Thou old and true Menenius, Thy tears are salter than a younger man's, And venomous to thine eyes.You shall hear from me still. He turns and looks to the distance. Miles and miles of wasteland and desolation.I go alone, Like to a lonely dragon. He strides off. The soldiers manning the checkpoint raise the barrier. Coriolanus walks under it. And begins walking down the long highway away from Rome. The only sound is the cold, lonely moan of the wind. We fade to...A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears, And harsh in sound to thine. The other Guard from outside, and several other soldiers, rush in. Weapons drawn, surrounding Coriolanus. He doesn't move a muscle. Aufidius, intrigued by the stranger's courage, waves his men off.Know'st thou me yet?My name is Caius Martius, who hath done To thee particularly and to all theOnly that name remains. Aufidius doesn't understand. Coriolanus explains:The cruelty and envy of the people, Who have all forsook me, hath devoured the rest, And suffered me by the voice of slaves toWhooped out of Rome. Now this extremity Hath brought me to thy hearth, not out ofI will fight Against my cankered country with theWhich not to cut would show thee but a fool, Since I have ever followed thee with hate, And cannot live but to thy shame unless It be to do thee service. A long beat. Aufidius stares at Coriolanus. The Volscians watch, eyes wide, too tense to do anything now.You bless me, gods. Then Aufidius takes him to a huge military map laid out on a pool table. Rome and her territories. Strategic markers denote Roman forces and Volscian forces.Away.Therefore be gone. His frigid eyes slice into Menenius:Another word, Menenius, I will not hear thee speak. Menenius stares at him, shaken to the core. The Guards pull Menenius away. Coriolanus doesn't even glance at him.My partner in this action, You must report to the Volscian lords howThis last old man, Whom with a cracked heart I have sent to Rome, Loved me above the measure of a father. Shouts and whistles from outside the factory draw their attention.These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.Best of my flesh, Forgive my tyranny, but do not say For that \"Forgive our Romans.\" She shows great courage. Stepping forward and kissing him deeply. A long kiss.0, a kiss Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge. It is a perverse response. In his monomaniacal imagination, his wife's kiss is obsessively equated with his revenge on Rome. He finally moves to Volumnia, simply can't resist her orbital pull.You gods I prate, And the most noble mother of the world Leave unsaluted. Sink, my knee, in the earth. He kneels before her. It is done with a sense of duty and protocol, not affection.What is this? Your knees to me? To your corrected son?The god of soldiers, Inform thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou may prove To shame invulnerable. Volumnia pulls Young Martius down:I beseech you, peace! Or, if you'd ask, remember this: Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers, orAufidius, and you Volsces, mark; forI have sat too long. He rises and turns as if to go--O mother mother... What have you done? He falls to his knees, clutching her hand.Behold, the heavens do ope, The gods look down -- and this unnaturalO my mother, mother! 0! You have won a happy victory for Rome; But for your son - believe it, 0 believe it! - Most dangerously you have with himBut let it come. He stands, regains his composure. He slowly walks to Aufidius. He leans close, speaking intimately:Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars, I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius, Were you in my stead, would you haveI dare be sworn you were. And, sir, it is no little thing to make Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir, What peace you'll make, advise me. We study Aufidius' face. He gives away nothing. Coriolanus turns back to Volumnia. Looks at her. She is victorious. The crimson sky looms over her ominously. And we go to...We have made peace With no less honor to the Volscians Than shame to the Romans.Traitor? How now?\"Martius\"?Hear'st thou, Mars?Measureless liar, thou has made my heart Too great for what contains it. \"Boy\"? 0 slave. Coriolanus' eyes miss nothing a Volscian thug shifting a bead of sweat on another one secretly reaching into his coat for a weapon. Some of the Volscian thugs are clearly nervous. Coriolanus is ready. He prepares himself mentally to die. He is acutely controlled:Cut me to pieces, Volsces. Men and lads, stain all your edges on me. It is a dare. A challenge.\"Boy\"? False hound.
