{"Godfather": {"DON CORLEONE": {"raw_line": "Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help. I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends.And what is that Bonasera?No. You ask for too much.The Court gave you justice.But your daughter is still alive.You never think to protect yourself with real friends. You think it's enough to be an American. All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship. And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.Then take the justice from the judge, the bitter with the sweet, Bonasera. But if you come to me with your friendship, your loyalty, then your enemies become my enemies, and then, believe me, they would fear you...Good. From me you'll get Justice.Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.Where's Michael?Then the picture will wait for him.Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.You want him to stay in this country.Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.Not to one of our paisans...give it to a Jew Congressman in another district. Who else is on the list for today?Is it necessary?Thank you, Luca, my most valued friend.I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.And with prison record.When did he call?On a day like this. Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now. Write that down before you forget it. The Turk will wait.What that? It sounds like Johnny.It is Johnny. He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.No. Let the people enjoy him. You see? He is a good godson.My Godson has come three thousand miles to do us honor and no one thinks to wet his throat.Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?Tell Santino to come in with us. He should hear some things.ACT LIKE A MAN! By Christ in Heaven, is it possible you turned out no better than a Hollywood finocchio.All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.You take care of your family?You look terrible. I want you to eat well, to rest. And spend time with your family. And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.Now go back to the party and leave it to me.When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?No, give him a living. But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?Genco will wait for me. Santino, tell your brothers they will come with me to the hospital to see Genco. Tell Fredo to drive the big car, and ask Johnny to come with us.All my sons. Tom, I want you to go to California tonight. Make the arrangements. But don't leave until I come back from the hospital and speak to you. Understood?Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?What was this for?And this?What miracles you do for strangers.And now, what do you choose to do?Good. When you are finished, come and talk to me. I have hopes for you.Genco, I've brought my sons to pay their respects. And look, even Johnny Fontane, all the way from Hollywood.I have no such power...but Genco, don't fear death.You blaspheme. Resign yourself.Luca, I am worried about this man Sollozzo. Find out what you can, through the Tattaglias. Let them believe you could be tempted away from the Corleone Family, if the right offer was made. Learn what he has under his fingernails...Remember my new Consigliere, a lawyer with his briefcase can steal more than a hundred men with guns.Why do you come to me? Why do I deserve your generosity?What percentages for my family?And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?So. I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection. No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?I said I would see you because I've heard you're a serious man, to be treated with respect... But I'll say no to you.I'll give you my reasons. I have many, many friends in Politics. But they wouldn't be so friendly if my business was narcotics instead of gambling. They think gambling is something like liquor, a harmless vice...and they think narcotics is dirty business.No...how a man makes his living is none of my business. But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed.No.Young people are greedy, and they have no manners. They speak when they should listen. But I have a sentimental weakness for my children, and I've spoiled them, as you see. But Signor Sollozzo, my no is final.Santino, never let anyone outside the family know what you are thinking. I think your brain is going soft from all that comedy you play with that young girl.What is this nonsense?Send Johnny my congratulations.Tell Paulie to get the car from the lot; I'll be ready to go home in a few minutes.That's the third time this month. I think maybe you'd better get a healthier bodyguard for me. Tell Tom.Merry Christmas.Fredo, Fredo!Well my friend, are you ready to do me this service?I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me. I do not want his mother to see him as he is.Give me a drop of anisette.My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight. So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.But you needed a drink first.Now you've had your drink.I want no inquiries made. No acts of vengeance. Consigliere, arrange a meeting with the heads of the five families...this war stops now.Call Bonasera...he will do me a service.I want to thank you all for coming. I consider it a service done to me personally and I am in the debt of each and every one of you. Especially those of you who have traveled from such distances as California, St. Louis, Kansas City; and New Orleans...Ah well, let's get down to business. We are all honorable men here, we don't have to give assurances as if we were lawyers. How did things ever go so far? Well, no matter. A lot of foolishness has come to pass. It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.Tattaglia has lost a son; I have lost a son. We are quits. Let there be a peace... That is all I want...My friends, I didn't refuse out of malice. You all know me. When have I ever refused an accommodation? But why, this time? Because I think this drug business will destroy us in the years to come. It's not like whiskey or gambling or even women which most people want and is forbidden them by the pezzonovante of the Church and the Government. But drugs? No. Even policemen, who help us in gambling and other things would refuse to help us in drugs. But...I am willing to do whatever all of you think is necessary.I forego my vengeance for my dead son, for the common good. But I have selfish reasons. My youngest son had to flee, accused of Sollozzo's murder, and I must now make arrangements so that he can come home with safety, cleared of all those false charges. That is my affair, and I will make those arrangements. But I am a superstitious man...and so if some unlucky accident should befall my youngest son, if some police officer should accidentally shoot him, or if he should hang himself in his cell, or if my son is struck by a bolt of lightning, then I will blame some of the people here. That, I could never forgive, but...aside from that, let me swear by the souls of my Grandchildren that I will never be the one to break the peace we have made.Mention it, don't insist. Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.Barzini.Tattaglia is a pimp. He could never have outfought Santino. But I wasn't sure until this day. No, it was Barzini all along.Be my son...This old building has seen its day. No way to do business...too small, too old.Have you thought about a wife? A family?I understand, Michael. But you must make a family, you know.Accept what's happened, Michael.No, I wanted other things for you.Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men. I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over. That was my misfortune. That was your misfortune. I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was. I had no choice.What else do you believe in?Believe in a family. Can you believe in your country? Those Pezzonovante of the State who decide what we shall do with our lives? Who declare wars they wish us to fight in to protect what they own. Do you put your fate in the hands of men whose only talent is that they tricked a bloc of people to vote for them? Michael, in five years the Corleone family can be completely legitimate. Very difficult things have to happen to make that possible. I can't do them anymore, but you can, if you choose to.Believe in a family; believe in a Code of Honor, older and higher, believe in Roots that go back thousands of years into your Race. Make a family, Michael, and protect it. These are our affairs, sono cosa nostra, Governments only protect men who have their own individual power. Be one of those men...you have the choice.My son is head of the Family now. If you have his permission, you have my good will.Do you have faith in my judgement?Then do what Michael says...I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace. He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune. Michael has all my confidence, as you do. For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.I see you have your Luca Brasi.There are men in this world who demand to be killed. They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. These people wander through the streets calling out \"Kill me, kill me.\" Luca Brasi was like that. And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...I made him my weapon. Because I was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him. I think you have done the same with this man.Barzini will move against you first.He will get in touch with you through someone you absolutely trust. That person will arrange a meeting, guarantee your safety......and at that meeting you will be assassinated.Your wife and children...you're happy with them?Good.And I...you.", "clean_line": "bonasera

early.Sandra, watch the kids. They're running wild.Buddy, this is a private party.Goddamn FBI...don't respect nothing.Okay. One minute.And Michael?It's me, Sonny.The Tattaglia family guarantees our investment?Yeah.I think so. Detective squad?Is he alive?Find out anything you can...you got a Grand coming.Theresa, let me talk to Tom. Not yet? Have him call me as soon as he gets home.They shot the old man.Honey...don't worry. Nothing else is going to happen.Yeah.Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is. Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.No, just you and Paulie.A couple of our people will come to stay here. Do whatever they say; I'm going over to the main house. If you want me, use Pop's special phone.Hello.Yeah.I'll wait.Ma? Ma, where are you.Ma, I just got a call. Pop's hurt...I don't know how bad.We don't know yet, Ma.Tessio...This is Santino Corleone. I want fifty reliable men out here.I don't want to use Clemenza's people right now. Understood?Luca.Don't worry, Theresa; they just want to give Tom the proposition, then they're going to turn him loose.I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.Good. She's been through it before. Me too. You were too young to know about it. You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.Theresa.All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?One of them fingered the old man.You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building. We got people in the phone company. Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.Until the old man tells me different.Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs. I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York. The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt. I don't care if we all go down together.I know I'm not the man he was. But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too. When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.Christ, if I could only contact Luca.The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time. What about the hit list.If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?That's easy to say; it's not your father.Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.OK, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead. But Tom, I want you to stay inside the Mall. You too, Mike, no chances. Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city. The hospital is yours; I want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day.What is it?Tessio, see what it is.Yeah. Hang around.Clemenza. You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?Okay, now you can move your men into the Mall, replace Tessio's people. Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show. That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news.OK forget it, just stay on the phone.You take care of Paulie?Where are you going?Send some bodyguards.OK, but be careful.All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes. Sit tight, and don't panic.I've got a hundred button men on the streets twenty-four hours a day. If Sollozzo shows one hair on his ass he's dead.Mikey, you look beautiful!The Turk wants to talk! The nerve of that son of a bitch! After he craps out last night he wants a meet.Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.No, no Consiglere. Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks. Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO. If not, it's all out war. We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.And when they shot me father...No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom. You just help me win. Understood?McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever. We'll wait.The kid's right.Go on Mike.You? You, the high-class college kid. You never wanted to get mixed up in the family business. Now you wanta gun down a police Captain and the Turk just because you got slapped in the face. You're taking it personal, it's just business and he's taking it personal.What are you, inspecting the barracks? You ready? Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.That could be a Tattaglia informer with the meeting place.One of Tattaglia's people?I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left. And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.Probably a year...Can you do it Mike?Yeah.It's me, Sonny.Connie, what is it?I'm goin' to have the doctor come over and take a look at you.Hey.

What's the matter with you?No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.Well it's war! We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian. Pop had Genco, who do I have?

You wouldn't like him.You really want to know?You like spaghetti?Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story.Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business. They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.My Father sent Luca Brasi after them. He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...Then the legs at the knees...Then the thighs where they joined the torso.Then Luca turned to the other man......who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated.I told you you wouldn't like him.Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.My brother, Tom Hagen.Thanks Tom.My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in. He's a good lawyer.Sure.He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.Tom said he'd take care of it.For bravery.For killing a man.I fought for my country. It was my choice.I'm going to finish school.And what do you want for Christmas?We'll have a quiet, civil ceremony at the City Hall, no big fuss, no family, just a couple of friends as witnesses.As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object. He'll be hurt, but he won't object.For dinner. Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.Operator. Get meShhh, you be the long distance operator. Here.Hello, Tom? Michael. Yeah... listen, we haven't left yet. I'm driving down to the city with Kay tomorrow morning. There's something important I want to tell the old man before Christmas. Will he be home tomorrow night?No. I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?No.I'm thinking about it.No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman.They don't say if he's dead or alive.Thanks.You heard from Tom yet?C'mon.How's Mom?I can help you out...Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.What?Clemenza? No, I don't believe it.How can you be sure?Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?Then wait, Sonny. Talk to Pop.That's not how Pop would have played it.All right, Sonny. All right.Is it like they say? Is he that good?Hello. Kay?He'll be OK.Yeah Kay, I'm here.Huh?I can't...Look. I'll see you tonight, OK?To the city.I don't need them, Sonny. I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.I don't think so. You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.I don't think so either. I better go.I want you to go back to New Hampshire...think things over.Goodbye.Hello? Hello?I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father. What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?You just stand here one minute...Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital. I came down late. There's no one here. None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one. The old man is completely unprotected.I won't panic.You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?You've read about my father in the papers. You've seen that no one's here to guard him. Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him. Believe me and help me.Hurry, into there.Who is it?Enzo, get out of here. There's going to be trouble.Go outside; stand in front...I'll be out in a minute.Pop...Pop, it's me Michael. Shhhh, don't try to speak. There are men who are coming to try to kill you. But I'm with you...I'm with you now...Get rid of those and look like you've got a gun in your pocket.Listen...What happened to the detectives who were supposed to be guarding my father?I'll stay until you put guards around my father's room.How much is the Turk paying you to set my father up, Captain?Christ, Sonny really means business.Cut it out.We can't wait. No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop. You have to get Sollozzo now.Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey. We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo. Set up the meeting for two days from now. Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour. So I'll feel safe. They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me. Then I'll kill them both.Sonny, it's all personal, and I learned it from him, the old man, the Godfather. He took my joining the Marines personal. I take Sollozzo trying to kill my father personal, and you know I'll kill them Sonny.How bad will it be?Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.A million times.O.K. How long do you think before I can come back?I want to settle things tonight. I want my father left alone.We're going to New Jersey?Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?Now I can talk. I feel much better.Don Tommassino.Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.I know.Corleone.I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.Don Tommassino...I should see this place.No...I would like to walk to Corleone.How do you know I come from America?Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.Yes.Shhhhh.What are you talking about?She wore a red dress, and a red ribbon in her hair. She looks more Greek than Italian. Do you know a beauty like that?Innkeeper. More wine!Tell him to come to me.I understand I've offended you by talking about your daughter. I offer you my apologies, I'm a stranger in this country, I don't know the customs very well. Let me say this, I meant no disrespect to you or her...I am an American hiding in Sicily from the police of my country. My name is Michael. You can inform the police and make your fortune but then your daughter would lose a father rather than gain a husband. In any case, I want to meet your daughter. With your permission and under the supervision of your family. With all decorum. With all respect. I am an honorable man.When the proper time comes, I'll tell you everything that a wife's father should know.Your daughter's name?It's safer to teach you English.Ciao, Don Tommassino.Things went badly in Palermo?Is that why there are more men on the walls?What is it?Get the car. I'll be leaving in ten minutes. Where's Calo?No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks...No, I'll get it. Where's Appolonia?Tell Fabrizzio and wait for me in the car.Where the hell is he going?No. No!Fabrizzio. Let your shepherds know that the one who gives me Fabrizzio will own the finest pastures in Sicily.No.I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice. From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.You wanted me to be your son.Then why have I become a man like you?A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?You look good, too.No.Come here a minute, Fredo.Who are those girls?Give them some money and send them home.Get rid of them...Johnny, the Corleone family is thinking of selling out all our interests in the Olive Oil business and settling here. Moe Greene will sell us his interest so it can be wholly owned by friends of the family.I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.Johnny, the Don wants you to help us get started. We figure entertainment will be the big factor in drawing gamblers. We hope you'll sign a contract to appear five times a year for maybe a week long engagement. We hope your friends in the movies will do the same. We count on you to convince them.Thanks.Is my credit good enough to buy you out?The hotel, the casino. The Corleone family wants to buy you out.Your casino loses money. Maybe we can do better.You're unlucky.You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino. You and the Corleone family are evened out. This is for business; name your price.Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?You straightened my brother out?I have to go back to New York tomorrow. Think of your price.The Don has semi-retired. I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.Freddie, you're my older brother. I love you. But don't ever take sides with anybody against the Family again.I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall.We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.No, you eat...don't wait up for me.Let HER ask.I'm busy.Let me think about it, O.K.?Just be patient.Be patient.No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.In six months you can break off from the Corleone Family and go on your own. Carlo, I'm counting on you to make the move to Nevada; you'll be my right-hand man out there. Tom Hagen is no longer the Consigliere.He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas. Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute. No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it. Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.Maybe less...No. I want things very calm for another six months.All I can say is that things are being resolved that are more effective than a thousand buttonmen on the streets. Understood?I'll come to you when I need you.All right, then it's resolved.Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man. What could be more important than that.How did you find out?Not so perfectly if you noticed.You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.You're out, Tom.I'm going to talk to my father.I'll need him.How?Yes.I've always respected you...He talked to you?Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him. I really needed him.Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all. I guess you've figured it all out?I know now. I'll make them call me Don.A week from tonight. In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe.But after the Baptism. I've decided to stand as godfather to Connie's baby.Yes, I promise.I do renounce him.I do renounce them.I do wish to be baptized.Carlo...we've had a change in the plans. Mama, Connie, Kay and the kids will have to take the trip out to Vegas without us.Go back to your house and wait for me...I'll just be a couple of days...You have to answer for Santino.You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people. That little farce you played out with my sister. Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?Barzini is dead. So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene...I want to square all the family accounts tonight. So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did.Don't be frightened. Do you think I'd make my sister a widow? Do you think I'd make your children fatherless? After all, I'm Godfather to your son. No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business. I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there. I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry. Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?Good, good. Leave now; there's a car waiting to take you to the airport.I'll call your wife and tell her what flight you're on.Speak your mind.No. This I have to do.Sit in the car.Where's the boss?Get her home and get a doctor.She's hysterical.Don't ask me.All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.No.", "clean_line": "told lot relatives waiting father going talk father means
