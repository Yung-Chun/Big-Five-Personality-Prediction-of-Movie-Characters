{"Cider-House-Rules-The": {"LARCH": {"raw_line": "In other parts of the world, young men of promise leave home to make their fortunes, battle evil, or solve the problems of the world.I was myself such a young man, when I came to save the orphanage in St. Cloud's... many years ago.Here in St. Cloud's, I have come to understand that promises are rarely kept, that the battle isn't so much against evil as ignorance, and that being successful can't hold a candle to being of *use*.Nor have I solved the problem I came here to solve.Even in the most enlightened times, unwanted babies will manage to be born. That there will always be orphans is simple not a problem to be solved. Here is St. Cloud's, we don't regard the sordid facts of life as problems.In truth, we've only had one real problem.His name was Homer Wells.I named him after the Greek writer. You know Homer, of course?I made his name \"Wells\" because I could tell he was very deep.In truth, Nurse Angela named him-- her father *drilled* wells, and \"Homer\" was one of her family's umpteen cats.\"Good night, you Princes of Maine, you Kings of New England!\"He didn't cry enough for them, if you can believe it.Thus was Homer Wells returned. He was too happy a baby.The second family has an unfortunate gift for getting sounds out of Homer.The rumor was true. They beat him. He couldn't stop crying.Here is St. Cloud's, I try to consider, with each rule I make or break, that my first priority is an orphan's future.Easier said than done.I told the third family to take good care--this was a special boy.It was Homer who took too much good care of himself.What could I do with him? He kept coming back!Homer, if you're going to stay at St. Cloud's, I expect you to be of use.But, in failing to withhold love, had I created a true and everlasting orphan? I had been too successful with Homer Wells. I had managed to make the orphanage his *home*.God forgive me. I have *made* an orphan by loving him too much. Homer Wells will belong to St. Cloud's, forever.First pregnancy?I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?What *else* could I have showed you, Homer? The only thing I can teach you is what I know! In every life, you've got to be of use.Have you ever had ether, Dorothy?It won't make you sick this time, Dorothy--not the way I do it, just a drop at a time.One day, Dorothy, if you have any money, a donation to the orphanage would be very much appreciated.Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.He's a big boy!Would you mind having a look at Dorothy?No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!I looked everywhere else!It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...Obviously.Christ, it's oil of tansy!If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself \"not a doctor\"! Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble.Take care of that, will you?Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.When *doesn't* he have bronchitis? I wouldn't call his bronchial infections \"underdeveloped.\" Would you?\"A dog, which had lain concealed till now, ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl, and collecting himself for a spring, jumped for the dead man's shoulders.\"\"Missing his aim, he fell into a ditch, turning completely over as he went; and striking his head against a stone, dashed his brains out.Good night, you Princes of Maine! You Kings of New England!Life is waiting.Where's the name sheet?It's my turn!Henceforth you shall be... Little Dorrit!Can't a boy be a Dorrit?You do it then.I'm not crazy about the \"Little...\"We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!It is strictly for our orphans' sake that I destroy any record of their natural mothers. Of course they will, one day, want to know. But orphans, especially, should look forward to their *futures*. Not back to their pasts.I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!I was!You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!Some new *things* would be useful. I don't need any \"new help.\"Homer! I need you!I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?Angela, we need a new movie, a new projector, a new typewriter--*that's* what they should replace around here!Homer, would you get this one?Homer, you are a skilled and gifted surgeon. You have near-prefect obstetrical and gynecological procedure.Sure. Okay. You splice. I'll deliver.It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.That's right, Fuzz.Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.She looks after other people's children.No. She was an immigrant.Someone not from Maine.How old are you, dear? Thirteen?Twelve? Are you twelve, dear? You have to tell me how long you've been pregnant. Three months?Are you *four* months pregnant?Dear child, it won't hurt when I look. I'm just going to *look*.Tell me: you haven't done something to yourself, have you?Did you go to someone else?Listen, you've been very brave. I'm going to put you to sleep--you won't feel it anymore. You've been brave enough.You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.If she'd come to you four months ago and asked you for a simple D and C, what would you have decided to do? *Nothing*? *This* is what doing nothing gets you, Homer. It means that someone else is going to do the job--some moron who doesn't know *how*!I wish you'd come to *me*, dear child. You should have come to me, instead.She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...If you expect people to be responsible for their children, you have to give them the right to decide whether or not to *have* children. Wouldn't you agree?How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him.Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?Curly, come here!Chocolates. How *thoughtful*.You're the best, Curly.Just fine.You'll have Princes of Maine! You'll have Kings of New England!I suggest you find yourself some fresh air, Lieutenant.Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!I don't need your gratitude.It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.I don't know! He's just leaving-- you're the one who says he needs to see the world! *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of \"seeing the world,\" isn't it?He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.I think these will fit you.Good night, you Princes of Maine! You Kings of New England.He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to \"help\"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!One has to be more than \"careful\" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether.\"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915...\"\"...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939.\"\"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care...\"Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the \"new blood\" is *for*!Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?So here is my candidate. What do you think?He *will* have them, Edna.So he's an apple expert, is he?Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!I'll show him a *gift*! I'll give him a gift he can *use*!His name is Homer Wells......and his *pathetic* resume is the best I've seen. Though I find it hard to believe the Board would be interested in this character.He looks like a bleeding-heart missionary *moron* to me, but that's going to be the problem with any doctor interested in coming here!*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!I'm not talking about his medical qualifications. It's the *Christian* thing that bothers me--I just don't see it being of much *use* around here.Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time.Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.He's a field hand! What could possibly hold him there?Fuzzy? Fuzzy?I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.They'll believe it because they want to believe it.If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.My dear Homer, I thought you were over your adolescence, that period which I would define as the first time in our lives when we imagine we have something terrible to hide from those who love us.Do you think it's not obvious to us what's happened to you?You're fallen in love, haven't you? By the way, whatever you're up to can't be too good for your heart. Then again, it's the sort of condition that can be made worse by worrying about it. So don't worry about it!Do I interfere? When absolutely helpless women tell me that they simply *can't* have an abortion, that they simply *must* go through with having another--and yet another-- orphan... do I interfere? *Do* I? I do not. I do not even *recommend*. I just give them what they want: an orphan or an abortion. You are my work of art, Homer. Everything else has been just a job. I don't know if you've got a work of art in you, but I know what your job is. You're a doctor!You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!They're going to replace me, Homer! The Board of Trustees is looking for my *replacement*!Sorry? I'm not 'sorry'! Not for anything I've done. I'm not even sorry that I love you!I think we may have lot him to the world.

Everything's fine.We won't tell you, Carla. You're going to be okay.There was no visible wound?It looks like scurvy.Did you look in her purse?It's obviously an aborticide.I don't know it.In other words, scurvy.It's because he's too tired to sleep.

I'm sorry. I couldn't find Buster. Will you tell him...I think I'd probably like the apple business.No, I'm not. I need a job.Is your family in the apple business, too?I've never seen a lobster.I've never seen the ocean, either.I know.Where's Mandalay?Oh...I understand.This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.It's all very normal.It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps? They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.\"Burma run\" because you fly over Burma...At what altitude?What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!It's the flying, right? You love to fly, don't you?Oh, I would love that, Wally.Sure... I'll see you around.How do you do...Migrants?Rose Rose?So. What should I do now?It's the name of a cat. Originally. Well, not *originally*.It's just my heart.There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.Right.Do you like to read?\"I looked at the stars, and considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face to them as he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the glittering multitude.\"More?It's a list of rules, it seems.\"One.

There's no stress or strain around here...Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.Well, sure... that's good, then. All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.I guess so...Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?Okay...I better go.They eat everything?Oh! That's... nice.A movie *outside*?People watched the movies in their cars?Yes! I've only seen one, though.\"King Kong\". It's really good.I *did* like it. All I said was, \"It's not 'King Kong'.\"First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...And what did she die of, exactly?Oh, sure!What's the *medical* explanation?At least King Kong knew what he *wanted*.No trouble.She's the nicest *and* the most beautiful girl I've ever known.I'm not in trouble.What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.Give men that. I know how to do it.Almost.You think? Maybe I was. I love this place!The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?You don't care about the movie?It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.You're not alone in the bathroom, or... or in the shower... you're never alone in wanting the last piece of meatloaaf, or even in your own bed on a cold morning.I miss things. I miss... people. I miss reading to the boys.I never *asked* for any responsibility.Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?Ah-ha. So what is that--a radio?How could you not *care* about the movie?That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?Right.This is easy--I'm not hurrying.Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?*What* will be okay?I'll just move on, get another job somewhere.Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.Uh... sure.Right.I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.Dear Dr. Larch, thank you for your doctor's bag......although it seems that I will not have the occasion to use it.Barring some emergency, of course. I am not a doctor. With all due respect to your profession. I am enjoying my life here.I've looked at so many women... I mean, I've seen *everything* about them, *everything*... but I never felt a thing. I felt nothing. Now... with you... it *hurts*... to look at you.I am enjoying being a lobsterman and an orchardman--in fact, I have never enjoyed myself so much.The truth is, I want to stay here. I believe I am being of *some* use.Dear Dr. Larch, what I am learning here may not be as important as what I learned from you, but everything is new to me. Yesterday I learned how to poison mice. You use poison oats and poison corn.Field mice girdle an apple tree. Pine mice kill the roots. I *know* what you have to do--you have to play God. Well... killing mice is as close as I want to come to playing God.I am not a doctor.I can't replace you! I'm sorry......bridges, oil refineries, fuel depots...Where's Jack?So we should \"wait and see.\" For how long?Fine. That's all there is to it then.Okay, okay--I know you do, too.You okay, Rose?I don't like watching anyone be sick.How many months are you?You're not yet three months, are you?I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?But you don't look very happy.Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.Mr. Rose *knows*?Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?Is it true?Are you sleeping with your own daughter?You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.But she's your *daughter*...She's *pregnant*. Do you know *that*?How long's this been going on, Muddy?There are no autonomic effects, are there?There are no autonomic effects, just the paralysis of the lower extremities.Wally can have kids, a normal sex life...Good night, Ray.Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.Isn't that like waiting and seeing?I know. Is *that* nothing.It's a tempting idea, I know... to do nothing.*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all...You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!I know, I'm sorry.He's *alive*. He still loves you. So do I.Nothing. You're not the one who has to do anything.Hey, hey! Stop it. Maybe I can help.Please listen to me! *Both* of you...Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business. If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.No *almost* about it--I'm a doctor.Get out of here, please.Okay. Then you can be of use.You better get some air.\"One: Please don't smoke in bed.\"\"Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch.\"\"Three: Please--even if you are very hot--do not go up to the roof to sleep.\"This is the last one.\"Four: There should be no going up on the roof at night.\"That's it.Right.No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?\"...did.\" Well, okay.And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...At least there's no more waiting and seeing. At least I got to see the ocean.Where'd she get you?There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.Right?She knows how to take care of herself.Sure. Thanks.I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.You told me you weren't any good at being alone. You told Wally, too. Right?He's going to be fine, Wally's going to be fine. I know he is.Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.You know what? I did.It's from the ocean. It's for you.Sure. It's my heart.Fuzzy's?!\"Thus I began my new life, in a new name, and with everything new about me... I felt... like one in a dream... The remembrance of that life is fraught with so much... want of hope... Whether it lasted for a year, or more, or less, I do not know.
