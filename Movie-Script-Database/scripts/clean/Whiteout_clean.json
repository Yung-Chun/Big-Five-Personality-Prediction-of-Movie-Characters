{"Whiteout": {"CARRIE": {"raw_line": "Alright --Hey Fred, unlock any secrets of the Universe -- discover we're Alien life forms?Which one's Sapperstein?Okay, thanks.Wanted to see me?All what?Professor Sapperstein, I'd like you to read something for me.Keep reading.Very good. Now are you still sure you want to report the theft of an illegal narcotic?Good. And how are you feeling right now?No, no, not crazy. But this time of year, down here, we're all going a little toasty aren't we? How about you plant a little Cannabis when you get home?What do you think? I know you weren't in the area. What's up?What flavor?And we were doing so well. Where?McClain Valley? What was he doing out there? That's no man's land.No -- just the picture.Bottom of the frickin' planet.Doc?Keller.Checking the freezer for a popsicle.It got called in this morning.Delfy, one of the pilots here.Yeah -- probably....Were you the second guy from the front?Not interested.Fine. I need a plane and that pilot who saw the popsicle.Yeah, good.I wish -- We got a job. I need you to take a ride with me.So it is.My gut and I don't talk anymore.Not you.Or mentioned her. A grandchild? Doc, that's great.You Delfy?Delfy's taking us, Doc. He's the one who saw the body. C'mon, you'll be fine. I'll even hold your hand if you want.What were you doing out there?That your son?He's cute. Has your eyes.So why aren't you with him?Hate it.We all make stupid mistakes.Yeah. Got it. It's a popsicle alright.Linger.So do you. Think his name's Weiss. We Wintered-over last year with him. Played cards a couple of times.Yeah. Geologist, I think.Then where's his crampons -- his gear?Yeah, maybe --What the hell where you doing all the way out here?You going to be alright?Oh yeah -- I'm really going to miss this place.Who manages the Post Stations?One - two - three...It bothers me no one's reported him missing yet.How'd he get out there? There were no tracks.Nobody wants to get out of here more than I do, trust me, but right now -- we're all this guy has.Grab that side....I'll be alright.I know.Exactly, this is the first murder in Antarctica, Doc -- and I can't just pretend it didn't happen. I'm sorry.I'm on my way to find out.I'm sure his family's thinking the same thing.I hate interrupting educational programming, but --Chaplain.What are they doing out there?English, please.I don't get it -- Weiss was no where near Delta One One.Isn't that a little unusual this close to Winter-over?-- You've been a little busy. Yeah, I can see that.Delta One One, this is United States Marshall Carrie Stetko, come back, over.Vostok? Patch it through.This is Marshal Stetko, who's this?Mooney?What happened out there, Mooney?Where's Rubin?Getting drunk already?Murphy's contacting the Feds.I'll do everything I can to get you off this ice, promise.Going to Vostok.I need a plane to Vostok.I'm not asking.Tell them I took their plane.The Russians barely supply Vostok anymore. They have to barter with other bases for supplies. Some of these guys have been rotting here for years.Who's in charge?Stetko, US Marshal. I'm here to talk to an American named Mooney.I figured.Where is he?Against the law -- Antarctica's the only place in the world you can't have one. Part of the Treaty.All this crap on -- I prefer naked.Do you have to do that in front of me?Sure.Nope. Thoughts?Mooney? Hello?...My God.Jack?What happened?Yeah. Someone got to him before I did. Then went after me. How long was I out?Thanks.Let it go, Delfy.Unless you want your head cracked, I wouldn't move.-- Let me see your hands.Let's see it -- slowly.How do you know about Weiss?This is part of a crime scene.I'll be sure to let the U.N. know if I find out anything.Maybe.Don't take this personally, but I don't need your help.You don't dig for meteorites.Fine. But this is my investigation, understand? If you obstruct it in any way, I will have you detained.No, but I have the feeling you're going to anyway.Murphy, listen to me, it's got to be Rubin who tried to kill me. You have to shut down flights leaving ASB and McMurdo -- search for him.Sam, I think these guys found something out there at the camp. I'm going to check it out. Until I find Rubin, no one leaves the ice. Not yet.Guess so.What time is it?A.M. or P.M.?Wonderful. I'll take this one.Rubin?Someone's left leg took a hit, lost a lot of blood. What do you got?Looks like they were surveying sections at a time.Yeah --Looks like they hit some really big meteors.About four miles.I want to check something out first.North.Yeah, a little.Almost two years.The excitement, mostly.Some shrink tell you that?And do you?Where do you plant your boots?I came down to fill in for a Marshal for six weeks before Winter-over. I met someone, decided to stay.No -- just gave me a headache.This is it.Just stop.Section 104. These are the coordinates.This is shaved ice.I'm slipping!I'm losing my grip....I'm okay.Cargo plane, but I don't recognize it.Guess that makes three.Where's Pryce?What is that?Find what you're looking for?And by the looks of that safe, must've been transporting something pretty important.Whoever got hurt, they dragged him out of here. There's blood all over the tunnel.Go!No signal, you?How long do you figure we've got?What about the Vodka -- we could make some torches, maybe melt the ice?What choice do we have?What're you doing?We came in through it.Or, if the ice is too thick the blast will come right back at us.Don't move.Our friend here isn't who he says he is.Stop lying to me --He was saving his own. Do it.Have you got an ID for that too?Why did you lie to me?Plane could've gone anywhere. There's forty-six countries here all counting down to Winter-over. Rubin could just disappear in the mayhem.Heading back. How many fly-ins to McMurdo in the last four hours?-- How many?I need a list of names.He knows I'm on his ass, so he might. Anything's possible. I want to eliminate his options.Back at ASB --I know why Weiss was so far from Delta One One.I'll have the Doc take a peek when we're done.Murphy? What the hell is he doing HEREI'm on 30 if you need me. Rubin's picture is in a file on my desk.You wanted to see me?Buried under 2 tons of ice. You?Sure thing, Chief.It didn't work, Sam, because you couldn't keep your hands off every new woman who stepped foot on the ice down here. I was stupid enough to be one of them. Now if you could cut through your red tape for just one second, you would realize that someone's out there with six cannisters, possibly full of Uranium, and he wants to get it into the hands of some very bad people. And I'm trying to stop it -- so fuck asking you for shit, Sam.You know what Doc, it's alright.You worry too much -- but it's what I like about you.Then it's gotta be Rubin. I don't know.There's no way they're gonna make it. Not with that storm coming in over the peninsula.When did I go to Vostok?No.No way. Don't tell me that.Pretty tough Marshal, huh?...You ever kill anyone?Anyone you ever trusted?I hadn't held a gun in my hand for over two years. Wasn't supposed to need one down here.We were on a stakeout at a Holiday Inn in Miami, waiting for this buy to go down. I was excited, we'd been after this trafficker for a long time. Thought this bust would be my big chance to impress the brass. Anyway, guy's a no show. One hour went by, then two - - nothing.These beakers where really in over their heads.Think you can you help me with these buttons, first?Who are you?Mooney's dead.And so's Weiss.It's okay, you're safe, just put the knife down.Rubin -- I need you to focus for me.It's okay, he's a doctor, he can help you.Rubin's here! He's on the run. Level one. White T-shirt. Jeans.Rubin, wait!Rubin -- I can help you!Door's jammed --Shit, Rubin doesn't have any gear on.Thirty seconds.Where are the cannisters?Help me drag him over here.Why did you kill those scientists, Keller? Was a four-way split too much for you?Where is the uranium?Let go of me.The cannisters are on the plane.He's with the UN. We have to search that plane now!Sam, do what is right here. Come on.We'll need some help.Nothing. That bastard. What the hell are you up to, Keller?He's buying time.Out of the way!Shit!He won't try. He's a goddamn pilot.No! You stay awake!Press here. Hard. Hard or he will die!He's not going to be number four!You're bleeding out. Freezing drops your pulse. We have to slow it down. You hold on.Keller got out. He hurt Pryce -- he's bleeding bad. Where's Doc?Tell him to stay put, and I need your help getting Pryce there. We're at the hangar. I've got to stop Keller, he's got the cannisters.Keller hit him with an ice axe.No.I'll stay with you --I'm sorry.Thanks.Hey back.Um-hm.Nope.After all this, no way. Keller didn't have it on the plane because he's got it hidden somewhere. Where would he hide something for six months. Somewhere he could be sure no one would ever look.True -- what the hell was his plan...Need any help?Just thinking where it all began.Nothing -- I'll be right back.Someplace no one would ever think to look.And we thought it was nukes the whole time.How did you get wrapped up in thing, Doc?Then Weiss got cold feet. It got ugly, didn't it -- and Keller killed him at Delta One One. Everything went to hell after that, didn't it, Doc.Doc -- stop.There is no granddaughter, is there? This was about greed, plain and simple.Dead is dead, right?What's happened to you? There are four people dead! Four! People we knew. Doc looks at her. She's not sure if it's registering.Doc, your not thinking straight.Doc, please.Hot. But there's a gentle breeze. Fiji's beautiful this time of year.Nah.

Your base commander called it in.I realize that, but considering the time constraints we're up against, let's be honest, taping and bagging everything isn't going to be an option.You heading out to Delta One One?I'll grab my bag.If they've been digging out there, that's a direct violation of the United Nations treaty. We think they were digging. That makes it my business.And you don't get killed for them either. This is now a U.N. matter. I am within my rights to commandeer your pilot and plane if I have to.Fine.

Tell you he was going to marry you?Flattered that you even looked.You sure this is right?Hold my legs!Almost got you.Carrie? Can you hear me?Just answers. Those are fuel tanks behind you. This plane was outfitted for long range capabilities.They put some serious work into this.This isn't going to work, it's like digging through concrete with a spoon.

Take your pick.Delfy, help me with this. We'll need to get up higher.What's going on?I've been authorized because of what's happened.Don't do this.CIA.Listen to me -- Forty eight hours ago, we picked up chatter between someone down here and Tahir Soufian, a black market trader in New York. It was all about setting up a buy for cannisters found in an old Russian transport buried in the ice.There's been rumors for years that the Russians had a second base -- a secret weapons research facility under the ice that supposedly blew up in the late sixties -- nothing was ever confirmed.Look, the U.N. carries a lot of weight down here. Think about it - - if I had told you I was C.I.A., you would have been on the horn back to Washington in no time. This is a very sensitive matter. News travels fast down here, I don't have to tell you that. Besides, I didn't know if I could trust you.Six cannisters, maybe four inches in diameter, about a foot high -- find out exactly what the Russians transported in something that size.How long to get there?I'll scan a picture of him and get it to you. Meanwhile, contact every non-American base down here and put them on watch. He's got some plan to get these off the ice.You need to get that looked at.Of course.I stopped by the clinic... Doc told me.Got Rubin's face all over Antarctica, but nobody's seen him yet....Unfortunately.No.What happened?It's what the Russians used to transport weapons grade materials in. They match the dimensions inside the safe. We're looking for six of these.I better get this back to him. And we have to find Rubin.Sure.Yeah?How long's he been out there?Wrong answer.Who's Tahir selling it to -- what's the intended target?Hit the sonofabitch again!Name's Pryce.It's a twelve hour flight to Christchurch. Anything can happen in that time. Keller is here, so we know it's still on the ground.It's clean.I don't get it, why lie to us -- we have him either way. He's stuck here.He's got nowhere to go, nowhere to hide....I didn't see him.What are you doing? Get Keller.Hey --You get him?The cannisters?What did we miss? Think Keller cut and run without the stuff?If he had made it out, he wouldn't have been crazy enough to come back for it.We've got six months to figure it out.Hey, Doc -- thanks.What is it?How's the weather where you are?Yeah, St. Barts ain't bad either.", "clean_line": "stetko fbi notified base commander called realize considering time constraints let honest taping bagging isn going option heading delta ll grab bag ve digging direct violation united nations treaty think digging makes business killed matter rights commandeer pilot plane fine mind ask personal question smell like suntan lotion ready thirty daily work log ground penetrating radar areas labeled sections spent day far let hurt long marshal brought ice running away yeah mother oftenevery sunday got working christchurch new zealand beautiful country crazy place living ring saw tell going marry flattered looked sure right hold legs got carrie hear answers fuel tanks plane outfitted long range capabilities work isn going work like digging concrete spoon going suffocate hours burn quicker hold planes bail hatches blown suffocate freeze death pick delfy help ll need higher going ve authorized happened cia listen hours ago picked chatter tahir soufian black market trader new york setting buy cannisters old russian transport buried ice rumors years russians second base secret weapons research facility ice supposedly blew late sixties confirmed look carries lot weight think told horn washington time sensitive matter news travels fast tell know trust cannisters maybe inches diameter foot high exactly russians transported size long ll scan picture contact non american base watch got plan ice need looked course stopped clinic doc told got rubin face antarctica seen unfortunately happened russians transport weapons grade materials match dimensions inside safe looking better rubin sure yeah long wrong answer tahir selling intended target hit sonofabitch pryce hour flight christchurch happen time keller know ground clean lie way stuck got hide keller hey cannisters miss think keller cut run stuff wouldn crazy come ve got months figure hey doc thanks weather yeah st barts ain bad"}}}
