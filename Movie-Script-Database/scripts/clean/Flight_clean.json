She maxed out her credit card to buy me that camera and a lighting kit.It's just so beautiful here. Did you grow up here?And your mom?I'm pretty sure my father lives in Colorado.He drank. It was my mom that raised me. She was incredible.She held it together for so long, I couldn't tell how sick she was. Even through chemo she looked beautiful.They gave her very heavy meds for pain. Dilauded, morphine, oxycontin. I started taking them with her. We would get all medicated and sit in our back yard and talk and talk and watch the sun go down. We'd be so stoned that we couldn't get up to go inside when it got dark. I know it sounds crazy to get hooked on dope with your mom, but she was dying and we spent her last seven months together like teenagers, trading stories about boys and whatever. She loved me.Are you okay? How was it?Well, I got through my first day. They haven't fired me.They needed someone to work the night shift. They asked me and it's time and a half so...I gotta vest and here's my name tag. Oh oh oh....I got you something.. It's a P-51 mustang on there...

I can't stay at my condo.Not yet.You're not. Just take me to the airport to get my car.God landed the plane?I'm good with coffee.They find the flight data recorders?Great. That solves everything. The recorders will tell the story. Why do we need a lawyer from Chicago?Criminal negligence?The plane fell apart at 30 thousand feet.I had to fly that plane inverted, that means upside down, Hugh. Do you get the picture? 100 passengers hanging upside down, 500 feet off the ground. Do you have any idea what that sounds like?Are you a pilot?Then you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.Charlie, what do I need to know? I'm already tired of this guy.When did they do that?Do they have the results of these blood tests?Did I just see warm cinnamon rolls come out?Bring me one wouldya? Actually bring me two, okay sweetie?What does that mean? I had a beer the night before I flew. And what...That made the tail of the plane explode?I need a lawyer.I need a bigger lawyer. A lawyer who understands that I flew a broken plane and without me at that stick there'd be 102 funerals, notTo write checks, well it's not me I promise you that. And as long as they're writing checks, write me one because someone put me in a broken plane. I'd love a check.I'm not worried, Charlie. I promise you that.

Is this all the stuff you want from here?Okay, start taking that stuff down.You wanna spend a thousand bucks suing her and get jack shit? Or do you want to make a cash deal with me?You're a creep...with your baseball bat bullshit...I'll give you 400 in cash.Good boy. Now help her get that box in her car.Your car doesn't run? What were you gonna do?Then put the fucking box in my car.Whip.You okay?Okay.Yea. I want you to stay.That feels better.C'mon in. I'll shoot you inside.You just decided to drop by?I turned it off.Okay, gimme a minute. Wait here.The left wing partially pulled away-I drank a lot the night before that flight. I drank that morning too and I used coke to straighten up.But that's not the reason this happened.Why'd you bring me here?You trying to scare me?Who's God would do this?I'll stop. I can stop. I told you I can stop. I won't drink.Don't, don't, don't! I'll get him. Knuckles, junior. See him. Yeah. I'm not calling again. Fuck him. He didn't call. Not back. Not calling back.Morning.Tired. Guess I drank a bit.You wanna count the fuckin' beers? They're still in the garbage. Vodka too, is that okay with you?Good.Lemme see that camera.It was my grandfather's farm, my dad grew up here. He was a pilot in World War II, flew with the 332nd. See the landing strip out there? He built that. He ran a crop duster outta here until the EPA put an end to that. He traded the crop duster for a used Cessna. He flew that damn thing all over. It's still in the barn. I was gonna sell this place after my dad died. Then I got divorced...Dead...she's dead. Your dad still alive?You got no relationship with him.You too Margaret. Broken collar bone?I didn't go in. I couldn't.No. I can't, really. I will, but just not now.Yeah...y'know...I'm in the middle of this investigation. The NTSB is investigating the crash-I'm nervous because I was out the night before the crash at dinner-Yeah and I had two glasses of wine. And they might ask you about my condition that morning and if you thought I had anything to drink.What?You have to tell them it was an ordinary day. I mean it was an ordinary day. You know I was in shape to fly. You have a problem with saying that?My lack of sleep made the plane fall apart, huh Margaret? I'm just trying to get it straight. You think that another pilot would have been able to land that plane and save more lives?Well can you imagine Trevor at this same church looking at you in that box in there? Or my son having to come and see me in prison?It was an ordinary day. The storm right after we took off was very severe, but as far as the flight crew was concerned it was a perfectly ordinary day.It was okay, okay. How're you doin'?That's good. Cause for a celebration.He did. So should we get some dinner?No, it's okay. You should go.Open meeting?Even me?I gotta go. Okay? Can uh...How're you feeling, Ken?I'm Captain Whitaker, I was flying-Listen, how long have you been...I didn't mean to disrupt your whole day. I know they been swamping you with interviews. You were great on CNN...I'm sorry Ken.I don't know how much you remember, but the plane started to fall apart.What are we talking about?I just wanted to get a sense from you what you thought caused the crash.You think you'd be alive without me on that plane?I'm not gonna argue anything with you.Praise Jesus.Looks great right?It's a Cessna 172, it was my dad's. He kept it perfect.Yeah, he flew this plane a few months before he died. I learned to fly in this plane. You can land it anywhere.My friend Harling and I flew it to Jamaica.We set off for an overnight fishing trip two hours south of here. We ended up in Bethel, Jamaica.It was like a picture on a post card. The white sand and sky blue water. Most beautiful place I've ever been.Yeah, really warm.Let's go.Let's go tomorrow.We'll leave in the morning...we'll just go. Start over.It's a beautiful beach, it's paradise.I'm fine thanks.You go to a couple of AA meetings and all of a sudden you think you're Jesus Christ? Worry about yourself.WE'RE NOT-I didn't suck dick to get high. And don't give me a whole...Your mom died and dad drank and bullshit, bullshit, bullshit --Is that why you shot dope?Well there's a lot of people out there who lost their mom who've never had a drink in their life.I choose to drink.I choose to drink! And I blame it on me. I'm happy to. I've got an ex-wife and a son I don't see. Why? Because I choose to drink!Alright look, I was loaded when I crashed that plane. With this investigation going on, I don't know what's gonna happen. Come to Jamaica with me.Come with me. I need help, I do.When we get to Jamaica we can go to the local hospital. I'll do it for you. Anything you want.I'll be sober. I won't force you to stay. I promise if you don't like it or if I don't clean up? You can leave.It's so beautiful there. We'll leave before noon. I'm a great pilot. You'll get to see so much.Yeah, I'm here. What's goin' on?Look, it's simple. I flew a broken plane.And what about my toxicology report?Okay. I see...where this is going. That's funny that they found two bottles.Because I drank three. One's missing.Fuck you too, Hugh.Can I go now?Yeah. So?Great. I'm going home.What fucking life?! Don't kill yourself on my account, Hugh.You wanna talk about me like I'm not here? Like I'm fucking dead?Yeah Charlie just get him home. Sober him up long enough to save the union's contract and that fat fuck's airline. Fuck you. I shoulda died on that plane.It's lovely to see you too Deana. May I come in?Thought I`d come see you and Will.Call you? Like anyone in this house has called me in the last three years to say anything other than \"Where's the money?\"Well that took...what? 17 seconds? It took 17 seconds for you-LADIES and GENTLEMEN it took EXACTLY 17 SECONDS FOR DEANA COLEMAN to ask me if I have been drinking! A NEW WORLD RECORD!You're asking me to leave the house I bought for you?! Very good.William Whitaker, junior. The man of the house. Nice of you to call me back.You are? Are you the man of the house?I'm your father, tough guy.You don't know who the fuck I am!What did you say?I'm outta here. I'm outta here. I know where I'm not wanted.Folks, please give us some room. At the appropriate time I will tell my story. Now is a time for grieving and taking care of those injured. Thank you. I appreciate your interest in me but I ask that you leave my family in peace.I'm Captain Whitaker, I was-Can you get me to my car?Now is a time for grieving and taking care of those injured. Thank you. I appreciate your interest in me but I ask that you leave my family in peace.Hey, Charlie. Thank you. Amanda was so nice to let me in. It's just...I couldn't find a safe place.I think it's okay. I've been watching and I think it's okay.Okay. Good then. Listen Charlie, here's the deal-No. I can do this.Let's just stick to the plan.This whole thing has just been so heavy, it's killing me. Tell Hugh, I can do it. Look, I really wanna fly again, get back to my life and be done with all this shit.Let me stay here. They have my houses all staked out now. Let me stay here until the hearing, Charlie. I won't leave the house.I won't drink.Thank you. I feel really good.9 days... Two hours and 26 minutes...but who's counting?Wait, Charlie, thanks for letting me stay with you. I needed it.You've got a beautiful family.So does she have the knife out for me?Hello? Anyone?Yes!!! I'm dead!!!Amazing grace...how sweet the sound...that saved a wretch like me-I once was lost and now I'm found was blind but...now...well I'm still kinda blind.Call Harling Mays.Harling's got cocaine.609-237-1184. We're in 609 so just...Tell him I need bananas...The banana boat is here.Thanks brother, I'm back.I love you too.Do not tell me how to lie about my drinking. I've been lying about my drinking my whole life.Morning.I'm not sure it was conscious. It was more of an instinct.I don't recall.I heard a metallic bang. We pitched nose down. No control.There was a lot of things wrong with that aircraft.Yes.There was some convective activity in the area. However, my first officer and I discussed the conditions on the field and determined that we were safely within our visibility and crosswind minimums.I appreciate that.Yes, I understand.No. I did not.No. I did not.No.Yes. I suspended the drink service.Yes.I am now.Outside of work? Not really.No. I did not.No. I did not.No. I did not.Can you repeat the question?I'm sorry. My what...I SAID...God help me...She saved that boy's life...I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT SHE DID NOT DRINK THAT VODKA......because I did. I drank the vodka.I drank the vodka bottles on the plane.You don't have to readdress anything. I DRANK THE VODKA!On October 11th, 12th and 13th and 14th I was intoxicated. I drank alcohol on all of those days. I drank to excess.I was drunk. I'm drunk right now, Miss Block...I'm drunk right... I'm drunk now, because... Because I'm an alcoholic.That was it...I was done. It's as if I'd hit my life long limit for lies.I could not tell one more lie. And maybe I'm a sucker. Because if I had just told one more lie? I could have walked away from that whole mess and kept my wings and my false sense of pride and most importantly I would have avoided being locked up here with all of you nice folks for the last 13 months.It looks like I will serve every day of the remaining 4 plus years of my sentence. And that's fair. I betrayed the public trust. I did. That's what the judge explained to me. I had betrayed the public trust. The FAA took my license. And that's fair. The chances of me flying again are slim to none. And I accept that.I've had time to think about all of it. Doing a lot of writing. I've written letters to each of the families that lost loved ones on my flight. Some were able to hear my apology, some never will. I've also apologized to all the people who tried to help me along the way, but I couldn't or wouldn't listen, like my wife, I mean my ex wife... ...and my son. Again, some were able to forgive me...some never will. But at least I'm sober, and I'm grateful for that.And this is gonna sound really stupid coming from a man who's in prison...but for the first time in my life...I'm free.Knuckles, you're looking good. I sent you something for your birthday.This is a real surprise; a great surprise. I haven't seen you-Great. An interview. Okay.Listen Will, it means everything to me that you came here.

Wind's gusting to 29. 30 is our crosswind max.Orlando ground. SouthJet 227 will be ready to go at the end.Elevator trim - set. Flaps, One, two, three - set. Radios - set.Cleared for take off, SouthJet 227.Airspeed's alive, both sides... Engine instruments are in the green...100 knots crosscheck...That's wind shear!

This is SouthJet 227, We need to divert 30 degrees right......for weather.Report back on course.Oh, Lord!Why are you leveling off, sir?We're approaching maximum airspeed!You're over-speeding!Center...uh...SouthJet 227 is leaving niner thousand...for Flight Level 180.Look at your airspeed! You're too fast for this rough air!Glad that's over.16 thousand. That was incredible sir...My plane.26 minutes. We're going to start descending any second now.Descend and maintain 30 thousand.The stabilizer feels really stiff.I have very little trim control sir.It's pulling right. Hard!I have no trim at all!Your plane.It's stiff as hell. We're pitching up. Slowing a bit.Gear's down. I don't think hydraulics is the problem.Too fast for flaps.21 thousand!We're still fast.I got it.Nothing! No control!I can't reach it.OH NO!Oh Lord, we're descending at 4,700 feet per minute, out of 7,000. I SEE NOTHING BUT HOUSES!Trim down?! What are you gonna do?!You mean trim up?! Right?

Thank you. Come on in sir. Shut the door.Outta the coma? Two days.Both my legs were crushed and my pelvis snapped. I'll probably never walk again, least not without a walker or braces. I'll certainly never fly again.That plane was doomed the second you sat in the chair. You reeked like gin or somethin'. I called Vicki from the plane before we took off. That's when the rain kicked up.I remember everything until we crashed. I know what went on.I don't know Captain Whitaker, what are we talking about?Was it the fact that you got on the plane drunk from the night before?The NTSB is coming back tomorrow to finish taking a deposition from me about the events on the flight.No, we'd all be dead. But are you gonna argue that your physical state was tip top?Sit, please sit. I never shared my opinion about your physical state the morning of the flight. I've never said word.The flight was pre-ordained. I've prayed on it Captain. Vicki and I have prayed on it. There's only one judge --And he has a higher plan for you sir. This event although tragic in its loss of life is also a celebration of life.Nothing happens in the Kingdom of the Lord by mistake.Captain, will you pray with me?Jesus our Lord and savior we thank you for blessing Captain Whitaker with courage and wisdom. For guiding his hand on that fateful morning. In his divine light we were saved.
