Do they make me look smarter? I need a new pair.Hi. I'm originally from Prescott, Arizona. Followed my mom out here about four years ago. That's her back there.My parents are divorced. Not her fault.I've always had this knack for telling stories. Ever since I was a kid.Moved here. Took a couple writing classes. Decided to go for it. 24/7. Total dedication to my craft. The writing always comes first. My latest effort is called Sleeping on the Moon. It's about rejection. And pain. Not really about the moon itself. More of a...Right.My favorite writer? Favorite writer. Favorite writer...Favorite. Wow. Hard to say. I've studied Composition more than actual Literature. Gee. I know Maureen enjoys Jane...That's the one. I hear she's good. But my favorite writer? Let me think about that a bit, OK?I didn't go to college.I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for missing the meeting.As a matter of fact, I did meet a guy.His name's Brian.He's my new agent!An agent. I've got an agent!That writing class I took? Well, for the final project, I turned in the first chapter of Sleeping on the Moon. I guess the teacher liked it. Then he gave it to his friend who's an agent. Brian. He called. Had to see me right away. Brian wants to sign me.Thank you. But I just want to remind everyone that we're all in this together. I couldn't have come this far without the group.I'm merely the first one to get signed. But we're all going to have an agent soon.Thank you! 'Night.Your turn will come, Henry. You're a better writer than I am. So much better. You went to college.He's a great writer. Henry Obert. I knew him when.Sure. I can't believe I've lived out here four years and haven't seen --Oh, my.Four years. It's been four years since I moved here. And now I have an agent. It's the number four again. My lucky number. I should have known this was going to happen.I'm going to dedicate my novel to you.Have I thought of my favorite author yet? No. Not yet. There are so many, you know?So. I am somewhat superstitious. Yes. Guilty. I'm drawn to the number 4. I was born at exactly 4:04 p.m. on April 4th. 4-4-4-4. That wasn't an accident. No way.Certain things I've learned to avoid. Black cats. Cracked mirrors. Oh. And the number 13 especially. I hate the number 13. Hate it.Colette. What a lovely surprise!My, what's this?So sweet of you, Colette.Gee. I don't really know.I guess so. Maybe.Let's talk about this at group meeting, OK?Colette Mooney. C-o-l-e-t-t-e M-o-o- n-e...13 letters. Oh, dear...Thanks for seeing me today, Alan.Something that makes me look smart.Mmmmmmm.Of course he would.Could be a winner.What do you think?Oh. I don't know--Um. Sure. Probably could be.Hello? Yes. Oh, hi, Brian. Really? Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god!Oh my god!He sold my novel.Brian sold Sleeping on the Moon!Yes, Brian. I will. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I will. Promise. Thank you!Thank you.The group. Oh, dear. The group. No, no, I can't tell them about this.Oh.It will seem like I'm bragging or something. I mean I'm the one with an agent. Now this. It could be too much, too soon, don't you think?Thank you, my friend. I can always depend on you, can't I?Ohhhhhh. For me? You shouldn't have.You're all making too much of a spectacle here.A year. Takes about a year.I did OK. Leave it at that. What's important is that I owe this success to all of you. I would be lost without this writing group.Well, John. Congratulations.I-I . . .Henry. This is good. So good.I'm dying to know more about Scott and Christy. What great characters.You'll figure it out, Henry. It'll pass. Focus on your writing. No distractions. The writing comes first.Who lives here?Oh. That writer you like?Can't say I've read his stuff. Nice house, though.Fitzgerald? He's the one who shot himself, right?I've never read it.Could you turn that off for a few minutes, please?I've never read The Great Gatsby.Henry. I never went to college. I've heard of Hemingway. A little. Fitzgerald. Somewhere. But I don't have your education. Your smarts. I haven't read all these great novels. My stories come from my heart.Tell me about the book.And it's your favorite?So how does it end? Does boy get the girl?Oh, I needed this break. Thank you, Henry.It's just that I'm starting to feel the pressure, you know? There is so much riding on this first book.Beverly Hills, ah...What a dear, sweet friend you are.No distractions. The writing comes first, 'kay?Writer's block can be very serious, John.Gee, I-I guess...I really never thought of them that way.No. It's always been a friendship.No. Friends. Nothing more.I'd be uncomfortable with any changes in the relationship.How much?But if I loaned you money, then I wouldn't have it.Sorry. It's bad luck to loan money.How am I doing? OK. Sort of. Brian called. Looks like there's real interest in movie rights for Sleeping on the Moon. Yeah, thanks.But I don't dare say anything to the group. They find out I've got a movie deal--I don't know. I'm sensing enough jealousy as it is, you know? Could be awkward if they found out. It's a real--what's that word?That's it. I'm in one.\"Please come home, Michael.\" \"Why would you want to marry me, Kyra? I barely graduated high school.\" \"Michael, I don't care about some silly college degree. You're the most intelligent person I've ever known. You are my shining star.\"I value your feedback. We're all in this together, right?Colette--Did the new scene work for you?But my editor wants rewrites. Am I on track?What do you think, Henry?Wouldn't miss your signing, John.William said he'd meet us here.You're a pretend writer, William.I've never seen him before.Hello.Who?I don't know. We just talked.We just talked, Henry. I mentioned my book. He started asking about it. Writer to writer. No big deal.Look, a guy like that reads more books in a week than I ever have. Why would he bother call--Hello? Who? Richard? Oh. Richard. Hi.Coffee? Oh, God. I don't know, Richard. I really appreciate the invitation, but--This isn't a good time. Call me later. Yes. I'll think about it. Yes. Bye.What?I don't like what you're suggesting, Colette. You know how hard I work. How devoted I am. And I have been totally supportive of your writing. I've encouraged you all along.Brian didn't want to meet you. I asked.Your writer's block?It's because your focus is always on everything else. Gatsby. Fitzgerald. Me.Listen to me, Henry Obert. Your writing must come first. Take this passion you have. Put it on the page. Forget everything else. All you're doing is wasting...Here you--He's making me a better writer.Henry. Don't.Why isn't it enough that I'm your friend?Why isn't it enough that I believe in your writing?--That I believe in you?I'm not--I'm not the one delivering pizzas for a living.I'm not the one wasting my talent. You've read all those books, sure, but my book is being published. Is yours?STOP!I'm leaving.It's time. Richard is going to mentor me. Today's the 22nd. Two plus two equals four and we all know four's...Anyway, I'm quitting.Henry . . .Exciting, isn't it? I'm so nervous. I don't know half these people. Most of them are Richard's friends.Nobody's showed up from my old writing group. Not one. Probably shouldn't be surprised. Haven't really heard from anyone in months.Favorite writer? You keep asking me that. Too funny. Sorry. Still can't think of one.Oh my God!Henry. Ohhhhh. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much for coming.You're the only one from the group who showed up.I can't believe you remembered my signing.Please stay.Oh.A flight attendant?Well, then. Guess you can't stay.One sec. Wait here.This is for you.Take it.Do you want to say hello to Richard?C'mon. It will take just a minute.Just say hi.Oh, c'mon. You'll --Welcome to Sleeping on the Moon: The Movie! It's so exciting!Let's see. My book ended up on the best sellers list. Stopping at NumberThen Richard left me.I'm sure the two were connected. No loss. Such an ego. But guess what? I've gone back to school!Look what I'm reading for class. Isn't that pretty, you know, what do they call it? What's that word?Ironic. That's it. Pretty ironic. But I'm going to get my degree. Then I'll be smart. Really smart.You know how you kept asking me that question. Who's my favorite writer?Turns out I do have one. Mr. Henry Obert. He's become a great writer.
