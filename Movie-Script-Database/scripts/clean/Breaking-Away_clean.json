He has momentarily lost ground on her but he sticks the paper in his mouth and pours it on.Signorina...You...

At home they sit and look at your. picture: Ah, they are saying, how we miss our Katherina, our bambina... Katherine is near tears. The homelife Dave's describing is obviously not hers. Not wanting to cry she takes out a cigarette and a lighter and Dave, being a continental gentleman, takes the lighter from her. He doesn't know what to make of it. He fiddles with it and then strikes and a huge jet of flame shoots out. Dave-is frightened. He lets go of the button, but the lighter is stuck and the flame is still burning., He blows'on it. He shakes it. Katherine starts laughing. Finally, in desperation Dave pours coffee on the lighter and it goes out. Cont.You shouldn't smoke.. I go bring more coffee. He takes the cups toward the self-service cafeteria line.The Germans... . they use interval training and the Italians... they don't. The Italians... they beat the pants off Germans.

The ZTH ITALIAN seems amused.Oggi fa caldo, none vero?'Cho tempo Para piovera?Mi scusi! The 4th Italian appreciates this little reversal. The lst Italian is getting a brutal look in his face.I guess.Oh, Dad... He can't help himself anymore. He bursts into tears and hugs his father. Mr. Blase doesn't know what to do.

I mean... 567 Cont.You see, Katherine...I feel terrible. His Italian accent is no longer in use and it makes Katherine ,just a tiny bit nervous.My name is Dave Blase.Nothing. It's just a name. I made it all up. I was born in Bloomington. I went to Bloomington High. I was the treasurer of the Latin Club and head of the Ushers for our assembly programs...I...I'm what you call 'a cutter.'

He takes the bike from Mike and starts wheeling it away. He gets on it and rides it into the garage. The guys look at each other. NOISE is HEARD coming from the garage.What're you doing here?

This will be the first time nobody's going to ask us to write a theme about how we spent our summer.When you're sixteen they call it sweet sixteen. When you're eighteen you get to drink, see dirty movies and vote. But what the hell do you do when you're nineteen.My dad says Jesus never went further than fifty miles from his home. Mike is skipping down the rocks toward the water, taking clothes off as he does. The rest follow.Who's swimming? I'm taking a leak. Moocher and Mike splash water at him and swim away.You know what I'd like to be?A cartoon of some kind. Man, X that'd be great.

That'd be great..I don't know. I think I have a dumb heredity. What's your excuse, Mike? Mike hits him hard on the arm. Cyril winces. Mike stands up. He makes sure they're all watching and dives in. The guys talk as they follow his progress.I .wouldn't mind thinking I was s omebody myself. All three of them stand up.I've never seen anyone dive off from there.This hole! This quarry hole is mine!Going to college must do'something 'to girls' tits. Just look at them. Campussies and sororititties. - Hi, there. What's your major? The Girls look up and kind of sneer.I wonder what it's like to kiss a coed. I wonder about it a lot. Ahead of Mike's car we see two Guys and two Girls playing Frisbee. They are standing on the lawns and throwing the Frisbee to each other across the street. Mike's car is moving slowly forward when an ill-thrown Frisbee lands on the street. Mike sees it and speeds up. A Girl is running to get it but Mike gets there first and runs over it. Dave gets a quick look at the Girl as she stops\"suddenly to keep from getting hit. The two college Guys run out and give' Mike the finger. He sees them in the rearview mirror.Besides, you've humiliated them enough. In ancient Japan when you ran over a samurai's Frisbee he had to commit suicide. Just as he laughs Mike shifts the car in reverse. The two Guys and Girls are standing in the middle of the road. The Guys are coming forward thinking Mike's going to stop, but Mike has no intention of stopping. The Girls and the Guys split as Mike's car roars between them. Once again Dave catches a fleeting glimpse of the Girl. Having scattered them, Mike makes a U-turn and drives away in the direction he came from. Cont.Are your parents asking you 'what you're going to do?I sure miss playing basketball. I got depressed as hell when my athlete's foot and jock itch went away. I was sure I'd get a basketball scholarship. My dad was sure I wouldn't. And when I didn't he was real understanding. He loves to do that. Be understanding when I fail. 'That's all right, Cyril, I understand.' He even bought me a guitar because he was sure I'd never learn to play it.You going to go to college?Maybe I'll take it too and flunk it. My dad's birthday is comingTalk to him Dave!He's getting a job! Yes, a job!Don't go, Mooch! They only let you out on weekends and national holidays!Don't forget your toothbrush.

The Cop goes into the cafe, As soon as he does Mike acts tough again. Cont.That's funny. Me too. Both of them feel a little guilty. Mike pretends he doesn't care.Yeah. Damn right.Don't you worry. I'll make this catgut meow.Play it, Cyril!0oops. If I were a cartoon, I'd go: HELP. And you'd see my tonsils wiggling in the back. He starts to run. Rod and his friends run after him.It wax dark. All I can tell you for sure is that they all wore Brut aftershave and smelled of Lavoris. XJust walking.It was this Mercedes convertible. Cont.Chief Mike plenty brave...but I say this: We rednecks are few. Paleface college students are many. I counsel peace. Mike grabs him.I guess. Mike shifts the car into first and waits for an opening to make a U-turn.We can't go in there.I can't get it out. College rids are looking at them. It's obvious who they are. Mike is leading. the way but even he's feeling out of place.My finger can't breathe[ As some busty Coeds go past him:Hi, what's your major? They enter the long part of the L-shaped room.And what's your major?That's a nice major...Sosh.Oops. I feel like that cartoon again. A bunch of Rod's cronies sitting nearby-laughs. They crowd in around the cutters. Cyril and Moocher look at Mike for guidance. Mike is on the spot. It's not that he's afraid of a fight, it's just that he's on a foreign turf.I...I don't think so.The funniest part is that tough-guy Mike didn't get a punch in. You should've been there.Are you going to see Katherine.,They're going to race.Not much longer.

He finds it unbearable to watch him chew. Cont.Speaking of flies...there's a helluva lot of flies following you into the house.Well in English it's a pest. And speaking of pests... Mrs. Blase senses an argument.Yeah, so what. I've lived fifty years without ever getting a trophy.No, never, and what's more... Dave interrupts.Don't do thatl How many times...There'-s that ity music again. X I'm going to have it out with him now. He goes to Dave's room carrying the trophy with him. Mrs. Blase follows him a few steps and stops. She waits... listening. She is apprehensive. She wants to follow and help Dave out but she stays behind wringing her hands. Mr. Blase reappears looking quite stunned. He's holding the trophy in one hand along his side.His legs, Evelyn. He's shaving X his legs. I saw him. His legs.It gets thirty miles to a gallon, X of course the mileage you get may vary. It's a beaut, right? Right. You sure know how to pick them. Frankly this is the best car on the lot. Quality product.Those college kids aren't so smart. I sold one of my worst cars to one of them today. They're not so smart. It's a good thing that Dave didn't... Cont.What's this?That's ity food! I don't want no X ity food!I know ity food when I hear it. X All those -- ini foods. Zucchini ...Fettuccini...I want some American food. I want French. fries, da=it. The cat jumps up on the table.He's back. XI want an answer, Evelyn. What're we going to do with him?That's not funny, Evelyn.I'm afraid to talk to him. I'm afraid to look at him. I'm afraid if I did, I'd see his eyes twirling like pinwheels. Mrs. Blase brings the fries.I can't eat while that noise is on. He gets up and heads toward Dave's room. Dave appears dressed for riding. They cross paths. Mrs. Blase goes to wash the pan in the sink. Dave sees the French fries on - X the table. He sits down and starts eating them. The music stops. Mrs. Blase turns around and sees Dave eating the French fries. She wants to say something. Mr. Blase reappears and sees Dave eating his fries.What are you doing? Evelyn.What are you doing, Evelyn?I'm having a nightmare.Like hell you will. I'm j us t visiting. But if I wanted to come back I could pick up where I left off. The entrance to the shop draws him forward. A couple of the Cutters accompany him. He takes half of a sandwich from one of them. It's lunch hour at the shop and the old instincts are coming back.He's borrowing a cigarette from a Cutter, lighting it. He's tired and out of breath. The man moves on to do his work. Mr, Blase smokes his cigarette looking on...in,love with this place and yet out of place. A Man is shouting at him. He can't hear. He finally hears him.You...eh...you waxed the floor, eh? Looks nice,Oh, damn. You know what? I put premium gas in this baby by mistake. It hates expensive.gas. He tries to laugh about this, but nobody in the car is .buying the story.I should have hit him when I had my chance.' He'd be dead now. No more worries.Collegel So he can thumb his diploma at me.That's because he hasn't been to collegeI Besides he's probably too stupid to get in.I don't care. It's my house. He' X doesn't understand English anyway.One, more. And make it a double.I've had enough'of your lips that's for sure. I said I want a double and I want a double 'on the double.' Nancy looks at the OWNER of the place. He nods to her to do as he says. Nancy then goes and picks up the phone. X Dials. Cont.Leave me alone.I'm just tired of it, Evelyn. It= tired of worrying about him. Who'd hire a guy like that? He'll wind up a bum.. An Italian bum.I don't want him selling used cars.Who says it's good enough for me?Damn right it's good enough for me. But...I don't need help. Besides...he'd ruin me if I hired him. A weirdo like that... It's clear that Mr. Blase has higher hopes for Dave which he has difficulty admitting even to himself.I want to talk to youlYou know what you're going to dolI see nothing. Where're you going to get a job.Car wash! Car washl You should've died when you had the German Measles. No son of mine is going to wash cars.,Hey, no whistling. You're a shag boy, so- shag. If I wanted whistling, I'd get a bird.Exhausted?Good. You might as well get used to it. From now on it's more of the same. Let's go home.Hell no.I don't care if the second coming's coming.No. N-double 'o' NO-0.You stay out of this.What guarantee?On paper? Can I see it on paper?I don't remember giving my word. Now get this car out of here. Dave appears next to him. Cont.What? Who're you? He starts to push real hard.No, I don't feel lucky to be alive. I feel lucky I'm not dead. There's a difference. The door opens and Dave limps inside. He looks terrible. Blood is still caked up on his left leg.Dad. I'll tell you how I'm feeling. I've had nightmares all night that everybody I ever sold a car to is going to come in and ask for a refund. And you'll be there handing out the checks. One for you...and one for you... Cont.Well, now you know. So, where's the trophy?What? What is this? Look ...you don't have to be this miserable. A little is all I asked for.And. what're you doing? Mrs. Blase shakes her head, but she shakes it in a certain way that makes Mr. Blase a little troubled. He looks at her again.Dave.Just one.. Don't tell mother. (looking at theI was one fine stonecutter... Mike's dad...Moocher's, Cyrii's ...we all were. Well, Cyril's dad...Ah, never mind. The thing is. I loved it. I was young, slim and strong and damn proud of my work. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 .and the buildings went up...and when they were finished...damnest thing happened. It was like the buildings were X too good for us. Nobody told us that. But we just felt uncomfortable. Even now. I'd like to be able to stroll through the campus and look at the limestone but I feel out of place. I suppose you guys still go swimming in the quarries. 567 Cant.So, all you get from my twenty years of work is the holes we left behind.I didn't either when 'I was your age. But...Eh, Cyril's Dad says he took that college exam.Don't do me any favors, eh. What, you afraid.Well, you took the exam. You did all right, eh?Well, that's...that's good. Your mom... (pauses, wants to say something,There goes the neighborhood.If you eat so much, Moocher, how come you're so damn small?Well, I go back to work tomorrow.I've got work to do. That's all. Besides,-there might be another metabolism feed around here.Yes, I might, and your mom might be- a mother and you might be a brother. That way I keep it all in the family.The'next. word might be your last, kid. Dave looks at him. Then he looks at his mother. She smiles. Dave looks back at his father. Dave jumps up and hugs his mother.Of course I must. You think I have any choice?They don't need pep.. I need pep. Go ahead...Give it to them. Mrs. Blase opens a kitchen drawer and takes out some folded T-shirts.Thassa my boy! His car is running and he floors it while it idles and hits the horn again, grabbing the wheel as if he were in a race himself.Ev...He sure tried. Even the announcer said so.

He says the Italians are the best bike racers in'the world and he...Re did win his bicycle and he was quite sickly 'til he started racing around and in three yearsI thought you didn't want him to go to college.But most of the quarries have shut down.But there aren't any jobs. 567 Cont.He's young.He says Italian families stay together,I know.

I suppose we could strangle him while he's asleep.Why don't you talk to him.The only reason I'm giving you these French fries is because you promised to calm down. Don't expect to get them again. Mr. Blase is still annoyed by Dave's music.Oh, my God. What's the matter?It's his heart. It's those damn French fries he ate.I won't have any heart attack food in my house. That was God's warning to us. If anybody dies around here it won't be on my conscience.These are all the food the doctor said you can't have... and they're all going out.
