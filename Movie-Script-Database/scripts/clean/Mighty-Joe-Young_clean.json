Check the pictures.I was right, wasn't I?I told you so.Goodnight, Kweli.Mommy, can I...Mom!Mom, there were men, they...He's scared.I... I promise.Joe! Stop!Joe...... drop him.Looks like he just has.He's walking so soon. Joe should have dropped him harder.He can't be trusted. He's an outsider.And what did you tell him?I'll be the judge of that.Hey, handsome. How are you?What were you thinking yesterday, letting those men see you? Don't do that again, okay? Please. Please.One. Two. Three. Four...... seven, eight, nine, ten. Ready or not, here I come!!Oh, my God! I can't find Joe. Where's Joe?Come out, come out... wherever you are!I found you!Bye-bye, Joe!Joe! It's okay.Now get out of here, Joe. Run.Run, Joe. Run!Anything broken?Hmm -- it looks okay. I think it's still working.Well -- I can fix that.You. You're the problem. That's the second time I've stopped you from being ripped in two -- and next time I'm just going to watch. Understand?So?By keeping people like you off the mountain.You're not helping anybody here. You're just making matters worse.This mountain will be crawling with people, thanks to you. You go back to wherever you're from, put the word out...'Here' is Joe's home. And 'here' is where he must live. He doesn't have a choice.Just what Joe needs. A cage.But he won't be free.I found this in the forest this morning. Thought maybe you dropped it and might want it back.Poaching is illegal! Get off this mountain!My mother would have been proud of what I did today.She risked hers -- why shouldn't I risk mine? I'm just doing what I promised, and I promised to protect Joe. And I'm going to do everything I can to stop the poachers...They don't want him. They won't let him come.He needs me.Leaving?You think it will work?Okay!Okay we'll go.Me and Joe. To that place of yours in California. What?! You didn't think you could take him without me, did you?No. I am completely unsure about this. But I'll do it. On one condition.I'm in charge of Joe.Done? Just like that? That was way too easy.No, I'm not.... or a fool.I don't shake. That's not how we make pacts around here.You have to endure a bite from a Makiki spider.You'll have a high fever and hallucinations. You'll say things -- lots of things. We'll hear what's in your heart. Then, if your intentions prove true, the pact is made.That's right.That's right. Well?Good. Maybe you're not a fool after all.I don't know what else to do.There are more cars on this road than I've seen in my entire life, total.Think he's okay back there? I think he's okay back there.You think he's okay back there?Sorry. I'm a little tense. Yeah. I think he's okay back there.So this is L.A. It all looks the same. How do you know where you are?Ha ha.Hello. It's a privilege to meet you both.Coming, Joe! Hold on! I think he'd like to come out now -- if you don't mind.We won't need any of that.I'll take it from here.Come on, Joe. Come on, big guy.Come on, ya big baby. Come on back. Do I have to come in there and get you myself?That's it. That-a-boy.Hold on -- I'm going in with him.But you said -- I'm in charge of Joe.'I'm in charge of this facility.' Who is that guy? I bet that man hasn't spent one night outside in his entire life.You said I was going to be in charge of Joe. I should be sleeping down there, with him, not in this... this... cage.What's wrong with this window? That's all it opens? That's all?This is wrong. This is all wrong... Please, fix it, or do something...Thank you.What is that noise?Harry! Jump out from behind the tree!Jump out and say 'You found me!'He's playing hide and seek.Okay, where are you? Come out, big guy! Where'd he go? There you are!He's playing! Did you see?He likes it here! Isn't it great?Too bad it's always so cold -- somebody broke my window.I know! This is working out -- better than I expected.Where you going?No kidding? When do you leave?Oh -- of course.Say hello to Africa for me.Harry -- see what's in that cart? That's all we have left of the lobelia leaves for Joe. Did you by any chance place that new order I asked for?I wouldn't be surprised if you forgot, considering you have so much on your mind.Thank you so much.You're back early. What happened? Run out of humvees to crash?Really? And why is that?No thanks. I still don't want to leave Joe.What's to see? Beach is that way, mountains are that way, Mexico's that way, Canada's that way...I'll brush my hair if you take a shower.So this is what you call a good meal in a fine restaurant?Don't point that smile at me. I'm still mad at you for taking off and leaving me here all alone.Uh-huh...That's right. Me and Joe. Just like always.Never had anyone to bring home anyway. All that stuff -- I don't even know what it's like.Whatever you want to call it. Being in love.Oh yeah? How's that?Fever? Really. How high?Interesting. Hallucinations with that?Aaah!Come on!No.Please, Mr. Baker -- I wouldn't be asking you to postpone the benefit unless I thought there was something really wrong with Joe. And I do.I swear to you, Joe's still not himself -- he's nervous and agitated. He shouldn't be exposed to a crowd of strangers right now. If you would only delay the party a few more...No. It's too soon.Oh! Excuse me.Yes...?How wonderful to meet you. What are you doing here?Raha? A preserve?I'll look forward to it.Tell me the truth -- do I look stupid in this? Everyone is staring at me.Very funny.Hey, Joe. I'm right here. You hear me? Good boy. Take it easy, Joe. We don't want to scare anybody, do we?My God. What's wrong with him?No -- let me stop him.Joe... look at me. Over here, big guy.I knew something was wrong with him.Joe never would have hurt all those people unprovoked... something must have got to him.About what?In there? Harry, look at him. He's depressed, he won't eat. If he stays in there, he'll die within days.Listen, Harry, either you tell them you're getting Joe out of there or I will!He's not a killer!That's it? You're not going to do anything?I need your help.Come on, Joe. We're leaving. Let's get you out of here.He didn't believe you.You're not such a big coward after all.I promise.You coming to the airport, or...?Well -- if you're ever in Botswana, come by and take me out to a good meal in a fine restaurant. That is, if you're not afraid to tell Joe that you'll get me home by...Please! Be careful...My mother was brave.I'm sorry. What happened?Murdering bastard!Joe! Get out!What have I done? Mother, oh, God, what have I done... Do you know who they are?Joe! Joe!No! He's not dangerous! You're dangerous! You're dangerous!Yes I did.They're going to shoot him.Look.That's where he'll go. He'll think that's me calling him.He's gotta be here. Do you see him?What was that?Joe! Joe!!Come on, Joe. Come on.Joe got Strasser. He was trying to kill me.Joe?Joe!Stop! He's not dangerous, please...Look!He'll save your boy.That's right, Joe -- that's right, big guy. That was a big fall but you're okay, aren't you? You're tough. You're so tough. Yes you are. Yes you are.Somewhere safe? Where is that?No. I don't think so. Not unless you have a few million dollars on you to buy him a home somewhere.Dear Cecily: I promised to write you when Joe was settled and now I finally can. We finally dedicated the Joe Young Wildlife Park last week and it was one of the happiest days of my life. At last I have kept my promise to my mother.Joe seems so happy here. I know he feels that he's safe.He and Gregg have become good friends. They even play together. And that jealous rivalry they had? It's all gone.Well... almost all gone.It's been a long journey getting to this place, but Joe is finally home.

No. Why would I do that?Gimme those.Sounds.Yup.You're a beauty.Okay, set him free.Because I'm only keeping this.Put the cat down... now.Don't anybody move.Come on!! We're going after him!Three times your price. Triple your fee.Herd him towards me! I gotta get close.Real close.Experienced trackers, my ass!No, we don't want to...Hold the wheel!Pindi! Look out!Get those men down the mountain. They need help.Oh, wow.Where am I?Strange, I don't feel lucky.You're an injury behind. The kicker was getting dropped on my head by N'gai Zamu.Think that's funny? You should try it?No, he's a giant gorilla with a mean backhand. There was also a woman...Out in the jungle. She saved my life. A beautiful woman.No. I never remember my dreams.Don't need one.Damnit.Oh boy.Nobody better try and tell me I imagined this.No... no. I think I'm... oh.Oh -- good.Hey -- wait a minute!Hang on a second -- what's the problem?You saved me. I'm grateful. Now I just want to talk to you -- Miss Young.I know who you are. I read all your mother's work. Books... notes... everything I could get a hold of.So it's why I'm here.She knew about Joe? Did she have a theory on him? How old is he? I can't believe you kept him a secret all these years. How'd you manage that?You got this all wrong. I want to help you.How's that?The word is out. It's done. I'm not the only one who saw him, remember? Rare animals mean big money and Joe's as rare as they come. It's going to be tough to protect him here. Maybe impossible.That's not true. Place that sent me could take care of Joe. They got the facilities...Not a cage, a preserve. A place where he'll be free from poachers, free from land development...How long do you think Joe will stay free here? I'm telling you there's gonna be a hunt starting on this mountain tomorrow. And I don't expect they'll give it up until one of them bags the prize. You should think about it.I'm gonna head up the mountain. See if I can throw some of the poachers off the trail.Not for long. Just trying to buy you a little time, that's all. With more of these bastards arriving every hour, I suggest you get Joe as deep into the jungle as you can -- as fast as you can.Okay what?We?You're sure about this?Name it.Done.You're not a very trusting soul are you, Miss Young?Tough, isn't it? Trying to measure me up -- decide if I'm a fraud...Well, I'd like to know if you're a bona fide lunatic or just a mixed up monkey girl but -- but I guess we'll have to take our chances and figure it out as we go along.Come on, Jill. Trust it. You'll be in charge of Joe. Let's shake on it.Alright, how do you make pacts around here?A what?A spider bite and hallucinations?Then you'll trust me and let me have Joe?Well... I think... that's the biggest load of crap I've ever heard.Get your things together. Fast. We're getting out of here as soon as we can.Makiki spider.Welcome to L.A.Don't worry. He's doing fine.Good. Thanks for the update.Beach is that way, mountains are that way, Mexico's that way, Canada's that way. Don't worry about the rest -- you'll never see it through the smog.Maybe you better check and see if Joe's okay back there.Hello, Harry. Cecily.Let me introduce you to...Jill Young, Dr. Harry Ruben -- he run the place -- and Dr. Cecily Banks, who makes sure he doesn't screw it up.Harry? I think it's time you met Joe.Harry -- you and I made an agreement. The lady's in charge of Joe.She knows.Go on, Joe. Go on.Harry...Probably not.I'll do everything I can for you.I was coming to get you.Come on!What the hell is going on?Stop!Do it, Harry!I saw.It's great.What are you talking about?You've got an active imagination, Cecily.Like what you've done with the place.I just came by to tell you that I think Joe looks real good out there...... and that I'm hitting the road.Back to Africa. For a couple of months.Now.It's the job, y'know. Always on the road. It's what I like, anyway -- can't stand to be caged up...You and Joe will be okay...Yeah. Well...Lobelia leaves. Should have called me in Africa. I would have brought 'em back for ya.Nice to see you running the place, Jill.No -- just wanted to get back.Guess I missed Harry.They want me to show my face at the fundraiser tomorrow night... and I guess I got my mind fixed on a good meal in a fine restaurant. Thought you might like to join me.'Still'? Haven't you been out of here yet?Come on. Have dinner with me, Jill. You won't find a better excuse to brush your hair.Deal.Yeah.I'm sorry -- I had things I had to do...Besides, you weren't all alone. You had Joe.Growing up with him around -- what's it been like for you? I mean -- most guys are afraid of girls' fathers. I can just see a guy telling Joe he'll get you home by midnight...All what 'stuff'?Well -- it's kinda like getting bit by a makiki spider.You'll get a kind of a fever...Pretty high.Oh yeah... and you'll, uh -- find yourself saying things. Lots of things.Do you know what's wrong with him?Cecily -- you're ravishing. Harry -- you got shrimp on your shirt.Brilliant.They're not staring at you. They're staring at that... uh... banana tower.We've got to bring him down. I'm going for the tranq guns.What do you think happened out there?Something. Or someone.Well this wasn't in the brochure, was it?I promised you wouldn't be put in a cage. I'm sorry, Joe. I helped put you here. And now I'm going to do everything I can to get you out.You got it.We're conservancy doctors. Do me a favor -- stay here and guard the door.Officer, you don't want to point that gun at him, believe me.I think I better stay here and keep people away from that bunker. Give you a head start before they realize he's gone.Take care of her for me, will ya?Five. How many minutes do you give it before we're both lookin' through the want ads?What're you guys doing here so late?Where did you find this?What two guys?I know.Come on. Let's go get him back.He couldn't have gotten far.She didn't mean that.Better cool it, baby.Not if we find him first.Let's follow them.Any idea where he might've headed?Go find Joe, get him out of here. I'm gonna see if I can help.Don't be scared. Climb down my back.Come on.I know. I just hope they do.Stop!Don't shoot him.It's going to tip! Everyone back up!We've got to get him checked out.
