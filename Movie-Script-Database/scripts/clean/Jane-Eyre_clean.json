{"Jane-Eyre": {"JANE": {"raw_line": "Shelter. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 4.I have no strength to go.But I must die if I am turned away.God help me. I will die.I - I am J -What do you want?I have done nothing wrong. Master Reed.I wasn't aware it was yours.Wicked and cruel - you are a slaver - a murderer -I hate you John Reed. I hate you - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 8.Bessie!There was a light.No - Aunt, have pity -Please - I cannot bear it -I shall be killed -Have mercy, have mercy I beg you -They go to hell.A pit full of fire.No sir.I must keep in good health and not die.You are not fit to associate with me!You said I was a liar. Well I am not. If I was, I should say that I loved you and I don't. I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except John Reed. He is a liar, not I.I'll never call you Aunt again as long as I live and if anyone asks how I liked you I'll say that the very thought of you makes me sick. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 14.I'll remember how you thrust me back into the Red Room and locked me there to my dying day. Even when you knew it was haunted and I begged to be let out. People think you are good but you are bad and hard-hearted and I'll let everyone at Lowood know what you have done!Deceit is not my fault!My Uncle Reed is in heaven and can see all that you do and think; so can my mother and father. They know how you hate me and wish me dead. They can see. They see everything you do and they will judge you, Mrs Reed.Don't scold me Bessie. I know you dislike me -You don't show it. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 15.Jane Eyre.My name is Jane Elliott...No one.Yes sir.Mr Rivers, you and you sisters have done me a great service, the greatest man can do - you have rescued me from death.I'll tell you as much as I can. I am an orphan; brought up a dependent; educated in a charity school where I passed six years as a pupil and two as a teacher. I left a year since to become a private governess -A good situation, where I remained until...Do you?You're not working at present?I am very sorry to hear it.I... It was a catastrophe.I am free from any blame, sir. I was happy.Because that is not my name. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 18.Because I must not ever be found.I'd appreciate it if you called me Jane. It is my own name.I trust I will not be eating long at your expense, Mr Rivers.I wish to work, sir. Show me how to work or how to seek work; that's all I ask.With all my heart, sir.Most thorough.You're not allowed to speak to me. I must be shunned.He said I was a liar.I am not a liar!How do you bear it? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 22.Being struck.If she hit me I would get that birch from her hand and break it under her nose.I have always been excluded and alone and hated. Miss Abbott used to call me an ugly little toad.What?What do you mean?Is that true?Angels?Why?Why ever not?Can he not do God's work here?In one thing you are fortunate.You have each other.Helen.You're cold.Back to your father?Then where?No...No...Then he must save you.I won't leave you.No, no, no -Have you something for me to do?That's Miss Temple on her wedding day. She was my teacher; a great influence on me. Under her guidance I became a teacher too.No, Mary, please -Mr Rivers, I wondered if you had yet heard of any work that I could do.I shan't mind what I do.Mr Rivers, I thank you heartily and I accept with all my heart.I will save them until they are wanted. They will keep.Yes. Excuse me.Are you Mrs Fairfax?Am I to have the pleasure of meeting Miss Fairfax tonight?Miss Fairfax - my pupil?Who is Mr Rochester?I thought Thornfield Hall belonged to you.Forgive me - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 32.OH -Thank you.What a beautiful house.Where did you live Adele, before you came to Thornfield?Her mother has passed away.Well - that would be lovely. Adele is going to show us her accomplishments.Who's there?Who sleeps up here?I heard someone.A laugh. Someone laughed.I'm not in need of tea, thank you.Oh, Mrs Fairfax, no. I'm so thankful to be at Thornfield. Please don't think I'm so ungrateful as to be discontented.I wish a woman could have action in her life, like a man. It agitates me to pain that the sky- line over there is ever our limit. I long sometimes for a power of vision that would overpass it. If I could behold all I imagine... I've never seen a city, never spoken with men. I've never even seen a town of any size. And I fear my whole life will pass, without ever having...Can I do anything, sir?Are you injured, sir?If you are hurt and want help I can fetch someone from the village. I'm on my way there to post a letter.Thornfield Hall.Mr Rochester's.No, I've never seen him.I am the governess, sir. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 39.No.Oh?I have to change?But all my dresses are the same.Thank you.Yes, sir.Pardon?I was brought up by my Aunt, Mrs Reed of Gateshead, in a house far finer than this. At ten years old I went to Lowood school where I received as good an education as I could hope for. I have no tale of woe, sir.Dead.No.She cast me off, sir.Because I was burdensome and she disliked me.Yes.Eight years.Yes sir.Out of my head.Yes sir.The evening star.What for? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 44.Why?How, sir?No sir. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 46.I was too plain; I beg your pardon.Mr Rochester, it was a blunder. I ought to have replied that beauty is of little consequence -You have other qualities, sir.Not at all.What about, sir?How can I introduce a subject when I don't know what'll interest you? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 47.Yet you'd command me to speak?I don't think you have a right to command me just because you're older. Your claim to superiority depends on the use you've made of your time and experience.There are few masters who'd trouble to enquire whether their paid subordinates were hurt by their commands.I'd never mistake informality for insolence, sir. One, I rather like. The other, nothing free born should ever submit to - even for a salary.You've clearly not spent much time in the company of schoolgirl governesses. I'm the same plain kind of bird as all the rest, with my couple of accomplishments and my common tale of woe.How?Are you a villain then, sir?Then you'll degenerate still more.I'm reminding you of your own words; remorse is the poison of life.I don't know. To speak truth, I don't understand you at all.Sir, I find the conversation has got out of my depth.I'm not afraid.I've simply no wish to talk nonsense.Just as it turns to come down - that's when you hit it.Mademoiselle has got to rest.Have mercy, Adele. Play with Pilot for a while.Is our game disturbing you, sir?To fall in love, sir?Does it?Were you dashed to pieces, Mr Rochester?But you took her on?Who's there?Wake up! Wake up! Sir!It is I, Jane Eyre, sir.For heaven's sake get up. Somebody has plotted something; you must find out who. I'll light the lamp - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 54.I heard a laugh outside my door loud enough to wake me. I opened it. Someone was running towards the third floor.And a candle was left burning in the middle of the floor. Shall I fetch Mrs Fairfax, sir?Then I'll wake John and Martha.Only the candle on the ground. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 55.Yes.There's a woman who sews here; Grace Poole - She laughs in that way, I think.BUT -Yes, sir. Good-night.You said I should go.What am I to do then, sir?There is no debt.Good night then, sir.I'm cold.What's happened here?I did. I heard a strange laugh.I was not.Has Mr Rochester not sent for us today?Oh?Nothing. Speak in English, please.Thank you, girls. You may go.Not at all. I'm getting on very well.I hardly have time to notice it.A few months ago I had nothing. I was wretched. Now I have a home and work; free and honest. I wonder at the goodness of God and at the generosity of my friends.It's what I mean to do.Thank you.Why were you intensely miserable?You could have been happy.Yes.What's the matter?May I assist you, Mrs Fairfax?Excuse me, miss.What is it, darling?Not me, surely.He was being polite.May I present Miss Adele Varens?I am tired, sir.You seemed engaged, sir.Teaching Adele.I am well.Can I help you sir?Turn them out of the room sir, if I could.I should care nothing about it.For the sake of any friend who deserved it.It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir.Will Grace Poole stay here now?But sir -Yes sir.Yes sir.I'd do anything for you sir, anything that was right.Excuse me, sir.If you please, I want leave of absence for a week or two.This is from my old nurse, Bessie. She says my cousin John Reed is dead. He ruined himself and has committed suicide. The news has so shocked his mother, my Aunt, that it's brought on a stroke.She's been asking for me. I parted from her very badly and I can't neglect her wishes now.Sir, it seems you are soon to be married.Adele should go to school.And I must seek another situation. I intend to advertise. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 75.And sir? Forgive me but I have had no wages as yet.Fifteen pounds.That's too much.I cannot.Now you owe me five.Not a whit, sir. You are not to be trusted at all.Bessie... I'm not too late? How is Mrs Reed?Shall I see her now?Aunt Reed? It is Jane Eyre. You sent for me, and here I am.Why do you hate her so?I am Jane Eyre, Aunt.We are alone.Please, don't think of it -'Madam, will you have the goodness to send me the address of my niece, Jane Eyre. I desire her to come to me at Madeira. Fortune has blessed my endeavours and as I am childless I wish to adopt her and bequeath her at my death whatever I may have to leave. Yours, John Eyre, Madeira.'This is dated three years ago. Why did I never hear of it?Forgive me.I would have loved you if you'd let me.Please, let us be reconciled.Then love me or hate me as you will. You have my full and free forgiveness. Now ask for God's - and be at peace.My mother.Why ever was I so afraid?My dear uncle, some years ago, my Aunt Reed mistakenly informed you that I had died. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 79.I am writing to tell you that I am very much alive and living at Thornfield Hall, where I am currently governess to the ward of Mr Edward Fairfax Rochester -I have been with my aunt sir, who is dead.Thank you Mr Rochester. I'm strangely glad to get back again to you. Wherever you are is my home.Then we must accept it. He'll soon bring home his bride.I'll be sad to leave it.Have you found me a new situation, sir?Connaught?It is a long way away, sir.From here. From you.I wish I could. I wish I'd never come here. I love Thornfield - I've lived a full life here. I've not been trampled on or petrified or buried with inferior minds. I've talked face to face with what I reverence, with what I delight in. I've known you Mr Rochester -Because of your bride.But you will have.Then I must go.Do you think I could stay to become nothing to you? Am I an automaton, a machine without feelings? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 82.Do you think that because I am poor, obscure, plain and little that I am soulless and heartless?I have as much soul as you and full as much heart. I'm not speaking to you through mortal flesh. It's my spirit that addresses your spirit as if we'd passed through the grave and stood at God's feet, equal - as we are.Let me go.I'm a free human being with an independent will, which I now exert to leave you.Are you mocking me?Entirely. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 83.Not a whit.Your bride is Miss Ingram -Are you in earnest?You wish me to be your wife?You love me.Then sir, I will marry you.I must go.Good night.Yes.Am I a monster? Is it so impossible that Mr Rochester should love me?Thank you. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 85.It is I, Jane Eyre sir.It can never be, sir. Human beings were not meant to enjoy complete happiness on this earth. It's too much like a fairy tale.Oh, no sir -I don't want jewels -Then you won't know me. I'll not be Jane Eyre any longer but an ape in a harlequin's jacket. Put them away.I'm naturally proud. And hard and flinty. You ought to know what sort of bargain you've made while you've still got time to rescind it. I want only one thing from you, Mr Rochester.Your regard.Adele?Adele, is that you? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 87.I'm afraid.It was not Grace Poole.I was not asleep.I know what I saw.Thank you.I cannot.I'm tired and sick. I need some water.Much better, sir. I shall be well again soon.All is changed, sir. I must change too.Sir - you speak of her with hate - it is cruel. She cannot help being mad.I do.No.You can't.I must leave you, sir.I do love you - But I mustn't show it or speak it ever again. I must begin a new existence - strange scenes among strange faces. I must part from you.You have a wife already.I earnestly pity you, sir.Do not say it -STOP -I can not.How?You once told me that hiring a mistress is the next worse thing to buying a slave.I would not degrade you by having you live with a slave.I do.I do.I would.It would be to obey you. I care for myself. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 100.The more alone, the more friendless, unsustained I am, the more I must respect myself -I must listen to myself -Let me go -God help me!Edward.Mr St John - What on earth brings you away from your hearth on a night like this? Has anything happened? There's no bad news I hope?You are recklessly rash about your own health.Why are you come?I mean on a night like this -Please...Mr Rivers! -Since you know so much, perhaps you can tell me how he is.Mr Rochester; how is he?The solicitor - Mr Briggs - does he have any news of Mr Rochester?What does he want with me?What?How much am I worth?Twenty thousand pounds?There must be some mistake. It's two thousand, surely.Why did Mr Briggs write to you?Yes.St John Eyre -Your mother was my father's sister?My uncle John was your uncle John?So you, Diana and Mary -Oh, I am glad! - I am glad!Of no moment? You have sisters and maybe don't care for a cousin but I have nobody. I have been alone, always. And now three relations are born into my world full grown. Oh, I am glad. You, who saved my life -Write to Diana and Mary. Tell them to hand in notice and come home. They will have five thousand each and so will you.Don't put me out of patience, cousin. I am rational enough. Twenty thousand divided equally between the nieces and nephews of our uncle, gives five to each.And you cannot imagine - family - I never had a home. I never had brothers and sisters -You are not reluctant to own me, are you?Di, you are very provoking.Am I not being useful?Beyond to what?So soon? -I'm not fit for it. I have no vocation.St John have mercy. I feel my mind shrinking -I used to long for a life of action, to overleap the horizon, to move in the world of men. Maybe God is giving me this. And what is there for me here? Pain and longing for what can't be. I don't know how long I would survive in India. My frame isn't strong. But I'll go with you, if I may go free.You and I had better not marry.Because I am your sister.Conditionally - as your curate. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 110.I must have my heart and mind free, my own self to turn to. I couldn't become part of you -Enough of love?St John, I scorn your idea of love. I scorn the counterfeit sentiment you offer and I scorn you when you offer it!Forgive me but the very name of love is an apple of discord between us. My dear cousin, please abandon your scheme of marriage.Do not be angry with me please. It makes me wretched. I want us to be friends. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 111.I cannot come as your wife.If I were to marry you, you'd kill me. You're killing me now.You'd kill me without drawing any blood or receiving on your conscience any stain of crime.You'd experience no pain - but I tell you it would kill me!Because I would inevitably come to conceive love for you, because you are so talented and good, because there is such grandeur in your look. You wouldn't want this strange and torturing love; if I showed it you would find it unbecoming. And my lot would be wretched.You're a good man, but you forget the feelings of little people. We'd better keep out of your way lest you trample us. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 112.If I were sure; if I were certain -Oh God, what is it?I am coming!Wait for me!Where are you?They sent me from the inn. I've been up at the house -Is he dead?Tell me - please -He stayed at Thornfield?Why?I had dreaded worse. I'd dreaded he was mad.Where is he?Martha is in the kitchen, sir.Pilot knows me. Will you have some more water? I've spilt half the glass.And her voice.My Edward, I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out. I am come back to you.I've been with good people; far better than you, quite more refined and exalted.And I'm an independent woman. My uncle in Madeira died and left me five thousand pounds -I'm here. I'm home. I am where I love best.I conscientiously believe so, sir.But I see that you're turning into a lion. It's time someone undertook to rehumanise you.I know.And the worst of it is, I'm in danger of loving you too well for this, and making too much of you.Very. But you always were, you know.", "clean_line": "shelter jane eyre adapted moira buffini march strength die turned away god help die want wrong master reed wasn aware wicked cruel slaver murderer hate

-Hellfire.Pilot, get down! GET DOWN I SAY!Get back.Mesrour. Mesrour.Damnation.Where do you come from?Whose house is that?Do you know Mr Rochester?You're not a servant there...The governess. Deuce take me, I had forgotten.The governess.Have you got an umbrella I can use as a stick?Then try to get hold of his bridle and lead him to me.If you would be so kind...Perhaps it would be easier to bring me to the horse. Come here.Forgive me. I must beg of you to come here.Mesrour.Thank you. Now, make haste with your letter. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 40.Let her sit.I have examined Adele and I find you've taken great pains with her. She's not bright, she has no talents - yet in a short time she's made much improvement.You've been resident here three months?And from whence do you hail; what's your tale of woe?All governesses have a tale of woe; what's yours?Where are your parents?Do you remember them? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 42.And why are you not with Mrs Reed of Gateshead now?Why?Lowood; that's a charity school, isn't it?How long did you survive there?No tale of woe...Don't trouble yourself to give her a character. I'll judge for myself. She began by felling my horse.I have her to thank for this sprain.Adele has brought me these; are they yours? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 43.Where did you get your copies?That head I now see on your shoulders?Who's this?Why did you bewitch my horse?Ah, there she is...Take it away you genuine daughter of Paris and amuse yourself with disembowelling it.Miss Eyre. Sit there. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 45.I'm not fond of children.Nor do I particularly enjoy simple-minded old ladies. But you might suit me - if you would.By distracting me from the mire of my thoughts.Precisely.And that is how she charmed my English gold out of my English breeches pocket.Your gaze is very direct, Miss Eyre? D'you think me handsome?What fault do you find with me? I have all my limbs and all my FEATURES -Now you stick a knife under my EAR -Just so; other qualities... When I was your age I was a felling enough fellow. I might have been insulted then. You're blushing Miss Eyre.And though you're not pretty any more than I am handsome, I must say it becomes you. And now I see you're fascinated by the flowers on the rug.I'd like to draw you out. Come, speak to me.The choice of subject is entirely yours.The fact is, Miss Eyre, I don't wish to treat you like an inferior.Well I probably have a right to be a little abrupt and exacting on the grounds of my superiority in age. There must be twenty years between us and a century's advance in experience.I've made indifferent use of both. And this is why I sit, galled by my own thoughts - and order you to divert me. Are you very hurt by my tone of command?Oh yes... paid subordinate; I'd forgotten the salary. Well on that mercenary ground, will you consent to speak with me as my equal - without thinking that the request arises from insolence?Humbug. Most free-born things would submit to anything for a salary. But I mentally shake hands with you for your answer. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 48.Not three in three thousand schoolgirl governesses would have answered me as you've just done.I envy you.Your openness, your clear conscience, your unpolluted mind. If I were eighteen I think we truly would be equals. Nature meant me to be a good man, one of the better kind and as you see, I am not so.I'm a trite commonplace sinner, hackneyed in all the dissipations that the rich and worthless try to put on life. When I was your age, fate dealt me a blow. I was - cursed with a burden to carry through life. I lacked the wisdom to remain cool and I turned desperate. Dread remorse, Miss Eyre. It is the poison of life.And since happiness is denied me, I've a right to get pleasure in its stead. And I will get it, cost what it may.Are you preaching to me? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 49.But, Miss Eyre, if the pleasure I was seeking was sweet and fresh; if it was an inspiration; if it wore the robes of an angel of light... what then?My heart has long been a charnel house. Perhaps it'll transform into a shrine.You're afraid of me because I talk like a sphynx.Yes you are.If you did it would be in such a grave, quiet manner that I would mistake it for sense. Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre?Only rarely, perhaps. But you're not naturally austere, any more than I'm naturally vicious. I can see in you the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close set bars of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive. Were it but free, it would soar. Cloud high.On the contrary. I like your game. I like this cold, hard day. I like Thornfield.I've been arranging a point with my destiny, Miss Eyre. My destiny stood up there by that chimney, like one of the hags who appeared to Macbeth. 'You like Thornfield?' She said. 'Like it if you dare'. Well, I dare. It's felt like a plague house for years -But Thornfield is my home and I shall like it!Get back! Keep at a distance child, or go in!She's the daughter of an opera dancer, Celine Varens. Celine was a beauty and she professed to love me. Her ardour was so great that, ugly as I am, I believed myself her idol. So I installed in her in a hotel, gave her servants, gowns cashmeres, diamonds - in short, I was an idiot.You've never felt love, have you Miss Eyre? Your soul still sleeps.You're still floating gently in the stream of life, unaware of the rocks ahead waiting to dash you to pieces.Not by Celine. How can one ever truly love a woman one has paid for? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 52.It ended when I visited her unexpectedly one night and caught her with her handsome, charmless lover. I overheard her waxing lyrical on all my defects - she was mercenary, heartless, senseless. The whole intoxication fell away like a dream. I left her money to support the little French floweret over there, whom she swore blind was mine. I see no proof of my grim paternity in her features; I think Pilot is more like me than she.Some years later, I heard that Celine had abandoned the brat, disappeared to Italy and left it destitute. So I lifted it from the mud and slime of Paris and brought it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an English country garden. My one good work in a sea of countless sins.You listen, Miss Eyre, as if it was the most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his opera-mistresses to an inexperienced girl like you. Adele?Forgive me; for keeping Miss Eyre from your game for so long.Who's there?What in the name of all the elves in Christendom have you done with me?Light the lamp at your peril.What the deuce can she do?Not at all. Stay here. You're shivering.I have to go to the third floor. Don't make a sound. Sit there. I shan't be long.Did you see anything when you opened your chamber door?But you heard a laugh?Have you heard that laugh before?Just so. Grace Poole - you have guessed it. Well, you're no talking fool; please say nothing about this.I will account for this state of affairs. Go back to your room and say nothing.Is that how you're going to leave me?Jane, fire is a horrible death. You have saved my life. Don't walk past me as if we were strangers.At least... shake hands.I have a pleasure in owing you my life.I knew you would do me good in some way. I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you. Their expression did not - did not strike delight into my very inmost being so, for nothing. People talk of natural sympathies... You.So you will leave me?Go.Good evening.May I?Yes.You're right; I'm not.She was left on my hands.She has a governess.Donna Bianca, I give you beauty.So a Levantine pirate would do for you?Why did you leave the room?Why didn't you come and speak to me? I haven't seen you for weeks. It would have been normal and polite to wish me good evening.What have you been doing while I've been gone?You look pale. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 67.You're depressed; your eyes are shining with tears. What's the meaning of this?Who?Spanish Town...Not at all. Please tell him I'll see him directly.Oh Jane - Jane. This is a blow.Jane, if all those people came and spat at me, what would you do?And if they cast you out for adhering to me?You'd dare censure for my sake?Richard. How the devil are you?I'm here, be composed.A servant has had a nightmare, that's all. She's an excitable, nervous person and has taken a fit with fright.Now I must see you back into your rooms because until the house is settled, she can't be properly looked after. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 70.Miss Ingram, ladies, please return to your nests like the doves that you are. You'll take cold for certain if you stay in this icy gallery any longer.Come this way. Make no noise.Be steady. I need you.Wait.Thank you, Mrs Poole.Here. Bring the candle.No.It was folly to attempt the interview tonight and alone.It makes me impatient to hear you.Think of her as dead, dead and buried. Say nothing!I am going for a doctor. I must leave you here with him. Sponge the blood away when it returns. Give him water if he wants it. Do not speak to him for any reason. And Richard - on pain of death - do not speak to her.Jane, make sure the way is clear.I'll ride over tomorrow to see how you do. Goodbye, Richard.I do my best and have done it and will do it!Come, Jane. That house is a dungeon, don't you feel it?It is slime and cobwebs.Oh yes, don't trouble your head about her.Grace Poole is not the danger.You've noticed my tender feelings for Miss Ingram? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 73.Keep vigil with me again, the night before I marry. For now you've met my lovely one and you know her. She's a rare one, isn't she?A strapper, a real strapper; big and buxom...And if I ever bid you do what was wrong, you'd turn to me, quiet and pale and say 'I cannot do it.' And you'd be as immutable as a fixed star.What to do?What good can you do her?Promise me you won't stay long.What of it?To get her out of my bride's way who might otherwise trample her?At your peril you advertise. Trust it to me. I'll find you a good situation in time.How much do I owe you?Here's fifty.Take your wages.Then I only have a ten.Just so. Come back for it quickly. Meantime, I shall safeguard it in here.Do you trust me to keep it, Jane?There you are.Just like one of your tricks to steal into your home along with the twilight. Where the deuce have you been this last month?A true Janian reply. If I dared I'd touch you, to see if you were real...Go home - stay your wandering feet at a friend's threshold.Come and look at this fellow, Jane.Look at his wings. He looks West Indian - I have never seen one like him, here. There; flown.Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, isn't it?Yes, but it can't be helped. I soon hope to be a bridegroom.A situation, yes of course. It's the least I can do for a faithful paid subordinate such as yourself. You're to undertake the education of the five daughters of Mrs Dionysus O'Gall of Bitternut Lodge, Connaught. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 81.You'll like Ireland. They're such warm-hearted people, they say.From what?We've been good friends, Jane haven't we? But with the Irish sea between us you'd soon forget me.Then why must you be torn from me?I have no bride.Yes, I will.You must stay.JANE -As we are.NO -Then let your will decide your destiny. I offer you my hand, my heart and a share of all this.I ask you to pass through life at my side. Jane, you are my equal and my likeness. It is you I intend to marry.Do you doubt me?You have no faith in me?You little sceptic.What love have I for Miss Ingram? What love has she for me? I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was lost and got instant coldness. I wanted to make you jealous, to move you to love me. It's you - you strange, unearthly thing. I love you as my own flesh. You - poor and obscure as you are - please accept me as your husband.I must have you for my own.I swear it.I do.It will atone. It will atone.Good night. Good night.Is this my pale elf? This sunny faced girl with the radiant eyes?Soon to be Jane Rochester.Let the fairy tale begin.This morning I wrote to my banker in London to send certain jewels. In a day or two I hope to pour them into you lap -I will put the diamond chain around your neck myself -I'll dress you in these satins -Well for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven't your equal.And what's that?It's your time now, little tyrant but it'll soon be mine and when I have seized you, to have and to hold, I'll attach you to a chain, like this...What is it?Jane, this is the only explanation. It must have been half-dream, half- reality. A woman did enter your room last night and that woman was - must have been - Grace Poole - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 88.You know how strange she is. What did she do to me? To Mason? In a state between sleeping and waking -You noticed her entrance and her actions but you've ascribed to her an appearance different from her own. That was your nightmare -I see you'd ask why I keep such a woman in my house. When we've been married a year and a day, I promise I'll tell you. Are you satisfied Jane? Do you accept my solution?Dear God. It was only the veil...Come.Proceed. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 90.Proceed.Where is your proof?That does not prove that my wife is still living.How do you know?Produce him or go to hell.What have you to say?This girl knew nothing. She thought all was fair and legal. She never dreamt she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded wretch.Come, Jane, come all of you and meet Mrs Poole's charming patient. Come and meet my wife.Get back! Do not come near! Go, all of you - keep your congratulations - they come fifteen years too late!This clothed hyena is my wife.I was duped into marriage with this lunatic fifteen years ago.My own demon, Bertha.JANE - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 95.Five minutes more of that death- like hush and I'd have forced the lock.No tears. Your heart has been weeping blood. Forgive me.How could I? I am a worthless sinner. Don't spare me. Rain your tears up on me.I deserve a hail of fire.How are you now?I know you. You are thinking. Talking is no use; you are thinking how to act. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 96.Yes. There is no doubt that we both must change. I was wrong ever to keep you here; this narrow stone vault with its one real fiend. I'll shut it up. I'll pay Mrs Poole two hundred a year to care for its inmate and then no one will be harmed when she is prompted to burn people, to stab them, to bite the flesh from their bones -It's not because she's mad that I hate her. If you were mad do you think that I'd hate you?Then you know nothing about me, nothing about the way I love. Your mind is my treasure - and if it were broken it would be my treasure still. You are my sympathy, my better self, my angel. I will wrap my whole existence round you. Let us leave here tomorrow. Come with me - as my wife.I'll pledge you my fidelity -You'll live a happy, most innocent life -Don't you love me?Must be a part of me; that's what you mean. You are my wife, Jane. In truth -I was tricked, duped into wedlock with that demon-hate, that harlot, that succubus upstairs. My father wanted her money and so I was sent to Spanish Town and the match was made. I hardly spoke with her. I was dazzled, ignorant, raw. My senses were besotted and I married her - gross, grovelling mole-eyed blockhead that I was.I lived with her for four years. She dragged me through all the degrading agonies which attend those bound to the intemperate and unchaste. Her excesses developed germs of madness and the doctors shut her up. One night, unable to bear her screaming hate and knowing I could never be rid of her, I put a gun to my head to kill myself.I would have pulled the trigger, died in that tropical place but for a breeze which blew in from the sea and smelt of home. With it, I came to my senses. Bertha Antoinetta Mason had abused my long suffering, sullied my name, outraged my honour and blighted my youth. It was enough. At that moment, as I decided to live, she ceased to be my wife. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 98.Only my father and brother knew of the marriage and by then they were both dead. I let my connection with her be buried in oblivion and I brought her here. I have seen that she's cared for as her condition demands and that is all that God and humanity asks.Jane, it's not pity that I see in your face. It's not pity -It is love.I was wrong to deceive you. It was cowardly. I should have appealed to your spirit - as I do now - should have opened my life, described my hunger for a better existence - shown you my chains. I give you my life. I give you my pledge. Please, be my wife.You would be my equal.I would make it so.Not my mistress - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 99.I said wife, my wife -Do you really mean to leave me?Jane...Do you mean it now?And now?Oh Jane...What friends would you offend by living with me? Who would be injured? Who would care?Jane, it would not be wicked to love me...Will you listen to me?Will you hear reason?Because if you won't I'll try violence.I could bend you with my finger and thumb; a mere reed you feel in my hands.But your eye; resolute, free. What ever I do with this cage I cannot get at you. And it is you, soul, that I want. Why don't you come of your own free will here, to my heart? Oh come, Jane, come -You have never called me by my name. My name is Edward.Jane.Jane! Jane! Jane!I can see the candles, Martha, at your side like a luminous glow. And the fire; a red haze.Martha?Martha, is that you?Who's there?If you are real, touch me.Jane Eyre - Jane Eyre.You're not lying dead in some ditch? Not an outcast among strangers?She insults me -This is real. This is practical.You're altogether a human being, Jane?I'm a sightless block -Am I hideous, Jane?", "clean_line": "deuce hellfire pilot mesrour mesrour damnation come house know mr rochester servant
