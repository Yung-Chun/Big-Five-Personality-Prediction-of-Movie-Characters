He was an abusive, alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of cats.I guess the school board thinks because Hemingway's male and an asshole, he's worthy of our timeWhat about Colette? Charlotte Bronte? Simone de Beauvoir?Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls. I was merely a spectator.Tempestuous?As always, thank you for your excellent guidance.The fact that you're cutting gym so you can T.A.

Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.What's this?I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions. You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.Okay, say you do it. You kill yourself, you end up in wherever you end up and he's there. Do you really think he's gonna wanna dace a ninety pound compulsive who failed volleyball?Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.

I have no say at all.William didn't even go to high schoolNeither has his heterosexuality.I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming. Do you mind?If I was Bianca, it would be, \"Any school you want, precious. Don't forget your tiara.\"Janice Parker is an idiotSweating like a pig, actually.

Do you even know my name, screwboy?Doubtful. Very doubtful.I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.And why would I do that?You -- covered in my vomit.Are you following me?HiDepends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.Hey -- do you mind?Then tell them I had a seizure.I thought you were punishing me.Because you're making decisions for me.So what I want doesn't matter?I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices. I want --It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.What do you think?Let's hit it.No fear.Hello! We'd like two for Gigglepuss!I need agua!ShitTwo waters.You're not fooling anyone.That's what you want, isn't it?You're not surrounded by your usual cloud of smoke.Oh, really?You know who The Raincoats are?What?Who cares?Gigglepuss was so beyond.So true.What's normal?At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.It's Shakespeare. Maybe you've heard of him?I know about the goddamn party. I'm going.Can we go now?I'm driving.Wait -- was that?-- Did your hairline just recede?Away.Leave my sister alone.BIANCA\"I'm getting trashed, man.\" Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?Funny, you're the only oneBianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --I want another oneI'm fine. I'mI just need to lie down for awhileI know, just let me sleepOkay, I'll just sleep but stay awake, okay?This is so patronizing.Why 're you doing this?You don't care if I dieWhy?Like you could find oneJust let me sit down.Who?I hate him.Hey man. . .

Nothing.Sir, I'd like to state for the record that Mr. Verona ' s current incarceration is unnecessary. I never filed a complaint.But, Mr. Chapin, I hardly think a simple serenade warrants a week of detention. There are far more hideous acts than off-key singing being performed by the student body on a regular basis.Wait, Mr. Chapin. There's something I've always wanted to show you.These.Thank you, Mr. Chapin.He left! I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.C'mon.

Back then, was a different story.He said everyone was doing it. So I did it.Just once. Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore. I wasn't ready. He got pissed. Then he broke up with me.After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because \"everyone else\" was doing it. And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.That's notI guess I thought I was protecting you.Not all experiences are good, Bianca.
