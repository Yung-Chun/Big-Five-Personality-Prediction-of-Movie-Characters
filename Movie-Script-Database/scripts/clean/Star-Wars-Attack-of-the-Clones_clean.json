{"Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones": {"PADM\u00c9": {"raw_line": "Cord\u00e9...Less than an hour ago, an assassination attempt was made against my life. One of my bodyguards and six others were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered. I was the target but, more importantly, I believe this security measure before you, was the target. I have led the opposition to build an army... but there is someone in this body who will stop at nothing to assure it's passage...I warn you, if you vote to create this army, war will follow. I have experienced the misery of war first-hand; I do not wish to do it again.Wake up, Senators... you must wake up! If you offer the separatists violence, they can only show us violence in return! Many will lose their lives. All will lose their freedom. This decision could very well destroy the very foundation of our great Republic. I pray you do not let fear push you into a disastrous decision. Vote down this security measure, which is nothing less than a declaration of war! Does anyone here want that? I cannot believe they do.Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you have any idea who was behind the attack?I don't wish to disagree but I think that Count Dooku was behind it.I don't know, but everything in my being tells me he was behind it...Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe the...Chancellor, please! I don't want any more guards!This is not necessary, Chancellor.It has been far too long Master Kenobi. I'm so glad our paths have crossed again... but I must warn you that I think your presence here is unnecessary.Annie?? My goodness you've grown.Oh Annie, you'll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine.I don't need more security, I need answers. I want to know who is trying to kill me.Perhaps with merely your presence, the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed. Now if you will excuse me I will retire.Representative Binks. I know I can count on you.What?!You're a good friend, Jar Jar. I don't wish to hold you up. I'm sure you have a great deal to do.I do not like this idea of hiding.I haven't worked for a year to defeat the \"Military Creation Act\" not to be here when its fate is decided.Pride?!? Annie, you're young, and you don't have a very firm grip on politics. I suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time.Annie! No!What?I've always called you that... it is your name, isn't it?I'm sorry, Anakin. It's impossible to deny you've... ...that you've grown up.Mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. It's the only way we grow.That must be frustrating.I'm sorry... You sounded exactly like that little boy I once knew, when he didn't get his way.I didn't say it to hurt you.Don't try to grow up too fast.Please don't look at me like that.Because I can see what you're thinking.It makes me feel uncomfortable.Thank you, Captain. Take good care of Dorme... the threat's on you two now.You'll be fine.Then my Jedi protector will have to prove how grown up he is.I will be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi.I know.Suddenly, I'm afraid...There's nothing to worry about... we have Artoo with us.You seemed to be having a nightmare.Are you hungry?We went into lightspeed a while ago.You were just a little boy then. It may not be as you remember it; time changes your perception.It must be difficult having sworn your life to the Jedi... not being able to visit the places you like... or do the things you like...Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.You have changed so muchIt hasn't...Were you dreaming about you mother earlier, weren't you?I doubt that....and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls. The first time I saw the Capital, I was very young... I'd never seen a waterfall before. I though they were so beautiful... I never dreamed one day I'd live in the palace.No! That was the last thing I thought of. My dream was to help in the \"Refugee Relief Movement.\" I never thought of running for elected office. But the more history I studied, the more I realised how much good politicians could do. So when I was eight, I joined the \"Apprentice Legislators\", then later on became a Senatorial advisor, with such a passion that, before I knew it, I was elected Queen. Partly because I scored so high on my education certificate, but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible. I wasn't the youngest Queen ever elected, but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough. I'm not sure I was ready.Popular rule is not democracy, Annie. It gives the people what they want, not what they need. And, truthfully, I was relieved when my two terms were up. So were my parents. They worried About me during the blockade and couldn't wait for it all to be over. Actually, I was hoping to have a family by now... My sisters have the most amazing, wonderful kids... but when the Queen asked me to serve as Senator, I couldn't refuse her.I think so too.Thank you, Your Highness. I only Wish I could have served you better by staying on Coruscant for the vote.About two hundred. And more are leaving the Republic every day. If the Senate votes to create an army, I'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war.Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don't have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. I'm sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade Federation for help.I'm afraid that, despite the Chancellor's best efforts, there are still many bureaucrats, judges, and even Senators on the payrolls of the Guilds.There are rumours, Your Highness, that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered.Let's pray that day never comes.Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor. He's still a Padawan learner. I was thinking...Excuse me! I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated.Annie, my life is at risk, and this is my home. I know it very well... that is why we're here. I think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance.What's there to talk about? He's just a boy.Sola - stop it!I'm not your baby sister, Sola. Anakin and I are friends... our relationship is strictly professional. Mom, would you tell her to stop it?Cut it out.Oh, Mom, you're impossible. What I'm doing is important.When I was in Level Three, we used to come here for school retreat. See that island? We used to swim there every day. I love the water....We used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing.There was a very old man who lived on the island. He used to make glass out of sand - and vases and necklaces out of the glass. They were magical.You could look into the glass and see the water. The way it ripples and moves. It looked so real... but it wasn\u0092t.I used to think if you looked too deeply into glass, you would lose yourself.I shouldn't have done that.It's the situation... the stress...I don't know...Are you going to use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?All right... his name was Palo. I was twelve. We were both in the Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older then I... very cute... dark curly hair... dreamy eyes.I went on to become a Queen. He went on to become an artist.You're making fun of me.You're so bad!What?!?Don't you give me orders, Annie! I'm a Senator of the Galactic Republic. You have no authority to contain me, restrain me, or direct me! You remember your place, young man. Now you can come along and protect me or stay here. It's up to you.Count Dooku, I assume.Don't worry he's housebroken.You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi- Wan Kenobi. I am formally requesting you turn him over to me, now.He is an officer of the Republic. You can't do that.And if I don't join your rebellion, I assume this Jedi with me will also die?The ideals are still alive, Count, even if the institution is failing.If what you say is true, you should stay in the Republic and help Chancellor Palpatine put things right.I cannot believe that. I will not forsake all I have honoured and worked for and betray the Republic. I know of your treaties with the Trade Federation, the Commerce Guilds, and the others, Count. What is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business... it's business becoming government!What is to happen to me? Am I to be executed also?Anakin...You are committing an act of war, Archduke. I hope you are prepared for the consequences.I'm not afraid to die. I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.I love you.I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. My love for you is a puzzle, Annie, for which I have no answers. I can't control it... and now I don't care. I truly, deeply love you, and before we die I want you to know.Anakin!", "clean_line": "cord\u00e9 hour ago assassination attempt life bodyguards ruthlessly senselessly murdered target importantly believe security measure target led opposition build army body stop assure passage warn vote create army war follow experienced misery war hand wish wake senators wake offer separatists violence violence return lose lives lose freedom decision destroy foundation great republic pray let fear push disastrous decision vote security measure declaration war want believe thank master yoda idea attack wish disagree think count dooku know tells chancellor comment believe chancellor want guards necessary chancellor far long master kenobi glad paths crossed warn think presence unnecessary annie goodness ve grown oh annie ll little boy knew tatooine need security need answers want know trying kill merely presence mysteries surrounding threat revealed excuse retire representative binks know count good friend jar jar wish hold sure great deal like idea hiding haven worked year defeat military creation act fate decided pride annie young firm grip politics suggest reserve opinions time annie ve called isn sorry anakin impossible deny ve ve grown mentors way seeing faults like way grow frustrating sorry sounded exactly like little boy knew way hurt try grow fast look like thinking makes feel uncomfortable thank captain good care dorme threat ll fine jedi protector prove grown grateful speed master jedi know suddenly afraid worry artoo having nightmare hungry went lightspeed ago little boy remember time changes perception difficult having sworn life jedi able visit places like things like allowed love thought forbidden jedi changed muchit hasn dreaming mother earlier weren doubt soft sound distant waterfalls time saw capital young seen waterfall beautiful dreamed day live palace thing thought dream help refugee relief movement thought running elected office history studied realised good politicians joined apprentice legislators later senatorial advisor passion knew elected queen partly scored high education certificate conviction reform possible wasn youngest queen elected think sure old sure ready popular rule democracy annie gives people want need truthfully relieved terms parents worried blockade couldn wait actually hoping family sisters amazing wonderful kids queen asked serve senator couldn refuse think thank highness wish served better staying coruscant vote leaving republic day senate votes create army sure going push civil war feel threatened separatists army provoked defend sure time money build army guess turn commerce guilds trade federation help afraid despite chancellor best efforts bureaucrats judges senators payrolls guilds rumours highness federation army reduced ordered let pray day comes anakin jedi counsellor padawan learner thinking excuse thinking stay lake country places isolated annie life risk home know think wise advantage knowledge instance talk boy sola stop baby sister sola anakin friends relationship strictly professional mom tell stop cut oh mom impossible important level come school retreat island swim day love water lie sand let sun dry try guess names birds singing old man lived island glass sand vases necklaces glass magical look glass water way ripples moves looked real wasn think looked deeply glass lose shouldn situation stress know going use jedi mind tricks right palo legislative youth program years older cute dark curly hair dreamy eyes went queen went artist making fun bad orders annie senator galactic republic authority contain restrain direct remember place young man come protect stay count dooku assume worry housebroken holding jedi knight obi wan kenobi formally requesting turn officer republic join rebellion assume jedi die ideals alive count institution failing true stay republic help chancellor palpatine things right believe forsake honoured worked betray republic know treaties trade federation commerce guilds count happening government bought business business government happen executed anakin committing act war archduke hope prepared consequences afraid die ve dying little bit day came life love think lives destroyed love puzzle annie answers control care truly deeply love die want know anakin"}, "OBI-WAN": {"raw_line": "It's Good to see you, too, Jar Jar.It's a great pleasure to see you again, M'Lady.I'm sure the Jedi Council have their reasons.Our presence will be invisible, M'Lady.We're here to protect you Senator, not to start an investigation.We are not going to exceed our mandate, my young Padawan learner.We are not going through this exercise again, Anakin. You will pay attention to my lead.What??!!We will do as the Council has instructed, and you will learn your place, young one.Anakin, you're focusing on the Negative again. Be mindful of your thoughts. She was glad to see us. Now lets check the security here.Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs. No assassin will try that way. Any activity up here?What's going on?What is she thinking?It's not an intruder I'm worried about. There are many other ways to kill a Senator.You're using her as bait??It's too risky... and your senses aren't that attuned, young apprentice.Possibly.You look tired.Because of your mother?Dreams pass in time.Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they betray you. You've made a commitment to the Jedi order... a commitment not easily broken... and don't forget she's a politician. They're not to be trusted.It's been my experience that Senators are only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns... and they are more than willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds.Palpatine's a politician, I've observed that he is very clever at following the passions and prejudices of the Senators.I sense it, too.I have a bad feeling about this.What took you so long?If you'd spend as much time working on your saber skills as you do on your wit, young Padawan, you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.Only in your mind, my very young apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!I don't mind flying... but what you're doing is suicide!Just slow down!Wait! Don't go in there!You know I don't like it when you do that!What are you doing? He's gonna blast me!That was too close!What??Whooooaaa! Don't do that! I don't like it when you do that!It's dangerous near those power couplings! Slow down! Don't go through there!Yiiii, what are you doing?Oh, that was good...Stop!!I'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm crazy.It didn't work... we've stalled! And you almost got us killed!It was stupid!But you didn't!!! And now we've lost him.Where are you going?! He went down there, the other way.What do you mean, \u0091You think?\u0092 What kind of shortcut?! He went completely the other way! You\u0092ve lost him!Oh, so that\u0092s why we\u0092re going in the wrong direction.Well, you lost him.Anakin!Patience.Here. Next time try not to lose it.A Jedi's saber is his most precious possession.He must keep it with him at all times.This weapon is your life!But, you haven't learned anything, Anakin.Why do I think you are going to be the death of me?!Then why don't you listen to me?!Do you see him him?Then be extra careful... Check it out.To get a drink.You don't want to sell me death- sticks.You want to go home and rethink your life.Do you know who it was you were trying to kill?Who hired you?This wound's going to need treatment.Toxic Dart...Anakin, you stay put on Naboo. Do not attract any attention. Do absolutely nothing without checking in with me or the Council.I will get to the bottom of this plot quickly, M'Lady. You'll be back here in no time.May the Force be with you.I hope he doesn't try anything foolish.It's a toxic dart. I need to know where it came from and who made it.Excuse me? Could you try again please?Thanks for your assistance! You may not be able to figure this out, but I think I know someone who might.I'm looking for Dexter.He's not in trouble. It's personal.Hey, Dex.Thank you.Hey, Dex.You can tell me what this is.Do you know where it came from?Kamino Kyberdart... I wonder why it didn't show up in any analysis archive.Well, Dex, if droids could think, we wouldn't be here, would we? Kamino... doesn't sound familiar. Is it part of the Republic?Cloners? Are they friendly?On what, Dex?Yes... yes, I did...I never understood why he quit. Only twenty Jedi have ever left the Order.What happened?Really?Interesting... I'm still not sure I understand.Yes, I'm trying to find a planet system called Kamino. It doesn't seem to show upon any of the archive charts.According to my information, it should be in this quadrant somewhere... just south of the Rishi Maze.All three actually.Absolutely.Wouldn't that be on record?That's impossible... perhaps the archives are incomplete.I am sorry to disturb you, Master.I\u0092m looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him. But the system doesn\u0092t show up on the archive maps.This is where it ought to be... but it isn\u0092t. Gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot. There should be a star here... but there isn\u0092t.But Master Yoda who could have erased information from the archives? That\u0092s impossible, isn\u0092t it?I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be on his own.But he still has much to learn. And his abilities have made him... well... arrogant. I realise now what you and Master Yoda knew from the beginning... the boy was too old to start the training and...Master, he should not have been given this assignment. I'm afraid Anakin won't be able to protect the Senator.He has a... an emotional connection with her. It's been there since he was boy. Now he's confused... distracted.Has Master Yoda gained any insight into whether or not this war will come about?I'm expected?Obi-Wan Kenobi.You make me feel most welcome.That is... good news.I'm sorry Master - ?Oh, yes. Sido-Dyas.That's why I'm here.Where is this bounty hunter now?Unaltered?I would like to meet this Jango Fett.You mentioned growth acceleration...And these?Very impressive.Tell me, prime minister, when my Master Sido-dyas first contacted you, did he say the order was for... himself... or?The Repubic?Arfour, Arfour...Arfour, relay this, \"scramble code five,\" to Courscant: care of \"the old folks home.\"...I've never heard of a Jedi called Sido-Dyas, have you, Master?I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin we're looking for.I will, Master, and I will also find out more about this clone army... May The Force...Your clones are very impressive. You must be very proud.Aren't we all?Ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant?Recently?Then you must know Master Sido- Dyas?Sido-Dyas. Isn\u0092t he the Jedi who hired you for this job?No? I thought...Curious...It seems to me it's your army - being that they are all clones of you.I look forward to seeing them in action. Thank you for your time, Jango.I won't forget.\"Guiding light\" to \"old folks home.\"...Starships from the Trade Federation and the Commerce Guilds are taking deliveries of battle droids from the foundries on Geonosis.The droid foundry seems to be working at full capacity. I am going to go down and investigate. I will bring Jango Fett back home for interrogation.One more thing. Jango mentioned he was recruited by someone named Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that might be?Do you believe he could be the mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the deal for the clone army?Let me see if I can figure out what's going on first....Alliance have pledged their armies to Count Dooku and are forming an... Wait!... ah... attack... I don't... make it... aaaggghhh!I was beginning to wonder if you had gotten my message.It looks like you're going a good job so far.Take the one the left.

We have to go after Dooku.Don't let your personal feelings get in the way. We've got a job to do.Anakin! She's all right! Look.Follow that speeder!We move in together - you slowly on the...Anakin, no!I don't think so.You will have to prove it.Anakin!On his way back to Naboo.

Protection is a job for local security... not Jedi. It's overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate.She didn't even recognise me, Jar Jar.

I was only trying to...Please don't call me that.Annie...It's Anakin. When you say Annie it's like I'm still a little boy... and I'm not.Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it...Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan is a great mentor. As wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. Only... although I'm a Padawan learner, in some ways... a lot of ways... I'm ahead of him. I'm ready for the trials. I know I am! He knows it too. He believes I'm too unpredictable... Other Jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it... I know I started my training late... but he won't let me move on.It's worse... he's overly critical. He never listens! He just doesn't understand! It's not fair!I'm not whining! I'm not.I know...I am grown up. You said it yourself.Why not?Ahh... so, you have Jedi powers too?Sorry, M'lady.Yes, Master.Time to go.May the Force be with you, Master.I'm kinda scared too. This is my first assignment on my own.No, no, Mom, no...What?Thank you.I look forward to seeing Naboo again. I've thought about it every day since I left. It's by far the most beautiful place I've ever seen...I think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception.Or be with the people I love.Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi's life, so you might say we're encouraged to love.You haven't changed a bit. You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has changed much either.I can't wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills. Whenever I try to visualise the Force, those hills are what I see.I love Naboo.Yes... I left Tatooine so long ago, my memory of her is fading. I don't want to lose it. Recently I've been seeing her in my dreams... vivid dreams... scary dreams. I worry about her.If I grew up here, I don't think I'd ever leave.No, really. When I started my training, I was very homesick and very lonely. This city and my Mom were the only pleasant things I had to think about... The problem was, the more I thought about my Mom, the worse I felt. But I would feel better if I thought about the palace - the way it shimmers in the sunlight - the way the air always smells of flowers...Well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl?The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office.I agree! I think the Republic needs you... I'm glad you chose to serve. I feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways.The Jedi have not been allowed to investigate. It would be to be too dangerous for the economy, we were told.Hey, hold on a minute!Excuse me?! I am in charge of security here, M'Lady.Sorry, M'Lady.No, but I...Hello.A little....Yes... I'm afraid she is.Padme tells me you teach at the university?There have been two attempts on her life. Chances are there'll be more. My Master is tracking down the assassins. I'm sure he'll find out who they are. This situation, won't last long.I don't either.I just want to get there before dark.You still live at home.I never had a real home. Home was always where my Mom was.Is this you?I do too. I guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet.I don\u0092t like sand. It\u0092s coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everything\u0092s soft... and smooth...Everything here is magical.Sometimes, when you believe something to be real, it becomes real. Real enough, anyway...I think it's true...I'm sorry. When I'm around you, my mind is no longer my own....the view.What?I'm not really supposed to do that... for fun, I mean. If Master Obi-Wan were here, he'd be very grumpy.May I tell you something?Then how can I tell you?It doesn't work around you. My mind is always a muddle... I can only think of you.From the moment I met you, all those years ago, a day hasn't gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm close to you again, I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask...If you are suffering as much as I am, tell me.Anything's possible. Padme, please listen...Then you do feel something! There's an extraordinary connection between us. You can't deny that.I was destined to be a Jedi. I don't think I could be anything else. But you are asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. I wish I could wish my feelings away... but I can't.It wouldn't have to be that way... we could keep it a secret....No, you're right. It would destroy us.Sure you do... you just don't want to tell me.They only work on the weak-minded. You are anything but weak-minded.All right, I get the picture... whatever happened to him?Maybe he was the smart one.I like two or three, but I'm not really sure about one of them. I don't think the system works.We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems, agree what's in the best interests of all the people, and then do it.Then they should be made to.I don't know. Someone.Of course not me.Someone wise.Well, if it works...On no, I'd be much too frightened to tease a Senator.You're always so serious. Always carrying the weight of the universe on your shoulders.No...No...No...Mom!...Don't, no, don't!Don't go.Your presence is soothing.Jedi don't have nightmares.I saw my mother. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. She's suffering, Padme. She is in pain...They're killing her! I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator. I know I will be punished and possibly thrown out of the Jedi Order, but I must go. I have to help her! I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a choice.What about Master Obi-wan?Wait, please.Excuse me, Watto.I said excuse me.Let me help you with that.I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.My mother...Sold her...Do you know where they are?I'd like to know.Threepio?I've come to see my mother.I'm Anakin Skywalker. I'm here looking for my mother.Is my mother here?To find my mother.I can feel her pain, and I will find her. I know she's alive.You are going to have to stay here. These are good people, Padme. You'll be safe.I trust you'll watch over her, Owen.I won't be long.Mom... Mom... Mom...I\u0092m here, Mom. You\u0092re safe. Hang on. I\u0092m going to get you out of here...Just stay with me, Mom. I\u0092m going to make you well again. Everything\u0092s going to be fine.I'm going after him!Yeah, you're right, you're right.Understood, Master.If he's still alive....He's like my father, but you heard Master Windu. He gave me strict orders to stay here.Hey, where are you going?No! You're not!I'm not letting you go out there. It's too dangerous.It's my job to protect you. I said it's too dangerous. You're not going, and that's final!Don't be afraid.What are you talking about?You love me?! I thought we decided not to fall in love. That we would be forced to live a lie. That it would destroy our lives...I have no desire to be cured of this love either. Long or short, I vow to spend the rest of my life with you.I retransmitted it as you requested, Master. Then we decided to come and rescue you.I have a bad feeling about this.What about Padme?You okay?Jump!!!It's Dooku, go after him!Padme!!!Put the ship down! Down!No we're not!! Land this ship!I don't care!.. Go back.I'm taking him now!You'll pay for all the Jedi you've killed today, Dooku.I'm a slow learner.Don't bet on it!", "clean_line": "hi jar jar grown beautiful mean shorter senator mean trying kill

Don't say you're shy!Ryoo!! Pooja!!I'm so happy to see you! This is Anakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, and this is Pooja.Anakin, this is my sister, Sola.He's being polite, Mom. We're starving.Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend! He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate to protect me.It's not, Mom, I promise. Anyway, Anakin's a friend. I've known him for years. Remember that little boy who was with the Jedi during the blockade crisis?He grew up.Mom, I'm not in any danger.But not much.Don't worry, this won't take long.I move around so much, I've never had a place of my own. Official residences have no warmth. I feel good here. I feel at home.That was when I went with the Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran. Their sun was imploding, and the planet was dying. I was helping to relocate the children. See that little one I'm holding? His name was N'a-kee-tula, which means sweethear. He was so full of life,. All those kids were. I did everything I could to save him, but he died... they all did. They were never able to adapt... to live off their native planet.My first day as an Apprentice Legislator. Notice the difference?You did that?That! Now stop it!Anakin!!I don't know.Maybe you should use your Jedi intuition.Anakin, don't......I can't. We can't. It's just not possible.You listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi Knight. I'm a Senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other.Annie, it doesn't make any difference. Jedi aren't allowed to marry. You swore an oath, remember? You'd be expelled from the Order. I will not let you give up your responsibilities... your future, for me.I am not going to give into this. I'm not going to throw my life away. I have more important things to do than fall in love.Then we'd be living a lie - one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. Mt sister saw it. So did my mother. I couldn't do that. Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that?You really don't like politicians, do you?How would you have it work?That is exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don't wlways agree. In fact, they hardly ever do.By whom? Who's going to make them?You?But someone.That sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.You had a nightmare again last night.I heard you.Annie, I told you I wouldn't let you give up your future for me. I'll go with you. That way you can continue to protect me, and you won't be disobeying your mandate.I guess we won't tell him, will we?Stay with the ship, Artoo.Hello, Threepio.Threepio, what's happened?I'm Padme.No, Annie!Anakin...I'm not leaving, Threepio. I just can't sleep.I guess you're lucky.You're not happy here?Being like what?I guess I wouldn't like it at all.Maybe we can do something about it.Why not? They seem to have a box of old coverings here.Let's see, if we put this... here...You'll have to be quiet, Threepio. Hold still, please.There!I thought the first thing he said was to retransmit his message to Coruscant.They'll never get there in time to save him. They have to come half way across the galaxy. Look, Geonosis is less than a parsec away.Annie, are you just going to sit here and let him die?? He's your friend... your mentor...He gave you strict orders to protect me......and I'm going to save Obi-Wan. So if you plan to protect me, you will have to come along.To find Obi-Wan.Let go of me!It's empty!Wait!Sure! Well, sort of.Look!", "clean_line": "anakin house shy ryoo pooja happy anakin anakin ryoo pooja anakin sister sola polite mom starving sola isn boyfriend jedi assigned senate protect mom promise anakin friend ve known years remember little boy jedi blockade crisis grew mom danger worry won long ve place official residences warmth feel good feel home went relief group shadda bi boran sun imploding planet dying helping relocate children little holding kee tula means sweethear life kids save died able adapt live native planet day apprentice legislator notice difference stop anakin know maybe use jedi intuition anakin possible listen live real world come studying jedi knight senator follow thoughts conclusion place regardless way feel annie difference jedi aren allowed marry swore oath remember expelled order let responsibilities future going going throw life away important things fall love living lie couldn wanted mt sister saw mother couldn anakin live like like politicians work exactly trouble people wlways agree fact hardly going sounds awful lot like dictatorship nightmare night heard annie told wouldn let future ll way continue protect won disobeying mandate guess won tell stay ship artoo hello threepio threepio happened padme annie anakin leaving threepio sleep guess lucky happy like guess wouldn like maybe box old coverings let ll quiet threepio hold thought thing said retransmit message coruscant ll time save come half way galaxy look geonosis parsec away annie going sit let die friend mentor gave strict orders protect going save obi wan plan protect come obi wan let wait sure sort look"}}}
