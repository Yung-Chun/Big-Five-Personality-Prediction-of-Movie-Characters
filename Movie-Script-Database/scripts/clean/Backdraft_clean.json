He never does it right.And DIE!Fireman shit?Firehouse.Dad!Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?So you're going to fight fires now, huh?Doesn't work on you. See ya around, little brother.Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company. One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...Got a cause?The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.It's comin' along... want a beer?It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.What, you've never seen one before?It works.People actually used to pay you for this?Sheep don't count.That was never proved.Why'd you come here, Brian?What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.Thanks for the speakers.Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.You're too late, probie.Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.Be gentle.Hey, probie! How 'bout it, huh?You're doing it wrong.Stay beside me.No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.I knew you were a pussy! C'mon! Steam us! Let's go!Ya love it, probie?Hook us up to a stand-pipe.Jesus, how 'bout man, huh? We're gonna loose this!Hey Otis, is it...?Goddamn it, where's our backup? Where's the second-in companies?Dig in!Dig in, goddamn it!You're gonna love this.Adcox! Take Tim and do a search.Don't you fold on me now, man.Clear the hose for me.You all right?Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.-- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.-- I told you to stay next to me!What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.Bet 30,000 dollars a year and twenty two days a month off sounded pretty good twelve weeks ago, huh?C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...Hey! Swayzak!We almost lost a whole company up there, Swayzee buddy. Isn't any back- up since you closed '33. And we really appreciate it, the guys and me. Honest. I know you've got my vote for mayor.Oh yeah, your famous task force... three guys have already died this year because of the cuts made by your \"task force\"...If anybody's light's gonna blink, it's yours.Tim, fill out the alarm card. Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.Better be good.Bye, boys.Clean the toilets.Okay, company dismissed. -- See ya guys tonight at Fitzgerald's retirement party.You want a ride?Brian -- -- See ya tonight.Hey.I gotta change the view...Y'know, I think it's a union bylaw that if a guy gets in the paper -- especially if it's bullshit -- he owes the company a drink. In fact... ...I'll have a double. On the hero.Whatever...Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...Jackson.What's wrong with right now? He's your son for christ's sake. He's --...Yeah?You can't talk about my brother like that...Leave me alone!No. I need a drink.I'm okay... leave me alone...Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?I don't think I can get up.Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too....Adcox, those guys...they don't get it... it isn't the goddamn promotion... or dad... I'm not my old man, y'know? No fire's gonna get me... I don't give a shit about being a captain... it's just... it's just they don't trust me anymore... ...they don't trust me anymore...If you'd get out of my fuckin' way. I could take my own goddamn shoes off...You're such a pain in the ass... You've always been a pain in the ass...Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...Yeah... too bright...They don't know... they don't know what I hear in there......This boat could be okay, huh?... Take it out weekends... Sean 'n me...Hey! Knock it off!Nah, we just about got it.Yeah, it's bullshit. So what? Fuck Swayzak. Fuck 'em all. We don't go into fires for them. You know that. Christ, you taught me that.You know Knowlton pretty well?Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?We're gonna be okay, man...Alright... Go!Go!That isn't a football, probie. Get it on your shoulder.You're not breaking any records, Brian.Your shoulder. Like this!Come on! Pick it up!Run, damn you!Roll the hose.You heard me.You got a problem with drilling, probie?Roll the hose.Well, thank God for fires...Don't take that kind of shit from it! Don't let it know you're scared! Come on!Ready?Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.Now!You okay?That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today? What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?That's just about enough, guys, okay?Here. Dry yourself off.Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.Brian, look --Hey, Bri... Rimgale's okay. I don't get half the shit he's talking about, but then everybody says the same thing about me. Who the hell knows?Fixing my roof.Where's Sean?Oh yeah? How's he doing?Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.Sorry I hit Jackson.He treats you okay?I treated you better.Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.He's out.Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.In a fire? Never. Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...You know what I realized today? I can't remember my dad's face anymore. There's pictures of him staring at me everywhere I go, but the guy behind them... he's gone...I'll see ya around, Helen.Where is it?Wonderful.If the doors open and it's hot, don't get out.It's here.Want to learn something?Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!Oh, you're so very sly, but so amLotta smoke, but it isn't rolling... that means it's hiding... staying sleepy... one of these doors...Easy... no hurry... you're not going anywhere...Did you check the door for heat, Tim?Tim?Tim!Hey, Stevie....Not now, Brian.I had that fire. He didn't listen!Fuck you.He's gonna live. Maybe not much else, but he's gonna live...I'm busy.-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?What, they don't knock on your planet?I'm working on it....He wasn't listening to the right thing...You don't know... nobody knows...It knows us. This one knows us.Tim-went-to-the-fire-and-now-he- doesn't-have-a-face.I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.Look, I'm sorry I ---- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.Hey... Sean-man, your dad blew it. I forgot I had to work this morning...Next time, huh? We'll do it up big. Promise.Hey, what are you doing here?So hello.Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...Yeah? What have you got to do? Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.-- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done. What, because I wasn't such a genius the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was I supposed to do? You tell me, what the fuck was I supposed to do?!-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some. Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...Saw what?Everybody did....Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?Maybe I do. ...What a fuckin' mess, huh? People can change Brian.I don't know, Brian... I don't know...-- What are you doing here?I know.I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.They were for the fucking boat, Brian.I'll be there.I'll be there, goddamn it!Anything else?I'll handle it.I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.Brian?-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.-- Knock it off!Shut up!There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.Jesus Christ Brian, run! Run goddamn it!You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?Oh shut up, huh? I think I broke my goddamn arm...You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!Let it go! Goddamn it let it go!You go, we go.Wait for another hose team...Wait for the goddamn hose team!That's my brother!

If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.See you Monday. Sir.Completely out of control.A beer, Willy!It's in my blood, Willy.Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.Management were pin heads.Coffee sucked.I was ahead of my time.Engine 115, right?Lucky guess. And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.Mrs. Viatkus...Jennifer.You look great.Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.Yeah? What have you been up to?Really? No kidding.Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.Backdraft.I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen.

Where is he, anyway?Oh, man, I'm sorry.Hey.I talked to Helen......Man, I thought dad's boat was finally retired to the family graveyard. Don't you worry about falling out of this thing?I like what you've done with the place.Been ripping off fire stations?Bachman Turner Overdrive? ...Buffalo Springfield?... Stephen Bishop? Oh man...My God, an actual operating 8-track.In the Field Museum once.It worked when you were in sixth grade.Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.Yeah? What about Laura --I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother \"you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed\" games?Hey! You don't know me --So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?There's only so much technology can do. Thanks for the beer.Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.Goddamn it, Stephen...I'm Brian.I'm in heaven, Lt.Hey!Hey, I think it's coming from a different staircase.I got one!I got somebody! I got somebody!Is she... Is she alive?Shit...Yeah. Fine. I'm a little busy right now.-- C'mon, Stephen.Goddamn it Stephen!-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!My Lt. might have something to say about that.John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...-- Never mind.This is your city job?Have you guys got something against dalmatians?Do you have to do that?Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.What's going on?Thanks.Hey.With grenadine, right?Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?Carrying Swayzak's notebook?Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.What?What's going on?Yeah. Big fan.Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.Every little boy's fantasy.I have a job.Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.Thanks anyway, Mr. Swayzak, but fire engines sorta run in my family. Politics don't.C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.So now you suddenly care about my future?Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.You don't need a drink, man. You need to get outta here...So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?C'mon, let's crawl home.This?Having fun, fireman?What, are you kidding? By myself?What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.Goddamn you Stephen, I'm not gonna quit. You hear me!Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...I waited... I would have fucking waited...Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?You're right, Stephen... You win... You're the best, man...I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.Yeah...Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.Where are you going?Hey, do I know you?What the hell are you talking about my --What do you want me to do with --What are you listening to?Glass?-- Another backdraft.No it couldn't.I mean you'd be right -- with normal wire. But that's gauge ten in that plug -- industrial stuff. Who knows why they put it in here -- but it won't melt at less than 12,000 degrees. And no natural spark short of lightning gets that hot. In another life I was in high-end electronics.Don't mention it.Hey, Tim.So, you surviving without me?Swayzak's not my boss.Grindle, scrape down that wall for me, huh? I would myself, but the tie 'n all, y'know...Yeah? Where?Thanks for the insight.Just leave me alone, okay?Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...\"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --\"\"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium\".Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.And the putty around the door?But the right guess on this is arson.Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.Arson.Hey.Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...Call ya back.Jesus!What?But he killed these guys.What reason?That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?Are you going public with this?Hey... So are you dating your boss or what?Sorry. Are you dating anyone?Well, you did invite me here.Nice boat.Okay.No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.Thanks for the invite.Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.I wanted to be a good one.Old firehouse trick.Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.This is a six inch playpipe, cast bronze to keep it firm during hard flows. This is our pipe extender, used in forward lays... This is our hard suction line... Our adjustable insertion nozzle... ...And this is the hose bed.Excuse us.Is he...Do they think he'll pull through?I should have been there.You had to do it, didn't you?Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen. You burned him.You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers ---- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.Yeah? And just how much of all this has been \"doing your job\"?Leave Stephen out of this ---- I work for the city.Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.Backdraft?Fire.Somewhere between zero and no way.Go talk to the building owner.Our book lists the owner as Dekom Trust.Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are... Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...Nice bunch of guys.Hi.Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.You could check. It'd be in his files.Yes.Your boss is lying, Jennifer.Jennifer?What is --I'm sorry.You're right.Yeah? Airtight?I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.Then who wrote the report?How ya feeling?Did you pull me out?Did I say thanks?Just wondering.So what do you want me to do?I'm close... but I can't get who it is...Who's doing this?Then who --I don't have a story.What?I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...The outlets.Trychticholorate.Who the fuck is doing this?Who's doing this?Oh Jesus Christ...Oh goddamn it Stephen...Just... Just wanted to say hello...You're selling dad's boat?I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --It's okay, Stephen, I --I saw it.When dad died, I saw another fire...I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...Sometimes right when you're looking at them.Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!How do you know?-- What were they doing there?What are we going to do about this?We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.Oh, Christ. Stephen...Where are they? Where's 17?Stephen --Did you do it for Tim?Just come down, John. Just ---- He killed people ---- Stephen, this is bullshit --You're his Lt., Stephen... Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?\"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --\"Stephen!NO!You're gonna be all right, man.Hey! Over here!No... No more.Another time, friend.I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.Oh man, don't you die... Don't you die...Goddamn it don't you die now... Not now!Yeah.Like it never happened...See that glow flashing in the corner of your eye? That's your career dissipation light.

I'll start charging you admission.Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.They're gonna have to wait a few days on this one.Alderman Swayzak.I need to get in the trunk.Awful expensive shoes to be wearing at a fireground, Alderman. But then I guess you haven't been to too many fires.You'll have an answer as soon as I do.-- You mean his firehouse closing program, -- Don't you?Alderman, I have a remarkably uncomplicated job. To decide if a fire's arson, and if so catch the pain in the ass doing it. But to be honest, if my methodical investigative methods just happen to muck up the campaign of certain mayor wanna-bees, well, I guess I can't say I sleep any less peacefully....So stop me if I get this wrong... The fire's almost out... You're upstairs on the unburned floor checking for heat. You've been told by your Battalion Chief, your Captain, by me, not to do anything up there until ordered. But now the itch starts, and all of a sudden comes the Glory Boy Flash: Hey, I'm a hero. Heroes don't just stand around. So on your own you decided to punch out a window for ventilation. Was that before or after you noticed you were standing in a lake of gasoline?You could've crispered half your company with that little stunt, but more importantly you wrecked the physical evidence I use to prove it's arson. You've made my day longer, Probie. Go home and think about that.Your Dennis' kid. I work alone.Are you still here?Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer. You think you're the first?Pest control.How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.He works for me.You like everybody, Ronald.You don't know him.Knock it off. Now.Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?Nobody cares, Ronald.Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.Excuse me. What do you do with little girls?What do you do with them, Ronald? Huh?And old ladies?And the world -- the whole world.See ya next year, Ronald. Gotta go.Hey kid, c'mere -- At least make yourself useful.Turn this over.-- Shhh.You sneaky little son of a bitch... Hide and seek... Come on, tell me what I want to know...Heavy smoke stains observed in entry room. Demarkation line high. Fire never got hot enough here to cook soot off. It started somewhere else... Less soot here. More heat. And very little soot here. Get that couch out of the way.So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry... Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance. Find me some glass.Do we have a language barrier here? Glass.Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn. You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad? Or scared. It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...Finish coat burned away... Severe spawling of rough coat...That's our ignition point. Dig it out. Carefully.Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.Have outlet analyzed for any traces of flammable accelerants.Check the wall for burn patterns.Putty? On both doors?McCaffrey, hold this for us.I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.What the hell was it doing in the fire?I asked you to hold him, not feel him up...Read.-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easierI don't guess.I don't work for them, either.Take the top off. Go ahead. Take it off.That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts.But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.Goes on about how the break was made through the discovery of \"chemical traces\" and a \"behavioral link\". Oh, and Swayzak's quoted saying the chief investigator is closing in on the torch and expects an arrest \"any time\".Get your stuff and get out.Alderman.I usually have breakfast first.\"Don?\"No Marty, I don't.We still haven't found a connection between the victims.Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.Is there a connection between them, Alderman?What the hell are you doing here?I thought 'ol Marty was acting a little strange... And he's right.The backdraft was set somewhere in there. It fried Holcomb when he opened the inner door. But the outer door held... and waited for Tim...So find me the fire.You're thinking too much of the building and not enough of the ghost.In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?It's a living thing, Brian. It breathes, it eats, and it hates.The only way to beat it is to think like it. To know that this flame will spread this way across the floor not because of the physics of flammable liquids or heat convection, but because it wants to.Some guys on this job, fire owns them. It makes them fight on its level. But the only way to truly kill it is to love it a little, just like Ronald.We're the fire department, lady.You work here?You seem real broken up about Mr. Holcomb.I still haven't gotten your fire report, Stevie. On Tim.I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it. What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?What do you listen to, Stephen?I might.I need that report, Lt.Son of a bitch. They knew each other.And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.Who all ended up wearing candles for faces... Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.We need to get a look at his files.This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?I think it's time Mr. Swayzak and us had a little heart to heart talk.Hello? Swayzak?Uh... I sorta got a problem here...Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...Yeah.No.I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close... We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...In the Chicago Fire Department the alarm code 3-3-5 signifies that the company has returned home to quarters. We will now ring out that code to welcome home John Adcox and Stephen McCaffrey...Your brother was a good man.Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read? You're the only one that knows.Want to help me with something?Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --This is just a guess of course, but I think they're gonna want to know why you secretly paid Donald Cosgrove, Jeffrey Holcomb and Alan Seagrave to create a phony manpower study. You guys'll wait, right?-- Brian.Don't keep looking over your shoulder for the ghost.
