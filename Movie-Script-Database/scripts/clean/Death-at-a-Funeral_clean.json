{"Death-at-a-Funeral": {"AARON": {"raw_line": "Brian... who is that?Who is this man I'm looking at? 'Cause it's not my father.Are you asking me if I'm sure I know what my father looks like?Man, look at the damn body! Brian peers into the coffin. We see it's an ASIAN MAN.Come on, Brian. You know what my father looks like. He used to take you to little league.It's happened before?! You mean this is a normal thing?... This isn't Burger King. You can't just mess up my order.You think?I better .,see my dad in this coffin in an hour, or you're going to take his place. The undertakers pick up the coffin and shuffle out awkwardly.You do that.They brought the wrong body. Can you believe that?They think so. They're getting him now. The thermometer beeps and Michelle removes it from her mouth..You were right. Please don't rub it in, not today. I've got so much to worry about. Michelle gets up and heads to the bathroom as Aaron takes out some index cards and looks them over.Dad insisted on having the funeral here, Mom's crying all the time, Ryan didn't help with anything, not like he ever does! Plus my eulogy sucks. I can't wait until this day is over.If it is, at least Dad's too dead to hear it. Michelle exits the bathroom.It doesn't matter what I write. All anybody's going to be thinking is \"why isn't Ryan doing the eulogy? Even I'm going to be thinking it. She holds him close.Soon. It's not ready to be read yet.I said I'd take care of it and I'll take care of it. Michelle looks frustrated and crosses into the bathroom.Hey, hey, hey. Are you serious? We have to do this today? Michelle is still on the ground.Can I at least find the body first?I just started.I'm trying.Do I have to do this today? The door opens and a HOUSEKEEPER sticks her head in.Oh shit, Uncle Russell. Aaron fixes his pants as he exits the room.I need you to pick up Uncle Russell.It's not a mood if he's always in it. It's his personality. Can you do it?Come on, man. You know that's my father.Mom, how are you feeling?China? You don't even like Chinese food.Come on, Mom. You're healthy. You'll be fine. You've got your friends and family... Cynthia, Aaron and Michelle stand around the coffin.He'll be here soon.I guess if people died every week, we'd see you all the time. Ryan turns to Aaron and Michelle.I'm alright.\"End up dead\"?When does dead beat sick?Well that explains why you never call.I guess it is.By the way, I'm going to need that money.The money for all this... the funeral. You're supposed to pay half.That's Mom's money.That's Mom's money.So we're spliting the cost.Yes. We are.So?What do you mean, you don't have it? You just bought a first class seat for your bag.It's your family. You don't recognize them from the last funeral? Ryan looks around the room.Who?I have no idea. Maybe a friend of Dad's from work or something. Aaron turns to Ryan.So, you're telling me I'm going to have to pay for the whole funeral?I'm not a God damn credit agency! REVEREND DAVIS, a very calm, serene woman, suddenly appears.Yes, um... We're just waiting for everyone to arrive, then we can get going. I know you're in a hurry.Have you met my brother, Ryan?No, no, I'm doing the eulogy.Look, I think you should do the eulogy. Everyone's expecting you to do it.Look most of the people are here for Dad, but let's not kid ourselves. A lot of them are here to hear your eulogy.Can we talk about this when there's a little less death in the air?Honey, I'm just not in the mood...What? You don't have any panties on? It's my father's funeral.Babe, don't make it obvious, but that guy in the leather jacket standing by the wall. Don't look. Don't look. Don't look. Michelle catches a glimpse of the guy.Do you recognize him?No, I don't think so. Don't look. Don't look.No, no, that's not it. He keeps looking at me. Don't look. Don't look.Oh, Ryan can you keep an eye out--Are you talking about Little Martina?Can you keep an eye out for Uncle Russell?Yeah, why don't you do that? See if she wants a juice box.Hello.Uh... thanks.Frank?... I don't think so, no... Were you a friend of his?Well, nice to meet you. Thanks for coming. Aaron walks away, leaving Frank alone.Sure. Can we just wait five minutes for my Uncle Russell? We can't start without him.As soon as Uncle Russell gets here we'll be ready to start.Yeah.Would you excuse me? Aaron walks away.Every single person wants Ryan to do the eulogy. He was my father, too. I'm supposed to do the damn eulogy! I'm the oldest. Where was Ryan when I was taking care of Dad?Come on, do I have to do this today?Yes! Come in! Michelle is frustrated.My father was an exceptional man... My father was-- Frank again approaches Aaron.Yeah, that's great. Do you mind if we do it later though? My uncle just got here.Thank you, Derek, you're a life saver. Hope it wasn't too much trouble.How are you doing, Uncle Russell?Stole your parking space?!. My father's dead! Act right. Reverend Davis looks at them then continues her speech.Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for coming... I never realized Dad was so popular. It looks like he's got more friends now that he's dead. Blank faces stare back at Aaron. Cynthia looks pained. Everyone is silent except for Oscar who laughs loudly. Elaine silences him with a look. Aaron composes himself and pulls his notes out.My father was an exceptional man... He was born in 1938. He grew up in Alabama on a farm. He loved to take long walks in the woods with his close friend, Bobby. He told me how they spent their summer days riding their bikes through the fields and swimming in the lake. As Aaron speaks, Reverend Davis looks concerned because the eulogy is so bad. She looks to Ryan who looks like \"what can I do?\" Jeff looks more concerned with Oscar, whose face is contorted with pain. He looks like he's going to burst. ANGLE ON: Aaron.Dad's first job was working after school as an assistant to an electrician named Mr. Thompson. Back then, Blacks weren't allowed to wear rubber gloves. So my father got shocked a lot. Because of that, he had no feeling in his fingertips. I asked my Dad what his first boss was like... The drugs have gotten the best of Oscar. He suddenly grabs Elaine's arm. Aaron keeps talking..He said he was a nice man, and surprisingly well dressed. When Dad was eighteen, he left home after an argument with his father. He never told me what that argument was about, but I do know that after leaving South Carolina, sadly he and Bob lost touch and never saw each other again. Dad went to college where he studied accounting, a decision which lead to a career in corporate finance... But his real passion was for the arts, with a particular fondness for theatre, dance and musicals. He was a charter member of the Negro Ensemble Company and contributed regularly to the Alvin Ailey School of Dance. Oscar's protests are getting louder. Duncan looks back at the disruption with a disapproving glare. Elaine looks at Jeff who watches, concerned.What are you doing?Elaine, what the hell was that?!Oh, okay. My dead father's sprawled out on the living room floor, but it's okay, you're sorry.No, I haven't made the call about the down payment yet.No I'm not going to have sex with you.What were you going to say?Norman, please.Why don't you show it to my Uncle Duncan? He's a doctor.It's alright. Aaron turns around not knowing what to do.I guess so.Oh yeah.Sure. They walk away. The screaming continues as Jeff, frantically, but slowly comes down the stairs re-tracing his steps and searching around for his lost bottle of pills.Uh... yeah. Aaron takes the manuscript and moves it away.Actually I'm the oldest. I was writing before.he was. I've had a few pieces published in the New Yorker. But now I'm mainly teaching.So anyway. What did you want to talk about? He motions for Frank to take a seat and sits across from him.Yeah. Okay. That's good.Yeah, well Dad was a fun guy. Frank takes an envelope out of his inside jacket pocket and takes some photos from the envelope.Sure. Frank passes the first photo.So, where did you and my dad meet?So... I mean you have all these pictures, but he never said anything about you. This is the first I'mHow did you know my father? Aaron looks around the room. There is a copy of \"People Magazine\" sexiest men issue on the table. He sees figurines of male ballet dancers. It's getting clearer. He sees three Robert Mapplethorpe photos on the wall. There's a signed Kathy Griffin 8x10. Frank looks around waiting for him to get it. Aaron looks at a framed movie poster for Australia with Hugh Jackman. Aaron looks back at the picture. He gets it.Oh God... Aaron jumps up and closes the study door.I had no idea.Uugg. Like this. Aaron gathers his senses. He has a thought and turns to Frank.Does my mother know?\"What's owed to you\"?What do you want?Thirty thousand dollars?! I can't just give you thirty thousand dollars. My wife and I are trying to have kids--You think you can come in here, slander my father's name and show me a few photos of you and my dad dressed up going to see \"Dreamgirls\"? I saw \"Dreamgirls\" twice. I'm not gay. That's not proof of anything... \"Steppin' to the bad side / Gonna take a mean ride.\"I'm not giving you anything but a-- Frank pulls out another photo and holds it up to Aaron's face. Aaron,releases Frank and snatches the picture.Wait here. He exits the study.Ryan, I need to talk to you.It's important.That guy that was here before, that we didn't recognize...Yeah.Well, I was just with him in the study, and... and he showed me some pictures...Pictures of him and Dad together at the premiere of \"Dreamgirls\". Ryan's face is blank. It's not registering.Ryan, he was Dad's lover!The guy in the leather jacket just showed me pictures of him and Dad together.Uugg. I know.You don't understand. If we don't give him the money, he's going to show Mom the picture.What do you mean, you think I should pay him the money? Where the hell is all your money?So after paying for the funeral, the clothes, the catering... Now I'm supposed to shell out thirty thousand dollars? He's your father, too.I have not been living off of them... I've been living with them.No I haven't paid rent, but Dad hasn't worked in five years. Who do you think has been paying all the bills?Would you mind giving us five minutes?Thanks. Aaron walks off followed by Ryan. He passes Michelle, who's sitting on the couch. She stands up.No. I'm really sorry, honey, but buying a condo is going to have to be put on hold, just for now.Babe, you know I wouldn't do this unless I had a good reason.I haven't got time right now, please. I'll explain later.Hey, hey, hey! Aaron rushes over and takes the manuscript away from Frank.What are you doing with my manuscript?! It's not ready. He puts it in the desk.What's that supposed to mean?Can we get to the point here?What?Yeah. So?That's it. I can't do it.There's no way in the world I'm giving him my hard earned money.He comes in today! Of all days, he picks the day of my father's funeral! Who the hell is he?So what. Who cares what he's got. Let him show the world. Put it on facebook. I don't care.Let's just get it over with. There's a long pause as everyone seems to be deciding what to do. Finally, Frank stands up.Ryan, what are you doing?What?! I'm not a serial killer. I don't keep rope and duct tape in my pocket.This is a really bad idea.What am I supposed to do with the tie?I don't know what to--Apparently everything but write a damn check.If I could tell everybody, it wouldn't be blackmail.Yeah, Ryan, what are we going to do with him? Ryan doesn't have any answers.You don't know?! Come on, you're the big writer. You're the one who came up with \"Black Hurt.\" Dream up something where we all live happily ever after. We can't keep him tied up forever. How long do you think those Valium are going to last?What?What?!Jeff, what the hell are you doing with this stuff?What friend, Amy Winehouse?Maybe we should call an ambulance.So what then? What's going to happen? Is he going to die?!Be out in a minute, Mom. Ryan looks at Norman and Jeff.Sure. So sorry. Um... can you just give us another five minutes? The reverend doesn't look too pleased.Why did you tie him up?!What is wrong with you? They start to argue.I'm not the one who tied him up.I couldn't leave because I had responsibilities.At least I'm not some hack writing crap. Mr. \"Mama's Secret\", Mr. \"Black Hurt.\"Michelle, please, not now.Listen... Do you remember the guy in the leather jacket?Well, I don't know how to say this, but... it looks like he and my father were having sex.Yes.And now he wants thirty thousand dollars or he's going to show everyone photos of them doing... stuff...Well, it's not that simple.Norman, why are you grinning like that?It's Aaron. Jeff opens the door. Norman, Ryan and Aaron enter. Norman locks the door behind them. Aaron rushes over to the body.Oh shit! Call an ambulance.What do you mean \"there's no point\"?!Dead, dead?What the hell did you do to him?Well he was alive when I left.Oh no. This is really bad. This is really, really bad.Twenty-five to life. Norman looks at his watch.Pull yourself together! Norman calms down.Didn't notice him? He's four fucking feet tall.Get rid of the body?! It took me two months to get rid of a couch.That's not the point.Norman!! Why is Uncle Russell on the toilet?How could you forget?! What the hell is wrong with you?! Another loud bang on the door.What is it?Nothing. Derek puts aside his curiosity for the time being.Wait here. Aaron follows Jeff, but he does not run. He walks out.I think I can get rid of this guy, but I need you to stay out here and try to stop anyone from coming in.It's Aaron! Norman opens the door.Everyone's out in the garden... We've gotta move the body now.We can't leave it like that.Be serious for a second. They begin lifting him again.Bye, Dad. Ryan takes a long look as he closes the coffin.Yeah.I'm so sorry, Uncle Russell. There was someone on the roof--What dead body?I can't believe what a nightmare today has been.Listen, about the condo and the baby,I can't believe I still have to do this eulogy... with everything I've just found out. A beat.Not a thing. Reverend Davis approaches Aaron, looking at her watch and appearing flustered.Sure. Let's go.My father... was an exceptional--My father was an exceptional man.Not only did he live for his family, but he was always there for others--He had his... shortcomings, but he took care of his family. He loved his family. He loved this house. He worked hard. All I wanted today was to show him how much we all loved and admired him. To give him the respect that he deserved... Is that really so much to ask? We all get so distracted by the... little things in life. We forget about the important things. Like the fact that we lost a great man. The mourners look up at Aaron with undivided attention.So maybe he loved \"Dreamgirls\" more than most men. We don't know why a man makes the choices he makes. But I do know that my father made the best choices he could make. Life is complicated. We're just thrown here together in a world filled with chaos and confusion... and we do our best. And Dad did his best... Aaron looks over at the coffin. As.he speaks, we see shots of Cynthia, Frank, Jeff, Norman, Duncan as they are moved by Aaron's words.He taught us to go for what we wanted in life, because you never know how long you're going to be here... And whether you succeed... or you fail... the important thing is that you tried.So when you all leave here today, I want you to remember Dad for who he really was... A decent, loving man who never condemned anyone for how they lived. Who never cast disparaging remarks or held prejudices against race, gender... height. If only we could all be as giving, as generous, as understanding as my father... Even dead, my father has more character than everyone in this room. If I am half the man my father was, my child will be incredibly blessed. Aaron turns and walks out of the room. Everyone watches him go. Michelle follows him out of the room.How's Mom?", "clean_line": "brian man looking cause father asking sure know father looks like man look damn body brian peers coffin asian man come brian know

okay?About seeing my dad?He doesn't hate you. He just loved Derek.At least you know it's not you, so try not to get so nervous when he's around.He's going to be more.concerned that his brother-in-law just died. He won't be focused on you. Anyway, when I tell him we're getting married, he'll have to accept you. Elaine takes his hand. As they exchange a loving look, Oscar takes his eyes off the road for just a brief moment. Suddenly there's a BUMP!!! And we see a bicyclist flying over Oscar's car. Oscar screeches to a halt. They jump out of the car.Oscar, calm down!You heard the man, he ran a light. Come on, let's get out of here before he wants to sue. She grabs him and pulls him into the car.Do you always open the door half naked? Come on, Jeff. We're going to be late.Oscar's freaked out. A guy on a bike ran into the car.It's okay, baby. Go put your damn pants on.Here. Take this..: It'll calm you down.It's just Valium. I used to take them all the time... It'll make you feel better, promise.It'll be okay. I'll drive, honey. Come on, open wide. She pops the pill in his mouth and hands him some water. Oscar swallows. Jeff returns wearing pants.Yeah. But he was sick for so long. He's much better off now.Shut up, Jeff. Jeff turns his attention to Oscar.What? He sniffs.What the hell are you talking about? Oscar falls silent and just goes back to looking out the window.Are you family, Norman?No such thing. Derek leans out the window.What are you doing here?Oh please. She grabs Oscar and heads to the house followed by Jeff.Oscar, are you alright?All this talking about phantom dogs and things being green... What's going on?I don't know. Something's not right... ANGLE ON: Oscar as he wanders around the yard.I think it's the Valium.I gave him a Valium at your place. I think he's just not used to it.It's so nice to see you.I'll see you inside. Jeff takes Elaine's arm with some urgency and moves off to the side.What? What is it?!What do you mean it's not Valium?This isn't funny, Jeff.What the hell are you doing leaving that stuff around your house?!I thought they were Valium! What am I supposed to do? Should I tell him?Hi, Dad. How are you? She gives him a kiss.He's my boyfriend. And you know his name. Derek approaches.I'm so sorry, Auntie. We're going to miss Uncle Edward so much.Oscar, this is my Aunt-- Oscar grabs Cynthia in a tight hug.I don't know. I can't leave. Aunt Cynthia would never speak to me again. Jeff notices that Oscar has left. He rushes outside. Elaine follows. Derek follows suit.I'm dressed for a funeral.Hey, hey. I don't really have time to deal with whatever happened between you and me. But I have not told my dad yet, so I would appreciate it if you would keep your mouth shut.Yep, that's him. Oscar who has been walking in circles with a look of awe on his face, changes direction and flies by Elaine and Derek back into the house with Jeff in tow.Norman, shut up. Elaine turns back around. Norman is irritated by this.'Cause you're not.See what?What?Oscar, please- People start looking at Oscar, who's becoming increasingly vocal, and looking increasingly like someone on acid.Oscar, please sit down. Oscar ignores her and walks purposefully towards the coffin. People watch him in astonishment, including Jeff.Ryan, no!I'm so sorry, Aaron.Please, Aaron. Go back inside. I'll explain later. An annoyed and confused Aaron turns and walks back to the house. He's almost to the door when Michelle arrives.Dad, leave it alone!It wasn't his fault.I can't do that.Because we're... moving in together. Duncan looks over at Oscar, who looks like he's just seen a ghost. He's struggling to stand up straight, with Jeff who's doing his best to look after him.Dad, this isn't actually what he's like. He took some drugs and--No he's not on the pipe. He took some Valium and had a.bad reaction. Jeff looks grateful.Dad, please.Not right now, Dad.Oscar.Come and sit down.Oscar, listen to me. I need to tell you something... Elaine sits him down on the bench.Now... You remember I gave you some Valium earlier?Well it turns out that it wasn't actually Valium. Oscar just looks at Elaine. Jeff slinks off into the background.Can you hear me?Do you understand? Hallucinogenic. Oscar recoils. He turns to Jeff.Oscar! She tries to pull him off Jeff.Oscar let go. She pulls him off Jeff. ANGLE ON: Derek watching from the window.Oscar! Come back. They head into the house.Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.Excuse me. He's going to be sick. They head up the stairs with Jeff following.Oscar. Oscar grabs the hair-dryer and wields it like a gun.Oscar, put down the dryer.Oscar, please-- Oscar shuts the door and locks it.Oscar, are you okay? She tries to open the door, but it's locked. Jeff walks up checking his pockets.Oscar, let me in.Oscar. Oscar?Oscar! Open the door. Jeff looks at the floor as he leaves.Open the door. Oscar.Oscar. Are you alright?Oscar. Open the door. Derek arrives behind her and leans in close.Not really, thanks. Derek moves over to face her and leans his arm on the door very coolly.Oscar? Anguished noises emanate from the bathroom.Oscar! Open the door.Look... I'm busy. I don't have time for your shit. Now get the hell away from me! Derek looks hurt and storms off.Oscar!Oscar?Oscar? She tries the door. It's still locked.Oscar?Oscar.Os...Tell me about it... How's Aaron?The guy's father just died. Don't you think this is a bad day for sex?I'm sorry. At least your husband didn't ruin the funeral.What do you want, Derek?Please don't make me go through this again.No. The reason I don't want to go out with you is because it was a mistake. I was drunk off my ass. You could have been a donkey.That wasn't a compliment. I'm saying I couldn't remember it.A minute, huh? That's why I don't remember.Okay, well for one thing, he's responsible. He's caring. He's considerate. He's thoughtful. He's stable. He's--Yeah, well, we all make mistakes... I used to be convinced I was going to marry Prince. What happened there?You're an idiot.Yes, but maybe I don't think of life anymore as all about me, me, me. Maybe I've discovered there's something outside of myself that I care about. And maybe you should, too. Derek looks hurt.No, Derek, you care about you. You only care about me in relation to how I affect you. There's a difference.Derek, get over yourself.Oscar!Oscar! What are you doing? Get back here and put your clothes on right now!I wasn't kissing him. I swear. Please, baby, put your clothes on. We're at a funeral! Derek sticks his head out the window behind Elaine.Calm down.Remember you've got drugs in you. This isn't really happening. Oscar, look at me. She turns to Derek.Oscar, please. Come back here.Get back here. Be careful!Oscar, come inside. We'll have some coffee.Oscar! She climbs out the window.Oscar... Please don't do this... love you.I wasn't with him.Oscar, please just come inside.Come with me.Because you're going to be a father. Oscar looks at her, shocked.I'm pregnant. We're going to have a child... ANGLE ON: Oscar and Elaine.I won't be able to do it without you. Very slowly, a naked Oscar, walks toward her and they embrace. The crowd applauds.
