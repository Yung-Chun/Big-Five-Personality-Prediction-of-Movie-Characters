Artoo-Detoo, where are you?At last! Where have you been?They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!Wait a minute, where are you going?Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure..Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you.Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there!I'm going to regret this.That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here.Are you sure this things safe?How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life.I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen.What a desolate place this is.Where are you going?Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier.What makes you think there are settlements over there?Don't get technical with me.What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it.No more adventures. I'm not going that way.That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved!Over here! Help! Please, help!Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!Wake up! Wake up!We're doomed.Do you think they'll melt us down?Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end?Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter... very similar to your vaporators. You could say...Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me... I'm as fluent in Bocce...Shutting up, sir.Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain.Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes.Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!Is there anything I might do to help?I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.I see, sir.I see, sir Luke.And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.What is what?!? He asked you a question... What is that?Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind.I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to...Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master.He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards!I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.Just you reconsider playing that message for him.No, I don't think he likes you at all.No, I don't like you either.It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times.Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?Oh, he excels at that, sir.Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.Deactivate! Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt...Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.Where am I? I must have taken a bad step...I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for.Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures.Come along, Artoo.I heartily agree with you sir.I don't like the look of this.Lock the door, Artoo.I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all the trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.You watch your language!Hello, sir.Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.Now be careful, Artoo.He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you.But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.We found the computer outlet, sir.He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says \"I found her\", and keeps repeating, \"She's here.\"Princess Leia.Level five. Detention block A A-twenty- three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?That isn't very reassuring.Yes sir?I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out; all other information on your level is restricted.Oh, no!They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them.Come on!Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance.They aren't here! Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured.Hurry!Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where could they be?Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off!Are you there, sir?We've had some problems...No. Shut them all down! Hurry!Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master!For the moment. Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.Where could they be?Come on, Artoo, we're going!Oooh!Help! I think I'm melting! This is all your fault.Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back.You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?Hang on, Artoo!Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say something! You can repair him, can't you?You must repair him!

Come with me! What are you waiting for?! Get in gear!Shape it up you guys!... Biggs?I didn't know you were back! When did you get in?The Academy didn't change you much...but you're back so soon? Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?I almost forgot. There's a battle going on! Right here in our system. Come and look!There they are!But there was a lot of firing earlier...Hey, easy with those......so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail. I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty upset. He grounded me for the rest of the season. You should have been there... it was fantastic.Look who's talking. Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft in the city...Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs. It's been so... quiet.What are you talking about?Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding! How?I'm sorry. I'm quiet. Listen how quiet I am. You can barely hear me...You're crazy! You could wander around forever trying to find them.And I'm stuck here...Not likely! I had to cancel my application. There has been a lot of unrest among the Sandpeople since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off. He needs me for just one more season. I can't leave him now.It couldn't happen here. You said it yourself. The Empire won't bother with this rock.I wish I was going... Are you going to be around long?Then I guess I won't see you.Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows. I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure... Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got.It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come on, Red, let's go.Uncle Owen...This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!Uncle Owen...What about that one?Yeah, take it away.Okay, let's go.It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here!Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.Uh, you can call me Luke.Just Luke.Hello.You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?Have you been in many battles?Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a cruiser or...What's this?Who is she? She's beautiful.Is there more to this recording?Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?Well, I don't know anyone named Obi- Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit.I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing.H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay.There you go.Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message.All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back.You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?He knew my father?Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.Sure, there're more than enough droids.But it's a whole 'nother year.Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids.What are you doing hiding there?Oh, no!How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it!It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning.All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.How's that.Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far. We must have missed him. Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.Sure. He needs you. He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator.Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?Well, come on. It's getting late. I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.No, he's not going to try anything.What's wrong with him now?Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on.There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now.What happened?Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you!Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master... I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead.You know him!Then the droid does belong to you.Threepio!Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return.No, you're not. What kind of talk is that?No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter.You fought in the Clone Wars?I wish I'd known him.Sure, go ahead.What is it?How did my father die?The Force?I saw part of the message he was...Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them home!Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.About three or four seasons.Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got by those troopers. I thought we were dead.Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?I'm ready for anything.What?Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble.I'm sorry.I'll be careful than.Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that!You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself! We don't have to sit here and listen...That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again.He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they're just not in demand.What a piece of junk.Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast.Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining...What's that flashing?Are you all right? What's wrong?You mean it controls your actions?You don't believe in the Force, do you?With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight?You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote.What's going on?What do you mean? Where is it?What? How?Maybe they know what happened.It followed us!It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble.It must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something.Look at him. He's headed for that small moon.I have a very bad feeling about this.Why are we still moving towards it?But there's gotta be something you can do!Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.I want to go with you.But he can...Ben is a great man.I didn't hear you give any ideas...Who do you think...What is it?Well, who... who has he found?The princess? She's here?Oh, no! We've got to do something.The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message... We've got to help her.But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay.But they're going to kill her!She's rich.Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...Well more wealth that you can imagine.You'll get it!You will...All right.Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you?Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on you.Okay. Han, you put these on.Lock the door!I can't see a thing in this helmet.Why didn't you say so before?Prisoner transfer from Block one-one- three-eight.He's going to pull us all apart.What? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi.Come on!See-Threepio! See-Threepio!We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?... What was that? I didn't copy!There isn't any other way out.Well, I didn't...No! wait!Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed!There's something alive in here!Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that?Help!Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed.Anywhere! Oh!!I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...The walls are moving!Wait a minute!Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be?Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come in?Threepio!Will you shut up and listen to me? Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy?Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.Threepio, we're all right!We're all right. You did great.Hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we?Well, let's get moving!See-Threepio, do you copy?We're right above you. Stand by.Where are you going? Come back!What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on!I think we took a wrong turn.That oughta hold it for a while.Oh, I think I just blasted it.Here, hold this.Is the ship all right?Look!No!I can't believe he's gone.They're coming in too fast!Got him! I got him!That's it! We did it!I care!So... what do you think of her, Han?Good...No!It's not impossible. I used to bull's- eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. They're not much bigger than two meters.So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind.I only wish Ben were here.Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there with you! Listen, have I got some stories to tell...Thank you, sir. I'll try.I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together.

{"raw_line": "Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid.Don't worry, he'll be all right.Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece.The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far?Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.Oh, he's not dead, not... not yet.Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting...I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.Quickly, son... they're on the move.That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me...I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire.A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from.I seem to have found it.You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.That's your uncle talking.Learn about the Force, Luke.You must do what you feel is right, of course.They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers.And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous.There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire.Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.They're for sale if you want them.You don't need to see his identification.These are not the droids your looking for.He can go about his business.Move along.The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You will find it a powerful ally.Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough.This little one isn't worth the effort. Come let me buy you something...This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship.Should I have?Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.We haven't that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.Ninety-four.You'll have to sell your speeder.It will be enough.If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.How long before you can make the jump to light speed?I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened.You'd better get on with your exercises.Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.Partially. But it also obeys your commands.I suggest you try it again, Luke.This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.Stretch out with your feelings.You see, you can do it.In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.That's good. You have taken your first step into a larger world.Destroyed... by the Empire!It's an Imperial fighter.No. It's a short range fighter.It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range.A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.That's no moon! It's a space station.You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting.Leave that to me!Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone.Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids.They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path than mine. The Force will be with you... always!Only a master of evil, Darth.You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.", "clean_line": "hello come little friend afraid worry ll right rest easy son ve busy day fortunate piece jundland wastes traveled lightly tell young luke brings far obi wan kenobi obi wan thats haven heard long time long time oh dead course course know haven gone obi wan oh born remember owning droid interesting think better indoors sandpeople easily startled soon greater numbers quickly son uncle told hold father ideals thought stayed gotten involved yes jedi knight father best star pilot galaxy cunning warrior understand ve good pilot good friend reminds father wanted old uncle wouldn allow feared follow old obi wan damned fool idealistic crusade like father fathers lightsaber weapon jedi knight clumsy random blaster elegant weapon civilized time thousand generations jedi knights guardians peace justice old republic dark times empire young jedi named darth vader pupil turned evil helped empire hunt destroy jedi knights betrayed murdered father jedi extinct vader seduced dark force force gives jedi power energy field created living things surrounds penetrates binds galaxy let figure little friend come learn ways force come alderaan need help luke needs help getting old sort thing uncle talking learn force luke feel right course meant think tracks sandpeople ride single file hide numbers blast points accurate sandpeople imperial stormtroopers precise wait luke dangerous luke killed droids hands empire mos eisley spaceport wretched hive scum villainy cautious sale want need identification droids looking business force strong influence weak minded powerful ally best freighter pilots watch step place little rough little isn worth effort come let buy chewbacca mate ship suit needs yes fast ship passengers boy droids questions asked let like avoid imperial entanglements haven pay thousand plus reach alderaan ninety ll sell speeder ship fast boasting ought long jump light speed felt great disturbance force millions voices suddenly cried terror suddenly silenced fear terrible happened better exercises remember jedi feel force flowing partially obeys commands suggest try luke time let conscious self act instinct eyes deceive trust stretch feelings experience thing luck good taken step larger world destroyed empire imperial fighter short range fighter let far range fighter size couldn deep space moon space station win alternatives fighting leave foolish fool fool follows plug able interpret entire imperial network think boys help patient luke stay watch droids delivered safely star systems suffer fate alderaan destiny lies different path force master evil darth win darth strike shall powerful possibly imagine"}, "HAN": {"raw_line": "Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo?What is it? Some kind of local trouble?Well, that's the trick, isn't it? And it's going to cost you something extra. Ten thousand in advance.But who's going to fly it, kid! You?Seventeen, huh!Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're ready. Docking bay Ninety-four.Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready.Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money.Yeah, but this time I got the money.I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?Over my dead body.Yes, I'll bet you have.Sorry about the mess.I've been waiting for you, Jabba.I'm not the type to run.You sent Greedo to blast me.I think he thought he was. Next time don't send one of those twerps. If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice, but I've got a charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra. I just need some more time.Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure.She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself.We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.Chewie, get us out of here!It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.Stay sharp! There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!Here's where the fun begins!It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em.Don't everyone thank me at once.Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.I call it luck.Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That's something else.Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines.What the...? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts.Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away.The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...There's another ship coming in.There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from?Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions.Not for long...Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.It's too big to be a space station.Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in!There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a fight!I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already.Boy you said it, Chewie.Where did you dig up that old fossil?Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up...Princess? What's going on?What are you talking about?Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here.I'm not going anywhere.Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.Better her than me...Rich?What?I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!I better!All right, kid. But you'd better be right about this.What's your plan?Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind.And hope they don't have blasters.This is not going to work.I did say so before!Look out! He's loose!Go get him!We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold them here.Everything is under control. Situation normal.Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you. How are you?Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak... very dangerous.Boring conversation anyway. Luke! We're going to have company!Chewie!Get behind me! Get behind me!Can't get out that way.Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.I can't hold them off forever! Now what?He's the brains, sweetheart.What the hell are you doing?Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it.Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there!Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there...Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here. You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.It's worse.That's your imagination.What?Luke! Luke! Luke!Where?Luke! Luke!I've got a very bad feeling about this.Get to the top!One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner! Get on top of it!Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.Where are you going?Come here, you big coward!Chewie! Come here!Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! I take orders from one person! Me!No reward is worth this.There she is.Nice! Come on!Get back to the ship!Didn't we just leave this party?What kept you?Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.Now's our chance! Go!Come on!Blast the door! Kid!I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it!We're coming up on the sentry ships. Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns!Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!Don't worry, she'll hold together.You hear me, baby? Hold together!Great kid! Don't get cocky.Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.Easy... you call that easy?Not this ship, sister.What's so important? What's he carrying?It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money!I'm trying not to, kid!Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me...That's right, yeah! I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. I could use you.What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like suicide.Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you!What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doing.Yahoo!You're all clear, kid.Now let's blow this thing and go home!Great shot, kid. That was one in a million.Hey!
