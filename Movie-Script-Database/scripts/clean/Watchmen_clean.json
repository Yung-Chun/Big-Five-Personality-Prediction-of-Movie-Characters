{"Watchmen": {"RORSCHACH": {"raw_line": "Rorschach's Journal, October 12th. Earlier today I came across what appeared to be a suicide. It was later learned to be a homicide. Someone's time was up. Still in POV, we see the person pull something from his pocket--the happy face pin. We realize that this was the person whose POV we were in earlier.I discovered a clue. Something I recognized. And suddenly, unexpectedly . I heard my own clock ticking. We move out of the POV and see our guy for the first time-- RORSCHACH --a masked vigilante who wears a trench coat, fedora, and a silver-white MASK with oily BLACK SPOTS moving about, creating shifting, doubled PATTERNS like a Rorschach test. Scary looking. Rorschach draws a hydraulic GRAPPLING GUN from his coat, and FIRES the HOOK AND CABLE THIRTY STORIES UP where it latches itself through Blake's broken window. Pressing RETRACT, Rorschach FLIES UP THE WALL to the 30th floor.Hello Daniel. I helped myself to some beans. You don't mind?No need.Minor wound. Won't need hospitalization.Out of prison. So far. Look at this. He tosses Blake's happy face pin onto the table. Dan picks it up, runs his fingers over the RED-BROWN SPLOTCH.Human bean juice. It belonged to the Comedian. He's dead.Murder. Someone threw him out a window.An ordinary burglar? Kill the Comedian? Ridiculous.Maybe. Or maybe someone's decided to kill off costumed heroes.Is that what they're saying about me now? That I'm paranoid?One of our own has been murdered. I thought you might be interested. An attack on one is an attack on all of us, right? Dan hesitates.Yes. I know that. Anyways, I thought I'd let you know. Just in case.I remember. Used to come here a lot. Back when we were partners.You quit. Rorschach disappears into the SUBWAY TUNNEL, leaving Dan to reminisce alone. Dan glances at his old costume hanging.Quiet, whore.Dr. Manhattan. Dr. Manhattan continues about his business when his girlfriend, LAURIE JUPITER, 30, very much in her prime, enters from the other end.Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.Sorry, Miss Jupiter. I thought I should tell you the bad news--the Comedian has been murdered.I have my own theories. But neither of you seem too concerned.Sounds like you may have had a score to settle. You or your mother.--I'm not here to judge the moral discrepancies of a man who died in service of his country.I came here to warn you both, just like I warned Adrian and Dan. I believe someone may be targeting masked heroes--It took a lot of effort to get in here. I'm not leaving before I've-- With a look, Dr. Manhattan makes Rorschach disappear.--had my say Rorschach realizes what just happened. Checks himself, his surroundings. Reorients himself. With nothing else he can do, he heads down the road.That's true. But something like this seems too big. Too bureaucratic.Of course it does. Justice matters.Edgar William Jacobi. Also known as Edgar William Vaughn. Also known as William Edgar Bright. Also known as Moloch.Lie again, I'll break your arm.You attended a funeral today. Why?How did you know Blake was the Comedian?You were enemies for forty years. Why would he visit you?The Comedian? Crying?What did he say?!Scared of what?!Hm. Funny story. Sounds unbelievable. Probably true. Rorschach glances around the kitchen. He opens some drawers, looking inside. He picks up a stack of MAIL, flips through it. One of the envelopes contains a PENSION CHECK from \"Pyramid Industries.\"Clean? I searched your house. Found illegal drugs.Laetril. Phony medication made from apricot pits. Illegal.What kind of cancer?Fine. You're off the hook, for now. If you remember anything else, leave me a note in the trash can opposite the Gunga Diner at Fortieth and Seventh. Keep out of trouble, Moloch.Rorschach's Journal, October 17th. Thought about Moloch's story on my way to the cemetery. Could all be lies. A scheme for revenge planned during his years behind bars. CUT WIDE: To reveal he is actually PERCHED ATOP AN ELEVATED SUBWAY CAR. Just one way he gets around.But if it's true, then what? What could have possibly scared the Comedian? What building was he talking about? What was it that he saw? So many questions.Edward Blake--the Comedian. Born 1944, buried in the rain. Murdered. FLASH TO: Blake, the night of his murder, turning as his door is kicked in.Violent lives ending violently. FLASH TO: Adrian's display burning.Blake understood. Humans are violent in nature. No matter how much you try to dress it up, to disguise it. FLASHES OF: The group photo of the old Watchmen. Then the photo of the new Watchmen.Blake saw the true face of human kind and chose to become a parody of it, treated it like a joke. FLASHES OF: Blake being beaten in his apartment.I heard a joke once. Man goes to a doctor, says he's depressed. Life seems harsh and cruel. Blake is KICKED in the stomach.Says he feels all alone in a threatening world. Blake stands alone in the blowing tear gas smoke.Doctor says, \"the treatment is simple. The great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up.\" Blake is lifted up by the Intruder's hands.The man bursts into tears. A bloodied Blake laughs at the Intruder.\"But doctor,\" he says. ULTRA-SLOW, Blake crashes through his apartment window.\"I am Pagliacci.\" Blake FLIES TOWARD FRAME on his silent trip to the ground.Good joke. Everybody laugh. Blake FALLS INTO FRAME--GO BLACK .Good morning, Daniel. I brought in your paper. Dan reads the headline: \"DR. MANHATTAN LEAVES EARTH.\"The Comedian murdered. Dr. Manhattan exiled. Two of us gone within a week. Who's next? Veidt? Ms. Jupiter? Me? You? Rorschach turns for the door as Dan reads the story.By the way, that new lock broke after one shove.Get a stronger one, Daniel. You can't be too security conscious these days.These days nobody's safe. We see the same Pakistani Soldiers from before, only now there are dozens more TROOPS with them, mobilizing on the border as are their Indian counterparts--Rorschach's Journal, October 19th. Someone tried to kill Adrian Veidt. Proves mask killer theory--the murderer is closing in. Pyramid Industries is the key. Rorschach approaches a TRASH CAN. He rummages through it and finds an ENVELOPE. He opens it and finds a NOTE that reads: \"Tonight 11:30, M.\"Checked mail drop, got a message from Moloch. Was just going to pay him a visit. Rorschach turns down an alley, approaches a DUMPSTER. He reaches behind the dumpster.My things are where I left them. My coat. My gloves. my face. Rorschach pulls his mask on, FILLING THE SCREENSomebody tried to shoot the world's smartest man today, Moloch. Moloch sits at the kitchen table. CLOSE ON: MOLOCH'S HAND. An ignored CIGARETTE smolders. In his other hand, a NOTE.The hitman worked for Pyramid Industries. So did Janey Slater and everyone else Dr. Manhattan allegedly gave cancer to. And last time I was here, I saw a pension check sent to you from the same company-- obviously a front set up by whoever it is that killed the Comedian, that pushed Dr. Manhattan over the edge, that wants us masks dead. Is that why you left me a note in my mail drop? You have something to confess? Rorschach turns. A HOLE gapes between Moloch's staring eyes. A PISTOL lies on the table--Moloch's dead. Rorschach carefully pulls the NOTE from Moloch's hand. It's the note Rorschach had left in Moloch's refrigerator, the one that reads: \"LOOK BEHIND YOU.\" Behind Rorschach, BLINDING LIGHT GLARES THROUGH THE WINDOW.No.No. No, no, noFramed. Set up. Walked right into it. Stupid, stupid, stupid.Heh. Never. Never surrender. Rorschach takes an AEROSOL CAN and a PEPPER SHAKER.When you areTen years. I've waited for this. He beckons them forward. The cops PILE INTO HIM. Rorschach brutally disables six cops before he is overwhelmed.No pain. Must get up. Find who framed me-- A Cop KICKS HIM in the throat. Rorschach drops again.No no no NO NO NO! The Cop peels back the shifting mask to reveal the Homeless Man from the news stand. He screams at them wildly.My face! Give it back to me! Rorschach is finally beaten, surrounded by cops, as Moloch's house blazes in the background.No. The Psychiatrist sits back, considering Rorschach carefully.A prison is a prison.A pretty butterfly. The Psychiatrist holds up another blot-card.Some nice flowers. The Psychiatrist eyes him, dubious. Holds up another card. FLASH OF: Rorschach as a little boy looking up at TWO OLDER BOYS, teasing him. Calling him \"son of a whore.\" Rorschach just wants to be left alone when one of the Boys SPITS in his face. Suddenly, Rorschach's face changes. He attacks the Boy like a wild animal--biting, clawing .Clouds. The Psychiatrist sighs, puts the cards down.Why are you here with me, doctor?There's other men in here with behavior more extreme than mine. Of course, they're not famous. You want to know about Rorschach, doctor? I'll tell you about RorschachI was investigating a kidnap case. Blair Roche, 6 year old girl. I was young then. Too soft on criminals. I let them live.Broke a man's arm to get a tip. Led me to the missing girl's location.I knew the girl was here. But when I searched the place I found nothing.And then I found her.It was dark when the murderer got back. As dark as it gets.Men get arrested. Rorschach RAISES THE CLEAVER, high over his headA tremor of impact shook my arm. Warm blood splashed my face. It was Walter Kovacs who screamed, who closed his eyes-- it was Rorschach who opened them again. The silence reels out RORSCHACH You see, Doctor. God didn't kill that little girl, fate didn't butcher her and destiny didn't feed her to those dogs. If God saw what any of us did that night, he didn't seem to mind. From then on, I knew. God doesn't make the world this way. We do. The Psychiatrist rises shakily. He crosses to the GUARD.None of you understand. I'm not locked up in here with you. Rorschach is placidly dragged off INTO DARKNESSYou're locked up in here with me.Big Figure. Small world.Tall order.Fat chance. The Fat Thug reddens. He DIVES forward, HANDS SWIPING for Rorschach.Your hands. My pleasure. Rorschach SNAPS Fat Thug's pinky fingers. Fat Thug SHRIEKS. Rorschach roughly binds the fingers around the bars. Dumb Thug tries to reach the welder around Fat Thug's body.One-nothing. Come and get me.Hmm. Never disposed of sewage with a toilet before. Obvious, really. Big Figure looks very small and alone nowTwo-nothing. Your move. Panic stricken, Big Figure moves, or rather, runs. Rorschach calmly follows him out of the cell.Hello, Daniel, Ms. Jupiter. Excuse me, I just have to visit the men's room. He disappears into the dark bathroom. Laurie watches after him in stunned disbelief.We can leave now. He walks off.Good Advice. I'm sure there are many who'd agree with you. Behind them: BLOODY WATER FLOODS from the bathroom door as they go.Good to see you in uniform, Daniel. What happened? Finally taking the mask-killer seriously?Of course you haven't been attacked yet. Funny, most everyone else has.I believe so. Rorschach sits in the pilot's seat. Dan turns to Laurie, high on adrenaline and love. Dan moves in to kiss her--Daniel.I don't think this can wait.No time for heartbreak, Daniel.Tactical error, Daniel.I hate this. How long are we going to stay down here? Daniel! Dan says nothing. Rorschach puts on his costume.You're letting fear paralyze you. And that woman--Unnecessary? Cowering in the sludge, from the authorities, that's unnecessary. Rorschach pulls his mask on, turns.While we waste time, the mask-killer gets closer. We need to get to Pyramid Industries. Dan sits at the COMPUTER.Sitting at a computer? No. We need to trace the killer--hit up underworld contacts, squeeze people. You've forgotten how we do things. You've been lazing around too long.You are a good friend. I'm sorry that it is sometimes difficult with me. Touched, Dan shakes his hand. An awkward, lovely moment.You sure this is the correct location, Daniel?Daniel.Daniel. Rorschach is looking down at something. Dan heads over and sees a DEAD BODY in the early stages of decomposition. He turns the body over--bullet between the eyes just like Moloch . but we recognize the corpse--it's journalist Doug Roth.Yes. Doug Roth. Journalist who grilled Dr. Manhattan on national television.Hmm. Journalist set up Dr. Manhattan, was probably working to set up Veidt also. Dan stands there thinking. As if hit with an epiphany. He opens his mouth like he can't believe what he's going to say.Veidt? Behind everything? Makes no sense.That doesn't explain the attempt on Veidt's life.But why?Not now, Daniel.Rorschach's Journal. Final entry? Dreiberg is convinced that Veidt is behind everything. Apparently, the Owl- Ship is capable of the trip to Antarctica, but are we? I cannot imagine a more dangerous opponent. Veldt is faster than Dreiberg and myself. He used to joke that he was fast enough to catch a bullet. I believe he could. He could kill us both, alone in' the snow. No one would know. Rorschach descends the ladder, goes to the door of the building. He places his JOURNAL in an ENVELOPE.I have done my best to make this legible. Whether I am alive or dead upon this reading, know that whatever the nature of this conspiracy--Adrian Veldt is responsible. He drops the envelope into the MAIL SLOT, climbs back up the ladder.I appreciate your recent support and hope the world survives long enough for this to reach you. For my own part, I regret nothing. I have lived my life free of compromise, and step now into the shadow without complaint. Rorschach. October 21st.The engines--Fine like this.Hitler was a vegetarian. If you're squeamish, leave him to me. We won't get a second chance.He's not. Listen to his voice.Impersonated Dr. Manhattan. Murdered millions of people. Call off your cat. Call off your cat and face me!No, don't let him escape!You're joking, of course. Rorschach walks toward the exit.Never. Not even in the face of Armageddon. Never compromise. Adrian and Jon's eyes meet--an unspoken communication. Seeing this, Dan runs after Rorschach.Back to the Owl-Ship. Back to America. People must be told. Evil must be punished.Suddenly you've rediscovered humanity? If you had cared from the start, none of this would be necessary. None of this would have happened. So what are you waiting for?

way. We see who Hollis is speaking to--DAN DREIBERG , late 30's, handsome, though he's let himself go the past few years--his edges have gone soft. He was in the photo of the new Watchmen in Blake's apartment.The Big Figure.Wow, it's really late. Dan stands, finishes his beer. Hollis sees him to the door.That's bullshit, Hollis, and you know it. They hug.What?Rorschach. Rorschach sits at the table, mask half up, eating a cold CANNo, of course not. You uh, want me to heat some up for you?You were on the news. They say you attacked a cop.Other than that . How have you been keeping?This little stain, is that bean juice or--The Comedian? Nervous now, Dan glances out the window. DAN Let's talk downstairs.How did it happen?Maybe it was a burglary. The killer might not have known who Blake was.You're right. I heard he was working for the government. Maybe it was a political killing.You don't think that's . a little paranoid?I-'m just saying the Comedian made a lot of enemies over the years, even amongst his friends, if he had any. The man wasn't exactly endearing. Just because something happened to him doesn't mean it involves us.I'm out, Rorschach. I've been out, we've all been out. Except you. You know that.Yeah, thanks. You can take the tunnel out to the warehouse on Fleet street-- Rorschach turns to walk off down a long, dark TUNNEL.Yeah. Those were good times, Rorschach. Great times. What ever happened to them?I'm here to see Adrian Veidt.No, uh, just tell him Dan Dreiberg is here to see him.I understand, but if you would just tell Adrian that Dan Dreiberg is here, I'm an old friend.Just tell him I'm here. I assure you he'll see me. Dan glares at her. She glares right back. A game of chicken. She reluctantly gets up, goes inside the office. Once she's gone, Dan's glare disappears, replaced by nervousness. Because he's not sure if Adrian will see him-- it's been a long time. He glances at the SECURITY GUARDS eyeing him. Finally, the Assistant returns.You look good, Adrian.He did? Must've been tough to get past your security, even for him. I thought your assistant was going to take me out.You're the world's smartest man, Adrian. You tell me.Yeah, he tried that with me once. I just walked away but he starts following me down the street in broad daylight yelling, \"punish me! punish me!\"Uh, well, he pulled that on Rorschach and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft. They look at each other, serious, then explode in laughter.It's great seeing you again, Laurie.You sure I can't get that?They've been watching the whole time?How is Jon, by the way?You're probably right.Uh, yeah. Awful.Yeah. I'd really like that. Laurie crosses the street and gets into the sedan. As Dan watches the car drive off, TWO KIDS nearly bump into him, running around playing. The Kids make flying noises.Maybe we should agree on no drinking at meetings. Look, Rorschach and I have made real headway on the gang problem by pooling our efforts. Rorschach's voice is quiet, not yet its tortured rasp.Oh God.Comedian, this is a nightmare! The whole city is erupting!How long can we keep this up?Protection from what? Blake laughs, exultant in the blowing smoke, the chaos.Who is it?Laurie? It takes a few moments for him to open the door.Sorry, I had a new lock installed, it's a little sticky--Did, uh, the Secret Service follow you here?I'm really sorry, Laurie.Not at all. I was just going to see Hollis for our weekly beer session. You're more than welcome to join. In fact, I insist They pass the news stand from the opening scene. The Homeless Man is arguing with the News Vendor:Laurie, will you please stop apologizing? I'm here for you anytime. SHADOWS trail behind them, ominous. Someone's following.Why don't you come by Hollis' with me? Shake off the adrenaline.I know, you won't believe it--Wait, what? Dan turns to the TV, which replays the clip of Dr. Manhattan being accosted and then teleporting everyone to the roof.I was just with Laurie. She doesn't know.Jesus! RorschachMy new lock?Adrian, I need to talk to you. Adrian looks put off.But what about what happened with ion? Adrian excuses himself from his Assistant.Rorschach came to see me again. Maybe there's something to this mask killer thing.Adrian! BANG! The man SHOOTS the Assistant in the gut; Adrian immediately springs into action--he moves with unbelievable speed and quickness, grabbing a velvet ROPE-STANCHION-- --DEFLECTING A SECOND BULLET with it-- --and SMASHING IT INTO THE FACE OF THE ASSASSIN, knocking him into a FOUNTAIN. SECURITY GUARDS run, guns drawn, toward the fountain where Adrian GRAPPLES with the dazed man.Talking to the cops. Thank god he's still in great shape. You get so caught up with the whole smartest man in the world thing you forget what a physical specimen he is- -he's as fast as I've ever seen himListen, why don't you . how about you stay at my place?It wouldn't be an imposition, I have an extra room. We're friends. And with everything that's been happeningI don't know. But it can't hurt to be safe. Besides, I've already had one wanted person visit me, another one won't make a difference. They look at each other. Laurie smiles.Some local low-life named Roy ChessNoon. Thought I'd let you sleep in. Laurie smiles at him. Is Dan crazy or does he sense a spark? She touches his shoulder as she turns into the living room, then turns on the TV:He wasn't always like that. We were a great team--tactically, he was brilliant. But I don't know, something about this murder charge I just can't see Rorschach shooting Moloch.Don't remind me, I made that thing for him. But a regular gun just seems too . ordinaryOh sure. The old Manhattan Transfer.Well, not to his face. Laurie laughs.Laurie?! Dan BOLTS for the basement door, thoughts of the mask-killer on his mind.Where are you?! Dan SPRAYS the fire. Laurie stumbles from the smoke, out of the Owl-Ship. Dan's got the fire under control now.I don't smoke. Are you hurt?Ah, that's mostly just soot. Archie's pretty resilient.Maybe, but the Comedian murdered; Jon exiled; Someone tries to shoot Adrian; Rorschach gets arrested. It makes me uneasy.My Dad was in corporate banking. He left me quite a bit. Which always surprised me.Mugging. He was shot. As Dan cleans up, Laurie watches him, like she's seeing him for the first time.Huh? Well, yeah, of course I worry about you, I mean, we're, y'know, friends-- Laurie takes off his glasses . and KISSES him. It's what Dan's been wanting all this time . but he pulls away.Sorry, IMask killers. War. Nuclear annihilation. I feel so powerless, so I've been afraid of this damn costume. Afraid of how much I need it. He FLINGS the owl wing crescent, whizzing into the dark.What?I can't believe it still fits. Luckily I constructed it with material that was elastic and-- Dan turns as Laurie appears at the door, decked in her BLACK SPANDEX. SILK SPECTRE, looking every bit as good as seventeen---form fittingMe too.Let's have some cloud cover.Hang on. Dan BANKS, wheeling the ship toward the VELDT BUILDING.Got to clean her up a bit. I'm sure Adrian wouldn't want to impede the course of justice. Heading straight for the building, Dan JIGS at the last moment, flying the ship THROUGH THE V-SHAPED WATERFALL in the skyscraper's center. The water washes clean the years of dust. The Owl-Ship emerges, sparkling like new.I'm putting the water cannons on the lower stories.Yeah. He puts a hand on her shoulder. His eyes locked onto hers. He knows what he wants and this time he's not afraid of it He kisses her. Hard. Running her hands up his cheeks, they slide each other's masks off. Their mouths melt together.Yeah, saving those people from the fire. Taking Archie out Laurie swats him on the chest--that's not what she meant. Dan grins, having fun with her.It--you were unbelievable. They kiss.I've been thinking about that. And I believe we have certain obligations to our fraternity.Rorschach may be sick, but I think he's on to something--four heroes attacked in a week is not a coincidence. I mean, that whole cancer thing with ion, does that make sense to you? You didn't contract cancer from him. He says as Laurie's about to light a cigarette. She changes her mind.I don't know. But I know someone who might be able to help. Dan lands the Owl-Ship on the roof.You're leaving town? So you do believe Rorschach's theory.All the more reason we need to get to the bottom of this. Maybe we can get Jon to come back in the process and stop all this madness.Rorschach's been the only one investigating this from the start. Without him, we're starting at the beginning and we don't have that kind of time. We need your help, Adrian.Where are you going to go?You don't have to do this. I know the whole crimefighting thing wasn't necessarily your choice in life.Hmm, Rorschach gets locked up in here and suddenly there's a riot. I wonder if that's a coincidence. They descend toward the hell of TEAR-GAS, FIRE and VIOLENCE. The Tower Guards, stunned at the sight of the Owl-Ship, begin SHOOTING at it. The bullets bounce right off.Put your ear-plugs in.When he and I were partners, we each had tracking implants put under our skin so old Archie here could find us if either one of us were ever in trouble. Let's see if Rorschach kept his in. Dan turns on the GPS monitor. There's a BLIP on the screen.He's in that wing. Dan steers the ship toward the Maximum Security Wing. 9He's alive.Rorschach? Rorschach!Hey, it happens. I remember I lost a big arrest like that once. Had to redesign the costume after that-- Rorschach exits the bathroom, wiping his hands.Hey! Survive now! Argue later! I had to turn the screechers off, so we'll be drawing fire. The owl-Ship rises to the roof. They all jump in.Rorschach, you remember how to handle Archie?Give us a second--What? What is it Dan looks up, through the windshield, and sees-- --Dr. Manhattan WALKING ACROSS THE CLOUDS--STRAIGHT FOR THEWait, what? You're taking her to Mars? No, she can't--Laurie, I don't know aboutLet's try and lose them in the city. He hits the jets, heading for the New York SKYLINE.oh no.I know-- They head straight for the subway-- --when the tunnel opens up-- --Dan SWERVES to the adjacent track just in time.Shit. Dan accelerates, weaving Archie around the skyscrapers, the Empire State Building . but the copter's still there. Dan cuts around the UNITED NATIONS BUILDING. The copter follows the Owl-Ship around to the East River . but the Owl-Ship is nowhere to be found The copter hovers there. Baffled.Hey! We took enough unnecessary risks bringing Archie up so you could get your spare costume. We stay put until it cools down out there--they're looking for us.I know, you told me already. I'm tapping into all the databases, finding out about the company--Listen, I HAVE HAD IT! Who the hell do you think you are? You live off people while insulting them, and no one complains because they think you're a goddamn lunatic! Dan turns away, shaking. He leans against the console.I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Maybe you're right, maybe--Hey forget it It's okay, man. Releasing his hand with some effort, Dan sits, invigorated.You're right. It's time to head up.Let's really start plumbing the depths.Positive. Pyramid Industries. Specializes in industrial plastics. At least they did.I tapped into all the databases--tax records, business registries, real estate records--trying to get a bead on who's behind Pyramid but it's a never ending paper trail. Rorschach investigates ahead when Dan catches some MOVEMENT-- --he turns his FLASHLIGHT to find a few HOMELESS PEOPLE squatting in the warehouse. Upon seeing Dan in.costume, the Homeless People run away.They're harmless, Rorschach.Hey, I know this man.No I didn't watch that interview. This was the guy who was doing a story on Adrian when I went to see him.Rorschach. What, what if it's Adrian?On the surface it doesn't, but hear me out--Adrian's the only one who could've taken on the Comedian in hand to hand combat. He's the only one with the finances to create an entire company for the sole purpose of setting up Dr. Manhattan. And Adrian was directly involved in arranging that broadcast. He probably supplied this journalist with the whole cancer list.If we say that Adrian set that up himself, he could've had the hitman shoot his assistant first. It was a risk, but--I don't know. Let's go ask him.Something I can help you with, boys? They all spin around, frightened at the costume.What old guy?You're dead! You and the rest of your gang, you're all DEAD! You know how much fire-power I've got floating out there!? Oh god damn. Hollis. God damn god damn god damn Dan begins to break up. Rorschach quietly pulls him away.I've got a large reading ahead. Anything that's emitting that much heat out here, must be a pretty big facility. Adrian.They're icing up, hold on! Dan pulls the stick back. The ship SHUDDERS UPWARD.We just lost the engines--find something to grab on to! The ship BARELY CLEARS THE CLIFF. BOUNCING hard, it SKIPS across the snow like a stone, finally CRASHING INTO A DRIFT.The engines are de-icing. You sure I can't fit you with something warmer?Adrian, don't make me-- Adrian picks up a GOLDEN SERVING TRAY off the table as Dan FIRES. Adrian DEFLECTS the laser with the tray-- --then DISCUS-SLINGS the tray into Dan's NOSE. Blood SPRAYS, Dan drops to his knees. Adrian turns his back on them, calm.You know! You killed the Comedian! You set up Rorschach! You created Pyramid Industries, hired all those people, gave them cancer and blamed it on Jon!Dammit Adrian, what are you trying to do?Why take that risk? What if the hitman shot you first instead of your assistant?Triumph? Adrian, what are you going to do?Three million people? You're joking.Rorschach, he's making it up!By killing millions of people? And when were you planning on doing this?God. God, heBy committing the biggest mass murder in history. You have no right to play God!Jon, stop him, he killed millions of people, who knows what else he'll do. Jon walks calmly after Adrian.Jon, are you okay? You seem drugged.What? Where's Laurie?Laurie, shoot him again! Adrian's hand falls from his chest to the floor, blood trickling, as his PALM OPENS-- --holding a BULLET inside.LAURIE! If you've hurt her, I'll--He's right. All we did was fail to stop him from saving Earth.Rorschach, wait a second! Let's talk this out!Rorschach! Across the hall, ion materializes between Rorschach and the exit.Your death.Yeah. You might have created peace, but not at the expense of justice. You need to pay for what you've done.Exactly. Adrian readies himself. Laurie breaks away from the TV screens.Tell you the truth, Adrian. I don't. Dan FLIES at Adrian, fighting like a madman for his life. His fighting style has changed. Dan's newfound brutality is informed by everything he's learned from Rorschach. About justice. About life. But Adrian is the best. He takes Dan's attacks apart with ease, delivering blows which would kill a man not quite so focused on his goal. In the end, he CATCHES Dan's final strike and TWISTS. Dan's arm SNAPS easily.Really? I've always liked owls Adrian sees that Dan has pulled one last item from his belt. Adrian STEPS on Dan's WRIST, bones crunching. Dan's HAND falls OPEN, revealing the OWL-SHIP REMOTE.because you can never hear them coming. BEHIND ADRIAN: FLOODLIGHTS BLAZE, targeting Adrian as the OWL- SHIP CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW and into Adrian and Dan. Silence, but for the tinkling of GLASS falling to the floor. Dan tries to stand, but he falls, his left leg shattered. Most of Adrian has been CRUSHED under the ship. He coughs a fine blood spray. Adrian looks over to Dan, dying.So do I. Adrian lays back, calm, accepting and dies.That's it. Careful. Now, pull the stick to the left The ship RISES and TURNS awkwardly in the hall, smashing out more glass.Now, the thrusters . There. She HITS THE THRUSTERS. The ship FLIES from the control room. It's afterburners IGNITING the room, and Adrian's body.Oh hi.There are always bad guys. Even in today's world. Slow, Laurie turns to the window. Looks out at the New York skyline being rebuilt.Hmm?As long as no-one ever finds out that Adrian was behind it all, the public will think ion is still up there, watching.The threat remains, and

watching threat remains fine"}, "DR. MANHATTAN": {"raw_line": "Good evening, Rorschach. --and we see DR. MANHATTAN for the very first time. He is SIXTY FEET TALL, BLUE LIGHT ripples from his skin, emanating pure power--he is God on earth. He works on a reactor--telekinetically moving parts in the air-- not even looking at Rorschach. It's as if Dr. Manhattan already knew he was coming.Yes, since he and I are the only two extranormal operatives currently employed by the government, I was informed. The CIA suspects one of the radical Islamic groups. Dr. Manhattan shrinks from sixty to six feet in size. He speaks in a cold, even, matter of fact manner.A live human body and a dead human body have the same number of particles. Structurally there's no difference.Rorschach, please don't upset Laurie. IExcuse me for a moment. Suddenly he disappears.These men were transporting a shipment of enriched uranium-- With a gesture, the container floats off the truck and separates into pieces . . revealing the URANIUM inside. Suddenly the uranium changes--I've safely transformed the uranium into sand. I trust you can take things from here. And just like that he disappears--Rorschach--you're upsetting Laurie. I think you ought to go.I said you ought to go.He's gone. Are you okay now?I'm having trouble with my vision. I can't see clearly what lies ahead. There's some static interference.I'm uncertain. A power surge of great magnitude? Perhaps a nuclear detonation.There's no such thing as the \"future.\" I've explained to you on many occasions--I understand your frustration, Laurie. The human mind for some reason is only capable of viewing time frame by frame. Perhaps you'd find it more comforting if you could perceive time as I do Dr. Manhattan touches her head--I didn't mean to upset you.You go ahead, Laurie. I want to further investigate this interference with my vision. I find it troubling.You sound bitter.Blake . don't. BLAM! Blake shoots her; the Girl SLAMS against the far wall. She drops, dead.Blake. She was pregnant. You gunned her down. Blake turns on him, spitting fury.Don't worry, we have plenty of time.Is this dark enough?Thank you.It was my duty. CUT TO: Dan and Laurie surrounded by the Thugs . when suddenly they DIVE INTO the group, fighting like the heroes they once were. Dan grapples with one of the Thugs and knocks his knife away-- --when another Thug nails him from behind with a BAT. Dan drops to the ground . BACK TO:Yes, he was a good friend of mine. When we were both physicists.I remember. I attended his funeral.I was not aware--By your line of questioning, you're suggesting that I was the cause of cancer in these individuals.It is irrelevant whether I was the cause or not.A live human body and a dead human body have the same number of particles. Structurally there's no difference. An appalled then angry buzz comes over the audience.Janey Slater? Wh--No, Janey, wait! In the audience, Adrian turns to the Press Agent, frantic.No. Please let me throughPlease. If everyone would just go away and leave me alone. Adrian hears the note of warning in his voice.I said LEAVE ME ALONE! Every last person BURSTS INTO PARTICLES and DISAPPEARS. Dr. Manhattan is suddenly alone. He looks stunned almost.Hello Laurie.I am on Mars. You and I are about to have a conversation there.You are going to try to convince me to save the world.So. What do you think?Oh. Forgive me. These things sometimes slip my mind. He TOUCHES her mouth, forming a small ATMOSPHERE around her. She HEAVES in air, retching and choking at the same time.Our conversation commences when you surprise me with the information that you and Dreiberg have been sleeping together.Not yet. But in a few moments, you're going to tell me.Why does my perception of time distress you so?Because everything is pre-ordained. Even my responses.You mean you're sleeping with Dan Dreiberg? Contemplating this, he steps to the balcony's edge.I said, often, that you were my only remaining link with the world. Now that link is shattered. Don't you see the futility of asking me to save a world that I no longer have any stake in?Not to me. My red world here means more to me than your blue one. I'll show you around if you like. The giant Glass Palace begins to RUMBLE.Nor I. Believe me, I fully understand the gravity of the situation. The clockwork Glass Palace RISES HIGH INTO THE AIRIt ends with you in tears.I return to Earth at some point. The streets are filled with death.I can't be sure. I'm still experiencing some static interference preventing any clear vision of what lies ahead.Tachyon particles. Tachyons are a rare occurrence. The detonation of nuclear warheads could conceivably be the cause.And the universe will not even notice. See the dual moons. Aren't they breathtaking? Above, TWO MOONS cross overhead. One is HUGE, CRIMSON RED, the smaller is a delicate SHELL PINK. Spectacular.No, thermodynamic miracles are--On the Argyre Planitia? As you wish. The structure descends. Laurie stomps down the stairs.Laurie. You complain that I refuse to see life on life's terms. And yet you continuously refuse to see things from my perspective. If only you'd try to see the whole continuum, life's pattern, you'd understand. But you deliberately shut it out as if afraid to see.The comedian was your father.Attacked your mother. Yes. Two years later he came back to her, to make amends. And you were conceived on that day.I don't think your life is a joke.But I've changed my mind. There are miracles in your world that are worth preserving.I tried to explain. Thermodynamic miracles--events with odds against so astronomical, like oxygen turning into gold. I have longed to witness such a thing and yet I neglect that in human coupling, millions upon millions of cells compete to create life over generation after generation: Until finally, your mother loves a man--Edward Blake, the Comedian--a man she has every reason to hate. And out of that contradiction, against unfathomable odds, it was you, only you, that emerged. To distill so specific a form from all of that chaos; Your creation is like . turning air into gold. A miracle.Yes, anyone in the world. But the world is so crowded with miracles that they become commonplace and we forget. I forget. They stand there in silence. Connected for the first time in years.Now. Dry your eyes. FROM ABOVE: We see the full CRATER--the ARGYRE PLANITIA. Round, with two, eye-like BOULDERS set side by side, a RIDGE of land curling below . like a smiley-face.And let's go home.Interference. Cataclysmic interference. Laurie looks up and screams. THOUSANDS OF BLACK SILHOUETTES are IMPRINTED on the STREET and the WALLS. Everywhere. There is no rubble--some buildings have simply disintegrated.Not a war. I .don't know what it was. Dr. Manhattan looks up into the sky, studying it.I'm sorry. This must be very upsetting for you. I have traced the source of the Tachyon particles to Antarctica. Shall we?Adrian, of course. Who else would have the resourcesYes. Yes, he killed Blake and millions of others. Excuse me, Daniel, I'm talking to Laurie ninety seconds agoI'm sorry. It's these tachyons. They're, muddling things up. I'd better follow himYes. Yes, he killed Blake and millions of others. Excuse me, Daniel, I'm talking to Laurie ninety seconds agoI'm sorry. It's these tachyons. They're, muddling things up. I'd better follow himAdrian, don't be foolish. Even if I can't predict where I'm going to find you, I can turn the walls to glass. The tachyons were clever but it's time to give up Jon spots the Lynx in a METAL CORRIDOR.Very well. If I must, let us follow this through to the bitter end. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALLS is Adrian, waiting by a CONTROL PANEL. He takes one last look at his Lynx.Adrian? Adrian, don't-- LIGHT BLASTS through Jon and the Lynx--both are OBLITERATED. Adrian peers around the corner, winded by his success.Restructuring myself was the first trick I learned! It didn't kill me before, did you seriously think it would kill me now? You are nothing but a man. And the world's smartest man means no more to me than its smartest termite! Out of tricks, out of traps, Adrian lifts the remote.What is that, Adrian? Some new, ultimate weapon?I'm afraid he's correct. Exposing Adrian would only doom the world to nuclear destruction again.Where are you going, Rorschach?Rorschach, you know I can't let you do that. Rorschach pauses. Dan is halfway there . Rorschach removes his mask, tears stand in his eyes.Laurie. I'm leaving this galaxy. For one a little less complicated.I have. I think maybe I'll create some. Goodbye, Laurie. He kisses her on the cheek--Without condoning or condemning, I", "clean_line": "good evening rorschach dr manhattan time feet tall blue light ripples skin emanating pure power god earth works reactor

You're a wanted man.Don't call me that. My mother made me take that name. I always hated it.Well, I might not be able to count molecules, but either way, Blake was a bastard. You know he tried to rape my mother?What? Are you accusing--You call rape a moral discrepancy?!Interference? Caused by what?More war talk. I can't deal with this. I don't want to think about the future right now.--that time is simultaneous. There's no past to travel back to, no future to travel forward to, everything happens all at once, our actions affect the course of time instantly, yes I know.Jon, stop!I know. I think I've been cooped up on this base for too long. Rorschach mentioned Dan Dreiberg--we haven't seen him in years. Maybe we can give him a call, see if he's available for dinner tonight.Out.No, thank you. I called a cab already-- it's waiting for me outside. She tries to walk past but Agent Forbes steps in front of her.An old friend of mine. And of Dr. Manhattan's. Now step out of my way.Yes, sir. She brushes past him as she leaves.You remember that crazy guy, what did he call himself . Captain Carnage! Pretended to be a supervillian just so he could get beat up all the time?Sorry, sorry, that's not funny. I can't remember the last time I laughed like this. It feels good. Dan looks at her as she finishes her coffee. We can see he's smitten with her and that he probably has been for years. Laurie seems oblivious.Yeah, this was fun. The WAITER arrives with the check; Laurie grabs it.Let me put my expense account to use. You can thank Uncle Sam.Just making sure I'm not doing anything that might upset the country's most powerful weapon.I really don't know. It's been harder and harder to tell over the years. It's like his emotions are slowly eroding. To be honest, I can't tell if he even cares about me anymore. They're quiet a moment. Laurie glances at her watch.I should get back.Y1 know, when I think back, why did we do it? Why did we dress up like that? I think the Keene Act was the best thing to ever happen to us.I mean, you remember my costume? All that tight spandex? That was awful.And to think my own mother pushed me into that spandex. Pushed me into the whole costume thing in the first place. Wanted her little girl to be just like mommy and fight bad guys.We'll do this again.Well, I'm not. I hate it when Jon teleports me.No. Sally pours herself a margarita from a pitcher on the counter. We see photos, remnants of Sally from her crimefighting days around the condo. Under the pitcher of margaritas is a days old LA Times with the headline: \"Dr. Manhattan Intercepts Terrorists At Port.\"Poor Eddie? How can you say that? After what he--Another lesson on time passing. Y'know, you and Jon should get together and write a book on the subject. Sally reaches into a drawer and pulls out the old photo of the Watchmen, the same one with Blake and Hollis Mason in it.Mmm. What time do you have to be at your TV interview?Hey, your finger, it's like licking a battery. It's all-- She opens her eyes. They widen in shock and horror as she sees TWO DR. MANHATTANS in bed with her.Oh God! That's horrible! Stop it! Laurie jumps up. The two Dr. Manhattans stand, confused.I'm sorry, I--You startled me, that's allForget about it. I overreacted. It was just strange to see-- Laurie can now see into the KITCHEN, where yet a THIRD DR. MANHATTAN is working on an experiment. Her eyes blaze.How long have you been working in here?Understand!? You're working in here at the same time we're in bed!?Shut up! Just SHUT YOUR MOUTH! Laurie WHIPS a full BEAKER at 3's chest. It PASSES THROUGH HIM and SMASHES IN THE KITCHEN SINK. Laurie storms out.Human emotion? You were human once. That's the problem, Jon. You've forgotten that.It's Laurie.I left Jon.I lost them in the subways. I think.Living with him . Dan, you don't know what it's been like. INTERCUT TO: Dr. Manhattan, holding Laurie's BRA. Staring.The way he looks at things, like he can't remember what they are, like he doesn't really care. This world, the real world to him it's like walking through mist, and all the people are just shadows. Shadows in the fog. Dr. Manhattan lowers his head. A SHADOW FALLS OVER HIM. He looks up to see a THREE PIECE SUIT floating before him-- waiting for its wearer.I hope I didn't ruin your night.I know. I just find it rude when people show up at your door----completely out of the blue. Suddenly, Dr. Manhattan appears in a burst of energy. The receptionist SHRIEKS. The PRODUCER looks out his office.I should find a hotel. God. Imagine, us getting mugged.No thanks, I've had enough hero stuff for one night. You take care, Dan. It's a dangerous world out there.You're the Comedian, right? You were pretty cool in there. Blake lights a smoke, looks her over.Got another smoke?No. Not really. As Blake gives her a light, Laurie touches his hand to cover the lighter from the wind. She looks up at him, sly.I don't understand, what do you mean, Jon's gone?No.Jon? Jon, can you hear me? The GRAPH-NEEDLES jump and tick, searching . when a high, clear TONE rings through the room. Needles fly. Technicians dash to lock it down. Agent Forbes hurries to the graph, looking over their shoulders.Jon. Can you hear me, Jon? But these VOICES get progressively QUIETER, as we-- ZOOM BACK: Up, out of the atmosphere, at a blinding rate--Agent Forbes.I need to go to the bathroom. Agent Forbes gives her a look, then waves for a SECRET SERVICE AGENT to escort her.You're getting me out of here.Don't you understand that sitting there with a bunch of high tech radios and monitors isn't going to bring him back?Only one thing can bring ion back and that's Jon. If he wants to find me, he's quite capable of doing so on his own. I've been a prisoner in my live long enough. You are taking me out of here because if you don't, and Jon does come back, I'm going to let him know who was naughty and who was nice. And he won't give you a lump of coal--he'll turn you into one, understand? The Agent eyes her, then reluctantly gets to his feet.Oh my god. Where's Adrian now?I'm not sure. I can't go stay with my mom- -I'm sure that's the first place they'll look. But I need to get out of the city. It's only a matter of time before they find me.Oh, Dan, I couldn't impose--You're buying into Rorschach's \"mask killer\" theory?Okay.What time is it?That mask's eaten Rorschach's brains away.He shot a cop with a grappling gun.And this war, god. Sometimes I wish I could just leave the planet. Like Jon.Now, that's funny. That's what you call Jon's teleportation?All these gadgets and there isn't even a dash lighter She hits a BUTTON--the lights inside go DIM. Creepy. She hits the button again to turn the lights back on but nothingI'm so sorry--I hit the wrong button. I was looking for the lighter in.there.I'm fine, but your ship--Archie?Still with the mask-killer theory? Rorschach is insane.How did you ever afford all this?How did he die?You really do worry about me, don't you?What's wrong? But Dan is already walking up the stairs, pathetic. Laurie's left there, alone. The Owl-Costume looming in the background.Dan? Is everything okay? I heard you coming down the stairs Descending the stairs, she finds Dan before his costume, naked. He fiddles with an OWL-WING THROWING WEAPON.So. Let's take the ship out.Who's to know? I used to be a \"masked avenger\" too, remember? I'm used to getting up at three in the morning to do something stupid. Besides, I'm already a wanted lady, you're already in trouble for hiding me, how much more trouble can we be in? Just give me a second--can't go out like this. She jogs upstairs. Dan turns to the empty, waiting suit.I'm ready. Dan turns and sees his reflection in the owl-Ship's window.It's so beautifulLook! Below, a TENEMENT BUILDING is ENGULFED IN FLAME. Dan's jaw sets. He wheels the ship around and down. As they zoom closer, they can see people SCREAMING from the windows.There's children in there!I'm on it. Nite Owl.Hi. If you could all form a line, we'll have you out of here in just a moment. ATOP THE SHIP: Dan latches the steering column into its roof socket. He stands; Takes a deep, chest-expanding breath. Who has he been kidding? This is who he is. Flicking a switch OLD JAZZ plays pleasantly.Anybody want coffee?I can't believe we did that! That was actually funIt was good, wasn't it?So . what do we do next? Dan sits up, serious. Very serious.What?Look, Dan, I'm glad you were able to rediscover your calling in life, but I think you're getting carried away. You're talking about springing a homicidal psychopath from prison.Why would someone want to drive ion away? Look what's happening now. With Jon gone it looks like we're headed for another World War. Who would want that?It's happening Dan breaks away from the terrible news, follows Adrian.No. But this is. She moves next to him.But I'm not doing it for Rorschach or even for Jon. And I'm sure as hell not doing if for the Comedian. They look at each other--Dan knows who she's doing it for. The Owl-Ship is upon the prison nowLook! They see a RIOT below--Inmates spilling out into the yard, overwhelming the Correctional Officers on the ground; TOWER GUARDS take shots at some of the Inmates; Broken glass, broken furniture parts scattered through the yard; SMOKE emits from inside the prison.How are we going to find Rorschach in all of this?How do we know he's still alive? They come upon Rorschach's cell. Dan sees the SMOKING CORPSE of Dumb Thug. Sees the CUT OFF HANDS of Fat Thug, HANGING from the bars.Is that--Oh, for Christ's sake.Are you sure you're ready? We don't want to go diving head-first into things.I'm not.What's that supposed to mean? We came here to rescue you, asshole!It `s him. The ship COLLIDES with Dr. Manhattan, who PASSES THROUGH into the CABIN with a SHOWER of BLUE PARTICLES--They said you were on Mars.Where? What are you talking about?I have to go, Dan. Jon and I, we're going to talk. Maybe we'll find some way out of this mess the world's gotten itself in. I'll be okay. Really.J--huc? Hhhhhhh-- Laurie GRIPS her throat and TUMBLES down the hill. She rolls into Jon, waiting for her at the bottom. She CLAWS at him.Jon, you stupid bastard! Listen, you better not forget this air supply or whatever it is Oh shit. Laurie stands up before Jon's huge GLASS PALACE.I'm on Mars.You . know about me and Dan?Jon, I'm having enough problems right now without getting into your predestination crap.Because. If you already know the future, why were you surprised when I left you, or when that reporter ambushed you? Why even debate if you already know the outcome?Agh! This is so typical of you! Do you know what a relief it is to be with somebody human, like Dan?But you already know . You said--That's ridiculous. The Earth is too important to hinge on one relationship.Are you doing this? I'm not in the mood for jokes.Can't you just tell me how this all ends and save us the trouble?Tears. You mean I lose? You don't come back to Earth?You mean there's going to be a war? An actual, nuclear war?Static?Jon, you've got to stop it! Everyone will die!You're right, Jon--what does human life matter next to a, a neutrino. Look, I'm not going to debate you when you clearly don't see anything terribly miraculous about life. I guess quantum physics doesn't allow for miracles.Oh God, Jon. Land this thing. Now.That's it then. You can send me back to Earth to fry with Dan and my Mom and all the other worthless humans. And look, you were wrong. You said this ended with me in tears and see? Not a damp eye in the house. Maybe you're wrong about everything.I'm not afraid, okay? You want me to see things your way? Go ahead, do that thing you do. She stands there, arms folded, waiting. Then, just like earlier in the lab, Jon touches her head--Mommy?No. No, no, no, no not himBut he--The comedian is my father. I guess my life is just one big joke.Well, of course you're going to say that.What? But you were saying--But if my birth is a miracle you, you could say that about anyone.God Jon, what was that? Jon looks around the street. Even he is awe-struck.Was it a war? It doesn't seem like--Take me out of here, Jon. Please.Anywhere. Anywhere's better than here.Wait, this is Adrian's compound? Are you saying he's responsible for this-- Jon walks toward the building, entranced. Distracted.What, Daniel? Millions of others? Jon don't start that crap now, not here!You're such an asshole. Adrian cries out, LEAPS at her as she FIRES-- --and hits Adrian. He COLLAPSES. Dan and Rorschach find them as Laurie approaches Adrian's bodyOh shit. Adrian opens his eyes and KICKS her in the stomach, sending her flying back.Next? You can't get away with this!We we can't say anything about thisLeaving? I, I thought you regained an interest in human life.Dan! Laurie charges Adrian. With one hand, Adrian blocks her attack, grabs her by the hair and SLAMS her to floor, knocking her out.I'm okay. Thanks. We finally see Laurie now--her hair dyed, appearance changed.Mom--I just want to get this out of the way . . I know Eddie Blake, the Comedian--I know he was my father. Sally freezes.I remember. Sally downs her drink, immediately starts making another.Mom. People's lives take them strange places. You never did anything wrong by me. Sally jumps as a CLICK/WHIR SOUND comes from a BOOKCASE.Oh that's Dan. Home from \"work.\" The bookcase SLIDES ASIDE and a blond DAN enters from the secret ELEVATOR. He is trim and confident, cheeks flushed with color. Buttoning up his shirt, he spots Sally.Any bad guys last night?Dan.Will it be alright? The world, I mean. He puts his arm around her shoulder.Yeah.
