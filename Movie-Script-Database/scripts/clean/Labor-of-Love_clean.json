Are you going to show it to someone?Then why?Exactly. No reason. No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how... How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?You missed mommie... worried when I didn't come down... my baby... so sweet.That one.Onions?Love... has something to do with it.Show me.You like to take walks?You just said something very sweet.It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.I was just thinking that if we actually became a couple -- this was a beautiful place to begin things.I've changed my mind.I want children.Yes.Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.You can change.Don't be so sure.What if something happens to one of us? We'll be all alone.I love you Maurice Parker.It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.It'll make it.You must miss flying. Being way up there in the clouds looking down at all of us. You miss that don't you? You miss playing with your friends and talking with them...Maurice! Maurice! Come out here.All he needed was love. Once you have that, you can do anything.What's wrong? They said something was wrong?Everyone's here. Everything looks beautiful. They even got the white dove I wanted for the cake -- so what's wrong? What is it?Your father?That's okay -- really it is.The day I met you, I gave you my heart. Today, I give you my soul. Where ever you are, where ever you go, I will be with you.

I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact...I would be exceedingly boring.I don't do these type of things.See there are two kinds of people in this world. ... Just a short one okay?There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.Who's telling this story?Good, now the team had this great big player -- Big Billy. He was the best. He had them in the World Super-Bowl-Championship of little kids baseball. But right before the game, the second best player on the team was suspended because he played a prank on a nice man who owned a book store... When that boy grew up he was convicted on burglary charges and spent fifteen years in prison -- where he belongs.Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands. 'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.Right. But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy. He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game. It came to the end of the game. It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...Okay nine. Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base. That's when Isaac came up. He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium. Everyone cheered. Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play. Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together. The end.There was a boy named Isaac who liked to play baseball...It's yours.This isn't right.This is a loan.I have to go now.Why didn't I meet you fifteen years ago?I'm fine.It's him.He's plastered.No it's not. He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker. He's never been there for me. I've always been alone.I'm afraid Ellen... I'm scared of being alone again. What if one day you realize how boring I am? What if one day you realize you're not happy? I could have been alone before, but now you've changed things. I can't be alone anymore Ellen. I'm scared what's going to happen to me.It's over Ellen... I failed you again.I tried Ellen, I really tried... I don't have the strength.You said I would never be alone!... You promised... ... You promised.I'm fine.No thank you.No.Where am I?Which hospital? Did you take me back?Thank God.I can't believe you're here. I'm touched.Are you two planning kids?You should definitely have children. They're really special.How serious is it?Can it kill me?I suppose I over did it.What steps do we take now?What are the odds? Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?Then it'll have to wait until I finish.I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want.I'm completing the walk. I'm almost there.Hello.Confused. I'm not sure what to do now. I'm not sure what he wants for me.What do you mean?What? Who are you?What the hell is this?My wife is dead....

I thought you understood what I was doing.Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?... To look me in the eye and say what's important to you isn't as important to me? To tell me you know what's best? To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife?It's mine to risk.No more words. Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.What do your friends call you?Do you have a car, Steph?I need your help.You ever lose somebody Stephanie?Did you tell him everything you wanted to? Did you do everything you could while he was here?If I don't do this Steph, my life isn't worth saving.Please, help me.This is it...

My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.

I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the \"Journal of Educational Psychology\", \"American Journal of Psychology\", \"Psychology Review\" and \"Science\"...

This is not James Bond here, this is my uncle who owns a bookstore, and gets outwitted by grade school kids pulling pranks!Let me tell you a story Sergeant. There was a patient of mine who had a Golden Retriever, Mac... She loved Mac, not like a pet, but like a family member. One day, she had to leave Mac with 'friends', and wouldn't you know it, Mac gets away and ends up falling into a sewer. My patient comes back -- goes nuts when she hears that Mac has been in the sewer for over 48 hours. Apparently the cop who found the dog didn't want to get his pants dirty. And neither did anyone else. So of course, my patient decides to go in after it... she falls... breaks her hip and lands next to her dead dog, who died of toxic fumes down there...The moral of the story is... She sued for a lot of money! She sued the friends, the city, and the officer for negligence on duty. She has no Mac, no happiness, but she's very rich now... That was a dog. We're talking about a human being... I hope everyone clearly understands the chain of events that will occur if something should happen to my uncle, whom I love more than you can possibly imagine...
