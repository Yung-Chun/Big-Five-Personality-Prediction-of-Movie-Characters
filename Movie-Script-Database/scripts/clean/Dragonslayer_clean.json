{"Dragonslayer": {"GALEN": {"raw_line": "Vide, Magister. There's something wrong.What's the matter? What's happened?To me?Of course.Well, almost.The first two chapters.To tell the truth, I haven't dared try it. What's the point, anyway?I hate books. I hate drill. I want a real task.I don't hear anything.Voices, singing on the road.I don't see anything.Here are your sticks.You're in a morbid frame of mind. What's all this about dying? You don't even look sick.Master, don't you think --Look at yourself. How far will you get like that? A league, two leagues?Why don't you wave your hands around and summon up a coach-and-four?You pilgrims: You're used to lotteries. Why not draw straws to see who'll be first to carry ironshanks here.Send me. You're always saying I need seasoning. I need a test. Let me go.I'm ready for anything.Not this one, was it?Hodge -- what are you doing?Stand back!Cragganmore! Domus non i am! Silva celet!I guess...Me too...What's the matter, Hodge, pack too heavy? Here.Too cold, is it?Too warm?I've got as much respect for the master as anyone, old man. But -- then again, I'm master now.Easy now. We mean no harm. We've been looking for you.More the other way around, I'd say.A few words, that's all. You were looking for a conjurer.Right. Requiscat in pace. Ecce: magister novus!My lord Ulrich is no longer. All that you asked of him, you may now expect of me. The dangers he would face, I will now conquer. The task he would undertake I will now fulfill. I am Galen Bradwardyn, inheritor of Ulrich's craft and knowledge, and I am the Sorcerer you seek.What's the matter with him?What have you got there?A little gold, eh? What do you say I change it into lead?I'm no fraud.Hodge, nobody forced you to come along.Well, if he told you I needed wetnursing, why don't you just turn yourself around and go back home.You're too far behind us. Come on out.Not a good idea to get separated. Let's go.By the gods!I'm not going to say anything.Take it easy. I knew the moment I saw you. I've known the whole time.Don't worry. No one's going to find out. Just tell me: why?The lottery! Daughters are chosen, but sons are not!What do you mean?No!No!Hodge!I hear you.I know.What are you doing with this, Hodge?Hodge, don't die. Listen to me. You're not going to die.Excede, mortem! Revoca, vitam! Excede, mortem! Revoca, vitam!The whole kingdom like this?Where?I see it. Let's have a look.Are there other entrances?No smoke. How do you know it's in there?Now, great mountain, hear my command: Terrae lapsus consignet latibulum draconis! Evanescat latibulum draconis!You're talking about superstition, friend. None of that has anything to do with what I, Galen, have already achieved.People of Urland! Send a messenger to the king. Vermithrax is dead. Crushed by the power of the moon and the stars! Laid low by ancient wisdom. Dropped into the Abyss by mystical practice.Nihil plus mysterium!Looks like you've been up to a little sorcery yourself.Or is it witchcraft?What's the matter? A real woman never stops talking.What sort of gratitude? A knife in the belly? An arrow in the back?Don't worry. I'll be back.One of the best things about the water here in Urland is that there's so much of it -- look at that!Mmm. Good. But not cold enough. Perhaps I could borrow a scarf from his Majesty.I cover the goblet, so... remove, so... and behold: winter in a mug!All right. How many of you have ever seen a table fly?Wait, it'll rise now.Yes.Please -- no payment. I have always found magical practice to be its own reward. I seek only some yet greater challenge.I was invited.What failure? What's the matter with you people? You want the dragon back?Yes, of course. Dead.Cubiculum gravis aperat!Open up, dammit! Fenestra gravis aperat! Asser gravis aperat! Divinitus!How do you do.I see.And only a few had to be sacrificed.Depends on who does the dying.Virgin?If you say so.Nothing.Maybe.I'm sorry. I heard a rumor. Families with money, that sort of thing.Wait -- how long do I have to stay in here?Greil -- help!It's me. Are you hurt?I can't.I can't do it.I just can't.I'm no sorcerer. Whatever power I might have had, it's gone.I know: I'm an imposter. A fraud. A fake. I'm sorry...Smith -- have you ever forged a weapon?These are your sharpest?It's sharp -- but it's not sharp enough.For what I'm going to do with it.Valerian, this isn't just for your sake.I'll need the amulet.I know. We've met.I'm unarmed. If you want a fight, at least give me a weapon.Don't bother. That's not the kind of fire we need.Nunc, per Potestatem Hermeticum -- ex flammis, ferrum sangrinarium!Well done, Simon. Thank you.I understand.Thank you.Hatchlings. They'll have to be killed too. Anything else?Yes.Who is? What do you mean?And you'll be eligible because --I am in love. But not with the Princess.Be gone!I've got plenty of reasons to kill you that have nothing to do with this sacrifice.Run! Get out of here!No! Stop! What are you doing?Elspeth!Still alive.Nothing. I was just thinking -- poor Hodge.Hurts. That thing was small, but its teeth were sharp.But the big one's alive. Somewhere down in that burning lake.You old trickster! The burning water! The lake of fire!He had it planned. He knew this was going to happen.We've got to go back, I want to talk to him!He couldn't walk -- he knew he couldn't make the journey. So he had us make the journey for him! Don't you see?What? Why? No you're not, this is my job. Absolutely not.Stay close.Never mind. Come on.All right. Wait here.Ex favilla, vita nova!Ulrich! Magister! Over here! I can see you! Over here!Wonder of wonders -- you're back! I thank the powers that made me!Food?Wait, I have something to tell you.No it can't. Listen: I thought I was a sorcerer -- but I wasn't. I thought I had power -- but I didn't. I thought I was you -- but I'm not.Anything!No!I can't.Not if it means killing him.No! You can't!No. I'm fine.Yes.That too.Yes?A horse.No. It must have been wandering loose. Or wild.You don't want to wish it gone, do you?", "clean_line": "vide magister wrong matter happened course chapters tell truth haven dared try point hate books hate drill want real task hear voices singing road sticks morbid frame mind dying look sick master think look far like league leagues wave hands summon coach pilgrims lotteries draw straws ll carry ironshanks send saying need seasoning need test let ready hodge stand cragganmore domus non silva celet guess matter hodge pack heavy cold warm ve got respect master old man master easy mean harm ve looking way words looking conjurer right requiscat pace ecce magister novus lord ulrich longer asked expect dangers face conquer task undertake fulfill galen bradwardyn inheritor ulrich craft knowledge sorcerer seek matter got little gold eh change lead fraud hodge forced come told needed wetnursing turn home far come good idea separated let gods going easy knew moment saw ve known time worry going tell lottery daughters chosen sons mean hodge hear know hodge hodge die listen going die excede mortem revoca vitam excede mortem revoca vitam kingdom like let look entrances smoke know great mountain hear command terrae lapsus consignet latibulum draconis evanescat latibulum draconis talking superstition friend galen achieved people urland send messenger king vermithrax dead crushed power moon stars laid low ancient wisdom dropped abyss mystical practice nihil plus mysterium looks like ve little sorcery witchcraft matter real woman stops talking sort gratitude knife belly arrow worry ll best things water urland look mmm good cold borrow scarf majesty cover goblet remove behold winter mug right seen table fly wait ll rise yes payment magical practice reward seek greater challenge invited failure matter people want dragon yes course dead cubiculum gravis aperat open dammit fenestra gravis aperat asser gravis aperat divinitus sacrificed depends dying virgin maybe sorry heard rumor families money sort thing wait long stay greil help hurt sorcerer power gone know imposter fraud fake sorry smith forged weapon sharpest sharp sharp going valerian isn sake ll need amulet know ve met unarmed want fight weapon bother kind need nunc potestatem hermeticum ex flammis ferrum sangrinarium simon thank understand thank hatchlings ll killed yes mean ll eligible love princess gone ve got plenty reasons kill sacrifice run stop elspeth alive thinking poor hodge hurts thing small teeth sharp big alive burning lake old trickster burning water lake planned knew going happen ve got want talk couldn walk knew couldn journey journey job absolutely stay close mind come right wait ex favilla vita nova ulrich magister wonder wonders thank powers food wait tell listen thought sorcerer wasn thought power thought means killing fine yes yes horse wandering loose wild want wish gone"}, "VALERIAN": {"raw_line": "That would be me. We are here on behalf...A bone. Scorched. A rock, fire- blackened. Scales.I found them. At the mouth of the lair.A claw.Who else can we turn to? We all know what we're dealing with here. This is a basilicok. A cockatrice. A dragon. This is no stag, no bear, no natural creature. This is one of your kind. And only a necromancer such as yourself can rid us of it.They're all dead. You're the only one left.Every quarter, upon the solstices and the equinoxes there's a new victim.Girls. Virgins, to be exact, chosen by lot.Are you afraid of dragons?Tyrian!?We're not afraid of you. Give us the road.We've got no doubts. We require no test.He's right. I brought us here for nothing. May the gods help whoever's daughter it is tonight.What do you want?He's dead.We've seen enough tests.What's come over you, anyway? Have you lost your wits?You must be hungry.It's not just him. It's all of us. It's the equinox.You go ahead, I'll catch up.Right. I'll be along.That's all right. Don't come in.You better get back to the group, they're probably worried.I prefer to swim alone, if you don't mind.Stay away.I suppose you'll tell everyone. Go ahead, I don't care. It's a relief.I don't blame you. I was stupid. Careless. A silly woman!You never knew a thing. No one knew. Not since I was born. Go on, run off and tell them. It'll make a great story.Ask my father.That's right. Unless you have plenty of gold or property.If you're rich enough, your name never goes in. My father is poor. So are a lot of fathers.Come on. Don't dawdle here.No. We're near the lair. Keep moving.Over there. Doesn't matter. We're in no danger if we just pass through quickly.No!Greil! Malkin! Help!No. One's enough.Go ahead! You're going to die! What a fine trick that will be!Father? Hello?Father, what are you doing? Have you all lost your minds?And they listen?This is the granary. What kind of welcome is this? I've got news of the sorcerer and news of the dragon.Ulrich's apprentice. He's a braggart, but it doesn't matter.Your god had nothing to do with it.I'm going to be seen. I want to be seen. Tonight the world finds out that you never had a son.Father: the danger is over.You'll say you did what you had to. This is a time for celebration -- and forgiveness.I think it was much easier being a boy.Don't go, Galen. Cast a spell and turn them into toads. It should be easy; that's what they are.Where have you been? Doesn't matter -- listen: Quick! Make it rain. That'll put the fire out.Then get the animals back. They're all running loose. There's people been hurt. Stop their pain. You can cure them. And we'll need food...What? Why not?But you're a sorcerer.It can't be!You're sorry?! Listen to that! The damn thing is loose, we're all on fire and you're sorry!You didn't have the faintest idea what you were doing, did you? You're a fool -- and I'm a bigger one for bringing you here.I don't want you in this house. Get out.Not here. I can't help you.You too?Not sharp enough for what?Nothing's that sharp.It's beautiful.I'm thankful for that. No man should choose a senseless death.If it's me you're worried about, don't. So my name has been entered, what of it? There are hundreds of girls. My name just won't be drawn. I know it won't.I don't care. It doesn't matter. What you want to kill isn't flesh and blood.How do you know? No one's so much as even scratched it.Look at her. The Princess.There's no mistake! The name's been chosen -- let it stand!No! What better name than your own kin? At last we see justice done!Galen.Here.It's a shield. I made it. Might keep the fire off you. Might not. You know, you're an idiot. You're going to die tonight. You'll be ripped limb from limb. This is the last time I'll ever speak to you.Another thing. That thing isn't alone up there. There's little ones. Young, I think. I don't know how many.You're in love, aren't you?That's all right. I understand. She's very beautiful, very brave.Your Princess. But I don't care. It doesn't change the way I feel. Listen to me, Galen Bradwardyn, sorcerer's apprentice; you're going to be dead, the dragon will be worse than ever, there will be more lotteries, and I'm not a boy any more.Because I'm still a virgin, and I want you to do something about it.You know what we have to do. We have to leave Urland.Not because of what happened. I brought you here -- it didn't work -- now I'm taking you away. Do you understand? You said you loved me. Is it true? If it is, it's the only good we've done. Let's not lose that too. Galen?What's that?How's your leg?At least you killed it. You got all the young.Don't think about it. You had your fight, and you're still here. That's more than anyone else can say. Let's think about what lies ahead.What are you doing?Galen, what are you saying?Who did? What happened?Where are you going?Galen, stop! Please, I beg you!Stop! I won't let you kill yourself.No!All right, all right. You're going in there, I'm going too.I'm not afraid. And you're not going to stop me. After all -- I've been a man longer than you have.What's that?Galen? Galen? Where are you?Galen!Here. Do as he said. Smash it.You heard what he said.You want to rest?You miss Ulricn.And the amulet.Not me. I'm glad it's gone. I'm glad you did what you did. You may not be a sorcerer, Galen, but I love you anyway. I don't regret anything that happened. I just wish ---- that we had a horse.What is this?Did you...!?Wait a minute.
