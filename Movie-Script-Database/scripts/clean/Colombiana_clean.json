A super agent.I want to be a killer.Can you help?Are you trying to scare me?I've already been to school. I told you what I want to be. You don't want to help me, fine. I'll do it myself.But I still want to be a killer.Is that it?Wearing no panties?Thank goodness.Unbutton your shirt.Now.Not room service.I shouldn't drink.I'm so so sorry.What's going on out there?Really?I probably deserve it.I would have never forgiven myself.We're good.Day after.The morning after OK?Say hello to Mama.Hello Danny.Why?I have a key.I've got nowhere to go.Just what?And then we have the most incredible sex. Ever.Uh-uh. This taste good enough.No. They put me to sleep.Would you like the key back?Closer?Is this close enough?On my end. You?What do we have?Not long.No reason.I've got to get ready.Tio. You're removed. You book the work, you collect the fees...I come to you at nine. I say I want to be a killer. What kind of kid makes a career choice like that unless they have something on their mind. I live for the day that the blood of the son of bitch who did my parents drips in the gutter. Stop playing the innocent with me. You know this. Forever.Why?If you do, you would never have let me get involved in the first place.I love you too.Hi guys.Hey! Hey!OK. OK.

You can swim with them all day and they will just ignore you, but put one drop of blood in the water and they become your biggest admirers.I'm not going to kill you. They are.I brought you something.You're making fun.Well, there's that too.You don't want me?What would you like to talk about?You really want to do this?OK.Nothing much.On vacation.Down south.There was that one.It was OK.Nothing much.

Hands up.Turn around.Sit.You mean these?Talking about covering all your bases. Your chair is pressure wired. You move your ass one inch you don't have one anymore.I know what you're thinking. Maybe yes a bluff, maybe no. But you have to figure yes, given what you know about me.This wasn't what I had in mind for myself when I was a kid. I wanted to be on the other side of things. Like you.He did.This is the last time I was happy.The next day they were dead. He killed them.I didn't know how else to find him.It took you a long time.What else do I have to be? I have no one. I did. Until this morning. I had them.And now I want to finish it.Yes you can. He's protected by your government.You're going to have to try harder.I found this on your table inside. Your family, right?Brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews. Mother, father. Nice.I know this sounds harsh. But until I get what I want, you'll go to a funeral a week. And you will begin to feel what I have felt all these years.When your dinner's ready, the timer on it will have expired. Then you can get to work.You guys ever been to New Orleans?Good morning.I didn't know if you took sugar and cream, so I got one of each.You designed the house at eight seven six Magnolia.I would love to see the plans of this house.Yes, it is.It's Cataleya.For something you can never understand.

I'll do my best.You in the kitchen. You, the bedroom. You, the back.Hey! What are you doing?He also said no names.HEY!She's a kid.What do you mean so what? You take a kid, teach them, they have value.Are you stupid or what? Here.Here's twenty asshole. Go do your job.Remember me Cataleya?I was at your confirmation. My name is Marco, and I was a very good friend of your father. I see he gave you his medal.The Cataleya orchid. His symbol. Your name. That's good. This way you will always remember him. I know this is a terrible thing for you to have seen.Some things are too complicated for a kid to understand. This is one of them. But I am going to try explain it and make it very simple for you. So you understand. Now, you know who Don Luis is?Of course you do. He was your father's best friend since they're kids. He's like an Uncle to you. You know he has always been good to your family, don't you?This house, the food you eat, the clothes you wear. Even your school fees. All this comes from Don Luis. You know that?But when someone is good to you and you are not good to them back, then bad things happen. Things like...This.I know you are a smart girl. You do well in school. So I know this is not too complicated for you to understand. Am I right?Good. Now, your father had something that belonged to Don Luis. A little thing. No bigger than...This. Maybe it was in this.Do you know what I am talking about?Excellent. Do you know where it is?Well, if you give it to me, Don Luis will be very grateful. And very generous. He will make sure that you are clothed, fed, and sent to the very best school. You will have everything you want.But if you don't give it to him, he will be very unhappy. And you see what happens when he is not happy, yes?So why don't you just give that little thing which belongs to him.

One...two...You will take up positions here...And here. And here. You must expect the unexpected. She is like mist under a door, like a mouse in the wall. She will never attack straight on. You will not see her, until it is too late. She is that invisible.We would prefer she be taken alive. But with a bitch like this, if you get a kill shot you take it.You four! Get the armored Mercedes! We have to get Don Luis out of here!Don Luis! This way! Everyone to their positions!Don Luis! You hide here.Wait for my call.
