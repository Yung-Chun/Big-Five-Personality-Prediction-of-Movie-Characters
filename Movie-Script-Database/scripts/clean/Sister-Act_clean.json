I'm... Sister Mary Clarence. And you're... young Christians. I guess I should assign you this passage. What's good? What were you talking about?Really.Well... yes.

At Sunday School?Probation?Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.Shut up!Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something? You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?I said I was a nun, not an asshole.And you listen to that?Hey, I know, it's hard. But do what I do.Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.Deal with it, sweet thing. It's important, nowadays. You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.Because a banana is part of a balanced breakfast. And don't forget fiber.Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough. I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age. I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.Have you been out in those streets? Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!Sometimes it's not enough!It never solves anything.In English?Not in years.Why?But don't you get money? From the Vatican?Oh, right. At my old place, we used to... wash cars. Groom dogs. So... nice loom.Just about. Show me again.I love my heddles. Show me again.Really catching on.I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!Look, this isn't my kind of thing! I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!Let me talk to Detective Eddie Mulcahy. It's an emergency. Real bad.Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.But I'm going insane! All these people do is pray and work, work and pray! I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food! Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet? Get me outta her!Like what?You son-of-a-bitch!But it's a nightmare! Mother Superior is out to get me! She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!Do you hear that? That choir? Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!THE HILLS ARE ALIVE WITH THE SOUND OF MUSIC...Yeah?What? What does she want now? I did the dishes. I oiled the pews. I dusted the hymnals. Two hundred hymnals. Why can't people share?What?A cigarette?Thanks. So which one are you? Sister Bruce? Sister Doug?Right. Okay. Bob. Nice to know you.So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?Three years. A rookie.Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time? You know, when do you take the final vows?Whoa! Bob! What's going on here? What'd I say?Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you? Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents? We can call the Enquirer.Excuse me?She won't? Why not?She said that? Reverend Mother?Well, then there's only one thing to do.Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life. In order to make a responsible decision. This is going to be very painful for me. You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent. Wait.Must I do this thing, 0 Lord? Please help me.,. yes, I know... I must put my selfish cares aside... I must think of others... yes, she's here... He says hi... yes, I understand... let thy will be done. Amen. You too.We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.We must... get you some experience. We must... leave this place.We hear you.I know it is. It's life. Experience. Take a deep breath.Now you.It's a start.How are you doing.You know it.It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program. How old are you? You shouldn't be smoking. Have you ever seen a diseased lung? Hand 'em over.And you, with the devil's brew passing through your lips. A mind is a terrible thing to waste.BobsRight.A couple of bowls of chili. And another round of these.Initiation. You understand. Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.And she wants to be a nun.This is your neighborhood. Your turf. You should get to know 'em.Better now.Time off. For bad behavior.Bob! What're you doing?You watch yourself!Good point. Especially that dude you were with. I'd like to see him down front.Honey.Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything. I mean, nothing really happened. We just... took a walk.Run!Keep moving!Climb! Now!Goddamn it!Experience!I don't know, some people just don't like nuns. I wish I had a ruler.What'd she say?Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?So... hi there.Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen!I know! I'm sorry I didn't mean for it to happen! And I was the one they were shooting at!A decent life? Excuse me? As what? A janitor?But you can't kick me out! Guys want to kill me! You're a nun! A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep? I mean, I'm a major sinner! All-time great! Hall of Fame! Aren't I, like, your dream come true? Your Olympic event?I am?What?No. No.Not the choir, please, anything but that. The choir -- I mean, have you heard them? I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that IIs this... choir practice?Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...Whatever.Um, I don't really know this one...Sure. Kind of... free-lance.What?Hold on.Well... With all due respect... let's have a look at this.LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED LET THY SOUL BE HEALEDMan. I sound like you guys.Mary Robert.Mary Robert, I've watched you. You never really sing. You whisper. Nothing comes out.Give me a C. A C!Louder! Like you're onstage.Like people are eating, and there's silverware, and you want them to hear you.Think about that guy you were dancing with!You see? We've got the voices. They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me. We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.The goods. The sound. The sale. Let's rearrange a few things. Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto. Get over here. Mary Robert --with the sopranos.Sister Alma -- a C.Middle section, hold that note, for dear life. Sopranos, an A. Sister Alma?Yeah, for one second. That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other. Be a group.Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you like discipline. Hard work.I hear you. How many days a week do you rehearse?No way. We're a choir, right? Headliners. The big room. Two days a week won't cut it. Every day.I don't know. Mary Lazarus, what do you think? They're pretty raw.A bunch of real mama's girls.It'll be hell.Ten-hut!That machine.It's a rhythm section. The beat.Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?Hold it. Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?So use it. When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration. Most music is. So don't hold back. Let all that joy go right into your voice. Make me happy. Let me hear it. Perk out. Perk down.Because we'reOne, two, three...What you say?But how?I think I hear it!You know, I just might!Sister Alma!Mary Robert!You know what we're saying!I think they hear you!I was thinking Las Vegas. Get some butts in those seats.Exactly. People like going to theaters and casinos. But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.Hold on. That's not fair. I worked hard with them. They gave up their free time, and they loved it. Those women are happy. And we can get even better. We can wake this place up.Please let me try. I'm begging you.Excuse me, Bishop. Reverend Mother has some other ideas too. She's too modest to talk about it, but she thinks we should get out of the convent and into the neighborhood more. This woman.You know Reverend Mother. Hides her light under a bushel. She has plans for us to move right onto the streets. Get to know people. Work with 'em.Don't you love her?WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PARTDon't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting. Make it look easy. Again!Hopeless IBabiesWe're here to pray for you, brother.We know you don't want to sell drugs. You just had an unhappy childhood, and maybe a learning disability. You just need someone to pray for you.And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse. And so you truly need our prayers.Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.You wanna call a cop?Can I get a witness?If we can stop you here, they can stop you there.Oh, I'm not special, Bob. It's just hard work... and prayer.Eddie! You scared the hell out of me!It wasn't my fault! They just showed up. It's helping the convent.I really can't talk about it now. The place is packed. SRO. I've got a show to do.I know that. This isn't about me. It's about the choir. You should hear them. They're good. Really good. And I taught them.I am?Really? Lieutenant?You mean -- worried about my testimony?Well.. thanks. I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes. I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here. I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.You're not... seeing anybody?I have?We're in a convent!I've got to go.I know, I know. I'll be careful. I'll try.Magic time!This Sunday's hymn is inspired by the lesson of Mary Magdalene. You know the one. Mary Magdalene was a young lady with a past. She was no stranger to sin. She was no stranger to practically everybody. Many condemned her. The whole neighborhood. But one man refused to do so. One man said, hey now, wait a minute. Listen to the story.Hey, girls.Jerusalem is a real drag. Everybody hates me.People throw stones. They call me names. I mean, really.But -- wait.That man -- who is he?He's... dreamy. He's...HE'S SO FINE...Jackpot! Two bucketsIt's better than sex!I imagine.What do you mean?Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?A vote?But... wait a minute...What?You sent for me?Hello?That soon?Great. That's good to hear.Right, right -- thanks.Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving. In just a couple of days.What?But -- why?But -- there's so much more to do right here. And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!Okay, so I just got things started. But you could build on that. You could keep it going.But...It's contraband. Don't ask. But I wanted to give you a treat. A sort of... thank-you gift.Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular. I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful. Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.That's true, wouldn't that be great. Of course, we never know when things are going to change. Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.Oh no. We'll always be together.Right to Hell. Just kidding. Where is that bus?Get moving. I'm right behind you.Eddie...?How?I can't go with you.I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral. We're singing for the Cardinals.Eddie -- I've got to go back. They won't sing without me. I'm deserting them.That's not the point! They need me!You don't get it! It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time. They're singing for the Cardinals. It's like... \"Star Search.\" If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.They're not nuns. They're like.. people. With one outfit.Even nuns have to pee.Okay, it's me. Mary Clarence. Christy. It's Chris Carter. I need some help here. I can't believe I'm doing this. Okay, look, I know I should just get back in the car, and get the hell out of here. Save my skin. I mean, it's not wrong, Vince really wants to kill me. Why do you make guys like Vince? But if I don't sing at St. Matthew's... Mary Robert. Mary Patrick. It means so much to them. They're counting on me -- and I like that. Maybe Reverend Mother is right, maybe I am a bad influence, maybe I'm just some Vegas slut, but... can we cut a deal here? I mean, I still don't believe in, like, most of the Commandments, and stuff in church still gives me the willies, but -- if I go back and sing, if I do a good deed, will you promise I won't get killed? All I want is a sign. Lightning. Thunder. Anything.No. No. Doesn't count...Oh my God...I'm late for church. Can I get a lift?Excuse me -- where's the rehearsal room?They're from my old convent.Run! Take off!She's got nothing to do with this. Let her go.Mary Robert, don't panic. Remember what we talked about? Experience?You can handle this.Go!Good evening, Vincent.I am sorry for all my sins. And yours.You will be judged, Vincent. We all will.I feel sorry for you, Vincent. And I forgive you.What?And God bless Joey and Willy, who are only trying to do their jobs. Pox fibula tibia vobiscum. Et marcus domino's pizza. Have mercy. Amen. I'm finished now. Help me up.Red 21.Did you learn something?What are you doing here?Quick, there's another way out of here. Follow me.Right here. Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.You know? About me? About everything?Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.You saved my life.That depends. Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news. I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.Then I guess you're stuck. Life sentence. No parole.Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent. So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?Yeah, like what?That used to be true, Vince. I was with you. But something happened. And I'm different now. Real--different. I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience. And I've got just two words for you. And those two words are...Bless you.Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one. Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?I don't think so. What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?What about me, Reverend Mother? I think you were right. I'm just a bad influence. Sister show biz.Really? And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?It's true!Don't you know it!What did He say?It's true -- I know her.What a shame!Pay attention...Were you wicked?Were you tempted?But I'm

And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed. Drugs. Gangs. Spandex. And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.And all those like you.Absolutely not. I mean the wicked. The heedless. And their Las Vegas concubines.Check your driver's license.Of course. But it's almost lunch.Before we do, you might like to freshen up. And you'll certainly want to changeWould you like that?Excused. Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all. While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are. You will not disrupt the convent. You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola. There are three vows that every nun must accept. The vow of poverty...The vow of obedience.And the vow of chastity.Good afternoon, Sisters. I apologize for my tardiness. I would like you to welcome a new member of our order, Sister Mary Clarence.Mary Clarence comes to us from a somewhat more progressive convent. She is eager for a more disciplined life, and will make every effort to conform to our ways.Yes, Mary Patrick?Very well. Mary Clarence, rise please.Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence. Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.Until sundown.And Mary Clarence?As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.A fast. To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.No food. Not until sundown.Yes. Until breakfast.This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.Your cell. Your room.Our lives are simple. We have little need for material possessions.Useless distractions.And whom would you call?Your cell is more than adequate.It is nine p.m. Pleasant dreams.I'm sure. If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life. And its direction. Or lack thereof.From all I've heard, just about everything. Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead.If you're fooling anyone, it's only yourself. God has brought you here. Take the hint.Sister Mary Patrick?I need to see you, at once. Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments. Mary Clarence?Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return. Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage. Do not attempt discussion. Am I understood?Come, Sister.Mary Clarence!A balloon and a banana! Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?This is a convent, not a clinic. We offer moral guidance, not hardware.We are nuns. We seek solutions through prayer.You are correct. Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation. Such as your own, for example. How do you feel about physical labor?Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27? He spoke unto a wastrel youth. He said, \"Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment.\"How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary Clarence. \"No pain, no gain.\"Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?Good. Mary Patrick, I need you in the office. Mary Clarence, carry on.Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!Yes -- thank you so much.I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity. To change. To make a decent life for yourself.Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.You may stay. But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.You have, I believe, some minimal background in music. Therefore, you are to join our choir.You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart. As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.You're my Olympic event.The choir, Mary Clarence. Go for the gold.Good morning, Sisters.Gospel. A jazz solo on the organ. What next? Jesus goes to Rio? Good Friday-a- go-go? What were you thinking?And what next? Popcorn? Curtain calls? This is not a theater. or a casino.Through blasphemy? You have corrupted the entire choir!Out of the question.And I am refusing. As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.Oh?Well... thank you.Perhaps.Really?Really...But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.That is indeed glorious news, Bishop. We will be honored to appear.And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.The council of Cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church. They command the utmost respect. Your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place.I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.Of course. Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state. Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole. A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?The majority has spoken.I am certain the presentation will be a great success. Congratulations, Mary Clarence. And congratulations to you all.You have a phone call.Really. Well, that makes two of us.I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara. Privately. I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.I must go where I can be of use.Indeed. After how long? A few weeks? I have been here thirty years. And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.A part of what? Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday. You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them. They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.You and I know that life is not so simple. There will be disappointments. Rude shocks. And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.I am sorry, Mary Clarence. I seem to have misplaced my tambourine. Good day, Mary Clarence.Good day.What's wrong?The rehearsal room!Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her. Pull yourselves together.She shouldn't have come back. She knew she was in danger.She isn't a nun. Her real name is Christy Van Cartier, and she is a professional entertainer. She witnessed a vicious crime, and has been hiding in our convent.Calm down. Think clearly. Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?But... she was a showgirl. She didn't have an old convent.All right. It's a beginning. Las Vegas, Nevada.Mary Lazarus, find the Bishop and tell him the situation. Everyone else -- follow me.Emergency! Open up!The San Francisco airport! Immediately!Young man!We are nuns. We pray.We pray for good things. Food for the hungry.However, we can also pray for other things.Come, Sisters. Let's go to chapel. Bring your beads.And Gommorah.But where?Stand back. Taxi!Brace yourselves, Sisters.Spread out and look for Mary Clarence. Try to blend in.Saving you. Move!Break!Sweetheart.I guarantee you, she is no broad. She is Sister Mary Clarence, of St. Katherine's Convent. She is a model of generosity, virtue and love. You have my word, gentlemen. She is a nun.Oh?I'm a Christian.Very well. I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent. For utterly disrupting our way of life. And for placing all of us in mortal danger. Thank-you.Yes?You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert. We shall have a serious discussion.Perhaps not.

I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!She says I should wait. She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life. She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet. In a mature manner.What?Of course! We must do it! It's the will of God! What is it?Are you sure?Are you sure this is what Reverend Mother had in mind?Mary Clarence!We need experience.Experience! Right?I have to do this.
