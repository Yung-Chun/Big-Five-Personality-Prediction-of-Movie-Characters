And you are giving us some of your foods.Big Brother.Big Brother. He is always having ideas.Witch woman. Nobody is talking to her because every person is fearing her.No trouble go follow me. I am a good boy.I have a good family.My Father was a teacher. But since war is making it so we have no more school, he is keeping busy.He and the Paramount Chief cut some of our land so that all of the refugees can be having a place to be staying. Mother is saying he is always doing good things.Mother. Before she was having children she was also being a teacher, but she is saying raising childrens is too too much work.My mother is always working hard for us and so I am thanking her by working hard too.Big Brother, he is more concerned with his muscles, and his skin. Sometimes I add to his products.Big Brother is also concerned with sleeping.I am not liking his music, and I am not like his dancing, and if he is playing it loud loud I do not know how this girl will be sleeping.I am going to church every Sunday with my family.Father is saying that Pastor is thinking he can be talking so much because he is having his Reverend Doctorate -- that is making him doctor of \"talking.\"God is liking music more than just talking so if we are singing and dancing, then He is listening to us well well.I...I got them from the Nigerians.But I earned-Yes, Father.\"-Buffer zone\". That is why so many refugee are coming here small small. Many people are suffering but we are not, here we are safe.I am not lucky. It is just because everyone is liking me.So she's crazy?Enh?I am a good boy. But sometimes I am sleeping outside so I am not having to go inside and be getting a beating.No beating?Where is Dike?Reverend Doctorate.Father, I am not seeing Dike.Father, where is Dike?I am not a \"little\" boy.Mother!Mama!And this is how it is starting.If I am closing my eye, I am seeing the rainy season and how in my village, they are saying it is always bringing change too fast. You can be finding that the whole world is washing away beneath your feets.You can be walking on road and finding that you are swimming in river. You can be starting day all dry and warm and then be finishing with your clothes like another skin on your body. Nothing is ever for sure and everything is always changing.I am not feeling my legs. It is like they are belonging to other PERSON-Will they be killing us?A forest spirit.This is what death is feeling like.My father is telling me to run. Run far far so the Army Soldier is not catching me and killing me. And then, and then I am just hiding in the bush and running running...Agu.Agu.Yes.Yes, sah.Mother, glory be to God in the Highest. I am still living... but I am soldier now.Botu botu botu.I carried ammunition and water all day.Which one of you is the dog?Mother, I am not knowing if I will ever be seeing you again. But Two-I- C is saying small small we are winning this war, and then, God willing, I can be finding you.They are calling him...What is zero-zero-one?It is Iroko. These other trees I am not knowing, but I am calling them children of the forest because they are smaller than the rest.Yes, sah.What do you mean?They are calling you Strika?Are you liking war?Are you liking killing?Is it easying to be doing?Are you fearing death?Are you having parent?I am still having mother. Somewhere.What is that you are chewing on?Are you liking Commandant?Are you stupid?Why are you not talking, then?It is tasting like licking rock. And eating pencil.I am almost laughing and almost dying, even though I am not feeling like laughing. Inside my stomach and heart it is feeling like fire from a pepper. I am only thinking about what is going to be happening.Mother, I have kill a man.It is the bad sin and I am feeling like I am dying inside, like each breath can be my last and my heart will stop its beating. But I am knowing, too, it is the right thing to be doing.Always be keeping it. If you are losing it, then they will be losing you.Botu, botu, botu.To always be leaving it off.What?Thank you, sah.Yes, sah.No, sah. I am happying to be following you, sah.I am following you, sah.Yes, sah. I am a good follower, sah.I am thinking she is in the Capital, sah.Yes, sah.I can be keeping this secret, sah.Strika. He is my only friend, Mother. His eye are too red, his teeth are too brown, his head is too too big, but he is my friend even if he is looking too ugly.My gun is making mark on my hand. I am servant to be doing whatever it says.God, help me to be doing the thing I am supposed to be doing.What is wrong with them?What is wrong with them? Why are they crying?Where is this battle?God, there is nothing to be keeping you from watching what we are doing.Mother?I am not recognizing you.I am not bad boy. I am not...You are not my mother! And you, you are not my sister!Enough!Devil is not blessing me. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!You are not my sister.You are not my mother.These people do not run.Maybe they are not seeing us because they are spirits. This is death's hometown.I am looking at him, and I am seeing he is not happy to be waiting.And I am seeing these people entering with more than they are having when they are leaving and I am wondering why they are leaving their things behind and if I should be telling them.And with every person that is coming, and every person that is going, I am seeing anger on Commandant's face grow.Give us water! Give us water, now!Imagination TV.Auntie! Auntie, bring us some chips!His spirit is fighting to be let free from his body. It is hurting because you are thinking about it. If you are stopping to think about it, there is nothing to be feeling. The thinking is the hurting.It is like God is turning his gaze on Two-I-C.Two-I-C is dead.It is taking Two-I-C all day to be dying, and then he is dying when the moon is full and the night is shining like silver.The the only way not to be fighting anymore is to be dying.Mother. If this war is ever ending I am thinking, I cannot be going back to doing child thing.We are just wild animals now with no place to be going.Bullet is just eating everything, leaf, tree, ground, person -- eating them -- just making person to bleed everywhere... so much blood.Strika? Strika! We are having to go or they will be leaving us.Let's go.Strika! We have to be going. Stand up and let's go!What is wrong with you?What is wrong?I am wanting to say to Strika, I am tired too.I am tired, and so the words are not coming out of my mouth.I will be an old man before this war is over...Enh... Strika, a song. Music. Like my mother sings...Strika?Strika?Mother, your song is making my body to move and I am not having to think anymore, not about Strika, not about this war, not about any of the thing that are jumping into my head.He is dead.Him.I want to be going to that person who is singing and taking all of the sound so I can be keeping it in my pocket, to be having it for myself.I am wanting to lie down on the warm ground with my eye closed and the smell of mud in my nose, just like Strika.I am wanting to feel how the ground is wet all around my body so that if I am sweating, I am feeling like it is the ground sweating through me.And I am wanting to stay in this same place forever, never moving for anything, just waiting waiting until dust is piling on me and grasses is covering me and insect is making their home in the space between my teeths.One onina tree will be growing from my body, so wide that its trunk is separating night and day and so tall that its top leaf is tickling the moon until the man living there is smiling.Commandant, suh. We are out of bullets.They are dead.Sun, why are you even thinking to shine on this world. I am wanting to catch you in my hand, to be squeezing until the color is dripping out from you forever. That way everywhere it is always dark and nobody is ever having to see any of the terrible thing that is happening in this world.In heaven, it is always morning.I am not knowing how long I am staying here, but I am staying here for a long time -- some week, some month -- I am not knowing. All I am knowing is how it is feeling here.Sometimes I am eating even if I am not hungrying too much because I am fearing that the food is finishing for the next day.I am liking the clothes is clean and dry and it is not having any hole from bullet or blood from the last person who is wearing it.I am not knowing all what he is meaning. The only thing that is making sense to me is memory that I am having of another boy -- Strika - - sleeping next to me, so close because we are the only people protecting each other from all of the thing trying to kill us.The only thing I am knowing is the sound of people coughing and screaming, and the smell of going to toilet and dead body. And the feeling of the brown brown and djamba in my blood.Confession and Forgiveness and resurrection.Don't go Preacher.Yes, I am having Bible, but I am using to be holding my drawing down on my desk so the fan is not throwing them everywhere.Amy. She is always looking at me like looking at me is going to be helping me.She thinks that my not speaking is because I can't be explaining myself like baby... but I am not like baby, I am like old man and she is like small girl because I am fighting in war and she is not even knowing what war is.I am thinking about my future.Botu botu botu.I am seeing more terrible thing than ten thousand men and I am doing more terrible thing than twenty thousand men.So, if I am saying these thing that I do, then it will be making me to sadding too much and you too sadding to much in this life. I am wanting to be happy in this life because of everything I am seeing. I am just wanting to be happy.If I am telling this to you it will be making you to think that I am some sort of beast or devil. I am all of this thing.

Who is catching this thing?Strika. Is it you who is finding this thing?Enh! Strika? Untie him. So all of you grown men here, and it is Strika who is finding a prisoner?(addressing Strika butHere? Is that right... where is Two- I-C? Two-I-C!What are we to be doing with this thing?A boy.A boy is nothing? A boy is harmless?Does a boy not have eyes to see?A boy has hands to strangle!And fingers to pull a trigger. BUAH!A boy is not harmless.A boy is very dangerous. Strika, are you trying to be eating this boy?I am looking at you. You are not seeming like soldier to me. Show me your fingers.Your hands are like babies hands. What were you doing here? Why are you just laying by the ground like one dead rat?I said wait. You are from Alpha Town?You should be telling me.Just tell me and I will be helping you.And where is this your father?Alpha Town? The army is killing your father?We have just come from Alpha Town. It is burned to the ground.Are you hungry?Thirsty?If you are wanting drink, you will drink, but that is having to wait until you are telling me your name. Are you hearing me?Everybody is calling me Commandant. What is everybody always calling you?Say it like you are proud of it.Agu, enh? Well, that is what I will be calling you then.Leave this one with me. I will take this one under my charge, turn him into a warrior. Is that what you want? Do you want to be fighting the Army that is killing your father?You should be saying yes.Say yes, sah.Move on!Two-I-C.This baby boy is your responsibility now. Train him.I am not eating people, Hope-You can eat a man and take their power, it is true, but I taste their fear in the meats. I can take their juju just by looking at them in the eyes, so why must I eat their fear?Native Defense Forces!The rains are coming, Gentlemen.You are knowing what that is meaning. Mosquitoes, sickness, muddy squalor. Suffering if we are caught with our \"soldiers\" hanging out.You, Hope, and you, Rambo, you are not from the same tribe as him. But you are brothers before your enemy.What drove us to this larger family of strangers? Fear?War?We have defended ourselves against criminal rapings and killings of our own people, first by the PLF, and now by the NRC government.But this has awakened a sleeping beast, Gentlemen. It has put the weapons of this war in the hands of you, the young, and therefore, the powerful.All of you, who were never listened to before, who have seen your loved ones gunned down, you have something that speaks for you now.They are licking their wounds. They are feeling our sting. We, along with our other brothers fighting further south under Dada Goodblood, we command and control what the NRC needs.Reformation of what? Money. Old men and money.War has spoiled their minds, Gentlemen. So they could have \"their turn to eat.War is a disease. It sickens and infects.You want to be a \"big man\", or a \"small boy\"?When there is an infection in your foot. A deadly deathly sickness in your limb that's going to kill you slow slow, what do you do?So maybe they should be calling us the doctor army and not the hunter army? We have to be cutting off that leg to save the body. That is how you prevent the NRC/PLF infection from spreading.Young men! Gentlemen! We will not wait to inherit it, we will not wait for them to just give it to us, we will take it, we will seize it from their rotting and decaying old hands.Victory!The spirits have blessed you and cleansed you. To the enemy, you are invincible. But there are rules you must follow to keep the spirits happy, to remain pure.Agu, you are a soldier now. The only way is forward. Do not be leaving any nice thing for the NRC or the PLF to be using if they are coming to this place.You are knowing this tree?When this tree is small, it is looking so so like a cassava plant, except that it has thorns.It is even having a root like a cassava, but if you eat it, it will kill you with its poison.That is why you must be knowing how to use your thorns. You kill before you are killed.You will see the enemy is having small boy soldiers, too, who can kill before they can even speak.I have seen them do things that are even making the Devil fall to his knee to beg for mercy.Have you killed a man before?You will. Today.You will destroy anything that threatens us. As I would anything that threatens you, understand?Two-I-C, report.On the floor!Disarm and disrobe them!Agu, come here, enh. Come here right now. Come here. These are the dogs who killed your father.Agu, you will kill this man.Open it.No, no, this won't do.Rambo, seize him, hold his ass to the ground.Agu. See this thirsty goat. These are the tyrants who murdered your father. Now look at him.Remember what they have taken from you. Remember your suffering and turn it into hate for them.God and the spirit of your Father is wanting you to kill him.Like this. Just bring this hand up and knock him well well.Use all of your force, imagine the blade sinking deep into him like chopping a coconut.Yes! That is how you are dealing with the NRC. Do it again! And again and again until he shuts up.Watch his blood, Agu. That is justice. That is what God wanted.Always keep it with you.You are my Special Guards now. Both of you.CSO. Take note and act accordingly.Agu and Strika are now my Special Guards.Gentlemen! Cover! Cover!...ooh, and they are having so many foods to be eating......chicken, and cow, and goat, and vegetable, and fruit, any kind of fish you are wanting because the fishermen are always bringing everything from the sea. There is nothing they are not having in this place...The best thing this town, this town of abundant resources, is all the womens.Ah, woman in this place are just too beautiful. If you just see women here, before you are even knowing it, your soldier is standing at full `tenshun. They are having breasts so soft and so round that their clothes are rejoicing to be holding them. And they are having bottoms with specs so nice that anytime they are sitting down, the ground is also rejoicing. They are knowing well well how to make a man feel good with their kissing and loving, kai! The last time I am in this place, enh, my soldier is hurting too much for me to even be easing myself.You all will see, because that is where we are going, gentlemen. You will see it all with your own eyes.Who is this?Well, let us be giving their village back, huh?Two-I-C?Report.Can you take the bridge?Explain.But nothing. Take the bridge, that is your task.Sustain.Agu, Strika, come here. Look at this.This is a very special device, you can be seeing the enemy with it, even when they are hiding.You see?It's magic. I need volunteers! Who has heart? Who wants to fight with me? Who isn't afraid of bullets!?Chicken Legs, go!These bullets?They are nothing. No one can touch us!Are you afraid?Moove it! Gentlemen! Moooooove it!No retreat! No surrender! Men dropping! Men moving!Agu, let me be see your aim, hit that man.Agu, it is on safety, what was Two- I-C teaching you?Off. How will you be firing quickly if it is in safety? Enh? Listen.Like that.Sit.You fought bravely today, Agu.You see what happens when the men listen to me?You are wanting to know how to be leading?That is good, Agu, because there is no learning to be leading. Some men is born to leading, other is born to following, and other is only waiting to be dying.No, Agu. You are different. You are reminding me of me when I was a little boy, and this means you are borning to be leader. But even the best leader Agu, must first be learning to be good follower. Sometimes I even have to be following the Supreme Commander, if when I am not agreeing.You are seeing this place. Supreme Commander is saying this is important. So it is important for me then.If we get this place, then we can go to Taro. Is that where your mother is?After Goodblood greets us, we all will be going to the Capital, that is a certainty.I am wanting to be helping you more than the others, Agu.But do not be telling anyone I am helping you like this, this will be our secret. Can you be keeping this secret, Agu?Then be saying it.In this family where I am being father, we cannot have the other children getting jealous, Agu!Kneel down in front of me. You do me this thing.I am not punishing you, Agu. I am helping you, to care for you.This is what commanding officer is supposed to be doing to his best boy soldier. Play with him, cherish him, protect him, enh?Touch my soldier, Agu, with your mouth. This is a command. You took an oath to obey, and now obey.No one in the land we are going is your friend. They are the farmers who feed your enemy.The farmers' wives whose breasts feed babies who will grow to join the enemy ranks, whose wombs breed more of them.This is the nature of the place we are going. The homeland of the collaborators and traitors. Our people's blood has flowed for year. Now must their blood flow, too. Let us pray to the spirits and God.God, be guiding us in everything we are about to be doing. Give us the strength to fulfill your justice.See, now it is your time to eat.He is summoning us.Load up!To Taro -- The Town of Abundant Resources.No.What is happening to this one?Leave one living. Tell him to run north, to the next village, and to the next village after that, tell him to tell everyone that soon we come. This is just the beginning.Home, Agu.I am.What kind of welcome is this, enh, for a hero battalion?Thank you Deputy.I have been asked to leave my men on the edge of town.When can they enter? I have-You will bring something to drink for us. Water.What is this? This is just another room. Where is our water?Where are you putting us to be sleeping?Supreme Commander, sah.I'm sorry you were feeling weak, sah.I am hungry. Two-I-C, bring me a plate.What is this, Chief? Why are you making me wait?Something has changed, what is it?We are not taking the Capital?Chief, to protect our people, we have the force and the momentum, why stop, why wait?Then what is your plan for my battalion? Are you not making me General?Two-I-C get out.You are taking my battalion?And for my services, Chief? I built this battalion. I am their father.And payment? What share of the resources will I have, for this honor?I have not Chief. I am not a politician, I am a soldier.I will have one last night with them.Assemble the C/Os, take the troops and bivouac outside of town. I am taking Two-I-C with some of the boys to celebrate.You will see. You will like it.If you and Strika are my bodyguard, then if I am going, you are also going, you are hearing me?Ma. Bring something that will satisfy my soldiers and my soldier!Bring beer! Bring soda! Bring it all!How is it warm?No ice!?Bring the drink. We will be drinking it even if it is warm.Negative. You'll be staying here so we can celebrate you. In fact, Mama, why don't you bring a special one for my Two-I-C, who will soon be the Co-mman-dan-tttt. Who's your Commandant?But you have one special for Two-I- C?Hey Mama, this one's fresh papaya.Don't you be worrying about money, ma. Bring me a good girl, you know my specifications.What is happening? Huh? What happened?What happened to my man? Wh- What happened here?Relax, relax, relax! You did this! You did this!Go!Let's go! Let's go! Enh! Pick him up! I want you to take all their women! All of them!Agu? Is that you.Agu. Come. Sit down with me.It is dangerous times now, Agu. Can't be trusting nobody. That is why it is always good to be sleeping with one eye open. And that is why I have you and Strika.Sometimes Agu, sometimes I am feeling sorry for you.Sometimes I am.You are my new Two-I-C.This was not God's work. This was man's. The Supreme Commander was our friend. Now he is our enemy. But we are not fearing change... for we are strong!That is why we should be taking our own territory and filling our own pockets. Move out.Kai! This fog, Agu. It is our friend.It was not supposed to be the way it has come to be, Agu.Who are dead?EVERYONE-Everyone betrays you, eventually. But, I will always look out for you, Agu. I will look out for you because you are my son.And a son always protects his father.What is all this noise?Who and who is leaving?Who is leaving?Two-I-C, go back to your post.You are the only one stupid standing in front of me.I see. I see you are a big man now, Two-I-C. And where will you be going? You will surrender to the other NDF? No. They will eat you. And to the ECOMOD? That would be wiser, but, then what? Jail? War crimes? If they let you go, you think you will ever have it as good as you have it right now in this mud? You think that you will be able to just do what you want in \"peace\"?You all will go back to your towns, but they will fear you. Your families will not associate with you. You will be nobodies, with your poor, uneducated minds. And you will sit all day, and you will watch the sun rise and set, waiting with thousands of others for some big man to come along and say \"I have some job for you.\"Orphans. You are all orphans like me. You think I will let you waste what little time you have left on this earth drinking black tea and playing draughts with your gun powder tea.Agu?What are you thinking?You want to kill me?You want to surrender?Then surrender.When you are poor and hungry with nothing to do with your nothing days, you will remember these days as your best. And know, one day I will call on you again. And you will come. Because you will remember this, and you will come running.

If this were...The new regime needs to control the trade in resources for the international community to waste time recognizing them.You see, the colonists have never left Africa. Our very own politicians will steal our resources and give them away for pennies in exchange for private payoffs...but...The Grass People in the South East control the lumber and gold, the Clay and Charcoal people in the South West, diamonds and rare metals, and the Coastal people, petroleum and fisheries. This is the reason the NRC are trying so hard to be calling themselves a \"reformation council.\"They have spit on the constitution. They have spit on your rights. They have tried to spit on your future.That is why we must not forget that we are the protectors of the people!The richness of our nation is for the young.Tomorrow we mobilize for major action, uniting all of our brother warriors under Supreme Commander Dada Goodblood, and with God's blessing, end this plague, end this war, end our oppression!Why not the cutlass?If you are losing it, then I will be losing you.Cover!Commandant, sir!Refugees, sir. They say the PLF and the NRC took their village three days ago. They killed most, but let these ones go.Roger.We are facing heavy fire, suh.I don't know, suh.It's very difficult, suh.
