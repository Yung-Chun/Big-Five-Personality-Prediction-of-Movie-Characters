Should a whelp snap at your fingers, you crush it's fucking skull.You fucked up.Yes. You do.Use that tone with me again......and I'll serve your eye to you in your martini.Am I understood?It wasn't the \"what you did\", Iosef, which draws my ire, but \"who you did it to\".Careful, son... that old man happens to be three years younger than I.His name is John Wick... ...and when he was fifteen, he lied his way into the marines and headed off to Vietnam. He specialized in force-oriented reconnaissance, meaning he often crossed over into enemy territory to both collect information and -should the opportunity present itself- fuck with the enemy in whatever way that he saw fit.John earned four hundred and seventeen confirmed kills over the course of his five tours. The majority of those were done by hand, by blade, and by small caliber... which is unheard of.It got to him, though. Hell... How could it not? Even though he won every military distinction on record, including the Medal of HONOR--John was eventually discharged - with high honors, of course- and found himself in the city......lookin' for work.What kind do you think?John was the goddamned boogeyman; give him a name, request a method, and he'd get it done. Come hell or high water, by God... he'd get it done.Then one day, he fell in love and left the game. The years scrolled past, age set in, and he -like myself- had to watch the love of his life die. Suddenly alone, with no family to speak of, John deserved to live -and die- in peace. Instead...You went and killed his fucking dog.Until I say otherwise, you are under house arrest. Am I understood?John Wick. Good God...Sweet dreams.Yes?Of course he did. Put the word out. Two million to the man who kills John Wick. Three million to the man who delivers him intact.Good, good. I've a favor to ask. One that pays quite well.Wait in the car.Is that really necessary?So be it.No, thank you.It's been what? 30 years?Left the game, got married, settled down... I envy that. Kids?Lucky bastard.I fucked a bartender and -ta dah!- nine months later, I had me a piece a' shit tossed on the old doorstep, but... when it comes down to it... He's still my son.Funny how one would both die and kill for something they do not love.Goodbye, John.Kill him.DRIVE!People don't change. Do they, John? SHUT... THE FUCK... UP!Where's the manager?I'd run, too. What a shame... what a fucking... ...shame...Iosef... my son... is worth less than this... far less... treasures reduced to ash... ...ash...Tell me, John... and please... be honest... am I dying here?For me to die like this...I was sending Iosef to a safe house in Moscow.
