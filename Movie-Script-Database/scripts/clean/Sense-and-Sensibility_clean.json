{"Sense-and-Sensibility": {"ELINOR": {"raw_line": "Consider, Mamma! We have nowhere to go.I shall start making inquiries for a new house at once. Until then we must try to bear their coming.Marianne, cannot you play something else? Mamma has been weeping since breakfast.I meant something less mournful, dearest.Margaret, are you there? Please come down. John and Fanny will be here soon.Because houses go from father to son, dearest not from father to daughter. It is the law.If you come inside, we could play with your atlas.As you know, we are looking for a new home. When we leave we shall be able to retain only Thomas and Betsy.We are very sorry to have to leave you all. But we are certain you will find the new Mrs Dashwood a fair and generous mistress.How is Mrs Ferrars?You have two brothers, have you not?Betsy has it, I think. What does Fanny want with the silver?Presents for the servants. Have you seen Margaret? I am worried about her. She has taken to hiding in the oddest places.You do your best. You have not said a word to her for a week.Pray, when may we expect the pleasure of your brother's company?There is but one consolation if Edward is anything like Fanny, we shall be only too happy to leave.Too expensive. We do not need four bedrooms, we can share.Marianne, we have only five hundred pounds a year. I will send out more inquiries today.Won't you come out, dearest? We haven't seen you all day. Mamma is very concerned.I believe so.Oh! No, no indeed. She is quite wrong. For I believe it is in--in Belgium.Of course. The Volga, which, as you know, starts in...St Albans.That was my father's favourite.Thank you so much for your help with Margaret, Mr Ferrars. She is a changed girl since your arrival.Has she shown you her tree-house?With pleasure.Margaret has always wanted to travel.What will your duties be?Ah.As?And what do you wish for?Would you stay in London?You talk of feeling idle and useless imagine how that is compounded when one has no choice and no hope whatsoever of any occupation.Except that you will inherit your fortune.We cannot even earn ours.Right?It was you who asked him to read and then you made him nervous.But your behaviour to him in all other respects is perfectly cordial so I must assume that you like him in spite of his deficiencies.Praise indeed!Do without me?Marianne, there is no question of that is, there is no under standing between...I do not attempt to deny that I think very highly of him that I greatly esteem that I like him.Very well. Forgive me. Believe my feelings to be stronger than I have declared but further than that you must not believe.Go to bed!We cannot possibly afford him.Your education?Indeed?Plymouth?No.Pratt?Let us only settle in for a few days, Sir John, and thank you--Indeed. I am surprised they did not offer us their clothing.No more sugar then.Oh no, Sir John, I do not--How long have you known the Colonel?On what grounds?What became of the lady?Oh no, please, dear Mrs Jennings, leave the poor Colonel alone.Mrs Jennings is a wealthy woman with a married daughter--she has nothing to do but marry off everyone else's.Infirmity!It is a miracle your life has extended this far...A slight ache' I believe was his phrase...We are not engaged, Mamma.I am by no means assured of his regard for me.But even were he to feel such a... preference, I think we should be foolish to assume that there would not be many obstacles to his choosing a woman of no rank who cannot afford to buy sugar...In such a situation, Mamma, it is perhaps better to use one's head.Which invariably means it will.In here, sir--this way. Margaret, open the door wider. Please, sir, lay her here. Marianne, are you in pain?Is he human?She feels no pain, Mamma. Margaret, ask Betsy to make up a cold compress, please.And economy--ten words at most.You must change, Marianne--you will catch a cold.You will care very much when your nose swells up.We have decided to give you to the Gypsies.Marianne! Sir John and the Colonel are leaving.I will put these in water.Good work, Marianne! You have covered all forms of poetry; another meeting will ascertain his views on nature and romantic attachments and then you will have nothing left to talk about and the acquaintanceship will be over.No, but Mr Willoughby can be in no doubt of your enthusiasm for him.No particular reason, Marianne, only that we know so little of him--Or seven hours in this case.I know. Do not trouble yourself, Marianne.There is nothing under tenpence a pound. We have to economise.No. Just not to eat beef.But as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks, do you not begin to doubt your own discretion?Good morning, Colonel!Thank you, Colonel, we shall be delighted.Yes. Marianne does not approve of hiding her emotions. In fact, her romantic prejudices have the unfortunate tendency to set propriety at naught.Rather too unspoilt, in my view. The sooner she becomes acquainted with the ways of the world, the better.I would be delighted. But Sir John and Mrs Jennings are too excessive in their compliments. I am sure to disappoint.Nonsense.Really, Willoughby!Why should you dislike him?With dark, narrow stairs, a poky hall and a fire that smokes?Or the money.Shhh!Meg, dearest, please ask Betsy to make a cup of hot tea for Marianne.They must have quarreled.Then why did he not say as much? It is not like Willoughby to be secretive. Did he think Marianne was richer than she is?I can hardly tell you. But why was his manner so guilty?No, he loves her, I am sure.But has he left her with any assurance of his return? Cannot you ask her if he has proposed?There was something so underhand in the manner of his leaving.Not resolved--Mamma, I am very fond of Willoughby--Our discussion?I cannot imagine so.My dear Miss Steele--You have my permission to ask any manner of question, if that is of any help.With Fanny's mother? No, I have never met her.I had no idea at all that you were connected with that family.What do you mean? Do you have an understanding with Fanny's brother Robert?Edward?Edward Ferrars?I am sorry, but we surely--we cannot mean the same Mr Ferrars?Mr Pratt! Yes, I believe he has.Perfectly well, thank you.On the contrary.I give you my word.Mrs Jennings, you are very kind, but we cannot possibly leave our mother...With you in the room?Nothing of significance.I should imagine not.You are fortunate, over such a lengthy engagement, never to have had any doubts on that score.Indeed Miss Steele, I know of no such plan.John and Fanny are in town. I think we shall be forced to see them.I think it was for next door.Colonel Brandon, what a pleasure to see you! Have you been in London all this while?Very well, thank you.Colonel, is there anything--Colonel, though neither one has informed me of their under standing, I have no doubt of their mutual affection.What do you mean?No, for I do not expect any, Mrs Jennings. I have very little acquaintance in town.Marianne, is anything wrong?We do.Yes.I am well, thank you, Mr Willoughby.We are all extremely well, Mr Willoughby--thank you for your kind inquiry.Marianne! Come away!Dearest, do not betray what you feel to everyone present! This is not the place for explanations--Marianne, please tell me--You have no confidence in me.I have nothing to tell.It is perhaps fortunate that none of them knows of your engagement. Excuse me.Oh, Marianne.Marianne, oh, Marianne--it is better to know at once what his intentions are. Dearest, think of what you would have felt if your engagement had carried on for months and months before he chose to put an end to it.But you wrote to him! I thought then that he must have left you with some kind of understanding?Not so unworthy! Did he tell you that he loved you?He has broken faith with all of us, he made us all believe he loved you.I cannot tell you.Marianne, there is no excuse for him-- this is his hand--There is no one to take us.We have no money--and indeed we owe Mrs Jennings more courtesy.I will find a way. I promise.Thank you for coming, Colonel.I must get her home as quickly as possible. The Palmers can take us as far as Cleveland, which is but a day from Barton--I confess that is precisely what I had hoped for. Marianne suffers cruelly, and what pains me most is how hard she tries to justify Mr Willoughby. But you know her disposition.You have something to tell me of Mr Willoughby.Disappeared!Good God. Do you mean--Willoughby?Yes! He left us that morning, without any explanation!--and so abandoned Marianne for Miss Grey and her fifty thousand pounds.Have you seen Mr Willoughby since you learned...?Is Beth still in town?Dearest, was I right to tell you?Whatever his past actions, whatever his present course, at least you may be certain that he loved you.I hope you are enjoying your stay with John and Fanny, Miss Steele?No, I cannot.Indeed?Do ask him to come up.Mr Ferrars, what a pleasure to see you. You... know Miss Steele, of course.Do sit down, Mr Ferrars.Let me call Marianne, Mr Ferrars. She would be most disappointed to miss you.He must have had his reasons for going.Since the evening Mrs Jennings offered to take us to London.Lucy told me in the strictest confidence.I could not break my word.He made me no promises. He tried to tell me about Lucy.Would you have him treat her even worse than Willoughby has treated you?Edward made his promise a long time ago, long before he met me. Though he may... harbour some regret, I believe he will be happy--in the knowledge that he did his duty and kept his word. After all--after all that is bewitching in the idea of one's happiness depending entirely on one person, it is not always possible. We must accept. Edward will marry Lucy--and you and I will go home.What do you know of my heart? What do you know of anything but your own suffering? For weeks, Marianne, I have had this pressing on me without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature. It was forced upon me by the very person whose prior claims ruined all my hopes. I have had to endure her exultation again and again while knowing myself to be divided from Edward forever. Believe me, Marianne, had I not been bound to silence I could have produced proof enough of a broken heart even for you.It is indeed so. Are you acquainted with Mr Ferrars?Colonel, I am sure he would be only too delighted to hear it from your own lips.Mr Ferrars.Thank you for responding so promptly to my message.Mr Ferrars--Mr Ferrars, I have good news. I think you know of our friend Colonel Brandon?Colonel Brandon desires me to say that, understanding you wish to join the clergy, he has great pleasure in offering you the parish on his estate at Delaford, now just vacant, in the hope that it may enable you--and Miss Steele--to marry.Yes. He means it as testimony of his concern for--for the cruel situation in which you find yourselves.The unkindness of your family has made you astonished to find friendship elsewhere.You are very much mistaken. I assure you that you owe it almost entirely to your own merit--I have had no hand in it.He is the kindest and best of men.I think he felt it would be better coming from... a friend.You will always have it.Mr Ferrars, you honour your promises-- that is more important than anything else. I wish you--both--very happy.I do not think she drew breath from the moment we left London. It is my fault--I should have found some other way of getting home.We shall be home soon enough. Mamma will comfort you, dearest.I think it is going to rain.You always say that and then it always does.She is taking a little air in the garden.I cannot see Marianne.I think Marianne may need a doctor.Mr Palmer, that is very kind. But Colonel Brandon and Dr Harris will look after us. Thank you for everything you have done.Colonel, you have done so much already.She would be easier if her mother were here.There is no one there, dearest.Marianne, Marianne, please try--Marianne, please try--I cannot--I cannot do without you. Oh, please, I have tried to bear everything else-- I will try--but please, dearest, beloved Marianne, do not leave me alone.My mother!Mamma! She is out of danger!I am here, dearest, I am here.Poor Willoughby. He will always regret you.Do you compare your conduct with his?Our situations were very different.Did--No, Mamma.I am very good at hiding.Mamma?There is a painful difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event and its final certainty.I do not think it is the Colonel.Then you--are not married.Your mother, I suppose, will hardly be less angry with Robert for marrying Lucy.--no doubt

count it. What are you doing?Fortunate girl. At least she can escape Fanny, which is more than any of us is able.I have! I have said 'yes' and 'no'.Good morning, Fanny.How did you find the silver? Is it all genuine?Intolerable woman!How do you like your view, Mr Ferrars?This one, then?No, Edward! Listen.Can you not feel his despair? Try again.Mamma, look. This has just arrived.Even Elinor must approve the rent.No I will fetch her.Why?By no means. Edward is very amiable.But there is something wanting. He is too sedate his reading last night.Can he love her? Can the ardour of the soul really be satisfied with such polite, concealed affections? To love is to burn to be on fire, all made of passion, of adoration, of sacrifice! Like Juliet, or Guinevere or Heloise.Pathetic! To die for love? How can you say so? What could be more glorious?The more I know of the world, the more I am convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can truly love.I do not! I require only what any young woman of taste should a man who sings well, dances admirably, rides bravely, reads with passion and whose tastes agree in every point with my own.Is love a fancy, or a feeling? No It is immortal as immaculate truth 'Tis not a blossom shed as soon as Youth Drops from the stem of life for it will grow In barren regions, where no waters flow Nor ray of promise cheats the pensive gloom--What a pity it is that Edward has no passion for reading.Me?I think him everything that is amiable and worthy.But he shall have my unanswering devotion when you tell me he is to be my brother.How shall I do without you?I am sure you will be very happy. But you must promise not to live too far away.Do you love him?Esteem him! Like him! Use those insipid words again and I shall leave the room this instant!'Is love a fancy or a feeling?' Or a Ferrars?'I do not attempt to deny that I think highly of him greatly esteem him! Like him!'Did he? Well, I will wager he will do so in less than a fortnight!Margaret, you know perfectly well there is no such person.Sir John, might I play your pianoforte?As for you, you have no right, no right at all, to parade your ignorant assumptions--I told you nothing--That is not the point. You do not speak of such things before strangers--Mrs Jennings is not everyone.I do not know any duets. Forgive me, Colonel.Oh! Are we never to have a moment's peace? The rent here may be low but I think we have it on very hard terms.It is too ridiculous! When is a man to be safe from such wit if age and infirmity do not protect him?Did you not hear him complain of a rheumatism in his shoulder?I am taking you for a walk.You need another.It is not going to rain.Is there any felicity in the world superior to this?Look! There is some blue sky! Let us chase it!Help me!Margaret, run home and fetch help.Only my ankle.Do not be alarmed, Mamma.His name! His name!Mr John Willoughby of Allenham!He lifted me as if I weighed no more than a dried leaf!And spirit and wit and feeling.And he is to come tomorrow!What care I for colds when there is such a man?You are right. Help me, Elinor.But what do you know of Mr Willoughby, Sir John?But what is he like?What are his tastes? His passions? His pursuits?Thank you so much, Colonel.I have no intention of 'setting my cap' at anyone, Sir John!Goodbye, Colonel. Thank you for the flowers.You have found out my name!How beautiful. These are not from the hothouse.But I have always preferred wild flowers!Without a doubt, mine is 116.'0, no! it is an ever-fixed mark.'Goodbye! Thank you!I suppose I have erred against decorum. I should have been dull and spiritless and talked only of the weather, or the state of the roads.Why should he doubt it? Why should I hide my regard?But time alone does not determine intimacy. Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other and seven days are more than enough for others.I feel I know Mr Willoughby well already. If I had weaker, more shallow feelings perhaps I could conceal them, as you do--I am sorry, Elinor, I did not meanI do not understand her, Mamma. Why does she never mention Edward? I have never even seen her cry about him, or about Norland.If there was any true impropriety in my behaviour, I should be sensible of it, Elinor--If the impertinent remarks of such as Mrs Jennings are proof of impropriety, then we are all offending every moment of our lives--I should be delighted to join you, Colonel!The Colonel has invited us to Delaford, Willoughby!A Broadwood Grand! Then I shall really be able to play for you!There are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure. I think he wrote the letter himself as a trick for getting out of it.Exactly!Willoughby, we are always alone!Of course. I shall ask Mamma if I may stay behind from church.Nothing! Please do not ask me questions!Please let me be!How like a winter hath my absence been from thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year! What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen! What old December's bareness everywhere!London!I was never so grateful in all my life as I am to Mrs Jennings. What a kind woman she is! I like her more than I can say. Oh, Elinor! I shall see Willoughby. Think how surprised he will be! And you will see Edward!Are you asleep?I do not believe you feel as calm as you look, not even you, Elinor. I will never sleep tonight! Oh, what were you and Miss Steele whispering about so long?Yes, you are right.Oh, Elinor! It is Willoughby, indeed it is!Oh! Excuse me, Colonel--Where is dear Edward, John? We expect to see him daily.Are there any messages, Pigeon?No message at all? No cards?Nothing at all. Go back to sleep.Of course! I had not thought of-- thank you, Mrs Jennings!Willoughby!Good God, Willoughby! Will you nor shake hands with me?Willoughby, what is the matter? Why have you not come to see me? Were you not in London? Have you nor received my letters?For heaven's sake, Willoughby, tell me what is wrong!Willoughby!Go to him, Elinor--force him to come to me.Do not ask me questions!This reproach from you! You, who confide in no one.Nor I. We have neither of us anything to tell. I because I conceal nothing and you because you communicate nothing.'My dear Madam--I am quite at a loss to discover in what point I could be so unfortunate as to offend you. My esteem for your family is very sincere but if I have given rise to a belief of more than I felt or meant to express, I shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded. My affections have long been engaged elsewhere and it is with great regret that I return your letters and the lock of hair which you so obligingly bestowed upon me. I am etc. John Willoughby.'We are not engaged.No--he is not so unworthy as you think him.Yes. No--never absolutely. It was every day implied, but never declared. Sometimes I thought it had been, but it never was. He has broken no vow.He did! He did--he loved me as I loved him.I cannot believe his nature capable of such cruelty!But it cannot be his heart! Oh, Mamma! I want Mamma! Elinor, please take me home! Cannot we go tomorrow?Cannot we hire a carriage?All she wants is gossip and she only likes me because I supply it! Oh, God! I cannot endure to stay.Of course.But not enough. Not enough.Edward! I heard your voice! At last you have found us!Oh, don't think of me--Elinor is well, you see, that must be enough for both of us!Not at all. The sight of you is all the pleasure it has afforded, is that not so, Elinor?Why have you taken so long to come and see us?Engaged elsewhere! But what was that when there were such friends to be met?No, indeed--for Edward is the most fearful of giving pain and the most incapable of being selfish of anyone I ever saw.Edward, will you not sit? Elinor, help me to persuade him.But you are only just arrived!Why did you not urge him to stay?His reason was no doubt your coldness. If I were Edward I would assume you did not care for me at all.How long have you known?Why did you not tell me?But Edward loves you.He cannot marry her.No--but nor would I have him marry where he does not love.Always resignation and acceptance! Always prudence and honour and duty! Elinor, where is your heart?Oh, Elinor!There was no other way you said so yourself.I am stiff from sitting so long. Will you tell Charlotte that I am going for a stroll? ELINOR glances at the sky in concern.No, no, it will not rain.I will keep to the garden, near the house.Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove: 0, no! it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken...Willoughby... Willoughby...Who is that?Look, look, Elinor.It is Papa. Papa has come.Dearest Papa!Elinor?Where is Elinor?Colonel Brandon.Thank you.Shall we continue tomorrow?Away? Where?But you will not stay away long?There.There I fell, and there I first saw Willoughby.But does it follow that, had he chosen me, he would have been content?He would have had a wife he loved but no money--and might soon have learned to rank the demands of his pocket-book far above the demands of his heart.If his present regrets are half as painful as mine, he will suffer enough.No. I compare it with what it ought to have been. I compare it with yours.My illness has made me consider the past. I saw in my own behaviour nothing but imprudence--and worse. I was insolent and unjust to everyone----but you--you I wronged above all. Only I knew your heart and its sorrows but even then I was never a grain more compassionate. I brought my illness upon myself--I wanted to destroy myself. And had I succeeded, what misery should I have caused you?I shall mend my ways! I shall no longer worry others nor torture myself. I am determined to enter on a course of serious study---Colonel Brandon has promised me the run of his library and I shall read at least six hours a day. By the end of the year I expect to have improved my learning a very great deal.Did Mrs Ferrars seem well?It is not just for me! It is for all of us.Thank you, Edward, we are all very well.I hope you have left Mrs Ferrars well?What's happening now?", "clean_line": "fanny wishes know key silver cabinet kept presume wants count fortunate girl escape fanny able said yes good morning fanny silver genuine intolerable woman like view mr ferrars edward listen feel despair try mamma look arrived elinor approve rent fetch means edward amiable wanting sedate reading night love ardour soul satisfied polite concealed affections love burn passion adoration sacrifice like juliet guinevere heloise pathetic die love glorious know world convinced shall man truly love require young woman taste man sings dances admirably rides bravely reads passion tastes agree point love fancy feeling immortal immaculate truth tis blossom shed soon youth drops stem life grow barren regions waters flow ray promise cheats pensive gloom pity edward passion reading think amiable worthy shall unanswering devotion tell brother shall sure happy promise live far away love esteem like use insipid words shall leave room instant love fancy feeling ferrars attempt deny think highly greatly esteem like wager fortnight margaret know perfectly person sir john play pianoforte right right parade ignorant assumptions told point speak things strangers mrs jennings know duets forgive colonel oh moment peace rent low think hard terms ridiculous man safe wit age infirmity protect hear complain rheumatism shoulder taking walk need going rain felicity world superior look blue sky let chase help margaret run home fetch help ankle alarmed mamma mr john willoughby allenham lifted weighed dried leaf spirit wit feeling come tomorrow care colds man right help elinor know mr willoughby sir john like tastes passions pursuits thank colonel intention setting cap sir john goodbye colonel thank flowers beautiful hothouse preferred wild flowers doubt fixed mark goodbye thank suppose erred decorum dull spiritless talked weather state roads doubt hide regard time determine intimacy seven years insufficient people acquainted seven days feel know mr willoughby weaker shallow feelings conceal sorry elinor meani understand mamma mention edward seen norland true impropriety behaviour sensible elinor impertinent remarks mrs jennings proof impropriety offending moment lives delighted join colonel colonel invited delaford willoughby broadwood grand shall able play people bear party pleasure think wrote letter trick getting exactly willoughby course shall ask mamma stay church ask questions let like winter hath absence thee pleasure fleeting year freezings felt dark days seen old december bareness london grateful life mrs jennings kind woman like oh elinor shall willoughby think surprised edward asleep believe feel calm look elinor sleep tonight oh miss steele whispering long yes right oh elinor willoughby oh excuse colonel dear edward john expect daily messages pigeon message cards sleep course thought thank mrs jennings willoughby good god willoughby shake hands willoughby matter come london received letters heaven sake willoughby tell wrong willoughby elinor force come ask questions reproach confide tell conceal communicate dear madam loss discover point unfortunate offend esteem family given rise belief felt meant express shall reproach having guarded affections long engaged great regret return letters lock hair obligingly bestowed john willoughby engaged unworthy think yes absolutely day implied declared thought broken vow loved loved believe nature capable cruelty heart oh mamma want mamma elinor home tomorrow hire carriage wants gossip likes supply oh god endure stay course edward heard voice oh think elinor sight pleasure afforded elinor taken long come engaged friends met edward fearful giving pain incapable selfish saw edward sit elinor help persuade arrived urge stay reason doubt coldness edward assume care long known tell edward loves marry marry love resignation acceptance prudence honour duty elinor heart oh elinor way said stiff sitting long tell charlotte going stroll elinor glances sky concern rain garden near house love love alters alteration finds bends remover remove fixed mark looks tempests shaken willoughby willoughby look look elinor papa papa come dearest papa elinor elinor colonel brandon thank shall continue tomorrow away stay away long fell saw willoughby follow chosen content wife loved money soon learned rank demands pocket book far demands heart present regrets half painful suffer compare ought compare illness consider past saw behaviour imprudence worse insolent unjust wronged knew heart sorrows grain compassionate brought illness wanted destroy succeeded misery caused shall mend ways shall longer worry torture determined enter course study colonel brandon promised run library shall read hours day end year expect improved learning great deal mrs ferrars thank edward hope left mrs ferrars happening"}}}
