{"Jennifers-Body": {"NEEDY": {"raw_line": "Grassy-ass, Raymundo.I'm sorry I didn't do it sooner.I like Toastems.I'D RECOMMEND THAT YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP!This is where it all went down. \"Devil's Kettle\" sounds twisted, I know, but the place just is named after a dumb waterfall.You'll throw me a bone, huh? Huh? You killed Chip! You goddamned monster! You...ZOMBITCH!Know what this is for? Cutting boxes. She takes a swipe at Jennifer's CROTCH. Jennifer instinctively CLUTCHES herself and rears up in defense. We see Jennifer's mouth come down on Needy's neck. Needy shrieks as if BITTEN, but continues to strangle Jennifer, straddling her and bearing down.Is she dead, Mrs. Check? Did I get her?Hi, Roman! How's the Force treating you? I like that jaunty cap. Blue like your balls.Everything's going to be okay now. I rule.Hey. Didn't you used to baby-sit me in like 1998? When my mom worked the overnight at Hormel? The female cop fidgets uncomfortably.Yeah. Gracie, right? Gracie. I really like your hair, Gracie. How many cans of Salon Selectives did it take to erect that monument? The cop reaches into the backseat and SLAPS Needy, who hiccups with laughter.Watch it, Puffy Combs. That's police brutality!Ugh, don't say attempted. That sounds so JV. Small time. Teeny- weeny, just like Officer Duda up there. And trust me-- I'd know. Roman swallows nervously, eyes on the road. Officer Warzak glances at him.Let's get our facts straight: I successfully committed a hard core, fully premeditated murder back there. I fucking destroyed that brat, OK? I, Needy Lesnicki, put a stop-payment on Jennifer Check. She slumps down in the backseat.Why am I even in these cuffs? I just saved every guy in this town from becoming Satan Chow. I'm a hero.Confessions are for pussies. You've got a declaration, Grace. She giggles maniacally. Roman turns on the radio, violating protocol. It's a soaring rock anthem-- the SAME SONG we heard being piped into solitary confinement.What? She's my best friend. The geeky girl mockingly imitates Needy's excited wave.Are you jealous?She's not rich.What's up, Vagisil?Tonight? Why?What's Soft Shoulder?It's Thursday.I have to study. Jennifer pouts. With an outstretched finger, she draws a dramatic X in the air over Needy and boos loudly.Fine. What time is the show?He seems nice.Okay.Chip, it's a rock show. This is my rock look.Jennifer needs me. She really wants to go see this band. It's extremely important to her.The lead singer, of course. Girls like her don't go out with drummers.No offense. I mean, she'd probably make an exception for a drummer who was also the lead singer.Who's Phil Collins?Anyway, this singer guy is like 22, so he could get locked up in the state pen if he actually dated her. But Jennifer says he's extra salty, so...\"Salty\" means beautiful.Jennifer's here.(straightening herShe's my best friend, Chip. Remember? This necklace is no joke. CHIP sighs, resigned. They head downstairs.Wow.I think she remembered two buttons.You're gross!I don't think so.Hey, it's Ahmet from India. The foreign exchange guy. He's all by himself.He seems okay. He's got that cool elephant statue in his locker.Ew! ROMAN DUDA saunters up to Jennifer, swigging a bottle of beer. He snatches the pack of cigarettes away from her.Look, there's the band!They look so-- so cool. She gazes at the stage, hearing only the whistling rush of ARCTIC AIR. In SLOW MOTION, the GUITARIST unsheathes his Fender Jaguar from its gig bag. He notices her staring and runs the tip of his tongue over his lips. Needy swallows hard.No!Hey, if you don't mind me asking, why did you want to play all the way out here in Devil's Kettle? You live in the city, right?Those guys are rank, Jen. Just forget about it.Only because he thinks you're a virgin. I heard them talking.Oh my God.He's way too old for you.I know where to go! Needy grabs Jennifer by the elbow and pulls her into the tiny BATHROOM. Choking on smoke, they climb onto the Sticker Toilet and boost each other out the BATHROOM WINDOW. Hundreds are still trapped inside, screaming.You're okay, I promise. You got burned worse when you wore that tin-foil bikini to the beach. Everything's fine. Suddenly, a HAND clamps onto Jennifer's shoulder. Both girls jump. It's Nikolai, his forehead creased with false concern.We're great. Maybe you should try to find your band?Aren't you a little freaked out about this? What about all your stuff? It's probably melting, and when you get to the next stop you'll have to do like, a crappy acoustic set! Nobody likes that.Why? Why should we? We have the Malibu. Let's just get out of here. We can go to El Ojo and get Northwoods Nachos with extra Badger Sauce! Please? I'm starving.Thank God you're there. I hoped you were sleeping with your phone.Jennifer's gone. She ran off with that rock band. And the Carousel burned down. CHIP sits bolt uprightNo. I think they're mostly dead.We went out the bathroom window. Everyone else was trying to use the door. It was like a stampede. The people who fainted got run over and you could hear their bones breaking.There was all this screaming and popping, like a million Black Cats all going off at once. And the smell...No! Anyway, it took me like an hour to walk home. But Jennifer's still with those creeps! They had one of those white molester vans with no windows. The back was all blacked out.Oh cheese and fries! Someone's here. I'm alone, Chip. I'm freaked out!Swing shift. Listen, I'll call you in a minute. Stay awake.Um, Jennifer? Jennifer says nothing and continues to smile with blood- tinged teeth.What happened? Utter silence. Then a dripping sound. Needy looks down and sees large drops of blood spattering the linoleum. Jennifer continues to smile, staring directly at Needy.J-Jen?Jennifer! But she's long gone.You-- you're all right!Last night. At my house. You were hurt. You had two black eyes and blood everywhere and...We had to go out that window. The bar was like, engulfed in flames!A lot of people died, Jennifer. They burned to death, or they choked, or they just got trampled. More than half of the people there didn't make it out. It's like, all over the news. National news. Kids are dead. Parents are dead.We know everyone!I don't get it. What's wrong with you? Jennifer applies lip gloss and smacks her lips together.There's no way I dreamed it. No way.Work, you...twat! Swiff, darn it! Swiff! Swiff!Shoot.No anything today.I feel guilty just breathing.Chip, I need to tell you something kind of weird. It's about Jennifer.You know last night when we were talking and someone came to my door? That was Jennifer. But she didn't talk. She just stood there, smiling at me, but a bad kind of smile. She looked like she'd been beat up or shot or something. She was all bloody.And then she barfed up this disgusting prickly stuff that was like roadkill and sewing needles all mixed together. She shudders at the memoryYeah, like almost that bad! CHIP and Needy ponder the grotesque image in silence.No. It was something evil.Chip, I'm a National Merit Scholar. I don't tell whoppers and I'm not crazy.Discombobulated?Oh. Hi, Colin.Uh-huh.Thanks.I just am. We have Composition together. He's a really good writer. You know-- he's so dark and emotional and all.Walk me home?That's the thing, it's not a blur at all! I remember everything, in like ultra-high-def detail. The band, the fire, everything. Especially what happened after.Please, I need someone to believe me. Jennifer was-- she was destroyed. She was dying in my hallway, Chip. I saw. I used my CPR training to check her pulse. And I felt her dying, on the inside, I mean. I've known her so long that it's like sometimes I can feel what she feels. We're like E.T. and Elliot Ness.Thanks, Chipper.Fried bologna is the bomb! You want some, Greedo? She tuns on the kitchen radio and is surprised to hear a very familiar song: \"Through the Trees,\" by Soft Shoulder. Suddenly, she pauses, a look of UNEASE and even FEAR crossing her face. She stops and braces herself against the counter, her KNEES SHAKING. Something isn't right. She drops the sandwich. Greedo goes straight for it.Something's wrong... As Needy sinks to her knees, she stares straight ahead at the REFRIGERATOR. A photo magnet of JENNIFER leers back at her.Crap! Needy's mom, ANTONIA \"TONI\" LESNICKI, has quietly entered the kitchen in her pajamas. She's pale and sweaty, as if she's been spooked.Oh, hi, Mom. I didn't know you were awake.It's four o' clock, so technically you had a day terror.What did you dream about?Yes you are.You know, I can take care of myself, Mom.Hey Mom? Did you get a chance to catch the news after you clocked out this morning?Nothing. Forget it.Yes ma'am. Toni shakes her head and heads upstairs.Needy speaking. CROSS CUT PHONE CALL:Good for you.Yeah.Lucky you. See, I'm still kind of depressed about, you know, the giant smoldering funeral pyre in the middle of town?That's really nice.Jesus didn't invent the calendar.That's my other line.It'll just be a second.I can barely hear you.Fifteen. Back on JENNIFER: Jennifer is impatiently dragging a razor down her arm. Blood drips onto the rug. She smiles, in awe of herself.I have to go.I have to meet Chip at McCullum Park.I gotta go.Why are the cops at your house?What?! Like, he was shot by gangbangers?Some animals must've got to him.Who would do that?This can't be a coincidence.A fiery death trap last night, and now a cannibal eats our starting tight-end? Come on!Seriously Chip. Most small towns only have something gruesome happen like, once every decade maybe. Devil's Kettle gets two nightmares in 24 hours? It's freaktarded. It's not right.I don't know. I'm extremely intelligent but I obviously don't know everything.You're shaking.Want my sweater?Pink is cool. Rap guys wear pink. She's shaking now, too. Chip leans forward and kisses her. She closes her eyes. In the chaste space between CHIP and Needy's bodies, the volleyball-pit couple fuck like rabbits. DISSOLVE TO:Are you okay?Are you PMS-ing or something?Oh. Mr. Wroblewski clears his throat, annoyed by their talking.What about the other 97%?The other 97%. I mean, that's just crass. Right? She looks around for support, finding none.Crass. It means scummy. Greedy. Am I the only one who actually does the vocab drills?No, they're not. I was there, Chastity. They didn't actually help anyone escape the fire. I don't even know how that rumor got started.Oh, that's crap...I'm already sick of that song.No offense, but you look kind of drained. Is everything all right?What's wearing off? Are you on pot?That was random.Colin's a really nice guy.No. He was just asking Jennifer out on a date. Chip looks relieved.Sure. I'd like that.Thanks.I didn't assume that.Mmm.No, this is nice.\"Sensual Swirl?\"Oh. Cool.Oh. It's got little bumps on it. I can hardly wait.Hopeless..hopeless... CHIP opens his eyes.It's her.I have to go. I'm sorry. I just... feel like something...something terrible...I'm so sorry, Chip. I'm so sorry. Everything is just wrong. She bolts out the room, leaving Chip naked and alone. He pulls his knees up to his chest, vulnerable.Fudge! Fudge! Maple fudge!Mommy! Mommy? Please be home!I never tell on you.Get out!What the fuck is happening?I saw you! I saw you! The car...the...I...I'm calling the police.What do you want?Yeah, it rings a bell.What did they do to you?They...killed you.Maybe it did.I remember.What do you mean, \"when you're full\"?What about my mom's Kia? Why did you attack me out there? Why were you covered in blood? You didn't even look human. Jennifer rolls her eyes.Leave!What are you doing?I gotta show you something.Not here. Behind the school.Evidence.Yes, but I promise you this is the last thing I need to show y--Please just let me show you. Her gaze is so intense and crazed that Chip has no option but to submit. He nods reluctantly.Look at this. She thrusts a piece of paper into CHIP's hands.Demonic transference. It's something that happens when you try to sacrifice a virgin to Satan without using an actual virgin! CHIP stares at her.I think that's what happened to Jennifer. Those guys from that band were trying to sacrifice her in the woods. But what they didn't realize is that she hasn't been a virgin since junior high! Jennifer's a total cum-dumpster! It all makes sense now! Read this... She grabs the piece of paper from him.\"If the human sacrifice is impure, the result may still be attained, but a demon will forever reside the soul of the victim. She must forever feed on flesh to sustain the demon.\" See? CHIP looks more dubious than ever.She's eating boys! They make her strong. Really strong. And when she's hungry, she gets weak and cranky and her hair is all full of split ends. And look at this... She holds up one of the printouts.It says that before the demon feeds, it vomits a gruesome substance on its prey. Like I saw!And possibly Ahmet from India.No. No! Of course not!No...Listen, I'll make an appointment with Mr. Feely. I'm real sorry about this sudden onset of teenage paranoia. My hormones and emotions are aswirl, and my moods are erratic... CHIP isn't totally convinced, but his face softens.This has been a crummy school year, Chip.Listen, I'm done with all that devil stuff. Do you know what you're wearing to Turnabout?I don't know yet.Oh yeah, your mom's an Avon lady.Right. Well, I'll try to find something magenta.I look pork stupid.Who's Cindy Crawford?Ow! You're too close to my neck.Gross, Mom. Chip isn't that ostentatious.What are you doing to my hair?Aw, jeez Mom!Chip!Well, hi there Camille! Is Chipper home?Where's Chip?He walked? Mrs. Dove, you mean to only tell me that in these dangerous, godless times-- you let your only son walk alone at night?Which way did he go?Chip! A terrified SCREAM in the distance. Needy whips around, hikes up her skirt and starts running toward Murphy Pool.I'm coming! She flings herself over the top of the fence, her body slamming against the concrete pool deck. Her ARM snaps. It's a compound fracture, the bone thrusting through the flesh of her arm as she screams.Holy crap!Saint Jude, patron saint of hopeless causes: Please give me the power to crush this bitch. Jennifer looks up with demonic, bloodshot eyes just as Needy leaps off the diving board. Needy lands on Jennifer's shoulders, taking her out. She wraps her legs around Jennifer's neck and drags her under the water. Jennifer emerges. Needy grabs her by the hair and girly- slaps her furiously across the face. Then she spots the PEPPER SPRAY lying by the side of the pool. She grabs it and sprays it in Jennifer's eyes. Jennifer shrieks and vomits NASTY, SPINY GORE all over Needy and Chip.She's just hovering, CHIP. It's not that impressive. Jennifer speaks in a metallic, demonic-sounding voice.You're a jerk.You know what? You were never a good friend. Ever. Even when we were little. You used to steal my toys and pour lemonade on my bed and make me be Ugly Ashley when we played Barbies!Why do you need him? Huh? She begins to weep.Why do you need the one guy who's ever liked me? You can have anyone, Jennifer!The cutest guy in school. The mailman. A teacher. You could probably even have a huge star like Chad Michael Murray. So why Chip? Why him? Is it just to piss me off? Or is it because you're insecure?Yeah, two years ago. When you were socially relevant.You were skinny then, too! A look of ABJECT HORROR on Jennifer's face. She reels back against the chain link fence, her eyes blazing.I thought you only murdered boys.We hurt you...Where are you going?Why give up now? He's almost dead! Get your bulimic ass back here and kill us both!Oh, Chip!I'm gonna call for help.I think 911 is always a free call.It's not working. It's full of Jennifer-goo.No! You're not going anywhere!I love you.You're clearly delirious.I'm never leaving.No! Chip's eyes close. His face relaxes. He's gone. Needy wails at the top of her lungs. She rests her head against his mutilated chest, oblivious to the blood and bone.Just watching your old man try to suck the ugly off your face.Did you know the original Goths were a Germanic tribe that settled in Rome? They didn't wear black. They wore regular linen tunics. I don't know why nobody else knows that.You didn't play your hit yet. But they're gone. Needy looks out at her classmates. They stare back. She PASSES OUT COLD.Trouble was, some of us would never wake up.She left an insanely hot corpse.\"Through the trees, I will find you. Heal the ruins left inside you...\"\"...We'll meet again.\" A small creek emptying into a stream runs parallel to the road. Needy seems something glinting at the mouth of the creek and stoops to pick it up. It's Nikolai's BOWIE KNIFE, the one he threw into Devil's Kettle, never to be seen again. Needy picks it up and tucks it into her waistband. A STATION WAGON comes rattling up the road. Needy sticks her thumb out again. The wagon pulls over to the side of the road. The driver, a grizzled older man, rolls down the window. He eyes Needy lasciviously.East, toward Madison.I don't have any money or drugs, so you'll have to settle for ass.I'm following this rock band.Tonight's gonna be their last show.", "clean_line":

Needy PLUNGES through the window, screaming and brandishing a HAMMER. She takes a SWING at Jennifer's head, but misses and BURIES IT IN THE WALL, specifically in Jennifer's Fall Out Boy poster. Needy throws herself on top of Jennifer. She STRADDLES Jennifer and grips her throat, throttling her.Do you buy all your murder weapons at Home Depot? God, you're butch.My tit! Suddenly, the room is flooded with BRIGHT LIGHT, revealing a Needy straddling Jennifer's MUTLIATED BODY. Jennifer's breathing is a raspy death rattle. MRS. CHECK, a middle-aged woman in bad sleepwear and a worse perm rushes into the bedroom.Hey, Monistat.You and me are going out tonight.Soft Shoulder are playing at the Carousel.And it's all-ages, for once, which means I won't have to play Hello Titty with the door guy.They're this indie band from the city. I saw their MySpace and the singer is extra salty. And there will be lots of other salty morsels there for you. Come on Needy, it's the weekend!Thursday counts as the weekend in college. And we're going to be in college twenty-three months from now. University of Northern Minnesota Duluth- woo! Needy continues loading her backpack.Please, please you're a social disease?Boo! Cross out Needy!I'll pick you up at 8:30. My mom has a date with that guy who owns the ham store.Yeah, Mom says he's got a huge... heart. So huge he gave her a recurring bladder infection. Wear something cool, okay?Needy, quit tampooning yourself and get down here!Guess who's got the whip `til 11:30? A 2003 Chrysler Sebring and it's all mine.You're lucky you get to ride with me to the club in style! She does a sexy little dance in the doorway, then notices CHIP.Oh, hi Chip. Do you like puppies? She grabs her boobs and thrusts her chest outward at him, giggling. Needy watches jealously and MANEUVERS HER WAYIt smells like Thai food in here. Have you guys been fucking?Okay, let's go to the club. The three of them shuffle onto the porch. Needy locks the door.Eat my ass, Chip. You're just jello `cause you're not invited.You're totally jello! You're lime green jello and you can't even admit it. The girls scamper toward the car.God, I can't wait until I'm old enough to get wasted. Have you ever had peach schnapps?Peach schnapps are excellent. They even taste good when they come out of your nose mid-puke. A teenage guy, CRAIG, passes by and waves.What up, Craig. She elbows Needy and makes a GAGGING GESTURE.He thinks he's cute enough for me. No wonder he's in retard math. Jennifer pulls out a pack of Camel Wides and lights one awkwardly. Needy notices AHMET FROM INDIA, a FOREIGN EXCHANGE STUDENT, standing by himself away from the crowd.I can't believe we traded a cute hockey player for that.Do you think he's circumcised? I always wanted to try sea cucumber.What? I like the Wides.Arrest me, pfft! You're not even out of the academy yet, Roman!How will I wait that long? She paws Roman's crotch discreetly. Needy winces.You can tell they're from the city.You would think that. You're such a small-time Gomer. I wish we had more guys like that in Devil's Kettle. All stylish and shit. Needy nods dumbly. She stares at the band, awestruck.Hey, I think they need two groupies. Come on! It'll be like Almost Famous! I'll be Penny Lane and you can be the other girl. She grabs Needy's hand and enthusiastically tries to drag her toward the stage.Don't be J.V., Needy. They're just boys. Morsels. We have all the power, don't you know that? She plants her hands on Needy's CHEST.These things are like smart bombs. Point `em in the right direction and shit gets real.Hi. Um, we just really wanted to meet you or something? I'm Jennifer Check and this is my friend.Yeah! Soft Shoulder, right? I've heard you guys are super, super good at playing your instruments.Can I show you my appreciation right now? Needy looks at the floor, embarrassed.Like, I'll buy you a drink? I mean, I'll see if I can get you a drink. They make this great 9/11 tribute shooter? It's red, white and blue, but you have to drink it fast or it gets all brownish.What? Are you scared of rock stars too?I think the singer wants me.Yeah, right! I'm not even a backdoor-virgin anymore, thanks to Roman. By the way, that hurts. I couldn't even go to flags the next day. I had to stay home and sit on a bag of frozen peas.Well, if Nikolai wants innocent, I can do innocent. I'll be Little Miss Fucking Sunshine.Don't cock-block me, Needy.It's so hot, Needy. I think I'm on fire. Oh God, I'm burning!Okay...okay... She slumps against Nikolai's chest.I want to see your van. C'mon Needy, let's go to the van.Needy, stop it. Just stop it! She defiantly follows Nikolai toward the WHITE VAN, which is parked a suspiciously safe distance from the bar. Needy staggers after them slowly, watching. Behind Needy, the bar EXPLODES. Screams. Flames. Silence. Needy doesn't even look back as she watches Jennifer get into the van. Ash drifts into her hair like snowflakes.Are you scared? Needy nods. Jennifer parts her lips. Then suddenly, she stops and PULLS AWAY, pushing Needy to the floor. Jennifer bolts out the front door and takes off running down the street. Needy is motionless for a moment, then stumbles toward the doorway.Happy Friday!, D-bag!Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?Needy, you're delusional. I got a little banged up when you made me go out that window, but I'm fine.You do have a tendency to overreact. Remember at Girl Scout camp when you thought there was an earthquake and it was really just two guys with a ghetto blaster?Anyone we know?Sucks to be them, I guess. She giggles and reaches for her knockoff designer purse.What's wrong with you? I mean, besides the obvious surface flaws.Don't talk to yourself. It's one of your more freakish Needy behaviors and it makes us both look like total gaylords. Needy raises her hands desperately to Jennifer, spreading her fingers to display her filthy fingernails.Eww, you need a mani bad. You'd better find a Chinese chick to buff your situation!Here comes Handi-Snack.No way! Parrish ate shit?Oh look, they're united in grief. That'll last.Hi!I'm crazy-sorry about your profound loss. You are crying about Craig, right?I know. I was close to him too. You know, I was there last night in that horrible place. I saw Craig a few minutes before the fire broke out.Yeah. I was probably the last person to talk to him. Like, ever. Literally.Well, we got to talking about you, actually. And do you know what he said? He said you were like a brother to him. Not a bro. An actual brother.I know, I know. Hey, you know what else Craig said?Forget it. It's too intense.Well, he said he always thought you and me would make a totally bangin' couple. Isn't that so weird?Feel my heart, Jonas. I think it's broken.Come with me. Just for a while. We'll help each other get through this nightmare. It's what Craig would have wanted. Jonas nods dumbly, brainwashed. Jennifer leads him away from the field, toward the WOODS bordering the school campus. They vanish into the woods. In the distance, we see the FALLS rushing into the lake.(firmly covering hisWhat?Mm-hmm. They're waiting.Do you miss Craig?Don't worry. You're going to see your buddy again.No. She smiles and shakes her head. Jonas jerks back, creeped out. He tries to pull away from Jennifer, but she's too strong. She PINS him to the tree. We see her jaw begin to UNHINGE, like some horrible snake. Her eyes cloud over with blood...I feel sooo scrumptious! She picks up a Soft Shoulder button and POKES her arm hard with the pin without flinching. Blood spurts from the wound.You know, like when you kiss a hot guy for the first time and your whole body feels like it's on vibrate.It's that good. Jennifer gazes at her arm, transfixed. She wipes the blood away-- the wound has magically DISAPPEARED.Move-on dot org, Needy! It's over. Life's too short to mope over some white-trash pig roast. She flicks a Zippo lighter and touches the FLAME to her tongue-- first tentatively, then confidently.I tell it like it is. Besides, you should be happy for me. I'm having the best day since, like Jesus invented the calendar.So blow it off.Pooh. I'm crossing you out. She draws a mini-X in the air. Needy clicks over. It's CHIP. We get a nice trifold pie- chart illustrating the intersecting calls. CHIP is panicked and sweaty in his living room. In the background, Chip's little sister CAMILLE bangs on a piano. Red police lights flash outside the picture window.What could possibly be more important than me and my godlike powers?Chip is looking cute to me lately. So tell me, is he packing some serious pubic inches? What's the story down there?Bo-ring!No. I feel like boo-boo. My skin is breaking out. My hair is dull and lifeless. God, it's like I'm one of the normal girls! Needy smooths her own hair self-consciously.PMS isn't real, Needy. It was invented by the boy-run media to make us seem crazy.Yeah. It's poorly produced. Could the bass be any lower in the mix?I'm fine. It's just, like, wearing off or something.No, dick ridge! Just forget I said anything. COLIN GRAY, the punk/goth boy we met earlier, approaches Jennifer nervously as she exits the classroom. Needy drops behind them, eavesdropping.Oh, hey Colin. Listen, can I copy your bio lab again? I never got around to dissecting that kitten fetus.Oh. You want to know if I'll go out with you.Just go ahead with the pitch. Colin fidgets awkwardly.I don't like boxing movies.Wait! Colin turns around.Why don't you just come by my place tonight? I just got Aquamarine on DVD. It's about this girl who's like, half-sushi. I guess she has sex through her blowhole or something.I'll text you my address. Colin walks away, grinning triumphantly.I'm used to guys asking me out.He's into maggot-rock. He wears nail polish.Hi Chip. Needy puts her arm around Chip protectively.I gotta go parlez French. Slam you later.You made it.No baby. This is our house, just for you and me. We can play Mommy and Daddy. Colin is totally dumbstruck.Silly. I've been sending you signals all year. Couldn't you tell? You give me such a wettie.You scared? I thought boys like you were into vermin.Nice hardware, Ace.Oh, don't you dare pass out! I need you to be conscious.I need you frightened. Colin tries to jerk away, but Jennifer easily disengages his arm from its socket. A sickeningly moist SNAP. Colin cries out in pain.I need you hopeless. She slams him to the ground and mounts him. Her jaw unhinges, opening her mouth to a horrifying, inhuman degree. Her teeth are razor-sharp and grotesquely crowded, like they belong to some horribly deformed dog. She descends on him, feeding ravenously.God, enough screaming already. You're such a cliche.But we always share your bed when we have slumber parties. She winks conspiratorially at Needy.Whoa. I have never heard you drop the F-bomb before. What's buggin'?Buh-buh-buh. Slow down, tardy slip. You sound like a sped.Go ahead, narc me out. I've got the cops in my back pocket. I'm fucking a cadet, remember?I want to explain some things to you. You've already seen too much and besides-- best friends don't keep secrets. Right? Needy nods, terrified.Remember the night of the fire?Well, I got pretty messed up. I almost died. You know those guys in Soft Shoulder? Totally evil. They're basically agents of Satan with awesome haircuts. I figured that out as soon as I got into their molester van.Guys? Where are we going?Are you guys rapists?!Yes...yes! Of course I'm a virgin! I've never done sex ever. I don't even know how. So maybe you should find some other girl who does. Know how.Just let me finish. So they drove all the way out to the falls. I tried to figure out an escape, but it was so dark out there...My name is Jennifer.Please let me go. I'll do anything. Anything you want.Maybe you could just hire a publicist. Make some T-shirts or something. Hey, I could be on your street team!Please...Being tortured would make most girls black out or something. But I'm so hard core, I was with them the whole time. I could feel them gutting me Under my ribs, up into my belly, then right through my heart.I'm here, aren't I? She shakes her head, annoyed with Needy.I mean, yeah. They went Benihana on my ass. It should have killed me. But for some reason, it didn't.Whatever. Anyway, I don't really remember what happened after that. I just-- woke up a few hours later and found my way back, somehow.I couldn't bring myself to hurt you. I mean, I'm a really good friend. But I felt so hungry. I had to do something.Ahmet. You made it out.Are you lost?Does your host family know you're alive?Does anyone know you're alive?Come with me. We'll sort this out.Ever since then, I just somehow knew what I needed to do to be strong. And when I'm full--like I am right now--I'm like, immortal! I can do stuff like this. Jennifer jams the CUTICLE STICK into her own forearm and drags it through her flesh. Needy screams and covers her mouth.No biggie. Watch. She pulls out the stick. The wound seals over instantly. Needy gasps and touches Jennifer's unmarked arm.That's some X-Men shit, right?You know. Full. Like full of tasty morsels. Needy shakes her head, not comprehending.Forget it. You'd probably tell on me anyway. Not that anyone would believe you. You always think the world is coming to an end.You should talk to someone about these disturbing thoughts you're having. We're all concerned. Especially Chip. I think he's having second thoughts about you.My, aren't we a C-U-Next-Tuesday?You said to leave. So I'm outtie-See you at school. She LEAPS gracefully out the window. Needy watches in stunned silence for a few moments. Then she creeps over to the window and looks out. Nothing there but the wind. Jennifer's gone.Didn't you hear me calling your name?Yes, I was.I think you were maybe spacing out. You were like this: Derrrrr. She mimics a blank, drooling expression.Yes, exactly like that. Listen, I need to talk to you about you-know- who. Our little Needy.Are you worried? `Cause I'm super- stressed about her. God knows how I even sleep at night.I think I know what's wrong with her. In fact, I know I know what's wrong with her.I feel bad telling you this. Okay, you know Needy's been a total Lithium candidate since the night Colin Gray died. But that's not just because he was brutally murdered and stuff. It's because....I don't wanna say this.Needy and Colin were intimate. By that I mean he was poking her donut on a semi-regular basis.I know this must be hard for you to hear.That's what she wants you to believe. But trust me, her and Colin were doing stuff you haven't even heard of. Total varsity moves.Well, apparently he had a thing for me-- no surprise there. And I figured Needy was busy jumping your jock that night, so I agreed to a little pity date. Colin brought me to that empty house so we could have some privacy. But he wanted to go too far, so I left after a few minutes. Next thing I knew, they'd found... She sniffles, wiping her eye....what was left of him.Huh?I'm sorry you had to hear this from me. I'm just so worried about Needy. She's losing her shit. Colin was her everything.I wouldn't be surprised if she winds up in the nuthouse.Well, you've been talking to her more than I have. How bad is it?I can only imagine the paranoid theories she's come up with.I just can't believe she would do this to you. I care so much about you, Chip.More than I've ever had the guts to admit.Needy didn't deserve a boy like you.Ooh, you're so salty!Say it like you mean it.Say I'm better than Needy.We really shouldn't be doing this. She pulls away from him, feigning a guilty conscience.Natch. She resumes kissing him enthusiastically.I have just the place.You're in big trouble anyway. Come on.Never, Trevor. I'm hot like magma. She prances over to the abandoned pool and begins to climb down the ladder on the side. The pool is full of filthy, freezing water.Swimming.Come on in, Chip. Show me your breast stroke.It's not so bad.I'm sorry. I was just trying to make you laugh. I think now, more than ever, we need laughter. We've both lost a close friend. CHIP nods sadly.I feel so empty.Please come here and kiss me again. Make all this madness go away. Chip tiptoes forward tentatively and sinks to his knees. He leans in and kisses Jennifer, who's still clinging to the ladder. The sound of buzzing flies grows louder. Suddenly, Jennifer opens her eyes. She hooks her arm around Chip's neck and lunges backward. They tumble off the ladder, into the pool. Chip SCREAMS.Fuck this J.V. shit! Jennifer ROCKETS straight up into the air like a goddess, hovering ten feet above the pool. Her eyes burn. Her skin is corpselike. She's drenched from head to toe in the prickly ooze.God, do you have to undermine everything I do? You're such a player-hater.Nice insult, Lizzie McGuire. Got any more harsh digs?And now I'm eating your boyfriend! See? At least I'm consistent.I am not insecure. God, what a joke! How could I be insecure? I was the Snowflake Queen!I AM STILL SOCIALLY RELEVANT!I'm gonna eat your soul and shit it out, Lesnicki. Her voice is now an unearthly growl. In the background, Chip is slowly, painfully pulling a POOL SKIMMER with an eight-foot handle off the pool deck.I go both ways. She HURTLES herself toward Needy, roaring, her eyes white- hot, her jaws agape. She's monstrous. Chip suddenly stumbles in front of Needy and holds the HANDLE of the POOL SKIMMER in front of them like a spear. As Jennifer flies forward at demonic speed, she IMPALES HER ENTIRE TORSO on the handle. Needy screams. There's a beat of deafening silence.Ow-Ow-Ow. Needy watches, and realizes Jennifer is injured. Blood drips onto the pool deck.Got a tampon? Needy shakes her head mutely.Thought I'd ask. You seemed like you might be pluggin'.Fuck this noise. I'm out. You losers are more trouble then you're worth. She continues climbing.Nah. I mean, you say I've been a bad friend all these years. I might as well throw you a bone.", "clean_line": "huh needy plunges window screaming brandishing hammer takes swing jennifer head misses buries wall specifically jennifer fall boy poster needy throws

are hella low. I can almost see your front butt.I can see, like, your womb. Needy sighs and hoists up her pants.Why are you blowing me off for some dumb concert, anyway? We were supposed to have Movie Night. I even rented Orca. It's like Jaws, except with a harmless whale.I've never even heard of Soft Shoulder. Which one is Jennifer stalking?Thanks a lot!Like Phil Collins.Forget it. He's seminal, but whatever...Salty. You guys ever going to stop using that secret language?Then you must be soy sauce, babe. Needy and CHIP start MAKING OUT. CHIP unbuckles his belt eagerly even though they've barely begun. Needy stops.How do you know? Needy shrugs. A beat of silence. Then we hear the door swing open. JENNIFER'S VOICE floats up from downstairs.That's fucking weird.You always do what Jennifer tells you to do. Needy pulls her NECKLACE out from beneath her shirt and flashes a heart-shaped \"B.F.F.\" charm at Chip.The Carousel is not a club.I'm not jello! That place is gross. Everyone there has a mustache.Stop kidnapping my girlfriend!Hey, Niedermeyer.What's wrong?Like, burned down? To the ground? Is everyone okay?Shit. You're okay, right?This is real, right? This isn't just, like, some crazy dream like last time?Who cares about Jennifer and those douchebags with douchebag haircuts? People just burned to death. In our town!Where's your mom?Holla back. Needy hangs up the phone and rushes downstairs. As she passes through the shadowy kitchen, appliances HUM all around her. The silence is menacing.No band practice today.It's surreal, right? I mean, when just one guy dies in Devil's Kettle, it's like time stops. And now so many people are dead, nobody knows when it's okay to start again.Word.What?Yuck. Like those porcupine meatballs my mom makes with the rice sticking out?It was probably because she inhaled a whole bunch of smoke.You might want to talk to the school shrink, Needy. I'm not saying that to be a dillhole. I'm actually kinda concerned.I didn't say you were crazy. It's just that everyone's a little messed up about this. It's okay to feel...Yeah, you know. Fucked up. As they prepare to leave, COLIN GRAY approaches Needy. He's a cute PUNK/GOTH guy wearing black nail polish, a lip ring, and full wardrobe by Hot Topic.How are you friends with Colin Gray? I thought Colin Gray only talked to the Dead Girls. We see a group of GOTH GIRLS splayed against their lockers in full regalia. One wears an ACCORDION for no reason.Oh. I can relate. I'm also like that, even if I'm not all obvious about it like a poseur.You know it.The whole night must be a total blur, right?\"After\" is the part I don't really get, to be honest.I believe you. Chip takes Needy's hand and squeezes it.I need to see you right now.Camille is playing piano. Knock it off, Camille!Can you meet me at McCullum in ten?They're not. They're at Jonas Kozelle's house. He got murdered.No, Needy! Do you see anyone rollin' on dubs around here? Someone ripped Jonas limb from limb in the woods behind the school. Ate parts of him. They found teethmarks on him-- on the body. His voice cracks. We see a brief, terrifying FLASH of Jonas's mutilated body and pain-stricken face. Needy doesn't want to believe it.Human teethmarks.I don't know. It just happened after school. No one's supposed to know yet, but my dad went over there and talked to the cops. Jonas's mom is catatonic. She's just staring out the front window like a zombie mannequin robot statue.What do you mean, Needy?Don't get spooky on me, babe.What, do you think it's, like supernatural?Well, the bad luck's gotta be over now, right? It can't get any worse, right? Obviously it can't. It can't. I mean, you agree, right? There won't be another victim.I'm cold. It's very cold out here.It's pink.Hi.Talking to your good pal Colin Gray again?Can I come over tonight?I went to Super Target and bought more condoms.Not that that has anything to do with my coming over.Well, I'll see you tonight. Needy waves as Chip walks away.For ambiance. It's Jammin' Jasmine.My mom has Holiday Scents too, if you're interested.It's supposed to make it feel good for the girl.What? Am I hurting you? Needy starts weeping.Am I too big? Tears roll down Needy's cheeks. She begins moaning, then SCREAMING at that top of her lungs.Needy! What's wrong? Needy continues to shriek hysterically, her voice growing ragged.Is it something I did?Do you need more foreplay?Needy!You feel-- What does that even mean? I'm worried about you.Hey. Did you buy Turnabout tickets yet? I don't get paid until next week.What is it?What is it?Is this about Jennifer?Needy, I care about you. A lot. As a person, not just a girl I made love to for four minutes the other night. And I'm scared of what's happening to you. You're acting really fucked up.Demon...demonic...Uh-huh.You--you really think Jennifer killed Jonas and Colin?Really? You think she ate those guys?Is that what you think?It's all right, Needy.No shit. Needy turns and pitches the black binder into a Dumpster.I was thinking a suit with black shoes and a boutonniere, right here.What color dress are you gonna wear? I need to order your wrist corsage.How about magenta? You're definitely a winter. My mom says winters should wear regal jewel tones like magenta. Or possibly teal.Well, they call them \"sales reps\" now.That'll look dope.I'm in underpants, Mom! We hear the voice of CHIP'S MOM through the door.Hang on. Chip puts on a robe and opens the door.Ladies' pepper spray?I can take care of myself. I've been using the Bowflex. In the background, we can see the BOWFLEX with clothes hanging off it.Lasagna with teeth?Meeting her at the dance. I'm gonna walk. It's so warm outside. It's like 40.Yes, ma'am.You weren't calling my name.I couldn't hear it.I was?I know.She hasn't been the same for weeks.Then tell me.Say it!Needy's not like that.But you were with Colin the night he was killed.Eye-talian.Never mind.I just can't believe this.It's bad, man. It's bad.Oh, you have no idea.Yeah, you too.You're so salty. I need water. It burns. The salty burns my mouth.What? Why?You're better than Needy. Jennifer smiles, satisfied.This feels weird. Can we go somewhere else?Murphy Pool? I don't think we can go in there. I knew some skater guys who went in there. They got in big trouble and now they have to pick up garbage for 100 hours. Jennifer giggles and pulls him along.Aren't you cold?What are you doing?Ha ha.The water looks disgusting.Are you kidding? It's totally bubonic in there. I think I see a dead possum with a Doritos bag in its pouch. And that looks like a used syringe over there... He slaps away a FLY.I know.Me too.Needy!She can fly?Needy. You saved me.Oh no, I'm out of minutes!Oh yeah. You're right.Hey, I'm going somewhere...I'm toast, Needy. I'm definitely gonna die. I think I already died before you were here, but I woke up when I heard your voice.Yeah me too. And you look hot in that dress.No. When you're dying, you can see everything a lot clearer. You can see what's true and what's not. The things that are true have this glowing halo of light around them, like a picture of the Baby Jesus, or Barbara Walters when they use the special lens. And I know for sure that you're totally hot.You'd better get out of here. The police are going to come and I don't want them to, you know, make a mistake.But I have to go.", "clean_line": "jeans hella low butt like womb needy sighs hoists pants blowing dumb concert supposed movie night rented orca like jaws harmless whale ve heard soft shoulder jennifer stalking thanks lot like phil collins forget seminal salty guys going stop secret language soy sauce babe needy chip start making chip unbuckles belt eagerly ve barely begun needy stops know needy shrugs beat silence hear door swing open jennifer voice floats downstairs fucking weird jennifer tells needy pulls necklace beneath shirt flashes heart shaped charm chip carousel club jello place gross mustache stop kidnapping girlfriend hey niedermeyer wrong like burned ground okay shit okay right real right isn like crazy dream like time cares jennifer douchebags douchebag haircuts people burned death town mom holla needy hangs phone rushes downstairs passes shadowy kitchen appliances hum silence menacing band practice today surreal right mean guy dies devil kettle like time stops people dead knows okay start word yuck like porcupine meatballs mom makes rice sticking probably inhaled bunch smoke want talk school shrink needy saying dillhole actually kinda concerned crazy little messed okay feel yeah know fucked prepare leave colin gray approaches needy cute punk goth guy wearing black nail polish lip ring wardrobe hot topic friends colin gray thought colin gray talked dead girls group goth girls splayed lockers regalia wears accordion reason oh relate like obvious like poseur know night total blur right honest believe chip takes needy hand squeezes need right camille playing piano knock camille meet mccullum jonas kozelle house got murdered needy rollin dubs ripped jonas limb limb woods school ate parts teethmarks body voice cracks brief terrifying flash jonas mutilated body pain stricken face needy want believe human teethmarks know happened school supposed know dad went talked cops jonas mom catatonic staring window like zombie mannequin robot statue mean needy spooky babe think like supernatural bad luck gotta right worse right obviously mean agree right won victim cold cold pink hi talking good pal colin gray come tonight went super target bought condoms coming ll tonight needy waves chip walks away ambiance jammin jasmine mom holiday scents interested supposed feel good girl hurting needy starts weeping big tears roll needy cheeks begins moaning screaming lungs needy wrong needy continues shriek hysterically voice growing ragged need foreplay needy feel mean worried hey buy turnabout tickets paid week jennifer needy care lot person girl love minutes night scared happening acting fucked demon demonic uh huh think jennifer killed jonas colin think ate guys think right needy shit needy turns pitches black binder dumpster thinking suit black shoes boutonniere right color dress gonna wear need order wrist corsage magenta definitely winter mom says winters wear regal jewel tones like magenta possibly teal sales reps ll look dope underpants mom hear voice chip mom door hang chip puts robe opens door ladies pepper spray care ve bowflex background bowflex clothes hanging lasagna teeth meeting dance gonna walk warm outside like yes ma weren calling couldn hear know hasn weeks tell needy like colin night killed eye talian mind believe bad man bad oh idea yeah salty need water burns salty burns mouth better needy jennifer smiles satisfied feels weird murphy pool think knew skater guys went got big trouble pick garbage hours jennifer giggles pulls aren cold ha ha water looks disgusting kidding totally bubonic think dead possum doritos bag pouch looks like syringe slaps away fly know needy fly needy saved oh minutes oh yeah right hey going toast needy definitely gonna die think died woke heard voice yeah look hot dress dying lot clearer true things true glowing halo light like picture baby jesus barbara walters use special lens know sure totally hot better police going come want know mistake"}}}
