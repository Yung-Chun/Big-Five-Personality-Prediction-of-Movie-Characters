Unless you've changed your mind about coming?Well... whatever you'd like.Very well then. Good day, Miss Mercer.What did I think of it?I better read it. Steel workers tend to vote democratic. Next.Must I?Anything else?Who?I can handle my own affairs, Louis.You say that like it's a bad thing.And I have accepted.I am in love with Miss Mercer, Mama.Babs!For what?I didn't mean to hurt you, Babs.My trust fund.I humbly accept your nomination for Vice-President!They say the best way to get rid of a man is to have him run for Vice- President. You might well have asked my cousin Teddy if that's how they got rid of him!Cousin Alice, if Teddy were alive he'd be a democrat -- and you know it.And what's wrong with that?No, but I'm sure you'll tell me.Is that what you think?Alice, stop.What are you talking about?She's married?When I last heard she was governess to his children.Really? Of which state?What about Al Smith?Boy Scouts, Louis? Hardly my political base.Franklin Roosevelt, happy to meet you.Of course!What's your name, son?Guiseppe! Come sta, ragazzo?Festina lente!Up!

Where's the letter from Peabody?Why not miracle waters? I've drunk the oil of monkey glands, been zapped with electricity and hung upside down in harnesses.

Just your grandmama.I can do it.That's marvelous, Babs.You wonder why I want to go back to Georgia... it's to avoid people who look at me the way you just did.Don't talk to me as if I were a child.

I can't drive a car.Got it.Oh, yes I am!Your chariot awaits, Madame!Tuesday!Can't wait to give you the tour!A small schoolhouse will go there. We need it badly as many of the children are barred from the local schools due to their infirmities.We also require a blacksmith's shop so we can craft braces here on the premises. I've found a wonderful local man who can make crutches and canes. His work is outstanding. Of course what is most desperately needed is a hospital. That's going to put my fund raising abilities to the test.That this will be the first polio rehabilitation and treatment center in the world. My personal trust almost covers the price of the Inn and the surrounding land. There will be a modest tuition charged to the patients which should hold us over while I seek out investors.Mama will see that the children are provided for.I have found something here which makes waking up in the morning remotely bearable and the two of you stand there...Practical? I am trapped inside a body that no longer moves of my own volition. I am trying to be practical. Now either you're with me or against me. In or out!Where are you going? Eleanor! Get back here.Oh really? Are you an expert on this now? How should I speak to my wife, Louis?Could be?When I can walk, I'll run.This is a very special night we're celebrating. At last we are together eating in this dining room!Now please join me in welcoming Miss Jackie Mills, a new arrival along with her father, Samuel, all the way from Oakland, California.Let us also take this opportunity to welcome our two able-bodied guests, Mr. Louis Howe and my better half, Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt.Now for the musical portion of our program...Before we say good night, I understand our Royal-Taskmaster- in-Residence, Miss Mahoney, insists on having the last word.Getting a doctor to live on the premises full-time. Someone who, at the very least, could monitor our progress. Make us legitimate.Yes.But the real problem is no one is interested. The annual Orthopedics Convention is being held in Atlanta this weekend and I offered to speak. They turned me down flat.We?What are you suggesting?Good night, Babs.Good afternoon!Are you sure this worked on 27th Street?Patients can stay in these waters for up to an hour. This is essential in allowing them the time to work on strengthening their muscles.The sooner the better.Who are you?I'll teach you.Babs... words fail me.It is. How's the Boll Weevil situation?Hello, Souders. How are you?... Couldn't be better. I was wondering if you'd found a buyer for my naval prints? I see. Well, they're in marvelous condition... All right, Souders. Oh one more thing... I have some beautiful pieces of my Grandfather's -- T'ang Dynasty... Really?... An auction in the Fall? That sounds promising. I'll be in touch.What am I going to tell these people if I have to close things down?Any good news?The operative word was good.\"... therefore, in conclusion, my research has shown that the overwhelming majority of patients here have shown some improvement.

They'll be writing my obituary before I get up off the floor.Who are we fooling? This will never work. They'll never let me back into politics. They'll never see past my legs.Oh, you'll be with me. No question of that. I am proud more than you will ever know to be part of this community. A community based not on birthright or privilege, but on compassion and courage. The true power of these waters is that they brought us all together. Our ability to help one another is what will make our victory over polio endure. Our ability to survive... despite the odds. ranklin looks out at the sea of faces.What we have done and will continue to do until this disease is defeated is come together -- like a family -- and do what we do best... Lift each other up.Miss Mahoney I need to speak with you, please.Thank you.Don't wear it in the pool.I'm throwing myself to the wolves.I'll always come back here.You're being superstitious, Louis.

That it is impossible to ever see an entire elephant from one place -- you must walk around it. If our elected leaders are to be truly effective then they must be willing to go out of their way to look beyond what is right in front of them. To see the entire elephant.

A springboard for you to run for Governor.Ever hear of a Civil War General named Francis Nicholls?Well, I never heard of him either. But this was one brave son-of-a- bitch. Fought for the Confederacy and lost his left arm in one battle and his left foot in another. Then after the war he ran and won the Governorship of Louisiana -- twice!Twice. Look, I've worked like a dog to keep your name in play, grovelling at the feet of the powers-that-be in back rooms.I'll be damned if I'm going to let you pass up a chance like this. It's time -- and you're ready.Your turn.You ain't seen nothin' yet.I'll be damned.That's good.What is it? What's wrong?If you fall, you show them how to get up.Elliot won't let you fall, he'll be there. All the arrangements have been made, boss. It'll be fine.In a box stage left. Give me your hand.Putting your big toe in the water.", "clean_line": "ask husband pointers pretty gifted public speaker think accepting invitation good franklin career street mrs roosevelt late honestly enjoy keeping people waiting ve got meeting representatives pittsburgh steel bid ship building contract turned desk approval problems lunch secretary daniels boss said yes people know time stop washington harvard club cavalier lord save fools love ve come far boss state assembly assistant secretary navy pages right cousin teddy play book road white house taking defeat lying boss ll run governor funny buys time buys experience vulnerable fresh face boss ll use advantage ve got parents photogenic natural hey boss right tired nap dinner visit god damned boy scout camp needs miss florida rainy season answered good nice whiskers look like chester arthur mean mother eleanor idea like ham eggs sunny fancy boss ll children wife wants come home concerned concerned life boat getting waiting come home kids aching oh chrissake picture woods georgia pennsylvania avenue little time thought want friendly face boy think time called louis maybe ve going wrong let wants change focus responsibility hyperventilate faint consume time energy far grand central station learn drive thing franklin risking talk like respect deserves look deny work important issue want run rehabilitation center want run office ready correct wrong think years old al little rough edges franklin help soften image let smith nomination bag guys count hey stansbury best misses lost weight ve prison food int meriwether inn hallway morning line stretches outside patients waiting seen franklin chatting expecting receiving priority attention hello roy believe ve come way hell hole houston started speech know golden opportunity springboard run governor hear civil war general named francis nicholls heard brave son bitch fought confederacy lost left arm battle left foot war ran won governorship louisiana twice twice look ve worked like dog play grovelling feet powers rooms ll damned going let pass chance like time ready turn ain seen nothin ll damned good wrong fall elliot won let fall ll arrangements boss ll fine box stage left hand putting big toe water"}, "TOM": {"raw_line": "You might say so, Lionel.A Mr. Roosevelt.No, he's dead.Go over to the livery stable...Tom, Mr. Roosevelt.Franklin.Pleased to make your acquaintance.I'll send a wagon right over.Not long.No we don't.You'll have a great deal of privacy. There are only a few guests right now as it's the off- season... I'm hoping to make some improvements by next Spring --Look on the bright side. Most of your time will be spent in the water. It's true, we've fallen on some hard times...Yes, we've seen better days. But then I imagine so have you.I'm happy to drive you back to the train station right now, if that's what you want.We've got options.Why don't you ask him yourself?Mr. Roosevelt, I'd like you to meet Aunt Sally.Now give it a minute. You'll see that the mineralization makes the water more buoyant. The crippled boy who swam here was actually able to walk in the water.Warm Springs.Haven't been in a drinking mood lately.Actually, its the most god-awful martini I've ever tasted.Well, I never tasted a martini this bad before.So they say.To standing on your own two feet!Morning.Congratulations. Listen, Franklin, I got word a local reporter wants to do a story on you.Small town -- word gets out. It probably won't amount to more than a provincial puff piece but it might give us some free publicity for the Inn.All right, I know the gentleman. I'm doing him a favor. You know, I used to be a journalist.Not anymore. I got in a bit of trouble in Atlanta. Seems some of the editorial pieces I wrote offended the sensibilities of a local civic group. So I needed to lay low for a while.Rat-trap?They welcomed your company, Franklin.Don't patronize them. These people go to bed night after night with half-empty stomachs -- your legs are the least of their worries.Franklin, we need to talk... Normally we close up this time of year and the staff goes home for the holidays.It's just an ulcer. I can't eat anything I like anymore.Yes, they are.Ready to swim?We've got some new guests. Some paying, some non-paying...The interview you gave was syndicated in Sunday papers all over the country.They're here to see you.This isn't your personal spa! I have a business to run.No one's asking anything of you!Do you know what it took for most of them to get here?My God, you're afraid of these people.You look at them with the same repulsion and pity as everyone else.You don't want to be around them because then that would make you one of them, wouldn't it?Good evening.Yes.I'm looking for a young gentleman by the name of Botts. Fred Botts?I expect he would be in a wheelchair.His pulse is slow.Knoxville had to be three days ago.Franklin...Atlanta.Closer, but not by much.Fewer than half.Well, it's the way it has to be.I've already had some complaints. This is the start of the season, Franklin. I've got regulars who have come for years. Healthy folks over all... They're threatening to check out, afraid they might catch polio.I'm going to have to ask that you not use the pool during regular hours. I'll put time aside for you late in the day... and it won't be possible for you to eat in the dining room either. But I promise I'll find someplace suitable.Of course for you I can make other accommodations.Thank you.For Fred?Sounds like you've been reading up.It's a waste. An awful waste.Roughly twelve hundred or so. Why?Investment?It would take money. There's a lot of land, rebuilding the inn, adding ramps and so many people can't pay...He'll sell.Have you taken a look at this place?Want to tell them your good news?I'll see your twenty-five and raise you twenty-five.It's twenty-five cents not twenty- five dollars.Take it. I was bluffing.Going to Asheville to see my parents.You. I've got cancer, Franklin. It's spread everywhere.I've seen the best doctors. When you were in New York they opened me up for the second time. Now I just want to die in the bed I was born.You're going to do great things. This place has an identity now -- a purpose. It has you.Take care of yourself, Roy.On the contrary, I envy you.Good luck, Franklin.", "clean_line": "lionel mr roosevelt dead livery stable tom mr roosevelt franklin pleased acquaintance ll send wagon right long ll great deal privacy guests right season hoping improvements spring look bright time spent water true ve fallen hard times yes ve seen better days imagine happy drive train station right want ve got options ask mr roosevelt like meet aunt sally minute ll mineralization makes water buoyant crippled boy swam actually able walk water warm springs haven drinking mood lately actually god awful martini ve tasted tasted martini bad standing feet morning congratulations listen franklin got word local reporter wants story small town word gets probably won provincial puff piece free publicity inn right know gentleman favor know journalist anymore got bit trouble atlanta editorial pieces wrote offended sensibilities local civic group needed lay low rat trap welcomed company franklin patronize people bed night night half stomachs legs worries franklin need talk normally close time year staff goes home holidays ulcer eat like anymore yes ready swim ve got new guests paying non paying interview gave syndicated sunday papers country isn personal spa business run asking know took god afraid people look repulsion pity want wouldn good evening yes looking young gentleman botts fred botts expect wheelchair pulse slow knoxville days ago franklin atlanta closer fewer half way ve complaints start season franklin ve got regulars come years healthy folks threatening check afraid catch polio going ask use pool regular hours ll time aside late day won possible eat dining room promise ll someplace suitable course accommodations thank fred sounds like ve reading waste awful waste roughly investment money lot land rebuilding inn adding ramps people pay ll sell taken look place want tell good news ll raise cents dollars bluffing going asheville parents ve got cancer franklin spread ve seen best doctors new york opened second time want die bed born going great things place identity purpose care roy contrary envy good luck franklin"}}}
