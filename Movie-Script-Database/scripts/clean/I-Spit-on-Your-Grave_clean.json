{"I-Spit-on-Your-Grave": {"JENNIFER": {"raw_line": "Hello?Hello?Hello?It's fine, really. I'm Jennifer Hills. We spoke last week..on Mockingbird Trail.Afraid not.Well if I get lost I'll just ask for directions.No, no. I'm looking forward to the peace and quiet. I'm a novelist. I'm starting my next book.No, it's fine. I'm sort of lost anyway. Looking for Mockingbird Trail?Really? I thought--Oh, okay, I think I saw that.Uh... no. I mean yes.How's that line working for you?Let me just...No I got it--Sorry. I accidentally hit the panic button. Are you okay?Sure you okay?Sorry, something just... Another slam, and again.Hello? In response, she gets the frantic CHIRPING of crickets as night encroaches. Jennifer walks down a path and in the near distance she see aShit!Ohhhhh... You gotta be kidding. She get up, looks at the red wine stain all over her lap, and picks up her things to heads in the cabin.Way to go Jennifer... The last of the days light is disappearing.Eww! The spray only lasts a few seconds before sputtering out. However, then the toilet starts to GURGLE. Jennifer lifts the lid up with her foot. The toilet water bubbles up and then disappears down the drain.Oh shit! Jennifer reaches down into the toilet and immediately fishes it out. She shakes it off vigorously.Uh... thanks for coming on such short notice.Is this gonna take much longer?So what's wrong with it?So do you live around here?Yeah, I kind of get that. I meant in town? Matthew comes out from under the sink. He snaps nerviously at one of the rubber bands on his wrist.Thank you! Matthew blushes furiously and fumbles his tools as he packs up. For him, the kiss was more embarrassing than enjoyable.I'm sorry. I just... you saved me from having to bathe in the pond. Once his tools are all packed away, Matthew dashes out of the cabin. Jennifer follows him to the front door.Hey. Hey! I didn't even pay you! But Matthew is long gone.Hello? Silence. Jennifer rises up on her toes and looks out the glass window of the front door. The porch is deserted. Jennifer opens the door slowly.Get out of here. Get out of here right now!All of you better get out of here. I called the police. Johnny nods. He looks at her, his gaze mocking.I... I called them already. They're on their way right now!That is just not true! I tried to. He ran out... Is that what you said? Matthew winces and starts to snap a rubber band on his wrist. as Jennifer walks over to her purse.I'll take care of it-- Johnny cuts her off.I'm writing. I'm a Writer... But my boyfriend is coming up. He'll actually be here any minute--No, look. I have the money-- Andy slingshots the thong right at Jennifer. It lands at her feet.Please, I don't want to. Johnny raises his eyebrows. The bottle is partially empty.I didn't say that. Andy walks over and sits down at her desk, clicks around the screen, begins reading aloud from the text...Can you all please leave me alone?! Meanwhile, Stanley putters around the kitchen, opening and closing the cabinet doors, knocking stuff around. He finds a pack of rice cakes. He shoves one in his mouth, winces, spits it out.Look, can you just tell me what you want? What do you want? I offered you money. Johnny stubbornly holds out the bottle of vodka. Andy giggles. He finds this quite funny.Fine, if you'll leave I'll take a drink. Jennifer studies the bottle and finally accepts it. Drinks a small sip. They all start booing.I took the drink, now you--Look, I'm sorry if I embarrassed you the other day, but we're even now, right? Okay. Please. Leave. Andy and Stanley plop themselves down on the couch and prop their feet up on the wood and glass coffee table.Then what is this about? Johnny jumps down from the counter. He stands in front of Jennifer, towering over her.Wha... what?That's... I'm not going to... please leave.Now please... I'm begging you... Johnny slides off the counter.Help me. Please! Standing next to the Sheriff, also holding a hunting rifle, is Earl. Earl looks over at the Sheriff.I was assaulted! They broke into the cabin! They had a gun- Jennifer breaks down again.In my mouth! He put a gun in my mouth! You don't understand...Four men. It was four of them. They broke into my cabin... They assaulted me! Earl just watches not knowing what to do.Yes, I'd seen them before.At the service station right outside of town. They work there.Yes. They called him Johnny. There was a heavy set guy too--Hills. Jennifer Hills.Yes.I wasn't going to drink it all this weekend. I... I planned on being here for a couple of months.Yes, well, they were. They forced me to. He moves away and walks back through the cabin. As he does, he spots the glass shattered on the floor... and the nearby THONG and BRA that Andy flung at her. Takes a long hard look at them, then looks back up to Jennifer.One of them, he was up there, went through everything.Please, I don't care about those things. They shoved a gun in my mouth... Jennifer breaks down again as the Sheriff moves toward her.Yes. Of course.Just a few days.No. Not really. I stopped for gas and directions.Uh... n...no. The men probably left it. Sheriff Storch walks over to Jennifer until he's standing directly in front of her.Please, I swear. I didn't make it up. I may have smoked a joint, but- Sheriff Storch lifts his walkie-talkie to his mouth.What?! They were here! They assaulted me! You've got to believe me!Please...How do you know, Matthew? Matthew props himself up with his hands and manages to get into a sitting position.How do you know I'm alive? Are you sure you're'not dreaming again? Matthew shakes his head quickly from side to side. He's not sure of anything any more.Come here. Come sit down. Matthew staggers to his feet. He's overcome with emotion.Shh... it's all okay, Matthew. I know that none of this was your fault. You tried to help me.I know that, Matthew. Now come. Matthew sits down next to Jennifer. It's almost as if some force is controlling him. Matthew looks into her eyes. He leans forwards and rests his head in Jennifer's lap. He finally lets himself go, like a child having a meltdown.Shh...I know. I know you are. Matthew's so caught up in the moment, that he fails to notice A ROPE from the tool shed with a good SLIT KNOT being snaked around his neck.But tell me again, Matthew. I want to hear how sorry you are. Matthew's eyes fly open. Jennifer's hands jerk backwards. The rope digs into his flesh. He tries to speak but his windpipe can't produce any sound. Matthew rolls to the floor, Jennifer never loses her grasp. She stands over Matthew, twisting the rope as hard as she can. His eyes bulge, the veins in his face protrude-- Realizing he's about to slip away forever, Matthew displays one last burst of strength but Jennifer uses her leverage to get her foot on his chest and pulls harder. Frightened and furious, Matthew whips Jennifer around again. But she refuses to let go.Tell me again... CLOSE ON: Matthew's mouth. He can't actually speak; his voice box shattered. But he mouths the words.I'm sorry? That's just not good enough. She pulls the slip knot around his neck again and begins toNow I want you to cry like a little girl for me. Matthew begins to wail.Forgive me father, for I will sin.I know. You like to watch. Don't you. Don't you worry, I'll give you quite a show. She sets the camera on top of a tri-pod right in front of his face, frames up and hits record. She looks up to him. Stanley's arms are tied behind a tree, his head is held in position, duct tapped back against the tree. His legs are anchored to the ground. The bloody mangled one still in the bear trap that bites and gnaws at his leg with every move.Since you like to watch. She flips the monitor of the camera toward him just like he did to her. She stands in front of Stanley's face. Stanley wants to say something but his pain is too intense.Can't talk, can you? Well, maybe it's because you're hungry. Jennifer goes to grabs something behind her.You know, you have to eat some real nasty shit out here to stay alive.What's wrong, you don't like it? I prefer the maggots to the meat. Jennifer site down next to Stanley. She glances over to the monitor to see what he is looking at. Then she reaches over and into a burlap sack. Stanley stares straight ahead, at the monitor in front of him. Jennifer reaches into the burlap bag and takes out a roll of fishing line. Then she takes out a pack of fish hooks. Stanley's eyes go wide. Jennifer removes the hooks from their package. She holds one between her thumb and forefinger and studies the barbed tip. Smiling to herself, she threads the hooks with fishing line.I'll be back before you have a chance to blink. Jennifer stands up and brushes herself off and walks to-- WITH ANDY: Jennifer comes over and slaps him in the head.How ya' doing sport?Please? I thought, no, I'm pretty sure you said something like this... Jennifer grabs a wad of his HAIR and SMASHES his face intoSuck it bitch. She pulls his head back up.Does that ring any bells? Jennifer gets real close to his ear--Bi tch. She holds his head down for a very long time as his body struggles - then up. Andy gasps for breath as Stanley's screams get louder--I think Stanley's calling me. I'll be right back. If you need me- She walks off--Like the show so far?Let me help you. Jennifer takes a slender knife from the bag. Working quickly, Jennifer guts a FISH.Here, this might feel better. She leans in and smears the bloody fish guts onto Stanley's eyeballs.Don't drown too soon. Andy tries to buck her off, gasping for breath, buckling under her added weight. Jennifer slams his head back into the water, and then up again... then down as she holds it.Hold it... hold it... hold it... Then she pulls his head back up as Andy spits water all over.Now is that any way to talk to a lady? And back down with his head - it is exhausting to watch. WITH STANLEY: As a single CROW shows up by his head. He tries to look at the bird to see what it is doing, but he can't move. ON THE MONITOR: The CROW has jumped onto Stanley's head - looking at his eyes -- It begins to peck at them. StanleyI'm impressed. You got a lot of fight in you. Let's see how you do now. Jennifer brings forth the bucket.oh, just some lye I found laying around.Let's see how long you can keep that pretty little face of yours. Andy strains to keep his head faced at her.You already did that. I didn't enjoy it much. Now it's my turn to fuck you. Andy's neck is straining to keep his head out.That's an awfully big head you got. Your neck must be getting tired. Every vein in his neck now bulges. Andy's eyes start to water with tears.Andy?Fuck you. Andy's neck gives out dunking his head in the lye bath. He writhes with pain as he lifts it back out - BEET RED andIt's date night. Johnny cranes his neck and twists his body to see who's there as Jennifer walks out of the shadows. She saunters up to Johnny.Your mouth doesn't look so good. Maybe you should-- With a massive TUG she pulls back on the bridle that bites into his raw, bloody mouth.Oooh, you're an ornery stallion, aren't you? Jennifer tilts her head and looks at him, as you would a fascinating piece of art.Guess I'm gonna have to tame you.Oh, that's the problem. You still have some teeth left. We're gonna have to fix that. Jennifer clamps the.pliers down tightly on Johnny's tooth. He tries to move but between the bridle cutting into his mouth and the pressure on the tooth, it's sheer agony. Jennifer jerks her hand from side to side, squeezing the tooth as hard as she can in the pliers. Finally, the root breaks free of the pulp and Johnny's tooth is extracted. Johnny flails around in severe agony.Save your strength. You got a few more races to run. Johnny screams something unholy. Jennifer holds the tooth up in the air and inspects it.I have to admit, I didn't think it went that far down. Jennifer sticks the pliers in again, latching it onto another tooth.That's disgusting. Even your boys didn't piss themselves. Be a man, will you?! Jennifer takes the bridle and yanks Johnny's around, the pain is so bad he can hardly fight. He grimaces and spits out a mouthful of blood at her.Now that's not gonna get you a sugar cube.We'll get to that. Jennifer pulls out a gun.Give him a kiss.Breathe through your nose. It helps. You know, like it was your first time. Johnny's body flails with all his might as- ABOVE: The eye hook loosens a bit more--I hear sometimes a stallion can get a little headstrong. They don't want to be trained... refuse to be broken...You slice off every ounce of their foul manhood. She slices it closed again. As Jennifer closes in, the look in Johnny's face says it all. But there is simply nothing he can do about it.You geld them. SLICE! - Johnny's eyes rolls back as he SCREAMS!!!! She holds the piece of limp, pink flesh in her hand. Despite everything he's been through, this brings forth an entirely new level of pain. He screams and bucks as the EYEHOOK continues to loosen. Jennifer bends down for a moment, bringing something up from the floor. She comes back to a screaming Johnny as she--No teeth show horse... no teeth. Johnny flails with all his might, screaming, spitting as-- ABOVE: The eye hook finally gives way. Johnny's tied hands come crashing down directly on top of Jennifer. Jennifer goes flying with a bloody enraged Johnny now free as he grabs and claws after her. Jennifer desperately kicks and scratches to get away from this hideous, blood-soaked monster - but Johnny grabs hold onto her leg - he drags her closer as she loses her grip-- With one solid kick, Jennifer connects with Johnny in the face - he sprawls out from pain - as she gets up and races out the door - Slamming it closed as she exits. She leans up against it holding it closed.Howdy, Sheriff.Hills. Jennifer Hills.I have to tell you, it's really been a pleasure meeting your family. You have a wonderful daughter with a bright and promising future.We'll see you soon, Sheriff.Does that hurt? Come on, I thought you were an ass man, Sheriff.I'd be careful how you speak to me at the moment, Sheriff. By \"she,\" I assume you mean your daughter?She really is lovely, Sheriff. So young. So sweet. I mean, can you imagine?Imagine if someone had done this to her. Jennifer walks behind the Sheriff. She wraps her fingers around the barrel of the gun and shoves it in, deeper. The Sheriff's expression is one of unbridled agony. Jennifer continues to sodomize him with the shotgun.Someone like Andy?So was I. She gets to the corner of the room where a hulking figure site tied up in a burlap sack. Jennifer removes it revealing a dead MATTHEW... or is he? She ties the line to Matthews wrist. The other end is tied onto the shotgun's trigger.Neither are you.He'll be waking up soon. If I were you, I'd tell him not to move.Sorry, Sheriff... She leans in close to his face.\"It was fun while it lasted\".", "clean_line": "hello hello hello fine jennifer hills spoke week mockingbird trail afraid lost ll ask directions looking forward peace

It's a good ten miles back, left turn after the big red mailbox.You, uh... staying at the cabin?You know, you're running a little hot. Want me to uh... maybe I should check under your hood?I don't know, how's it working for you?I'll get that.I'm fine.I said I was fine.What the hell are you two dipshits laughing at?!Humane you dipshit. Johnny site in a chair holding his fishing rod between his knees. A cigarette dangles from his mouth and a beer is perpetually glued to his hand.Hits my ass, now you two retards gonna fish or what? Matthew comes crashing out of the foliage, knocks over the cooler spilling ice and beer all over.Alright. Now we're all here, what's the big show, Stanley?What babe from the city?Bullshit. Matthew snaps the rubber band more. Johnny turns quickly to him.Cut that shit homo! How many times I gotta tell you. Stanley gets the camera ready.What's this about a kiss?Bullshit.Don't lie to me dipshit.Bullshit. I could tame that ass if I wanted to.Let me tell you something. I had her creaming in her panties.Bitch like that comes up here for one reason. Sitting in that window, tits flapping in the wind for all to see. You know?How do you know, ya fuckin' virgin? Let me tell you something. They're all like that! Fucking big city cock-teasing whore is all she is. He flicks his cigarette and it sizzles out in the water. Then he gets right up in Matthew's face.You'd have no idea what to do with a piece of ass like that. But luckily I'm your friend. Johnny hands him a beer and pats him on the back firmly.Nice shot huh? Jennifer shrieks and spins around only to find -- Standing there, right inside the front door, is Johnny. He smiles. Johnny shrugs calmly and continues milling about the room. Jennifer spins around, looking for a way out.Now that's not very hospitable, is it? Then, the wooden stairs creak under Andy's steps as he walks down -- around his chest is one of Jennifer's bra stretched to the limit. He's twirling a thong panty on his finger. The guys get a good laugh at Andy.You called the police? Or you will call the police?With what phone? Matthew said you dropped it in the drink. Jennifer doesn't answer.Speaking of.. .where the hell is he? Stanley takes a few steps toward the back door.--Let's not worry about that right now. Johnny hops up on the kitchen counter, cutting her off with his leg. He then picks up the bottle of vodka, takes a swig.Now what's a pretty little thing like you doing out here all alone?That right? The guys give a good chuckle-Well, I didn't realize you had a boyfriend coming down. We'd better get on outta here. Don't want to ruin date night.You know what I think. I think you're lying. There's no boyfriend. No man in his right mind would leave a girl like you all up here on your own.Yeah, well so will Santi Clause. Andy and Stanley are loving every minute of this. Matthew leans against the wall, his eyes on the floor.Come here. Have a drink with me.What's a matter? Too good to drink with us?Come on. You can do better than that. I bet when you're out there with your city friends you can throw 'em back with the best of them.I said drink it! Jennifer grows increasingly nervous and reluctantly takes a nice swig. Then chokes and gags. They all cheer.See? Now was that so bad? Johnny takes the bottle back and takes a swig himself.Oh... that's not what this is about.I want to see your teeth. As if the air is sucked out of the room. Jennifer stares at him, not even sure she heard him correctly. Matthew snaps the rubber band harder. He moves to the far corner of the room and tucks himself against the wall.You heard me, show Horse. Show me your teeth.Show the teeth... Andy walks over and hands Johnny the small wooden bat he used to kill the fish. Johnny smacks it against his palm..or lose the teeth.No. Put two fingers in the side of your mouth. Then two fingers in the other side... and pull. Jennifer looks at Johnny like he's seriously disturbed as Johnny slaps the bat against his hand punctuating his point. Jennifer puts her fingers in her mouth. She pulls her lips away from the gums, spreading them grotesquely. It's completely humiliating. Jennifer stops.Uh, uh. Again. Jennifer reinserts her fingers and pulls. Johnny reaches into her mouth and grabs a hold of her two front teeth with his thumb and forefinger.Alright. Good girl, Show Horse. Johnny pulls down on Jennifer's teeth, forcing her to the floor. Jennifer looks as if she's about to cry, near her on the ground is the broken glass. Stanley and Andy needle each other like schoolboys. Matthew shuffles nervously, clearly uncomfortable at being there.I'll tell you something sweetheart... know why you ain't got no boyfriend?... 'Cause all them city guys are faggots. Johnny turns to her.But uh... since he isn't here. Johnny pulls out his revolver.This is your man. He moves closer to her, rubbing the gun against her cheek, her chin. The blood drains from her face as -Why don't you give him a kiss- With terror in her eyes, Jennifer quickly kisses the gun-Nah, not like the peck you gave Matthew... let's see a real kiss. He slides the barrel into Jennifer's mouth. Jennifer gags instinctively. Johnny holds the back of her head, not allowing her to pull away, and offers some \"encouragement.\"Breathe through your nose. Breathe through your nose like it was your first time. Johnny pulls the gun out just a tiny bit and pushes it back into her cheek, causing it to bulge out. Naturally, Stanley and Andy both find this hysterical. Especially once Jennifer begins to cry.if I don't like your enthusiasm, I may cum early. And that's something you really don't want. Jennifer has no choice. She begins to fellate the gun, as deep as she can take it without gagging. Johnny closes his eyes and feigns pleasure. Finally, he's had enough. He retracts the gun as Jennifer recoils, gags. Her eyes begin to scan the cabin for any way out of this hell as Andy stands up from the couch.What do you mean you don't want to?Yeah, and tell the truth, show Horse. Jennifer snaps her head around again to see Johnny enter the cabin as Andy and Stanely push Matthew in front of them. Johnny walks over to Jennifer. He stands next to the Sheriff.Better yet, let's show him. As I recall, those pretty little lips couldn't get enough.Show him those teeth, Show Horse.Keep whinnying! Jennifer looks up at Sheriff Storch with pleading eyes. Sheriff Storch picks her up by her hair but-- Jennifer comes up swinging -- connecting with the Sheriff's face. The slightest scratch across his lip. Sheriff Storch turns beet red. He backhands her across the face sending her back down to the floor. A thin line of blood flows from her nose. The Sheriff looks over to Johnny, licks his lip and nods his head.Alright, come on, Show Horse. Get up. Or you won't get a sugar cube. Jennifer struggles to her feet. She stands in front of them, defenseless. Johnny grabs her hair and pulls her head far back. She lets out a half-moan.I'm not asking, now cut that rubber band shit faggot.Come on. Move that rear of your's Show Horse. Prance for us. Sheriff Storch stalks around her, taking it all in, then he walks back in closer to her, in her face.Prance like you mean it. Like you do when you want to get laid. With a swift, hard backhand, Sheriff Storch smacks her ass and hard.Jesus, Matthew. You're getting your ass whooped by a girl! Matthew snaps: He wraps his hands around her neck and begins pumping away like a lunatic. For some reason, the anger allows him to perform. Jennifer struggles to breathe. Luckily, before all oxygen to her brain is cut off, Matthew stops. He SCREAMS as he finishes. His hands fall from her neck as he collapses on top of her. The MEN all cheer as Matthew staggers to his feet -- weak. He looks like he could throw up -- and he does - right off to the side as the others just lose it! Jennifer curls herself into a ball and SOBS.Alright. This filly's got a few more races to run-- Sheriff Storch approaches Jennifer. Although she can't even turn around, she senses their presence. Storch gets down into her face.No teeth Show Horse. No teeth. Her vision grows hazy. The sky, water, and ground all seem to meld together.Don't you know you should wait for the lady?Don't be so proud of yourself Andy. I clocked you at just over two minutes. Jennifer musters up her last ounce of strength and gets to her feet. The men all stare, impressed at her resolve. Jennifer's torn clothes hang loosely off her body as she staggers away and wanders aimlessly away from them. It's a miracle she can even walk. She continues until the forest ends and she comes upon a--Yeah, too bad we have to put you down, Show Horse. in a final act of defiance, Jennifer falls back off the bridge and into the murky, moving water. immediately, the men rush to the edge of the bridge. The Sheriff's gun cocked and ready-- Tracking down the water - Not a sign. They all look down, waiting, still nothing.Sheriff? Sheriff Storch pulls back his gun, and adjusts his hat, deep in thought.Nothin'...Well, what now? Storch takes another look down the river, scanning it.I'll buff out the serial numbers too. Sell the parts at salvage. Storch nods in approval as his eyes wander to the camera.And there was no trace at all? Nothing in the woods? In the shallows? Andy shakes his head. Stanley rubs his eyes hard.Well ain't that the headline. Soon as we finish this and haul her car into the garage, you can stuff your face 'til you puke.Jesus Christ. He's not playing with a full deck as it is.The last thing we need is him getting squirrelly on us.We all got to make sure he keeps it together, okay?Maybe. Guarantee you they'll be back. Johnny looks up as Stanley stumbles into the garage, holding a six pack of beer.Just one, you hear me? Don't need you passing out on your watch you lightweight. Andy takes a large sip.The fuck's he doing down there?You'll keep lookin' till I tell ya' to stop. As he turns away there is a bag of Stanley's pork rinds, he grabs it and throws it at Stanley.Here's your supplies. Andy starts to laugh as Johnny exits.Something's spooked the cattle.What the hell's got your nuts tied in a sling? Stanley is completely out of breath.The hell you talking about?Wait a minute. You mean the one Storch smashed to bits. That tape?You stupid retard piece of shit. You tellin' me you kept the tape? Johnny grabs Stanley by the neck and slams him up against a car, and begins to Strangle the life out of him.Where is it?!You're too dumb to know how dumb you are. Where's the fuckin' tape?!Who else knew about it? A beat of silence hangs in theair.The kid's barely got one oar in the water and you just took it and shoved it up his ass. Andy walks by Stanley and slaps him in the head for good measure.Unfreakin' real. Do you understand the world of shit we are all in right now.Do you?!No... no. We don't breathe a word of this. Not a damn word. Sheriff gets wind of this, we'll all be having \"hunting accidents\": We clear? Johnny slaps Stanley in the head again for good measure.in the meantime, find that little shitwhit Matthew. Me and him are gonna have a talk.Hello? No answer at the door. Johnny groans and gets off the couch, annoyed at being disturbed. He walks over to the front door and yanks it open. The front porch is empty. Just as he's about to close the door, he glances down. There's a dead bird on the stoop. Johnny narrows his eyes and looks out into the night. Then he closes the door and returns to the couch.Shit ain't funny fuckers!!! See how funny a bullet in your ass is! When there's still no response -- Johnny finally backs up into the house and closes the door.Got dammit! This time, Johnny races to the door and yanks it open, cocking the gun on the way and fires into the night.Somebody threw it at my fuckin' door. Then snaps Matthew's rubber band at them it hits Stanley who winces.Did either of you find that little prick?Nah, genius over here reloaded. Tape you smashed had nothing on it. Storch looks to Johnny - then snaps his gun towards him.Hey, I just found out myself. Storch swings the gun back to Stanley.It's Matthew, Sheriff. Stanley kept the souvenir, but Matthew's the one that took it. The Sheriff backs off a beat, sizes up the situation. Johnny brings forth the shoe. Sheriff's eyes seethe with rage.The crazy bastard left me a present.Much? At all. Kid's fucked three ways to Sunday. We can't find him and trust me, we been looking..since when? Since last night... No Sheriff, I ain't heard from 'em. Johnny notices something in his small surveillance TV. ANGLE ON TV: A truck pulls up to the station, a hot woman in a skimpy outfit gets out of the truck. She pops the hood obscuring her once she does. Johnny sits up in his seat.Look, like I said, as soon as dipshit or fuckface show up or call in, I'll let you know. ASAP. Now I got a customer. Johnny hangs up and walks out of the station.Can I fill it up for you, ma'am? The woman wears sunglasses and slowly turns to Johnny. Johnny takes a long look from bottom to top - and when he gets to her face - it registers - but before he can do anything, Jennifer swings a tire iron and catches him right across the jaw. A handful of teeth, ejected by a spurt of fresh blood as Johnny falls face-first into the ground.Bithh... With a bunch of teeth missing, Johnny's lisp is pronounced. Jennifer saunters around him seductively. She removes something from behind her back and brings forth a rusty pair of pliers. Jennifer steps closer.Pleath...for the loth oth thod,Justh kill me. Kill me you bith.", "clean_line": "mean frighten definitely lost nah sure missed good miles left turn big red mailbox uh staying cabin know running little hot want uh maybe check hood know working ll

"SHERIFF STORCH": {"raw_line": "Okay, okay, I gotcha. The Sheriff helps Jennifer to her feet.Ma'am, please, you have to calm down. But Jennifer is hysterical, desperately holding back tears.Ma'am, It's okay. I'm the Sheriff. You need to take a deep breath and tell me what happened. Jennifer forces herself to take a deep breath and manages to pull herself together.Are you hurt? Do you need a hospital? Jennifer shakes her head.Okay, good. That's good. Did you get a good look at them? Can you ID 'em?Around here?Sounds like them boys been up to no good. Alright Earl. You best head on back. Me and Miss...Me and Miss Hills are gonna head on over to the cabin and straighten 'em out.Hello?Miller, if you're up there, you'll be leaving by the window. No answer. Sheriff Storch looks at Jennifer.Stay here. Sheriff Storch heads up the stairs. Jennifer, uncomfortable at being left alone, backs away to the wall. Every noise, every foot step makes her shiver. After a few seconds, the Sheriff comes back to the top of the stairs.It's empty. He walks back down.No sign of 'em. If they were here, they're gone now. Sheriff Storch makes his way through and walks back into--You here alone?Drink some tonight?They do this, too?Okay, okay Ma'am. It's okay now. Them boys are gone. You're safe now. Jennifer nods to him, still shaken. Storch looks to the lock on the back door. He walks toward the back door and turns the dead bolt back and forth.Was this locked?How long you been here?Anything strange happen before this? You have a run in with any of these guys?Ma'am, is this your marijuana cigarette? Suddenly, Jennifer realizes that simple possession might not go over in this small town like it does in Manhattan.You mean to tell me that one of these guys was wearing lipstick? Storch holds up the roach. Jennifer notices the lipstick smear on the rolling paper. She casts her eyes downward.This ain't the big city. Sheriff Storch stands uncomfortably close. Slowly, he walks closer up to Jennifer's face, stares into her eyelids. Pulls down one of them. Then the other. Then his gaze falls down to her chest... her ample cleavage. His stare lingers a bit too long.This is Sheriff Storch. I'm at the Mockingbird Cabin. I gonna need some backup. The words out of the Sheriff's mouth seem almost surreal.Ma'am. You've been drinking and smoking marijuana, and you got enough alcohol here to put our whole town three sheets to the wind. You're running around in your nighty at the crack of dawn... You need to see this from my point of view.I just want to get to the bottom of it. You're making serious accusations bout' boys I've know since they was kids, and you haven't been all together truthful now have you?Shoulder width apart, face to the wall. Jennifer has no choice but to comply. He pats up and down Jennifer's side. When he gets to the swell of her breast, he slides his hand to the front ever so slightly. Jennifer reflexively turns--Face to the wall! Sheriff Storch puts his hand to the side of her face and puts it to the wall. Jennifer cringes.I want the whole story, now. The whole thing.I asked you a question. Jennifer trembles with fear.Whinny. With her top lip forced up by the barrel of the shotgun, Jennifer can only make a GRUNTING noise. Sheriff Storch takes the shotgun out of Jennifer's mouth and places it flush against the side of her head. He pushes her to the floor. Jennifer lets out a YELP as she falls.I said, whinny. Jennifer makes a pathetic SOUND. Not really a whinny, but more of a half-cry, half-snort. Naturally, this amuses Andy and Stanley -- who is, of course, filming it -- to no end.Think you outta tame this little mare of yours. Johnny takes the Sheriff's lead.Well, maybe it's not totally his fault. After all, she's not doing much to get his motor running. Sheriff Storch looks back to Jennifer.Dance. Jennifer begins to cry again.Stop it. Or else I'll really give you something to cry about. Now dance for the boy... Jennifer starts to dance in the middle of the room. It is sad, pathetic, and downright frightening.You dance like that in those city clubs? Jennifer closes her eyes. Tears stream down her face.Don't waste my time you thickheaded prick.Get her legs! Sheriff Storch kneels down and holds Jennifer's arms above her head. Johnny takes one leg; Andy takes the other. Matthew moves on top of her. Jennifer lets out an inhuman SCREAM, the vocal culmination of it all. ON JENNIFER'S FACE: Her eyes are tightly shut as she goes in and out of focus. Suddenly, a cell phone RINGS. Sheriff Storch looks down at his pocket, then over to Stanley.Put that thing down and hold her arms, keep her quiet. Stanley places the CAM on top of the table - it's still getting everything. Sheriff Storch walks a few paces away from the rape. He looks down at the screen of his phone. On the PHONE is a photo of an angelic little girl with the banner of CHASTITY. Storch presses a button.I hope you got some fight left in you. I like it rough.Not to worry Darlin'. I'm an ass man. Sheriff Storch takes off his belt and unbuckles his pants. He kneels down behind her.. Jennifer SHRIEKS as her face contorts with a completely new level of pain as her head is thrust back down. Then, out of the corner of her eye, Jennifer catches a glimpse of the Sheriff's GUN, still sitting in its holster. Her eyes immediately go to Stanley who's busy swapping out the MINI-DV tape and replacing it with a new one-- Then she sees Matthew leaning against a tree, a vacant look in his eye twisting a rubber band through his fingers. Andy site on is ass, playing his harmonica... Her eyes continue to scan the area for Johnny who's nowhere in sight. Then immediately her eyes dart back to the GUN.Sorry. it was fun while it lasted.All you get your butts down there, check under the bridge, both banks, in the trees right now. They all look at him.I said right fuekin' now before I throw you over!Listen up. 'Bout six miles downstream the creek ends in Hendersonville. somewhere between here and there we're gonna find her. We split up. We check the banks, in the timber, under a rock, hell if you see a hole big enough for a rat I want it checked out. And don't stop 'til you find me a body.You just shut your trap and do every goddamned thing I say. I got a wife a kid and one in the oven. There is no way that I'm going to let anything happen to them because you're too stupid and too sloppy to clean up your fuckin' mess. The weight of the Sheriff's words register on all of them... except Matthew who oddly enough has started to come around -- as if he just woke up in the middle of this nightmare.Can someone get this dipshit outta my face! I don't need none of you screwing the pooch on this, least of all numbnuts over there. Sheriff Storch lets go of Stanley's collar and gives it a quick pat, almost like an imperceptible apology for his behavior.Now let's move... find me a body!The body'll turn up. One way or another. Every day we check the ravine, from the bridge, straight through down here, then back. Two shifts a day until we find something. 'Cause with no body, you're all as fucked as she is.'Til I say! Okay?! Andy, you go back to the cabin and get rid of her shit. All of it! Burn it. And we need to sanitize that place something good. I don't want so much as a stray hair left..and give me that. Sheriff Storch rips the camera from Stanley's hands. He pulls out the tape. He throws the tape to the ground and stomps on it, smashing it to bits. Stanley opens his mouth to say something, thinks better of it, and closes it quickly.The fuck were you saving that for moron?I need all you on point. I mean, on fuckin' point. We clear?Just the usual, domestic dispute out near Clifton. Took forever.Oh yeah, what am I gonna be proud of?Of course I can. I expect nothing less from my Angel.Every time I come in here this place gets worse. Earl's bent over one of the tanks, elbow-deep in fetid water.Yeah, well, you're lucky I don't cite you for being a public health hazard. Sheriff Storch reaches into his pocket and pulls out a set of keys. He holds them in the air and JINGLES them. Earl finally looks up, confused.Mockingbird Trail.Yeah, I couldn't make heads or tails of it. Found marijuana cigarettes, case of booze, looked to me like she was a party girl... a very wild one.Nah, place is fine. She packed up and split.Why's that?Christmas come early. Enjoy it.Me too.Earl?Yeah, so...Yeah, and... you know the story.Okay. I'll give her a call.Nah, It's late. I'll pick it up from you in the am. We're still on for tomorrow, right?Just fine.Can you believe there used to be a limit on quail? Goddamn things are like locust now.You're getting old, Earl. I remember back when you and my old man chased that buck out of the hollows on Stickler's Farm before bagging it.Here's to the good of days. Earl looks at him, surprised.And funerals. BLAM: -- Earl's chest erupts in a geyser of blood. Earl drops to the ground like a rag doll. The bottle falls from his grasp. The whisky flows into the dirt. Sheriff Storch stands up, clutching his smoking shotgun.Loose ends, Earl. Loose ends... Sheriff Storch hovers over his prey. Suddenly, Earl's body spasms. His eyes flicker and a nauseating gurgle sounds from deep in his throat. BLAM: -- Sheriff Storch crosses himself -- touching his forehead and both shoulders -- turns away from the corpse.Helen? Within seconds, Mrs. Storch materializes, apron on and wiping her hands on a dish towel.I've been --I guess.Help with what?What tape?Did Chastity see this?Where is she?I'll... I'll be back... Sheriff Storch quickly turns away from his wife and hurries out the door. Mrs. Storch stands at the door and watches with growing curiosity as the cruiser peels out of the driveway, a cloud of dust in its wake.Then you want to tell me why this was dropped off at my house?! To my WIFE! Storch shoves the TAPE in Stanley's mouth - gagging him. Then turns to Johnny.What's on that tape?! Is this some kind of fucked up joke? I smashed the damn thing myself!Eat that tape fatboy. Andy starts to laugh as Starch trains the gun back on them-See, there's two kinds of crazy people. One likes to get buck naked and howl at the moon. The other kind does the exact same thing, only in my backyard. The first kind'I don't have to deal with, you know? The Sheriff walks right into Stanley's face as he continues to chew the plastic.The second kind, well... you're in my yard.You dipshits bring him to me! I'm gonna cut his little pecker off and use it as a goddamn hood ornament.And that's after I'm done shoving it up your dirt hole. Now where is he?! Storch takes a deep breath. He looks at all of them, fuming.You losers couldn't find your own asses with both hands and a map.Hi, honey.Nothing, why?Long day, that's all.Mrs. Novick?Oh yeah, okay.Well, I'll be home when I can. Busy today. if I don't make it, send her my regards. Sheriff Storch ends the call. Two seconds later the phone rings again. He looks at it, annoyed, answers.I said I'd be there as soon as --Hi. It's truly an honor to speak with you Miss...Excuse me?What the fuck do you think you're doing!--No - wait-- But the call ends.Chastity! ... Chastity! Sheriff Storch throws the phone to the ground and slams on the gas.Chastity, where is she?! Mrs. Storch has absolutely no idea what is going on. In her mind, their daughter couldn't be in better hands.Goddamnit!Ahhhhhh! Jennifer walks over to the table and rests her elbow on it. Sheriff Storch speaks through gritted teeth.Where is she, you bitch? Jennifer slams the gun deeper. The Sheriff's body goes stiff. The Sheriff screams again.What'd you do to her?Imagine what?I'm begging you. Don't do this. We can figure something out. Matthew stirs again.Matthew don't!-- But it's too late - a startled Matthew jumps back--", "clean_line": "okay okay gotcha sheriff helps jennifer feet ma calm jennifer hysterical desperately holding
