They gotta let me fight.I need Angelo, Rudy, Ferdie --Cosell? This Muhammad Ali.Go to Georgia or Alabama or Sweden. Everybody know I'm the champ. The crown is a lie. I know it's a lie. Joe Frazier know it's a lie. It time for everybody to stop lying and tell the truth.I ain't interested in the paycheck, I'd fight Joe Frazier for free in a phone booth in Times Square, if I wasn't broke. I still will.I'm saying it's time for everybody to quit lying! Muhammad Ali is the champ! I have to, I'll get the fight on myself. And if they offer me money, I ain't gonna turn it down.You can't call me that no more.Whyn't you call an ambulance or a doctor?What's wrong with you, man?!I leave you alone.

Dead or alive!Put me on, Howard.I guarantee...it will be a historical and momentous night!...what Heavyweight Champion of the World? I'm not the champ. I am retired, finished, out of the game. And I ain't gonna let myself grieve and suffer none. But I know I will not fight again...If tomorrow they say: \"We want you to fight Joe Frazier. Madison Square Garden. Millions and millionses of dollars. Here's your license back.\" I will tell them: \"I am sorry, but I am done.\"You'll have to wonder...what me and Smokin' Joe would have looked like.Howard, you losing your hearing along with your hair? Don't put questions to it! I am through fighting. 'Cause I got a bigger and more important match comin' up. The U.S. government. A heavier contender.I don't know, but it's going to be a shocking and terrible fight. In fact, they might wish they let me stay in boxing.There you go, agitatin'. You ask Smokin' Joe what he been smokin'?! Joe Frazier even dream he can whup me? He better wake up and apologize... But, if I WAS to jump in the ring with Joe, here's what you might see... Ali comes out to meet Frazier, but Frazier starts to retreat; If Frazier goes back an inch farther, he'll wind up in a ringside seat; Ali swings with a left, Ali swings with a right. Frazier keeps backin', but there's not enough room. It a matter of time before Ali lowers the boom; Now Ali lands with a right, whata beautiful swing, But the punch lifts Frazier clean out of the ring. Frazier's still risin', but the referee wears a frown, 'Cause he can't start countin' 'til Frazier come down. And Frazier's disappeared from view. And the crowd is getting frantic. Then our radar stations pick him up. He's somewhere over the Atlantic. Who would have thought when they came to this fight, That they would witness the launching of a black satellite?But don't wait for they fight. 'Cause it ain't never gonna happen. You only can wonder and imagine...You want me to buy you a drink? Ali's dad sits on a crate, painting the door of a delivery truck. He looks up...Ali is there. Emotion wells up in both men. The younger \"rebelistic\" son, seeing his father, who is so like him. The older hep-cat who got cheated by life of his potential and promise. In this case, his boy, his boy's name, pride and reflected glory...I don't wanna fight no more. Not with you...Who dress you, Joe? You look like Dale Evans.To be closer to you, honey.There be two undefeated heavyweight champions! And they ain't fighting!'Cause you gotta get behind this and we gotta do this.You wanna get this on, Joe? You and me? Or not?!I can fight in Atlanta.Georgia ain't got no state boxing commission. And Atlanta got a black city council; a liberal Jewish mayor, Sam something. It all set. I do a prelim in Atlanta with Jerry Quarry. But we got to get the steamroller movin' now.You announce that if I beat Quarry you give me the title shot. So what you say...maaan?But you know you ain't the champ yet.I'm fine. Thanks.What you want?You want me to take you back?You can't hit what you can't see.All praise to Allah... ...Alaikum Salaam...You saying I can be a Muslim again, Herbert?I never stopped. Like I never stopped being champ.When? After I promoted Quarry fight? After I won it?I already got Frazier.Are we talking management, talking money or talking religion?When I got leery and talked up how come I'm broke, then came the suspension. Now, you explain that to me, my brother...?I love the Nation, Herbert. I love Elijah Muhammad. But it don't own me.Now, you go on out. And you make the Frazier deal.Yeah...What are you talking about, Howard? Quarry?I'm free.Supreme Court set me free.Hook's comin'. Lean back, man! Move back! WORK LEGS...!Shut up! I lost. Get outta here...Where's Belinda?My hands was in sand, Angie. My feet in water...Woulda, shoulda, coulda... After three-and-a-half years, this...from how far back...comeback is.I lost. You lose, you don't shoot yourself. The world goes on.Oh, how wrong he is.I ain't dead, baby! C'mon.I can move my jaw with my tongue. He got me...Ain't stoppin' nothin'...! Nothin' stoppin'...!Foreman call me one time after he won the Olympics...So.You think I still got the tools?Well, you better sharpen 'em up. 'Cause we goin' to Africa.It's time to be heavyweight champion of the world again.Man, you crazy.What are they saying, man?!!! Why they saying that?What's that mean?! I don't understand!What?!Ali, boma ye!Ali, boma ye!Fast. Six left jabs flash from his chest and shoulder, followed by a right hook and left and right uppercuts.Back up, maaan... ...you fast!Ali, boma ye George Foreman!You out, sucker! Curious, Ali runs behind the green signs from where the kids came.Foreman? I kill him!Shazaam!!!...even if I die here. If it kill me, no matter what...I gotta win.Howard! How many you ugly sportswriters in there got me over Foreman? Don't lie.What's the odds?This'll be the biggest upset since Sonny Liston. I want all of you to write it down! This fight is no contest!George Foreman is a big mummy. I've officially named him \"The Mummy.\"George punches are like \"Look out, here come the left.\" Whomp! Here come the right! Whomp! Like a Mummy. But \"The Mummy\" can't hit what it can't see. I'm fast! Gonna dance. Be all over George. George is gonna feel he surrounded. And I done somethin' new for this fight; I done rassled with an alligator. Anticipatory laughter. They've had twelve years' experience of Ali's stand-up and know when a new routine's starting...That's right! I have rassled with an alligator. I done tussled with a whale. I done handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder in jail. That's bad! Only last week I murdered a rock. Injured a stone. Hospitalized a brick. I'm so mean, I make medicine sick.Howard. I didn't want to talk about this, especially in front of everybody. But I talked to your wife! And she told me you're not the man you used to be...two years ago!Salaam Alaikum, brothers! The champ is here!Bottled water. Frozen steaks. Brought all this stuff like Africans don't have steaks...They eat it.Mobutu eats it...So? What's that do with any of why we here?Here come \"Herbert.\"Money? I do \"money-making\" whenever I want. Money is easy.Don King delivered the first black- promoted championship fight in Africa!'Cause clean-cut Muslims parading on the South Side of Chicago don't get this done! I got to put honkeys with connections and bad- ass niggers to it, too.That what this is? Think I gonna lose? Puttin' doubt on me?Sure.Truth is...George knocked hisself out.That's right. He did three rounds. Knew he was gonna lose to Muhammad Ali and knocked hisself out. And I predict that whenever the fight is set, he might not show up!I'm a bad man!And you tell the same thing to George.I been watchin' you! I heard you. I know he's your man.

ago...You know my name! You came to my school, right before you win the title. Interviewed you for the school paper. I was eleven.Yeah! You called me little Indian girl, then.I loved you then, like all those kids. I never stopped. I still do.First time? 1961...Sister Khalilah introduced you at assembly. You said you would be heavyweight champion of the world by the time you were twenty-one!I was eleven. I interviewed you for the student paper. You called me \"little Indian girl,\" 'cause I wore my hair real long, in a braid...I told you...\"Man, you scribble! You can't even write! You ought to go back to school until you do it better...\"She's got to be done with that bottle.No, he didn't. I told them about the one on the way...myself.You wanna try changing her, for the experience?That happen, you promise me you put some new people around you.Where are they when we need them? You got Gene Kilroy droppin' off groceries like charity. Borrowin' money from my folks. So...?Muhammad...?Hell, I can't. I'm defying them by talking to you. And being with you....you don't need their management...My God. They killed you!Here's your water.You could pick up parasites...You're seeing what you want to see, Muhammad...Mobutu is taking care of Mobutu and stealing all the wealth and sending it to Switzerland...We're here 'cause Don King got Mobutu to put up ten million dollars. Don King don't give a damn about Africa. He worse than Herbert.Yeah. 'Cause where was he when we was broke and borrowing money? And Bundini and all them that \"love you\"? Disappeared, is where they were. All over you when you got it and drop off you when you don't...And Don King fit right in...that double-breasted hipster is now a dashiki-wearing rip-off.Don King talks black, lives white and thinks green! Why you defending him and \"brother\" Herbert?And now they got you up against George Foreman. Do they give a damn you could get killed?I think: why is my Muslim husband letting himself get strung up on a cross...? It means, \"tell me.\"Maryum is sick. Maybe I oughta go back to Chicago and look after her.I'll be back before the fight. If that's all right, my husband...Hello, Muhammad. Bingham. Mr. Cosell.Just now. Muhammad, may I have a word with you, please?What is going on?But I don't have to have it thrown in my face. I don't have to read about it and have people call me up on the phone about it...Oh, hell, Muhammad, you got no discretion. You never did. You humiliate me!I clean for you. I cook for you. I feel every punch you take.Then why you got to be visible with women?I live with the casual ones. But this, this...I can't hold it together anymore.Then why do you disrespect me this way?!Do you love her?Do you want to marry her?\"You're following your heart\"? That's what you do.
