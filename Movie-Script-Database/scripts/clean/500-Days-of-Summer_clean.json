{"500-Days-of-Summer": {"TOM": {"raw_line": "Rachel? What are you doing here?Help me how?I think I'm gonna be sick.More.Does Mom know you're here? It's gotta be past 10.We spent the whole day together.We went shopping.We had coffee.We saw a film.We bought music.I thought it was a great day.Um...you know what...let's go crazy, I'll have BOTH. God, I love eating pancakes at night. It's like the greatest thing ever. How great is this?Just like that.I don't know. Who cares about normal?! I'm happy. Aren't you happy?You're not?That is such a lie!What do you know about PMS?Oh my god.Summer, Sid stabbed Nancy seven times with a kitchen knife. We've had some disagreements but I hardly think I'm Sid Vicious.So I'm Nancy?!I don't know what I'm gonna do.I'm gonna throw up.No.Well they're wrong. It's not true. I've fished in that sea. I've jumped in and swam in that sea! I'm fucking Aquaman! Sorry. What I mean is... there are no other fish. This was my fish.I'm in love with Summer.I love her smile.I love her hair.I love her knees.I love how one eye is higher up on her face than the other eye.I love the scar on her neck from this operation she had as a kid.I love how she looks in my Clash T- shirt.I love how she looks when she's sleeping.I love the sound of her laugh.I love how I hear this song every time I think of her.I love how she makes me feel. Like anything's possible. Like, I don't know...like life is worth it.For real, Paul. I'm madly in love with that girl.What do we know about this new girl?The new girl. Summer. In Vance's office.Really?Maybe she was just in a hurry.Damn.That makes me so mad! Why is it pretty girls always think they can treat people like crap and get away with it?Like, just cause she has high cheekbones and soft skin...And maybe the world's most perfect breasts...Just cause of that stuff, she can walk around like she's center of the universe?Ugh. You know what? Screw her! We haven't even met and I can't stand her already.Sorry?You like the Smiths?Oh my god.Hi.So, uh, Summer...Yeah! How's it going so far?Both... Either.Oh, you know, 4, 5... years.Are you nuts? I don't even want to do it now.I studied to be an architect actually.Eh, you know. Same old story. Moved to the city to work for a company. Company went under. Needed a job. My friend worked here. Got me this.Well I wrote that one.It's a big seller.Oh... No. I doubt it.Why thank you. That's what they called me in college. \"Perfectly adequate\" Hansen.Ok, well, I'll see you around.And it turns out she's read every Graham Greene novel ever published. Her desk is lined with Magritte posters and Edward Hopper.We're so compatible it's insane! Seriously! It doesn't make sense! She's not like I thought at all. She's... amazing.What?Of course it does.Hey Martin.I'm so glad we decided to go away together Bec. I know we've only been dating a few months but it's been...awesome.And now, you and me, 8 days in Mexico... best spring break ever!What's complicated? Last week you said you loved me!No, this can't be. Everything was going so great. I don't understand.What's this?Sure. It's all you wanted to listen to for weeks.Ok...What does this have to do with--?But Amanda... this is a great fucking song!It's off.Me and Summer.No. But it could have been. In a world where good things happen to me.No.You ready for this?So there we are. All alone. Nine more floors to ride. Plenty of time. I figure...this is my chance. If not now when, right?Summer...So how was your weekend?You believe that shit?\"It was good.\" She didn't say \"It was good.\" She said \"It was good.\" Emphasis on the good. She basically said \"I spent the weekend having sex with this guy I met at the gym.\" Fucking whore. Screw her. It's over.She's not interested in me. There's nothing I can do.And some other things.I gave her all sorts of chances.I think you know what I need.Toner.Do you want to go out with me?And the Priest says, \"But we're already out!\"I know!Not once did she take the bait. Not once. Screw it. I'm done with her. It's over.No way McKenzie. Absolutely not.They won't let you back in there after last time.Not at all. You just threw up on the stage, tried to fight the bartender, and then threatened to burn the place down before passing out on the sidewalk. Quiet night for you.We are not going back there.I really can't. Even if I wanted to. There's a lot of stuff I gotta take care of.What?Hi.You asked if I was coming? I mean...my plans got cancelled...You were great up there, by the way.I hear that.Lived there til I was 12.No kidding? What's his name?That makes sense.But...what if you meet someone and fall in love?Of course I do.Summer, hold on... you don't believe in love?Well mine too but --Well...I think it's...kind of a huge thing.Nooo. I don't sing in public.I don't...Anyway, I'm not near drunk enough to sing in front of all these people.It would take at least ten shots to get me to sing.That's not it.I have no idea.Me too. Why can't we think of the stupid A-Team theme song.This is gonna bother me for weeks.Oh here we go.Ok, let's get you in a cab.He'll be fine.What's up?Ok, goodnight McKenzie!Sorry you had to see that. Happens every time we come here. It's unbelievable. Something about that guy and singing for people. I don't know. But at least he didn't --What?Yeah. I like you. Of course I do.Right. As a friend.Yes. I mean... I haven't really thought about... Yes. Why?Oh yeah totally. Friends. You and me. That's... perfect.Cool.G'night Summer.Friends. Awesome. That's just great. Well done Hansen, you idiot.Hey!Hey Mr. Vance.Shhh.I have not been...Paul, seriously...No!No!No, Paul, no jobs. I'm still unemployed. We just kissed.Shhh!If you heard...Excellent. You ready to go.He exaggerates!Check them out.That is hot.I am very turned on right now.Huh?9, 9.5?If we're lucky, there won't be a dismount.I hear ya. If I want to watch people make out, I have big windows and binoculars at home.No. That would be wrong.Thanks.Sure.Not me.Sure.Yeah.I'll be...back in a sec.Settle. Don't get too excited. She's just a girl. There's lots of them. Who look like that. And like what you like. They're everywhere. Calm yourself.Are you calm? Ok. Then it's time to go back in.Oh sweet Jesus!I fucking hate Summer.I hate her crooked teeth.I hate her 1950s haircut.I hate her knobby knees.I hate her lopsided, asymmetrical, cock-eyed head.I hate that centipede-shaped scar.I hate her...stupid...big boobs.I hate the way she sleeps.I hate the way she laughs.I HATE THIS FUCKING SONG!It's very... complex.I feel the same way.You wanna go to the movies?A lot of people have problems with this, but to me, it makes both structures so much more beautiful side by side like that.The guy who made this, Maybeck, he is a God.It just makes you feel... peaceful.No. See now, this is torture.Over there, that's St. Patrick's church. The beauty of St. Patrick's is its humility. With this giant mirror thing deflecting all the attention away, it's too humble. No one even knows it's there.There's a million things. First, there's no need for this much glass. You could easily...What?See this beam, it steps on the landscape. But if we moved it... just so...No you go first.Whatever you want.Hello?That's it!Ow!There's no way.\"Octopus's Garden?\" You may as well just say \"Piggies?\"You're insane.Cause nobody loves Ringo.I don't know.I wouldn't say that.Like, are we \"going steady?\" Come on, guys. We're adults.It is when you've been with the same girl since high school.Something like that.No! She's not... We're not like that.We've just been... hanging out.Yeah. Guys, look, Summer and I...we know how we feel. We don't need to label it. \"Boyfriend, girlfriend.\" That stuff is very... juvenile.I don't know... Maybe.No. We're adults. It'll be fine.Maybe.My thinking is... why rock the boat? Things are going well. If we start putting labels on it, that's like the kiss of death. Like saying to a girl \"I love you.\"Who the hell's Sean?Who the f--! Never mind. Help me. I need solid female advice.Yeah but, you know me. This is the kinda stuff that always gets me in trouble.Something like that.Who's Lars?That son of a bitch.Coach, no, wait! I need her. Rachel, what do you think I should do?Hi.Yeah.Summer, I've gotta ask you something.\"So he broke your heart. You've been sad and depressed for weeks. Perhaps you've turned to drinking or even drugs. And nothing's helped. Now what? Should you binge on rocky road and watch soaps all day?\"\"No you should not.\"\"Through extensive research, we have found the six most effective ways to get over that lost love and make room in your heart for a new man to fill.

I bet you can hardly remember his face at all.\"I just don't get women's fashion nowadays. Everybody with the tattoos, the giant hoop earrings, those annoying hats. Explain this to me.Do you?I like how you dress.Please don't.Hi. I'm Tom.Hey buddy --Did you see that punch? I don't know where it came from. I haven't punched someone since Josh Greenberg in fifth grade. Guess I'm gonna have to throw out this shirt.Hey. What is it?What?You're mad at me? I just got my ass kicked for you.Come on, that guy was an asshole!I don't know. He was --Whoa. What was that?What...?I just got my ass kicked!I got one good shot in.Hi.What's up?Ok.Wait, are you still mad at me?Holy shit you are. I can't believe you!Yeah. I'm all done.You know what... Sometimes you really don't make any sense.Huh?I am. I'm sorry for acting like a jerk.Summer... we don't have to label what we're doing. I just... I need -Consistency. I need to know you won't wake up tomorrow and feel a different way.Have you ever had a real \"boyfriend?\"A boyfriend. \"Going steady.\" Whatever. You know what I mean.More than one?Tell me about them.Why?Come on, I'm interested.Yes.No. Yeah. I don't know. Why not? I can take it.Quarterback slash homecoming king?What happened to Markus?Ok. And then?The Puma?And that's it?What happened? Why didn't they work out?Since grade school.Yeah.Great.Ok.Sorry.Uh-huh.No thanks.I'm sorry. It's just... there's this girl.I'm not usually like this. I wasn't before... Long story short, she wrecked me. I don't know if you can tell but it was pretty recent and I'm still kinda thinking about her.I can't get her out of my head, you know? I see her everywhere. She's all I think about. And it's horrible. Cause I totally didn't see it coming. I thought things were fine. So now I keep going through every day in my mind, every second really. Wondering. What went wrong? Is it my fault? Could I have prevented it somehow?A lot of people have problems with this, but to me, it makes both structures so much more beautiful side by side like that.Maybe there were things I could have said or done, you know?Or... Christ, I don't know, maybe she was never that interested in me to begin with.How was your weekend?Anyway... sorry. If I'm acting strange, that's why.Actually she was never my girlfriend.I just... I thought I'd have figured it out by now, you know? My life. Where I'm going, where I want to end up, who with. All that stuff. I still don't know anything. And the thing is... When I was with Summer, none of that mattered. I never even noticed how much of my life was missing! Isn't that weird?Sure. Hey, I've been talking non-stop. You talk.So what do you think? Did I do something? Did I not do something? What can I do now?Oh! You know what we should do...\"You said you'd stand by your man!/So tell me something I don't understand. You said you loved me!/And that's a fact! And then you left me, said you felt trapped!\"You didn't stand by me! Not at all! You didn't stand by me,\" I'm talking about you Summer!Hello me. You having a good day?What? Why?Well... You don't want to just, maybe, go to dinner. I mean, you've gotta eat right?Sorta.Hey, no, that's cool. Whatever you want to do.Sure.Good night. Hey, Happy... birthday.Nope. All done. What are you working on?Why don't you try... \"Everyday you make me proud. But today, you get a card.\"No worries.This is good Millie. \"To my wife, the love of my life. I love you.\" That's very nice. I was thinking though, why not try something like... \"Everyday that we don't meet is meaningless and incomplete.\" You know, spice it up a little.Did you try... \"Merry?\"What else you got?\"...aint no woman got what you got, sista girl. Happy birthday to the lean, sheen, and sizzly mocha queen!\" How's that?Yeah. It's pretty cool.You really want to see this?It's, like, all stabbing and shit.Ok.Fantastic.Oh shit.Hi Mom.Mom, Martin, this is Summer.Well this is the girl friend I've told you about. I don't know if \"girlfriend\" is the right word...Sorry about that.You wanna go do something else? We can totally bolt.What?! No way... I never used that word.He's very...loving.You're having enough for both of us.No.Where were you an hour ago? I might have danced then. I've been standing here by myself this whole time and you didn't look over once.I'm not pissed. Summer... you know I hate this shit.This is what you wanted to do so...we're doing it.That's real nice.You wanted to see me, Mr. Vance?Ok.What do you mean?No.Who?Your...?I'm not following.Mr. Vance... are you firing me?Ok. Well, I'm sorry. Things for me have been a little difficult.Funerals and sympathy?What's going on?Ok.Do I want to hear it?You guys, look, I'm... I appreciate what you're saying and, thank you, really, for putting up with me these past few months. I've been crazy. But I've accepted the fact that she and I were just two very different people who wanted very different things. I wanted to get serious. Shit, I loved her. And I know now, she just isn't the kind of girl who can settle down with one person and be happy. The way I wanted. And she probably never will. There was nothing I could do.There's no fucking way!It can't be. It's impossible!How do you know?Jesus Christ people! Get a room!What? Oh yeah. Great.Twinkies?I'm out of twinkies.Go... where?Hmm?Uh...no. I really don't.Well I wouldn't say nothing... Actually, that's about right.You know what...?Can I say something about the cat?This here is, and Rhoda, you know I mean no disrespect... but this... this is total shit.\"Don't give up?\" \"You can do it?\"This isn't inspirational. It's suicidal. He tries that jump, I'm writing a sympathy card for that cat. That's the last thing I want to be doing with my life. It's bad enough writing these things for people.That's cause we're liars! It's what we do here. Why don't we level with people? Stop feeding them nonsense?Yes but think about it! Why do people buy these things? Not to say how they feel. There's paper and pens for that. People give these cards when they can't say how they feel. Or they're afraid to. And we provide the service that lets `em get away with that!I say to hell with it! Let's level with America. Or at least make them speak for themselves! I mean, seriously, what's this... (picks a card off theThink about it. \"Congratulations on your new baby.\" Eh... How bout... \"Congratulations on your new baby... Guess that's it for hanging out. Nice knowing ya, buddy.\"Wait, what's this? Ooh... fancy! Look at this one with all the hearts. Let's open it up. \"Happy Valentine's Day, Sweetheart. I love you.\" Oh that's nice.If someone gave me this card, Mr. Vance... I would eat it.It's these greeting cards, Sir, these cards, these movies, these pop songs. They're responsible for all the lies, the heartache, everything! We're responsible! Everyone shifts in their seats.I think we do a bad thing here. People should be able to say how they feel, how they really feel, without some strangers putting words in their mouths. The truth. A card is a nice thought but it shouldn't do the dirty work for you. You love someone, tell them yourself, in your own words. Maybe it's not love at all. Maybe there's no such thing as love. Maybe it's... \"galoogoo.\" Yeah I made it up, so what?!It's all crap. We make and peddle crap. And sometimes people believe in this crap. I just can't do it anymore, Mr. Vance. There's enough bullshit in the world without my help. I quit.There's no fucking way!It can't be. It's impossible!How do you know?But... It's May! We broke up last August.And you said she was single at Christmas.And now she's...Now she's getting married.Married?It's impossible. It doesn't make sense. Where did they meet? Is it someone we know?So everything she said. All that stuff about... it can't be. Not her. I know her too well. She wouldn't do that.Fuck!I can't believe it either!The right girl I guess.Oh you'd be surprised.Hey I appreciate that Aunt Betsy. Lord knows I like bosoms. It's just... I recently got out of a...well, I don't know what it was.July.What?No. Where's that coming from?Well...glad you came?When you turn 13 in the Jewish religion, you officially become an adult.Pretty big, yeah.You having fun? You were great this morning.Me? I'm good. I'm great.Yeah.Yup.Anyway, who cares about me? This is your day.Is that right?That's nice.Those are guppies.Are you making fun of me now?I got news for you Rach. That true love stuff... it's make-believe.It's the new me.Alright... go play with your friends.Sure.Hmm?Hey.Are you still sleeping?10:30. Are we still hanging out today?I'll meet you at Liberty in... 20 minutes?So how was last night?Where did you guys go?Fun?Pretty standard.It's playing at 5.I don't know. You wanna maybe go back to your place or ---Ok cool.No, I will. That's fine.Hey.Hey Sum, it's just a movie.Is everything alright with you?It's ok. This happens to me every time I watch \"Hoosiers.\" Let's go for a walk, ok. Let's get some air. Or go to Sister Ray's.It pains me that we live in a world where no one's ever heard of Spearmint.And it's painful. Oh look.So... Now what?Yeah? You wanna maybe...get some dinner or something?Are you hungry?Ooh!I've got a great idea!Let's get breakfast.Pancakes?What? Oh. Nowhere. How long have you been sitting there?So... I should probably say congratulations.I don't know if I do honestly.Yeah well...anyway...I hope you're happy.God no.I'm good. Ish.Yeah I quit the office.Mostly...sleeping. Breaking things.So who's the guy?Yeah... Wait. Don't tell me. I don't want to know.No really, I don't.It's amazing to me. You're married.You're not only someone's girlfriend, your someone's wife!I'll never understand that.What's different now? How could things change so quickly?What happened?! That's what I don't get.What, tell me...You know what sucks? Realizing that everything you believe in is complete bullshit.Destiny, soulmates, true love. All that stuff. It's nothing more than silly childhood fairy tale nonsense, isn't it? God!I should have listened to you, Summer. You were right all along.What? This is funny?What are you laughing at?(trying himself not toWhat are you talking about?!This is funny to you?Summer!I really do hope you're happy.Sorry?Oh. Yeah. Why, are you?Ah. My competition.Gee, this is a little awkward.Well, I hope you don't get it.So, uh...Are you from...California?I know Atherton. Nice area.I, uh, don't know. I don't think so.I do! I love that church. It's like my favorite structure in the city.Yes! Exactly. I totally agree!You have? Really? Hmm. I didn't see you.Yes.Thank you.Excuse me.When this is over... uh... would you like to maybe...grab a cup of coffee or something?Oh. Got it... No problem.What's that?Yeah?Great! So...

Like my parents.Oh yeah, And I read in Newsweek, there were these scientists who found that by stimulating a part of the brain with electrodes you can make a person fall in \"love\" with a rock. Is that the love you're talking about?Why, what's your take on it?Ok. Looks like we're gonna have to agree to disagree on that one.I'd say it's your turn loverboy.Sure you do. I see you lip-synching to your headphones every morning on your way in.It's ok. I like it. Takes a lot of self-confidence to look ridiculous.Ok then. Let's drink.Bartender!What is that then?I used to watch it every week.Pathetic.Totally.Is he gonna be ok?Is that true?You know what. Do you...like me?As a friend.Just as a friend?Nothing. I just... You're interesting. I'd like us to be friends. Is that ok?Cool.Well, I'm that way. Good night Tom.Hey!Yes, Mr. Vance?Hi, I'm Summer..Hi Paul.Nice to meet you.Heard what?I'm stalking, STARVING!Sometimes you can be so judgmental.I mean, who are you? They're happy. Just mind your own business.Too soon to say. It's all in the dismount.I can't believe them. I have like zero patience for PDA.Yeah?This is fun. You're fun.I mean, I just want to say, up front, I'm not looking for anything serious.Are you cool with that?It freaks some guys out when I say that.Let's just have fun. Let's just...hang out, no pressure, no labels, no obligations. Ok?Wanna hold my hand under the table?Hi.Complex. Yes.In a way, it speaks so much by saying... so little.God yes!Why?How would you change it?Show me.Don't talk about it. Do it.You wanna --It doesn't matter to me.So how's it going?I remember!This is not at all as easy as it looks.Why not?I told you. I love Ringo.Why?That's what I love about him. Ooh.This got great reviews.Is that... possible?Hi.Are you ok?You sure?Ok.Wait!Whoa. Oh my god. We can't talk during this song. It's too beautiful.People think it looks good.On some.Yeah? What if I started wearing berets and got a huge butterfly tattoo on my leg?Hey.Ok.Yeah not too far.You're not too perceptive.No thank you.Sorry, no thank you.Don't be rude. I'm flattered, I'm just not interested. Now why don't you go back over there and leave us alone, ok?I can't believe you.You were so completely uncool in there.Oh that was for me? You were, what, protecting me? Next time Tommy, don't. I fight my own battles.You didn't have to hit him. Why didn't you just let me handle it?See. This is why I don't want a serious relationship.Nothing. Look, I like you Tom. I like this. What we've been doing. But maybe it's gone too...I told you all along what I don't want and it's...I'm tired. Can we talk about this tomorrow?Hi.Nothing.Tom...Are you almost done?Say you're sorry.Say you're sorry for acting like a jerk.Ok. Me too.I know -I can't promise you that. Nobody can. Anyone who does is a liar.I can only tell you how I feel right now... or I can show you.What?Well... yeah.A few.Oh no way.Cause there's nothing to tell.You wanna have the relationship history conversation?You sure about that?Ok. Well, in high school, there was Markus.He was a rower. Very hot.He works for the Republican party. Very successful. Just not for me.Well, for a short time in college, there was Kurt.That didn't really go anywhere. And... my semester in Rome. Daniele Belardelli. AKA \"The Puma.\"Yeah, cause, you know...The ones that lasted.Nothing happened really. It's what always happens. Life.While you continue to talk about buildings and whatever other bullshit interests you, I'll just nod my head and pretend to listen while secretly dreaming about the many ways I can one day rip out your heart and eat it like the rabid vampire I am.It was good.Hey it's me.I am thank you. Listen, about tonight... I think I might just stay in and go to bed early.I'm just really tired and I've gotta go in early tomorrow. Would you be super mad at me if we went out this weekend instead?I'm not really that hungry. And this place is fancy right?I'd rather not. Seriously, do you mind?Thank you. So we'll talk tomorrow, alright?Great. Good night Tom.Ok I'm sick of this love shit. Come on! We've been fed this nonsense for generations to the point where it's now genetically encoded in our very beings. And what does it mean? Absolutely nothing. Give me a break!It sounds amazing.Exactly.All you take me to are sappy little romances. I want to see some open wounds, damn it. I want carnage.What?You too.Yes we are.Absolutely.It's fine.Did you tell them I was your girlfriend?They seemed to think... I mean, why is your step-dad giving me a hug?Does he hug all your friends?You're not having any fun.I'm dancing. I haven't danced in ages. God. Come on.Come on! I wanna dance with you.So you're pissed?Then why are you here?Yeah well, I didn't need a chaperone. Go home. You're a buzzkill standing there pouting.Tom!Of course. Where am I exactly?Wow. So this is a big day in your sister's life.So why aren't you smiling?Hello?I'm getting up. What time is it?Ok. Sure.I might need 45.It was fine. Just a work thing.Some restaurant.Uneventful. Didn't get home until after 12 though which is way too late for a stupid work function. How was your night?You want to go?I want to see it. Let's go.Unless you don't want to.Ok.I know. I'm sorry Tom.Yeah. I'm just...I'm sorry. I'm being ridiculous.Ok.I've never heard of them.So.Now...I think I'm gonna call it a day.I've got pasta at home.I'm pretty hungry, but --What?What?Now?Hey.Where you coming from?Awhile.I come here a lot. I always loved this place, ever since you brought me here.Probably. But only if you mean it.I understand.You really do?How are you, Tom?That's good.Really? That's great! What are you doing now?Who, my guy?Tom...Ok.I know.Pretty crazy, huh?Tom --I don't know. It just happened.I... Tom...I woke up one day and I knew.I knew I could promise him I'd feel the same way every morning. In a way that I... I never could with you.What is?Tom, don't go.I was right?Tom! You're the crazy person!One day I'm reading a book at the corner deli and this guy sits down and starts asking about it. Now he's my husband!What would have happened if I went to the movies instead? If I went somewhere else for lunch? If I showed up to eat ten minutes later? Tom, it was meant to be, just like you said. And as it was happening, I knew it. I could feel it, sure as the sun. And I kept thinking to myself \"Holy shit. Tom was right.\" You were right about all of it. It just wasn't me you were right about.Anyway, I should probably be getting back. It was good to see you.
