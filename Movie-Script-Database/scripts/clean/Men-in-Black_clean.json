A donde vas? San Antonio? Buscando trabajo, no? Buena suerta. Es un placer verle aqui.Que dices si te rompo la cara?No hablas ni una palabra del Espanol, verdad, amigo?We got a winner. Los restos estan libres a irse. Largense!Tomen el camion, y vayeuse.Don't \"Sir\" me! You have no idea who you're dealing with!We're gonna have a little chat with our friend here. You boys can hit the road ... and keep on protecting us from dangerous aliens.I think you jumped off the bus in the wrong part of town, amigo. In fact, I'll bet dollars to pesos that you're not ---- from anywhere near here.Mikey?! When did they let you out of jail?Political refugee. Right.One, my ass. Try seven.Okay, that's enough. Hand me your head and put up your arms.Ah, shit.Dee! Shoot him!Dee, for Christ's --\"That.\"Human, I know. Oops. Got some entrails on you.Okay, everybody, situation's under control, calm down. If you'll just give me your attention for a moment I'll tell you what happened.This is called a \"neuralyzer.\" A gift from some friends from out of town. The red eye here isolates and measures the electronic impulses in your brain. More specifically, the ones for memory.Gimme a splay burn on the perimeter, please; holes at 40, 60, and 80.Exactly the right question. And the answer lies right -- here. Pay attention.Really? I'm just a figment of your imagination.God, we're a gullible breed.I mean it, fellas, you are lucky to be alive after a blast like that.Underground gas vein, genius. You guys need to exercise more caution before discharging your firearms.Especially you.Happens.What?No. You won't.Some night, huh?They were gills.Not eyelids.Did he say anything to you?Did he say when?Would you recognize his weapon if you saw it again?Let's take a ride.It's all done.You ran that guy down on foot? That's tough. That's double tough.Nothing is what it seems, kid.I'm part of a secret organization that monitors and polices alien activity on earth.Really?Do your \"thing,\" kid. Edwards goes inside.Why don't you show him the imports, Jeebs.The imports, Jeebs. Now.Why do you lie to me? I hate it when you lie.I'm going to count to three.One.Two.Three.I warned him.You warned him.Will you relax?Show us what you got, Jeebs. Or I'll use up another one.Edwards?You sold a carbonizer with implosion capacity to an unlicensed cephlapoid.A carbonizer is an assassin's weapon, Jeebs. Who was the target?Jeebs!This is all confiscated. All of it. I want you on the next transport off this rock. Or I'll shoot you where it doesn't grow back.Searching for a handle on the moment here? A place to file all this.Can't help you, kid. Only comfort I can offer is that tomorrow, you won't remember a thing.Ever see one of these?-- and the wife says yeah, Harry, I know, but this one's eating my popcorn!Whoops. Gotta run. Thanks for the egg rolls.See what I mean about tequila? You're a bright young man, James. Just lay off the sauce. I'll see you tomorrow, nine a.m. sharp.So do I. The guy ran down a cephlapoid, Zed. On foot. Tenacity. That I can use.Back in the mid-fifties, the government started a little underfunded agency with the simple and laughable purpose of making contact with a race not of this planet.Everybody thought the agency was a joke. Except the aliens. They made contact on March 2nd, 1961, outside New York City.There were nine of us that night. Seven agents. An amateur astronomer. And one poor kid who got lost on the wrong back road.They were intergalactic refugees with a simple request. Let us use the earth as an apolitical zone for people without a planet. Ever see \"Casablanca?\" Same thing, no Nazis. We agreed. So we masked all evidence of their landing.Why else would we hold it in Queens? Now left. More nonhumans arrive every year. They live among us, in secret.Every six months; it's company policy.Yeah, sure, hang on, I wanna grab a coffee while we're right here.Don't tell me we've only got that powdered shit for cream again?Oh.For future reference, this is a better look for you.Any given time, around fifteen hundred landed aliens are on the planet, the majority right here in Manhattan. Most aliens are decent enough, just trying to make a living.Not as many as you'd think. Humans, for the most part, don't have a clue. Don't want one, either. They're happy. They think they've got a pretty good bead on things.A person is smart. People are dumb. Everything they've ever \"known\" has been proven to be wrong. A thousand years ago everybody knew as a fact, that the earth was the center of the universe. Five hundred years ago, they knew it was flat. Fifteen minutes ago, you knew we humans were alone on it. Imagine what you'll know tomorrow.What you'll gain in perspective, you'll lose in ways you're too young to comprehend. You give up everything. Sever every human contact. No one will know you exist. Ever.You're not even allowed a favorite shirt. There. That's the speech I never heard. That's the choice I never got.You got 'til sun-up.You find out, you let me know.Cool, slick. Now about those skills of yours,As of this moment, they don't mean much.Let's go. He's a little...grouchy.A couple of hours wait after a 17-light-year flight would get on anybody's nerves.None. They started asking too many questions.Oh, we hold a few patents on gadgets we confiscated from our out-of-state visitors. Velcro. Microwave Ovens. Liposuction.Here. A new recording device to replace CD's. So now I gotta buy the White Album again? This is amusing. Universal translator.We're not supposed to have it. I'll tell you why. Human thought is so primitive it's considered an infectious disease. Makes you proud, doesn't it?Don't touch that!Caused the '77 New York blackout. Practical joke by the Great Attractor. He thought it was funny as hell.Observation, the heart of our little endeavor.This map shows the location of every registered alien on earth at any given time. Some of them we keep under constant surveillance.Everyone on these screens is an alien. In public -- normal. In private -- you'll get the idea.Meet the twins.It makes no sense?Mrs. Edelson.Jupiter, actually. Well, one of the moons.Landed alien out of zone. Who is it?Zed was saving the world before you were born, son. Show some respect.Seat belt.Buckle up, please.Makin' fun of my ride...Jay. The button?Never push the button, Jay.License and registration, please.Other license and registration, please.Your resident card has you restricted to the five boroughs only. Where do you think you're going?Oh God. How soon?Okay. All right. No big deal. You handle it.Sure, it's easy, you just sorta -- catch.Yeah, hell, sure, he does this all the time. C'mon, let him work, Redgick, I wanna ask you something.Croagg the Midwife's back on 64th and 8th. You were headed out of town.So? Who you meeting?Really? I didn't see a departure clearance for today.Doin' fine, Ace. What kind of emergency? What's the rush to get off the planet all of a sudden?What new arrivals? This have anything to do with the crasher from last night?Congratulations! It's a lizard.Anything about that seem unusual to you?What kind of \"new arrival\" would scare Redgick so bad that he'd risk a warp jump with a newborn? Let's check the hot sheets.Best damn investigative reporting on the planet. But hey, go ahead, read the New York Times if you want. They get lucky sometimes.Not looking for. Found.Not so fast. Walk up slow.Part of the routine. Makes it look like we're sizing up the situation. Gives her time to get the wrong impression.Puts some fear into her. Makes things go smoother.How do you do, ma'am, I'm Special Agent Manheim, this is Agent Black, FBI. Had a few questions about your visitor.No ma'am. We at the FBI don't have a sense of humor that we're aware of. Mind if we come in?Go on.Did he say anything?Sugar water.Ray Bans. Okay, Beatrice. There was no alien, and the flash of light you saw in the sky wasn't a UFO. Swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted the light from Venus --Standard issue neuralyzer.On a more personal note, Beatrice, Edgar ran off with on old girlfriend. Go stay at your mother's for a few days and get over it. Decide you're better off.When you're ready. Please -- not green.Do you know what alien life form leaves a green spectral trail?Zed, we have a bug.Bugs thrive on carnage, Tiger. They consume, infest and destroy. They live off the death and decay of other species.Listen, kid -- imagine a giant cockroach five times smarter than Albert Einstein, four times stronger than an ox, nine times meaner than hell, strutting his stuff around Manhattan Island in his brand new Edgar suit. Does that sound like fun?With a bug in town? Watch the morgues.Weird? Dr. Leo Menville, Department of Public Health. This is Dr. White.We watch the morgues very carefully. You've got something unusual?I'll have a look at this one. Dr. White, why don't you and Dr. Weaver check out the other body?What do you think?Of the body.The dead body?All right. Keep her occupied. Try not to sound too dumb.You're up, Slugger.Rosenberg. Damn. Good man.One of the few I actually liked. Exiled High Prince.He said there's a galaxy on Orion's Belt? That makes no sense.Sure thing, sweetheart. Here you go.Typical day, too much caffeine, get a life.Never hurt her before.Couple.Little bit.I took this job.Nah.Not while I'm around, Slim.We've got two dead aliens in there, and a deputy medical coroner in need of a new memory.No.Try it.They're leaving.Why do rats desert the ship? Go to Lem Sat IV. Put up a forty-field view of Manhattan.Four hundred.Four thousand.That's an Arquillian battle cruiser.Message coming in.Speak of the devil.Series four de-atomizer.Here. We call this the \"Noisy Cricket.\"Someone who's not looking for jewels.Damn it.We do not discharge our weapons in view of the public.There's always an Alien Battle Cruiser...or a Korlian Death Ray, or...an intergalactic plague about to wipe out life on this planet, and the only thing that lets people get on with their hopeful little lives is that they don't know about it.Don't worry about the bug. He's not leaving town. We've got his ship.Zed, we're gonna need a containment crew down here at McDougal, south of Houston.What about the Arquillians?No, they don't want much, do they?All right, kid. The Arquillians want the galaxy, whatever the hell that means. We need help. A professional. Someone with years of experience in intergalactic politics. I just hope the little prick hasn't skipped town.You busy, Frank?Call the pound. We got a stray.Arquillians and bugs. What do you know?Not a thing?And the bug had other plans.Rosenberg said something about a galaxy on \"Orion's belt.\" What's he talking about, Frank?Here?How small?Get out of here. The galaxy's here. It's not on Orion's belt.By killing the emissaries, and stealing the galaxy they've been fighting about.We're not even history. 'Cause history implies there's someone around to remember it.What the hell for?Two minutes!Freeze it, Bug!Let her go, Shit Eater.You're breakin' my heart. Move six inches to your left and I'll solve all your problems.How far you think you'll get without your ship? If that's what you call that hunk of space crap we've got back at our office.Never gonna happen, Insect.Damn it!Stop wasting time. He's not getting off the planet in a cab.Come with me. Put up a bio-net all the way around Manhattan; if it's not human, it's not leaving the island.What've we got from our friends upstairs?Yeah, well the bug's got the galaxy, but we've got his ship. He's got to be looking for a way out.One hour.Pull up the locations of all land-based interstellar vehicles.Atlantic City?That landfill on the Jersey Shore?Epcot?Miami Beach?Hartford?Whaddya say we bag us some bug?You know a better way to Queens?Jay. The button?Push the button, Jay.And you may want to throw on a seat belt.Mind if I smoke?In the car, I mean.Hey, just a common courtesy. It bothers some people if you smoke in a car.Yeah, it's harder and harder to smoke anywhere these days. Hell, I suppose I should quit. I've tried. Never took, though. I'm beginning to think I lack self-control.Well, back to work.No idea whatsoever.Let's bag us some bug.Set it to pulsar level five, sub-sonic implosion factor --Press the little green button, on three.One...two...You are under arrest for violating number 4-1-53 of the Tycho accord. Please hand over any galaxy you might be carrying.Move away from the vehicle and put your hands on your head.This guy's really starting to bug me.Whatever happens, Jay, don't let him get on that ship.Getting my gun back.Hey, Bug!I'm talking to you, Bug! You know how many of your kind I've swatted with a newspaper?You're just a smear on the sports page to me, you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal parasite! Eat me!Zed. Get a message to the Arquillians. We have the galaxy.You were saying?Worked.And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.There wasn't time, sport!Not her. Me. They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.Maybe you won't have to.Days. Months. Years.
