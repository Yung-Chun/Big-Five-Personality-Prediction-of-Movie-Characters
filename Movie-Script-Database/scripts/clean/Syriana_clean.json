MSA seems remarkably serene, then he screams in Arabic.You don't speak Farsi, do you, you son of a goat? MSA screams again, tightening his finger on the trigger, then he backs out the door, never losing aim on Bob.Those people back there don't know what's going on. They don't wanna know.And it's not like anybody else could roll in here. It's not like it's just reading reports.Well, then here we are.Let's say, somehow, I get a Branch or even a Group, then what? Will you come? Will you bring Robby? Now, Margaret looks away. A STUDENT-LEADER is up on a platform brandishing a Coke bottle, SHOUTING in Farsi into a bullhorn.He's against the ban on Coca-Cola. He says you have to fix your soul, which is not something you can put on a soft-drink. We see the faces of the protesters, silently staring, their mouths covered by black tape.And our analysis seems to be on the mark... And we're getting good satellite coverage. Bob is clearly working from a script. Terry George is pleased and gives Bob the slightest of approving nods.And we're reprogramming resources into Iran. Our next review will show that ---It's possible. It's complicated.They let young people march in the street and then the next day shut down fifty newspapers. They have a few satellite dishes up on roofs, let 'em have My Two Dads, but that doesn't mean the Ayatollahs have relinquished one iota of control over that nation. The steno guys hands are frozen.We've had Iran in embargo for almost thirty years, we backed their neighbor, a neighbor we invaded twice, in a ten year war against them, we're hanging on by a thread with a massive occupation force, so I got news for you... Thomas Jefferson just ain't that popular over there right now. Silence except for the steno guys clicking away, then complete silence. Terry George stares at Bob a long beat.How's your mom?she's a secretary.She was a secretary.Robby, you know, I live... Where do I live? Maryland. I live in Maryland. Meaning you have residency there. In Maryland. For the University. Of Maryland. Robby liberally uses the hot sauce. Two LEBANESE MEN at another table nod in approval. Robby fires off Arabic.Robby, it's complicated. I may have really screwed up at work.I was supposed to keep my mouth shut and didn't. Robby is disappointed and angry.She's a secretary. Robby turns back to the Arab men --Intelligence work isn't training seminars and little gold stars for attendance.It's two people in a room and one of them is asking a favor that's a capital crime in every country on earth. A hanging crime. Another corner. Another white hallway.Prince Nasir Al-Subaai.It's a great city. Everybody chuckles.Did you see my report on the missile? I reset guidance to blow ten feet off the ground --We're not getting divorced. Stan looks at him like he's kidding himself.What about this C.L.Z. - Committee to Liberate Iran?My goal was always to own a bar in Macau, before Macau got ruined like everywhere else.I'm not doing anything sitting in that office. That's the problem. Bourbon rocks -- Bob glances up at the TV. ON TV: financial news, BRYAN WOODMAN in front of the trading floor at his company.Stan, I got a chance to go back. I want to go back. Is it safe for me?How can you tell if you're talking to a Shiite or a Sunni Muslim.I'm here to see Said Hashimi. They roughly frisk Bob.Hashimi. Said Hashimi. They take his pen, remove his belt, check his passport: it's Canadian. Bob's picture. The name is SEYMOUR RISEN. They check his license: the name is SEYMOUR RISEN.Thank you for this audience. I have a business proposal for Mussawi. One that benefits everyone. Hashimi nods magisterially.I thought it would also be prudent to say, I have no interest in Hezbollah. This is business and it doesn't concern Hezbollah. In the distance a dog barks and chickens cluck. After a beat, Hashimi turns his rheumy eyes on Bob.Yeah, sure. Only one of them was propelled by gas and the other byHe saw an engine coming at him at 27,000 feet per second and his heart stopped. This settles a beat.I'm between State Department and Defense. Bob surreptitiously looks around to see if Mussawi is alone. It's clear Bob makes him nervous as well.I'm getting some information, Jimmy.Okay, Jimmy. Mussawi glances down at the picture. It surprises him. ANGLE on the picture of PRINCE NASIR crossing a street. Bob has a small pad on which he scribbles a dollar figure. Mussawi glances at the number. He's impressed.I want you to drug him, put him in the front of a car and run a truck into it at fifty miles an hour.Canadian. Nasir motions for them to squeeze together for Bob. The gate closes. The lift creaks and begins to rise.Yes.Yes. Bob is framed by two, not-bright CIA SECURITY OFFICERS.Yes.Of course I was aware. It's why I went after them.what do you think?I'm okay. I'm fine. Hey --I saw these Shiites selling an Egyptian a missile. In Iran. I had a feeling about this guy, a Sunni nut-job, but I'm back here where I got on the wrong side of Terry, then an opportunity just happened to come up involving someone I worked with before, not a radical, I mean, he went to Rutgers, only now he flips, wants to cut my goddamn head off. And now they got me isolated away in here and they send these suits around asking me nonsense questions about bad people who are no longer with us, no longer with us on their goddamn orders. So you tell me what happened. You tell me, Margaret. Margaret doesn't know what to say so she says nothing.What about Fred?Fred. Fred turns and sees Bob, looks around uncomfortably.What's going on, Fred?I was almost killed, Fred. My hands were mutilated. And they're asking me about the Amiri brothers? About Tehran?I typed in Prince Nasir Al-Subai and my computer gets seized.Where did this Prince Nasir job come from? Why was I tortured. Why am I being investigated? Why was I sent? NEIGHBORS stare. Fred's kids look out the window.Stan, why did Mussawi double-cross me? Why does no one care that a Sunni radical named Mohammed Sheik Agiza has our missile? And why did they open a damage assessment on the Amiris? And on me. For doing my job?What about Mussawi?Did Prince Nasir hide Mohammed Sheik Agiza in the Water Ministry? Does he fund terrorist organizations?Who's worried about the Nasir job? Stan, who's worried about me talking? On the screen: a LOUD, ACTION BEAT. Stan leans over andYou were in Beirut in '84.I didn't used to need to know. A Grand Slam Breakfast is set in front of Bob.Bacon looks perfect, Deborah. Bob puts syrup on the pancakes. Eats a piece of bacon.Innocent until investigated. That's nice. It has a nice ring to it. I bet you've worn some miles on little sayings like that. Very wise, gives the listener the sense of law being written as it's spoken.If anything happens to me or my family, an accident, an accusation, anything, then first your son will disappear, his body will never be found. Then your wife. Her body will never be found either. This is guaranteed. Then, whatever is the most dangerous thing you do in your life, it might be flying in a small plane, it might be walking to the bank, you will be killed.I've made decisions that resulted in deaths, but I never lost a nights sleep. Never. I killed people, but I always had about 500 pages of U.S. law behind me, law that I believed in, and that was good enough.I want my passports back.If I told you I knew of something that was going to happen to someone and that I felt I had to try and stop it even though it will probably cost me my job, what would you say?

Julie puts four plates down. They both notice the empty place setting. Just then, a golden boy, MAX, 6, enters the kitchen.Our position is that there is at least twelve dollars of instability premium in the market. Protests in Iran. Threat of more strikes in Venezuela. The Turks still making noise about Russian crude through the Bosphorus.That's a very good job to have.I can't. I've got all this --It's Max's birthday. We've got stuff all weekend.

Julie looks at her husband to determine whether he's testing his \"pitch\" or in need of encouragement.Here? They nod. Bryan looks around. It's awkward.Well, okay... The real worry facing you guys is another year of record pricing. There are no more elephant fields. Not even in Natural Gas. As structural alternatives are more fully realized you'll need a new strategy to maximize every penny from your existing resources, particularly in a climate of falling prices. One businessman turns to the other --That minister eulogizing our child made me sick. How do you eulogize a child? He was great at playing. He loved popsicles. She rolls into him and he holds her, but he's staring at the ceiling as the child's cries echo down the hallway.If on Monday Khatami refuses the I.A.E.A. inspectors, look for crude prices to spike yet again.

Because of trade restrictions and outdated alliances, you've been selling your gas for peanuts, loading it on ships, and waving as it sails away.

They're thinking we're running out. We're running out and ninety percent of what's left is in the Middle East. So if you look at the whole progression from Versailles, through Suez, 1973, Gulf War One, Gulf War II, it's really shaping up as a fight to the death.so what they're thinking is keep playing, keep buying your toys, keep spending fifty thousand dollars a night for your hotel room, but don't invest in your infrastructure, don't build a real economy, so when you finally wake up, they will have sucked you dry and you will have squandered the greatest natural resource in history.

Again, the leader speaks in rapid Russian.I'm asking you about this payment. Who is this person on the account? Bennett notices a Russian, OSKAR WERNER-TYPE, wearing THICK-FRAMED GLASSES, smoking and staring at him. Another RUSSIAN glances at the paperwork.I know bank is no more. I'm trying to find out where the assets went. The Russians nod to the MUSIC coming from the poles. Now the leader speaks in surprisingly good English.Provided the government approves the merger --I know him. He taught a class of mine at Georgetown Law. Sydney knew this, of course.

English? Does anyone here speak Russian? The paralegals just stare. Someone in the back shouts --Take this to Sydney Hewitt. Now.Killeen Oil through Daniel Dalton and PetroKa Energy Consultants created assetless shell companies owned by the heirs of President Nazerbayev. This was. discussed... At the Upstream Division Meeting held in January of 2003 in Sun Valley, Idaho?Wherein it was described that Killeen bore all financial risk, but President Nazerbayev's children, while attending The Lily School in Switzerland, were entitled to all of the profits - seventy million dollars. Tommy's personal lawyer leans in and whispers in his ear.Daniel Dalton Jr. and PetroKa Energy Consultants --A good faith purchaser is in good faith only if they didn't know about the problems at the time of the purchase --It is illegal to offer gifts, money or the promise of money or anything of value to influence foreign officials --The business of Whiting, Sloan is not under discussion at this time.You broke the law, Mr. Dalton.You have 37 million dollars hidden away and the only question I can see of any relevance is whether you'll get to keep any of it. The two men are tiny against the architecture, the nation's capitol going on with it's day around them.He has kids. He's got a wife.I do, Don. Very well.That's quite a statement, Don.One word. Dalton.Defrauded the Government of Kazakhstan of funds to which it was entitled, defrauded the people of Kazakhstan of the right to the honest services of their elected and appointed officials. Seven years, does three, maybe two point seven, on your recommendation. out the window the bad neighborhood is giving way back to the developing neighborhood where Bennett lives.Dalton's a bit of a rogue, it's true.Not so little, I imagine.What are you doing?Really. Well, I'll tell you what I'm not doing: I'm not running a shelter. You going back to work? No answer.What happened at your job anyway? Another jerk? Another white asshole? What? You think you get where I've gotten and there are less of them? You think I don't want a fucking drink? You have no idea what I'm doing, what is actually going on with me. The only way you can change this shit, all this shit, is from the inside. I'm trying to get inside. Which a fucking loser like you will never understand. Bennett Sr. puts down, his paper, stubs out his cigarette and starts for the door.Good. The door shuts behind his dad --I love this country. It's a great country, if you're not a quitter.Dalton's not enough. So they will sit on him until he explains the how and why and the who, and they will be forced to unravel this merger. Jimmy turns from the grill.Dalton's not enough.If he's as big as you say then when he goes down the merger will be approved. Despite himself, Jimmy is impressed --We're looking for the illusion of due-diligence. Two criminal acts successfully prosecuted gives us that illusion. Jimmy hands Bennett a plate of ribs and smiles.The lawyers are saying, hey, if you can't trust a Big Five accounting firm. And the accountants are saying, hey, we're not lawyers. Legal didn't understand. Accounting didn't understand. Nobody understood anything. The regulatory bodies had to scratch their heads for a minute that nobody at Connex or Killeen was at fault, but this merger is so balance-positive for American consumers that ultimately Justice wants it, the Federal court wants it. Everybody wants it. Our real client is US, the American people, and we're building our presence in Kazakhstan, so we had to give them a little something meaningful and they got out of our way. Mr. Janus glances at the TV where a pro golfer sinks a long, undulating putt.Unfortunately, yes. And the best option seemed to be a secret deal for excess Iranian pipeline capacity that I uncovered during the diligence, a side deal benefiting the lead lawyer involved in the Connex-Killeen merger approval process.

He stares, then slowly pulls back from the scope.My granddaddy was a wildcatter. Same with my daddy. That's how I got my start. Luck and hard work. Nobody handed me shit. Now, I got libraries and parks named after me. And I'll probably ruin the grand-kids. You wearing a wire, Bennett?Mind if I pat you down? Jimmy checks for a recording device. He's clean.We all tell ourselves little stories, Bennett. Sometimes I'm the flame burning in the Jefferson Memorial. Other times I'm a guy with his nose pressed up against the windows of a whorehouse -- Suddenly there's a RUSTLING as a large animal passes somewhere close. Bennett freezes. Jimmy looks at him.Boar.What'd your daddy do, Bennett?Oh, fer Chrissakes, Tommy, we both got letters from the Grand Jury, it's not your own private little pity party --The lowliest little shareholder knows we deal with some of the most stank places on earth --Oh, is it? I have personally seen a bill from this law firm to the government of Saudi Arabia for 36 million dollars. A one line bill for services rendered.Well, it oughta be. Danny's a good man.

Polite LAUGHTER.And allow me to introduce my associate, Bennett Holiday, who will be, how should I put it, building consensus day to day. Bennett, the only African-American in the room, takes in the faces now all staring at him. All the white faces.You just visited what someday soon could be the most profitable corporation in America.Provided we don't start running cars on water. Provided there's still chaos in the Middle-East.This ain't the SEC anymore, son, and maybe you got a couple scalps on your belt from your time over there - Enron, World Com - but now the job is find the problem, fix the problem. And if you don't find a problem, then there is no problem. Bennett notices that Sydney wears a Mickey Mouse watch.And WHEN the government approves this merger it's gonna buy a lot of houses out on the Vineyard, maybe even yours, so, of course, it's delicate all around. Who's this U.S. Attorney, Donald Farish the 3rd? What's his agenda? Who's behind him? Is it a political force? Another corporation? Is he a glory boy making a name?Well, there you go, he taught a class of yours at Georgetown Law. Mr. .Whiting did say to me, I have a feeling about this young man. He said, he can position himself. Sydney stands.Hold these guys in a circle. Ask the careful questions. I don't need to tell you this is a hell of an opportunity for you to catch those peers who have spent, how should I put it, less time on the government dole.I took a bit of a temperature reading. The other associates seem to like you. That's not really a good sign.Six apiece.Inherited a ton of dough -- Point.Seven.- Six. Already got his mind made up. Got his teeth in it like a little terrier. As Sydney is talking, he wins the point.Eight - Six. Match point.Like an informant?Match! He turns and holds out his hand.If people in oil deals talked to U.S. Attorneys, there'd be no oil business. DEAN WHITING, 60's, congenial, but powerful in build, an ex-marine, an insider for forty years, wanders over.Dean, you know Bennett Holiday.We've been discussing the Connex- Killeen merger situation.How'd it go? Think you'll get invited on any more hunting trips?He broke the law. Sydney holds out a golden envelope to Bennett.Mr. Janus himself wanted me to extend an invitation to oilman of the Year. He's being honored so it should be a nice weekend. Relax. Get a massage. Congratulations. Perhaps the slightest flicker of distaste crosses Bennett's face. On the reverse the Capitol Building is so close you could reach out and touch it.His wife'll be there. Pat. Butter wouldn't melt in her mouth. The elevator TONES on every floor.This is good. You done good. The watch the floors light up.What do you think you're doing?Stop. Right. Now. Bennett and Mr. Janus look at Sydney.In our line of work, the guy with the documents is usually the guy who stole the documents.You aren't going to hurt me, Bennett. You'll wash out of the private sector. Fact, you're already gone. You'll end up working public defender cases. You'll make 1/50th the money. You could have been on the boards of Fortune Five Hundred companies. You could have been an advisor to Presidents. You could have helped us win like Romans instead of sitting on the sidelines hoping we don't turn into Visigoths.Don. Not the perp walk, Don -- Farish nods as if to acknowledge they're barely out of round one. And they begin leading Sydney out. Across the room, silhouetted by the windows, Mrs. Janus helps Mr. Janus slip on his tux jacket. They see Bennett standing awkwardly in the middle of the room. Pat extends her hand for him to join them.", "clean_line": "way feel like switzerland like remind room ve signed confidentiality agreements polite laughter allow introduce associate bennett holiday building consensus day day bennett african american room takes faces staring white faces visited someday soon profitable corporation america provided start running cars water provided chaos middle east ain sec anymore son maybe got couple scalps belt time enron world com job problem fix problem problem problem bennett notices sydney wears mickey mouse watch government approves merger gonna buy lot houses vineyard maybe course delicate attorney donald farish rd agenda political force corporation glory boy making taught class georgetown law mr whiting feeling young man said position sydney stands hold guys circle ask careful questions need tell hell opportunity catch peers spent time government dole took bit temperature reading associates like good sign apiece inherited ton dough point seven got mind got teeth like little terrier sydney talking wins point match point like informant match turns holds hand people oil deals talked attorneys oil business dean whiting congenial powerful build ex marine insider years wanders dean know bennett holiday ve discussing connex killeen merger situation think ll invited hunting trips broke law sydney holds golden envelope bennett mr janus wanted extend invitation oilman year honored nice weekend relax massage congratulations slightest flicker distaste crosses bennett face reverse capitol building close reach touch wife ll pat butter wouldn melt mouth elevator tones floor good good watch floors light think stop right bennett mr janus look sydney line work guy documents usually guy stole documents aren going hurt bennett ll wash private sector fact gone ll end working public defender cases ll th money boards fortune companies advisor presidents helped win like romans instead sitting sidelines hoping turn visigoths perp walk farish nods acknowledge barely round begin leading sydney room silhouetted windows mrs janus helps mr janus slip tux jacket bennett standing awkwardly middle room pat extends hand join"}, "PRINCE NASIR": {"raw_line": "My father has ordered the Marbella estate to be razed.There will be a park. To lose a first born son... Nasir doesn't know what to say.A house main was run in the wrong place. The covering for the wiring had deteriorated. Bryan just stares at him.You're very angry. I understand.We begin the process of empowering a new generation of Arabs with the skills and training necessary to succeed globally... Bryan claps dutifully. But he's on the phone, the cord dangling from ear to Blackberry which reads \"work.\"our 13 point document is an agreement on principles calling for greater political freedom, good governance and transparency, advanced civil liberties and human rights, women's rights, and judicial reforms. Bryan's phone vibrates again - JULIE HOME. He turns the phone off.However, unlike Washington's Greater Middle East Initiative, we respect each country's right to move at its own pace. APPLAUSE. One leader after another solemnly shake hands with Nasir as a photographer records the moment.Everything as scheduled. Nasir looks out the window. He switches to English for Bryan but is speaking more to himself.Respect the right to move at their own pace. Respect the right to do nothing is more like it. Except condemn Israel and strengthen the conservative religious movements.American?Don't see many Occidentals these days. Bob doesn't say anything.It's too bad. Bob nods again. As the elevator moves higher more light floods in through the wire mesh. Bob's eyes meet Nasir's.Some people, cousins of mine actually, sued my father in The Commonwealth alleging that he broke agreements to repay funds transferred from the State. Bryan follows Nasir. He glances at a photo of AGGRIEVED ARABS leaving court with DEAN WHITING looking protective.Aggrieved Royals. Aggrieved about what? That he tried to cut their allowances from one hundred thousand a month to eighty. They pass wife, children, hangers-on. Room after room.There are 300 years of corrupt layers in the middle-east and you have to break the ice. There must be structural changes. I tell them, with just one of your boats you could revolutionize Yemen, build desalinization plants. The man with the 200 foot boat needs a 250 foot boat. The man with 250. now needs 300. They dead-end in a small office. The Emir's JAPANESE SECRETARY half-rises.I want to see my father. The secretary shakes his head. Nasir is furious.My cousins aren't bright enough to be anything but finger-puppets. My brother has faith only in his own cunning. Then again, what should I expect, his mother was a whore. And he's hired American lawyers.Come with me, please.I studied at Oxford. I have a PHD from Georgetown. I want to create a parliament. I want to give women the right to vote. I want an independent Judiciary. I want, to start a new petroleum exchange in the Middle-east and cut the speculators out of the business. why are the major oil exchanges in New York and London anyway? I'll put all of our energy up for competitive bidding, I'll pipe through Iran to Europe like you proposed, I'll ship to China, anything that achieves efficiency and maximizes profits for my people, profits which I'll then use to rebuild my country.Exactly, except your President calls my father, says, I've got unemployment in Texas, Kansas, Washington State. One phone call later we're stealing out of our social programs to buy overpriced airplanes. We owed the Americans, but we've repaid that debt.I accepted a Chinese bid, the highest bid. And suddenly I'm a terrorist. I'm a Godless communist. Nasir hopes takes the newspaper out of Bryan's hand.Dean Whiting. Tight on: Dean Whiting with the aggrieved royals.Who represents not only these aggrieved royals but also Connex Oil. They're pressuring my father to invalidate the Chinese contracts. They underestimate him. This is about his legacy to his people.Who will be Emir? The Emir looks away, then back at Prince Nasir.You cannot do this. He is barely qualified to run a brothel much less a country.I cannot do that.Twenty seven tribes in my country and we all hate each other. My father arrested the malcontents. He crushed the religious zealots. Try reasoning with people who have one foot in the afterlife, he said, as he leveled village after village. Another angle and Bryan is approaching. Behind him is the desert house made mainly of tents and sails. DIGNITARIES wait on the deck and watch Nasir.For centuries Islam has been ruled by people with no respect for law, monopolies handed out for the things that people want, commerce stifled, young people unable to find jobs, critics jailed or put to death, women are second-classThis is true. My father is ill and weak and unwilling to fight the Americans. But others are willing. And when a country has five percent of the world's population but does fifty percent of its military spending, then the persuasive powers of that country are on the decline. The crowd is unmoved. Rallying the men will not be easy.The Middle-East and the Arab people have seen empires come and go in six millennia. The Pax Romana, the Pax Ottomanica, the Pax Brittanica, were nothing more than invasions and occupations that ended... The Pax Americana will end, too. His wife and daughters proudly watch.We have endless patience for history, but a man starving to death while sitting on a chair made of gold can no longer afford to be patient. The time for democratic, Arab self- determination has arrived. The crowd CHEERS. And as Prince Nasir, his family and supporters move toward the vehicles, find Nasir's BODYGUARD whispering into a cell phone --I remember you. You're the Canadian. Tight on Bob.
