{"Take-Shelter": {"CURTIS": {"raw_line": "No, no, no...Don't feed the dog darlin'. Hannah immediately picks the piece of toast back up and feeds it to the dog. Samantha brings the pan over and spoons eggs out on everyone's plates.Thanks babe.Yeah. I need to go. What you got going today?Tell Nat to take it easy on her. Curtis gets up and goes to Hannah.Just write the check, babe. Okay.Yeah, let's keep going with that bit! It'll go another 10 feet! He yells to DEWART , a big guy sitting at the controls of a diesel powered WELL-DRILLING RIG. The truck has a long rusted bed with metal scaffolding raised HIGH on its back.Why not?!Happy hour starts at five Dewart!Oh, yeah.Yeah. All right...All right! I'm callin' it! Shut it down! Dewart gladly eases back on the lever at his knee.I gotta get home.What's big?Shit man. The laughing subsides.I don't see me and Sam gettin' into somethin' like that.Well. It ain't always so easy.Good night. Nat, in a house robe and slippers, weaves her way through the maze of junk on their front lawn. Dewart passes her without saying a word. Curtis watches as she follows him inside the house, still talking. He shifts into drive and pulls away.She do all right today?I'll get to it this weekend. It's quiet for a moment.I still take off my boots so I won't wake her up. She smiles up at her husband.What?Nothing. I just want her to eat her breakfast and stop playin' with the damn dog.Hannah. Come here. Hannah.What? He stops and checks his watch.I'm late.It's okay. Curtis is gone. Samantha looks at Hannah on the floor with the dog.Yesterday slowed us down. We couldn't get the second pilot hole drilled. Jim drops his head and the clipboard falls to his side. A melodramatic move.Yes sir.Hey, I gotta make a stop before we head out there.Yeah. There's time.Sonofabitch. Dewart jumps down from the control panel to take a look.Yeah. Well, bring it up. We gotta re-set it. Dewart walks back to his controls. Curtis heads to the cab of the drilling rig and checks his watch.Shit. Something catches his eye in the distance. Clearing past the rig, he walks out into the adjacent field. He removes his goggles, eyes fixed on the acres of farmland that stretch for miles in front of him. In the sky overhead,You ever see birds fly like that?!Ah, Jesus. I could really use a shower.I am sorry. She looks to Hannah and signs, \"swim\".I think I smell good. She smiles, begrudgingly, and then signs to Hannah, \"Dad\" and \"stink\". Curtis turns to some ladies behind him.Do I smell good? Samantha laughs and tries to cover his mouth with her hand.See. Maybe I should marry her instead. They continue to laugh.You okay? She nods. He cranks the truck and turns on the wipers. The liquid on the windshield streaks into long smudges. Curtis leans forward to get a better view of the street. He checks his blind spot and pulls away.Are you okay? Hannah physically looks all right, but she continues crying. Curtis reaches out and places a hand on her head. He's dazed, mumbling.You're okay. The truck is angled up slightly like the front end has inched up a pole. A cut on his forehead has begun to bleed. He sees movement. A PERSON passes by the hazy side window. A SHAPE moves past the driver's window. The truck shifts as weight is added to the bed. The SOUND of SOMEONE pulling things from the back of the truck. A moment. WHACK! Curtis flinches as a 2X4 pounds the windshield. The truck jostles from the weight of someone jumping on the hood. Bump. Bump. The roof caves in with two FOOTSTEPS. Curtis looks around frantically. He reaches over to Hannah and begins to unstrap her from the car seat.Hannah! Hannah! Hands claw at Curtis' face. Scratching. Blood streaks. The Woman has disappeared into the storm with Hannah. Curtis screams. Fingers swoop into his open mouth, grabbing hold of his cheek. They pull the cheek back. TEARING. He yells in pain.I've felt better.Where you goin'?Oh. Yeah. Curtis walks to the table and takes a seat.I'm all right. It's just a cold or somethin'.No. Don't worry about it. Ya'll just go. I'll be fine.Yeah. Better already. Samantha walks to her purse on the counter and roots through to find a set of keys.I'll be all right.Honey, please.Red! Come on.Get in. Red walks into the pen.Good boy. Curtis closes the gate, kneels and places his hands on the fence. Red approaches so that his nose is touching Curtis' fingers. Curtis scratches him.I'm sorry about this buddy. We just gotta work it like this for awhile okay? Curtis stands, wiping his hands off on his jeans. He sees the Storm Shelter poking up from behind the trash pile. He looks down at Red. Curtis walks to the Shelter. Clearing past the trash pile, the shelter appears, the mound fully visible. Curtis stops at the angled doors. He studies them. A rusted padlock is snapped shut across the handles. He reaches out and lifts up the padlock. He yanks on it, then lets it fall.I just wanted him to be outside for awhile.He's my dog, and that's why he's outside. Right now with Hannah and everything I just think it'd be better.Hold on. Curtis stares at the television program. Samantha's eyes narrow. Frustrated, she flips open her magazine.You hearin' this? Her nose still in the magazine.Eleven hours. No way out. Samantha shakes her head. Curtis watches the footage of Walter Jacobs. He watches his red rimmed eyes. The deep lines in his face.Hannah. Hannah doesn't move. She continues staring out the window. The SOUND of the storm outside intensifies. Windows begin to rattle in their frames. Curtis walks over and reaches for Hannah but is startled by the sight of a MAN'S FACE just outside the window. Hannah and the Man have been staring at one another. The Man, hollow eyed and pale, moves out of the window and out of sight.Hey! Thunder CRACKS overhead. Curtis scoops Hannah into his arms and heads out of the room. BANG. The front door rattles. Curtis stops and turns back. BANG. BANG. The SOUND of someone kicking at the front door. The storm outside has grown to a deafening pitch. The power goes out. The entire house vibrates, like a freight train running across the roof. The BANGING at the front door continues, frame giving way, as the STORM reaches its apex. Curtis, holding Hannah, kneels and braces himself in the entryway to the den. He covers the back of Hannah's head with his hands and squeezes her tight into his shoulder. Then Silence. A stillness. The rain stops. No more banging at the front door. The SUN moves brightly though the front windows.Babe?You got the number for Dr. Shannan? She turns.Yeah, but you got the number?Right. Yeah. I'll call tomorrow.No. Stop! She's taken aback.Shit...I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just I got a sore throat. I'm sorry I'm taking it out on you.It's fine. I'll be fine.Come on. Just go.I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Just go.We're going out. Confused, she slices her finger down an open palm.We're going out. Okay? It's okay.You stay put okay? Hannah begins looking through the book. Curtis stands, he sees a set of computers under a sign reading, \"CATALOGUE\".I know. I'm sorry. I had to run an errand.I know.Was it a good service?I'm thinking about cleaning up that storm shelter out back. They look at him.Hey Doc.She's good.I don't have a cold. The Doctor pauses and turns to check a chart on the table.No, I just told her that.I've been havin'...I've been having some trouble sleepin'. I was hopin' you could give me somethin' for it. Doctor Shannan takes a seat on a rolling stool and processes the request.`Bout four nights now.Well some, but real restless.Well, I think... Curtis isn't sure how much he wants to say.I think I may need to try some medication.Yeah. Couple days before that I had a dream that my dog attacked me and it took all day for the pain in my arm to go away. Doctor Shannan leans his back against the table and thinks about this.It's been about a month. He tears two sheets off and holds the first out to Curtis.Okay.All right.Hey Dewart!Not much. Curtis kneels at the ground beside the rig. Sifts dirt through his fingers.Yeah, we'll get it done. Weekend all right?What's the co-pay?Hey. She squeezes him. Then kisses him.I love you too.It's great. It's great.You excited? Huh? We're gonna get you some help. Curtis touches his finger to her chest then stops. He can't think of the sign. He turns to Samantha.How do you say...sign excited?Excited. Yeah? Hannah nods. He kisses her on the forehead. He picks up a crayon and holds it up to her lips like lipstick.Now I got to do you.What's the rent?That sounds real nice. Samantha keeps flipping through the magazine as Curtis heads to the bathroom.Yeah. I did.You want me to come there and do it for you? Jesus. Curtis steadies the large metal piece as Dewart ratchets it down.Hey, how much food do you think you'd need to live on for a week?I mean to stay alive. What do you think you'd need?You think?I've never heard of that.It's on there. It's on. Come on.Dammit.It sounds like thunder.Hey Mom. Her eyes light up and she wraps her arms around Curtis.Sure. She leads him inside.I'm going to get some water. He fills his glass at the sink. Takes a sip.You want some?Mom?I need to ask you somethin'. She looks at him. Totally open.Do you remember what year we brought you up here? To the first place. She has to think about it.It was `86.I was 10.Can you remember what happened before you got diagnosed?I mean...I just want to know how it all started. Before you had to leave. Sarah settles in her chair, understanding the question.Did you ever have any dreams? Like bad dreams.It's all right. It's all right. It's fine. Sarah looks up and smiles. Her focus shifts back to her son.Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine. Sarah looks back down to Hannah's photo.May I have the number for Doctor George Shannan?Hi, is Doctor Shannan there? May I speak with him? This is Curtis LaForche.Oh, hey. Sorry I woke you up.I went to see mom. Samantha sits up in the bed.Mmm hmm. I just wanted to check up on her.That's okay. Samantha lays back down, tucking herself under the covers.I will in a bit. Curtis finishes emptying his pockets.We've been good about that. Myers nods, but he carries a look of concern. He confides.That's fine. Myers sits back, drawing the pen to his lips and tapping it.I need the money John. Myers nods, then leans forward and clicks the pen.Hey.Sorry I left you yesterday.Thanks.Sure.You need another burner?You think you could help me with somethin'?I'm gonna build out the tornado shelter in my backyard. I could use some help.Just needs to be done. Dewart eyes him, unsure.I figure I'll do it on Saturday, borrow some equipment from work.I just need a backhoe, a hauler. I'll rent the rest. Dewart stares off into the distance. He notices Curtis looking at him, waiting for an answer.Thanks.What do you mean?I'm not.Hello. She half stands and offers a hand.Curtis. Curtis shakes and they sit. Kendra opens a manila folder.Okay. I already answered all the questions on the forms.Right. Well... Curtis slides the yellow legal pad out of the book he brought. It's the library book on Mental Illness.Out of the five possible symptoms needed to be diagnosed withdelusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, and the negative symptoms, I've had two. Delusions and hallucinations. But they say it has to continue for six months to be diagnosed schizophrenia and mine hasn't been goin' on anywhere near that long. So, I took this quiz in the back of the book and I scored a five out of a possible twenty. Schizophrenia starts at twelve. So, they say it might be a... brief psychotic disorder. Whatever it is, I need to know what to do or what to get on to get this thing under control. Kendra stares at him.Yeah, I don't know my mother's symptoms. I was just 10. My brother was 17. And, uh...I don't know. She just left me in the car in the parking lot at the grocery store one day. And she didn't come back. And then they found her a week later eatin' trash out of a dumpster in northern Kentucky.My dad had to put her in the state hospital in Columbus. And she's been in assisted living ever since. Yep. My dad raised me. He died last April. Kendra nods, a pleasant look on her face.Hey. It's all right. Calm down. Samantha takes Hannah into the house without saying a word.Samantha.I didn't want you worryin' about it.I got a home improvement loan from the bank. Samantha is stunned. She stands and gets in his face.I'm doin' it...I'm doin' it for us. I know you don't understand.There's nothin' to explain. Samantha stares at his face, searching for an answer. She's on the verge of tears.I'm gonna go put Hannah to bed. Curtis walks out of the room. Samantha can't hold back, tears run down her face.No. It's fine. It's fine. Don't send an ambulance. It's fine. Curtis clicks off the phone.I'm sorry you fellows had to come all the way out.Yeah. That's all right.. I'll see somebody on Monday.Thanks. Curtis shakes their hands. He turns to walk back in the house and notices NEIGHBORS watching from their porches.I haven't been honest with you. I'm sorry.I've been havin' these dreams. I guess they're more like nightmares. It's why I've been actin' like this. Samantha listens with a furrowed brow.They always start with a kind of storm. Like a real powerful storm.And there's always this dark, thick rain. Like fresh motor oil. And then the things, people, it just makes `em crazy. They attack me. Sometimes they go after Hannah. First one I had Red nearly chewed through my arm.Yeah.It was Dewart. We were at the job site. The storm started and somethin' happened. His face. His eyes were different. He came after me with a pick ax. And we fought. And he ran it through my leg. Curtis zones out for a moment. Samantha says nothing.It's hard to explain, because it's not just a dream. It's a feeling. I'm afraid something might be comin'. Something that's...not right. I can not describe it. I just need you to believe me. Samantha's eyes are red. Her nose. She nods slightly and dabs the tissue at the corner of her eye.I've been to a counselor. I've seen her a few times. This makes Samantha look up.You know what I come from. And I promised myself...I promised myself I would never leave. And I am doin' everything that I can to make that true. The room is quiet. Samantha watches her husband.Six weeks?Yeah.Yeah. That sounds good. We'll get it done. Russell rolls up the charts. They walk toward the work site, toward Dewart.I need a favor Jim.Can you take Dewart off my crew? Just reassign him someplace else. Jim sets his pen down and leans back.No, nothin' like that. He's a good worker. He's a good man. He's my friend. I think it'd be easier not being in charge of someone I'm so close to. Jim nods.Yes sir. I appreciate that but... well it would just be very helpful in this case.No. Whoever you think's right.Thank you. Curtis turns to leave the office.I know. My daughter's had a lot of doctor's visits. I haven't let anything get behind.Yessir. Curtis shows himself out.Yeah. Can I look at one of these gas masks?The newest one. The OWNER of the store removes a mask and hands it to him. Curtis fiddles with the mask.How much?Anything cheaper?You got any kids sizes?Yeah. Ring me up a couple of `em.Just addin' on to the storm shelter.Just `cause. Kyle notices the PVC piping running in the trenches.Oh, yeah. From our well. Runnin' sewer out to the city line.It's not bad.Yeah.I'm not. Kyle is staring him down. Curtis just looks at the shelter. There's a long silence shared between them.I figured. Curtis climbs back onto the shipping container and continues installing the roof vent.Called you to come tell me to quit?So what?No. No more than anybody else.Uh, huh...Hey, look. You wanna come by and have dinner sometime, Kyle. That's fine. We'll have a beer and talk about the old days, but you got somethin' to say just say it.Well I appreciate it Kyle.Yeah. A few days ago.You should see her. Take your girls.No. I've got it. Kyle nods.I will. Kyle looks at him for a moment. He turns and walks toward the driveway.Hey Kyle? Kyle turns back. Curtis climbs onto the yard and walks over to him.Actually you could do me a favor.You still looking for a dog?They got a good spot for you, okay bud. Kyle stands at the passenger door to the truck.Yeah.Hey Kyle?Take care of yourself.All right. Bedtime. Hannah looks up at him. Curtis signs his hand like a pillow then touches his watch. They move out of the bathroom.Ah shit.Hey Jim.Yeah. It was just a hauler and a backhoe. It was Saturday. I had `em back in less than 8 hours.Well, I'm sorry Jim. I hadn't thought of that. Thank God nothin' like that happened. You know? I'll do whatever I can to make it right.Did you fire Dewart?I've been fired. Samantha continues clearing the dishes to the sink. She doesn't look up.We get two more weeks. Samantha slams the plates into the sink. They break. She holds her head back and stares at the ceiling. She walks over to Curtis...I'm sorry... ...and SLAPS him across the face. Hannah begins to cry.Oh, `scuse me. Andy rises from his chair.Yeah.What happened to Kendra?Huh.That's the alternator from the truck.I was just trying to figure out a way to charge enough batteries to run lights down there. Ah, what the hell? Maybe I'll hook it up to your old exercycle. Samantha almost smiles. Curtis keeps his eyes on the parts.You gonna leave me? Samantha looks at his hands. They hang by his sides.I'm sorry.Yeah.Yeah.Doctor Shannan gave me the number of somebody. But, uh, I just don't think we can afford it.I don't want to see any of those people.All right. Curtis nods. Samantha let's go of his hand and walks back to the house. Curtis goes back to studying the auto parts.How many pieces does Hannah get?Not here man. Dewart taps him on the shoulder again.I know.I know. I'm sorry. Dewart shoves him in the chest.Come on. Dewart punches Curtis in the face. It stings.God dammit.You think I'm crazy?! Huh! Is that what he told you! Curtis TURNS OVER A TABLE. He points to the gawking crowd.Well, listen up! There is a storm comin' like nothing you have ever seen. And not a one of you is prepared for it.Sleep well in your beds. Cause if this thing comes true, there ain't gonna be any more. Curtis looks down at Dewart. He turns to see Hannah. She's tucked under her Mother's leg crying. This hits him hard. He stops. Looking at Samantha, his eyes fill with tears.Hannah? He pulls his head out from the hood and sees Hannah standing on the curb. She looks down the street. He runs down his driveway, wiping his hands on a rag and watching the horizon.Hannah! A FLOCK OF BIRDS, flying in intricate geometric patterns, swarm above the house at the end of the street. They twist and bend into speckled black shapes. Hannah, watching, walks into the street. Curtis catches her by the hand. He turns away from the birds to see a STORM CELL building on the opposite horizon. He scoops Hannah into his arms, stepping back from it. The SOUND of the birds grows louder. Curtis pivots to find the mass of birds barreling down the street toward him. He turns away as the wall of birds crash past him. The force so powerful it knocks him backward. He covers Hannah's head, dodging the onslaught of wind and wings. The Flock passes. Curtis stands, his face cut and scraped. Hannah cries, clinging to his chest.Come on. It's okay. Curtis leads them through the entry to the larger section of the shelter. Samantha takes Hannah and sits with her on one of the cots. She's signing to her, trying to calm her down.It's okay. All right. Come on. Sit down. Curtis goes to a trunk in the corner and begins rooting through it. He removes two gas masks and an oxygen mask connected to a small tank. He goes over and kneels in front of Hannah. He tries slipping the oxygen mask over her face. Samantha grabs his wrist.It's okay. It's oxygen. Here. Put this on. Curtis hands Samantha a gas mask.Please just do it. Okay? He looks to Hannah and places an oxygen mask over her face..There we go. All right. Keep it out of your eyes. Okay? He signs to her.Hey. I love you. It's okay. Curtis eases on the knob at the top of the tank. He climbs onto the cot and puts his arm around them. He slips on his gas mask. Samantha is hesitant. She looks at her husband in the mask and leans back against the side of the container. Hannah looks up at her. She touches her mother's mask. Samantha slips on the gas mask.Where's your mask?No. Curtis hesitates.What if it's not over?It's still storming.I can hear it. Samantha stares at him. The room is silent.Put your hand on the door. You can feel it. He takes Samantha's wrist and guides her to the doors. He watches her face as she places a hand against the metal. She looks at him, her eyes getting red, and shakes her head \"no\". Curtis kneels in front of Hannah and mimics the signs from earlier.Thunder? Do you feel it?You feel it? You feel it? Hannah walks to her mother. Samantha holds onto her. Curtis steps back from them. They watch him, their backs to the doors. He flinches and covers his mouth.I'm sorry.I'm sorry. Samantha walks over to him.I'm sorry. I can't. Samantha looks at the keys, then at Curtis. Tears shake from his trembling face.Could you move Hannah back?It's fine. She walks over to Curtis and hugs him. He kisses Samantha on the head. Curtis looks up at the sky.I don't have a job right now.You mean I have to leave my family.Hey. Good, huh? Hannah sits on her knees in front of Curtis sprinkling dry sand over castle shaped mounds already formed.Good. We put a top on it. Curtis smooths out the sand in the castle shaped bucket and turns it over to top off their sand mound. He hands the bucket over for Hannah to refill. The SOUND of the waves behind them has STOPPED. They don't notice. Curtis takes two fingers and digs a small trench around the sand castle.What is it honey? Curtis misses it. He shakes his head, \"no\", and Hannah signs again, slowly: \"S-T-O-R-M\".What? Curtis turns to the shoreline, getting to his feet. He looks down at Hannah, who watches, mesmerized. Scared, she looks to her father. He grabs her under the arms and rests her on his hip. She buries her head into his chest.Sam. Samantha looks down at her palm. She rubs the thick, viscous rain in her fingers. She looks back up at the storm.

Cammie said she just needed to get out of the house. Samantha takes her seat at the table.Cam can hold her own. We need to send in the deposit for the beach condo. He kneels beside his daughter's chair and waits for her to make eye contact. She looks over at him. He speaks using sign language. Three broad, slow gestures.Okay. Bye. Samantha sips her coffee as Hannah feeds more toast to the dog.No more food. You, eat.Oh my god. Cammie laughs.You guys okay?No. Don't touch. Hannah tilts her head, looking off to the side. Samantha touches her chin bringing her eyes back around.You understand? Hannah nods once, \"yes\".Oksy. Come here. Samantha stands and takes the board to a trash pile in the back corner of the yard. A STORM SHELTER is buried in the ground just behind the pile. It's a grass covered mound with two rusted metal doors angled toward the sky. She throws the board onto the heap and wipes her hands on her pants. Staring at the pile, she lets out an irritated sigh. Thunder rumbles low in the distance. She looks up at the approaching clouds and calls to the children as she walks back inside.Hey, DJ. Bring the girls inside.Bye guys. Thanks for coming over.Okay. Love you.Bye Cam. Running for her car holding a jacket covered car seat. Samantha closes the door and listens to her quiet house. The rain outside is the only noise. She heads to the kitchen.Can you sign s-t-o-r-m?Storm. Hannah looks back out the window. They watch the storm together.She was fine. She's still not playin' with the others, though. She can't connect. Honey, you gotta clean up that trash pile in the back. She fished out a board that had nails on it.I still whisper. He pulls her tight. They stand together in the doorway. The house is silent.Curtis?Did you hear me? You got to be home, showered, ready to walk out the door by six tonight. Curtis stands up and goes over to Hannah. He grabs her off the floor and she begins to protest with kicks and crying.What's wrong?She's fine down there. She had toast already. Curtis, against flailing, manages to get Hannah in her chair. Curtis backs off, frustrated. Hannah climbs down from her chair and goes back to the floor and the dog.Curtis?You didn't eat anything? Heading out.Come on we gotta go.You're not sorry.Well, you stink. You smell really bad. He smiles.Stop.Here honey. Put on your shoesGood, you're up. Curtis doesn't turn to greet her. He just stirs a spoon in the black coffee. Samantha walks up to him and puts a hand on his back. She notices that his shirt is soaked with sweat.Honey, you're soaked. He turns, taking a sip from the mug. She feels his forehead.Are you sick?I guess we could stay home if we need to.It's Saturday, I was going to take Hannah to my booth.You look really sick honey.Let me get you some Advil. She heads for the hallway.You sure?Okay. I got my phone if you need anything. Don't forget Sunday lunch is here tomorrow. This reminder makes Curtis rub his face with a grunt.If you're sick, we should cancel.Okay, we'll talk later. She heads for the door with Hannah.Come on. Let's go.Okay. Samantha scoops up her bag and takes Hannah by the hand. They leave the room. Curtis notices the dog, Red, sitting on his haunches looking at him. Curtis stares back, sipping his coffee.This pillow's fifteen dollars.This is all hand stitched. It takes a really long time. That's why I charge that.I can't go that low.How about 10? The woman doesn't look up.That's fine. The woman smiles and removes a Ziplock bag of assorted coins from her purse. Hannah takes the bag.Lucky for you she likes to count change. Hannah opens the bag and begins to turn it over.But that's what I don't understand. If he didn't do anything why did you put him out back? Samantha counts out the money earned at the flea market. She sets a portion aside and closes the tackle box. Curtis says something, but it's inaudible.What? She opens the tin and removes an envelope with the word \"BEACH\" written on it in black sharpie. Samantha adds the money to the envelope and puts up the jar. She opens the fridge and takes out the milk.You hear me? I said if he didn't do anything why did you have to put him outside? Curtis' attention is on the TV. Samantha sits on the couch.He's your dog. He's always been an inside dog.Hannah loves Red.It's awful.Yeah?You're still not feeling good?Uh, yeah baby but he'll be closed today. She approaches the bed and he holds his hand out.Honey if you're not feeling good we take you in somewhere. She walks closer to the bed.Okay. Do you want me to cancel lunch today...What is that?I was gonna leave Hannah with you so I could go to church, but I'm not going to with you like this.No. She needs breakfast.I'm sorry that you feel bad but you need to drop the attitude.What's wrong with you?Hannah's in the den. We have cereal for her. Samantha stomps out of the room. Curtis sighs. He halfway lifts the sheet then lets it fall again.Let's just start.Where the hell have you been?You're really late.You didn't even bring your cell phone. Samantha heads back to the dining room. Curtis sucks his teeth.Dad.Can I give you a hug?I love you.I have good news.Green? How `bout a red? She pretends to use the crayon as lipstick.It was like talking to a sane person for once. She made one phone call. That's it. I've been trying that 800 number for weeks.Like this. Samantha shows him the sign. Curtis mimics.Oh, honey. Look at this one. It's a 2-1 and it sits directly on the beach. Wouldn't that be great? We wouldn't have to worry about Hannah crossing traffic. Curtis walks over and leans in to see the page. They are rental photos of beach condos.Eight ninety nine a week.You sleep well?You look like you're feeling better. Curtis nods and eats his breakfast.Hey.It's okay. Where you been?Is she okay?You shoulda told me we would have gone with you.Come to bed.I don't know what our schedule will be, but...Absolutely.Good night. As Samantha talks to the Teacher, Curtis looks over flashcards with Hannah. He signs \"SUNSHINE\", a circle in the sky with the hand then coming down, fingers spread.Are you out of your mind? She continues into the house. Curtis turns, frustrated. Dewart takes this in, then goes back to his nails.Not a word. You didn't say one word about this to me. Don't you think you owe me that? Don't you think that you might respect me enough to at least consider what I had to say?Well I'm worried Curtis. How are you paying for all that?How could you do that without talking to me? You know the expenses we have comin' up. You want to waste money on a stupid tornado shelter?You're right. I don't understand. I don't understand half the stuff you've been doin' lately. I don't understand you puttin' Red out back. I don't understand you stayin' up all night in that stupid tornado shelter. You don't come to bed half the time. You leave and don't tell me where you're goin'. Explain that to me. Please. Tell me something that helps me understand why you're bein' like this.Curtis! She touches his arms. A small amount of BLOOD begins to trickle from both sides of his mouth.Baby. Oh, my God. Baby...Oh, my God. Baby. Samantha jumps off the bed and grabs a cordless phone on the dresser. She dials, watching her husband continue to shake.I need an ambulance! My husband's having a seizure. 41800 Tindale Road. Hurry up. He's bleeding! Samantha goes over to him. Holding her hands out, cautious to touch him.Okay. Okay. Samantha puts the phone receiver down on the nightstand. The Operator's VOICE still coming through. She touches his arm. Suddenly, the seizures stop. Curtis' body is still. Samantha freezes. His eyes open and he thrashes up in bed. Samantha jumps, tripping and stumbling backward. Curtis sucks short breaths into his lungs. His head darts back and forth, eyes wild. He sees Samantha staring up at him from the floor. He begins to calm down. Curtis touches his mouth. Sees the blood there.Honey? Samantha stands up and goes over to him. She sits on the edge of the bed and touches his arm. She's scared.Honey? Are you okay? Curtis slowly nods.You were having a seizure. I called an ambulance. Curtis sees the phone on the nightstand and grabs it.What are you doing? Curtis wraps his arms around her. He holds her tight. The SOUND of ambulance sirens approach from the distance. Samantha speaks, her voice trembling.Baby what's goin' on?What's goin' on?That's why you put him out back?What was the dream? Tonight.It's wonderful.I know they just usually do oysters and fries but what if we did something healthier on the side?I don't know. Maybe a vegetable or salad.Things are fine. We're fine. Nat smiles sympathetically.You okay? She touches his hand. Curtis FLINCHES. Their eyes meet. He wants to take it back, and she can see that. It begins to sink in for her. Hannah vocalizes something behind them. Samantha looks at her husband, shakes her head in disbelief. Hannah makes another sound, pounds on the back door. Samantha turns and sees a MAN standing in their backyard. She flinches.Who's that? Curtis stands to see out the back door.What about the health insurance?I'm so sorry. I completely forgot.Here. I hope you like them. Samantha hands over the plastic bag.That's terrific. It's fine.Call me if they don't work and I'm sorry again.What's that?You flinched when I touched your hand this morning.I was in one of your dreams? Curtis nods.Can you deal with that? He holds open his hand to her. She takes it.Okay. Then I made a decision. We cancel the beach trip. We have enough to cover bills for the next two months with your last check. I'm going to get a job. You're gonna find another job. I'm going to call to see if we can move Hannah's surgery up. We'll need to see what it costs to extend your policy to the end of the year. I want you to see a psychiatrist. Not a counselor from the free clinic. Someone good.We'll find the money. Also, the Lions Club supper's this weekend. I want you to come with me.I want you to go. I need to do something normal.Just one. Curtis uses tongs to grab pieces of fried oyster. Looking up, he can see back through the kitchen to an open door outside. Dewart stands there over a butane fired frying pot. He wears an apron and stares at Curtis. Curtis moves down the line.Curtis.Curtis! Wake up! Wake up! TORNADO SIRENS continue to scream throughout the neighborhood. Curtis looks to the window. Rain and hail are battering the house. He jumps to his feet and grabs Samantha by the arm. They rush out of the room.No. Don't do that.Are you kidding?Wake up babe. Curtis' head moves. He sees that Samantha and Hannah have removed their masks.We took them off. It's fine. Take it off.We're fine. Take it off. Curtis slips the mask off his face. Worried, he takes a breath.You need to open the door now.What?It's over. Get the keys. Open the door. Curtis slowly gets to his feet. He sees the dark entryway to the original section of the shelter. Taking the lantern, he walks to it. Samantha and Hannah follow. Curtis stops just inside. He holds the lantern up, illuminating the padlocked metal doors. He looks back at his family, then climbs the steps. He places his hand on the door. He flinches.No. It's not.I don't hear anything.Baby, there's no storm outside.Curtis. I wouldn't lie to you. We love you very much. Please open the door. Curtis is on the verge of tears. He slowly reaches into his jeans pocket. He removes the keys. He holds them out to Samantha.I love you, but if I open the door, then nothin's gonna change. You'll see that everything's fine, but nothing will change. Please. This is what it means to stay with us. This is something you have to do. He looks at Hannah, then Samantha. Curtis steadies himself, trying to control his flinching. He wipes his face with the back of his hands and takes a deep breath. Curtis walks toward the doors. On the steps, he reaches up to the padlock. The keys shake in his fingers. He turns to Samantha.We usually go on a trip to Myrtle Beach every summer. We were gonns go this month.What does that mean?Okay.", "clean_line": "slept late ve got finish curtains saturday nat cam coming yeah cammie said needed house samantha takes seat table cam hold need

We're gonna have to call it! Curtis looks back to a potential STORM. Gray clouds forming across the horizon.What? It's not my fault! I told you!Nat and me been lookin' into a threesome. We've been chattin' with a girl online from Canton. Yeah. Big `ol girl.She's about two fifty, two seventy five. She can't be no taller than 5 foot. Dewart starts laughing, which makes Curtis laugh.No. I don't guess you would. Dewart is staring at Curtis.You got a good life Curtis.I'm serious. I think that's the best compliment you can give a man, take a look at his life and say, that's good. That guy's doin' somethin' right.Hell I know that. Dewart sees something out his window.Ah shit. I gotta go...Manana.Think we got time?We stripped that bit.Curtis! Curtis acknowledges Dewart but can't take his eyes off the pattern of birds. They shrink and stretch from thick clumps to long cylindrical tubes. A choreography. Curtis reluctantly heads back to the rig, which is shrieking with the SOUND of metal on metal.(holding his hand to hisThey want us to get a pilot hole drilled by lunch. I figure worse comes to worse we can eat on the rig.Yeah. Same old shit.What do you mean?Not a lot.I don't know.
