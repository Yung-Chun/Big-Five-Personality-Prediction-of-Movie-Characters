{"Good-Girl-The": {"JUSTINE": {"raw_line": "I was wonderin', when was that, uh, bible study?Can I bring my husband?The Holy Bible. There's one for you, and one for me.We're goin' to Bible study. A couple that prays together, stays together.Well you heard wrong.Cheryl? You think you can take this one?Phil, what the hell are you doin'? We're gonna be late for Bible study. You're stoned, you got paint in your hair, would you just get in the shower?Get in the shower.Yeah, I guess.What do you mean?Saw me what?He left.Just let the other people do the talking.Well, that's alright, they'll forgive us.Hi Corny. This is my husband, Phil.Phil, come with me to the car.Come with me to the car, I gotta get somethin'.Just get in the car. Get in the car, Phil.I don't want to go to Bible study.Because I don't want to. Now, can we please just get out of here?I don't care. I'm not in the mood.Why? Beacause we forgot our Bibles is why.Yeah, well, they may not, alright. So can we please just get the shit outta here?I don't care, fine by me.Oh geez, we forgot our Bibles.Oh. Well, we felt bad.I can't go.I can't go today. There's something important I need to tend to.Well, something came up.Um, okay. I think, maybe, somebody's found out about us.Well, maybe I don't get you.That's easy for you to say, Holden, you are not married.Holden, you are gonna get us caught!I won't.I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Okay?Thanks.Why?Bubba sat like that for what seemed like ten years before he began to speak. Finally, when he opened his mouth, he talked a blue streak about the ruin that was his life. He talked about how he loved Phil, and how he loved me. And how he always wanted a girlfriend just like me, and to be a guy like Phil, to this imaginary girl like me, that he never found. Then he wen on about givin' up your dreams and how it's all a part of gettin' older. Bubba had given up on his dream to be like Phil, and accepted his fate as Bubba, always and forever. Then, last week, a door that remained shut swung wide open. Bubba thought this no chance coincidence, a cosmic force was at work. The sounds of me makin' love to a man that wasn't Phil was like a shout in Bubba's ear from the creator himself. What it meant, or what to do, or why Bubba didn't know. All he knew was that he hated me for poisoning the well of idealism that he had drunk from for so long. I was no longer Bubba's image of perfection. To him I was just a liar, and a whore, and that sickened him. But on the other hand he loved me for opening his eyes and releasing him from the bitter chains of evny that bound him to Phil. Phil was no superman, just a cuckhold, and a foll, and that was beautiful. Bubba felt that there was just one thing left for us to do. Something that would solve both our problems and end this whole tragic cycle.Bubba, I am not gonna sleep with you.But, one person's liberation is another person's, well, badness. There's just no way.Why?You wanna cuckhold him yourself!Oh god! There was someone in the window! Did you not see?I gotta go.Get this damn dog away from me!Great. Good for you.You're nervous? Why?You can do it.Okay.Oh. Is it? Thanks.We're not friends.No, we don't.Oh my god. What are you doin'?I saw you. You followed me.No, Holden, this is all because of you. He had me over a barrel. If I didn't sleep with him he was gonna tell Phil about us!You've gotta get a hold of yourself! Are you drunk?It's not what you think.Look, go home. Sober up. And meet me after work.I gotta help Phil with his sperm.Just go. Go!Great.Good luck, honey.No, I don't.Nothin' happened yesterday, so drop it.Bubba, I mean it.It's Justine.You've never done it on your own?Ah, they're sore.My stomach's crampin'. I feel sore.Nah, it's stress.You're breakin' out 'cause you put so much makeup on your face.What?... No...Oh my god, Blackberries.Calm down, Holden!Hey, hey! I am not a hooker.Why?I do. I mean I'm depressed but... You are really depressed.Oh... I, I promise.I realized then that Holden was at best a child, and at worst a demon. If I was ever gonna go straight I'd have to ditch him. Sometimes, to get back on the road to redemption, you have to make a few pit stops.How much are the blackberries?Thank you.Have a blackberry.Have a blackberry, Holden!They looked dirty. I, I think I saw a bug in them or something.I'm worried about Holden. Tom. I'm worried about Tom. I just befriended Tom, recently, and now, well, I think he's mentally ill. He has this idea in his head that we've had some sort of affair. Which is crazy because I'm, I'm married. He's been sayin' all sorts of strange things, and makin' threats. And drinkin'. And, and I just think he would be better off in a place where people, professionals, could take care of him. Otherwise, he's just gonna get himself in trouble.It's a home pregnancy test.'Cause I still haven't gotten my period.Well, I haven't taken it yet. Could you give me a minute please?Okay.Blue?It means I'm pregnant.Maybe.The test could be wrong, Phil. It's a little early to be havin' a party.No, I'm excited. It's just, a lot of worries come with havin' a baby...Do you think anything's gonna change havin' a baby?Yeah, but I mean, do you think anything's really gonna change?Go find out.C'mon Cheryl, I'm gonna kill you.Oh my god.Who?Cheryl!Oh my god.What?! No!I don't know what you're talkin' about.No. I don't know anything.I hardly know him.I don't know anything.Holden, the police are lookin' for you!Hey! They think that I'm in on it, too! Corny's got a camera in that storage room. That Bible thumpin' pervert's been watchin' us the whole time.I'm gettin' all goosey. I think I'm gonna crash. I'm pregnant, Holden.Not necessarily.Even if it is, you cannot raise a baby on the run.I can't go tonight. I gotta pack my things and I'd have to get more money.This is all going too fast.Nothin'.Okay.Hey.Sorry.Hi.Thanks.They just got it wrong, so...How it all came down to this, only the devil knows. Retail Rodeo was at the corner on my left, the motel was down the road to my right. I closed my eyes and tried to peer into the future. On my left I saw days upon days of lipstick and ticking clocks. Dirty looks and quiet whisperings. and burning secrets that won't ever die away. And on my right, what could I picture? The blue sky, the desert earth streching out into the eerie infinity. A beautiful, never ending nothing.I know where you can find him.He's at the Hotel Glen Capri, and he'll be there till noon.Hey.Oh yeah. I was doin' laundry.They gave me the day off.No.What?Hey Phil.What?Yes.I don't know why.You're the only man alive that I love.It's your baby.It is. I swear. I swear to God.It doesn't matter.Yes.Yeah, yeah.Don't.I'm sorry, Phil.Okay. Get stoned.What are those?Just do it normal for once?No.That's terrible.That day I read the story Holden wrote for me. It was kinda different from the other one, but kinda the same. It was about a woman who was put upon. Whose job was a prison, and whose life had lost all meaning. Other people don't get her, especially her husband. One day she meets a boy who is also put upon, and they fall in love. After spending their whole lives not getting got, with one look they get eachother completely. In the end, the boy and the girl run away together in the wilderness, never", "clean_line": "wonderin uh bible study bring husband holy bible goin bible study couple prays stays heard wrong cheryl think phil hell doin gonna late bible study stoned got paint hair shower shower yeah guess mean saw left let people talking alright ll forgive hi corny husband phil phil come car come car gotta somethin car car phil want bible study want care mood beacause forgot bibles yeah alright shit outta care fine oh geez forgot bibles oh felt bad today important need tend came um okay think maybe somebody maybe easy holden married holden gonna caught won ll tomorrow okay okay thanks bubba sat like like years began speak finally opened mouth talked blue streak ruin life talked loved phil loved wanted girlfriend like guy like phil imaginary girl like wen givin dreams gettin older bubba given dream like phil accepted fate bubba forever week door remained shut swung wide open bubba thought chance coincidence cosmic force work sounds makin love man wasn phil like shout bubba ear creator meant bubba know knew hated poisoning idealism drunk long longer bubba image perfection liar whore sickened hand loved opening eyes releasing bitter chains evny bound phil phil superman cuckhold foll beautiful bubba felt thing left solve problems end tragic cycle bubba gonna sleep person liberation person badness way wanna cuckhold oh god window gotta damn dog away great good nervous okay oh thanks friends oh god doin saw followed holden barrel sleep gonna tell phil ve gotta hold drunk think look home sober meet work gotta help phil sperm great good luck honey nothin happened yesterday drop bubba mean justine ve ah sore stomach crampin feel sore nah stress breakin cause makeup face oh god blackberries calm holden hey hey hooker mean depressed depressed oh promise realized holden best child worst demon gonna straight ditch road redemption pit stops blackberries thank blackberry blackberry holden looked dirty think saw bug worried holden tom worried tom befriended tom recently think mentally ill idea head ve sort affair crazy married sayin sorts strange things makin threats drinkin think better place people professionals care gonna trouble home pregnancy test cause haven gotten period haven taken minute okay blue means pregnant maybe test wrong phil little early havin party excited lot worries come havin baby think gonna change havin baby yeah mean think gonna change mon cheryl gonna kill oh god cheryl oh god know talkin know hardly know know holden police lookin hey think corny got camera storage room bible thumpin pervert watchin time gettin goosey think gonna crash pregnant holden necessarily raise baby run tonight gotta pack things money going fast nothin okay hey sorry hi thanks got wrong came devil knows retail rodeo corner left motel road right closed eyes tried peer future left saw days days lipstick ticking clocks dirty looks quiet whisperings burning secrets won die away right picture blue sky desert earth streching eerie infinity beautiful ending know hotel glen capri ll till noon hey oh yeah doin laundry gave day hey phil yes know man alive love baby swear swear god matter yes yeah yeah sorry phil okay stoned normal terrible day read story holden wrote kinda different kinda woman job prison life lost meaning people especially husband day meets boy fall love spending lives getting got look eachother completely end boy girl run away wilderness"}}}
