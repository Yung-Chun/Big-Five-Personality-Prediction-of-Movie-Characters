Here...Know this place?How do I get there? Tell me.Yes. Very strange.I - ah - couldn't think of anything else to do. I thought maybe you know something... I'm scared.I woke up in a subway.

Each one teaches you more about your invention. I'm what is called a murderer.You've given everybody memories, but I missed out. The Doctor saw to that - played your own game.

Look at this!Fine? Look here!How can I submit this?Do you wash your hands before you type things?Well be more careful, please.A formality. I need to speak with Thompson.

Nobody move.Shut up! Everybody stay calm...What's that?Dammit! I'm curious? How many so far?The six year old. Sure, you remember.You sure have demonstrated a great deal of... imagination. The baby was the best though. Several cops lost their lunch over that one. Head twisted off, spine pulled out, yeech...We count seven so far. Anyone we missed?What is it, Crenshaw?Dammit. Very efficient, as usual, Crenshaw. Remind me to give you my watch. It needs fixing.Shut-up.Gesundheit!Get out.Wait here.Bumstead.

And how is his state of mind?You seem a little edgy. Everything okay?To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this. Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.This is highly irregular. I have a right to know.I see...He's been a little angel...Yes, sir. I'm sorry... But I don't understand how it was possible. The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...Yes, sir.I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.You don't look so well... C'mon, let me in Thompson.What? Who has?What is going on?Jesus! We have to get you to a doctor...But... How long has this been happening?The other one?Jesus. Small world.

Who is this?I need everything on the Jonathan White case.All the important stuff. Wrap it up for me.Please - I'm in a hurry.Why give yourself up?That was a pretty good escape act at the station. How did you do that?Who?Why are they after you?Don't know much, do you?Please. Not that way. If you could just follow the covering - the carpet gets stained and it's impossible to clean.Everything the department knows about John White is in this. Here. Excuse me for a moment.That stuff helpful?You're case has been driving me crazy. You see, I pride myself on being thorough. There's too many loose ends with your case. Thought it was best you were hidden until we understand more about the facts. What do you know about these men in black?Here. Careful with your trousers. That stuff stains.Here.Any idea what part the Doctor plays in this business?Let's try and find out, shall we. Lace is untied.I didn't tell you the entire reason I helped you. It started with two little girls. Twins. Used to play with them when I was young. Couldn't remember for the life of me what they looked like, then I understood why...They didn't have faces.That's right. Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads. No mistake. I just hadn't remembered it that way. Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory. That's not all. Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies. It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event. Then I would turn the lights off. Sit down in a comfortable chair... And study each detail of this subject.Everything was liquid beneath a thin surface that had always seemed solid to me...Is there anything you haven't told me about this business? Even the most insignificant thing?Go on.Why, that's ridiculous. You just...We'll get to the bottom of this. I mean it.I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor. Tall fellow. No hair. Rather pale skin...That's surprising. He was leaving your office at the time...I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.Just like that?What is this place?It sure isn't the fun-fair.What?The Eye - um - delicious with horseradish on rye!Nothing to it...Was that for real down there?What the hell is that?Quick. My car.This ocean business... I know where I can find a map. I need to go back to the station. Where will you be?Good. Uh-oh...Take mine.Jump!At first I thought there was no way to get to the ocean... The buildings are a barrier, no windows, no doors - everything just, well, ends - only thing would be drill a hole. But then, I saw it, one door, just one... Inside a tenement building...I can't wait any longer...But she was getting better...She doesn't have cancer.White?Dammit.Gesundheit!", "clean_line": "know sir thirty um inconvenient yes sir understand yes ve fine far assistant thirty yes good evening sir germs sir places thompson sir wasn\u00edt case she\u00eds getting better thanks real shame dammit don\u00edt sneak like didn\u00edt requisition secretary good fine don\u00edt drink coffee cup tea good milk sugar investigations madman fabricated entire bizarre paranoid delusion internal logic mess horrible mess it\u00eds second time look typed report wrong look fine look submit wash hands type things careful formality need speak thompson officially need written permission hunch able it\u00eds extremely important investigation actually wondering sir let uniforms follow lost long spinning backwards want prints hold police shut everybody stay calm dammit curious far year old sure remember sure demonstrated great deal imagination baby best cops lost lunch head twisted spine pulled yeech count seven far missed crenshaw dammit efficient usual crenshaw remind watch needs fixing shut gesundheit wait bumstead mother know doctor need file daniel paul schreber doctor brings state mind little edgy okay tell truth glad ve run like maybe help tidy loose ends highly irregular right know little angel yes sir sorry understand possible window feet vertical wall cuffed yes sir serial killer case need talk look mon let thompson going jesus doctor long happening jesus small world photographer interrogate alright won hurt bumstead need jonathan white case important stuff wrap hurry pretty good escape act station know way follow covering carpet gets stained impossible clean department knows john white excuse moment stuff helpful case driving crazy pride thorough loose ends case thought best hidden understand facts know men black careful trousers stuff stains idea doctor plays business let try shall lace untied tell entire reason helped started little girls twins play young couldn remember life looked like understood faces right seamless flesh heads mistake hadn remembered way normal little girls memory started examining sorts things life inconsistencies like game think person place event turn lights sit comfortable chair study subject liquid beneath surface solid haven told business insignificant thing ridiculous ll mean met friend night doctor tall fellow hair pale skin surprising leaving office time think time introduced little friends like place sure isn fun fair eye um delicious horseradish rye real hell quick car ocean business know map need station good uh oh jump thought way ocean buildings barrier windows doors ends thing drill hole saw door inside tenement building wait longer getting better cancer white dammit gesundheit"}, "SCHREBER": {"raw_line": "You remember nothing?

Without a past we are nothing. This is why you are so interesting.Anything but, my friend.It feels no pain.Maybe.We know of two kinds of memory. Firstly, declarative memory.And then there is procedural memory.Follow?Research on simple animals can be... useful. To show us where memory storing systems are located, for example.

Beautiful! Head and all! Just how I like 'em!I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though. Trust me completely. I'm here to help.It can't wait?Ah, nearly done. So tell me about your dreams. I'm very interested.Ah, our friends in black... they are not just a figment of your imagination you know, in fact none of what you are experiencing is anything but real.I know everything about you. You have no choice but to trust me.Scarey, isn't it?Are you feeling alright?What are you doing?You can't go yet. We've got so much to talk about...You're tired. You need to lie down.Leave it!Damn!

You didn't kill anyone.Listen to what I have to say.

But this one's special. It will help you understand, everything...Anton - I mean, John, there has been an experiment, a dangerous experiment. I arranged it. It was a lie from the beginning. It almost worked, but things did not go as they should have. You have been left - blank.You can change this, all this. But you must take it.Please! Don't be foolish! Time is short.
