What does Beckett want with that?I have faith in you. Both of you.

Will has gone to find Jack!He's a better man than you give him credit for.A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.Then what is?I expect then that we can come to some sort of understanding. I'm here to negotiate.These Letters of Marque, they are signed by the King?Or else I would not still be here. You sent Will to get you the Compass owned by Jack Sparrow. It will do you no good.I have been to Isla de Muerta, I have seen the treasure myself.

I trust him, that's all.I just thought I'd be married by now. I'm so ready to be married.No, thank you.Oh. Except for a sense of honor, and decency and-and a moral center. And personal hygiene.You seem very certain.Why doesn't your Compass work?Because you and I *are* alike, and there will come a moment when you have a chance to show it. To do the right thing.You'll have the chance to do something... something courageous. And when you do, you'll discover something: that you're a good man.I have faith in you. Want to know why?Curiosity. You're going to want it. A chance to be admired. And gain the rewards that follow. You won't be able to resist. You're going to want to know... what it tastes like.But - seeing as you're a good man I know you will *never* put me in a position that would compromise my honor.I'm proud of you, Jack.This doesn't work. And it *certainly* doesn't show you what you want most.Beg your pardon?It's real!Will! You're alright! Thank God!

If you *do* happen to get captured, just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt!

So we've established my proposal is sound in principle, now we're just haggling over price.Just how many souls do you think my soul is worth?You're a diamond, mate. Send me back the boy, I'll get started right off.Have you not met Will Turner? He's noble, heroic, *terrific* soprano. Worth at least four... maybe three and a half. And did I happen to mention... he's in love. With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed. Dividing him from her and her from him... would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them be joined in holy matrimony. Aye?Yep! I'm good with it. Should we seal it in blood? I mean... mm-mm - ink?Uh!Oh, Mr. Gibbs.Uh, I feel sullied and unusual.Fortunately, he was mum as the condition in which these souls need be.Tortuga.I know what I want.How we going?You're hired.Time to go?Thanks, mate.Carry on.Come to join me crew, lad? Welcome aboard.I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea.Elizabeth. Hide the rum.You know, these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin.Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this but... through an unfortunate and *entirely* unforeseeable series of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor William has been press-ganged into Davy Jones' crew.You look bloody awful. What are you doing here?You *smell* funny.Are you certain? Is that what you really want most?Because I would think, you'd want to find a way to *save* Will the most.Well, there is a chest...A chest of unknown size and origin.And whoever possesses that chest possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants, including... saving brave William from his grim fate.With this. My Compass... is unique.True enough. This Compass does not point north.It points to the thing you want most in this world.Every word, love. And what you want most in this world is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not?By finding the chest of Davy Jones.Mister Gibbs!We have our heading.Miss Swann.Agh.Agh.Of course. He wants the chest.A truly discomforting notion, love.Might I inquire how as to how you came by these?Friendly?Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor. Yet you're the one standing here with the prize. Full pardon, commission as a privateer on behalf of England and the East India Trading Company. As if I could be bought for such a low price.No. Persuade me.As I said... Persuade me.My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.You know... Lizzy... I *am*... captain of a ship. And *being* captain of a ship, I could in fact perform a... marriage. Right here. Right on this deck. Right... *now*!Why not? We *are* very much alike, you and I. I and you. Us.Trifles. You *will* come over to my side, I know it.One word love: curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it's like. One day, you won't be able to resist.Uh my Compass works fine.I *love* those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by.All evidence to the contrary.Do tell, dearie.I *do* want to know what it tastes like.I want my jar of dirt.Guard the boat, mind the tide... Don't touch my dirt.Yes it *does*. You're sitting on it!Move.I do that quite a lot. Yet people are always surprised.How did you get here?Not so easy, is it?You do?What?Oh! Well... you're welcome, then.Pretty much. Time and tide, love.Oy! What're you doing?Can't let you do that, William. 'Cause if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now. If you please: The key.I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.Ah. The dark side of ambition.Let us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it, who at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to *free* said pirate, and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, hey? So who's fault is it, *really*, that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?Still rooting for you, mate!Wup!Oh.Woah!Oh, shut it.Jar of dirt!Leave him lie! Unless you plan on using him to hit something with.Uh, I say we respect his final wish.He fell behind.I'll handle this, mate.Hey! Fishface! Lose something? Hey?
