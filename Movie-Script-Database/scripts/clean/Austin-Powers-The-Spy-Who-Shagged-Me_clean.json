What are you doing, luv?Vanessa, you're a Fembot!Machine gun jubblies, how did I miss those?I can't believe Vanessa, my bride, my one true love, the woman who taught me the beauty of sharing your whole life with another, the person who taught me the meaning of love, was a Fembot. How will I ever go on? Wait a tic! That means I'm single! Oh, behave!Yeah, baby, I'm free! I'm naked and free!Shaguar, baby, yeah!Gor blimey, I'm on empty! That's funny, I just filled the Shaguar up this morning.You always are, Basil. Listen, the weirdest thing just happened, I've run out of petrol.Vanessa tried to kill me, Basil.

Miss Humpalot and I are going to have a 'private session'.November, 1964, Dutch East Indies, shore leave.I once had a bad experience with frostbite. I had to dip my tadger into a brandy snifter.I can guess, baby.I guessed wrong.They wear large hats?Wrong again.Of course. The... horsey... moves in an L shape.Let's stop playing games with each other... especially difficult ones. May I ask you a question, Miss Humpalot?Do I make you horny? Do I?Grrrr, baby.Grrrr. Ruf! Ruf! Wait a tick, I don't want him watching me while I'm on the job!Groovy, baby!Crikey, I've lost my mojo.There must be some kind of mistake, Basil. Maybe I was drunk and I didn't know it.I took a Viagra and it got caught in my throat. I've had a stiff neck for hours. Basil, is it true? Have I lost my mojo?Alright, miss, just let me finish this article on the Suez crisis.What's going on?But the test hasn't even started!Wait, I can explain, man! I was going to shag her but the article was so fascinating--Without my mojo, I'm useless to the Ministry and to Her Majesty. I think it's time to retire.Again?I can't read in the car. I get a bit vomy.Got it. I almost gipped.But Basil, isn't that the new Volkswagen Beetle?So, Basil, if I travel back to 1969 and I was frozen in 1967, I could go look at my frozen self. But, if I'm still frozen in 1967, how could I have been unthawed in the 90's and traveled back to the Sixties? Oh, no, I've gone cross-eyed.This is smashing Basil. I'll go back to the Sixties, recharge my mojo, defeat Dr. Evil and be back in time for tea.Luck has nothing to do with it, Basil.Sorry. Swinging Sixties, here I come, baby, yeah!I feel better already, man!Alright, baby, a swinging shin-dig!'THERE'S A SEXUAL REVOLUTION, YOU CAN FEEL IT IN THE AIR.

I guess I've changed. Not to make a short story long, or to ramble on and on, or to keep talking in a repetitive manner ad infinitum until it becomes impossible to remember what I was talking about in the first place, but- where was I?Oh yes. Felicity, I can't shag you. I've lost my mojo.I thought coming back to the Sixties would bring it back, but it hasn't.I'll warm up the Jumbo Jet, baby!How are you baby?Good on ya. I don't know what that means but it sounds fab.Guru, I'm having trouble performing.You know- my bits and pieces are a bit sleepy.I've forgotten the steps to the Mummy- Daddy dance.My flag's at half mast and no one will salute it.My Willie don't work.That's my problem.Alright, easy.

Yeah, baby, yeah!This shag-in is gonna blow your mind, baby, yeah!You'll thank me later, baby.Hey! Ricardo Monteblan, how are you?Crazy, man!Don't do anything I wouldn't do- at least not without me.Oh, behave!You're very exotic, baby. Do you have a little English in you?Would you like to?The Austin Powers Sexy Dictionary defines an Eskimo hooker as a frosty prosty.Those are skin tight. How do you get into those pants, baby?Hello, I am Baron Von Firstinbed. Last night I had German-Chinese food. An hour later I was hungry- for power.Did you hear about the contortionist who was engaged to be married?That's not a pretty sight. Who is he?How do you know?Who's the girl?Hello, hello.Who are you today, baby?Swallows? That's an interesting name. Are you English?Well which is it, baby, Spitz or Swallows? Either way, it's a pleasure.Charmed, I'm sure. How do you do? Yes, quite. I always enjoy meeting new people. How's your mum? Good. I love shaking hands.So, who was your friend?It suits him.OK. Would you happen to know if he's in business with a man named Mr. Evil?Really? I said Mister Evil. Austin does a smug take.Something to drink? Would you like a Mister Pepper?Really? I said Mister Pepper.Oh, behave!Can I ask you a question?Thank you.Oh, yes. Would you like to shag? Would you?You're a bit of alright.Sorry baby, too late. He's as dead as vaudeville.You know I can't tell you details about the future, baby, it could alter history.There've been a lot of advances in the Nineties, baby. The economy is stable, people take better care of their health concern for the environment is on the rise and, um, let's see, there's an entire television channel dedicated to golf.It's not so bad once you get used to it. The Nineties are about responsibility. You know, having respect for yourself and other people. I even got married.Well, it turns out there were some casualties, baby. Don't you think you'll ever get married?Oh, behave!Oh my God!No, written here on my hand, see?Says 'Oh my God!'Felicity, I haven't had this much fun since I worked undercover in Amsterdam-- '66 I think it was.Very impressive.Yes, I think I'm coming down with something.I'll get some ice cream. Would you like some?Could I have two scoops of Vanilla, please?Yes, please.I will, thank you.Yes please.No, laryngitis.Basil!I just had ice cream. Listen to me, I have dairy throat. \"Mary had a little lamb and it was always gruntin'. She tied it to a five bar gate and kicked it's little-But how can we track Fat Bastard?How did you get close enough to plant a homing device?You... him? Just like that?Did you use an elaborate set of pulleys? A block and tackle?I just can't get my head around it, baby. You're so small and he's so ... not small. The sheer mechanics of it are mindboggling!I got it! A Chinese basket with a counter-weighted ballast. That's how you did it, right?Who, me? That's not possible, baby! is it?Get down!According to the readings, Dr. Evil's headquarters is over the next ridge.Sure.Mmmmmmm...mmmmm...I seem to be stuck in your dirty pillows.I think they're in the tent.Have you got it out yet?Oh, anything that catches my fancy.Oh, it stretches to fit.Are you almost done? I can't hold it much longer.Yes. Listen, Felicity, about Fat Bastard-You're right, Felicity, I can't deny it. But the world changed, and I changed too.Ow! My back hurts.I'm fine, just keeping packing.We meet again, Dr. Evil.Dr. Evil your plan will never--My mojo!I don't care if he is evil, you don't give a man a shot in the pills. It's just not cricket, baby.Why don't you just shag Fat Bastard again?Ouch, baby, very ouch. I'm wounded.No, baby, you're right. I was wrong to judge you. I guess I am... jealous.That Austin is gone. I've changed. I knew someone, not long ago, a very special woman. She taught me that life isn't about jumping into the sack with whoever comes along, it's about caring and responsibility. And while it is true she turned out to be an evil robot minion of Dr. Evil, I suppose I really did... love her.Yes, Vanessa.With me?Groovy, baby!Alright, what if I pretend to be desperately ill with food poisoning? The guard, drawn by my cries of pain, will come to investigate. Meanwhile, you dig a pit and line it with makeshift punji sticks made from sharpened toothbrushes. The guard falls in, Bob's your uncle, and we've got the key. What do you think?I'm very firmly wedged.Almost... got it!Let's go get my mojo!I'm not sure.Watch out, baby, He-Bots!I can't fight them without my mojo.Smashing, Felicity, you were making me very horny, man! Extremely randy, indeed!Fat Bastard!Give me back my mojo, Fat Bastard!Maybe inside that Fat Bastard there's a thin bastard, trying to get outHold on, I have something very important to do.Sound as a pound, my spuds are boiling. Fancy a shag?C'mon, luv, let's hop on the good foot and do the bad thing!Right, the moon. I think I know someone who can give us a lift.Gor blimey, you'd have to be a rocket scientist to figure this stuff out.Felicity, if you get frightened, just hold my hand.To be honest it was terrifying. It felt like sitting on top of a bomb. As I punched through the atmosphere, I said 'Oh my God!' and I soiled myself.No, I mean I soiled myself just now when I said oh 'my God!'Mission control, the swinger has landed.This is one small step for man, but a giant step for shagging. Can you imagine it, baby, weightless? The permutations are mind-boggling.God Save the Queen.Shhh...Of course I did, baby, I got my mojo working overtime.Oh, behave!Poor little bugger. He's so small, he's like a dog or something.Poor little bugger. Felicity, be careful! Dr. Evil is still alive! Felicity?Alright, slap-head, turn around. Slowly.Felicity! What have you done to her?I've got my mojo back, man, I can do both.Hands off my joystick, baby.See, Dr. Evil I told you I could do both.Noooooo!Felicity! Felicity. Wake up! Wake up! Please God, don't take her away.Felicity, you have to understand, I thought I had my mojo back. This isn't fair.I love you, Felicity! I know I couldn't say it before, but I really do love you! Dr. Evil, I'll kill him!I have to commandeer this vehicle. Hey, aren't you Hutch?I'm going to kill you, you bastard!Really?How so?I didn't think that Felicity was going to die, man.Felicity!I choose love, baby.Felicity, I love you.That was another place and another time, baby.Sorry, baby, I got a little over- stimulated.What do we do?I don't have it!Uh-oh. I think I just got my mojo back. Really.Come with me, Felicity! It's the only way out!If I did, anyone can. Let's go, baby!Don't worry baby it takes some getting used to.

EVIL": {"raw_line": "This isn't over yet, Mr. Powers. I have one more trick up my sleeve, don't I Mr. Bigglesworth?Hello Scott, I'm back.They offered me a free makeover.Share?OK. I have a vestigial tail.It's more of a nub, really. The spine just goes on a little longer than it should. Also, I've dabbled. I mean, perform fellatio once and you're a poet, twice and you're a homosexual. I remember once I was being fisted by Sebastian Cabot- but here's where the story gets interesting. He was lactose-intolerant. He could eat red meat all night long, but one sip of milk and it was gastric hell. And I remember we were caught in fragrance delicto by Henry Kissinger, and you can imagine my humiliation at having Hank hear me say, \"Mr. French, no teeth.\" One of my greatest disappointments is that I never became a song and dance man. I could have been a quadruple threat, kind of like a despotic Ken Barry. Dancer, singer, actor, and I would possess nuclear weapons, the latter being the most threatening of the four. I once sat on a bus and tried to will myself a menstrual cycle. All I ended up with was a sense of failure and a mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth and perhaps a grudging respect for the weaker sex. I love toe cleavage. For the most part I distrust dogs. I slept in a horse once. It was quite roomy. On second thought, it was the Ritz. I named my left testicle 'piss' and my right testicle 'vinegar'. I wrote \"It's Raining Men\", or so the Christmas babies told me. Oh yes, I also made a Marzipan voodoo effigy of The Fonze while I was in coma after smoking some Peruvian prayer hash, but who at the end of the day can honestly say they haven't done that?No one talks to my boy that way!I'm OK, I'm OK.Come Scott, let's go to daddy's new evil lair.Oh good, Number Two, I do enjoy a good cuppa joe.Right. Perhaps you've confused me with someone who gives a shit. Might I remind you that I run the show here? I demand a little respect.Silence! I will not tolerate your insolence! Remember what happened last time.Frau Farbissina. Wie gehts is einen?How are things?Right on. Welcome, Unibrau.Oh, I know. I know.Welcome to my private army, Oedipus. Excited?Kiss your mother with that mouth?Of course you do.I have so few pleasures left to me, Number Two. The key to life is to rotate your vices. One day it's executions, another day it's creamy French cheese. It's like frickin' heroin.Cool.Breathtaking. I shall call him Mini- Me. Mini-Me, you will sit to my right.Come Mr. Bigglesworth!Mini-me, something to eat? No?With a White House intern!What, that already happened?This is ri-goddamn-diculous. Oh well, how about a frickin' time machine? Does the president have a time machine? Have I been scooped on that?Alright, time machine it is. As you know, every diabolical scheme I've hatched has been thwarted by Austin Powers. And why is that, ladies and gentlemen?No, because Austin Powers has \"mojo\".It's what the French call a certain 'I don't know what.'No, no, no.Why make trillions when we could make... Billions?Why think small is all I'm saying.Zip it. Unveil the time portal!Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the time portal. As you know, Austin Powers was frozen in 1967. Therefore, I time travel to 1969, two years after he was frozen. Security will be lax and I'll strike when he is totally helpless.No, Scott, Daddy has a score to settle. Austin Powers is the snake to my mongoose, or the mongoose to my snake. Either way it's bad, I don't know animals. But I do know this: This time it's personal. Frau, Number 2, I'll see you both in 1969. Come, Mini-Me.Ah, here we are Mini-Me, 1969. Number Two, you look very youthful and healthy. And Frau you look...right.OK, people, we now officially have a chair problem. If another one of these chairs hits me in the nuts, I'm gonna go postal. Mini-Me, I want you to meet Number Two.Mini-Me?Shy. Low blood sugar. Gentlemen, Phase Two is beginning. I have an operative inside the Ministry of Defense. By this time tomorrow, Austin Powers' mojo will be mine.Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!Well done, Fat Bastard. May I have the mojo?Right. Charming. Fat Bastard- you don't mind me calling you Fat Bastard do you?Alright, Fatty-Fat Bastard, the mojo?A gentlemen never discusses money.Vulgarity is no substitute for wit.Right. Bring in the money.Mini-Me, fetch.This is ri-goddamn-diculous, we have his mojo.Scott, what are you doing here?You had your chance, Scott. I already have someone created in my image. He's evil, he wants to take over the world, and he fits easily into most overhead storage bins. Has anyone seen Mini-Me? Mini-Me! Mini-Mouse? Mini-Driver? Hello! Mini Pearl? Can we put a frickin' bell on him or something?Gentlemen, phase three. We place a giant laser on the moon. Let me demonstrate. Where's my laser?Mini-Me, don't chew my laser. Not feeling well. He has an ear infection, but tit's OK. No? Nothing? Anyway, the laser is powerful enough to destroy every city on the planet at will. We'll turn the moon into what I like to call a \"Death Star\".What?What did you call me?Bless you? Anyways, since my \"death star\" laser was invented by the noted Cambridge physicist, Dr. Parsons. I thought we'd name it in his honor-- the Alan Parsons Project.What now?When you get your own evil empire, you can call it whatever you want. Gentlemen, allow me to demonstrate the awesome lethality of the Alan Parsons Project. Fire the laser!Actually, that was just footage from the 1996 blockbuster motion Picture Independence Day, but it would be a lot like that. What do you think, Scott?Shhhh!Shh! Shh-Shh. Shh-Shhhhhh-Shh. Shh- shh! It's Morse code. Let me decipher... it says 'shhhhh!'Ssssss...huuuuuh...Shhhhh!Fat Bastard, in addition to being extremely rotund, you're a vicious killer.It's an easy job. Without his mojo, Powers will be...powerless?Get me the President of the United States.Not what I want Mr. President, but I will receive. In 12 hours I will destroy Washington, DC with a giant laser.OK, Mini-Me, why don't you and the laser get a frickin' room. Honestly. I will destroy another major city every hour- that is, unless you pay me-One hundred billion dollars!Don't play games with me. The capitol will disappear if I don't receiveOne hundred billion dollars!Come on, Mr. President...\"Show me the money!\"\"Show me the money!\"You know, kwan? Show me the money? No? Nothing?Right. OK, see if you understand this: give me the money or I'm going to blow you to frickin' bits, OK?Talk to the hand!I did love that, though. Cuba Gooding Jr. was outstanding. Oscar speech, very touching.Yeah, baby. Very shagedelic. This isn't working. I don't feel anything.I was just... right. Would it kill you to frickin' knock?'WHAT IF GOD WAS ONE OF US? JUST A SLOB LIKE ONE OF US?'How tedious.Really?Right. I object to the last one on aesthetic grounds, but I don't care how you get Powers, just bring him to me. Ready Mini-Me? A one and a two and... ME, AND MY SHA-DOW STROLLING DOWNIt's the volcanic sulphurous emissions. We've put up some air fresheners.I'm just waiting to taunt my nemesis. I have so few pleasures, you know.Ah, Mr. Powers, Ms. Shagwell, welcome to my hollowed-out volcano.Yes, the only reason I'm keeping you alive is so you can feel the agony of watching my plan unfold.Oh, is that yours?You know what they say: finders keepers, loser weepers.Of course. Why?Oww! My stomach hurts!Take them away.You're going the right way for a smacked bottom, young man.I do actually. It's complicated. Usually it's illegal but this buddy of mine... but I digress. Fat Bastard, I'm leaving you in charge. I'm going up the moon to hold the world ransom with my giant laser, I shouldn't be long.He's tucked away safely in his cell. He's harmless without that mojo. Guard it with your life. Number Two, begin the countdown.Has anyone seen my gravity booties? Honestly, all I wanted was a frickin' moon base. Hello, we're on the moon, no gravity? Mini-Me? Are you alright?My frickin' mascot is stuck to the ceiling, OK? Not good. Papa not happy.Somebody get the stick. Hold on, Mini-Me. Begin laser-. Begin-Begin laser ignition sequence.Lunar alignment in 6 hours.Position the laser.Get me the President.Mr. President, your time is up. This is your last chance to pay 100 billion dollars or see Washington DC destroyed.Pay me 100 billion dollars or see Washington DC destroyed!How about now?The Capital will be destroyed-Could someone shut off that frickin' alarm? I'm trying to hold the free world hostage here. Honestly. WILL DESTROY WASHINGTON DC UNLESS YOU PAY ME-100 BILLION DOLLARS!Oh well, I guess you have one minute to- \"show me the money\"!Then I suppose you're up shit's crick without a paddle.Aren't you forgetting something?Don't worry, she's not dead... yet.It looks like you have a choice, Powers: save the world, or save your girlfriend.We'll see. Fire the laser!Damn you, Powers!Perhaps you spoke too soon.You make love to your wife out of duty, your mistress for pleasure, and a Roman boy for ecstasy. Shit.Before you do that, know this: Austin, I am... your... father.No. I can't back that up. I was just grasping at straws. I had nothing. But isn't it interesting, Mr. Powers, you really have become a product of the Nineties.You're more interested in your job as glorified policeman than you are in love. You won the battle, but I won the war. Love means nothing, you've proved it.What a cowardly response. I'm disappointed really. You have the power to go back in time and save her, but it means letting me go.Well, Mr. Powers, which is it going to be? Me or the girl?It looks like you have a choice: save the world, or save your girlfriend.Fire the laser!Good-bye, Mr. Powers, for the last time.", "clean_line": "isn mr powers trick sleeve mr

{"raw_line": "Hello, I'm Basil Exposition, head of British Intelligence.We'll send a man around immediately. How was your honeymoon?Ah women, who can understand them? Moving on, let's discuss your new case.You'll be doing a photo shoot. We know that one of the models is an ex- KGB agent selling top secret material to the highest bidder.Where is he? In here?Austin, I came as soon as I heard.What's wrong with your neck, Austin?We're going to run a few tests, Austin. Don't worry, old friend, we'll get to the bottom of this.Alright, everyone, we're done.Agent Haggerty was the test, Austin. Not only were you actually reading an article in that Playboy, but a candy-stripe nurse offering to give you a sponge bath didn't so much as turn your head.I'm sorry, Austin, I'm afraid it's true: you've lost your mojo.I'm afraid that's not possible, Austin. You see, Dr. Evil has returned.Again.We have evidence that Dr. Evil has developed a time machine.Our researcher noticed that these photos from the archives have changed. That means Dr. Evil is traveling back in time and creating alliances with each decade's most despised villains.Our data indicates that Dr. Evil is in the year 1969. Luckily, we also have a time travel device. After years of research we've developed a machine that will transport you back to the Sixties.That's what they'd like you to believe.I suggest you don't worry about those things and just enjoy yourself.Good luck, Austin.Hello, Austin. What's wrong with your voice?Austin! Things are heating up, so I thought it best to contact you in disguise. Felicity, your plan worked. You and Austin track Fat Bastard back to Dr. Evil.Yes, and we're starting to pick up the signal now.Well, thanks to your effort, Felicity, we now know that-Anyway, you two follow the signal back to Dr. Evil's headquarters and then-Never mind, Austin, you two have work to do. You must find Dr. Evil.Austin, you have achieved lunar orbit. How was that lift-off?Happens all the time in that situation.Prepare for moon landing. We only have one hour until Dr. Evil fires the laser!Gentlemen, Austin has landed on the moon. We'll soon know whether he has succeeded or whether the world will be destroyed!He did it, he saved the world! Of course, I thought he might.Peters!Any word from Austin?Austin, if you can hear me, use the time portal! There's no time to get to the lunar module! Use the time portal!", "clean_line": "hello basil exposition head british intelligence ll send man immediately honeymoon ah women understand moving let discuss new case ll photo shoot know models ex kgb agent selling secret material highest bidder austin came soon heard wrong neck austin going run tests austin worry old friend ll alright agent haggerty test austin actually reading article playboy candy stripe nurse offering sponge bath turn head sorry austin afraid true ve lost mojo afraid possible austin dr evil returned evidence dr evil developed time machine researcher noticed photos archives changed means dr evil traveling time creating alliances decade despised villains data indicates dr evil year luckily time travel device years research ve developed machine transport sixties like believe suggest worry things enjoy good luck austin hello austin wrong voice austin things heating thought best contact disguise felicity plan worked austin track fat bastard dr evil yes starting pick signal thanks effort felicity know follow signal dr evil headquarters mind austin work dr evil austin achieved lunar orbit lift happens time situation prepare moon landing hour dr evil fires laser gentlemen austin landed moon ll soon know succeeded world destroyed saved world course thought peters word austin austin hear use time portal time lunar module use time portal"}, "FELICITY": {"raw_line": "Care for a ride?It was your Beetle. Get in.Austin Powers, I presume?Felicity Shagwell, CIA. Shagwell by name, Shag-very-Well by reputation.Grab the wheel, would you?Well, Austin, I think this time you may have met your match.I was talking about me.Yes, I rather fancy a grind.Mmm, lower.Wait, something's itching me.That's better.Oh, that was so relaxing. Felicity stretches very sexily.I think I'm ready for bed.No, I'm ready for bed.No, I want to have sex with you, Austin.I've studied everything about you- your methods, your accomplishments, your preferences. You're the reason I became a spy. Now, I've waited two years to meet you, so I say we get busy making up for lost time.Oh.Austin, don't worry. I know just the man to help you. He's my guru. Ringo recommended him and he's the best.There he is. That's my guru.Guru, I'd like you to meet Austin Powers.Guru, we need some advice.He's impotent!Who's Vanessa?Let's split up and scope the scene.No, but I bet it really hurts.Well you can start by buying me a drink.You're Thor? I'm tho thor I can hardly thit.Yeah, I heard she broke it off.Look at that.Until recently he worked security for the MOD, but we think he might be a double agent, possibly for Dr. Evil.We've noticed that his lifestyle has changed dramatically. He's made a lot of cash purchases, he's hanging out with foxes half his age, and he's becomes quite a fixture on the London party circuit.I don't know, but it looks like he's splitting.I'll follow him. You see what you can get out of the girl. We'll rendezvous later.I love a man with a large appetite.I never would have thought that a man of such tremendous girth could be such a, um, creative and sensuous lover!Austin, tell me about the Nineties.Not details, just what it's like. You know, what's the scene? Where's it at?Sounds awful.You? Married? What about the sexual revolution?No, not until I get a little more 'experience' under my belt.What is it! Is it Fat Bastard?Austin, look.1965, actually. You posed as a Dutch cheese expert to stop Dr. Evil from poisoning the world's water supply.I've studied your file, Austin. I want to be a trailblazer, just like you. The Seventies are right around the corner. It's going to be a glorious time for fashion and music and technology-- it won't be long before every flying car has its own 8-track.The CIA has always been a boy's club until now. Well move over, this chick's taking over.Austin, your voice!No thanks.I planted a homing device on him last night.I shagged him, I shagged him rotten.Yes, Austin, we needed that information.Austin, it almost sounds like you're jealous.We're obviously on the right track. It looks like Fat Bastard is-on an island in the middle of the ocean.Can I have a look?Question is, how do we get in?Austin, did you hear me?Where are the topographical maps that Basil drew up?Good Lord, Austin, what sort of things do you put in there?How do you manage to fit it all in?Here we go, one hammer. It's amazing how much this duffel bag will hold.Do you want everything to go back in?It's my job, Austin. You of all people should understand that. Marakesh, 1962. Rome, 1964. Tokyo, 1966. I know your record backwards and forwards. You've had more sex on the job than a Swedish stewardess.Are you OK?Dr. Evil, do you like real estate?Now you've got a couple of achers.How are we going to get out of here?Austin, that is it! I don't know what happened to you in the Nineties, but I'm still here, in the Sixties, and I still swing! Don't try to lay your hang-ups on me just because you lost your mojo! That one hurts.I'm sorry, Austin, that was a cheap shot.But the Austin Powers I knew was wild and crazy and free. He could never be jealous.Was that your wife?Listen, Austin, I can't pretend to understand everything you've gone through, but I trust you. I'll make you a deal: if we get out of here alive, I'll give monogamy a try.Yes, silly.We need to lure the guard inside and get his key.That might work, but how about this?What do you think of these, my man?It's very hot in here, don't you think?It's very hot in here, don't you think?Austin!If you want something done...Where's your mojo, Austin?Who said anything about fighting?Hold on, let me ask you one question.Are you happy?You didn't answer my question, are you happy?Are you happy?How do you feel?Austin, we don't have time.Dr. Evil's taken his laser to the moon. The world is in danger.Yaaaaa-hoooo!Basil, it was amazing!Naughty boy!Let's find Dr. Evil.Austin, you've done it! You got Dr. Evil!Austin, I'm going ahead. Cover my rear!Don't worry about me Austin. You've got to save the world!But I thought-Can't. Breathe.Use your mojo!Trust me, you do!Austin, you did it!Austin, you had it all along. No one can take your, mojo away from you!Austin, you have to get to the time portal!Austin, will I fit in the Nineties?Sorry!I'm as healthy as a horse.And I love you.Absolutely not.", "clean_line": "care ride beetle austin powers presume felicity shagwell cia shagwell shag reputation grab wheel austin think time met match talking yes fancy grind mmm lower wait itching better oh relaxing felicity stretches sexily think ready bed ready bed want sex austin ve studied methods accomplishments preferences reason spy ve waited years meet busy making lost time oh austin worry know man help guru ringo recommended best guru guru like meet austin powers guru need advice impotent vanessa let split scope scene bet hurts start buying drink thor tho thor hardly thit yeah heard broke look recently worked security mod think double agent possibly dr evil ve noticed lifestyle changed dramatically lot cash purchases hanging foxes half age fixture london party circuit know looks like splitting ll follow girl ll rendezvous later love man large appetite thought man tremendous girth um creative sensuous lover austin tell nineties details like know scene sounds awful married sexual revolution little experience belt fat bastard austin look actually posed dutch cheese expert stop dr evil poisoning world water supply ve studied file austin want trailblazer like seventies right corner going glorious time fashion music technology won long flying car track cia boy club chick taking austin voice thanks planted homing device night shagged shagged rotten yes austin needed information austin sounds like jealous obviously right track looks like fat bastard island middle ocean look question austin hear topographical maps basil drew good lord austin sort things manage fit hammer amazing duffel bag hold want job austin people understand marakesh rome tokyo know record backwards forwards ve sex job swedish stewardess ok dr evil like real estate ve got couple achers going austin know happened nineties sixties swing try lay hang ups lost mojo hurts sorry austin cheap shot austin powers knew wild crazy free jealous wife listen austin pretend understand ve gone trust ll deal alive ll monogamy try yes silly need lure guard inside key work think man hot think hot think austin want mojo austin said fighting hold let ask question happy answer question happy happy feel austin time dr evil taken laser moon world danger yaaaaa hoooo basil amazing naughty boy let dr evil austin ve got dr evil austin going ahead cover rear worry austin ve got save world thought breathe use mojo trust austin austin mojo away austin time portal austin fit nineties sorry healthy horse love absolutely"}}}
