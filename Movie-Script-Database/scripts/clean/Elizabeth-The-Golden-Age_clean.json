With that she smiles, and sees Bess's answering reflected smile.Now you have smile lines too.A puddle... The guards take up their positions once more. Bess throws Raleigh a quick smile as she follows the royal party. His answering shrug says: I tried. He picks up the cloak, and stands gazing after the Queen.A puddle...You have the plans for the new docks?Let me think on it. What if enemy ships should sail up the Thames? Can the docks be closed?What again?Still mad, you mean. . Where's Bess? The courtier presents a third portrait.Late again, Bess.Given. Once.My suitors.More your age than mine, Bess.

I have a secret. lowering her voice) I pretend there's a pane of glass - eine Glasscheibe - between me and them. he moves one hand before her face, indicating an imaginary pane of glass. As she looks, she sees Bess staring at someone - follows her gaze - and is amused to find that the object of her attention is also Raleigh.They can see me, but they can't hear me, or touch me. You should try it.Bess.He interests me. Talk to him.Him.His highness is tired after his journey.(You play the game very well, my young friend. But don't you(You're thinking, perhaps, thatHis highness the Archduke informs me that my charms overwhelm him. He will retire to his private quarters to rest.He's a sweet boy. I don't want him hurt by your schemes.I suspect him of being a professional charmer. Am I right?There are duller professions. And what is it he hopes to gain by his charms?So it is. We shall let him come again.Let them wait! Go on, Mr Raleigh. You were hoping.The Queen does not have a private life.The Queen lives for her people. You will therefore forgive me, sir, if after much thought and prayer I decline your offer of marriage.Mr. Raleigh.I like your immensities. Your ocean is an image of eternity, I think. Such great spaces make us small. Do we discover the New World, Mr Raleigh, or does the New World discover us?I like you, Mr Raleigh.You know, of course, that when I like a man, I reward him.And what have you to say about it? RIs the mission not the man?Go on.Now you become dull.You have - the stronger horse.The Queen does not give way to others. Raleigh stops his horse. Elizabeth rides on up to him and then past him. Raleigh secretly spurs his horse. The horse springs forward, ahead of her.Have you ever known your place, Mr. Raleigh? She urges her horse forward, forcing Raleigh to catch up.I'm surprised you're not married yet.And can sailors not be lovers?Ah, I see. You like love betterWhen I marry, I marry for my country.You've yet to meet your equal? Raleigh hesitates. She understands him.You want a friend, not just an equal. You want someone to share your joy when you're happy.Ah yes. I know all about it. There. I'm rested now. She turns her horse around in the direction from which they came. Raleigh follows.We can be something to eachAlright, then. I will.See! You lie! You don't want me on your ship at all. You're a liar! Elizabeth now takes in Bess.Would you like to go to sea, Bess?Oh, do they?Men have needs?Then let them stay on land and see to their needs. Mr Raleigh is eager to sail away to his infant colony, Bess. We must persuade him to stay a little longer, mustn't we?No, don't stop. I like it.Is it true, Bess? That I've never known the simple pleasure of being liked for myself?Is anybody ever liked just for themselves? Are you? I doubt it. Men like you because you're pretty. And because you have the ear of the Queen.Him too. He likes you because he wants my favour. You do realise that?And the other thing too, of course. But all men want that. Male desire confers no B distinction.Filled with declarations of love?If she wants my love, let her deserve it. Refused.Mr Raleigh. I've kept you waiting.There is always other business. But I have been waiting too. Walsingham enters.Yes, Walsingham?Forgive me, sir. As you see, my time is not my own.What do you know of the Enterprise of England, Ambassador?It's a plan for the invasion of my country. Two armies landing on the coasts of Sussex and -And Norfolk. Mary Stuart is to be set free, and placed on the English throne.I refer to this plan as the Enterprise of England. It should more accurately be called `la Empresa di Inglaterra', because it's a Spanish plan. The plan of your king, my one-time brother-in- law, Philip II, to attack my country.You will leave my presence, sir! Go back to Spain! Tell Philip that I don't fear him, or his priests, or his armies. Tell him if he wants to shake his little fist at us, we're ready to give him such a bite he'll wish he'd kept his hands in his pockets.I too can command the wind, sir. I have a hurricane in me that will strip Spain bare, if you dare to try me!What are you staring at? Lower your eyes! I am the Queen!You ask permission to go.You plan to return to the New World. To your colony. For two, or three, or four years.That is a long time.But you're quite wrong. You are needed here. I have decided to appoint you Captain of my personal guard.Kneel.Rise, Sir Walter Raleigh.If it's such an honour, why are you staring at your boots?Now you stare at the wall. Am I so old and hideous that you can't even look me in the face?My friend, forgive me. I'm a vain and foolish woman. At court it's all a game. I like to be admired. I require it. I grow accustomed to it. But it's all - nothing.The storm clouds are gathering, my friend. Please don't leave me now.ell, Dr Dee. Here I am again, back to consult the wisdom of your charts.Princes of the female gender.Yes, Dr Dee. I am following you. So what does it all mean?Which empire is to rise, and which is to fall?He means, Will I be assassinated?You see, Francis? This is a mystery. He has no patience with mysteries. WFrancis. Leave us for a moment.And the private life of this prince of the female gender, Dr Dee? What do the stars foretell there? Or is this too a mystery?Do the stars not foretell matters of state?An art, not a science. I understand.Let him throw you round, Bess. You can trust him.Sometimes. Do you think that wrong?To tell you the truth, Mr Raleigh, there are times when I'm tired of being always in control.What?Do you say so?Bess, you must try a dance with Mr Raleigh. He's eager to show us his skill.Oh, it's very simple.You stand like this, with your hands firmly clasped here - and when she jumps, on the eighth step, you swing her round - once, twice, three times - and you're back to the beginning. What could be simpler?So come, Mr Raleigh. Take your position. I am to be obeyed.Hold her tight. I don't want her dropped. to the musicians) Play!Leave her alone, Walsingham. I want both of them left alone.They say she's taller than me. Her hair is chestnut in colour. Her eyes are hazel. They say she's beautiful. But people lie. They say I am beautiful. A dismissive shrug. Clearly she does not think herself beautiful.Yes, it's true. I've read her letters. I too was a prisonerI can be merciful. But sheYou used to be gentler, Bess.Must die? Mary Stuart must die? Where is it written? Who dares toDon't preach at me, old man. Look at you! You can hardly stand. Go home to your wife. Go home to your bed.The law is for common men, not for princes.My friend.Did Bess bid you come? Have youMy duty? Was it my father's duty to murder my mother? I would beYes, I am afraid. I am always afraid.You understand me well.Do we? Do we really?I owe England my life. Don't ask for my soul.I want it stopped!No! It must be stopped!Not me!And I ordered her execution. I murdered God's anointed Queen. And now God's most dutiful son makes holy war to punish me.Yes... Go...`Think you that there is any certainty in the affairs of mankind, when you know that one swift hour can destroy the greatest among us?'Boethius.Thank you for coming at this late hour.We're at war.

My thoughts turn dark. Don't you ever think that one day, perhaps one day soon, you too will die?Today. Tonight.I wish -In some other time, in some other world, could you have loved me?Then there's... something you could do for me - something I've not known for a very long time - if you felt so inclined -A kiss?Air! I must have air!This Spanish Armada is at sea carrying an army of ten thousand men. The Duke of Parma has fifteen thousand men on the French coast.Our forces defend the ThamesYou may observe, Walsingham, that I don't see my way with only one eye. Nor do I hop along on only one leg. Why then would I rely on only one source of information?Where is she?Bess! Bess Throckmorton! Bess comes running from the far end.Tell me! Is it true? Are you married? Are you with child? Are you WITH CHILD? Bess stands before her with her head bowed.You traitress! You dare to have secrets from me! I am your Queen! You ask my permission before you rut - before you marry - before you breed! My bitches wear my collars! Do you hear me? How dare you be with child!This is no time for mercy! That's what you said to me. I don't forget. But you showed mercy, Walsingham! Go to your traitor brother, and leave me to my business! alsingham turns white. Elizabeth is back berating Bess.Is it his child? Tell me! Say it! Is the child his? Tell me! Say it! Is it his?This gentleman has seduced a lady under my care. This lady has married without my consent. These are offences punishable by law. Arrest him.The fall of an empire, you told me. Did you mean the English empire? Because by God, England will not fall while I am Queen! If that's your prophecy, sir, prophesy again!I will not be a toy of the fates! Have I not faced an assassin's bullet and lived?You're a wise man, Dr Dee.My lords, I can offer you no words of comfort.Labourers are to leave the fields and take up arms. The harvest must wait.Release all prisoners. England is their country too.Release Raleigh. He is forgiven... As I too pray to be forgiven...Leave me. All of you.Are our ships at sea? Has the fleet left Plymouth? That can't be so hard to know.With what gain?Then we must act.My loving people! We see the sails of the enemy approaching. We hear the Spanish guns over the water.While we stand together no invader shall pass. Let them come with all the armies of Hell, they will not pass. The crowd gives another mighty cheer.So let us sound the advance andOne empire will rise, and one will fall...Francis. My old friend.I know it, old friend. Don't leave me now.You always did do as you pleased, whether I wanted it or not. I've no doubt you'll do as you please now.When was the birth?The mother is well?And the child?Your Elizabeth has a child.

That can be my reward.I think it must be hard for so great a Queen to know the simple pleasure of being liked for herself.Mine!Whoa! Whoa! Forgive me, majesty. My horse doesn't know his place yet Elizabeth looks at him, amused, intrigued.I'm a sailor, majesty.Some...I would want someone who knows me as I am. Now it is Elizabeth who hesitates. He understands her as well.So why don't you?I'm afraid that's not possible. Women bring bad luck on board ship.Lock up a hundred men in a space smaller than this room, for months at a time - Men have needs. A beautiful woman like you would drive us all mad.You think all I want is money.You think I'm a cynical adventurer, with little breeding and less education. You're wrong. I'm a cynical adventurer with little breeding and an excellent education.You have more important concernsThe Queen has sent you to me.Tell the Queen that I willI need no assurances. I'm no courtier and never have been. I've lost my appetite for playing games that it seems I'm too stupid to understand.You call me unfair!Yes, majesty.If your majesty grants me your royal warrant.There's nothing left for me to do here. At sea I know what I'm to do, I know the risks, I know the rewards. Here -Captain of your - !This is too great an honour.You know why. He raises his eyes, but he still doesn't look at her.Why do you talk like a fool when you're anything but a fool?I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you.Something has distressed you.So you did.That's necessity. That's the world we live in.If you knew him well, you will have sensed the truth.He was hoping to use you. You didThere, now. He wipes away a tear from her cheek. In desperate need of comfort, she throws herself into his arms. He holds herWe're all mortal, Bess. We do what we can. He strokes her cheek. She meets his eyes, filled with gratitude. She takes the hand that touches her face and moves it to her lips. She kisses it, still holding his eyes. He draws her back into his arms, and they kiss. Suddenly they're kissing eagerly, greedily, their long pent- up passion released at last.You like your ladies to jump at your command?No, no. You're the Queen. You are to be obeyed.Nonsense.You don't mean a word of it. You eat and drink control.No skill at all, majesty. I don't know the steps.As your majesty wishes.Has she asked for me?My Queen.No. You don't need me to instruct you in your duty.Since when were you so afraid?You fear your soul will be touched. Royalty is close to immortality. Kill a Queen - and queens are mortal.We mortals have many weaknesses. We feel too much. Hurt too much. And all too soon, we die. But we do have the chance of love.The Consolation of Philosophy.May the Lord God preserve England's Queen.He'll not burn England.Never!The closer I come to death, the more I want to live. The hungrier I am for life.Why be afraid of tomorrow? Today's all we have, and all we know.Now.I've never known a woman like you.I know only one world. In this world, I have loved you.What is this, Bess?You're pregnant?When were you planning to leave?Am I not to see you again? What's to become of the child? Bess -All I know is nothing's as it should be.Of course I remember.Oh, Bess...With this ring I thee wed. With my body I thee worship...... and with all my worldly goods H I thee endow.In the name of the father -And of the Son -And of the Holy Spirit.Amen.This is not the Queen I love and serve.What news? Is the fleet at sea?What news?And the fleet?All but me.Tell the Queen I will join myOur ships may be smaller butBreak their formation and we haveWe have the wind in our favour. Do we go?How many ships are burning?Not enough. He turns his face towards the coast of England. He speaksour nights ago.Thank God.My son is well.Yes.As any man can be.

Please.Here's my noble jailer, come to smack my hand. She holds out one hand to be smacked. The other hand holds the letter out of sight.Have I sinned again, sir?Oh, you jailer.

What if I wish to write a love letter? Is Elizabeth to be sent a copy? Is she so starved of lovers that she must feed on mine?Tormentor! Is that Elizabeth's order too? That you torment and mock me? She turns to go, but stops before leaving the room: bitter, haughty, not deigning to look back.They say she's a beautiful woman.She's called the virgin queen. Why is that, sir? Can it be thatMy friend, forgive me. You are my friend, are you not?I shall send no more letters. I shall stay here quietly, in my prison. With you.The gentlemen are ready.

What has any of this to do with me?Your master?Traitors. I'm surrounded by traitors. Who am I to trust?Only my little one...Who are you to sit in judgement on me? By what authority do you condemn a Queen? God alone has made me what I am. He is my only judge. Raise your law above God's law, and what law remains? In your vanity and ignorance you set loose the monster of misrule. You know neither who you are nor what you do. But I know who I am.
