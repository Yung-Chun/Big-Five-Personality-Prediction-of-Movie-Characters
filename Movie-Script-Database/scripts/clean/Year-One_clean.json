I understand if you're afraid--No, really, it's all right. I just thought you might be curious why we can eat everything else that walks, crawls, swims, flies, or grows in the ground, but not that particular fruit. And I thought you might be the kind of man who's willing to take a chance and start thinking for himself, but I guess I was wrong. She glares defiantly at Zed, then starts to walk away. It's not Paradise anymore. Then like every man that ever lived and will ever live, he caves.You first.We both bite at the same time.

I'm a slave, remember?Wait here until you're sent for.Of course not. You were just chosen again. Maybe after you and the Princess get together you can start thinking about someone beside yourself. She walks off before he can answer. Zed shakes his head, looks around the room, then STARTS walking past a row of \"LIVING STATUES,\" semi-nude men and women on pedestals covered head to toe in gold body paint, frozen in heroic postures that show off their beautiful bodies. Zed looks closely at one beautiful nude \"GODDESS\", then furtively reaches out and fondles her breast. The goddess slaps his hand, then resumes her pose.Forget it. Maya sees A GUARD watching them and reverts to her slave attitude. MAYA The Princess awaits you.Good luck.She sees him and starts to revive.Zed!You're incredible, you know that?Where will you go now?Are you going alone?I'll get my things.

Tangerine? Umm, mango? Kiwi? Peach? She shakes her head coyly. He starts darting from tree to tree, hopefully pointing out various options. She follows him.Okay, don't tell me-- papaya? Pomegranate? Lemon? Lime? Kumquat? Uh, cock? Cockfruit?Watermelon? Honeydew? Grapes?Starfruit, casaba-- tangelo?(he doesn't even like herBecause that's the fruit we don't eat! It's forbidden.Because we don't! It's a rule! That's the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. You don't eat from that one. Nobody ever has.Stop saying why not! I told you-- it's a rule.No-- yeah-- I don't know. We don't have that many rules. In fact, we only have one rule-- DON'T EAT THATI'm not \"afraid\"--Okay! Fine! You want to try the Good and Evil fruit, you got it. He rips two ripe fruits from a low-hanging bough and hands her one. They both stare at the fruit.No way! It was your idea. You go first.Okay. Ready? One-- two-- three! Zed chomps down hard and takes a big bite, but Maya fakes him out and stops before her teeth break the skin. ZED Got me. That's a good move. I'm going to steal it. He starts chewing and she watches as he gets his first taste of Good and Evil. Then his face contorts in disgust and he spits it out. ZED Yuchh! That's horrible. Yecch, ptui! Ughh. He frantically wipes the inside of his mouth with his fingers, trying to get the terrible taste out.Yes! I'm saying it's not good! He grabs his belly as his stomach starts to cramp. Then a loud bowel sound and his eyebrows shoot up. ZED Oh, no--Do me a favor. Just kill me.I couldn't help myself! Maya was just staring at me with those pouty eyes-- and those perky breasts-- opposable thumbs. And how about the name? \"The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil\"? You don't think that sounds tempting? They should've just called it \"The Tree with the Fruit that Tastes Like Shit.\" Then for sure nobody would eat it. Zed notices a VILLAGER squatting in the bushes right behind his dwelling. ZED Hey! Squanto! Give me a break, would ya'! You got the whole forest! Why does everyone have to crap right behind my hut?I don't see it. I mean she's cute, but I don't think I'd lay with her.which was a big mistake. I see that now. You think it won't be awkward the next morning but-- trust me, you just want to rip your eyeballs out. Listen, if you want to impress Eema, tonight at the feast, do the fertility dance with her, then drag her back to your hut.So you give her a little tap on the head. Women respond to that--I wouldn't read too much into that. She kisses, then tongues the spear tip. ZED Okay, that might mean something. The hunter Marlak walks by and stops. He's clearly half a rung lower on the human evolutionary scale.Yes, Marlak. Very observant. I was indisposed. Got that intestinal thing that's been going around. Marlak grunts and examines the primitive line drawings on the walls of Zed's hut.It's a bear.Yeah. Like you'd know.That-- would be an antelope-- or a deer-- a deerpalope.How could it be Maya? It's just some lines on a skin.Your woman? I'm not sure dragging her into the bushes kicking and screaming means you have an actual \"thing\" going. Marlak cuffs him hard on the side of the head.Hey! Nice supra-orbital ridge, fartface!Hey, Oh? Did it ever occur to you that there may be more to life than this?No, I'm serious.We're born into thisworld, we hunt, we gather, we eat,we sleep, we make babies----but why? What's the point?No. Last night I couldn't sleep, so I just laid there looking up at the sky, counting the stars. There were over seventy. Kinda makes you think, doesn't it?Really? I've been thinking about it ever since I ate that fruit. Don't you ever wonder what's on the other side of the mountains?But what if it doesn't? What if it just goes on and on forever? Or what if it's round? (he picks up a roundSorry!Do it, man! Go dance for her.Are you kidding? Go! Jackal Dance! Oh summons his courage, gets up and crosses to where the girls are sitting. Zed makes subtle eye contact with Maya, waggles his eyebrows and licks his lips. She laughs and looks away. Oh starts dancing timidly right in front of Eema, subtly jerking his pelvis, trying to be cool. Eema just stares at him for a moment, then goes back to talking to her friends. Oh looks over at Zed for help. Zed mimes clonking her on the head. Oh picks up a wooden club and hits Eema right on the noggin. However, instead of submitting, she gets really pissed, stands up and decks him with one punch.Excuse me, hunter coming through.For your information I was in line and I just stepped out to chew some food for an elderly lady. Suddenly a SPEAR is thrust inches from his face, stopping him. It's Marlak, who towers over Zed. His cohort, ENMEBARAGESI, short and stout, stands beside him.Oh, really? And what if I called Enmebaragesi a liar?Calm down. I said \"what if\"-- it was a hypothetical. Marlak gets right in Zed's face.No, you just made it harder on myself! Okay, fine, you got me. (gingerly moves the spearIsn't that what we're talking about? Maya rolls her eyes.Oh, that! Yeah! I did eat the fruit. I was just kidding about humping Maya. Marlak knocks Zed to the ground. The DRUMMING stops. Oh comes running over and gets between Marlak and Zed.Look, Marlak, this is crazy. You're two of me. I'm not gonna fight you over a girl, okay? Zed starts to walk away but quickly pivots and throws a WILD HAYMAKER at Marlak who easily ducks it, and it hits an unsuspecting Enmebaragesi squarely in the nose. Zed And let that be a lesson to your big friend- Marlak grabs Zed, lands two solid punches to Zed's mid- section, and then clocks him with a vicious right that sends him sprawling to the ground.One bite! What's the big deal?I've always had trouble with the Great Turtle Theory-- too many unexplained gaps.Really? How screwed? Like I knew it was a rule but I'm a little fuzzy on the exact details.Where am I supposed to go?I don't want to seem ungrateful or anything, but you wouldn't happen to have any arrows, would you? An arrow zips in and sticks in the post next to his head.Yes, or gatherer-- but there's got to be more to life than this-- Kinda hard to concentrate with that rhythmic drumming, fellas. The Hunters keep the insistent beat, their gaze fixed on Zed. ZED Anyways, I'm going away, not because you're forcing me to-- which you are-- but because I choose to. Yes, I ate from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil-- major misunderstanding on my part-- and believe me I'm not recommending it unless you're interested in a very powerful laxative-- but it got me thinking about some pretty heavy stuff -- life questions, you know. So I'm out of here, and anyone who wants to join me is welcome. He looks around the circle and sees Maya. She sees Marlak staring at her and averts her eyes. ZEDNo, you don't.How can you see me if I'm not here?Okay, then tell me this-- who's standing right behind you?Was it my speech?But the speech was pretty good, right? I mean, even I was moved and I was the one speaking.This is nice, out here, the two of us.Come on, those hunters are idiots. In an hour they'll forget the whole thing.You know what we should do? You and me should kill the biggest boar ever-- just huge!-- and take it back to the village. Just to show them. And we won't let anyone else eat it. They'll have to watch us eat it.Oh!Don't move a muscle.I don't know. There's two different opinions on this one. Some say run, some say don't.I'm going to-- RUN! He sprints off and the cougar pounces right on oh.You really should put some maggots on those scratches. They look pretty deep.Because I honestly thought he'd go for me. I thought I was doing you a favor. Apparently not appreciated.You didn't have to come with me, you know. I didn't ask you to come.Yes, that's a technique of public speaking, but I didn't ask you specifically. You chose to come. You gotta take some responsibility for that. And there's no point coming if you're just gonna keep whining about every little-- cougar that attacks you. You want some or not?You making your own fire?You're still coming?Say what you want, but that was no accident. You don't see a pattern here?Yeah, but why? Why'd the cougar go for you and not me? Why did you fall and I didn't? Hard to believe it's all just random. Think aboutYes! There! He drops to one knee and examines something in the bushes. Zed They stopped here to poop. Look.Four men, maybe five. And a child-- or a small women maybe.Looks like they had some nuts-- dried fruit-- some kind of green leafy vegetable--(getting painfully to hisWhat do you guys do?Okay, boys, that's enough. We just want to--We're not really that insulted--Boys, boys! You're brothers! Let's just relax and-- Cain uses the distraction to sneak-punch Abel and the fight is on. They start throwing wild punches, then clinch and wrestle each other to the ground.Just let them settle it. Cain picks up a good-size rock and strikes Abel on the head with all his might. Abel falls heavily to the ground and lies there, not moving. Cain stands over him, breathing hard. ZEDNothing! Cain stares at Abel, still inert on the ground.Hey! What do you mean \"we\"? I don't want to play the blame game, but you're the one who hit him.We didn't know you were going to kill him--Did I say that?Unfortunately we already have dinner plans.What are the big round things for?Wow! That is like the greatest invention since the vagina. Cain whips the oxen and they lumber forward. Oh screams as the HEAVY WHEELS ROLL OVER HIS FEET.Thanks, but I'm kind of staying away from fruit for the time being. Zed gives Cain a subtle, acquiescent nod as Adam ushers them into his crude dwelling.Yeah, that's got to be pretty vexing. A Bergmanesque gloom fills the hovel as Adam muses sullenly on his sorry circumstances.Wow. That's kind of a downer isn't it?Boy, I hope not.I'm waiting for the punchline.Yeah, there you go. Oh looks at Seth.And that's a good way to be. In fact, I'm kind of surprised a pretty girl like you is sleeping alone anyway. I would've thought guys would be lined up at the door.Maybe you just haven't met the right one.I don't even know what that means. What does that mean?(stares at her for a longWhy would they blame us?Look at all these people! And this stuff! Oh approaches a bakery stand and stares hungrily at the bread.Yeah, we're gonna need money. What's money? They see a crowd at the center of the market gathered around a raised platform. SLAVES IN SHACKLES are lined up on the raised wooden platform while CUSTOMERS examine those waiting to be auctioned. The AUCTIONEER brings up a fnuscular male slave in a loincloth. ZED It's Marlak! Marlak's hands are bound and he's restrained by a chain attached to a thick leather collar around his neck.Eema! Maya! The women embrace him with relief and excitement.What happened? How did you get here?Yeah, this one looks pretty good-- He starts prodding, poking and squeezing Maya's arm like he's buying fruit. Oh takes the opportunity to fondle Eema's breasts. She punches him. Zed Ooh, feisty! So how does this work if we want them? The slave trader notes Zed's peasant clothes.You still think it's all just a coincidence? All of us here right now, at this particular place, at this particular time?I'm not sure yet, but I'm starting to believe that everything happens for a reason. Like, why did I eat the forbidden fruit?What do you mean \"which\" omnipotent force? How many omnipotent forces could there be?Work with me-- I'm just speculating here. Let's call this force \"God\"; and let's say this \"God\" is controlling everything. Maybe God wanted me to have the knowledge of good and evil.Don't you get what I'm saying? What if we've been chosen?Well, no offense, but it's possible that I was chosen and you all just happened to be there.A chosen doesn't need to be strong. I'm big this way.Not my face, my brain. It's enormous. I'm the smartest guy in the village.What?! Which one of us is smarter?Oh yeah, then why are we free and you're chained up?Sit tight. I'm going to get you out of here. Do you trust me?Fair enough. She gives him an encouraging hug, then Zed and Oh cross to Cain and the slave trader.I never trusted that guy.It's not like I want to be a slave or anything, but this is embarrassing!Look, I want you to know I blame myself for everything that happened.It wasn't my very first thought, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't up there.Shit! He leaps to his feet, looks around desperately, and sees nothing but a vast wasteland in every direction.I have no idea.Will you stop being so negative? I got your back, man. Who saved you from those lions when you were a baby? They were going to pounce, had you surrounded. Took the mama lion-- BAM!-- kneed her right in the face. Papa lion comes flying at me-- BAM!-- dropped an elbow, knocked his ass out.Yeah, because nobody else was there. You're lucky I was walking by.We've got to keep moving. I've got you, buddy-- just like always. He puts Oh over his shoulder and stumbles on.What do you mean, nothing? You were just going to kill him!Not to him, I'm guessing. Isaac nods gratefully.What do you think?I am Zed and this is Oh, sons of-- people you wouldn't know.Sodom and Gomorrah? Never been there. But I've heard of them.i didn't know that. What kind of abomination are we talking about?Abominable.Really. Tell me more.We just want to know so we can avoid them.Abraham, I'm a little worried about the city being destroyed.His name is praise and love his whole graciousness--You know, Abe, it's late, and we've all had a lot to drink, and I know this whole foreskin thing sounds like a good idea now, but you may just want to sleep on it. we could always cut 'em off in the morning, but if we do it now, there's just no putting it back on later.To the city. I have to find Maya.And you're going to listen to him? You think he's more chosen than me?Yes, and he also wanted to give his dick a little trim.You don't even know where we're going.No. Your dad specifically said Sodom and Gomorrah were evil.No! I told you, that's not where we're going.Fine. They stand there for less than a beat. ZED Okay, you win. Take us to Sodom. Isaac takes a couple of steps to the top of a rise and points off in the distance.I knew it was right around here.You shouldn't be smoking either.Where? Back to the penis-cutter? Besides, Eema and Maya might be in there. You want to get them out before the city's destroyed, don't you? Isaac impatiently grabs a big rock and starts banging on the door.Get help! Tell your father!I kinda get why his dad wanted to kill him. The sentries drag them through a small door cut into a corner of the city gates.We're not really Hebrews-- The guard smacks him in the mouth. ZED Okay. Lesson learned. No talking.Hey! Why don't you pick on someone your own size? The sergeant drops Oh and turns to Zed. ZED Which would be difficult since there are probably very few people around who actually are your size-- He smacks Zed hard on the side of the head.All right, honestly? You did sell us into slavery.That was way less than a fortnight. Half a fortnight, maybe.Check out that woman across the street! She's looking at us. The prostitute smiles at them as she sensuously peels a banana, then slides the whole thing unbroken into her mouth.This is great! How do I look?So is this it? We just walk around?What kind of trouble?Pretty harsh, isn't it?Did you see that girl? I think she liked me! She looked right at me.Who was she?Why not?Hey, there she is! He starts edging toward the royal pavilion.He makes his way to a position just below the royal pavilion and stares up at the Princess Inanna. She sees him looking at her but pretends not to notice.What's happening?What do they want a virgin for?Seems like a waste of a perfectly good virgin to me.Me? Cool. We're kind of a package deal. Can he come with?I'll try to put in a good word for you. Cain fumes as Zed and Oh head off with Maya.What do you think, ponytail or no ponytail? You know what?Look, first of all, we're not actually brothers---Hey! You didn't let me finish. As soon as I get in there I'm going to talk to somebody and get you invited, okay?Feels like a hair-down kinda scene, don't you think?Maya?! What are you doing here?I was going to rescue you! Really! In fact, we came here to find you.This wasn't my idea, you know.Hey! You're a real girl! That is so cool.Yeah, you look so-- gold. How's it going?Not bad. Had a little rub and a scrub, now I'm up for some grub.Hey! You'll never guess who's here- - Maya! She's working here-- and she looks great! But she's kinda mad at me. Oh scans the great hall looking for her and spots Zed's sister Eema, his crush, come into the room carrying a tray of food.You! Slave girl! (he pulls her away fromNow go-- fetch! Wait by that-- skinny statue. I'll deal with you later. As Eema exits, Zed turns to the officers and shrugs. ZED Slaves-- what are you gonna do?Ouch. Helpful hint. I will keep that in mind.Keep that up and you will.Okay, I know what you're thinking, but I'm just checking it out. We kept hearing that this place was so evil, but now that I look around I'm thinking maybe it's not all bad. There's a lot to learn here.No! Like the wheel, for instance! That's pretty awesome-- the way it just goes around in a circle. And farming! And metal-- writing, money, pottery-- hot baths. Come on! Back in the village we thought sharpening a stick was a big breakthrough.Look, I think I've been chosen to do something great with my life----and I don't think it's hunting wild pigs and weaving baskets. Maya returns for Zed.I hope you don't think I'm interested in her.I'm just using her, Maya! It's part of my plan. I'm going to get you all out of here as soon as I can.It's a secret.And I await her. You two await me. Stay out of trouble. I'll be back. He exits with Maya.I didn't know it was so close.Looks pretty from up here, but some people think God is going to wipe them out because they're so evil.I don't really know you. But you don't look evil.Well, yeah. I think you're-- incredible.No, you're perfect. Your face, your hair-- Your eyes are like the sea.Well, it's kinda dark. I took a shot. I know they're big, though-- and wet-- She pulls him close. ZED Can I ask you one thing? What would a girl like you want with a guy like me?What are we doing here?Yes! Finally. Now you're talking! Should I enter it right here or should we go back to your bedroom? Does the Holy of Holies like to be entered from behind or--?The Gods are in there?Then why am I going in?Right-- right. Then again, if the rules say--What is it with chicks always wanting guys to break the rules? You-all have this bad boy complex---- She kisses him fiercely on the lips.I'm going in. He enters the Holy of Holies. A FIGURE darts between the columns and hides in the shadows. A beam of moonlight reveals the mark of Cain on his forehead.Thank you, O-- Merciful ones, for-- not like-- killing me, and letting me receive the, uh, blessing of your holy-- godliness. He exhales and closes his eyes again, waiting for some divine response. Nothing comes.I was just looking for the bathroom.I wish I was upside down. Looks fun. Oh won't talk to him. ZED So this is it? We're not friends anymore? After all I've done for you?I've helped you come out of your shell.Listen, I know I'm not perfect, and I may have made a few wrong turns, but you have to understand-- I'm a chosen. That's a lot of responsibility -- you can't even imagine.Oh, come on!I just want to say this is really messed up--Can I make a suggestion?Why don't you just pick one person to throw? The crowd thinks that's not a bad idea and murmurs agreement. ZED In fact, don't you think it would be fair for us to get to pick the person who stones us? Cain looks doubtful, but the crowd thinks this is eminently fair.We pick him! Cain points at a BIG GUY, heavily muscled, eagerly waving his hand.No, next to him! He points at a BOY, about nine years old and not very big.So? You got something against kids? Zed plays the crowd which starts booing in disapproval. ZED This guy hates kids!Good thinking, huh? They turn to face the boy, ready to dodge when he throws. The boy winds up and fires a major league fastball that smacks Oh right on the forehead. The crowd cheers. ZED Holy shit! That kid's got an arm!Wait! I have a question for the King! The crowd goes silent. All eyes turn and look up to the palace balcony. ZED Why didn't I die in the Holy of Holies? On the balcony, everyone is totally stopped by his question. One by one they all look to the High Priest who seems to be stumped. In the square, the crowd starts muttering. Zed seizes the initiative. ZED I entered the Holy of Holies and, lo, I did not die! Why? Because I am chosen by the Gods!Yes!Hey! Boys! Long time no see. They glance up, but ignore him. ZED Don't tell me you're still mad about Maya. That's so over. I have a thing going with the princess now-- well, almost had a thing. I'm a slave now-- just like you.Okay. We do have our differences-- like about a cup and half of brain tissue-- but that doesn't mean we can't work together. Another GUARD approaches and whacks Marlak with his stick.You know, I'd like to, but I did something to my neck-- I must've slept on it funny-- those dungeon pillows are like rocks-- well, they are rocks-- so I should probably take it easy or I'll be no damn good for work tomorrow.Okay! But I should tell you, this isn't really my area. I'm just on a break from the mud department-- The Guard draws his short sword and raises it over Zed.Okay, okay. I'm going. (to Marlak andHow high you guys think we're going with this?That's ambitious.Oh, right, the tower. Incredible erection.You're from the village, aren't you? The child nods. ZED I bet you wish you were back there right now, don't you. The child nods again. ZED Well, don't give up. You're going to get home someday. Marlak kicks Zed from behind, knocking him over.I have to get down there.Wow. Who saw that coming? Thanks, Marlak.Lower me down. Without waiting for a response, Zed bravely jumps off the top of the ziggurat holding the rope.He's descending rapidly, rappelling off the side of the ziggurat. He looks up, expecting Marlak to belay him and slow him down.I Said, 'I don't think so.'Whatever that last thing you said was.Let her go.Why don't we just sacrifice something small-- a rabbit maybe. Or a duck. That'd be good, don't you think?I'm the, uh, Chosen One, I guess, and on behalf of, well, the whole city, I want to thank the High Priest for his incredible sacrifice. That was really something, wasn't it? He starts clapping, then Oh starts clapping, and soon all the people in the square are applauding. At that moment a single drop of rain falls and hits Zed in the eye. He looks up, a few more drops, then a hard steady rain starts to fall. The people all look up in awe, then someone cheers and they all roar in celebration. Then the rain stops as suddenly as it started. The cheers die away, and confused, dissatisfied muttering begins. ZED People! Friends! Sodomites! Okay, that was a little confusing, wasn't it?That's what I've been trying to tell you. Zed and Maya, Oh and Eema stand there basking in the gratitude of the people as Inanna looks on.Well said, Marlak. You really have a way with words. They clasp hands.Not much to tell, is there? Just an average guy who saw his destiny and had the courage to defy a powerful empire. No big deal. Oh is at the front of the caravan, giving orders, but no one is listening to him. Zed joins him. ZED Everybody ready?Might head down to Egypt. I hear it's a happening kinda place.Not necessarily. You want to come?Traveling light, huh? Okay, here we go.I knew that. Just wanted to see if you did. Zed grins and they start walking, passing a small herd of sheep and goats, tended by VEILED WOMEN, going in the opposite direction. As THE LAST OF THE SHEPHERD WOMEN passes, we notice something masculine about her build and posture. Zed nods politely to her, but she averts her eyes and turns away from him.", "clean_line": "frustrated hangingorange tangerine umm mango kiwi peach shakes head coyly starts darting tree tree hopefully

didn't hunt today.What's that supposed to be?That's not a bear. That's just some lines on a skin.That's stupid.And what's that? He picks up a skin with another of Zed's drawings on it, this one of a big-breasted naked girl. Zed quickly grabs it and holds it upside down.It looks like Maya.Stay away from my woman.Stay away.Enmebaragesi said he saw you in the garden with Maya.Enmebaragesi doesn't lie. Villagers gather around them, Maya and Eema among them. Marlak puts his spear point to Zed's throat. MARLAK The truth!Your father was a great hunter, but you're like-- a girl. The hunters laugh.Now I kill you. He's about to spear Zed when suddenly the Shaman screams and jumps between them. The villagers step back as the Shaman howls an incantation and shakes his magic rattle at Zed.Now you die. Marlak throws his spear and misses as Zed takes off running into the forest with the hunters right behind him and the whole village ablaze.I see you.Yes, I do.You're trying to trick me.You think I'm going to turn around and look, but I'm not. I'm going to gut you like a pig. He is about to plunge his knife into Zed when suddenly he is struck from behind by a heavy tree branch. He falls heavily, knocked senseless by Oh who is standing over him with the makeshift club. Zed sits up and smiles gratefully at Oh.Get away from my woman!I'll kill you! Marlak starts muscling and squirming his way through the body pile trying to get to Zed.No. You're not just like me.Who's going to take her there? The Chosen One? Marlak kicks gravel and dirt in Zed's face. Zed just lies there and takes it, feeling like he's failed everyone. Then he hears the beating of drums and trumpet fanfares coming from the temple square below.All right. Without a moment's hesitation, Marlak grabs him and tosses him off the top of the ziggurat. He screams all the way down.Now what? Zed looks around quickly, grabs the end of a long coiled rope attached to a big pulley, and hands Marlak the other end.All hail the Chosen One! With that the crowd explodes into rousing cheers.

It's forbidden. Everybody knows that.I think, and I could be wrong, that all the poop makes the ground more fertile, which in turn, gives the leaves in the area a softer feel. It's a vicious circle. Oh notices a very pretty young woman, EEMA, standing near the communal fire with TWO HUNTERS. His heart leaps. OH Hi, Eema! Eema turns, sees it's him and gives him a perfunctory wave, then turns back to the hunters and says something about Oh that makes them laugh.Of course not! She's your sister! It'd be like sleeping with your mother.My hut's a mess. And what if she struggles?Okay, I think somebody's had enough.You make babies--You always get like this when you smoke. Oh takes a big toke on the pipe, chokes, and starts coughing uncontrollably.No.There's nothing on the other side of the mountains. Everybody knows that. The world just ends. You'd fall right off the edge.(tries to cheer him up Will you stop with that crazy talk? We're at a feast. You love feasts. There's women, there's boar meat, there's an assortment of berries-- there's women-- Oh looks over at Eema. Zed picks up on it.You think? They're playing the Jackal Dance. I don't do that one so well.I guess I'm with you.No, the fire. I lost everything.Can we talk about this later? Oh pulls Zed to his feet, and they sneak off into the deep woods.I don't think they'll forget the fire.If it's that huge how would we carry it back?Yeah, we'll make everyone watch us eat a squirrel. Will you get real? There's no going back! There's, nothing to go back to! It's just ashes.What are you doing? Zed makes a minimal gesture with his head. Oh looks up. A COUGAR crouches on a tree limb above them, poised to leap. Oh freezes. They talk like ventriloquists.Will that work?What are you going to do?Yeah, big favor.Yes, you did! You looked right at me-- twice.No, arrows. We're going to need them.Incredible. He takes a step forward, the rock shelf gives way beneath his feet and he falls a great distance, screaming all the way down, bouncing painfully off the big boulders, then a long, tumbling slide over sharp rocks and gravel to the bottom.I see a pattern. Every time something terrible can happen to me, it does.You think? There's about a thousand footprints here.No, thank you.Okay.Okay! Enough! Can we just go? Maybe we can find where they peed. Then Zed sees light through the trees and creeps stealthily to the tree line. Oh creeps up beside him and they peer through the bushes. THREE COWS are grazing in a green pasture. Beyond it, well- tended fields of growing grain. Zed snaps into stalking mode, ducks down and silently signals Oh to be quiet and stay put.He's a hunter. I'm more of a \"maker.\" I made this loincloth, I do arrows-- I made a shelf unit for my hut--Well, it's hard to say-- we justShouldn't we do something?Probably just tuckered out from the fight.Right! You were holding the rock and he-- accidentally ran into it-- really hard-- with his head.Oh, yeah, people could so easily misinterpret that.why don't we go with you?Hey! What about me?That's really good.Do I have to?(trying to change theCan I have one of those? He reaches for a loaf but the MERCHANT strikes his hand with a cane. OH Ow!Are you all right? Did they-- rape you?What an amazing coincidence-- running into you and Maya and them.To get laid?which omnipotent force?I don't know! What's \"omnipotent\" mean?Why would he want that?Why would God choose you? Why wouldn't he choose Marlak? He's stronger.You do have a fat face.They probably don't know how smart you think you are. Finally, a Bedouin SHEIK raises his giraffe-tail fly whisk and waves it at the slave trader.Hold on! I'm coming! Oh tries to maneuver to Zed, but can't move an inch. OH If everyone could just move to the right. Please? Thank you in advance for your cooperation. You can do it, Zed! Use his weight against him! Marlak now has Zed locked in a lethal choke hold.Their hats? I'm sorry, but when that one guy cut the other guy's head off, my first thought wasn't, \"Gee, what a great hat.\"How are we going to rescue anybody? They're killers!Now where do we go? Zed sniffs the air, puts his ear to the ground, and tastes the sand.Why do I listen to you? Now we're going to starve to death or die of thirst.You know, I've asked people about that and no one else seems to remember it.He was a small man. Oh collapses face down in the sand. Pull back to reveal that they are surrounded by hungry jackals, vultures and hyenas.Are they nice?And where exactly are those cities?--of his wealthy bounty. Abraham gets a strange faraway look in his eyes.Couldn't we could just get our ears pierced?You have any idea where we're going?The city! He said God's going to smite them with holy fire!He seemed to know what he was talking about.Gee, they're not open. We should probably come back later.Me? Why do I have to knock? What if we're waking somebody up? Let's just get out of here.Meaner than this? The sentry grabs Oh's nipple and twists. Oh SCREAMS loudly. The guards freeze at the sound of his scream and look nervously to a closed door at one end of the room.Don't have to wait 'til morning.We are so in! She's eye-knowing us like crazy.Well, I kind of have a girlfriend-- not a girlfriend, yet, but a girl I like, so I shouldn't--Sorry.You look good, but I think my hat's too big. They notice an OFFICER staring at them. OH Do you happen to know where I could get a smaller hat? The officer pops him on the head with a truncheon.You can't blame people for being hungry.Gee, I wonder why? The royal guard takes his foot off Zed's neck and they all get back to their feet.Where's everybody going?You throw the virgin in the fire so it'll rain?Can't I go with him?Hah! No? That would be weird.You've been living here since you were nine? I should look into that. How do you get to be a eunuch?I'm not supposed to talk. I'm a statue.How's it going? I just had my whole body painted by a fat guy with no balls, and believe me, he was very thorough, if you know what I mean. How's it going with you?That sounds nice-- for you.There's Eema! Eema has been beautifully groomed and is now dressed as a household slave. She stops to serve some rowdy OFFICERS who take the opportunity to tease and fondle her. She tries to pull away but Sargon, the general, grabs her arm.I haven't joined anything. Does this look like fun? They both look accusingly at Zed.What? Like human sacrifice?Here we go again--I don't know. So much has happened. Sometimes I think-- She walks away. OH I love you.I'd rather not, if you don't mind. I'm not really a slave. I'm a guard.Are those my choices?How's that?That enough?No, really! I'm just-- rubbing oil on this man. She exits.That's so-- unselfish of you.So where does that hall lead to?Wow. So who cleans it?No, of course not. Kind of makes you wonder though-- the guys who built it, did they just die the minute they finished, or did the Gods give them a second to get out?Yeah, that's probably it. So you're saying we can't go in?Seize him! The guards arrest Oh as Cain steps up and takes hold of Zed.What have you done for me? I've been attacked by a cougar, I've fallen down a mountain, I almost had the tip of my thingy cut off, I've been greasing up the High Priest all night, and now I'm hanging upside down in a dungeon. And I have to pee real bad. All because of you. You call yourself a friend? Name one good thing you've done for me.I really have to pee--And his friend! Don't forget his friend! On the balcony, the King and his ministers hastily confer with the High Priest.Okay, you think that actually makes anybody work harder? It just makes them resent you. Is that what you want?Can I just ask when lunch is? The whip lashes out again. Oh glowers at him and steps up the pace.Where're we going?Is that compulsory? Because I saw one when I first got here and it made me a little sick-- The guard's whip catches him across the back. OH Ow! Why don't you try using your words for a change?See the High Priest? I know him. Dear friend of mine.We have to do something! Somebody has to stop it. (turning to the otherHe seizes the opportunity.A sign! It's a sign! The Chosen One comes! The other slaves and people in the crowd pick up his excitement.I know him, too. Oh springs into action, attacking the big guard in front of him. The other slaves see that and start fighting with their guards, a genuine slave revolt.Hello, Eema.Eema, you're my woman! You hear me?Really? It's okay? He pulls her into an embrace and kisses her hard on the mouth. Then, out of the corner of his eye, Oh sees a guard rushing at him. Oh whirls and falls off the platform, accidentally cutting the guards legs out from under him.Then how about this? The High Priest turns to Oh. Oh is holding the big sacramental pitcher. OH More oil?Come back to the village sometime. Zed nods, they shake hands, then they embrace. Stifling a tear, Oh breaks away and whips the lead camel. OH Hee-ya! Come on. People are watching. The camel looks at him and slowly lumbers off. Oh sighs gratefully and signals the caravan to follow. As the great caravan moves off, Zed is left standing there with nothing but a long staff, and a bundle on the ground beside him to which is tied his sword, shield and helmet.

Adam and the others hurry off, and as soon as they're gone, Cain rushes over and starts harnessing the oxen to the cart. CAIN Now listen, I'm getting out of here, and you better come with me. I have a feeling they're going to try and blame this whole \"Abel- killing-thing\" on you.Because when they find him and his head is all bashed in, they're going to start pointing fingers, and you guys are drifters, so they'll put two and two together and that makes-- He stares expectantly at Zed and Oh. CAIN Four! It makes four! Now stop asking so many questions and hop on. We gotta get out of here! He urgently whips the oxen and they climb aboard as the cart lumbers forward.They're gaining on us!

They look confused and doubtful, but relieved.You know, you guys are lucky that sergeant is a friend of mine.

And it's so rare to find a brother that you love. Right? He embraces them.You're gonna love Sodom. Trust me. It's crazy. This morning, I almost got a handie behind that pita stand.Hey, what happens in Sodom, stays in Sodom. He takes a jug of wine from the stall of a WINE MERCHANT. The merchant just bows obsequiously and keeps his mouth shut. CAIN You know, if you guys are staying you should join the guards. The pay's not great, but there's tons of perks. I'm telling you, it's the only way to go. Cain grabs a piece of candy from a SMALL CHILD and stuffs it in his mouth. The child starts crying, Cain kicks her in the ass and she runs away.Come on, I'll introduce you to the captain.Pretty much. We just look for troublemakers and kick the living shit out of 'em.If we see a thief or a pickpocket, we just slap him around-- maybe cut off a finger or an ear, or the tip of his nose, lower lip-- anything you can just grab and slice in one fluid motion-- then we take our share of the loot and let him go. Mostly what we worry about are activist types, rabble rousers, getting people all riled up against the King or the Temple Priests. That's death for sure.Harsh times, brother. We're in the middle of a famine. People are starving. If we don't get some rain soon, it could get ugly. Then we'll get to start kicking ass big time. He stops to flog a BEGGAR with his hand out. CAIN Beat it, you filthy beggar!Yeah, well, just remember, it's the palace that pays you, not the people.The Princess Inanna. She's totally hot, but don't even think about it.Because she's royalty and you're scum? The entire crowd starts moving in the same direction as the royal entourage.To the temple. Let's go. You have to see this.Everybody will be there.It's pretty self-explanatory.Her wish is my command.The three of us are inseparable. We're like brothers. Cain squeezes both their shoulders and gives Maya an artificial smile.Just like Abel. I oughta just bash your head in--For the crimes of blasphemy-- (the crowd grumbles itsShut up! For these and other crimes they may not actually have done yet but we're pretty sure they were thinking about, the prisoners will be stoned to death. The crowd roars as GUARDS stationed around the square pull canvas covers off big baskets of rocks and the people rush to grab stones to throw. Zed and Oh instinctively move closer to each other.Anything to say before the sentence is carried out?Him?He's just a kid!All right! All right! We'll try it. Kid! Grab a rock.

Wouldn't that be fun?Because I'm your brother?Perhaps it's not time for a new High Priest. Aaaahh! He dramatically flings his fingers out at the Prime Minister, as if wielding the power of the Gods. Nothing happens. HIGH PRIEST And let that be a warning to you. Next time, I will hurl a lightning bolt at your face.You there! Golden boy! Rub me with oil. The High Priest dismisses the young men, then stands and lets his rich outer robe fall to the floor. His chest, back and shoulders are incredibly hairy.Then maybe you'd rather I speak to your commander and have you whipped to within an inch of your life. Or perhaps I whip you myself? How would you like that?I'd say so. The High Priest lies back down. Oh looks around, finds a pitcher filled with precious oil and dribbles some on the High Priest's hairy chest.More.No! More oil! Much more, you insolent dolt! Oh pours oil liberally over his chest, back, and shoulders. HIGH PRIEST That's good. Now rub it in.Do it! Oh grimaces and starts gingerly massaging the oil into his hairy chest and shoulders. HIGH PRIEST Mmmmm, I love it. The sweet scent of precious oil. The oily-- oiliness. Eema walks by with a pitcher of wine and sees Oh massaging the High Priest. She gasps.Mnum imam. I have an idea. Why don't we go back to my place and see what's under all that paint?My life is devoted to the service of the Gods and the good of the people. I take nothing for myself. He has a huge gold ring set with precious gems on every finger, and a gold tiara on his head studded with rubies and emeralds.Yes, it is. It's just so-- lonely. Sometimes i hunger for the touch of another human being.Come, I'll show you. He takes Oh's arm and leads him down the hail toward a set of incredibly impressive doors covered with cuneiform writing and arcane religious symbols. HIGH PRIEST Behind those doors is the Holy of Holies-- the earthly domain of theit needs no cleaning.I assume they finished it, then the Gods descended.I just told you! To enter is instant death! Only I can go in and only once a year after very elaborate purification rituals and days of special prayers and offerings.Fine! Enough! I'm sorry I brought it up. Let's go. Move. Move. He shoos him down the hall.I don't-- I suppose it's possible- I'd have to examine some newWe implore the great Gods of heaven to show us a sign that we may honor your divine will and be worthy of your blessing.Yes! Well and truly, the Gods are with us-- The crowd drowns him out.Burn them! Now! He grabs Maya and starts dragging her toward the gaping mouth of the idol and the raging fire within. She struggles but is too drugged to put up much resistance. He grabs the sacramental pitcher of oil and starts sloppily anointing her. HIGH PRIESTWhat did you say?Still not getting it. Zed rolls his eyes in frustration and starts tentatively climbing down from the top of the idol. He jumps the last few feet and lands right in front of the fire, blocking the High Priest's way.Keep away!No! The Gods demand a sacrifice! And you ruined it! He wrestles Maya even closer to the fire.", "clean_line": "el lord heaven earth baal sublime shapash goddess sun hadad storm god ruling son dagon bountiful god grain earthly sustenance come humble supplication invoking blessing sweet rain waters fields enriches harvest fills storehouses makes mighty house ish ka bi baal city sodom king nods graciously high priest feeds children bounty grace accept humble sacrifice power glory magnificence starts inspecting vestal virgins beautiful young women diaphanous transparent white gowns love gods glory creation great dome heaven green growing earth commit maiden holy great cheer crowd throw liver streaked gray favorable sign heart looks good nice red good omen usually means sheep took good care probably sticking high fiber diet grass hay mean surprise visit friend sweetheart going long sea voyage wouldn fun brother time new high priest aaaahh dramatically flings fingers prime minister wielding power gods happens high priest let warning time hurl lightning bolt face golden boy rub oil high priest dismisses young men stands lets rich outer robe fall floor chest shoulders incredibly hairy maybe speak commander whipped inch life whip like high priest lies oh looks finds pitcher filled precious oil dribbles high priest hairy chest oil insolent dolt oh pours oil liberally chest shoulders high priest good rub oh grimaces starts gingerly massaging oil hairy chest shoulders high priest mmmmm love sweet scent precious oil oily oiliness eema walks pitcher wine sees oh massaging high priest gasps mnum imam idea place paint life devoted service gods good people huge gold ring set precious gems finger gold tiara head studded rubies emeralds yes lonely hunger touch human come ll takes oh arm leads hail set incredibly impressive doors covered cuneiform writing arcane religious symbols high priest doors holy holies earthly domain theit needs cleaning assume finished gods descended told enter instant death year elaborate purification rituals days special prayers offerings fine sorry brought let shoos hall suppose possible examine newwe implore great gods heaven sign honor divine worthy blessing yes truly gods crowd drowns burn grabs maya starts dragging gaping mouth idol raging struggles drugged resistance grabs sacramental pitcher oil starts sloppily anointing high priestwhat getting zed rolls eyes frustration starts tentatively climbing idol jumps feet lands right blocking high priest way away gods demand sacrifice ruined wrestles maya closer"}}}
