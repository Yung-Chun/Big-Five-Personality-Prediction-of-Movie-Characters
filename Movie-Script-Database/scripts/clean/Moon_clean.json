{"Moon": {"GERTY": {"raw_line": "Morning, Sam. How are you today?I'm very well. How's your headache?Sam, is everything okay?You don't seem like yourself today.Has something happened?Sam, what is it?Sam, it might help to talk about it.Tess isn't responding to things?What kind of things?Im sure she can't wait, Sam.Perhaps Tess didn't receive the message?I think her brother did get the position at the University. His name is Christopher, correct?Yes, I seem to recall he got the position. Professor of Biochemistry, I think. At Syracuse University in New York?You told me. Some time ago now. Towards the beginning of your time on Selene. When we were starting to get to know each other. You were very happy for your brother-in-law. You danced around the Rec Room, if I remember correctly.No Sam. From what I understand it's fairly low on the companies priority list with the Jupiter mission active. I would imagine it would be very expensive to fix.Sam, are you ok?I will Sam. Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?Of course. Now?Baby back ribs with french fries and spinach.Sam, can I ask how it happened?You saw something on the TV?Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you, but when I came in the TV wasn't on.Perhaps you were imagining things?Morning, Sam. How are you today?How's the hand?Sam, you're in the Infirmary. You had an accident.Do you remember what happened?Do you remember me?That's good. That's very good. It's nice to see you awake again. I'd like to keep you under observation here in the Infirmary for a few days and run some tests.Not long. Sam, go back to sleep. You're still very tired. We can talk later.These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know --Sam, you're out of bed.Not talking. No. We've been having some problems with the lunar sat and our live feed seems to be down. I was recording a video message for Central updating them on your progress. Sam, you need to stay in bed. You're not ready to walk around yet.Excellent, Sam.Sam, you suffered minor brain damage in the crash. This has resulted in memory loss and slight logic impairment.Central has asked me to slow down the Harvesters to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back --The good news is you can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow. But it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.He must have stalled.I'm sorry Sam.Sam, I am under strict orders not to let you outside.What happened?There is no damage to the exterior shell.Sam, I'm not supposed to let you go outside.Okay, Sam.We need to get him to the Infirmary.Sam, we need to get him to the Infirmary immediately.Hello Sam. How are you feeling?The Infirmary. You had an accident out by one of the harvesters. Do you remember?Who did you see, Sam?You saw a girl out by the harvester? How is that possible?Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries, but all in all the prognosis is good. I'm happy to see you again.Yes, Sam?Yes.Sam, get some sleep. You're very tired.Sam, you're out of bed.Sam Bell.You are Sam Bell.Sam, what is it? It might help to talk about it.We could run some tests. I haven't reported anything to central, Sam. They don't know you were recovered alive from the accident.I'm here to keep you safe, Sam. I want to help you. Are you hungry?Yes, Sam.Hello Sam.Sam, is everything okay?938 hours.Approximately.What is it about Sam that scares you?I know.You have changed, Sam.Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.Sam, when you first arrived at Selene, there was a small crash. You woke up in the infirmary. You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss. I kept you under observation and ran some tests.Sam, there was no crash. You were being awakened. It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests to establish mental stability and general physical health. Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA can have considerable impact--They are memory implants, Sam. I'm very sorry.Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal. Can I prepare you something?Sam, can I help you with something?Helping you is what I do.Of course, Sam, how can I help?I don't know of a hidden room.The lower deck is out of bounds to awakened clones --I understand the situation is unprecedented.A clone is awake the moment his pod is opened. But he is not fully conscious for several hours.I am not permitted to do that, Sam.Yes.That is the last thing I want.The new clone will be conscious within one hour.Sam? Where is Sam?Sam, this is not going to work.If the Rescue Unit examine my memory banks they will discover what has taken place over the last week. As you know I record everything. If they are suspicious, the first thing they will do is search my memory banks, and this would put you in considerable danger.I recommend erasing my memory banks. I can reboot myself once you have departed.I'll require your assistance, Sam.Okay, Sam.I understand, Sam. I hope life is everything you remember it to be.Of course. The new Sam and I will be back to our programming as soon as I have finished rebooting.Sam, you're in the Infirmary. You had an accident.Do you remember what happened?", "clean_line": "morning sam today headache sam okay like today happened sam sam help talk tess isn responding things kind things im sure wait sam tess receive message think brother position university christopher correct yes recall got position professor biochemistry think syracuse university new york told time ago beginning time selene starting know happy brother law danced rec room remember correctly sam understand fairly low companies priority list jupiter mission active imagine expensive fix sam ok sam want finish cutting hair later course baby ribs french fries spinach sam ask happened saw tv sam said tv distracted came tv wasn imagining things morning sam today hand sam infirmary accident remember happened remember good good nice awake like observation infirmary days run tests long sam sleep tired talk later extraordinary circumstances know sam bed talking ve having problems lunar sat live feed recording video message central updating progress sam need stay bed ready walk excellent sam sam suffered minor brain damage crash resulted memory loss slight logic impairment central asked slow harvesters ensure time recuperate strength good news return sleeping quarters tomorrow days resume like normal work schedule stalled sorry sam sam strict orders let outside happened damage exterior shell sam supposed let outside okay sam need infirmary sam need infirmary immediately hello sam feeling infirmary accident harvesters remember sam saw girl harvester possible sam suffered slight concussion crash incurred minor injuries prognosis good happy yes sam yes sam sleep tired sam bed sam bell sam bell sam help talk run tests haven reported central sam know recovered alive accident safe sam want help hungry yes sam hello sam sam okay hours approximately sam scares know changed sam sam account occurs base sam account occurs base sam arrived selene small crash woke infirmary suffered minor brain damage memory loss kept observation ran tests sam crash awakened standard procedure new clones given tests establish mental stability general physical health genetic abnormalities minor duplication errors dna considerable impact memory implants sam sorry sam hours meal prepare sam help helping course sam help know hidden room lower deck bounds awakened clones understand situation unprecedented clone awake moment pod opened fully conscious hours permitted sam yes thing want new clone conscious hour sam sam sam going work rescue unit examine memory banks discover taken place week know record suspicious thing search memory banks considerable danger recommend erasing memory banks reboot departed ll require assistance sam okay sam understand sam hope life remember course new sam programming soon finished rebooting sam infirmary accident remember happened"}}}
