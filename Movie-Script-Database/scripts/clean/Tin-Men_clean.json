{"Tin-Men": {"BB": {"raw_line": "Who?Who's the beauty?I thought maybe you saw some chick walking by. I lost my concentration. Why do they call cars 'she'? They never say 'he'... always 'she.' The Salesman shrugs his shoulders. BB walks around the Cadillac.Very nice... very nice.Now don't try to hustle me here ... you know what I mean. I hate being hustled. Give me an honest price, not one of your 'special' deals... give me an honest price. Do I make myself clear?There ya go... there ya go... you're doing it... you're doing one of those hustle numbers.Four dollars... I want to pay four dollars a month.What do ya want to hear? That I'd love to pay three hundred and fifty a month... is that what you want to hear? Tell me how much you want me to pay and I'll tell you how much I'll pay, but don't do a hustle on me... I don't like that. How much do I want to pay? I'd like to pay nothing! CUT TO:And I get a loaner if the car's got to stay?I get a loaner? The Salesman nods. CUT TO:Are you a lunatic? Can't you see I'm trying to back out of this lot? There's a red light, you shoulda stopped.Bolted! At six miles an hour I'm bolting into the street! You schmuck! You schmuck! He moves toward Tilley.Back away? You want me to back away? I'll back away. He turns to walk away from Tilley, walks and then turns back and kicks in the headlight of Tilley's car.You're a madman! Smashes into me, attacks me... the man is crazy! People continue to pull them apart. MAN #1 Come on now, calm down, calm down. He holds BB's arms. Another MAN grabs for Tilley and tries to pull him off BB. MAN #2 Take it easy... take it easy...You're going to prison. Death! Death! They're going to give you death!Car only has one sixteenth of a mile, and I've been hit. He turns back and looks at Tilley.I'm gonna get even with you, you son of a bitch... I'm gonna get even with you. This is no ordinary traffic accident.Stay with him.He's bluffing.Ballsy move. Moe throws his hand in, too.Yeah. It's already been hit.Didn't have it five minutes, backing out of the place, and a guy comes out of nowhere and bangs into my car.I bet it's six hundred bucks.I didn't dent the frame.He didn't hit the frame! I'll tell you this, I'm gonna get the son of a bitch. If he would have apologized or something, but this guy gets out, tries to push me around.Yeah... the guy's totally off the wall. He takes a sip of his coffee.I'm gonna get him... just for the fun of it. CUT TO:No, I'm up to here with the coffee. He indicates his throat.I don't know. You know what would be fun to do..? Let's try the Life Magazine routine.You know, I think we've got to come over about two feet. The SCREEN SHAKES as BB moves the camera. CUT TO:I think this is a better position... the light is hitting it, which is accentuating the effect we're going for. It's very good... very good.She's at the window.This is going to be terrific in Life Magazine. Terrific in Life Magazine! Come on outside, honey.Bingo! The Housewife approaches BB and Moe suspiciously.Move the tripod another foot... another foot. Moe moves the tripod.Two minutes, ma'am, and we'll be out of here. We just need the picture for Life Magazine, and we'll be out of here.It's very simple. Ya know, we're doing this layout about the benefits of aluminum siding -- a 'before' and 'after' kind of presentation.A wonderful issue... it's one of the finest pictorial things we've done here at Life... the ways you can improve your house. We're gonna be out of here in no time, ma'am.No, no... we've got a house that looked like yours and it's been done in aluminum... it's very nice.What? The aluminum siding? Oh... I don't know the figures offhand. Do you have any idea, Moe?You mean have your house as the 'after' and find another house that looks like your house for the 'before'?What do ya think, Moe? Would that be ethical?You'd have to work out an arrangement with an aluminum siding company and they'd have to do the job very quickly for us to make our deadline... we've got a deadline, that's the problem.Pressing it. Do you think we could manage it, Moe?We might be able to work it.Moe, did you call the office and make sure we can hold up the issue until this job is completed? This house really could be a showcase.Not me. I don't want to go where they've got snakes.I've heard they've got snakes that'll outrun a horse through the grass. They got a snake that bites you... you got eleven seconds to live. No thank you. I don't want to spend my good money to visit with that kind of jeopardy. I'd like to go to a place where... hold it! He hits the brakes suddenly.The guy who ran into me... that's his car. He puts the car into park and opens the car door.I'll be back, Moe. I'm gonna even the score. He gets out of the car, quickly walks over to Tilley's Cadillac, and with a swift kick, he kicks the headlight that isn't already broken. CUT TO:You want to get in good with these people... you want to win their confidence? Good thing to try... get a five dollar bill, take it out when the guy's not looking, drop it on the ground. Guy looks back, pick it up, hand it to him and say, 'Mr. Blah blah, you musta dropped this five dollar bill on the ground.' Two things happen... he says, 'It's not mine,' you say, 'Musta been, 'cos it's certainly not mine,' or the guy takes it. Right away this guy is thinking you must be one hell of a nice guy... you're in. You start chipping away... you start getting inside those people. Stanley is quite taken by their information. BB puts his cup down and grabs his coat.Come on, Moe, let's split.This guy's looking to play tit for tat. That's not my game. I'm gonna play hardball. BB throws the glass down on the ground.I'm gonna find out everything about this son of a bitch, and then I'm gonna find the one thing that cuts him to the quick.Are these any good do ya know? These TV dinners?My wife died.I'm over it now, but it was a very trying time... very trying... I've only just started eating again.But then you have to sit and watch it cook. Something seems sad about a man sitting alone in a house and watching a chicken cook.Here's to Nora. Moe smiles, picks up his can, they tap their cans, and both take a swig of their beers.See that one, if you were married to that one two weeks you'd have to put your head out of the window for air... this one smothers. That one is the kind that can't live without you... ... 'Where were you? When will you be home?'Christ! It's not even one o'clock yet. How long you been married now? What is it? Twelve... twelve years?Holy God! Sixteen years? What do you think? Is it worth it?Why do you think?Quite a recommendation... can't wait to do it. He laughs.Look how much more complicated things are now. There used to be a time you met a girl, you courted and then you got married and lived happily ever after. Now, see that one over there... ... that's Helen Armstrong... maiden name used to be Tudor. Get this, she dated Charlie Rider when I was in high school, seemed like they were together forever. They broke up, she started to go with Lenny Mardigian, they got married, she's Helen Mardigian. That goes on two years... three years, something like that.They divorce, dates Billy Small for a couple of years, lives with John Isaacs for a year, marries Tommy Selnini... that marriage goes in the toilet, but fast. Now she's dating Charlie Rider who was divorced by Evelyn Chartoff who used to be Evelyn Gage before that. So much for relationships.I don't believe it! Mr. Banana Head is here.That crazy guy that banged into my car and smashed my windows in. I don't fucking believe it! I'm gonna get him.You got a lot of nerve banging into my car, and you've got a lot of fucking nerve smashing my windows in.You didn't smash my windows in?You didn't break my windows?! You didn't break my windows?! He pushes Tilley.Come on, let's go outside... let's settle this in the parking lot.What is this? What is this crowd here? We're charging admission?We'll see who's the lucky one. He picks up his coat and leaves with Moe. CUT TO:Well, I guess that's to be expected. You want me to take you home?Every time I listen to Sinatra, I always remember when I used to work in Atlantic City back in the late 40's... you know, a busboy job... Sinatra used to play at the 500 Club, and we used to take our dates and say, 'Hey, you wanna go and hear Sinatra?' Then we'd just lean on the door of the club in the alley and listen to the music. I think the girls were looking for something a bit more uptown. Nora laughs.I sure do. CUT TO:Hey, asshole... here's the ultimate 'fuck you'... I just poked your wife! CUT TO:She's in my bed right now with a big smile on her face. CUT TO:Is this a setup? That son of a bitch... I bet he set me up... I thought I got him, and he got me. That son of a bitch! CUT TO:Sure. CUT TO:It's the future, Moe... it's the future.I dunno... looks like any tin man gets in that hot seat, then he's had it.Boy, I tell ya, I bet you could sell a ton of these things.Ever see a dealership?Interesting. They get in the car and drive off. CUT TO:I tell you something, she's getting on my nerves.Yeah, yeah... who else is it gonna be... 'who, Nora\"!... who else is there? The whole idea of being with a girl on consecutive nights is new to me. It's one thing when they're with you for a night, but when they live with ya, it's stretching the point. They got a lot of things they bring with them... you go to the bathroom you see 'things' you never saw before.Well, they move your stuff around and it's not where it used to be... I'm not used to that.What?! Did we just meet? How long we been partners? No, I've never lived with a girl!Yes, I did. I came in last night, she was sleeping on my side of the bed. In my life I never got out of bed on the left side... in my life, never from the left. I got close once up in the Catskills. I met this girl, Dorian. For a week we were together, but it wasn't the same because she always went to her room to change and do all that stuff. She didn't have things in my room.All this 'cos I'm trying to get even with some guy. You know what? I think I got to see her and put an end to this. CUT TO:Yeah. CUT TO:Listen, I got a problem.Um... er... Well, the problem is... like... is like... eh, you know... you're the problem.There's things that are bothering me.You know... things.You know, like things that come up... stuff... like... you know, annoyances.Hard to explain... very hard.As an example... I came home last night, I get undressed, and I realize you're sleeping on my side of the bed. I've always slept on that side... it's something I've always done.I didn't want to wake you up... I thought you might think it was kind of stupid or something.But there are other things... bigger things. But I realize just talking about it, they all sound petty and silly.I don't think we've got to take drastic action. Nora smiles.Thought I'd come by and get things off my chest... talk it out. Listen, I'm going over to Pimlico... catch the seventh race... wanna come?I know. He goes to walk away, then turns back and gives her a quick kiss. He turns and walks away. Nora watches him as he walks by the rows and rows of secretaries and clerks. CUT TO:Way to go... Southern Belle. Moe tears up his ticket.Should have bet with me, Moe. CUT TO:Did you bother to bet, or did you just hand your money to the tellers?Who's your accountant, mister, 'cos I think you're down in the debit side.You want me to believe that you were setting me up with your wife as some kind of decoy?Okay then, you win. BB gets into his car.If getting Nora is part of losing, Thank God I didn't win. CUT TO:It's a good location... get a lot of traffic on this street. CUT TO:I finally got hold of May... she was over your sister's.She'll be down here shortly.Just take it easy, Moe... rest.Don't worry about it now.Don't worry... don't worry. I'll take care of it tomorrow.They'll sign, Moe. Don't worry, they'll sign.This is kind of new to me, but I thought I better call and tell you I'm gonna be late... maybe two or three. I never had anyone there to call before, but I thought I should call, you know.I dunno... I thought I'd better call, that's all.I don't know what's gonna happen to Moe.Yeah. He hangs up the phone and walks to a room opposite. He opens the door and stands in the doorway looking at Moe who is lying beneath an oxygen tent. CUT TO:I don't know. To be honest with you, I think I'd rather work alone ... he's too green. Is he a pain in the ass?So what good is he?If this is a sales pitch, I think you got to work a little harder 'cos I don't think you've got good product. CUT TO:What are you, crazy?! Nora drives the car forward and then backwards again almost running BB down. She rolls down the window so that she can yell.Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Nora starts to move the car towards him. He moves away, and her car smashes into the side of his car. She presses the button to the window and rolls it down just a shade.No, it's his wife.Not tonight, Ruthie, my dancing shoes are on holiday.I'm more than sure. Ruthie moves off. BB takes a shot of whiskey and downs it, and then drinks some beer.Best I ever saw? Best tin man I ever saw? He holds up his shot glass towards the bartender, and the bartender fills it up.Harry Apel... Dandy Flynn... those guys had good lines, but they burned themselves out too fast. Best? Moe's the best... the best there ever was. If he's in the door, he's got a sale. The best closer ever.God damn Nora... God damn Nora! I'm trying to adjust... I'm putting up with things I never put up with in my life. I mean, give me a break... give me a break, woman. Stanely wants to get back to the topic of best tin man.It was getting to be real pleasant ... figure that. More than pleasant. To hell with her!Great man, Moe. Great man. BB holds out his glass again to the bartender who refills it. BB downs the shot and drinks more beer.I don't know why they're so irrational... chicks. I dunno. I think it's because air gets inside 'em. She probably went back home, to her husband. Eleven-thirty... he wouldn't be home yet. This outght to cover it, Stanley. He puts the $10 bill down on the bar and walks out of the club. CUT TO:He ain't here. He gets out of the car and looks around the street some more. He stumbles up to a couple of parked cars, look- ing for Nora's car. He falls into some trash cans in front of the house. CUT TO:Hel... Before he can finish the word \"Hello,\" Tilley hits him hard in the head with the butt of the gun. BB falls to the ground unconscious. CUT TO:What're you doing?You're the craziest human being on the face of this earth! Tilley, getting ready with another egg.Nobody does this to me and lives! Nobody!You're going to rue the day you ran into my car. This ain't the end... this is just the beginning. Tilley throws another egg. CUT TO:I can't believe it, the man throws eggs at me and now I'm gonna have breakfast with him.I tell you what... I'll drop the charges against you, and we can wipe the slate clean.I told you, I wasn't breaking into your house. I was looking for your wife.Why don't you just order some scrambled eggs and be done with it... all right?I'm getting a little hungry... I've got a headache as it is. Just order some eggs so some other people can have something to eat before the lunch trade comes in.This is not a four-star restaurant ... we're not having a gourmet meal... we're ordering breakfast, for Christ sake!Can I have some French toast and a cup of coffee? Bagel, what do you want?French toast and a cup of coffee.I'm back to pressing charges against you! Tilley turns and is face-to-face with BB.All right, you want to finish it now? You want to finish it right now? I'm ready... I'm ready now!I can't stand it any longer. You're driving me out of my mind. BB lunges for Tilley across the table, Sam and Bagel try to intervene -- the Waitress doesn't know what to do.We're gonna finish it... we're gonna finish it.So, I'm having French toast and coffee. Bagel? CUT TO:Moe, when you decided to marry May, how did you know?How did ya know?Yeah. How did ya know?This Nora is a pain in the ass, Moe... a pain in the ass. It's worse now than when she used to be around. Moe smiles.You wanna hear something? The other night at the Corral Club, I turned down a dance.What's the odds on that? You think you can come up with odds on that one?Lot of good times, Moe.That's it, Moe? You're gonna spend the day measuring people's feet? 'You're an \"E\" fit... you're a \"D\" wide... you got a high arch... I'll show you something in an alligator... something with a wing tip...' How can you talk about that all day long? Moe, you're the best tin man there ever was. Nobody's a better closer.So, May's happy about this Hess Shoe thing, heh?Nora Tilley, please. We hear a WOMAN'S VOICE on the other end of the phone.She's with Social Security.I dunno... she's there somewhere ... yeah, on the third floor... she's got a desk towards the back.Nora, this is BB. The PHONE goes DEAD. BB reluctantly puts the receiver down. CUT TO:I gotta talk to you.Give me a chance to explain. You owe me that much. Nora still walking toward her car in the downpour.It was a lousy thing to do, okay? It was a lousy thing to use you to get back at your husband... but the fact is that I never would have met you otherwise. Nora stops and turns to look at BB.It was lousy... it was a disgusting, terrible thing... but a lot of good came out of it.I'm not always a nice guy, I admit that. I got a lot of training in deceit... it's an occupational hazard. They stand looking at one another in the rain.I didn't want to have to come here. I wish that I didn't have to ever see you again. I've gone this far in my life without having to have this kind of thing happen to me. I was going through life, sailing along, pretty good... doing okay, and I tried to get even with some crazy guy... and I'm here.I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of this, but if this stuff's got to happen, I guess I've got no choice. I wanna... ya know... ... I wanna be with ya! Okay, I said that... I said it, okay?! I wanna be with ya! It pisses the hell out of me, and I'm gonna tell you that to your face, but I want to be with you because... I miss you and I'd like to live with you... I'd like to marry you... and that's that! Nora eyes him carefully. The rain falls on her umbrella and the rain beats on BB's head. After a long moment.You're gonna come back and stay the night?I'm glad this is working out.Yeah.Honey, for me... I'm a parade. CUT TO:Okay, Stanley. Stanley closes the car door and BB drives off. Stanley watches BB's car turn the bend, and then he goes toward the office door. CUT TO:You know something, Stanley, I can always smell a guy who's not made of tin. He walks over to Stanley.It's against the law to steal files. I could call and have you arrested and sent to jail, right now.You work for the Commission, is that it? Stan nods \"yes.\"Doesn't the Commission have enough information? They got to send out guys like you to spy?You know what your big problem is, Stanley? You're lazy. If you want to find out stuff, then you dig... you get on the phone... you canvas... 'We're from the Home Improvement Commission...' Go find your leads... that's what we do all the time. You're just lazy, Stanley. If we're doing something wrong, you should collect all your evidence. Instead, you snoop around... steal files. What is this? Undercover time? You think you're breaking up some big drug ring? Is this the Mafia you've infiltrated? All you've got here is a bunch of guys selling tin for Christ sake! You want some files? He walks over to the filing cabinet, flips through some files and pulls out three files. Stanley has gotten up from the floor. BB throws the files down on the desk.Here... here's some jobs I did. Leave Moe out of this... he quit the business. Stanley gathers up the files from the desk.Go on, get out of here. Stanley starts for the door, and turns back.If it's not gonna be you, it's gonna be somebody else... and if it's not tonight, it's gonna be another time. Stanley exits the office. BB picks up the files that Stanley had taken out of the filing cabinet, and starts to put them back. Then he slams the filing drawers closed very hard. CUT TO:You don't need to talk to him.Ever see a Volkswagen?You know, those little Volkswagens.It's a car... a little car.I dunno... they're interesting.It's interesting.I dunno. It's a little thing... you know, a little thing. Guy tells me they don't even have radiators... they're air-cooled.It's interesting... different... something new. I like it. CUT TO:Can I talk to you in private, or do I have to talk to you over fourteen pool tables? Tilley moves down the hall toward BB.We've got enough that's going down between the two of us, but the fact of the matter is that I love your wife, and I want to marry her.Why don't we just talk about this in a nice, rational manner.We've got our problems, but let's try and isolate this particular situation.What are you gonna gain from this thing here?Nobody's going to benefit from making me mad.What you're saying is you don't want to discuss this, am I right?I enjoy the game.Rack 'em. HARD CUT TO:Combination... side pocket. The tin men react. BB hits the ball and sinks it.That's four.You make this one here, and you win.Bad break. BB quickly goes to work... sinks every one of his balls. He eyes the eight ball carefully. Tilley's nervous. A couple of the tin men make private side bets whether the ball goes or doesn't. BB lines up the shot; he shoots, and it misses, hanging up on the lip of the pocket.Yeah... that puts an end to one of our differences. Now, concerning you...I'm gonna beat the crap out of you. You want it here or do you want it outside?I think our business is finished. Tilley just stands watching BB. BB walks up the steps of the pool hall and exits. CUT TO:LOONEY Yeah... yeah. Essex.Yeah. I just got some business downtown I gotta take care of. He stands there watching Nora as she prepares the plates of food.Listen, Nora. I... um... I... er ... lied to you the other day. Nora is still waiting for the toast, looking inside the toaster to see if it's getting brown.I went to see Tilley about the divorce. She turns to look at him.He was not too agreeable, and one thing led to another, and we decided to shoot some pool to settle the matter.We played pool. If I won he'd give you up, if I lost I'd give you up.Nora, I had no choice.Nora, I had no choice! Hand me the toast.I'm just trying to be honest. It's been on my mind... on my conscience. He picks up a plate.This plate yours or mine?Tilley is not the most rational man in this world. I tried to talk to him... he wouldn't listen. So, what are my options? You know what I'm saying? What are my options?All right, I'm sorry. Beat.I lost. He dips more toast into his eggs and eats.I blew the eight ball.Yeah.It means I'm supposed to give you up, and I'm never supposed to see you again.Well, I'm supposed to give you up as part of honoring that agreement, but I'm not that honorable a guy. He smiles, takes a quick sip of his coffee.I gotta go.I told you, I got some business downtown. He gives her a kiss. Starts to go, turns back, gives her another kiss, more passionate this time.I'll see you later. He goes down the hall to walk out the front door.You?You got a lawyer?I don't need one. I don't expect to win.I gave them some pretty incriminating evidence.The only way I could think to get out of this business. He smiles.She's doin' all right. A MAN comes out of the hearing room.I do not wish. CUT TO:Sorry about your license.Yeah. They got my license as well.What are you doing standing there?Stolen?You need a ride uptown?Come on. They cross the street and go toward BB's Cadillac. BB gets in the driver's side, Tilley gets in the passenger side, and the car pulls out. CUT TO:I don't know what the world's coming to.You know what our big crime is? We're nickel and dime guys. We're small time hustlers. They got us because we're hustling nickels and dimes.Gotta find a new business to get into.Maybe... maybe not.Believe me, we'll find something. It's just a matter of time.You know, I hear the new Cadillac's gonna be out in a couple of months.Yeah... they're changing the body. I hear it's a beaut.What're you talking about?

{"raw_line": "You're a sick man! Sick! Do ya hear me?! Do ya hear me?!Who do ya think I'm screaming at? How many of you are there up there? There's only you, and you're a sick human being.It's like yelling through a wall to you. I'm carrying on about what a disgusting human being you are, and all you want to know is where your white on white shirt is.You're being unreasonable. You don't even want to listen.Look at you, quarter to three and home already. What happened? You and the fellas run out of things to talk about?What's a five letter word for a Portuguese overseas province?M-A-C-A-O... that fits.We're off tomorrow. Beat.What are you talking about... this match box?You're not selling anything?It happens.Well, you will. You always do.What are you talking about? The monthly payments on your Cadillac are more than this whole house. Why don't you get yourself something cheaper, like a Chevy?I'll turn out the lights. Nora gets up and puts the cups in the sink -- gives a big sigh. CUT TO:You know, Tilley, we hardly ever do things together.Do things together that are enjoyable.If we went on a picnic... it would be fun.Yes... it's nice to do that.I think there's something nice about a picnic... it's fun.I just thought it might be nice to do something together, that's all... thought it might be fun.It's not the same thing.I don't think they're too good for you, not a lot of 'em anyway. She continues to choose her frozen foods. BB continues talking to her.Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.You know what would be a lot more healthy and satisfying is to get yourself a chicken... just pop it in the oven for a couple of hours with a little bit of seasoning on it. Makes a good meal, and you can make sandwiches with the leftovers.I love ya, Ada, and if you're smart you won't come back. The cake is being passed out, and people are talking -- it has become somewhat of a party atmosphere. Nora turns to her friend, NELLIE.I've just decided... I'm going out with him.I have to. I just want to know what it's like to be with someone else. She sips her Coke.Because if what I've got with Tilley is as good as it gets, I just... ... I gotta know.Tilley doesn't get home until at least two in the morning.Everything I've done in my life has been safe and practical, and where's that gotten me? Well, here's to who knows what. They touch their cups. CUT TO:I'm still nervous.No, not right now.I'd go with you and lean against the door. They dance for a bit and look at one another. He leans toward her, holds her tight and kisses her. Then the RECORD STICKS on the words \"that's the time\"... \"that's the time\"... \"that's the time\"... BB slips off one of his loafers, while still embracing Nora, kicks it so that it hits the side of the record table. The RECORD SLIPS a little and continues to play correctly.You've got a pretty good aim.Oh, my God! She just stands there and tears run down her face.He must have gone crazy... I don't know what happened to him... he must have found out I was with you... I don't know... I don't know what to do. She starts to cry. She goes to hug BB.Can I stay with you for a day or two? BB puts his arms around Nora.Yes. Bill! BB turns towards Nora. Nora waves to him, happily, with a twinkle in her eye. BB feels conspicuous -- people are looking at him. He gives a little wave.I'm glad you stopped by. This is a real surprise.Oh. How can I help?Really. How so?Like what?Things?Annoyances?Well, try.Then why didn't you just nudge me a bit and tell me to go and sleep on the other side?Well, that's easily changed.Listen, if you think all of this is going too fast, maybe I should move out. Is that what you want, Bill? BB looks around, very uncomfortable, and he shrugs.I really care for you, but if you think it's best. I don't want to make you unhappy. After a long beat.I can't get away from work.Why? Do you think you have some obligation?Well, I'm glad you did.Well, I hope he's okay. I'll see you when you get in. She gives BB a kiss on the phone.You don't have to tell me. How many nights did you drop me off and come up here all the time?Well you know, I think we really should get divorced.Yeah, I'll have some.Yes, it went wrong somewhere along the line -- I don't know where though.Yeah, I like him.I'm glad you feel that way.What?This was that guy?He didn't tell me he was a tin man... he told me he sold baby pictures.Oh, God! Not another tin man. CUT TO:You're a goddamn tin man! Then she backs the car up. BB tries to go around the front of the car.You wanted to win me just to get even with my husband... screw you! She rolls up the window, floors the car, and drives away.Mrs. Tilley.I don't want to see you anymore. She pulls away from BB and continues walking. BB walks behind her, getting soaked in the rain.I don't want to listen.I don't owe you anything. BB lets her walk away. After a beat, he yells out.What kind of a person would come up with such a devious thing?I'd like to know what it is about me that I have to fall for tin men. What kind of character flaw do I have?The wet becomes you. Gets rid of some of the slickness.I was hoping for something a little more romantic... but, okay. A slight smile comes to BB's face. CUT TO:I dunno... all my things are back at Nellie's -- the other side of town. I know what I could do, I'll go back to the house... there's still a few things I left behind ... at least I can get a change of clothes. They both sit down. BB looks at Nora.You really happy?You don't really show a great deal of exuberance.What happened?They're taking the furniture?What do you expect? You expect to get some preferential treatment ... you're some special case? You've got to pay your taxes just like everybody else has to pay their taxes! Tilley shrugs.How many arguments did we used to have about filing your taxes?There's a responsibility that you've got to have. It's a long way from high school, Tilley.Where are you gonna sleep?There's just a couple of things you didn't throw out of the house ... a couple of things I didn't find in the drawer.Listen, about the divorce. Do you want to file, or should I file?He told me all about it... all about how you threw eggs at him.He was trying to find me. We had an argument.It's not for you to make decisions for me.I know what I'm doing.I appreciate your concern, but it's not for you...You're a good one to give advice... you're sitting on the steps, locked out of your house because you can't pay your taxes, and you're going to give me advice on life?My benefit! You don't give a damn about me! You don't give a damn who I marry. The reason you don't want me to marry is because he's the one taking your wife, and you've got your own problems with him.You don't care about me... it's the same bullshit you're doing. That's what it always is with you, Tilley. It's always you! The I.R.S. took your house... your furniture! You don't say anything about my things in the house. I've got things in the house I worked damn hard for, and things that belonged to my family... the headboard that was given to me by Aunt Josephine, it's got to be at least a hundred years old... and the hand-embroidered footstool...The hand-embroidered footstool over by the TV.It's been there forever... it was my granny's.You've never seen it!? You've never seen it!? You put your feet on it to watch TV... the hand-embroidered footstool.That's the way you are, Tilley, it doesn't mean anything to you. You don't care if they take it all away. It's all you, Tilley! That's the way it's always been.Maybe if I talked to him another day he'll change his mind. I mean, he's like that... one day, he's this way and another day he's that way.I mean, he's probably, you know, upset about the I.R.S. taking the house and all our stuff. After a beat.What?What does that mean?What does that have to do with anything?What?What's so interesting about a car?Yeah?Bill! Better hurry up, everything's ready.I can't believe that you're up so early. This is a rare occasion.Toast will be ready in a second. Coffee's on the table. He continues to stand watching her -- she's not aware that he's watching her. She waits for the toast to pop up out of the toaster.How so?What?!You played pool for me?It's the most despicable thing I've ever heard in my life. I mean, it's disgusting... guys shooting pool to determine my future.Get the toast yourself. BB takes the toast out of the toaster.Why don't you take both... maybe you can choke to death on one of them. BB takes one of the plates and goes toward the table. Nora watches him a beat, amazed that he doesn't seem to recognize the seriousness of the situation.How can you be so... how can you not understand how wrong that is? I can't understand that mentality! Shoot pool for me! It's insane. BB dips his toast into his eggs.I can't believe you had to shoot pool! Don't you understand that ... don't you understand how crazy that is? You're sitting there... you're eating your eggs as if it's normal business in life here! Like feudal lords or something you used to read about in history books.What happened?You lost?You lost?What does that mean?Will you stop eating the eggs for a minute! How can you tell me things like this and casually eat your eggs?! What does this mean, Bill?Why are you running off so fast here?", "clean_line": "sick man sick ya hear ya hear ya think screaming sick human like yelling wall carrying disgusting human want know white white shirt unreasonable want listen look quarter home happened fellas run things talk letter word portuguese overseas province fits tomorrow beat talking match box selling happens talking monthly payments cadillac house cheaper like chevy ll turn lights nora gets puts cups sink gives big sigh cut know tilley hardly things things enjoyable went picnic fun yes nice think nice picnic fun thought nice thought fun thing think good lot em continues choose frozen foods bb continues talking oh sorry hear know lot healthy satisfying chicken pop oven couple hours little bit seasoning makes good meal sandwiches leftovers love ya ada smart won come cake passed people talking somewhat party atmosphere nora turns friend nellie ve decided going want know like sips coke ve got tilley good gets gotta know tilley home morning ve life safe practical gotten knows touch cups cut nervous right lean door dance bit look leans holds tight kisses record sticks words time time time bb slips loafers embracing nora kicks hits record table record slips little continues play correctly ve got pretty good aim oh god stands tears run face gone crazy know happened know know starts goes hug bb stay day bb puts arms nora yes bb turns nora nora waves happily twinkle eye bb feels conspicuous people looking gives little wave glad stopped real surprise oh help like things annoyances try nudge bit tell sleep easily changed listen think going fast maybe want bb looks uncomfortable shrugs care think best want unhappy long beat away work think obligation glad hope okay ll gives bb kiss phone tell nights drop come time know think divorced yeah ll yes went wrong line know yeah like glad feel way guy tell tin man told sold baby pictures oh god tin man cut goddamn tin man backs car bb tries car wanted win husband screw rolls window floors car drives away mrs tilley want anymore pulls away bb continues walking bb walks getting soaked rain want listen owe bb lets walk away beat yells kind person come devious thing like know fall tin men kind character flaw wet gets rid slickness hoping little romantic okay slight smile comes bb face cut dunno things nellie town know ll house things left change clothes sit bb looks nora happy great deal exuberance happened taking furniture expect expect preferential treatment special case ve got pay taxes like everybody pay taxes tilley shrugs arguments filing taxes responsibility ve got long way high school tilley gonna sleep couple things throw house couple things drawer listen divorce want file file told threw eggs trying argument decisions know appreciate concern good advice sitting steps locked house pay taxes going advice life benefit damn damn marry reason want marry taking wife ve got problems care bullshit tilley took house furniture things house ve got things house worked damn hard things belonged family headboard given aunt josephine got years old hand embroidered footstool hand embroidered footstool tv forever granny ve seen ve seen feet watch tv hand embroidered footstool way tilley mean care away tilley way maybe talked day ll change mind mean like day way day way mean probably know upset taking house stuff beat mean interesting car yeah better hurry ready believe early rare occasion toast ready second coffee table continues stand watching aware watching waits toast pop toaster played pool despicable thing ve heard life mean disgusting guys shooting pool determine future toast bb takes toast toaster maybe choke death bb takes plates goes table nora watches beat amazed recognize seriousness situation understand wrong understand mentality shoot pool insane bb dips toast eggs believe shoot pool understand understand crazy sitting eating eggs normal business life like feudal lords read history books happened lost lost mean stop eating eggs minute tell things like casually eat eggs mean running fast"}, "TILLEY": {"raw_line": "Who's sick?Where's my white on white shirt? The nice one, you know.Yes, the one with the permanent stays. CUT TO:I don't know what I did... I got no idea. If it's my fault, I'm sorry... I'm sorry. I can do no better than that. A full unconditional apology. Tilley walks down the steps of the house and goes to his car -- a Cadillac. He gets inside, STARTS the ENGINE and pulls away. Nora remains on the porch watching the car ... one lonely figure in a neighborhood of hundreds of duplicate houses. CUT TO:She's gonna drive me to my grave... I'm headed to my grave... the woman's driving me insane... it's not supposed to happen this way. He starts moving his head -- stretching his neck from right to left.It's not even eleven o'clock and my neck is stiffening up. He juts his jaw out.My neck's tight... it's tight. CUT TO:Me? What are you, crazy? You just want to back into the middle of the street like that. A man's just driving along and you back into the middle of the street. What kind of driving is that? What kind of driving?You came out of nowhere... you bolted out of no place... bolted out of nowhere.Back away from me, do ya hear me? Back away from me.You're a fucking lunatic! He goes for BB, jumps him and they both fall on to the trunk of BB's car. People have started to gather and immediately jump in and pull BB and Tilley apart.Get this guy! Will ya get this guy? Backs in front of me, and then kicks my headlight in... and I'm crazy. You lunatic! Tilley makes another jump for BB. Again, people try pulling them apart.You want to drive a Cadillac, learn how to drive. You want to get even with somebody? You picked the wrong person to get even with. Nobody backs into traffic, smashes my car and says they want to get even. I'm gonna get even! CUT TO:Florence, eggs and the toast, the way I like it. FLORENCE, who doesn't have too much energy, calls back to Tilley.Come on, give me a couple of more inches.Come on, Sam, I'm having a terrible morning. You're not going to believe this, some guy just crashed into me... right in the middle of the street... then he attacks me. One of the loonies.Yeah, I got his name. The police came... God, I can't believe it... the guy's an idiot. He pulls a piece of paper from his pocket.Yeah, here it is... some Polish name... Babowski... Bill Babowski ... fucking son of a bitch.He sells aluminum siding? I don't believe it... of all the people that could run into me, it has to be a fucking tin man. How come I don't know him?I don't know the guy.I don't know the guy.I don't know the guy!What do you want me to do, date him? What do I give a shit if he's a good dancer?Is it fresh?Just asking, Florence.I'll tell you one thing, when I get a hold of this guy, I'll break both his legs and then he won't dance the Marengay too good. CUT TO:We haven't even got to discussing terms. There are so many friendly financial arrangements that would hardly be a bite into your weekly salary.Well, as I said, you can always reach me... you've got my card, and when the time comes, let's talk. The Husband and wife stand to show Tilley to the door.Hey, give my best to your little son... wonderful kid there. What's his name again, Ronnie?Randy, right. Well, good night. CUT TO:I thought I had 'em... I was this close. He demonstrates with his fingers.Damn! I thought I had 'em. Tilley STARTS the CAR and pulls out. CUT TO:Nothing again... came up short. Let me get a little advance... three hundred, just to carry me for a bit.No problem... just in a little slump here.What do you mean, walking? You think I'm gonna work somewhere else... you've been very good to me... very honorable.Wing, I need a bit more than that... I got expenses.Yeah, but how much is she gonna make working at the Social Security office? Wing writes out a check and gives it to Tilley.Come on, Wing, can't you do better than this... a man in my position in terms of this firm... I dunno...Which scams are they talking about? They got a list?They take your license? CUT TO:Give me eight points I take the Knicks over the Lakers for 20.It's that fucking lunatic again. He races out of the door of the hotel towards BB's car which pulls away and speeds down the street. Several of the tin men run after Tilley. He stands in the street watching the car disappear.Can you believe this guy? Is he sane or what?I don't know the guy!I'll tell you something, if Mr. Marengay wants to play... we'll play. CUT TO:Please! I'm out there working myself to the bone, trying to make a living. He goes over to the refrigerator and gets himself some orange juice.Try Macao.What're you doing up so late?I think this place may be a little too large for us.It's got a lot of overhead to it. What do you do... spend your time in the bedroom and the kitchen, that's all. So why do you need a living room and a dining room. He walks over to the back door and looks out.Why do ya need a back yard?I'm in a slump.Last year I'm number three top seller... year before, right up there. I can't get my momentum going this year.I'm not sure I like the idea of all this overhead breathing down my neck. When you have a place like this, that's a lot of overhead.It doesn't instill confidence in my clients. Cadillac means that you're dealing with someone of importance. I thought I had a couple tonight... they just slipped away... slipped away. I'm gonna take a bath -- my neck's been tight since this morning.Like what?What would we do together for it to be enjoyable?I don't understand a picnic... we just go some place... we put a thing on the ground, and we eat.Why? I don't get it. It's better sitting at home and watching TV.What's fun about it? Ants get into the food... there's bees. I don't get it. We have to drive, it takes maybe an hour to get there, then you sit in grass and eat. Why is that fun?It doesn't sound like fun to me... you take the stuff you've got here in the house, you take it someplace to eat it. It's just as much fun eating in front of the TV, and we do that together, don't we? No ants and no bees... much more comfortable.Scrub my back, will ya, Nora. Nora picks up the back brush, puts soap on it and starts scrubbing Tilley's back.Not too hard! Don't get me wrong, I'm willing to do anything with you. I'm just a little stymied by a picnic. If you want to go, send me a postcard. Nora drops the brush in the tub and walks out of the bathroom.What did I say?Okay, Mr. Marengay... here I come. He reaches into the backseat of the car and takes out a crowbar.I'll show the son of a bitch. He gets out of the car, crosses to BB's Cadillac, and smashes in the windshield and all of the windows of the car.He'll get a lot of air... won't be too stuffy in this car when I'm finished.Damn it! Damn it! I can't believe it... I can't believe I did that.You think I can't add? He goes to rack to re-set. Mouse goes over and puts a nickel in the juke box. A RECORD slips into position, and Harry Belafonte's \"Banana Boat Song\" begins. Mouse, in unison with the record, sings, and is totally caught up in the song.From the IRS. I never even remember seeing it. I must have left it with my other bills. I wonder what it is?Hum... says here that they haven't received my 1962 taxes. They seem to be saying that they didn't get my check for four thousand dollars.I can't believe they spend all that time and energy to write to me... to single me out.I probably forgot... people forget their taxes all the time... just slipped my mind... I got so many things on my mind.I figured they could wait a few years... it's not like they need my money to build a bomber. You think they're waiting for my money before they dig a new road? Are they all sitting there saying, 'Well, it's time we went to see that guy on Pimlico Road... can't run this government without his four thousand dollars.' I figured they'd give me a little leeway. I'm going to pay them... I know I've got a debt... I just need a little leeway.You think I'm gonna let some schmuck know all my business... have some guy pull me over the coals for spending on this and that. I need some privacy.I can just see that schmuck in that little tax shop telling people my business... how much I make... how much I spend... no way!Just what I need in my life right now... I'm in a slump and I've got the IRS on me. Like when something goes wrong, it's like... He throws his arms up in the air in exasperation. CUT TO:Well, what can I say... I'm a modest person... I just do what I can to help.We got 'em! He's very excited.Take a look at this, Sam. Tilley shows him the written contract. Written across the front of the contract in big, bold, black letters are the words: \"THIS JOB IS FREE.\" Sam looks at Tilley.This is the best scam I've ever thought of in my whole life. He kisses his hands with wild smacking sounds. He's ecstatic.It's in my blood... I'm brilliant ... I'm fucking brilliant... this is such a brilliant scam... I'm beside myself.Here it is... you go back in the house and this is what you say... CUT TO:Fantastic, Sam! A twenty-seven hundred sale! 'This job is free'! What a beaut! I'm out of the slump! Tilley's riding high again ... Tilley's back! We ought to go and celebrate. Let's go to the Corral and have a drink... we can turn the paperwork in a little later.Gil keeps saying it... I've never seen him. I'm riding high... twenty-seven hundred dollars... 'this job is free'... the man went insane... lost control of himself... his wife and children are out on the street! Sometimes I'm brilliant... I'm fucking brilliant... I can't believe it. CUT TO:Scotch straight up?Scotch straight up and a rum and Coke for me. He looks around the room at the women.Looks like there's good action here tonight.You were never one of those atheists, were you?So, what did you do? Have some kind of religious experience?You found God at the smorgasbord?Sam, people have religious experiences like on a lake or when they go up into the mountains, that kind of thing.Sam, you're too much.Yeah, yeah... I get the point. So?Yeah.I'm not getting the same religious effect that came over you. I don't know why, but I don't feel like running to a church to pray right this second.Yeah, yeah... I don't believe it. See the guy over there? He looks in the direction of BB.That's the son of a bitch who crsahed into my car. Sam looks over to BB.What're you talking about? Why would I want to break your windows?I'm a hard-working guy... I don't go around breaking windows. I've got better things to do.Push me one more time and I'm gonna have to redefine your face. BB pushes him. Tilley starts to go for BB and they scuffle about. Moe and Sam try to pull the guys apart.Oh, no! You're not gonna get near my car... you're not gonna kick in my headlights again... ... What am I talking about? I didn't even drive tonight. You wanna duke it? Let's go. They both head out the door. The other tin men follow, and others who have been paying attention to this alter- cation, also follow. CUT TO:Back away... give me some elbow room.You're a lucky man... the police showed.Yeah, this is Tilley... CUT TO:What are you talking about? CUT TO:Well, that's just fine by me... she's a pain in the ass... an albatross around my neck. You're welcome to her... keep her... and may you both rot in hell! Tilley slams the phone down. CUT TO:I'm a free man! I'm a free man! He grabs Nora's shoes and throws them out onto the street. Then he goes into the bathroom and piles all of her toiletries in his arms, tosses them into a trash can. Takes a suitcase from a shelf in the bedroom, opens it, throws in the trash can. He clears out her underwear drawers and empties them into the suitcase, closes the suitcase and then throws that out of the window. He's out of breath, exhausted and sweating. He goes down- stairs into the kitchen to get himself a drink. He sees a pair of Nora's slippers under the kitchen table, he picks them up, opens the back door and tosses them outside. Locks the door. He stands there as if a motor is running inside of him. Walks out of the kitchen.Wing, give me a minute to get a cup of coffee here. Tilley passes Sam on the way to the coffee machine. Sam is looking through the sports page of the newspaper, along with Mouse and Gil.Four in the fourth... twenty bucks.I don't know... it just came to me -- number four in the fourth.'Rider's Revenge'... I like that name. I've gotta go and see Wing. Look, we can be scientific from now to doomsday, but we gotta be gutsy and go for the big one. Tilley goes through the door into Wing's office.Ah! Ah! He jumps back, and puts his coffee down on a desk, and wipes his hand on the back of his jacket.What's up, Wing?What do ya mean? They wouldn't clear the loan?What's wrong with this world? There are sick people out there! Thievin' son of a bitch like that takes up my time... cuts into the amount of hours I have available to deal with other people interested in my wares! There's no fucking sympathy for the working man in this country.Wing, it was such a beautiful thing... you shoulda seen how I worked. Like a magician... 'this job is free'! It was my best... my best! There's no fucking justice in this world... there ain't no justice. Tilley goes to pick up his coffee off the desk.What section?'Home Improvement Commission... Hearings begin today...\" Is this McCarthyism? What are they gonna see? If there are any communists?I keep racking my brain. I gotta find a way to really get even with this guy. It isn't enough to wreck his car... even breaking into his house and messing it up or something, that don't have enough impact. I mean, the man poked my wife! I gotta come up with something ingenious... something ingenious. Sam sees a WAITER approaching and indicates to Tilley to get off the subject. Waiter arrives at their table.I think I'll take some meatloaf.No, I think I'll have some fish. No, no... fish doesn't fill you up. Meatloaf. He closes the menu.What number is Sally's Pride?Six... six... six... six. I'm thinking one. Whose one?Then that's it, I'm going with one.Sam, I'm not doing too well by checking the stats, so why not. I put my hand to my forehead, I see a one -- Mr. Motor in the second... twenty bucks. They both look toward the track, the horses race to the finish line. Number nine streaks across the finish line.I got it... I got it... He picks up the racing form.Three to one... hundred and sixty smackers. Hand to the forehead! Hand to the forehead!Third race, I see a six... I see a three. I don't think the verdict's in on that one yet. Tilley stands up and is going through his money and race tickets.Wing paid a hundred on number five, he loses, I got hundred and forty... next race I'll lay down the bet. What you taking in this race?You take Thrifty's Delight -- 20 bucks, I got 20 on Mr. Motor, Wing's got a hundred on Night Fire. What's the odds on Night Fire?I don't see Night Fire winning. Fuck it, I'm not gonna even place the bet... I just made a hundred bucks.He's not gonna win... I feel it.Hey, Wing, we're sitting just off the left of the entrance. I'm gonna lay down your bet right now. See you in a minute. You lost the first race, in case you don't know. CUT TO:We're taking a thirty-to-one shot... number eight... come on number eight... 'Streamers...' come on, you sucker! CUT TO:Thirty-to-one... a hundred bucks on you, number eight. There's a guy up here who put a hundred on ya. Come on... come on... come on, baby... come on, baby!Nooooooo!That was your horse, Wing?Of course. Wing goes to look at form.Eight hundred?Fordnee lane -- eight hundred. Sam is looking at Tilley knowing that he's really in a jam.Eight hundred.Er... hum... er... hey, Wing... I tell you, I got a problem.It's the eight hundred on Fordnee Lane. I haven't got it.I haven't got the winnings.Wing, it was the craziest thing... I didn't want to mention it earlier because it was so nuts... it was the craziest thing.I don't know how to even tell you this without being embarrassed for myself. It was an accident... it's like one of those things out of the blue... it's crazy... you can't explain it... it happens.It happens... I don't know how... I don't know how to explain. It's too crazy, I swear to God, Wing.You won, Wing... you won, it's just that you're not getting any money... it was a fluke. I swear, I don't know how it could have happened. A ten-year-old couldn't have made the mistake I made... I don't know, I swear.If there was some way I could make it up, believe me, I would, because you know where I stand. There's a beat while Wing just looks at Tilley.You know where I stand, Wing. If there was any way, believe me, I'd make it up. I'd give you thirty percent of what you didn't get because it was a fluke... I'm willing to make some kind of retribution.No. I'd split fifty-fifty with you, that's how badly I feel under the circumstances.Am I trying to shirk my responsibility? That's not the way I see it... it was a fluke, a crazy thing that happened, but I stand behind my honor on this... put it on my tab.What do you mean, wrong? It was a fluke... it was an accident. I don't know what the hell went wrong. It was a one-in-a-million thing that happened to me when I went to place that bet. I'm trying to do what I can.Fuck him! It's on my tab. At least I've got six hundred in my pocket right now. It's like another loan. Sam, you got to think about today. Today, I got six hundred bucks in my pocket. You know what I'm saying?It's like some guy trying to sell me life insurance. You think I'm gonna take some money out of my pocket to give to some jerk so that somebody can take it when I'm dead? No, Sam, you gotta live for today. I'm gonna live as good as I can every day. You know what I'm saying? As Sam and Tilley walk towards Tilley's Cadillac, BB and Moe are walking to BB's Cadillac parked close to Tilley's car. They see each other.Hey, Mr. Marengay went to the track!The sarcasm's killing me. I thought you were looking to get even.Who's stuck with my wife. You or me? He laughs.Decoy is the word! There's a long beat as the two guys eye one another. Then, almost in a soft apologetic manner, BB speaks.I win? That guy would never let me win. He must be setting me up. The son of a bitch is setting me up, Sam.I couldn't have won. I smell a rat. BB's car pulls away. Tilley and Sam watch him go. CUT TO:No way! I didn't eat anything, so why should I pay for Mouse... he eats like an animal.No way! He's a pig! He always eats more than anyone else. Why should I pay for his food?Like an animal! Like an animal!What did he have? Sam, what did he have?Well I don't remember what he had. Gil, what did he have?Then what did you have?What is this, a quiz show? We don't know what you had. What did you have?Very little!! You eat like an animal! It couldn't have been very little.He said he didn't have pancakes.I don't give a shit.French toast? He had more than French toast.I don't give a damn... it's split five ways.Was not long ago you never would have seen a woman in here.I know. I was just trying to be congenial... you know, start a conversation off, on a nice kind of light level, you know. So, what's the scoop, Nora?Makes sense. You want some more coffee?Florence, some coffee here. It's for the best. You know, we were kind of fooling ourselves, weren't we?Yes, something went wrong... I don't know. Florence walks over and pours coffee for Tilley and Nora, then walks away.So you like this guy?All in all I guess it'll all work out for the best.Yeah, can you figure it out? A guy bangs into my car, thinks I did him in, tries to get even with me by stealing my wife, you two people fall in love... can you figure that out?You telling me you didn't know this was the guy?Yeah, I told you I ran into another tin man.It's your life. All I know is this guy has a bent weather vane.Why can't they get rid of that fucking record? It's not a hit anymore... nobody cares about this song anymore... it's history. Mouse continue singing in the background.He's getting on my nerves. The guy eats like an animal, and sings like an asshole.Yes, sir... yes, sir!IRS? They're not gonna leave me alone!We've got to appear?Can't we just ignore it? How do they know we got the letter.What do you think, Sam?Why is this happening? Am I paranoid or something? I mean, why is this happening? The government is after me... the state is after me... Mr. Marengay ... somebody is always after me. What the hell's going on here? I'm just this guy. What's the big deal? They can't get along without me? The government can't operate unless they've got Tilley's money... the Commission's after my job! This shit's driving me insane! All the lying, thieving, stealing corporations in this world, and the IRS takes the time to come for me? There's billions of dollars out there but they've got to come and get Tilley's four thousand dollars! Turn off the fucking Belafonte song now, or I'm gonna break the goddamn machine!!They got no right. You know what I'm saying, Sam? They've got no right. Tilley takes a drink from a pint of whisky he has open.Where's my car? What happened to my car?Yeah, it's better. CUT TO:I knew I could smell a rat! The son of a bitch is coming for me... the son of a bitch never wants to leave me alone! Tilley walks over to the night table, opens the drawer and pulls out a revolver. CUT TO:You want to rob my God damn house? I'm gonna make it easy for you. Come and rob Tilley... come on... take everything he's got. CUT TO:You're a sick man! You smash my car, you steal my wife, and now you come to rob me! You're one demented human being. BB tries to focus on Tilley.I'm going to call the police and send you to jail... but I'm going to humiliate you first. Tilley throws an egg at BB and hits him in the head. BB is groggy and confused and still drunk.What do ya want to break into my house for? This ain't the fucking Rockefeller mansion! There ain't thirty-eight television sets here.They ain't saying 'Nelson, I think we've had a break-in... count the sets to see how many we've got left.' There ain't tons of jewelry hanging out of drawers... it ain't like I don't know which watch to put on, I got so many. I'm a working man, trying to make an honest living. What fucking morality you got, asshole?!! Tilley throws another egg at BB and hits him in the head again. Egg yolk drips down BB's face. He tries to get off the floor, but can't.What else do you want from me? Huh? What else?! I've got enough problems with the I.R.S. busting my balls and the Home Improvement Commission bullshit to contend with. I don't need aggravation from you.How do ya like your eggs? Over easy? Side of tomatoes? He throws a tomato.A guy breaks into my house and I'm being charged with assault? It makes no sense...I was defending myself... he was stealing from me.I wanted to humiliate the guy. Here I am, out busting my ass all day making a decent living, I come home, and some schmuck is trying to steal from me.If I had some soup I would have thrown soup at him... is there any law you can't throw eggs?What did I do? Invite him in so that I could throw eggs at him?He's lucky that he didn't rob me last week, 'cos then my wife was living at home and we had all kinds of things in the fridge... I could have thrown barley soup, pumpkin pie, candied yams... yeah, he got off light. CUT TO:What am I supposed to say to him? The man has been a pain in the ass since the day he rammed into my car.I appreciate it.But I don't understand how the slate gets wiped clean when he breaks into my house and I'm the one charged.All right... all right... I'm too tired... the slate's clean... the slate's clean. The WAITRESS approaches.Couple of eggs over, some hash browns, some toast -- toasted dark... butter on the side, large grapefruit juice and some coffee. The Waitress writes his order.On second thought, instead of the eggs over, if I ordered soft boiled eggs do you take them out of the shell or leave them in the shells? We can see that BB is getting a little irritable.I don't like them that way because they get hot in the hand and it's hard to scoop the stuff out... it's not good... and you get little bits of shell in there and it doesn't taste good.If I'm going to order, at least I ought to be content with my food.Why do I need a guy telling me what I should or shouldn't eat?It so happens I haven't been to this restaurant before. I don't know how they do their eggs... if they're over easy and they're gooey, I'm not happy with it... and I'm not happy if the soft boiled eggs are left in the shell...Hey! I'm ordering here. At least you can have the courtesy to let a man order his breakfast.Sam, this guy gets on my nerves... from day one! I knew it then and I know it now. Tilley stands up from the table and starts to leave.You want to play that way? This game ain't over, mister... it ain't over...You're ready?! You're ready, that's what you're saying?! You're ready now?! I have to be intimidated... I have to be brought here to be intimidated...Get the people with the straitjackets... this man is out of control. Tilley and BB pull at one another.I'm not finished with him, Sam. You heard me... I'm not finished with you, mister.Sam, I can't concentrate on 'Bonanza' shit...I've got too much on my brain, what with that asshole and the Home Improvement Commission, I don't want to have to worry about whether Little Joe got laid last night. Let's go and eat something.God, if you're responsible for all the stuff down here, maybe you got a moment's attention for me. Between the I.R.S., this Home Improvement Commission and Mr. Marengay, I got it up to here with this bullshit. To be frank with you, I'm in the toilet here. If you can see your way...Listen, I'm praying here... go around.It's out of order... go around. He signals for her to walk around him. The Woman looks at him and moves down the line.Do what you can, all right? I appreciate it. Amen. Tilley helps himself to some salad. CUT TO:What's the name again?Doesn't ring a bell. Sam, does it ring a bell to you?That's an awful lot for nothing. Doesn't sound like good business to me.Maybe I'm missing the point here, but if he paid twenty-four hundred, which is the cost of the job, I can't see anything wrong with that. I don't know the guy, but I don't quite get the problem.What's he talking about? The man got the job for twenty-four hundred dollars, and that's what it costs in aluminum siding.Um... I don't know... we have no recollection of this particular job, but I don't know if this is deception. Look, if you work in a clothing store, some guy tries on a suit, it looks like shit, but you tell him it looks wonderful. The guy's standing there looking like a sack of shit, the salesman says what a great suit and the man buys it. That's deception as far as I can see, but I don't understand the deceptiveness that you say we're responsible for... if I make myself clear.Did somebody put a gun to this guy's head and make him spend twenty-four hundred dollars? I don't get the point here. I don't know the specifics of this case, not being privy to all the information, but all I can say is this guy got a fair price for a fair job. Another commissioner, BUD DELANEY, takes the microphone.I think you'd have to familiarize me.It sounds right.We wanted to be a little more generous, that's all.But should a referral turn up in the community, we'd be more than happy to give them twenty dollars instead of the hundred and fifty.Glad we could be of some service. Tilley and Sam get up from the table and walk out of the building. CUT TO:We beat 'em, Sam... we beat 'em! What a piece of cake! No problem! They ain't got nothing on us... clean as a whistle... we're clean as a whistle!Yeah, must be about that.I'm just getting used to ya, Sam.It's a slump... it's a slump, Sam.You're not serious about this, are you, Sam?You're serious? You wanna get another partner? You don't think I'm gonna pull out of this?So?I know... I know. Change in the lineup. Okay, maybe it'll help... maybe it'll help. You got any ideas for a new partner?Mouse! Mouse! He gets on my nerves... He eats too much. Here's to some pretty good times, huh? Sam smiles.The I.R.S... they need my furniture. They got some living room somewhere in this country that needs to be furnished.The furniture, the whole house. They locked it up... they confiscated it.We had a lot of arguments. Nora starts toward him. Tilley sits on the steps.I was doing pretty good there for a while... doing pretty good. Had my house, had a wife, a Cadillac... I still got my Cadillac.I'll stay at Sam's for a couple of days until I get set up. What're you doing here, anyway?I don't know... I did a pretty good house cleaning number on you.I got to be frank with you, this guy is nuts.He told you it was about eggs? The guy tried to break into my house. He tried to steal things from me.I think you'd be making a big mistake if you married him.I think maybe I should, because I think you're being misled... I think you're confused. I think...Nora, listen to me. I know about guys...But this guy is as bad a choice as you could make. Bad choice.I'm not giving you a divorce, and that's it. I'm looking out for your welfare. No divorce. Nora looks at him, starts to say something, then stands up and walks down the steps of the house toward her car.It's for your own benefit, and you'll thank me for it. Nora turns toward Tilley and suddenly snaps.What footstool?I don't remember seeing that.It's been there forever? I've never seen it.I don't know what you're talking about. I never put my feet up to watch TV.Hand-embroidered footstool? He walks over to his car, gets in and STARTS the ENGINE... shaking his head in disbelief. CUT TO:Tilley and Mouse. It looks weird, doesn't it? Looks very weird.I don't care who she marries, but I don't want her marrying you!Rational? You're going to be rational?Isolate... isolate... I like this kind of talk. What the hell nonsense is that?Now let me see here... I've got to isolate that for a moment and think it over.You ought to hear yourself. You know that? You ought to listen to the way you talk. You come in here, you want to take my wife ... you want to isolate this situation... you want to be rational. I've got no tolerance for you, mister. You know what I'm saying?You like pool? The other tin men move closer to Tilley and BB, crowding in.Why don't we play a little game of eight ball? If I lose, I consent to the divorce... if you lose, you give Nora up... walk away from her. BB stares at Tilley; Tilley eyes BB.Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Tilley keeps moving around the table, sinking one ball after the other. He's enthusiastic, excited and confi- dent. He sinks another ball, and another. He sinks every ball, then he eyes the eight ball for the coup de grace.Don't I know it... don't I know it! He shoots. The eight ball heads for the pocket and doesn't make it. It hangs up on the felt about two feet from the pocket.Tough break. Tilley quickly moves and sinks the eight ball.You lose.Yeah?Outside. BB turns his back on Tilley to move toward the door. Tilley swings with all his might and hits BB in the back of the head. BB almost falls to the ground. Tilley goes to hit him again. BB hits him in the face, knocking him back. Tilley falls back... BB starts to move toward him. The tin men move in.Stay out of this... this is between the two of us. BB gets to his feet... the two guys eye one another, moving. BB quickly moves with incredible cat-like speed with four hits into the stomach, really fast, and one hit to Tilley's head. Tilley falls into the rack of pool cues, they all fall to the ground. BB goes to jump on Tilley. He slips on one of the pool cues and falls to the ground.Hey, Wing, isn't that the putz from the Commission? Points to car driving out of parking lot.What the hell's he doing hanging around here?I nailed his ass the other day, Wing. Can't lay a finger on me. I was amazing, you should have been there. I was amazing... I was respectful, courteous, but I was slipping and sliding... they couldn't touch me.You're gonna sell me out to the Commission? Wing, am I hearing this right?Is this about the money I owe you? Are you just pissed? You want to get even because of the horse race? I told ya it was an accident.You're selling me out? You're gonna let them bury me? Jesus Christ, Wing... Jesus Christ! I'm not gonna be able to work in this business? Wing, this was my chosen field!Jesus Christ!You'd sell me out for a lousy three thousand dollars? Three thousand dollars and I got to go down the toilet? Jesus Christ, Wing, how long the two of us been busting our asses together ... Jesus Christ! We got some history to this relationship for Christ sake. Masters puts a little squeeze on you, you just sell out. Three thousand dollars?!You gotta testify, huh?Yeah.Nah. I already testified once. I beat 'em before, I'll beat 'em again. You got a high-priced mouthpiece to speak for ya?How so?You gave them evidence?Hey, that's good... that's good, yeah. There's activity in the hallway.So... how's Nora?Yeah... here. Take good care of her. CUT TO:I'm not aware of the section numbers. Sometimes you get a little overzealous in the heat of the sales pitch, that's all. BB is watching the proceedings. CAMERA HOLDS ON him.As I remember, no sale was made concerning those customers.It was temporary insanity. I don't know... it just came over me ... it might have been something I ate. I don't know... it was crazy, I'm the first to admit it was a crazy thing to do. Believe me...What are all these numbers here? I'm not familiar with all these section violations.Are you sure? Maybe the guys want to think this over.gets up from the table and goes to the back of the room to exit the building. He stops at a desk just inside the door where the clerk is sitting. Tilley pulls out his wallet, takes out a small document, and throws it down on the desk. He exits the building. CUT TO:Yeah. What about it?Who took it?Tax man! Fucking I.R.S. How low can you get? How low can you get? He walks around in the space as if somehow his car might reappear. He mumbles to himself.They're lowlife. How can people come and take a man's car?... His Cadillac? CUT TO:Yeah. You in there?Sorry to hear it.This is where my car used to be.I.R.S. Fucking bandits! Bandits! Thieving sons of bitches! BB looks at Tilley for a beat.I could use one.Some bullshit commission, huh? Tell me, where's it written it the Constitution that says you can't hustle for money? Where's it written? It ain't like I went into an alley and hit a guy over the head with a brick and stole his money... not like I broke into somebody's house and stole his stuff. All I'm doing is selling... where's the crime in that?You're telling me. I don't know what the world's coming to.Nickels and dimes. You got a good point there, BB. You're right on the money with that kind of thinking. BB stops the car at a stop sign. Something catches BB's eye. THROUGH the windshield we see a Volkswagen \"beetle\" going from right to left.New? Very hard to find something new to get into. BB puts his foot on the gas and starts to drive.Better put on my thinking cap... not easy to think of something new. CUT TO:Yeah... matter of time. Beat.You're kidding?Maybe I should put in my order now.Give me the pot... I'll fill it.

'Bonanza' last night? Can you tell me why Ben Cartwright had a colored guy stay over?No... he was just passing through, asked if he could stay over, and Ben Cartwright said 'sure thing.' It doesn't make any sense... he invites a strange colored guy in... invited him in to stay. Is that crazy or what? If a colored guy came to my door and said 'can I stay the night,' I'd tell him 'get the fuck out of here'! It's nothing personal, mind you.Me? No, I'm not a bigot.It's the fact the Ben Cartwright's on the Ponderosa... he's in the middle of nowhere. It's not like he's living on Reisterstown Road with houses all around... we're talking about the West here. It's the idea that a strange guy comes to the door in the middle of the West. It doesn't make sense, that's all I'm saying.Listen, I'll sell tin to anybody ... I don't care who he is. A mark's a mark, whether he's Chinese, Indian or from Mars... I'm thoroughly integrated. Makes no difference to me... I just wouldn't have one of those guys sleep in my house. CUT TO:I just don't believe that 'Bonanza' is an accurate description of the West. I say no more. Tilley slips into the booth next to Sam. He indicates for Sam to give him more room.You want me to take my plate... I'll eat in the parking lot.Did ya live?Gil, he doesn't know the guy.He seems to be indicating that he doesn't know him.You're not a girl and you're impressed! Florence comes over and puts down some coffee in front of Tilley.The amount of time you spent there, I thought you were ready to send for me to close it up.He's always said that about you, Wing. Always said that about you... he has.And some scotch, straight up. Tilley pockets the check.Did she hear me say scotch straight up?They have no respect for the working man.Jesus! What a pain in the ass. Do you think this commission's gonna stick around or is it gone with the wind?What's he got, a gnat up his ass? What the hell's wrong with the guy?Jesus Christ! We can hear the \"BANANA BOAT SONG\" through the door, with MOUSE SCREECHING along with it. Sam takes the letter and goes through the door to the pool hall.Tilley. He nods for Tilley to go over to him. They start to walk together through the darkened areas of the Pool Hall.Found this on your desk while I was going over some papers. He hands the letter to Tilley.Maybe it's a refund check. Tilley opens the envelope and looks at the document.What? It must be a clerical error.What are you talking about? You didn't pay your taxes?You can't mess around with the government. Why don't you go to H & R Block, they'll take care of your taxes for you.Taxes is serious stuff, Tilley.All I can say, is you better get a lawyer or somebody to look into this, 'cos the IRS, they don't fuck around.So, what's the scoop?You're kidding?Are you fucking crazy? You just gave them forty-two hundred dollars in aluminum siding free?!What are you talking about?Mr. Tilley is crazy... he had a nervous breakdown. WIDEN to include Man and Wife from before.He's been under a lot of pressure recently... he snapped... he had a nervous breakdown... it's the saddest thing I've ever seen. Let's be honest about it, nobody gives away forty-two hundred dollars' worth of aluminum siding free.Let me tell you something, when I go and see his boss and show him this contract, he's out of this business... he'll lose his home ... his wife and kids will be thrown out onto the street. He'll probably spend some time in an institution, so God knows what will happen to his wife and kids. Anyway, it's not your problem.You don't expect his boss to pick up the forty-two hundred job, do ya?Yeah, it's a bad state of affairs. Let me ask you something, sir.You don't think there's some way you could work with me to try and resolve this, do you?Let's look at it this way, what if I can sell you this job at a wholesale price... kind of lessens the burden. The big boss won't get so angry, and maybe won't throw the guy's wife and kids out... at least they'll have a roof over their heads.You got a cup of coffee?Let's just sit down and kick this around. The Wife goes into the kitchen.No hurry, ma'am. The Man turns to sit down, and as he does so, Sam throws a $5 bill on the ground.What you doing throwing your money around? He bends to pick up the $5 note.I found a five-dollar bill, here by the side of the chair. CUT TO: INT. CORRAL CLUB - NIGHTGil says that's where 'Marengay' hangs out.Yeah.What do you expect, it's half price night for divorced women. The place is hopping.I'm beginning to believe in God.No, I'm not saying that, but I'm beginning to give God more thought.I tell ya... I took my wife for lunch yesterday... we went and had some smorgasbord, and it kind of happened.Yeah.Maybe... but I had mine in a smorgasbord.I went to get myself a salad and I started to see all these vegetables, you know how they have all those salads laid out so that when it's time to get to the main course you won't eat too much... that scam to get you filled up so you don't eat too much chicken and beef and all that other stuff.So I see celery, I see the lettuce, tomatoes, cauliflower... and I think, all these things come out of the ground... they just grow out of the ground. They had corn -- out of the ground... radish -- out of the ground. You say to yourself, how can all these things come out of the ground? You know what I'm talking about? All these things are out of the ground.I mean, how can that be? It just happened that way? And I'm not even getting into the fruits... I'm just dealing with vegetables right now. With all those things coming out of the earth, there must be a God.You gotta admit, it's amazing.What about 'Super Highway' in the seventh... it's paying 7 to 1. Ran well in its last race. Gil looking at the newspaper.Who's that?Number four in the fourth -- 'Rider's Revenge' -- 60 to 1, never been in the money. Nice pick, Tilley. Why don't you just throw the twenty dollars in the trash can right now.So, what do ya think?What do you think, 'Sally's pride' in the second? Get me a Bloody Mary.Six. No, I don't like to eat until the third race. Waiter walks off.Mr. Motor.Tilley, this is insane. You're picking horses because you think you're clairvoyant or something.Hallihan's Daughter.You're not exactly talking about a long shot. Mr. Motor, for instance, is coming off at 50 to 1. Tilley taps his forehead, with his eyes closed.Thrifty's Delight -- number four -- 20 bucks.Twenty to one.What are you, crazy? What happens if he wins?He had an accident of some sort.I don't know the whole story.Why didn't you at least give him the six hundred that you pocketed from the six races he lost?Yeah.For crying out loud, why don't you just leave it at that... you win.Let me see what the damage is. Babum... babum... babum... babum... He hands the bill to Mouse.Mouse, figure it out, will ya?Well, sometimes you'll eat more than he does, and it'll even out.Let me get out my notebook. How the fuck do I know what he had?We don't remember, I don't know why.French toast.Take a look at this crap.Home Improvement Commission. With those words there's a genuine moment of concern from all of the tin men -- even Mouse stops singing. Tilley picks up the envelope and pulls out the letter.I think that's the gist of what they're saying. Gil looks over Tilley's shoulder at the letter. Mouse comes over.It's certified.I dunno... I don't know what they've got.They've got nothing concrete against us, because if it's just hearsay stuff, it's neither here nor there.It's better I drop you off.Just air your differences and we'll put an end to this. CUT TO:See how quickly you can clear it up?Come on, let's get out of here. Sam ushers Tilley to the door.You know, when I saw 'Bonanza' the other day, something occurred to me. There's those three guys living on the Ponderosa and you never hear them say anything about wanting to get laid. You never hear Hoss turn to Little Joe and say 'I had such a hard-on when I woke up this morning.' You know ... they never talk about broads ... nothing. Ya never hear Little Joe say 'Hey, Hoss, I went into Virginia City and saw a girl with the greatest ass I ever saw in my life.' Ya just see 'em walking around the Ponderosa saying, 'Yes, Pa,' and 'Where's Little Joe?' Nothing about broads. I don't think I'm being too picky... at least once if they talked about getting horny. I don't care if you're living on the Ponderosa or right here in Baltimore, guys talk about getting laid. I'm beginning to think that show doesn't have too much realism. What do you think, Tilley?Yeah, we'll go and have some lunch at the smorgasbord. CUT TO:It doesn't ring a bell to me either, sir.I don't get the point of this.I'd go along with that as well.We didn't get any leads from them. Their house was not the showplace that we thought it would be. It didn't generate the activity that we had hoped.I need a drink. I hate inquisitions. CUT TO:Ya know, Tilley, we been working together for over a year.I've been thinking that sometimes a different combination makes for better luck. Ya know what I mean? I mean, maybe the two of us ain't the right combination.Let's face it, we're not exactly setting the world on fire.Maybe it's a slump, but like baseball, some time they have to change the lineup to get the team going again.Yeah.I know you're gonna... I know you're gonna.Look, we beat the Commission today ... you know, we got a little bit of a victory. We split right now and maybe we can add to that... you know what I'm saying?Well, I had a conversation with Solly Shavitz, so... maybe I'll go with him.
