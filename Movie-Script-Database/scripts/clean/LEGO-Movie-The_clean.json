And so does everyone else!Hello.I'm Emmet.Well, Larry, I'll have one coffee please.What are those? Sounds a little foofy.Oh. Well, whatever isn't too wild. I don't know, what do you think?Okay, yeah. Cool.Oh, goodness. So much selection. So hard to decide! You pick.Uh. Gosh, which is the most popular?Medium. That's what I'm havin'! That is my style.You creative types! So delightfully sardonic!But it says Kreative right on your shirt! With an extra \"kreative\" spelling aberration! I totally don't get it!Ooh, great.Mmm hmm.Uh huh.Oh, Steve, don't worry. I'm not some kind of foofy weirdo, Steve!Is it for an artist?Oh, great.Wow...What if I mess up or lose my place or something?Overseas? I don't know. I'm not big on travel.One more question.Thank you.

They should make a personnel change of some kind.Yes, the coach!They should so keep him!Really?! Actually, I'm supposed to have dinner with my-- What the heck? I'm in.Cool. Definitely cool. Hey did you hear that song on the way in to work this morning?I think I know why I like that song so much.Because everything is awesome.Oh, uh. I don't know. What?I don't know what happened. I was just looking out at the clouds, and-- It was an accident.Code Danger? What's so dangerous?Oh.--unbelievably sorry. I am honestly the last person who would do something like thi----eriously, a model citizen. I got straight As. I vote! Even in the off-year elections, for school board and stuff----swear, I'm not special at all. Just ask my mom! I'm a totally average normal person!Super grande.You don't need to break me! I'm just a regular old totally UNSPECIAL LAW-ABIDING--I'm Emmet. What's your name?Mom? What are you doing here?But, that's breaking the rules. You told me never to do that.What?But I did something really bad.Mom. You taught me to be a person of principle, and I stand by my principles of doing whatever authority tells me to.Sure.Wh-- what are you doing?Where did you get a blowdart?Half my body is numb! My hand is stuck shut! That seems important!For a misdemeanor! They didn't even decide how long I'd be in there for yet.You don't understand! I was having the best day of my life today. I was one of the guys. We were going to go to a dinner and talk about life and stuff--I was going to call.I made a mistake. I'll explain it to the judge tomorrow and everything will be fine. Only it won't because I can't because suddenly I am an ESCAPED FUGITIVE!You can't protect me my whole life.Mom, I'm going back to jail to repay my debt to society. A society that I would like to be a part of.You have to trust me! I'm my own person. You have to let me grow up and make my own choices--Maybe if you didn't mother me so much I'd have been a little better equipped. Ever think of that?Ugh. You know what you are, Mom? You want to really know? A real pain in the elbow!LEAVE ME ALONE!Mom? Mom!!!!What's happening?!How did you--My mom got kidnapped by ninjas then a lady turned a mailbox into a motorcycle and now we have to catch up to them! Oh, hi, Larry.It's my mom's.Mom! I'm sorry! Don't worry, I'm going to save you!No, I'm not! How do you know my name?You're breaking the speed limit, you know. Not to mention several other laws, as a well as a few other things that are not written into law per se, but are accepted social practices.Lucy?Are you a DJ?So, uh, how have the last seven years been?So. I have a lot of questions.Well, so far...Why did those ninjas take my mom? Why are there ninjas? Are they robotic ninjas? Where have you been the last seven years? When did you gain magical superpowers? Why did you change your name to Gemini? Sounds pretty foofy if you ask me. Also, have you been following me around this whole time? Because that's pretty weird considering last time I saw you was when you dumped me for absolutely no reason.Oh try all of 8th grade!I never have any ideas.Oh, thank goodness, the police are here.Never mind.Get what?The Chosen One? What the heck is that? Wait, you mean me?! I keep telling everyone- I'm just a regular guy!Oh. Really?You're sure I'm not the Chosen One?But-- how-- she has cankles!Okay I did not understand a lot of that.Mom! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.She's gone. I can't believe she's gone... because she tried to protect me...?Who exactly are these evil forces my mom was trying to protect me from? And why are the cops in league with robot ninjas?I'm just getting warmed up.The Black Falcon?Empura? I love their stuff.My mom. My mom?No. The only thing she had that was worth anything was her purse. She takes it with her everywhere. Unfortunately it's now melted to my arm. Ow!Well, I guess it's not in there--November twenty-second.You remember?What is this thing? It's... beautiful.And by that you mean my mom.One will come from land afar, With hand besmirched in shape of star. One to confront a great forsaker, And build a bridge to meet the Maker. This one will make the world right, But first there'll be an awesome fight.Who is my Mom.And if it weren't for me, she'd be here and everything would be okay.What was that?Where are we going?!The MasterBuilders council?Then who?Can't you do it on your own? You were all like, heh-hoo-hiya!Well well well--You're not going to cross the city limits, are you?Everyone knows you're not allowed to go Out of Town. It's dangerous, uncharted and no one should ever go that's what everybody says. Can't we just explain the situation to President Iamnotarobot?Come on. He's just very fair skinned. It says \"Iamnotarobot\" in his very name! Besides, he's way better than Councilman Strawman. That guy is the pits.What's na\u00efve?My mom gave it to me and I'm not giving it to anyone unless their name is My Mom.Well then I guess I am.Well then go ahead and do it I shall.Okay, okay.Who are those guys?Where are we? Where are all the buildings? And coffee shops?Who are they?So he controls all these worlds?Is it much farther?What's that supposed to mean?Who could live here?I see.Lovely place.Like an old bat...My mother has been kidnapped and it's all my fault.Why is he being so weird?You taught my parents...We're here because we don't know what to do and you might. Sir, all I've ever wanted was to get along with everyone and be a part of the world and now I don't know if there's going to be a world to be a part of. That is, unless you help me fix it. And I bet if you do, they'll forget all about what they used to think of you.Who is this Maker you guys keep talking about?Okay that sounds super weird.And what's the Kragle again?--destroy the world?Oh is that all we have to do? That doesn't sound too hard. Oh wait, I forgot to mention, I am saying this with a sarcastic inflection.Better.How long has your boyfriend had his own ship?I just think it's interesting that you're attracted to someone with his own vessel. Fairly superficial to date a guy with his own yacht.Huh. Not what I expected.Really not what I expected.Wow.Okay. That's-- okay.That's surprisingly gracious--Alright. Sure.Alright. Sure.Thank you for your clarity.What's our move?It's Emmet.Yes. What are you doing?What's it for?Okay, here's what I don't get. If our lives really are predetermined by some all-controlling dude, what is the point of doing anything?OW! Why did you do that?!Or you did it yourself because you're a crazy person.I could just never make something like that. How did you even get the idea?Teach me.No. Teach me to do what you do.I'm not sure I follow...MakerPeepers?Oh no! Wait! It got out...What are they doing?But we'll sink!I don't get it-- What do I do?Like for an attic?Well...Hey Lucy, you gotta see--Does the Black Falcon know about this place?Oh, uh, I'm Emmet. This is my ex- girlfriend Lucy, also a blind man, a pirate head, and a loud dog. We're here to save the world.For Kreativity...Why did you build all this stuff?You know we really don't have time--No, rules were meant to be followed.You guys are really weird.This is crazy. You can't have a society without rules. I mean, your castle doesn't look very structurally sound at all!I wish that made sense to me.Hello.Cool!Um, maybe if it didn't have two fronts and no back, and it didn't have five wings.What did you say you do again?Ah.This guy is supposed to be inspiring? More like conspiring... with a bunch of mean jerks who have my mom! You're just as bad as them, you big mean jerk!Mom! I'm coming! I won't let you down. Any more than I already have!Mom! No!You're a MasterBuilder, too?We can't leave you here.Over there!I built that chair! Check it out. That's my chair. Pretty good.Well, it was my idea to get in the catapult.No idea.My chair!!!!Can't sleep. Kind of still upset about everything, you know?Well, I got in a fight with my mom that caused her to get kidnapped and the whole world is about to get frozen, if you must know, unless you were asking that sarcastically, which I now realize you were.I hope so.I thought you said I didn't have a creative bone in my body.That's nice, thank you.You know what you are, Lucy?A real pain in the elbow.What?Thank you?Think of how I felt. My mom trained me to follow the herd. To lay low. All I ever wanted was to fit in, to have friends. And the funny thing is, maybe I was trying too hard, but, my whole life, I never did have any real friends.That's the most dramatic time in anyone's life, right? It's what made The Black Falcon such a world class dingaling.Yeah.It's... beautiful.Yeah. I do.Yeah. Okay.No. Definitely not. Hey, Can I ask you something? I keep having these strange dreams about a squishy bumpy giant--What does it mean? Do I have a fate?Why do you always talk in weird riddles? I just want answers.I'm sorry, that's lame.No I'm not. I'm just copying what you did.That makes no sense!It's okay. I have a plan.This R2 unit had the plans for Empura Tower stored in its memory bank.Looking over it last night, I noticed the tower follows the same construction principles as the condos I was building back in Legopolis.We enter through the base here. Batman, you'll take out all the guards, while the rest of us change into their uniforms, and, posing as the new guards, determine my mother's location. What about a passkey, you ask? We won't need a passkey or whatever security code they have because we'll sneak up the elevator shaft by building our own elevator, which we then take all the way to--Wait.... be so heavy it will fall under its own weight...Unless...We get a bunch of snacks and a conference room filled with toys and funny posters, and discuss the plan in a group. We'll have rules of play, such as 'Yes and,' not `No, but' so we can keep criticism constructive and keep the process moving forward, and slowly over many iterations of the process we'll add the best thoughts from everyone until we have a plan that's more robust and creative than anything any of us could have come up with on his or her own!Or we can just wing it.The Black Falcon's office!Me too. This is really sad. How can you keep living like this?Wait. Batman, give me your Batperiscope.Now at least you can see each other.Mom...It's me, Mom. I've here to save you, so you can save the world.Mom! Hurry!No!Mom, I'm so sorry.Just- tell me everything's going to be okay.Mom... Why didn't you -- why didn't you teach me what you knew?I know you're the Chosen One, but-- I just wish you had let me choose for myself.They got promoted...But you didn't do anything.The world is ending.Ow!Mom. Go. Do whatever you're supposed to do!Do what? What can I do?A what?You play golf?You like me?Neckbeard likes me?But... I'm not the Chosen One.Nuh uh.This.I don't know. It just came to me.So...not square.The Maker. It's all real...What the heck are you?!I'm a person. You on the other hand are a giant squishy beast.So ugly...What are these?!AHHHHHH!!!Did you build that?Are you the Maker?Two Makers?The Kragle. The thing that is freezing everything together.Good Lord.But then-- it can never change.But... nothing is perfect unless it can change. You can make something, you know, and it can be great, for a while, but then... then someone maybe adds to it, makes something new out of it. And that keeps happening until it becomes something that a single person could never envision. Truth is, creating alone is never as good as creating with others.I know. You want to control everything. I get it. But if you succeed, in the end, all you'll ever have is what you've got.Who knows? That's the best part.What is it?Thank you. It was nice to meet you both, disgusting squishy giant Maker creature and smaller, messier giant Maker creature.I should go save the world now.Thanks for dropping in.Mom... Wow. Just... wow.I guess that makes two of us.I love you, Mom.Lucy? How did you do that?You're right.

Shoot.Hardly.By the way, I'm seeing someone now, so don't get any ideas.You don't get it, do you?They're here for the Chosen One.Not you. Your mom.I was sent to get her, but they got to her first.Emmet, your mother is the most powerful being in the universe.Don't we all.She and I belong to an ancient brotherhood of MasterBuilders, who create from our imaginations, not instructions, forced underground by evil forces. She has long been in hiding to protect you from those forces. I was sent to summon her, but when I showed up she was too busy breaking you out of prison.Just hold the wheel.How... Emmet! Jump!It didn't break. How?You have a lot of questions.They all work for the Black Falcon.Otherwise known as Rodrigo Falcone, the C.E.O. of Empura?He is also the self-declared Emperor of all known LEGO realms. He kidnapped your mom because she is the only one who can stop him from destroying us all.Emmet, did your mom have a safe deposit box, a safe, something where she would have hidden something very valuable?No...no...no...no...no...no... No...no...no...no...no...no...No...no...no...no...no...no...It's not in there.What's her birthday?Of course. Your birthday. January six.Not by choice.The MasterPiece.Some say it's the first piece ever. No one knows exactly what it does, but it is said the Chosen One will use it to one day save the world.There's an inscription.The prophecy of the Chosen One...Yes. We have to get this to your mom so she can fulfill her destiny and stop the Black Falcon before he destroys us all.What was what?We have to go. NOW.We're going to take the MasterPiece to someone who can help.No. They're gone. All of them.Vitruvius. He was once a great MasterBuilder, now he's...retired. But he's our only hope.I can't, I'm...still in training. I'm not a full-fledged MasterBuilder yet. Technically, I'm an intern.Don't be a putz, Emmet.Iamnotarobot is one of the Black Falcon's robot henchmen. Ever notice how metallic he looks?Don't be na\u00efve.That.Look, just give me the MasterPiece and I'll take it from here.Well then I guess you're going to have to cross that line.Well then go ahead and do it.Dude!Not everything is what it seems...Annoying short whiners. Plus they reproduce like crazy. It's a real problem.Legopolis is only one realm in the Black Falcon's dominion. He built walls around all of them so he can keep them separate. If the walls came down, he'd have a hard time controlling the results. The MasterBuilders built secret passages through the walls so we could travel between lands.The Black Falcon's sentries. They're looking for us.Shh!Do you ever say something that isn't a stupid question?I guess not.That's Dragon.A blind man.His mother is the Chosen One. I was sent to summon her. The Black Falcon got to her first. He has the Kragle.The other MasterBuilders are gone.Vitruvius, you can still help us.Hope?That's super constructive, thank you.We don't have that kind of time!Why do you care?It's not exactly a yacht.Gosh, where are my manners? Emmet, this is Neckbeard, my boyfriend. Neckbeard, this is Emmet. We used to date a million zillion years ago. It meant nothing to me. You have heard of Vitruvius, of course.He has an incredible mind.Vitruvius, follow my lead.That's the idea.Build a hatch.Like for a submarine.That's as far as you got?!That's the security?Emmet. He doesn't get out much.And where do you come from?Okay. Um, he's a MasterBuilder?No thank you.Is this everyone?King Karl! You betrayed us! You betrayed everything you stand for!No no he's just on teleconference.It's like a phone. A telegram. He's not actually in the room.Sure.So wait. What was the purpose of this call then?We have to go now!That's far more impressive than this entire Rocket-Copter.A credit hog. Great.Benny! Focus!What's up?Upset about what?Sorry.We'll find her.I know it. I know you.You don't.I'm just trying to help.What?You may not have a creative bone in your body, but you have a lot of really really earnest bones. You always did.I mean, that day when we were kids, and you drew the face in art class, you inspired me. I thought maybe there was more out there in the world, and maybe you felt the same. That's why I asked you out. But then you ended up like everyone else and broke my heart, you know? That I was going one way and you didn't go with me.We're being so dramatic. It was eighth grade!It made a lot of us dingalings.You know, whenever I doubt myself, I look into this prism I found long ago...I know. It's a relic of the Maker. When I'm feeling low, I look at it, and it always makes me feel like there still is beauty in the world, and we all have a purpose. You know what I mean?Well, good night.How the heck are we going to do this?Really?That's convenient.What about this?We put the guards to sleep with gas. Then build a kickass window- washing apparatus, which, unbeknownst to the baddies, will have all kinds of cool weapons inside and...Darn.Stop it! Everyone!We don't have time for that.I love you please move in with me.Emmet.They won't budge.That's pretty elaborate.Why won't anything in this hallway break off?!Yes?Me too...Are you really doing this?Um...That guy?!Excuse me.She's too weak. You have to do it.I believe in you, Emmet. I was mad because you disappointed me for a while, but since it wasn't your fault, I'm willing to give you a mulligan on it.A mulligan. It's from golf.The point is, you've spent your whole life wanting to fit in and have friends, by pretending to be something you're not. But now that you've let the real you shine through, you've made some friends who like you for who you are. And even if they're just a crazy spaceman and a pirate head and a blind man and an intern--I do....Sure.You wanted to make your own choices, right? So choose yourself.What do we do?Neckbeard!

I'm sure the active MasterBuilders are more than adequate.I guess I'm not redundant anymore.The Black Falcon was my student.He was clever and smart. It was the age of the MasterBuilders. The world was a fluid, creative place. The most gifted were enrolled in MasterBuilder High School...I only aimed to teach him a lesson about the impermanence of creation.He became enraged. Instead of improving his work, it became stagnant and weak. He began to amass power, and hunt down MasterBuilders. Harvesting their ideas. Forcing them to write instructions for him. Instructions that he in turn forced on the world. The remaining MasterBuilders went into hiding. I was encouraged to retire.They were probably right.Your mother went into hiding to protect you. Your father never had a chance...That's flattery, my dear. We both know you're only here because you have no other place to go.I wish I could, young man, but he has the Kragle, and he has the Chosen One, and if he has the Chosen One, he has the MasterPiece. And without that, there is no--The Kragle is the most powerful relic of the Maker.The Maker. The being who put us all together and watches over us. Only by following the inspiration of the Maker can one become a true MasterBuilder.It is, but then all the best things are.Every so often, the Maker drops a piece down to us that is unique, unlike any other. This crystal table is but one example. Some of them, in the wrong hands, can be weaponized. The Kragle, if harnessed, could--Yes. The Black Falcon has taken your mother, the one person who can stop him, and imprisoned her.If we can travel across sea and land, penetrate his heavily- guarded fortress, unkidnap Master Doris, and bring the MasterPiece safely to her, she can use it to destroy the Kragle, and set the world right.We need to assemble a team of all remaining MasterBuilders hiding throughout the lands. We'll scour the countryside high and low, overturning rocks, hiding from sentries, avoiding the major roads and air..Or we could send out a mass email to the MasterBuilders list, and have whichever ones are remaining meet us at the midpoint.And then, we sail for the Land of Unused Parts! Anybody got a ship?That was a long time ago.Lucy. Welcome.Ah. You got your sea legs, yet?Making.What is anything for? It's what we were all meant to do. What the Maker has fated us to do.The Maker fated me to.Ah. Now, you're learning.I didn't. I just opened a window for it to fly through.Birds are, incidentally, one of the most creative of all the animals. They build nests. Create elaborate courtship rituals, make gifts for one another. And of course, their beautiful songs.Open your throat and make a sound.How can I teach you something you already know? It's already inside you. You've walled it up, but it still shines through. That terrific disaster you caused at the instruction site? That was no accident.They say every night the Maker puts a blanket over the world, a blanket with tiny holes. Some call them stars, but I call them MakerPeepers.MakerPeepers. Emmet, there was a time, before you were born, when making new things came as naturally to everyone as breathing. The world was messy and wild, and that made it beautiful. But then, everything became rigid and prefabricated, so everyone just stopped thinking of new things. Making has been outsourced to Empura. The Black Falcon has paved over the world that was.And yet, somehow, light still shines through the cracks.Isn't that marvelous? You have an idea, and then off it goes!Collaborating.Legotopia. The last free kingdom in the universe.Thank you.It's been hidden for ages by the fog and its remote location. Plus they have elaborate security measures.Emmet, these people are not MasterBuilders. They do not create with purpose, they create just to create. But they can also be very inspiring, because the only way to accomplish the impossible is to break the rules of what is possible.It will if you let it. King Karl, I wish we came to you with better news.We are all that remain of the once proud society of MasterBuilders. Except for Duplo. And Emmet. He's not a MasterBuilder, he's just the son of one. And Lucy, who is still an intern.Along with a blind man, a pirate head, a crazy spaceman, and Batman...Together, we form a fellowship of the MasterPiece. A shining beacon of possibility, and the only thing that can counteract the power of the Kragle. If we can get this into the hands of the Chosen One--Black Falcon! Prepare to meet the Maker!What?Like a crystal ball?I don't suppose this is the restroom?Visions of the Maker. Quite unusual.We all have a fate. But MasterBuilding is about channeling the power of the Maker, and taking that fate into our own hands. I guess it could mean what you choose to make it mean.Then why don't you try building something for yourself?Not bad. You're learning now.A dilettante borrows. A true artist steals.And all this does?How about this?We build a second tower right next to the first. The whole thing will be an optical illusion, matching exactly the visual of the landscape behind the tower. I'll be the foreman, and--What, is it because I'm blind?Creativity in groups is hard.Rodrigo Falcone. My old student. It's time you went back to SCHOOL! RUN!What is? Describe it to me. I feel really really left out!You have channeled the Maker and chosen your fate. You have chosen to be the Chosen One.The connection between a mother and son is a powerful thing.On the contrary. It's connections like those that give the best chance to survive...", "clean_line": "hello hi thank deprived sight hearing acute perceive physical world echolocation precisely ears help extremely tall fat stranger mmm hard pass interested oh grave news afraid retired sure active masterbuilders adequate guess redundant anymore black falcon student clever smart age masterbuilders world fluid creative place gifted enrolled masterbuilder high school aimed teach lesson impermanence creation enraged instead improving work stagnant weak began amass power hunt masterbuilders harvesting ideas forcing write instructions instructions turn forced world remaining masterbuilders went hiding encouraged retire probably right mother went hiding protect father chance flattery dear know place wish young man kragle chosen chosen masterpiece kragle powerful relic maker maker watches following inspiration maker true masterbuilder best things maker drops piece unique unlike crystal table example wrong hands weaponized kragle harnessed yes black falcon taken mother person stop imprisoned travel sea land penetrate heavily guarded fortress unkidnap master doris bring masterpiece safely use destroy kragle set world right need assemble team remaining masterbuilders hiding lands ll scour countryside high low overturning rocks hiding sentries avoiding major roads air send mass email masterbuilders list whichever ones remaining meet midpoint sail land unused parts anybody got ship long time ago lucy welcome ah got sea legs making meant maker fated maker fated ah learning opened window fly birds incidentally creative animals build nests create elaborate courtship rituals gifts course beautiful songs open throat sound teach know inside ve walled shines terrific disaster caused instruction site accident night maker puts blanket world blanket tiny holes stars makerpeepers makerpeepers emmet time born making new things came naturally breathing world messy wild beautiful rigid prefabricated stopped thinking new things making outsourced empura black falcon paved world light shines cracks isn marvelous idea goes collaborating legotopia free kingdom universe thank hidden ages fog remote location plus elaborate security measures emmet people masterbuilders create purpose create create inspiring way accomplish impossible break rules possible let king karl wish came better news remain proud society masterbuilders duplo emmet masterbuilder son lucy intern blind man pirate head crazy spaceman batman form fellowship masterpiece shining beacon possibility thing counteract power kragle hands chosen black falcon prepare meet maker like crystal ball suppose restroom visions maker unusual fate masterbuilding channeling power maker taking fate hands guess mean choose mean try building bad learning dilettante borrows true artist steals build second tower right thing optical illusion matching exactly visual landscape tower ll foreman blind creativity groups hard rodrigo falcone old student time went school run feel left channeled maker chosen fate chosen chosen connection mother son powerful thing contrary connections like best chance survive"}}}
