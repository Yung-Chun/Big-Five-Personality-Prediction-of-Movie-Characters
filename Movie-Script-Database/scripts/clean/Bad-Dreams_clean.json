He reminds me that I was supposed to go with them that night--Through the fire. To the next world. They waited while I was in a coma...

I can keep him away.She's espousing a total belief system. A kind of holistic healing matrix not unlike the dynamic energy shift model. Isn't that interesting? They're adopting it, embracing it.Why not?Alan. We've opened primary channels of communication. You've opened them, Alan. Let's not rush to throw away our progress. Neuroses are hardly contagious. A few weeks in the group won't hurt Cynthia. With luck, she'll overcome her memory trauma. That would mean progress... not to Mention getting Lieutenant Wasserman off my back. In the meantime...She seems to like you. See if you can get her to open up, and let's press on. With a united front?How about psychotic episode?Addictive personalities can be borderline. You know that--There's other kinds of addictions. we see it in these fringe religious groups... these instant creeds with pseudo-Messianic delusions. You've heard how she talks about Unity House? Perhaps that's her drug. Perhaps she's going through a--withdrawal of sorts. Her memory lapses about Unity House are equally symptomatic... There's some violent turmoil under that pretty little facade.No.I believe she went into that coma a disturbed young lady. Fifteen years later... nothing has changed.Found out what? Lieutenant, if I called the police every time one of my patients experienced a fantasy or a delusion, you'd have to move in here--The security guard didn't see anyone--Wonderful! Wonderful! I've been waiting and waiting for her to finally show real anger--real emotion! This could be a breakthrough! Thank you, Lieutenant.Well. You must be pleased. Closing a case after... what is it, twelve years?Well, Alan. Still think she doesn't belong in the group?Fascinating.Possible.I'd call it a tragic coincidence. Unfortunately, Borderline Personality Disorder is indicative of a pre-existing disposition towards suicidal tendencies.As that is a police matter, I am not at liberty to comment on it.That's completely absurd. Where do you get this nonsense?Ah... I have work to do. No further questions.Isolation.Dr. Goldman, I know you're fond of the girl, but you're out of line.Goldman!It's an extraordinarily complex situation, severe identity crisis compounded with the multiple shock of these deaths. She's reverting to this total belief system from the commune through an intermittent psychosis that puts ideology above her life itself--Doctor Goldman. I believe your tenure with my clinic has just come to an end. Security? Would you please escort Dr. Goldman off the premises?Dr. Goldman.Eternal bliss.Let her go. She needs it.Let her go. Let her go and I'll forget your disobedience.You'll be with them, Dr. Goldman, Be happy.I'm afraid it's too late for that.I have no peers. Hello, Lieutenant. Forgive me for not getting up.Well. I don't agree with your definition of justice, but I suppose I obstructed it... All in the name of science, of course----but as to murder, well, Lieutenant, I beg to differ. I didn't kill anyone. Why would I? I'm only interested in knowledge. Cynthia is a unique girl--the product of an environment and a philosophy unrivaled in its purity.

Look... we've all done it... tumbled out of bed positive that we've just lived something that was only a dream--Okay. First off, we're all going to feel a little silly and maybe look a little silly...--but this technique works, and we're going to release some of our hidden aggression. Who's going to go first? Lana?None, Lana. They're polyester. Ed? Want to start?All right, how about if we all start together and eliminate the wimp factor. Come on.Okay. What are we feeling?Ralph. Miriam?Please, people, let's work at being serious.I know you had a rough night. But you have to participate.Okay, that's better. Now let's hear some emotion. Let it out. yell! Scream!If that's what happened, why didn't you find any evidence of arson?What's that supposed to mean?I think she's fucking freaked out about Lana!Ladies. Good to see you socializing, Cynthia.How are you feeling?Good.Cynthia?Jesus.Cynthia, we're all upset by what's happened. But let's not get--Cynthia, please...I didn't want you to be alone.Looks like I was right.I don't know if you want to hear this or not, and frankly, I don't care.You are no more responsible for those deaths twelve hours ago than you are for the ones twelve years ago.Thinking otherwise is putting you in a self-replicating spiral of depression. And that puts me in a bind... What do I do, write more prescriptions? You need to face reality, not get medicated out of it...Damn it, Cynthia, you can't run away from this--Good! Get mad--get angry--but not at me--at these fantasies--!Miriam and Lana were both deeply disturbed women. Miriam tried to kill herself before. Lana was obsessed with the morbid... You heard her in the sessions. You can't twist what they did into something other than what it was.Now what?Damn it, Cynthia, come back--!Shit--!Cynthia--!It's all right--it's all right--Yes. We're not sure what happened... There was evidence that they were drinking... They fell into... the main turbine.Ralph, as for your own safety, you are being given the most amount of protection possible.Isn't this a coincidence?Believe it or not, this is the safest place for you to be. The police are here. There are doctors here. And I'm going to keep you company, all night. I even brought provisions.Pure unadulterated junk. At this point, who cares about the chemicals?Try harder next time.Yes, they are. Everyone's under protection. Nothing can happen.I was going to ask you the same thing.Shit! It's his tranquilizer! If he doesn't take this, he'll completely flip out--!Was he behaving strangely?Cynthia!What did she say happened?I have to go with her. Where is she being taken?Isolation? Are you out of your mind? That girl needs human contact--connection--isolation is the worst thing you can do--Shit. You want her on the edge, don't you... You want to play your theory out to the end--Fuck ideology! Fuck you, Berrisford! You can't use a human being as a guinea pig-- You have to stop this. Call it off--I'll--I'll sign her into police custody if I can stay on as her physician--Tell Berrisford he can use it for a bookmark. Maybe then he can find his dick without a road map.Brilliant. Do we feel better now? No. Yes. Maybe.It's okay, officer. I'll write myself a prescription in the morning.Show me the scrips for the therapy group--Shit, this is all standard stuff--Do you fill these prescriptions?Fuck!Read it. Pesco, Ralph--READ IT! What's he down for?Is that Lithium?Tell me about it--What's this? And this? And this?Please, Hettie, I need your help.Cynthia! Cynthia!No. Cynthia, please. I'm not going to be able to come back, but you have to listen! Berrisford's been tampering with the medication for everybody in the group--that's why they've been committing suicide--he's been making them crazy--A drug induced psychotic state is very suggestible. All we've hearing for days is \"Harris, Harris,\"... so that's what we all saw... That's what I saw when I took Ralph's pill! It's all part of Berrisford's plan--he has this fucked-up theory about how you still think you're part of the Unity House, and the only way he can prove it is if you want to kill yourself!Do you hear me?! He's going to want you to kill yourself! He's recreating the whole thing for you! But you can't listen to him!Shit!Where's Berrisford?Where is he? He's going to kill Cynthia! Tell me where he is!Cynthia, take my hand... Just relax... Think about what you're doing... Stay calm... I want you to take my hand...You piece of shit!No!Cynthia! Open your eyes! Open your eyes!Pull up! Pull yourself up so I can got a grip on you!No!You didn't see shit! Hold on!No! Cynthia, Harris doesn't exist! He's dead! Look at who that is! Look at him! Look!Goddamn you! Goddamn you!Publish this, asshole!Don't you hear him? He's trying to bribe me--but I'm not letting go! I'll go with you, but I'm not letting go!Cynthia, help us! Help us both!No!Cynthia, don't let him kill you! Don't let him do this!Your life has a purpose... to bring joy and happiness! You're part of my life now. That's an unfinished story, too...It's okay. It's over. It was Berrisford. He killed them.It was Berrisford. He shot you up with hallucinogens. What he didn't do, you imagined.Victorian. Looks like it was a nice house once.What?What's the matter?Let's go.You sure?Cynthia?Are you all right?", "clean_line": "ralph sit cut shit okay ralph cynthia doctor goldman time checked borderline personality accurately placed neurosis psychosis arc personality syndrome encompasses identity crises chemical addictions emotionalism anxiety finished dr berrisford explain offer practical suggestion talk cynthia close gilda hasn said words weeks cynthia comes love peace woodstock routine presto missing bad follow dr berrisford people group deeply disturbed cynthia belong experiment session fine long run united sure buy lunch impressed sure follow alan doctor goldman father grandfather think baby toy stethoscope parents died child haven able locate relatives cynthia aren old hands left injured took gone afraid look cynthia saying upset sooner realize phase life better going bring open talk group oh ride somebody hit thanks said easy works lot people cynthia lot patients ve coma decade struggles crowded elevator catches arms cynthia cynthia happened alive hallucination flashback know fit pattern history drug abuse borderline group long place vacant cynthia double closet isn exactly positive apartment match general description cynthia look ve tumbled bed positive ve lived dream okay going feel little silly maybe look little silly technique works going release hidden aggression going lana lana polyester ed want start right start eliminate wimp factor come okay feeling ralph miriam people let work know rough night participate okay better let hear emotion let yell scream happened evidence arson supposed mean think fucking freaked lana ladies good socializing cynthia feeling good cynthia jesus cynthia upset happened let cynthia want looks like right know want hear frankly care responsible deaths hours ago ones years ago thinking putting self replicating spiral depression puts bind write prescriptions need face reality medicated damn cynthia run away good mad angry fantasies miriam lana deeply disturbed women miriam tried kill lana obsessed morbid heard sessions twist damn cynthia come shit cynthia right right yes sure happened evidence drinking fell main turbine ralph safety given protection possible isn coincidence believe safest place police doctors going company night brought provisions pure unadulterated junk point cares chemicals try harder time yes protection happen going ask thing shit tranquilizer ll completely flip behaving strangely cynthia happened taken isolation mind girl needs human contact connection isolation worst thing shit want edge want play theory end fuck ideology fuck berrisford use human guinea pig stop ll ll sign police custody stay physician tell berrisford use bookmark maybe dick road map brilliant feel better yes maybe okay officer ll write prescription morning scrips therapy group shit standard stuff prescriptions fuck read pesco ralph read lithium tell hettie need help cynthia cynthia cynthia going able come listen berrisford tampering medication everybody group ve committing suicide making crazy drug induced psychotic state suggestible ve hearing days harris harris saw saw took ralph pill berrisford plan fucked theory think unity house way prove want kill hear going want kill recreating thing listen shit berrisford going kill cynthia tell cynthia hand relax think stay calm want hand piece shit cynthia open eyes open eyes pull pull got grip shit hold cynthia harris exist dead look look look goddamn goddamn publish asshole hear trying bribe letting ll letting cynthia help help cynthia let kill let life purpose bring joy happiness life unfinished story okay berrisford killed berrisford shot hallucinogens imagined victorian looks like nice house matter let sure cynthia right"}}}
