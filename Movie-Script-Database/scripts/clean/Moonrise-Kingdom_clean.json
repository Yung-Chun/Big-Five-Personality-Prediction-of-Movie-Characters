{"Moonrise-Kingdom": {"SAM": {"raw_line": "What kind of bird are you?No, I said, \"What kind of bird are you?\"I'll be leaving soon.What happened to your hand?Really. How'd that happen?Sam. What's yours?Were you followed?Good.Did you bring a cat?Can you read a map?I do cartography.I feel we should go halfway today and halfway tomorrow, since you're a less experienced hiker, and you're wearing Sunday-school shoes.Here's where we are right now. I'd like to pitch camp here by sixteen-hundred . How does that sound?You want some beef jerky?Let's go.Are you thirsty?Well, if your throat gets parched, stick a pebble in your mouth and suck on it. You can quench your thirst with the spit, supposedly.Sometimes I stick leaves under my hat. It cools your head down.True, but this adds camouflage.Here's a trick. Throw grass in the air, and you can see which direction the wind's blowing.Unknown. I guess it doesn't really matter, as long as we cover our tracks.These might be poisonous.Not bad. Anyway, they're good for survival.I agree. Why do you say that?You smell like perfume.I brought water, too.Should we catch him?Trout bait. We need worms.You're right. We'll let him live. Maybe I've got a licorice whip.How strong of a swimmer are you?OK. Well, I'm not that strong of a swimmer, so I wear a life-preserver. I think it's a good policy to get in the habit, anyway.Watch out for turtles. They'll bite you, if you put your fingers in their mouths. Let me see if I can catch this one.Somebody wrote on him.You got one!Fish on hook! Reel him in! Slowly.You're doing good.This is for fishing.I'm a Khaki Scout. It's what I'm trained for.Anyway, I used to be.We can feed your cat the guts and eyeballs.What else did you bring? We should make an inventory.Go ahead.That's it? No mess-kit? No flashlight? No canteen? No waterproof matches? Didn't you get the packing list I sent you in my last letter?That's OK. We can share.These are all library books. In my school you're only allowed to check-out one at a time. Some of these are going to be overdue.Do you steal?Why? You're not poor.Are you depressed?How come?Does that mean you?To me, it is.I'm sorry.I'm on your side.Which one's the best?Dear Suzy, You have a superb voice. You were my favorite animal in the program, by far. Please, find enclosed --Dear Suzy, I am sorry your brothers are so selfish. Maybe they will grow out of it. Sometimes people do things without knowing the reasons for --Dear Suzy, I accidentally built a fire while I was sleep-walking. I have no memory of this, but my foster parents think I am lying. Unfortunately, it is --Dear Suzy, I have been trying very hard to make friends, but I feel people do not like my personality. In fact, I can understand why they might --Dear Suzy, I know your parents hurt your feelings, but they still love you. That is more important. If they --Dear Suzy, Here is my plan.Dear Suzy, When?Dear Suzy, Walk four hundred yards due north from your house to the dirt path which has not got any name on it. Turn right and follow to the end.I will meet you in the meadow.Rats! I should've put more pine needles on it. Let's go. We're almost there.What do you creeps want?Why?No, I'm not. Didn't you get my letter of resignation? I quit the Khaki Scouts.Listen to some reason: I don't like you. You don't like me. Why don't you stupid idiots just let us disappear?Do not cross this stick.It was him or us.They got Snoopy through the neck.No, he doesn't. He needs a morgue.Suzy. Look at me. Snoopy's not going to make it.They're after us. We got to move.It's too late! He's already gone!I'm sorry I had to do that, but you're panicking. The first rule in any emergency is you never --Who's to say -- but he didn't deserve to die.I know!On three!Me, neither.Let's change it. What should it be?I made you some jewelry.Are your ears pierced?Do you mind?Tilt your head sideways.Why do you always use binoculars?That sounds like poetry. Poems don't always have to rhyme, you know. They're just supposed to be creative.What do you want to be? When you grow up.Go on adventures, too. Not get stuck, too. I guess that sounds almost like I'm just repeating what you just said, but I couldn't think of anything as good as it. On the other hand, maybe we'll get blown up by an atom bomb. You can't predict the exact future.It's possible I may wet the bed, by the way. Later, I mean.I wish I didn't have to mention it, but just in case. I don't want to make you be offended.Some people frown on these problems.It's not an accomplishment. I inherited it from my mother. It's actually not meant for a male to wear -- but I don't give a damn.I don't think so. We're getting to know each other better. I feel like I'm in a family now. Not like yours, but similar to one.I love you, but you don't know what you're talking about.I don't know.Not to my recollection.They can't invite me back.I gave them too much aggravation.I admit we knew we'd get in trouble. That part's true. We knew people would be worried, and we still ran away, anyway -- but something also happened which we didn't do on purpose. When we first met each other. Something happened to us.Maybe so. Anyway, you're a bachelor.That's true. Did you love someone ever?What happened?Ah.Thanks.A drunk truck driver smashed into them.Get out of my chimney.No, thanks.It's worthless to me. There's no point. Not without Suzy.How'd you get here?Diversion tactics. Good thinking.Where we going?Can we trust him?Did you leave another note for Lionel?That's true.Field Mate Sam Shakusky, Troop 55, resigned.Yes, sir.Thank you, sir. By the way, where's the chapel tent?I want to bring my wife.I guess we better try to pretend we're struggling over our decision for a minute before we go back over there and tell him --What? Why? How?I don't know what to say.She left her binoculars on a hook in the chapel tent.We can't. It's her magic power!You killed your dog, by the way.Why do you consider me your enemy?She's my wife now.I'm saying before that. Six weeks ago. From day one. What'd I do wrong? I'm trying to understand. Why don't you like me?I'm OK.Follow me!How deep is it? I didn't bring my life jacket.OK.Wait. Just in case this is a suicide, orthey capture us, and we never see each other again anymore -- thank you for marrying me.

It might help also if you didn't wear fur.Which way?No, they're huckleberries, in fact. Try one.He knows someone's watching him.I don't know. I just think he can feel us.It's my mother's.What for?No.Pretty good. I broke our school record for the back-stroke.OK.The stick's moving!Sit down!Very good. You know a lot about camping, don't you?That's OK. He only eats cat food.OK.This is my record player. It works with batteries. Actually, it belongs to my little brother Lionel. I left him a note. Do you like music?This is my favorite record album. My godmother gave it to me for my birthday. She lives in France.These are my books. I like stories with magic powers in them. Either in kingdoms on earth or on foreign planets. Also, time-travel, if they make it realistic. Usually, I prefer a girl hero, but not always. I couldn't bring all of them because it got too heavy. You can borrow any you want.I also brought my lefty scissors because I'm left-handed, my toothbrush, some rubber bands, extra batteries, and my binoculars, as you know. I forgot my comb.I thought that's what you're supposed to bring. I don't own a canteen.I might turn some of them back in one day. I haven't decided yet. I know it's bad. I think I just took them to have a secret to keep. Anyway, for some reason, it makes me feel in a better mood sometimes.Well, I can show you an example, if you want -- but it doesn't make me feel very good. I found this on top of our refrigerator.It's not funny.You really know how to make friends.That's OK.I know.His eyes downcast, his kingdom in ruins, Mynar pressed his heavy paw through the rippling surface of the cool shallows and down to its stone floor. \"My people once were lead by a great and noble beast -- and I no longer see his face in this reflection.\"Meanwhile, on the Plains of Tabitha, Francine rested. There would be another time for war.Dear Sam, Thank you very much. I got replaced as the raven because I yelled at Mrs. Lynn. After that I was only a blue jay, but --Dear Sam, You are an excellent painter, especially trees and telephone poles. Is the girl in the water supposed to be me? My favorite color is --Dear Sam, I am in trouble again because I threw a rock through the window. My mother still has glass in her hair. Also --Dear Sam, Now I am getting suspended because I got in a fight with Molly. She says I go berserk. Our principal is against me. Why do --Dear Sam, I do think you should think of their faces every day, even if it makes you sad. It is too bad they did not leave you more pictures of themselves. Can you --Dear Sam, My answer is yes.Dear Sam, Where?They found the canoe.Why not?Maybe you just don't know him.Oh, no.He needs a doctor.He's losing blood. Hurry. Where do we go?Don't say that.He's dying! We can't just leave him!Stop yelling at me!Don't ever do that again. No one's allowed to slap me.You're right. He's dead.Was he a good dog?This is weird.I like it here, but I don't like the name.Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet. It's got no ring to it.Let me think for a minute.It's pretty. Do the other one.It feels hard.I like it.You can touch my chest.They're going to grow more.It helps me see things closer. Even if they're not very far away. I pretend it's my magic power.I don't know. I want to go on adventures, I think. Not get stuck in one place. How about you?That's true.OK.Of course, I won't.What's that one for?Are your foster parents still mad at you? For getting in trouble so much.I always wished I was an orphan. Most of my favorite characters are. I think your lives are more special.I love you, too.The flashlight's beam drew a moon through the black across the attic and settled on a gap in the base-board. A mouse-hole, no bigger than a pocket-watch. Eric crouched on his flat feet and placed his hand in front of the tiny opening. \"It's windy,\" he said. \"Like someone in there's blowing on my fingers.\" Christy rolled her eyes and sighed a sigh. He's right again, she thought. Little brothers drive people crazy.Part Two.That was a lie.Good. I want to be.What does it say?Why not?Let me read it.That's child abuse.I'd be careful if I were you. One of these days somebody's going to be pushed too far, and who knows what they're capable of.It's a warning.I wish I knew what makes you tick.I hate you.Why not? I mean it.Exactly. I know what you do with that sad, dumb police man. You go to bed with him.We're in love. We just want to be together. What's wrong with that?They snuck me down the laundry chute and left a paper-mach\u00e9 dummy in my bed.Not this time. He can't keep his trap shut. Besides, I'll probably never see him again.\"-- but I'm not going,\" said Barnaby Jack. \"I'm running away tonight for good, and this time I won't get caught.\" Annabelle whispered: \"I'm coming with you.\" Her yellow hair, now brown at the roots, caught up in the wind and danced. Barnaby Jack took Annabelle's hand and pressed something into it the size of a jellybean. \"Hide this in your socks, and be ready at midnight.\"He leapt out the window and landed in the fresh-fallen snow.But we're not married yet.We're in a hurry.Maybe he's right. It could be a mistake.Being married. Sometimes it seems sad to me. It might be better to just go steady permanently.We're sure.We might have to swim for it.I don't know, but if it's too shallow, we'll break our necks, anyway.
