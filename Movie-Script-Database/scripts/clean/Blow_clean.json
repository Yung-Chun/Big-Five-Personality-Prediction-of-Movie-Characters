It just feels right.Yeah. I am.Holy shit, Dulli. What the hell are you doing here?Yeah, but what are you doing out here?This calls for a joint. You want to do the honors?Right on.Stoned?Yeah?Yeah?The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week. Two bags per flight. Twenty-five pounds in each bag.Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.Here's the best part. We can charge five-hundred a pound.It's already been negotiated. It's done. The money is there waiting.Goodness is right. If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek. Fifty-fifty. That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend. In your pocket, free and clear.Barbara and me. No one else.She's a flight attendant. They don't check her bags.It's not enough.The set-up is wrong. We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail. We're getting middled.So, we need to get to the source.He's getting middled, too. And Derek's our partner. What's good for us is good for him.Who speaks Spanish?You guys are such babies. You want to go home, go. Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.We're not gonna get busted.Yes, I am.Very nice. I'll take it.All of it. As much as you've got. A couples thousand pounds. I'll be back in a week with a plane.I don't need a little. I need a lot.What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars? Would that eliminate some of your concerns?It's fine. We're not stealing it. We're borrowing it. And try to look natural. We've got company.Be cool.Alright, pull back the throttle...Not that far, only halfway. You sure you know what you're doing?Actually, I've got some news. That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.So I brought you sixty.Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?Should we buy it?We'll take it.Well, you know. It's um...Yeah, layaway.Honey, your nose!You wanna split?Okay, guys, we're gonna leave. Let's get the check.Are you sure you're okay? You're pale.I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.No, not at all. Sure. You're right. You fly home and get some rest.Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.Promise me that we'll never be like them. I don't want to wind up like that.I had a little problem in Chicago. Something about trying to sell a truckload of dope to an undercover officer. So I applied the three rules of the game under if and when arrested.Rule one: don't fight. A trial will cost you a fortune in lawyer's fees and the jury will chop off your balls and hand them to you on a platter.Rule two: plead not guilty and get bailed out of jail.Your honor, I'd like to say a few words to the court.In all honesty, I don't feel like what I've done is a crime and I think it's illogical and irresponsible for you to sentence me to prison. None of the real criminals of the world ever end up behind bars. I mean, when you think about it, what did I really do? Cross an imaginary line with a bunch of plants? You say that I'm an outlaw, you say that I'm a thief, but where's the Christmas dinner for the people on relief?Baby, you didn't have to come.Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years. I'll serve two.What? You're not going to wait for me?Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.Time is such a funny thing. I look at where I am now, and in here, time inches along. So slow, it hardly seems like it moves. But back then, time went fast.It went too fast.Hi, Mom.Surprised to see me?Mexico.Barbara.Thank you. Have you been getting the money I sent you?Okay, Mom. It's okay. Where's Dad?May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...Just low.Yeah, Dad. I really did. What am I gonna do?You mad at me?Yeah, you are. I can tell by the way you look at me.I know. I'm great at what I do, Dad. I mean, I'm really great.What?I don't want to talk about it.Not really, no.I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.Murder.What do you got there, Diego?What kind of project?I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.Twenty-six months.I've got to get out of here, Diego.What's the other one?Alright, let's open our books.Alright. You're right. I want to get out of this shithole as fast as I can. And I don't want to do this any more than you do. But for me to walk early, some of you have to graduate. You, forget about it. You're hopeless, go to sleep.But the rest of you could get diplomas and get jobs when you're on the outside.We can learn some criminal shit, too. Alright, I'll make you a deal. What if half the time, we learn about George Washington, and the other half, I'll teach you how to smuggle drugs?I was arrested in Chicago with six hundred and sixty pounds of grass. I think that qualifies me.Flew it in from Mexico on a single engine Cessna. Now, do we have a deal or not?Alright, the first thing you need to know about smuggling drugs is that it's easy. The DEA are a bunch of losers. They couldn't find their dicks in a whorehouse. They don't know what the fuck they're doing...I'm tired, Diego. Go to bed.Good night.I would if I could get some sleep.Because I got caught.Because they caught me?I don't know, Diego. I've got a good thing going already. Everybody smokes pot. It's easy. Cocaine is a rich man's drug. It's too expensive.That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.Oh my G-d.Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking Christ.Getting it here is no problem. Trust me. I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply? How much can we get?Four passenger, single engine Cessna.I don't know. A hundred, hundred and fifty. How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?We'll refuel in the Bahamas. I know someone there.Diego Delgado, please?Diego? It's George.Yeah, I'm out.How are we doing?Do we need a plane? How does this work? When do I see you?I can't go anywhere, Diego. I'm on parole. I can't leave the state.I just got released five minutes ago.Good to see you, Diego.Okay.What details? I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.What? Yeah, sure.My clothes, your clothes. What does it matter?What are we doing here, Diego? This guy's a clown. He's talking about clothes.It's a lousy fifteen kilos. I piss fifteen kilos.You're a fucking amateur!When you're carrying drugs across the border, the idea is to remain calm. The way I do it is to think of something pleasant, a fun party, a moment of triumph. A sexual encounter. I actually project myself to that place. Anything to keep your mind off the fact that you're going to jail for a very long time if they find the fifteen kilos of cocaine in your suitcases.Yes.My brother's wedding. Imagine that, huh?Mine.What can I tell you? Different strokes.We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.Excuse me?I see. How much?Gee, Jack, a million each had such a nice ring to it.You good with this?Alright.What's the matter? We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.It is bad. It's chump change. We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border. We're getting screwed.And what happens when these guys stop paying? Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out. Then where are we?What is it, George? Because I have to get home. I've got a parole officer waiting for me.I'm George. Friend of Diego's?I don't know. He sent me. I'm George.Um-hmm.Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.Well, you better get here fast. I'm sitting on...Hi, Mom.I'm sitting on fifty fucking keys. Get your ass up here.What did I tell you?Sell it?Just sell it, Derek.I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.But to the victor belong the spoils.Half a million for you. Half a million for me. One-point-three five for the Colombians.Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?Where do you guys want to count?What plane? We going someplace? Where we headed? You have your money. It's all there. What the fuck is going on?What the fuck is going on? When did you get out of jail?Yeah. Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.Just a friend.Yeah. You do the talking.Actually, it was three.It would be my pleasure.Un sapo?Yes.With all respect, Padrino. Diego is my partner. I do not do business without him.Yes, it is.Yes, sir. As much as you can give me.It's beautiful.What do I think? I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.I want money.Freedom.Yeah, maybe.Sure.Keep them coming.Money.Diego is my brother.Three million. I counted it twice.I'm calling it three.Fuck it. I'm not counting it again.I don't give a shit. Close enough.Where do I put this!?There's no room.We've got to do something about this.Are you comfortable with this?And keep only forty-percent? No thanks.I love it.I give you thirty-million dollars and you give me this little book.You're a lucky man, Diego.I love you too, man.I'll be right back, Diego.Hello.Do I know you?Why are you smiling?I don't know. My name is George.What is your name?Mirtha.My pleasure, Augusto. Diego has told me much about you.Sky's the limit. We're just beginning to tap the market. If it's accepted by actors and musicians, the rest will follow.I think Padroni is happy with the current situation. Will you please excuse me?I like fire.Jesus Christ.Put that shit away, they're here.It's a family heirloom.Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.So, business is going good. I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable. With my investments...Dad.Yeah, Dad. I'm happy right now.Shut up, Diego. They're going to be here any minute. I'm trying to concentrate.What do you need my connection for, Diego? What are you going to do with it?Jesus fucking Christ, Diego. I ain't telling you. It's just business. Now, shut up. You're driving me crazy.No no no... no problema, amigo. El dinero esta todo aqui. Lleves las \"llaves\" y mas tarde lo contaremos. Okay? No problem.Nothing. Todo esta bien.This is not the time, Diego.Fuck you...I didn't fuck you.Esta todo aqui, amigo...take the keys. Take 'em and go.Take it easy! Everything's okay!Take the fucking keys!Estoy bien, okay? Everything is alright. There's no problem. Okay? This never happened. No one has to know anything about this. Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is. Do it now.No problem, gentlemen. Goodbye.Derek Foreal.Derek Foreal. Derek Foreal. Derek fucking Foreal. Alright? The answer to all your dreams. Are you happy now?Yeah, well where is he? And who is this Norman K. guy? That's all anyone is talking about. Norman K. Norman K. Do I know him?What?Motherfucker works fast.He what?That's impossible. We can't be up and running. Who's distributing?Oh, no.Hello, Derek? This is George. Am I wearing lipstick? I said, am I wearing lipstick? Because when I'm getting fucked, I want to make sure my face is pretty. You're buying directly from Diego, aren't you, you son of a bitch?Yeah. I understand. Just business. Right. Fuck you.I bring you in, and this is how you repay me? You little homo! Hey, Derek? Derek?No, no, no, no yo puedo arregarlo solo.No more brothers, Diego.You fucked me, Diego.You went behind my back and you cut me out.I talked to Foreal, Diego.You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man.Yeah, well...Yeah.I didn't come here to drink scotch.You know why I'm here. You know what I have to do. I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo. This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.You're saying life will take care of Diego?I get it. I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay. For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!Yeah, well, what are you gonna do? You and me, Pablo? Are we good?Shhh, honey, never mind. It's alright. It's over. I quit the business. I'm out.Pablo said no. It's all over. And I'm never going back. I have you. We have the baby. And there's nothing else. It's just the family now. Shhh. Sleep now.Coming!Watching my baby girl born did something to me. They talk about religious experiences, I didn't believe in religion. But when Kristina Sunshine Jung came into this world, something in me changed. I looked at her and I knew right then that I could never love anything but my daughter ever again. It sounds sappy, but it was like, click, I knew what I was put on this planet for. It was the greatest feeling I ever had followed by the worst feeling I ever had.Coke.I don't know. Maybe eighteen grams.Today.Come on. Come on, honey. You can do it. Come to Daddy.Good girl!Look, Mirtha. She's walking.No. These are her first steps. Watch her.But this is...Alright.Where are you going?Yeah. She told me.I heard.It's in the past. I'm out of the business now, so forget about it. No hard feelings. We need to move on. And besides, I'm sorry, too.For calling you a homo.Good to see you, Derek.I know. She needs to slow down. She's going to blow an O-ring.No, that's alright.No honey, I'm alright.What's this?I want my kid out of protective custody. Now. No fucking around. My wife and my kid on a plane tonight. I sign when they call me safe and sound.Fuck you, then. I sign nothing.Oh hey, one more thing?Get me a six pack.Fuck.Hi.Mom.Yeah. Listen. I'm going to be going away for awhile.No.Give this to Mom, will you?Give it to her, Dad. It'll make her happy.Tell Mom, you know...I'd like to make a withdrawal.Please, Mirtha. I'll start working for Augusto. I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.Not in front of the kid.Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.I don't know.No, never. Don't even think about that, it's impossible. I love your mother. And you are my heart. Could I live without my heart? Could I?There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.Hey, why don't you just put a \"I'm doing cocaine\" sign on the car. What is your fucking problem?What?Those are my nuts!What do you want me to say? I'm in prison. You should know. You put me here.My baby. She's so big.Hello, Derek? It's George. Yeah. Yeah, I am. I'm in Miami. I'm looking to do something. I want to put together a crew. Do you know anybody? Leon? I don't know him. What's his last name? Alright. Give me the number.Nothing. I just wanted you to know I was out. I just wanted to see you.How are you doing?Dad.You can call me Dad if you want.Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry. I'm going to make this right. I've got a few things going on...Just to walk with you. I want to be your dad again.Who's the co-pilot?Sounds fine. I'll need to meet everybody.Holy shit, Dulli!That was it. Seeing Dulli after fourteen years sealed the deal for me. The rest was just details. My end was roughly five-hundred thousand. Kristina and I could have a good life for five hundred grand. Start over somewhere. One final score. That's all I needed.No. I have the space. I figured it out. This is what I want to do.Five-thousand per kilo.This is a one time thing, Gusto. One and I'm out. Give me a good price for old time's sake. What do you think?Let me ask you something. If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?Yeah, sure, whatever.California? You can go anywhere in the world. India. Tibet. Australia. Paris. And you choose California?What is it? A Disneyland thing?California, huh?Go on inside now. I want to talk to your mom alone.I'll be here.You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?Yeah, so I've been thinking. I love her, y'know? I kind of want to have her. I've been away for so long. Make up for the missed time, you know?Yeah, well. I'm working on that. I've got something going.Yeah, you will. Of course.Yeah.I know. Well, that's all I really wanted to say. So, okay, then.Yeah. I'm fine. I'm good.Where are you coming in?No. All set. Piece of cake.I'm thinking about getting out of town this week. You want to come with me?I don't know. Maybe California.Yeah. Go out there, check it out, see what it's like. I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday. Thursday after school.You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.There's schools in California.That's right. Three o'clock. Thursday. At your mother's. You and me. It's a date.I swear. On my life.I swear on your life.Are we good? Yeah, we're good. We're beautiful. We're perfect. This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit. Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.You saved my life, Dulli. You'll never fucking know. All you guys. Everyone just got a raise. Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.I don't give a shit. Split it up. Have a great life. I'm done. I'm out. Starting over. Cheers.Yeah! Unbelievable. Dulli, pour us another round. I gotta hit the head.Dulli, I was just thinking about that time we landed in Mexico. You've gotten a lot better since then, huh pal? Remember that fucking landing strip? Huh?Hey, what's wrong fellas? Why the long faces?No. C'mon, Dulli.Oh, no.I was busted. Set up by the FBI and the DEA. That didn't bother me. Set up by Kevin Dulli and Derek Foreal to save their own asses. That didn't bother me. Sentenced to sixty years at Otisville. That didn't bother me.I had broken a promise. Everything I loved in my life goes away.How's he doing?Right.Hello, Dad...You know, I remember a lifetime ago, I was about three-and-a-half feet tall, weighing all of sixty-pounds, every inch your son......those Saturday mornings going to work with my Dad. We'd climb into that big yellow truck. I used to think it was the biggest truck in the world.I remember how important the job we did was. How if it weren't for us, people would freeze to death. I thought you were the strongest man in the world.Remember those home movies when Mom would dress up like Loretta Young? And the ice creams and the football games? Waino, the Tuna, and the day I left for California only to come home with the FBI chasing me?And that FBI agent, Trout? When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said...That was a good one, Dad. That was really something. Remember that?And that time you told me that money wasn't real? Well, old man, I'm forty two years old. I finally learned what you tried to tell me so many years ago.I finally understand. You're the best, Dad. I just wish I could have done more for you. I wish we had more time.I guess I kind of lost sight of things. \"May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars.\" Love, George.I meant every word of it.Yeah, Dad. I knew that.What do you guys want?What about him?What the fuck? Is he going to walk?I don't think so.No thanks, fellas. You've got the wrong fucking guy. I'm not a rat.Mirtha, what's going on? Everything okay with Kristina?Is she here? Is she coming?Yeah.He wants me to testify? Is that what he's asking me to do?Mirtha, how are you doing?Hey, Arch, you think the judge will let us get a cocktail after this is all over?Thanks, Arch.I'm George Jung. Spelled J-U-N-G.Yes, I do.Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...The first run was fifteen kilos, which we smuggled into Logan Airport in hard shelled suitcases.We wrapped the cocaine in kitchen cabinet paper, and duct tape, that way if there were any dogs in customs...I introduced Diego to a pilot named Jack Stevens, who helped us fly 300 kilos of cocaine per week into the United States via twin-engine Cessnas. Jack would fly into North Carolina, we'd meet him there and drive it down to different distribution points...I never met Pablo Escobar. Diego Delgado was my only connection to cocaine from Colombia...Diego convinced me to keep most of my money in a Panamanian bank. Diego had a close relationship with Manuel Noriega. In exchange for allowing us to keep our money there, we paid him a percentage.There was an 85% chance that if you snorted cocaine between 1977-1984, it was ours. Initially with my LA connections, we invented the marketplace. In 1977, there was no other real competition.The first year we made about 100 million dollars between us. It was an expensive operation. Eventually we built up to three different pilots doing multiple runs per week, connections on both coasts, everything was running smooth. We were like a corporation...he was very anti-government. He talked about revolution, forming his own country or island, he was looking for power as well as money. I was just looking for money.He disliked the United States, thought it was a police state. He hoped that by flooding the country with cocaine, it would disrupt the political system and tear down the morality of the country.Well, yes, Derek Foreal was my connection, I met him back in 1968 when I first moved to Manhattan Beach. It was Foreal's marijuana connections that kicked off our cocaine market.Yes, it was my idea to bring the kilos to Los Angeles. When Diego finally got Derek Foreal's name from me, it was only a matter of months before he'd cut me out.I'm not sure how my relationship with my daughter and ex-wife have anything to do with this trial. I mean we're here to talk about Diego Delgado, aren't we?Yes, I am.No, I cam here out of my own volition.Something about vengance being best served cold.Excuse me?I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole. Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old. That's some fucking deal. I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here. I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.You shouldn't have taken the 30 million, Diego, I was out.I'm sorry, baby. I'm so sorry.I didn't mean to...I fucked up.I love you. I love you so much. You've got to know that. You've got to know.After everything. After everything, the only thing left out of my whole life is you.But I have a visitor.But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.

mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?Your offense? Why are you here?Intriguing. I see. Would you like to know my crime?No?Me, too. Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good. But we are roommates, okay? And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars. For the grand theft auto. Okay? So, now it is your turn. Now you will tell me, okay? You will tell me why you are here?Oh, come on, George. If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.Ah, yes. The murder.Nothing. Just a little project.Never mind. Not for you to worry.You have your intrigues. I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne. In nine months, I am free. How much time do you have?Twenty-six months? For murder? I must be your lawyer.Only two ways I know to leave here early. One is to escape.George? Hey, George? I listen to what you say to the class today about the smuggling. You are a magico, ah?I never believed you were a murderer. I knew. I knew you are a magico. I have seen it in you. It's in your spirit.You like to make the boundaries disappear. It's not only the money, is it, George? The adventure is part of the victory. It's the thrill, ah?In my country, I am a magico. A man with a dream. A man on the rise. To take nothing and make it something, okay? I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish. That is why I am in your country. Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream. Do you have a dream, George?Yes, you have a dream. And maybe you accomplish your dream. But yet you failed. Why?No, my brother.You failed because you had the wrong dream.George? What do you know about cocaine?No, no. That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap. In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo. IN Miami, we sell for sixty.And that's wholesale. Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.Yes. And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.Now do you see what I am saying?Don't worry. We will talk of everything. We have the time. You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.What type of planes do you have?How many kilos can we fit in these planes?Fifteen hundred. We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.Great. I love the Bahamas.Allo?George, hallo! Today is the day, ah? Are you out?Congratulations, brother. I've been waiting for you.Perfect, George. Perfect. Everything is fine down here. Everything is all set up.Slow down, George. Slow down.You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody. Ho ho ho. Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes.But you must. It's the only way.George, are we gonna do this or not?Yes. Look around you. The sun. The water. The women. It's better than Danbury, no? Come on. I have some friends I would like you to meet.Fifteen kilos. Seven and a half in each suitcase. You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.Samsonites. Red. No tags.Gentlemen, please. There is no need to be impolite. Cesar, this will be fine. You have my word. George, Cesar is just being thorough. That's all.Three-hundred kilos it is, then.Has everyone met Inez? This is George. I've told you about him. And this is friend, Jack Stevens.Try to be more respectful, darling. My apologies. But she is mistrustful of Americans. Shall we proceed? Let's hear it again, Mr. Stevens.Please, continue.You will watch what you say. Especially around George. He is my brother and he speaks as good Spanish as you.Okay. That's enough.George. George, come in here.What's the matter, George?A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.I know.That's my George, always thinking.This is only part of the business, George. A very small part. Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you. I must go to Colombia.I need you to go to Miami.George.Bad news, George. I'm in Colombia.It's a little hard to get away right now. I'm afraid you're on your own.Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?Thirty-six hours. I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.Touche.George, good to see you, my brother.Pablo used his influence. Now, George, watch what you say. Everybody hears everything. A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America. Life is cheap here, you know? No offense, but you know what I'm saying?Right. Now who is the person in California? The connection?Who? I need to know. Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.There must be some kind of mistake.It's alright, George. You go.Padrino.It's two-point-five, George. I am sure.We're half a million off.Weight it. If it's sixty pounds, it's three. If it's fifty, it's two-point five.Try the back bedroom.Try the closet.George, we've got sixty-one million dollars. It's either here or someplace else. We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.Then relax. It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government. And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles. No questions. No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino. What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar. Who is going to fuck with us?I'm married, George. Me. I can't believe it. Can you believe I'm married, George?I love you, my brother, do you know that?Great, baby, great!Ah, George's mystery man.You don't meet him. George keeps this a secret. He's here meeting everyone, goes to Colombia and meets Pablo, but still keeps his secrets. Even from his brother.Three years. How long have we been in business? Three years. Does she get to meet your connection? Was she good enough?I'm very angry with you, George. Very angry. You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife? A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this. You and me.What do I do with it? Nothing. It's for peace of mind. It's for the principle.I'm driving you crazy? No. You're driving me crazy. We had a dream. What happened to our dream?You embarrassed me, George. You make me look very bad.Everything is not alright. I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!You fucked me in front of my whole family!Sientese ye no se meta en lo que no le importa.Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.What?Where's Diego?George, I am happy to see you. How are you, my brother?Of course we are brothers. Why do you say that? You hurt me, George.I did not.No, I never. I would not do that, George. Never.Maybe you are right. I did betray you a little bit.Oh, boo hoo, boo hoo. So sad, George. I stole your California connection. So what? Who introduced you to Pablo Escobar? Me. Who introduced you to your fucking Colombian wife? Me. Who protected you when my friend Cesar Roza wanted to slice your fucking throat, huh? Who mad you millions and millions of dollars? Me. And what do I get in return? This? Accusations? I have always given you everything, George, but that is over now. This is my operation. My dream. So go home, George. Go back to your stupid little life. You can sell half grams to your fucking relatives for all I care. Because you are out!George, don't be so emotional. This is business.
