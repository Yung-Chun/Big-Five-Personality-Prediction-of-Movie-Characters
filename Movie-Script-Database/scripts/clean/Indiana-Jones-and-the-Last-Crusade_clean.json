Irene, put everyone's name on a list, in the order they arrived, and I'll see each and every one of them in turn.\"Venice, Italy.\"I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid- Twelfth Century, I should think.Where did this come from?\"... who drinks the water I shall give him, says the Lord, will have a spring inside him welling up for eternal life. Let them bring me to your holy mountain in the place where you dwell.Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon, to the Temple where the cup that\u0097\"\"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever. \"The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.An old man's dream.Grail lore is his hobby. He's a teacher of Medieval Literature. The one the students hope they don't get.What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a\u0097to a Franciscan friar, I think.That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.Yes?You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?Dad? He's an academic A bookworm. He's not a field mansDad? Dad?I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!Dad?Mail! That's it, Marcus!Venice, Italy!It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?Do you believe, Marcus?Do you believe the Grail actually exists?Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.Ah, Venice...I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.Yes?And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!Fraulein\u0097will you permit me?I usually don't either.It would make me very happy.Tomorrow I'll steal you another.Roman numerals.That doesn't look much like a library.Marcus\u0097I've seen this window before.Right here. In Dad's Diary. You see?Dad was onto something here!My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.Dad wasn't looking for a book about the Knight's Tomb... he was looking for the Tomb itselfDon't you get it? The Tomb is somewhere in the library! You said yourself it used to be a church! Look.Three.Three!Seven.Seven... Ten.And ten. Now where's the ten? Look around for the ten.Three, seven and ten.Ten. \"X\" marks the spot.Bingo.Except he's lost, and I'm not.Look after this for me, will you?Come on.Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.That's right. If there's a Knight of the First Crusade entombed down here, that's where we'll find him.The Ark of the Covenant.Pretty sure.Watch out.Petroleum. I could sink a well down here and retire.Give me the lighter.Oh, rats...Come onlCome here.Look. . .It must be one of these...This is itl we found it! Look\u0097 the engraving on the Shield. It's the same as on the Grail Tablets The Shield is the Second Marker!It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!Get back! Back against the wall.Quick! Under it!Air pocket!Don't wander off.I think I've found a way out. Deep breath.Ah, VenicelAre you crazy?! You don't go between them!I said go around!I said don't go between them!Why are you trying to kill us?My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?Where is he? Talk\u0097or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!Then we'll die.This is your last chance.All right! Where's my fatherWho are you?And why were you trying to kill me?I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.How's the head?The Knights of the First Crusade laid siege to the city of Alexandretta for over a year. The entire city was destroyed.The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus\u0097 you remember what the Grail Tablet said. \"Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon.\" But where exactly?Alexandretta. Now we know.Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.I'm going after Dad.Elsa?Elsa?Elsa?Elsa?Mine, too.This.Uh-huh.I didn't know you.At least I let you tag along.Knock it off. You're not mad.No. You like the way I do things.Look, what do you think is going on here? Since I've met you, I've nearly been incinerated, drowned, shot at, and chopped into fish bait. We're caught in the middle of something sinister here. My guess is Dad found out more than he was looking for. And until I'm sure, I'm going to continue to do things the way I think they should be done.Leave me alone. I don't like fast women.Ahh, Venice.What do you know about this place?Don't know. Think of something.And not before time! Did you intend to leave us standing on the doorstep all day? We're drenched!Now look! I've gone and caught a sniffle.Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?How dare he?!Nazis. I hate these guys.This one. I think he's in here.Because it's wired.Don't worry... this is kid's play. I'll be right back.Yes, sirlDon't call me that, please.I came to get you! What do you think?And the head. You hit me, Dad!Don't worry\u0097I'm fine.No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.Dad, they come in through the doors.I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.Right.Found it.Well, what was left of him.Alexandretta.No, Dad. You did. Forty years.There were rats, Dad.Yeah. big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?Yeah?Yeah. . .Well, uh...Look, can we discuss this later?Will you take it easy....!I came here to save you.I told you----don't call me Junior!Elsa? Elsa?What?!No! Don't Shoot!Wait! WaitlNo, don't be.She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?How did you she was a Nazi?DonovanSo it did.The hell you will. He's got a two-day head-start on you, which is more than he needs. Brody's got friends in every town and village from here to the Sudan. He speaks a dozen languages, knows every local custom. He'll blend in. Disappear. You'll never see him again. With any luck, he's got the Grail already.I'm sorry you think so.Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!Are you kidding?\u0097I made that up! You know Marcus\u0097he got lost once in his own museum!Can you try and reach into my left jacket pocket?My lucky charm.Try and burn through the ropes.Don't get sentimental now Dad\u0097 save it 'til we get out of here.What???All right, movel Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.Dad!Dad!Dad!Head for the fireplace!I think I can get these ropes off.WhoopslListen Dad...

Come onlHa!What?Brody's this way.You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.All right Dad\u0097tell me.What final challenge?Booby traps?But what are they? Can't you remember?Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?What about Marcus?Two selfless martyrs. Jesus ChristlThis is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.Fraulein Doctor. Where is it?Where is it? I want it.My father didn't want it incinerated.Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for\u0097who gives a damn what you think?All I have to do is squeeze.I've got it.

You're old enough to be her fa---er, her grandfather!I was the next man.Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.We didn't talk. We never talked.A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.When?What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.Dad, how can you --?Well... I can't think of anything.What does that mean?They're turning around. They're taking us back to Germany.Well, I thought it would take them a lot longer to figure out the radio was dead. Come on, Dad. Move!Come on, Dad. Come on!Fly--yes.

He seems okay. They've got a tank. Six-pound gun.Dad, we're well out of range.Come on--come on!Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.I'm going after those horses.I don't need camels.No camels!Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?Where's my father?Dad! Dad! Dad!Dad!Dad! Dadl Get it!Dad?Get out of there, Dad!Dad!Hang on, Dad!Sallah! Get DadlI thought you had too, sir.I'm like a bad penny.

The only thing that matters is the Grail.Marcus would agree with me.That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil.
