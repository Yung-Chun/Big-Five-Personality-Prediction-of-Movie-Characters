Billy shines the bright.desk light into the creature's eyes. Mogwai screams and jumps. off the desk, to the floor. Billy looks down at the creature.Stay down there. Billy goes back to his work. Mogwai is-bored. The creature leaps up to the bed.. It sees the sword. Mogwai lifts one end, examining it. It's too heavy. The sword slips off the bed and falls to the floor. Billy turns. Mogwai takes a step back. Guilty. Frightened. Billy picks up the sword. The handle is chipped.You stupid little... Billy raises the sword over.Mogwai. He's ready to kill the tiny creature.

I.just might have a chance with you?Want some?A present from my Dad. Pete picks up the creature and pets it. Pete likes Mogwai.I dunno, Pete...They must only multiply with plain tap water.Huh? Well, yeah. I guess so. Pete grabs one of the creatures, taking it from the group. It cries out. In a high, piercing scream. The other creatures leap at Pete.

Billy squeezes a drop of water on one creature. Mogwa' lets out a scream. A lump appears on the creature's back. The lump gets bigger...bigger...bigger ... Roy watches with wide eyes. Suddenly, another creature bursts from Mogwai's body. NINE IDENTICAL CREATURES now stand on the desk top.(nods, checks hisAnything else?Forget it. Billy stares coldly at his Father. Embarrassed, Rand looks away.Damn things are stuck to the floor. Rand picks up a baseball bat. He raises it over his head and swings down, hard. Against the pod. The bat snaps in two. The pod is unblemished. Rand rubs his stinging hands. Billy and Rand just look at each other. Puzzled.Why did they attack my dog?Screw'science. I want them des- troyed.Dad, they killed Barney.

He grabs his sword and gets out of the car.Tracy!...It's me! Billy!I'll get him out. Billy quickly opens the police car door. He jumps out.He's dead. Tears fill Gary's eyes. Billy leads Gary to the car.C'mon. Just stay in the light. They're afraid of the light. Gary walks. He looks scared. Helpless. They get to the police car. Billy opens the door.We're just outside of town... Doesn't look like the creature's got here yet. Let's go inside and warm up. They exit the police car..and they originate from this marketplace in Hong Kong. Dorrystands and shakes his head.You see...they''re drawn to water. Now, if my hunch is correct... They'll be leaving town, and heading for the water tower-which means they'll have to pass by here tonight. We have to get help. These things have to be kept under control. If they get to the water tower .they could spread all over the St ate... maybe the Country. They're like inhuman divining rods.I did. But nobody would listen.That's not true.That isn't..Yeah, and then I'd like to try and get in touch with my Dad. If we can...They're here. A frightened Gary holds Tracy.Do you have a place without win dows?... .A place where we could be safe? Dorry pauses to think.We have to hurry. Dorry leads everyone.out of the.room...We'll stay ere until daybreak. Gary sits with Tracy on an old sofa. Dorry sits beside them in an\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdold rocking chair.

Instead,\"she walks:over to Billy.sleeping in his chair. His hand still holds the sword on his lap. The others are asleep. Billy's hand quivers. The sword drops to the floor. He wakes. Startled. He quickly grabs the sword. Everyone else wakes from the sound.Everything's okay...I just dropped my sword. Gary rubs his eyes.Try. the phone. .see if we can get help... Dorry walks back inside. Gary flips on a transistor radio that has been sitting on the shelf.Damn.How? The nearest town is fifteen miles away.In this? You won't get far.And-what happens when it gets dark? ...And you're on the road. Alone. Gary says nothing.No. We have to stick together and fight these things. At least until we can get help... Tracy folds her arms.Okay. We 11 get something to eat. , Them we go 1 to wJork.It's.possible. But it's more important to get at the creatures. We've got the advantage now. It's daylight.No...But they're all gathered in one place. And the sun rose before they could make it to the water tower. So they must be holed up between here and there.Too many windows. Too much light. it's got to be someplace dark. Totally dark.No. There's too many of them.. They'd need a huge area...You used to work here, right?You're coming in with me., You can show me around.Blow up the theater. Everyone seems puzzled. Billy turns to Gary.This place has some kind of boiler room...with a furnace... right?I'll use the gas lines as a bomb. The fire will destroy the creatures. Dorry looks at Billy.Okay...just remember;.We've got to stick together. And keep close to the flashlight. They're scared of the light. Everyone nods. Gary turns on the flashlight. Tracy takes Billy's hand. Gary is jealous. They enter the theater.They're inside the theater. The others peer into the window.How do we get to the boiler room?Damn. There's too many of those things. They'll- see us.Give me your T-shirt. Gary reluctantly takes. off his T-shirt. Billy ties the two shirts together. He winds them into a cord. He finds a connection in the gas line. He begins to pound against it with the handle of his sword. The. sounds of metal ring out.We have to get out. Fast. Gary points to a rear exit.Not your gun. There's too many. Use the light. Gary stops shooting and fumbles for his flashlight. A creature leaps atDorry, pinning the old man to the ground. Other creatures attack Dorry. Biting. Scratching. Tearing. Billy picks up his sword and begins to knock the creatures off Dorry. Creatures come at Tracy. She picks up a section of thick lead pipe and bats off the oncoming Mogwai. Gary finally turns on the flashlight beam. It keeps some of the Mogwai at bay. Fire creeps up the T-shirt, getting closer to the gas line. Billy gets all-the creatures off Dorry. More creatures come through the door. Gary gets scared. He drops the flashlight and runs for the rear exit.Get back here! We need you! .Gary runs out, leaving the others alone. Billy and Tracy continue to fight the creatures.Let's go. Billy picks up Dorry's body. Tracy protects him by batting away any oncoming creatures. They hurry out of the boiler room.You bastard. You ran out on us. Left us alone. To die. Billy drops his sword and jumps Gary. They fall to the ground. Fighting. Punching.Wait... He looks out the rear window.looks at the creature on the back seat. It still cries out in that high pitched scream.Hear that? He's calling his friends for help. They're following us. As long as he's alive and screaming... they'll come after him.We can't kill him. He's our bait. We'll be able to lead them away from the water tower. Just keep an eye on the thing... make s re it doe n' hurt us. Tracy keeps the swo d on the cre ture. Billy guns the engine and screeches off. He looks to the rearview mirror.We'd better hurry.

Tracyhurries to the garage.grabs the creature. Mogwai is still wounded and dazed. But it manages to bite and scratch at Billy. Tracy holds the tool box open. Billy forces Mogwai inside. He closes the tool box and locks it shut. Mogwai is trapped inside. The creature pounds against the metal. Its loud cry echoes from inside. Billy checks the car's engine.Damn! He ripped out the coil wires! The car won't run without them!There's no time. (grabs herHe lies in bed. His wounds are bandaged. An I.V. needle is in his arm.How's Tracy?Oh my God!
