Istanbul?You mean you got toilets?For the money... )I know.Dad get me out of here.Okay.What'd the Prosecutor say?Did you ask for bail?DAD!Everything is \"sula-bula\" which means \"like this, like that\" - you never know what will happen. One day one of the new kids was raped in the children's kogus, so they picked out six of the worst kids...What is it with you man, what the hell is it?You're ayip!But you fuck with me.

Mom?What do you mean?And?What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!I HAVE FIFTY THREE DAYS LEFT!I HAVE FIFTY THREE DAYS LEFT!...What is the crime? And what is the punishment? The answer seems to vary from place to place, and from time to time. What's legal today is suddenly illegal tomorrow cause some society says it's so; and what's illegal yesterday all of a sudden gets legal today because everybody's doing it and you can't throw everybody in jail. Well I'm not saying this is right or wrong. It's just the way things are....But I spent the last three and a half years of my life in your prison and I think I paid for my error and if it's your decision today to sentence me to more years, I...And I've been playing it cool and I've been good and now I'm damn tired of being good cause you people gave me the belief that I had 53 days left. You hung 53 days in front of my eyes and then you took those 53 days away, and Mister Prosecutor! I just wish you could...... stand right here where I'm standing and feel what that... ...feels like, cause then you'd know something you don't know you'd know what means, Mister Prosecutor and you'd know the concept of a society is based on the quality of its mercy means, of its sense of fair play, its sense of justice... but I guess that's just like asking a bear to shit in a toilet...For a nation of pigs, it's funny you don't eat them.

There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead. We're sitting right on top of it -- here.The Kraut said there's a whole bunch of hollow sealed shafts sort of like dumbwaiters running along this wall; one of them is right in there, right next to our shower. We get in there, he says, we can get down into the catacombs. With three of us working....Stop shitting me, man!Hey! I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip! We go through the wall....The Kraut was right! I checked it out - there's no reinforced steel in those bath walls. They're real soft from underground seepage----the water like \"'weeps\" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.The catacoombs? Whaddya want, a door?
