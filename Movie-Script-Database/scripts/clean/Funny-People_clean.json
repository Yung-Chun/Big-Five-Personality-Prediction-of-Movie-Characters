{"Funny-People": {"GEORGE": {"raw_line": "Hey, it's George Simmons, I'm coming in.Sure buddy. Let's do it. One of the college students put his arm around George while the other takes the picture.Yeah bud. They take the picture.Thanks. Tell your friends.I like those lunestas. They really put me to sleep without giving me the sleeping pill hangover I get from the restorils.Yeah, sure. She puts her arm around him. Her little brother jumps in too.Thanks, pal.I don't understand what this means.Ah life. What does it mean? sometimes life makes perfect sense. And then you `come'.Life isn't all about laughs. Crazy shit happens. You've got to be nice to each other. You never know what's going to happen. Ira passes George as he heads onto the stage.Sorry I sucked it up out there. At least they are well rested for you. Ira, takes the stage. He starts trying to do his act, but he is unsure of himself and unable to figure out how to take the weird energy of the room and spin it to his advantage. He basically bombs. We reveal Chuck and his date watching, looking miserable.Oh I'm sorry. Let me pull out. George pulls the car back ten feet.Hey man, you had some funny shit tonight.Man, that audience hated you. They really did not like you. They liked your buddy, who looked exactly like you but was funnier. Man, that's going to haunt you. You're going to wake up in six months and think about this night.I'm just fucking with you. You had some funny jokes in there. Good writing.Alright, pal. Don't worry. Only two hundred people saw that tonight. I'll see you later. George pulls out, turns the car around, and as he passes by Ira, he steers his car as if he's going to run him down, and starts screaming...You're gonna die!!! I'm gonna kill you! Then he smiles at Ira and drives off. Ira smiles. This is the greatest thing that's ever happened to him.Hey, is this Ira?It's George.I thought you and Leo were pretty funny last night and I have to do this corporate gig for Apple computers in a couple of days and I thought you guys could write me some jokes.I don't know, about computers and shit. I could mainly do my act but they like it if you talk about them a little.What is your email? I will send you my fax and email and all that.I almost just changed my mind. You got to change that.Today. Seriously. Ok. Later. Ira hangs up and turns to his friends.There's some funny shit in here. Not a bad ratio of good jokes to shit.Too many choices. I don't like reading that much. I need like ten good jokes. I'm a little mad you made me read that many to get to ten. But thanks for doing it.So you cried yourself to sleep?I'm leaving at four tomorrow to go to the gig. You want to come check it out, see if your shit works?How you doing, you ready for this?I think I'm going to have you go on before me to warn them up.Hey, if you bomb, they'll just be more excited to see me. They'll be so glad your not on stage any more. Then if you do well, they'll be ready for me. Either way, you're helpful.I like this joke about watching porn and making porn all at the same time. That was a good one.You want something to eat? I had them bring Chinese on the plane. Ira's eyes widen. He likes this way of life.And just say he's a friend of mine, and I think he's funny.What the fuck is that? You did three of the jokes that you wrote for me.That's why I hired you, to write jokes about computers. Ira takes out the long list of jokes he's written.They better kill, I'm getting paid a hundred thousand dollars for this.We'll be on the ground in a half hour. Want to go to a bar? Do something fun?Here's a grand for the jokes and the gig. Even though you should be paying me after that. Ira's eyes widen.Good job.Then this is an exciting moment.I feel nothing. I remember when a grand was the most exciting thing in the world. I'd go to Red Lobster and go nuts. Now it's just numbers in a bank account. Enjoy tonight. You made a thousand bucks.Hey, let's all go back to my house.Oh there's a whole other wing that you wouldn't even know existed unless you went through this door.He can't believe he's having sex with you.Hey, Mandy thought you left, so she left.Sorry, that kind of stuff happens when you have a big house.You don't have to go. I'm just saying that she left. I think she left her purse in the other wing. Come with me, let's go get it. Ira watches this, astonished.Yeah, I got Galaga. Let's go check it out.Hey don't go, I'll be back in a second.That girl left. You want to talk to me while I try to go to sleep. Ira doesn't know what to make of this.I'm afraid I did. I'm sorry. It was just so clear that you were not going to get it done. I figured you wouldn't mind.It was great. It was crazy great.Well, we took a steam shower together.she had never seen a steam shower before, I told her she should enjoy it.She told me that too, but she says I was on her and her boyfriend's list of people she was allowed to screw. You'd be surprised how many women have me on that list.Just talk to me before I fall asleep. I'm weird. I don't like being alone. You should crash in one of the rooms. You're too drunk to drive home. I won't try to fuck you, I just fucked two women and I'm kind of done.Whack away, I don't give a shit.I do feel bad for you, because no matter how hard you try, you'll never be as funny as me.Did your dad crack you on the head when you were a kid?That's why. My dad always seemed annoyed with me. He'd always crack me on the head. You would not see it coming. I spent my whole childhood trying to make my dad laugh so he wouldn't smack me. But he was an awesome guy. He was the coolest. He just got annoyed with me. Do you like your parents? They can't be that bad, because you're not that funny.No, keep going. It's interesting. Tell me about your day job?Hey man, you want to make me breakfast?Do you know how to cook anything?Okay, let's have some eggs. While Ira is cooking, George takes a lot of pills.No. Medicine. I'm sick.I've got some crazy blood disease. They think I'm going to die in six months to a year. Some weird thing, almost nobody has it. All these are experimental.No, I'm telling you the truth.I haven't told anybody yet. I don't think I'm going to.Well it's easier with you because I don't know you. I don't feel weird around you. I don't want to be treated like a guy who's going to die.Actually, the reason why I only told you is I need you to do me a favor.I can't imagine suffering through the final stages of this. So...I was going to ask you if you would be willing...to euthanize me.Kill me. I figured if I found someone that nobody knew that was a stranger, they could get away with it, and I wouldn't have to suffer. I got a gun that is untraceable. And a silencer. And I thought maybe tonight, I would take a bunch of sleeping pills, and when I slept you would put a bullet in my head.I'll give you fifty thousand dollars in cash. You'd be doing me a favor. It would be the kindest thing you could ever do for somebody.Holy shit, you would do it. You were literally thinking about doing it!I'm an asshole, you were about to kill me. For fifty grand! That's not even a lot of money.You basically just told me that you were willing to be a murderer. While you're cooking me eggs.Well, I actually am sick. And I'm not going to survive.I'm not putting you on, man. Just don't tell anyone. I mean that. I don't want people to know about this. I don't want to feel weird. Ira nods okay.Do you really think I'm going to sit here and have a theological conversation with you?Maybe later, Father Mulcahy.Hey. You want to see if we can get on-stage somewhere?I was thinking about it. I could throw you some money every week for coming up with new jokes for me. Maybe you can organize them in the computer, keep track of what I'm doing.I'll throw you $1500 a week.I'm just doing stand-up to have fun, forget about it on stage. There's nothing funny about that.Fuck classic stuff. Idon't give a shit what people think of my shit when I'm dead. Why don't you wait till you're about to die and then you do a bit about it? I'll bet you're about-to-die shit will be funnier than my about-to-die shit.I ordered your Roast Beef. And normally it's delicious. But this time I paid a price!Well that's very nice of you. But I have one question for you. Can I get two sandwiches? George motions for Ira to do something.This is a family matter! He can hit me if he wants. He's my grandson, and I love him! Now may I give you my name, so you have it on file so I can get my free sandwich? K-A-C-A-H-A-K-R-E-K-K-U- C-T-A-R-S-U-T-A-R-G-M-S. Did you get that? Can you say it back to me?No, I had a bad night last night. I was sweating though the sheets, couldn't stop. So I got up, watched half of a season of The Wire and then I slept till...what time is it now?I wanted to get up and do something. But I don't think I have it in me. I may just go back to bed.Yeah, I need all sorts of things. But nothing you can get me. You should go up anyway. You were in a groove the other night, you don't want to get rusty.Really? How long you gonna keep that job for? I'm paying you good money. What if someone you perform in front of goes into Ralph's and sees you cutting turkey?I wasn't like you. I had a different theory. You've got to spend money to make money. Nothing makes you work harder than being in debt. Maybe we should go buy a Corvette. That'll make you try to be funnier.(speaking like an oldI don't know! The thief has the card, why don't you ask the thief the number of the card! George hangs up the phone. He starts dialing.Ah yes, I came into your comedy club tonight and I was very offended by the performer. I did not pay good money to have the so- called \"comedian\" shake my wife's hand, then smell it and say, \"Did you have fish for dinner?\" That is not my idea of entertainment. Ira leaves the room, feeling like he's intruded on a private moment.No, no. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 don't want to do that.I don't want to do anything. I just want to be in the moment and live every day the best I can. As soon as I confront it with everybody, everything's changed and I can't get back.P4y parents would drop dead if I told them what was happening. They're in their 80s. They don't have to go through this. I'll make sure they find out at the last possible second.I don't think I do. I thought I did. I got a lot of people I know, shoot the shit with, fuck around with. But I realized when this happened I'm not close to anyone. I had no one to call. My friendships are Hollywood friendships. When I was lying in bed I couldn't think of one person I wanted to share this with. Maybe it's me, maybe I never got close to anybody.The only reason I did that was because I couldn't sleep. And I had no one to call.(his eyes begin to wellSeriously. I can't...I can't have you do that. George really begins to cry.Please don't do that.Okay, as long as we got that straight. George takes a napkin and puts it over his face.(his face still in theI'd rather drop dead. of a heart attack and have someone else make the calls. I have to make those calls? This is a nightmare. This is a total nightmare.Yeah.So I left the phone off the hook so he could hear me doing it.Admit it, you were masturbating.And I kept making her talk and say crazy shit just to make him laugh.I will tell them, but right at the end. I don't want them to go through all this. I can't put them through this.I wish I was a better brother.You live so far away. I visited you in Kansas a few years ago.Thanks a lot, pal. This is everything I didn't want to happen. It's like being at my own funeral.No, I won't.Well, I really appreciate you coming by.Exactly. Well, I really need to rest...It was so good to see you. George stands up and exits the room. Ira walks over.I guess so, but...This is awful. Awful. I hate you for having me do this.Well what are we going to do when it's over, when we're done tomorrow? Because then I'm not talking to anyone.Thanks for coming down. You didn't have to do that, i appreciate it.I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for everything I did to you.I screwed everything up. I could have been married to you now.We could've had a family . I don't have a family, I'm all alone here.You know, maybe I deserve it. I screwed up the only good thing that ever happened in my life. I cheated on you. For no reason at all. Just young and stupid. And selfish. I'm sorry.Yes you did. ANGLE ON: Ira sneaking a peak from the kitchen as he makes coffee.Did you leave him?See, that was my mistake. I should have had some kids with you before I cheated. she laughs.Me too. They cry, forehead to forehead.I'm so sorry. I really loved you. And I do love you.Don't set me up for jokes like that. You're ruining the moment. She smiles. They hug.You know, I never got married. I never had kids. I didn't get to do a lot of things I thought I would do. But I was pretty fucking funny, right?Well, I made a lot of people laugh. I guess that's something.Yeah. I guess so. They watch some more and we see a really happy, young George getting big laughs with something really silly.Look at that crazy motherfucker.I never understood why people hiked before. I think I get it now.I'm feeling good, so I'm going to the doctor.No, I'm feeling good. It's kind of weirding me out.I don't feel sick at all, and it's scaring me. I feel like I'm just going to drop dead. Am I not going to feel bad at all, and then one day wake up dead? It's disconcerting.Well what the fuck do I do now?I really want to thank you for your help through this time.Well, you didn't have to, and you were really there for me. I was thinking, maybe we should write a movie together.I feel like I've learned a lot, and I wanna use this good place I'm in right now to do something really creative. I would pay you, certainly. I make, you know, about a million dollars to write a script. I can't give you half, but maybe one hundred, two hundred grand, but we'll figure it out.I thought a lot about my work when I was sick and I'm in sort of a strange place career-wise, because I'm normally the goofy, funny guy and I don't know if people are expecting a change from me. And I think people are expecting me to evolve, and it's important to evolve before they make a point of asking me why I'm not evolving.Is that something they taught you at the deli. I'm not asking you for your advice, I just though we could start trying to come up with an idea.It's very strange. It's gonna take me a few days to process it, but it's a gift and I'm going to treat it that way.I learned a lot from being sick and it's gonna help me make some good choices, and be a good person from now on.It's weird, I feel like the old guy in the room. When I started out I was always the young guy. It's strange how fast you become the old guy. And I feel exactly the same.I know you, I've watched your show. \"'Nuff Said.\" It's a good show.No, it's good, it's cute. I like it.Don't be ashamed, it's good. But what about that girl on the show? How old is she? Tell me she's 25.Holy shit! I feel bad. I don't want to tell you what I did watching that show. Are you serious? She's 15?Okay, good. Now I don't feel so bad. Their weird friend, FUTORAN, pipes up.It's kinda like 9/11. You know after 9/11 you kind of liked everybody? But then it went away. It's like that.I don't believe in any of that stuff, but I was hoping I was headed somewhere. I felt like I was.Well, it's easy to think that way until you're headed for the dirt. Then your mind opens up a little bit, you know? Maybe it's desperation, or maybe you just start to see more of the big plan. Luckily I got a little more time before I find out. Daisy pops her head into the room.May I say the prayer? Everyone nods yes.Everyone hold hands. Thank you for the gifts this year. Thank you for And thank you for And hopefully next year I'll get to screw that girl on Mark's show. All our dreams will come true. You guys will get an apartment with less pubic hair on the toilet seat, you'll be able to afford a maid. Maybe next year you guys can get a better celebrity than me. Maybe Wolf Blitzer will come. I also pray that no one put their balls on this turkey, I'm kind of scared you guys are about to give me salmonella poisoning. I know this Orphan's Thanksgiving it's just a normal Thanksgiving for you guys, but it's a very special one for me. I'm very glad to be here. I'm not that glad to be here with you, but I thank you for having me. I'm sure it will be very memorable for you. Now let's find out what Leo's balls taste like.This guy wrote me some funny jokes for that Mac gig. I asked for some jokes and he sent me about a hundred. Seriously. This guy sent me jack shit. If you want to succeed you need a work ethic like Ira over here.Sure I did. I asked you and Ira to write me jokes and you flaked. Leo's eyes widen with anger.Ira wrote this joke about Leopard, it was really funny. Do the joke, Ira.It was like, what's great about. Leopard is you can watch a porno, write a porno, shoot a porno, and order a porno all at the same time. This guy's fucking funny. Leo jumps up suddenly and walks out of the room without saying anything. Ira watches him go, concerned.You guys look like a cute couple, you should go out.If I didn't go out with every girl one of my friends slept with... let me put it another way. If none of my friends went out with girls I went out with, none of them would have gotten laid.You guys are young, why are you taking everything so seriously? As someone who's been through a lot recently, let me tell you something. The worst thing you can do is hold grudges and be judgmental. Everyone's making mistakes, everyone's screwing up. You guys are cute together. George points at Mark.I know that Mark's not good in bed. Don't tell me he was a good lay. He can't have a big dick. Look at Ira. He's thick. He's gotta have a thick dick.See? She's funny. She can take a joke, she's not sensitive. I think I'm falling in love with both of you.I'm gonna walk away now, causing an awkward moment, that will be followed by a true moment, filled with chemistry. I'm walking away now. Let the awkwardness begin. George walks out of the room.I didn't know you were fucking over your friend. Don't yell at me.He kicked you out for that.Well in a way that's a compliment to me because he's so mad he can't hang out with me that's he mad at you. That's kind of cool. I got you kicked out.This should be comfortable in here. This room is almost as big as your old apartment.No problem. Hey, you want to come talk to me while I crash?All right, Charlie. Talk to me. George closes his eyes.I was thinking that now might be a good time for me to make that script \"Making Amends.\"I got money. I want to challenge myself. You said you liked it.I thought they did well overseas.What if I do it for no money, just with back-end?I'vedone four Davey movies.They wantme to do another sequelto that?We don't even have ascript.Could I at least shoot the Making Amends movie first?Maybe I'll just write something myself.There's nothing funny about being smart. All comedy comes from immaturity. Buster Keaton, Jerry Lewis, the Marx Brothers, WC Fields, Bill Murray, Steve Martin, Charlie Chaplin. They were all immature. They were all knuckleheads. Who wants to see a smart guy live his life normally? What's funny about that? What else you got?I'm thinking about taking a gig, and having a solid hit before getting into breaking new ground.Yeah, if we can come up with an idea.I can't. I've got a date.This woman my agent set me up with. She raises money for this environmental group. I guess she's like a normal person. I can't live here alone in this house forever. I need something of significance in my life. So I'm gonna go out on some dates. No pressure.Why would you say that?That's insulting. Don't take out your frustrations on me because you can't get laid by acting like I'm some sort of deviant. I'm an adult. I have adult sexual relationships. No one does what they don't want to do. Sex is how people decide if they like each other. I'm testing my compatibility by ass-raping them.That's not true. I'm bored of sex, anyway. There is literally no body- part/orifice combination I haven't experimented with. There is nothing left to do. There is no nationalities I haven't.slept with, no age groups I haven't slept with. I'm fully ready for normal.US. Canada. Mexico. England. France. Spain. North Korea. Burma. Rwanda. Kenya. Tibet. Serbia. Chechnya. Iran. The Green Zone. Darfur. The Killing Fields of Cambodia. Mongolia. What about you?You know, I haven't been out on a blind date, ever. This may be the first one.What's J Date?So it's just a list of all the Jewish people? I thought we didn't liked to be tracked and monitored like that. She looks at him, doesn't get the joke.You know, because of the... holocaust.What if you don't like Jews? She just stares at him.I'm joking. So, uh, I hear you raise uh money for an environmental group. That must be very satisfying.See? That's why I still drive a big truck. I stop driving that truck and that factory shuts down.You know what they say about people with a big carbon footprint? Big dick.Come on. We're gonna go do a gig tonight. Up north. And you're gonna open up for me.I think two thousand.Twenty minutes. Thirty, if you can get there.Dress nice. Tickets are expensive.Its near San Francisco.It's not that far. It's like two more movies.I'd sit up front but the DVD player is back here.No. I'm near-sighted. I'll miss the exit. We Lear an EXPLOSION from the movie.Holy shit!The monster showed himself.Hey, you made it.You remember Ira.I'm hanging in there.Me too.Now I have no jokes. Ira, you have to do an hour and half. She laughs.Come by after and give me the review.I need you to do something for me. After your set I gave you a seat right next to her. During the intermission I want yQ.u to tell her I'm not sick anymore.Because it's weird, and emotional. I think she'll handle it better if it comes from somebody else. And then I can talk to her about it afterwards.She'll be happy. It's not weird. You're the bearer of good news.Thanks. A lot has happened. And at least I got some good jokes out of it.Ira and I are driving out of town tomorrow, I thought maybe we could stop by your place on our way out. I want to see what the ranch looks like, and meet your husband.Okay. We'll come by in the morning.Here's your money for tonight. Good job.What's the fun in that? You can go pay for your own room, I don't care.I was young, stupid... and I liked fucking girls. Why do you think I cheated? You would do it too if anyone would fuck you.Two or three times ...a week ...for a couple of years.It was awful. There was even marriage talk. My parents didn't want me to do it because she wasn't Jewish. She was taking classes to convert, even. I mean, how cool is that? She was changing religions to be with me. She knew more about being a Jew than I did from those classes. She was so cute when she spoke Hebrew, it sounded so wrong. George says the Jewish grand prayer with a waspy accent.And then one day, somebody told her, I don't know who. And that was that.I like her. I love her. I miss her. I just want to spend a little time with her. I know nothing will come of it. I just miss being around her. A beat. George starts clicking through Video On--Demand adult movies.Anything looking good to you?okay. You want to watch Juno?Yeah, of course I am. Laura opens the door.This place is beautiful.You have horses?All right, well, we're ready for the big tour. I want to see how you live. Suddenly, Laura's five-year-old daughter INGRID runs into the room and she's pissed.She's very pretty. I like your hair.Okay. I do not like your hair.Oh, really? Do you like them? Which one's your favorite?Sixteen? Just fast-forward past the bad parts.I can't believe I'm saying this, but I agree with Paula. I think you're the one to beat. They all applaud. Ira notices Laura looking at George with admiring eyes that reek of more than friendship.My turn. Get ready to be blown away.What? It's Paradise City, by Guns and Roses.Ira, Laura invited us to stay over for dinner.Don't worry, we'll figure it out. You have something to do in the morning?Then everything will be fine.This town is so small and adorable. It's like out of a Demi Moore movie.it can't be that bad. You live on a pretty little ranch. You have horses, a duck. It must be a nice life.I couldn't believe you moved out of LA. You were getting some good jobs as an actress. You got to play the bitch on Melrose Place for awhile and make out with Andrew Shue. That was pretty good. Do you miss it?How do you go crazy?Oh, that must have gotten ugly. How long did that stay awkward for?Maybe you weren't acting on Melrose Place.well I don't anymore. I haven't cheated on anybody since you. I haven't even been in a committed relationship since you, so it's impossible for me to have cheated.I thought a lot about you when I was sick, and I would do anything for another chance. I know it creates a mess, but I think it would be worth it. I think we both know it's what we should be doing. He kisses her.Why?So? What's wrong with that?Does somebody in your family like sports? They start passionately making out, slamming into the flatscreens.Then let's not do it. She stares at him, trying to figure out what he's become-- is he a good guy or a bad guy?The town is beautiful.Oh. Hello.Well, thank you. You've got a great family and a great home.Sounds like your business is going very well.Uh...I'm hanging in there.I appreciate that.It just makes you appreciate every moment. It brings things into focus, you suddenly realize what's important in life.No, I haven't.You ever see Laura act? She was quite an actress in her day.It's beautiful here at night.We probably should get some rest before the drive. All right, show us to our quarters, sir.I really don't know what to say. I re- ally don't know what to say.We had sex in Clarke's office.Because I love her. She's the best thing that's ever happened to me.She's miserable. He cheated on her.Yeah, but that was a long time ago. I've changed. You saw that douche bag. You don't think he's fucking geishas on every business trip?This is none of your fucking business. Just stay out of it.This shit is deeper than you understand. People get divorced. People make mistakes and then they fix them. That's how life works. It's not a big deal. I know you're still sad because your parents got divorced. Well get the fuck over it. Call a fucking cab and go home.You're gonna sleep in Clarke's office. I'm gonna go talk to Laura.On, there you are. I've been looking for you.Are you smoking a joint?No, that stuff makes me paranoid.What's happening?Not so loud, your kids are sleeping.Oh my god. Really? I mean, this is fun, but I don't know how much I can take. Hopefully they'll take a nap at some point. I want to take a nap.That's great. Are you okay doing that?Sure. If I'm not shooting a movie, or on tour or something, that would be great. Laura leans in and kisses George. George is not big on public displays of affection. He kisses back, but you can tell that he's very uncomfortable. They hear the kids headed back to the table and quickly separate.This is a small bookstore. They've only got one Philip Roth book. Didn't he write like fifty books?She's going to talk to Clarke tonight, and then she's going to make a plan. We've got to get over that hurdle.This is exactly what I wanted.I mean, she's cool, right?She was kind of cooler when I knew her back in the day. She's still hot, but she was crazy hot back then. Her attitude has changed a bit. With the kids and all. Back then she was really sexy, and all about fucking. I know she's busy with her life now, but it is a little different.Well hopefully everything will work out. If it doesn't, it just wasn't meant to be.It means I'm going to give it a shot. I'm excited, but I'm not going to really know if it works until we're in it. I hope I'm just not in love with the person she used to be.There's no way to ever be sure that anything's going to work! I couldn't live up here. She wants me to live up here. I don't think I can do it. Maybe a couple of weeks a year.Do you think she means that she's going to bring the kids too?I don't know, don't some men get custody of the kids? Or they split the custody? I like the kids, but I've never lived with kids before.The young one's kind of cute, but I don't think I can stand the old one full time. There's too much going on there. But I could definitely tolerate the young one. She's cute. Maybe they can split kids. Maybe Clarke will take the annoying one. Ira just stares at him, not sure what to do.Okay, call me if you need any backup.I.. . love you. The car drives off.Okay, I'm going to go into the other room and watch some TV.Nah, I was going to watch four hockey games at once. I've never done that.But you don't smoke.Don't you know how to do it?Where are you, where are you? You have to come back here. I need your help. I don't know how to do this. He walks back to where the kids are. They are watching tv. All around the room are family pictures. He is beginning to feel bad about what is happening.Why would you say that?Laura, it's George. Come back to the house. Maybe you shouldn't do it. Maybe it's too early for this. Call the house.Where are you?You've been gone for forty minutes.Well come back. I don't know how to take care of these kids, I'm not a camp counselor like you. These kids are on to me. The older one's too intense. She's troubled. She's like Damien, from the Omen. I need help.She's not happy. Clarke punches George in the face then kicks him martial arts style.You shouldn't joke about my disease. That was very serious. Very scary. Clarke punches him several times, but they are more like martial arts hits.What the hell is that? Ira arrives. George starts yelling at Ira.Don't jump in. Whatever you do, don't jump in. I don't want your help!You said you were getting cigarettes then you ran to the airport to stop her. What kind of friend are you?I didn't deserve what you did to me. You betrayed me !Don't hit me! I've been sick! They don't know. The medicine is working now, but I'm still sick. Clarke punches George.What are you doing? I said to jump in!That's what \"don't jump in\" means. It means \"jump in.\" Help me! Ira steps in. Clarke hits him hard, then kicks him.You're a terrible fighter.Laura, tell Clarke to stop!Laura, tell him. Tell him you want to be with me now. Laura doesn't answer.Laura?Laura, what's it going to be? Are you going with him, or are you going with me? Laura looks at Clarke.Don't do this.You cheated on her too!She told me I was the love of her life. And she loves me more than she loves you!Yeah!Stop Ira, you're hitting me too. Mable and Ingrid appear outside.We're wrestling. It's fun.No. We were just painting. I got some paint on my cheek.None of you fuckers can hurt me. George pauses, then leaps onto Ira and they roll on the ground for a moment. Ira makes his-way free and gets up.Drive me home.How are you gonna get home then?Oh yeah?What about you? You are just a lackey. Who are you to judge me? You tried to screw me over, after all I. have done for you.Lacky.It's not a job, you're a tacky. You're not even that fucking funny. This gets Ira very mad.Mission accomplished.I'm not going anywhere!Who are you to fucking judge anyone? You're not my friend, you just want my money. You just want to get your foot in the door.Wake me when we get home. George climbs in the back seat and tries to go to bed.Why didn't you drive me to my house?You'll drop it off later.So that's how it's going to be.Hey, how's it going?This is Randy. He's funny, you'd like his stuff. It's smart.No, that's ok. I don't want to take Ira's spot. I'm just gonna hang out tonight.Do you have any turkey that's hormone-free?So this is where you work.I thought we were writing a screenplay.Or any kind of partner. You want to make me a turkey sandwich and talk to me? They give you breaks around here?In my travels, I have learned a lot about Asia and Buddhism. And I would like to be in the moment now with you, and to tell you how sorry I am, and how much I have appreciated your friendship. And even if we are not friends in the future, I wish you well on your journey. Ira laughs.But also kind of cool. It's a very weird combination.I think most of what you said to me was true. And I really am sorry. I think I'm still not very healthy...in my brain.Well, I appreciate you trying to help me. Even though it was kind of an impossible task.I am not doing well, but things have certainly been worse. So, I will be fine.Really? Any new jokes you're working on?What do you got? Ira is surprised to hear him ask this, since he has never asked this before.You should do something about how, when you date a girl, and you feel really good and she likes you, and then you see pictures of all her ex- boyfriends, and they're all really goofy-looking guys, and it's not that you're good looking, it's just that in this psychotic girl's eyes, you're good looking?Why don't you say Dom Deluise? it's a more current reference.Okay, okay. What else you got?You should say, now when I masturbate, I have to think about the last time I masturbated.You know, I always wanted to be part of the comedy field. As the camera pulls back, George continues to pitch Ira jokes for his act, the first selfless act we've seen him commit in the entire film. As their friendship rekindles, we...", "clean_line": "hey george simmons coming sure buddy let college students arm george takes picture yeah bud picture thanks tell friends like lunestas sleep giving

friendship rekindles"}, "IRA": {"raw_line": "Yes, ma'am.It means there's no additives or preservatives and it's hormone free.I don't know ma'am.I haven't heard about that. But I may not be informed enough to comment.You are correct, I am not a doctor.You should come see me do stand-up tonight at the Comedy and Magic Club.That was five months ago. I've gotten a lot better.Nah, not there. I just hang out and hope somebody doesn't show.Dude, I know you like it here but if I have to work here another year I would kill myself.Just come. I need the support.I'll pay your cover charge.Laughter's the ultimate lubricant.I was thinking about doing something about how I'm not good looking and I'm not bad looking. I'm just good looking enough that if I had a good personality, it could put me over the top. If that was the case.I had a joke once about how you never see incredibly hot, blonde, homeless women. Because someone will always take care of that kind of woman. That woman could be the dumbest person on earth and she will survive in this world.That could work.That's not cool. I came up with the concept! What do you got? Let's work on what you have.How could they make you a regular? I got turned down twice.No we didn't see it. Just don't leave those things laying around.I thought you were moving out.She's in our apartment? I've never even talked to her. I just gave her quarters at the washing machine.I need time. I have a three-month plan.Nice to meet you. I think I gave you quarters once. Ira walks over to the kitchen area, takes out a paper cup. He pours some orange juice without looking and the paper cup falls over and spills all over the counter. Mark looks horrified.Don't worry, I'll just lick it off the counter. Nobody laughs. Ira starts wiping up the OJ with a rag.Well how long is he going to do?Well what about the magician? He just loaded his pigeons. He said I have to get off in ten minutes.I just got bumped by George Simmons.He's killing the crowd. Jesus, I can't follow this shit. After completely losing the crowd, and some minor confrontations with audience members, he exits the stage.I'm not good looking. I'm not bad looking. I'm just in the middle. And if I had a personality that was Jut good enough, it would put me over the edge. The joke fails. We reveal George also watching him bomb, amused by his struggle. He sees something he likes in Ira.Sorry, man. I didn't mean to disturb you. I just can't open my door. There's no room.Thanks!Well, I'll probably bomb worse tomorrow and forget about this one.Well, obviously, I'm a... you know...I grew up on your shit, man. George just stares at him.Holy shit, you got seven hundred thousand hits in four days.Hello?Yeah. Who is this?Oh my gosh. Hey, how is it going?Definitely. What kind of jokes? Leo passes by in the background. We see Ira decide not to include him in this job offer.No problem. Where do you want me to send em?It's a...irasexira\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00aegmail.com.Ok.That was George Simmons. He wants me to write jokes for him.I don't know, but he is gonna send me his email address.Easy. Let me get in there a little more.Thanks man. I just want to give you a lot of choices.Oh, it was fun to try to write in your voice. I spent the whole night pretending I was you.Yeah! That'll work.No you can't. Because then we look like fans.He doesn't watch your show. You're show is for eight-year-olds. It's a family show, he doesn't watch that shit.Yeah, this'll be fun.You don't have to do that. What if I bomb?(turning white fromUh...credits? I don't really have any credits. Maybe you could just say I've been working on Apples for so long, my first one weighed more than I did. Nobody laughs.I panicked. They just wanted jokes about computers.But there's a lot more. The first three on this page. You didn't think they would work, but I think they will. You should just try them.Are you serious? ANGLE ON DAVE on stage.Sure. I like fun.That's the most money I've ever made doing anything in comedy.Well, I didn't make a hundred grand like you.You are very pretty.I didn't say anything was going to happen. I just said you were pretty. How do you even know I wanted something to happen?I guess so.Did you have sex with both of those girls?That is crazy. That is super crazy.How can that even happen? I guess I understand the first one, but why would the second one do it? You probably stink of the first girl.What?She wouldn't fool around with me because she said she had a boyfriend.I should get going.I may have to whack it in your guest room.Thanks. That was fun. It was rare that I get to play to more than twenty-five people. I've never played for a thousand.it, s kind of easier, because even if two hundred like me, it sounds like a lot.Why would you say that?No.They're bananas. And always broke. They got divorced ten years ago, but they both act like it just happened last week. They hate each other. They always put me in the middle of it. I always wanted them to say, \"We don't want you to suffer through this, so we're just going to handle it ourselves.\" They never would do it. They would always make me feel their pain all the time. I would never do that for my kids. Because it's like they._`.re kids. And no matter how many times I tell them to leave me out of it, they never do. Ira notices that George is very close to falling asleep.I'll let you crash.Alright. So... I work at a supermarket at the deli counter. I hate it, but the money's actually pretty good. Better than you'd think. But I'd rather do comedy full-time if I could. The camera pulls back as Ira continues to talk, and we begin to HEAR George snoring, as Ira continues to talk anyway.okay.Eggs.What are you doing, man? Are those vitamins?What do you got?Are you fucking with me? That's not funny, man.I never heard that before. That would be a big deal.You're not going to tell anybody? You told me.I don't know, man. I don't think you want to go through this alone. I think you've got to tell people. Your family. Your friends.What? Anything, man.What does that mean?I can't do that!Fifty thousand dollars? Can I at least take a little time to think about it?You're an asshole.That's not cool, man. You told me you're going to die and you want me to euthanize you. I almost had a heart attack.Don't do this. My friends do this all the time. They trick me, and then they trick me again. I'm very gullible. Don't do it.Are you religious? Does that give you any comfort?No.He doesn't want to be that guy. He picked up two girls at a bar. Then he had sex with his. And then he came out and had sex with mine.No.No, what I'm saying is...He's so lost right now that he's hiding from the world. And he's trying to distract himself by doing stand-up and having sex with a lot of women. And he doesn't want anyone to know but me.Because he doesn't know me. So he doesn't give a shit.No, I think we had kind of an instant connection. The other roommate, JAY, walks by.Shut up, Jay. Jay keeps walking.I feel like he's crying out for help, and I can help him. He's made us so happy in our lives, this is our chance to do something from him during this time. There's a lot of wisdom we can take from this. What he's going through. We can apply it to our lives.No, what is life all about? What is important? How should we decide to live this precious life? REVEAL that Mark is crying.That's why we should talk about it! You can't run from it, man. This could make us into better people. This is an opportunity.Well I'm going to fucking learn something. Mark cries even more.Hello.Sure.Absolutely. What do you want to pay me? They close the doors, drive off.Okay, that could work. We can tell that this amount of money could change Ira's life.I was thinking maybe you should do some material about what you're going through, being sick. There could be something really powerful, and it would mean a lot to people, that you would share that with them.It could be classic stuff. For the ages.Grandma! Get off the fucking phone. Don't run up my fucking bill.George? George? He walks through the house, finds George in bed. For the first time he seems sick.Are you all right?It's three in the afternoon.Well do you need anything?I. .I. .can't anyway. I'm doing the late shift at the deli counter.I know, I just want to be safe, make sure I can pay my bills. I don't like to be nervous about that shit.Notice? I'm not giving you any notice. I'm just quitting.Why would I give you notice? I'm not trying to stay in Ralph's good graces. I'm not trying to preserve my good standing at Ralph's.I'm just quitting. You don't quit and then keep working for two weeks.I wish I could help you, but I'll kill myself if I keep working here. It's not what I want to do. Maybe Gail can cover my shifts.I don't know. Get someone to cover from a different Ralph's. There are thousands of them in Southern California. No one else can scoop macaroni into a bowl? I'm not the linchpin that keeps Ralph's from falling into chaos.You know what? I'm glad you said that, because I was about to tell you I could work this weekend. What's your problem? I didn't say anything bad about you, I just said I didn't want to work for Ralph's anymore. Chuck takes a step to Ira like he's going to hit him. Ira steps back a few feet.I'll tell Dave. I'll tell Dave. I tried to do this politely. The thanks I get.See you, Phyllis. You're nice.Hey, Daisy.Ira.I was gonna try to hunt down tickets to see Wilco at the Greek Theatre. You want to come? Are you into them at all?Okay. I'll call you with the details. Hopefully I'll be able to get seats which will not require high-powered binoculars.Perfect. Then I can play you their live album in my car and trick you into thinking we have front row seats. That won't work.That wasn't funny at all. I'm gonna leave while I'm ahead right now. She smiles. He walks away.George? Ira walks into George's bedroom. He hears something, pokes his head in. In the dark, he can barely see George making phoney calls by himself. Ira listens for awhile, not sure what to make of this. George doesn't see him.I was thinking you need to tell someone about your situation... your condition.I feel like maybe you're holding everything in and I can understand why you don't want to deal with it because why would anyone want to deal with it. But I bet you have a lot of unfinished business with your friends. Wouldn't it make you feel a lot better to get your affairs in order? What do people do at this moment Don't they have to do stuff?Everything has changed. At some point you're going to get really sick and you need your friends and family around you. I'm sure there's a lot of business, estate issues, I don't know. Maybe you'll feel better than if you just deal with everything. Where are your parents?Friends?I think if you talk to people you'd find out a lot of people care about you. You're kind of old already, I mean, compared to me. I'm sure you touched a lot of people's lives. You can't spend the rest of your days making phoney phone calls alone in your room.Well maybe that's the problem. Maybe if you told more people you'd have more people to call. You can't just talk to me about it, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. You're the first person I've known who's sick. I'm not good at it. (eyes beginning to wellI'm sorry.(tears streaming down hisThat was first and last time. I'm not even crying anymore.I don't think I am. I think I'm not anymore. I'm not sure what you're talking about.I'm sorry, George. I really don't know what to do, I don't know how to help you.Do you want me to call them, and tell them what's going on?Fuck. I was hoping you were gonna say no.Hi, this is Ira, I'm a friend of George's. He asked me to call you. His roommates are making a commotion outside. Ira covers the receiver.Will you guys shut the fuck up? Shut the fuck up! Ira slam the door.I'm sorry. I have some news about George.Afterwards you'll be happy you did it.I think George is going to take a nap now.You have to, you have no choice. You're doing good. And you're almost done, don't worry.I was thinking we should go skiing somewhere. You're still physically doing well, and that's not going to last forever. You should do something active. Go to Colorado, or Tahoe, or something. Or do something crazy. Go to Switzerland, or Sweden, or wherever they have mountains.I don't know, I don't even ski, but you do. Maybe you should do something like that. Ira notices George is falling asleep, so he talks more quietly. He's gotten good at this.If it's too hard, we can just ski for an hour or two a day, and then get drunk at the bar. You can hit on hot ski instructors, and then I can masturbate in the room thinking about you fucking hot ski instructors. He thinks George is asleep, so he walks out as he speaks.Whatever. It'll be fun to be in the mountain air, fun to look at the mountains. Maybe you shouldn't even be here. We can hang out there as long as you want, I got nothing to do. Ira closes the door.Hey. How's it going?I guess it's been more than ten days.Don't worry about it, it doesn't matter, I don't give a shit. Leo walks in the front door.I've been getting good weekend spots.What's with you guys? You both want to fuck my mother too? What more do you want to do to me tonight? Ira walks away.So now you're with Mark? You're his girl?You got a lot accomplished in one night. How did this happen?Must have been a great episode. I should get a job on a shitty show so I can use it as foreplay.I am not treating you like anything. Do what you want. I don't give a shit. I'll go to Wilco alone.How could you do that? I thought we were going out on a date.I bought tickets to Wilco and I worked all week to get a reservation at a place that doesn't normally let people like me eat there. I just didn't see this coming. Yes, you're right. You can do anything you want. I'm glad this fucking happened, before I wasted the night with you. I didn't think you were that kind of person. That you would sleep with a guy like that.No, I think he's a pussyhound.You got excited because he's the star of the show. You literally star-fucked.I thought you were joking.I just bought these two Wilco tickets. Wanna go?Come on, are you kidding me? We all want to be you. Most of my comic friends are just doing a bad impression of you. People love your shit.It's a lot.What are you doing?You're not feeling good?Oh my god, oh my god! Ira goes to hug George, but it's a very awkward moment. Ira really wants a happy hug, but George is instantly uncomfortable.I was happy to help.Uh-huh.Yeah, we'll figure it out.It's always good to keep breaking new ground.Well, I'm gonna start thinking. And...I'm really happy for you. Are you freaking out right now?And he thanked me for helping him, and I really think I was a help during this time. I'm not saying that's why he got better, but he definitely had good energy and I hear that helps your immune system.I don't know, he said one or two hundred thousand.Thank you for the advice, Bob. That's very helpful.What are you talking about?So I have to? I just stopped working at a supermarket two weeks ago. I'm trying to create some financial stability for myself. The first time I make any real money, I can't just give it to her.Well you guys went on a cruise to Greece last year. Maybe you shouldn't have gone, and saved for her college education.I had to drop out of college after two years because you couldn't pay for it. Now I have to pay for hers? Let her figure it out. Let her get a job.Then sell your house. Move into a smaller house. Use the extra money to pay for her college. Or tell her to work for a year or two, make some money, then she can pay for her own college. No one helped me out, I'm just digging out from under now.One good thing happens to me in my entire life, and you have to try and take it away and ruin it.Hey George, we're doing an Orphan's Thanksgiving tomorrow night, want to come? It's just for us losers who don't have any family to eat with.Sure. What time? Do you need me to bring anything? 3 O'clock at my apartment. Bring wine that we can't afford. The computer bings.That's pretty much all wine on earth. See you then.Hey Faggots, I know what you're doing. Stop emailing me. It's not amusing anymore. They all start high--fiving.I've just been busy. Will you excuse me? Ira gets up, walks out of the room.You don't have to lie to him. He knows it's not good.Come on, Futoran, we're about to eat.I don't want to right now.I didn't expect you to blurt it out like that. That was very honest of you.This is making me uncomfortable. The whole thing, it makes me uncomfortable.I actually scalped them and made a hundred bucks.I'm sorry I got so upset with you, because it shows you how much I like you, which is weird because we've hardly spoken. I understand all of that.Well, you smell right to me. Daisy smiles at Ira, just as Leo stomps back into the room. He charges right up to Ira, pissed off.Uh...yes.I didn't think you would want to.I'm sorry, it's just, I needed the gig. And you are doing so much better than me. I guess I just wanted this for myself.I did. And it was fucked up. And I am sorry. I don't know what to say.Are you serious?I never told Leo because I wanted the gig?Well I fucking live with you now because he told me to leave.He said friends don't lie and I'm fucking with his career.Fuck off.Thank you for letting me stay here.No. You want to come talk to me while I crash?See, the thing I was thinking, was...you always play an immature guy. What if the joke of the movie is you're incredibly smart, intellectual and well-mannered. You just go the opposite way with it.I. .I gotta go through my notes.Well we'll still write the script, right?Let's just keep banging at it.You have a date? Who do you have a date with?You know what you should do, just as an experiment? You should try and not fuck her?Because you're always saying you don't know if women like you for who you are. You don't know if they like you because you have money or you're famous. Why not take some time and get to know them before ass-raping them. In a romantic way.See, you can't do it. You can't even entertain the idea of getting to know somebody for a month before sleeping with them.What nationalities have you slept with?New Jersey. Do handjobs count? Because then also California.How big a theater?You should have told me so I could have prepared. I've never played a place that big. How long do you want me to do?Shit.I don't own anything nice.How fucking up north is this?So we have like five more hours to drive?I don't like how you made me your limo driver. It's weird you're in the back and I'm up here.I can't even listen to the radio because you're watching the movie. Can I sit back there and you drive?What happened?I'm afraid so. I've been told if I'm good it warms the crowd, and if I'm bad it makes them want George more, so...You didn't tell her that you're not sick anymore? Why wouldn't you tell her?Me? Why do you want me to tell her?That's weird.You had to do this to me right before my set. Like I'm not nervous enough.You seem surprised.Thank you. Hopefully George won't be mad if I tired the audience out.So you guys were dating right when he started doing well?Where did you meet him?You don't seem like a bitch.Sounds like fun days.I don't know if you've heard, but it looks like George's medicine is working.He just found out. He doesn't want to jinx it. He doesn't want people to get excited, and then have it come back again. The lights go down.Why do we have to stop by there tomorrow? The drive is long enough as it is. George opens up his wallet, gives Ira a thousand dollars.I'm excited to see her ranch. I hear it's delightful.Why couldn't we have gotten two different rooms?So, what happened with you and Laura? You seem to get along so well. Why did you cheat on her?How many times did you cheat on her?Jesus.Why do you want to go see her tomorrow? We could do something productive like get some writing done.I don't want to watch adult movies with you.Okay.You okay, buddy?Can I live here?That's crazy, owning a horse. I can't even keep a goldfish alive.How old are you?Really? Because I thought you were like nine, about to turn ten.My hair. I have curly hair too. Curly hair is the best.If you straighten my hair, I look crazy. I look like the killer from No Country for Old Men. Have you seen that movie? MABLE, Laura's ten-year-old daughter storms into the room.Yo, dawg. That was the bomb. It was a little pitchy in places, but I dug it. I really dug it.I don't know, Dawg. It was a bad song choice. I'm not feeling it.But it's like a seven, eight hour drive home. If we stay for dinner, we're not going to get home till like four in the morning. George stares at Ira for a beat, then --No.Sure. I'm great with kids. I was a camp counselor for five years. Camp Winadu. Kids love me. I'm like a human teddy bear.If you had an Exacto knife we could cut these sticks in half and make a chimney.Why would you say that?George is gonna be fine.Here's the truth. George was really sick.But he went to the doctor and they found the right medicine and now he's better. And he's gonna live a long time. The kids buy it, and Ira seems relieved.You're back. That was quick.Where are the groceries?What's taking so long with the pizza? Before anyone can say anything the PIZZA DELIVERY GUY appears in the doorway.It tastes just like New York pizza, which is so surprising because you can't get good pizza in Los Angeles, so you wouldn't think you could get it in Northern California. But this really tastes like New York pizza. A long pause.My friend backpacked across China and he caught some sort of virus or something from what he ate. He was sickforweeks. He still has it. It'sthekind of thing you can't getridof, you have it for the restofyour life, but it stays dormant.I'd love desert. What do you have? Do you have any ice cream or cake, or anything like that? I have a real big sweet tooth right now. Why don't we go into the kitchen and do an ice cream bar with kids right now? I've got a better idea, I make a really good milkshake. We should all go make milkshakes with the kids right now in the kitchen.Either that or they're all young and they just look like shit. Clarke laughs.They are beautiful, but we have to get going. We have a really long drive to get back to Los Angeles.No, I'm just big-boned.We really do need to get back. I have to visit my mom. I can't miss it. It's her birthday. Everyone in my family is coming in from across the country for it. She's turning 65. It's very important we get back for it.Well ...I don't how you define these things-I'm not... sure.Oh shit. It's ON.He was sick. He was very sick.What the fuck is going on? Did you guys do something?Why?But she has two kids, she's married.You cheated on her.He was trying to cure you with herbs. He seems like a great guy.I can't stay out of it. We took your car here. I have no way of leaving.So what are we gonna do?Hey, Daisy. It's Ira.I just wanted to talk to you because I'm in the middle of a terrible situation and I don't have anyone I can talk about it with. My friends are all mad at me and George is kind of losing his mind.Look, I know you think I have the moral code of some guy from the 50s like Dwight Eisenhower, but I'm with George and he's hitting on his ex-girlfriend who's married now and has kids and I don't know what to do. I'm kind of freaking out. I think I'm having a panic attack.Well telling me to not have a panic attack is not going to stop it.Haha, very funny.Well I guess they dated like ten years ago...It's 10:15 in the morning.They don't look that tired. The kids are yelling and screaming and clearly have eight more hours in them.I wet the bed til I was eleven. It wasn't even a mental thing. I just got relaxed when I was asleep.So when are we going to go home? You're not talking at all about when we're going to go home.Are you okay with everything? This is happening pretty fast.Okay.She's nice. I don't really know her very well.Yeah, well when you have two kids and a husband, and horses and ducks, it's not all about fucking.That's just the hormones of youth. I'm all about fucking. But I don't expect to be when I get older. I'll be occasionally about fucking, which is normal. The fact that you're all about fucking now is the weird thing.What does that mean?She's about to leave her husband for good. She has two kids. You're not sure this is going to work?Well, she'll live with you.Of course. What else would she do?You don't want to hang with the kids?okay, but I've got to run out and grab some cigarettes.I never smoked in front of you because you were sick. But I do.Holy shit, holy shit. Where's the fucking airport around here? Ira tries to figure out how to work the navigation system in a panic. He can't make it work.How do you get to the fucking airport?!I'm getting cigarettes.I got lost. I don't know this town.Ok, I'll hurry back.Oh, I'm just headed back to Los Angeles. I've got some spots at the Improv I've got to do this weekend.This is the International terminal? I'm so confused, I've never been to this airport before.An adult is watching them.What the hell happened?Uh oh. Ira runs out of the lounge. Laura runs out also.No, no, no! I'm here. I'm here.George! Clarke is coming back to the house. He knows everything! I'm coming to get you. Be at the end of the driveway. No! Be at the next driveway over! To the north!Okay.I am a good friend because this entire situation is crazy. You are out of control.When I got there, she was already kissing him. I never even had a chance to stop it. I didn't get to do anything!You told me not to jump in.I know, that's why I became a comedian, because everyone used to beat me up! George runs at Clarke who cracks him in the head hard, sending him to the floor. Then Ira takes a run at him and Clarke kicks Ira in the face twice, with both feet. Laura runs into the middle of the scene.We're just playing that's all.That was meaner than him punching you. That is a demented motherfucker. George punches Ira in the face. Ira fires back two punches at George's face and he stumbles back.Get the hell off of me you psycho.No.Fine.You are the most self involved person I have ever met.No matter what the situation, no matter how many laughs or how many women you get you will never be happy. You're always going to be miserable. You are a bottomless pit. A bottomless wound.I am not responsible for you. You wanted me to sit back and destroy this woman's life? Help you cheat on her? You put me in a terrible position. I don't give a fuck, go fuck yourself.You made me the tacky? I'm not a lacky, it's a job.Who cares? If being funny means being like you, I rather be a little less funny.You're the only person I know who learned nothing from a near-death experience! You actually went backwards. All it did was it brought out what a prick you are, brought everything bad to the surface. I liked you better when I was sure you were gonna die.Everything is about you. You don't even know where I live. You've never asked me one question about my life. How much can one person talk about himself ? You never ask me shit about anything!Fuck your money. Fuck you. This has all been a huge mistake.okay, I'm getting out. You have to drive yourself home. I'm getting out here.Because then I'd still have your car.There is no later! I'm not going to ever talk to you again. So I don't want your car.Oh man, you got jerked off on that couch.Thanks. I'm sorry, I lost my way for a while.Hey George.I'm sure I would. I look forward to seeing it. Are you going on tonight?I made it myself this morning.I stake my reputation on it.Mrs. Gail, this fine woman would like a quarf'of potato salad. The woman moves to the other side of the counter. We reveal George standing there, holding his ticket.Yes we do.Back in the saddle.Well, you're not a very good writing partner.That guy was a douche-bag.He was going to heal you with those herbs, man. You get sick again, you should call that guy.It's all right, man. You've been through a lot.Is everything going okay? How are you doing?I'm actually going up tonight.Yeah, I've been trying to get off my ass and do some writing.I was thinking about doing a bit about how I'm not very good looking, but I'm not bad looking, but I'm just good-looking enough that if I had a good personality, it might put me over the top.And how all of her boyfriends look like Lou Costello.More current? What year was Cannonball Run, 1978?I was going to talk about how I haven't had sex in so long, that I can't even remember my previous sexual experiences so I can masturbate to them.That's a good one.

see you.You don't have to be sorry, that was like 12 years ago. Everything worked out for the best. We see this hurts George.Don't do this.I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for what's happening to you.Maybe I over reacted. I didn't have to leave you.And the funny thing is...my husband, he is on the road a lot for business. He did the same thing last year.No. I have kids now.You were the one and only magic relationship in. my life. She starts to cry. He does too. They embrace.There's never been anything like you before or since. I love Chris, but it's not the same. It's fine, maybe it isn't even fine, but we had something special.I love you too George. I wish there was something I could do.I wouldn't have missed it for the world, thanks for inviting me.Hi Ira. Are you performing tonight?You look great. How are you feeling?I thought a lot about you after I left.Well the show is going to start in a minute, I better get to my seat. I just wanted to say hi. Don't be too dirty tonight, you know that makes me uncomfortable.Okay. Break a leg. She exits.Ira. Oh my gosh. You were so good.I don't know, you seemed so nervous. But you were really solid all the way though, and your ending hunk really murdered.I don't think he has anything to worry about. They always go crazy for him. Before he got famous, he used to bomb all the time.And that's when I think he was the funniest. And now that everyone knows him, it's a little too easy for him, I think. No one was funnier when the audience hated him than George. He loved it.Yeah. But you always knew he was gonna do well. He had so much charisma. He would walk into a room and in ten minutes that whole room would be about him. Even before anyone knew who he was.I was the hat-check girl at the Improv. And I was acting. I used to do guest spots on all those shows, like Melrose Place, Beverly Hills 90210. I always played the bitch. I don't know why, but I was on the top of the bitch list.That's because I was acting.It was, for awhile. Reveal George in the wings trying to get a look at them from a distance.What do you mean?Why didn't George tell me?I really don't know what to say. It's not like you weren't good before, but your act is so much more sophisticated, but just as funny. I've never seen you speak so honestly on stage before. You used to say these goofy jokes. It was really something, you know, and you should be really proud of yourself.Well, thanks for inviting me. I'm really glad I came.My husband is actually in China for another week, or so. He spends a lot of time there helping American businesses break into that market. So you won't meet him this time, but it would be great if you came by. That would be fun. I'll give you the tour.Okay. An awkward beat. Laura gives Ira a hug goodbye, then hugs George goodbye, trying to make it appear as if they have equal weight.Bye. I'll see you then. She looks at Ira. As she exits--You were good too.Hi? We've been waiting for you. Come on in.Thanks. We've been here for five years. I think I just finished decorating it. She leads them through the living room into a huge open kitchen. On the island, there is freshly squeezed lemonade, chips and dip. She has over-prepared for their arrival.of course, you can clean the stables.Yes. Clarke, my husband, was a real city boy. But for some reason he loves horses. Of course I'm lef t to take care of them. But yes, we have three horses.I'll come right up. This is my friend, George. And Ira.He's just joking Ingrid.Don't be rude. This is Ira and George.The whole thing is a bad part. George LAUGHS in a slightly flirty fashion with Laura. Ira is getting uncomfortable with the subtext.Okay. Now it's time to see what the judges say. I thought you had a lot of energy, you're clearly gonna make it to the final four, and I love your outfit. What do you think, Randy?Mable, stop it. Stop being mean to your sister. Say something nice.Okay, you're not Simon anymore. Simon, what did you think?Okay Mable, you're up. Mable instantly starts gyrating in a manner that is not appropriate for a ten-year-old and singing the Fergie song \"London Bridge.\"I told you not to do that. Simon, what do you think?Okay, who's next? Randy?All right! Here we go. They start driving down a path that goes around the edge of the ranch. George has his hands around Laura's waist as they drive. Ira looks over, concerned.Me and George are gonna go to the supermarket and buy some food so I can cook dinner. You think you'll be okay watching the kids? It'll only take forty-five minutes.Clarke's company is about forty- five minutes from here. This town seemed so perfect when we were looking for a house. There's no traffic, there's one coffee house, one bookstore, one market. No crime. But after you've lived her a few years you hunger for another coffee shop, a bigger bookstore, and a little crime. It gets so boring. And it's such a small town, God forbid you miss one of you kid's soccer games, they put the scarlet letter on you.We used to have so much fun. I don't think I have that much fun anymore. I don't like who I'm turning into. Is the fun over? I have to get up every morning at six, drive my kids to school and then I have 6 hours before I have to pick them up. I have to yell at them to do their homework, be a taskmaster, then I make them dinner.It takes an hour to shower them and put them to bed. And then it's 8:30 and I pass out. And it's great, but tuck. And when both kids are done with high school I'll be 49 years old, and then I'll have probably 6 very healthy years, then I'll kind of slow down and then I'll be an old woman. And that was it. And it's great, but fuck.Yes. Being a mom is very fulfilling, but there are other parts of me and every once in awhile I go a little crazy.I just get bored and depressed. And you know how my PMS is kind of out of control. This little boy hit Ingrid in school, and his mom acted like she didn't care at all, so I told her to fuck off. They both laugh.Screw you.And my husband cheated on me, said he did it once but I know because I learned from you, they do it once, they do it all the time. You either cheat or you don't.That's both flattering and deeply disturbing.We can't go the supermarket.Because people will see us.Well it'll be weird because we're about to do something we shouldn't do.I really never thought I was going to see you again. I grieved for you like you were dead. They continue to kiss. Suddenly she stops.I can't do this.I gotta get back to the kids.We decided ordering in might be a little more fun.Food's here! All right, everybody. Let's sit down at the kitchen table. Everyone gets up and heads toward the kitchen. Laura opens the front door, George is a few steps behind her. A handsome man of forty appears. This is not the pizza guy. It's CLARKS, Laura's husband.Clarke, oh my gosh. What are you doing home?Oh, Clarke. George had a performance last night in town, which I went to, and him and his opening act, Ira, came by to say hello on their way out of town. There is an awkward moment, then Clarke smiles and gives George a compassionate look, the type of look you give a man you think is dying.I'm so glad you're home, honey. Laura gives Clarke a hug and a peck. Then Ira walks over.He speaks Chinese. For real. Ingrid yells at something in Chinese.He's doing really well. He's been very strong.He's been fighting the good fight. His doctors are taking very good care of him. Ira can believe this conversation is happening.Does anybody want seconds? Or should I bring out the desert?Now's not the time to talk about this.He really is the last guy who would buy into that shit.George, stop.Well, I also ran a theatre company. And it was down to me and Cameron Diaz for 'The Mask.' I sacrificed a lot for our family.There's no pollution here like in LA so you can actually see the stars.That's too bad, I wish you could stay.Clarke, don't. You don't need to do that.That was beautiful, honey. Well let me walk them to the car. Ingrid walks over.I never said that he was still sick. He just took some medicine and it's looking better. You can't detect it in his blood, but it could come back.You know what? I don't know what I want now.I've been going through all the bank statements, trying to figure out which are in his name and which are in mine.Almost all the accounts are in his name. I wonder if he did that on purpose.Yeah. My best friend Nancy grows this stuff on a hill by her house. You want some?Not me. It makes me feel sharper, Some people get tired, I get more energy, more clear.What's happening? Whatever we want to happen is gonna happen now. I'm free. I'm fucking free. Laura gets up, kisses him.We're free.A tank could roll through this place, it wouldn't wake them up. They kiss some more. She moans louder.I have to talk to them for a minute. Mable, go wipe your sister's butt.I spoke to Clarke. He's going to fly back to China tonight. I was thinking about driving to the airport and meeting him there and telling him that when he comes back, he should find another place to live.Yes. It's what I want. I just need to figure out when we would move down to LA. It might be better to let the kids finish out the school year because I have to apply to the private schools in LA, and I don't know if I missed the deadline. Then I'd have to look into the charter schools. Sometimes these private schools, if you give them a donation, they let your kids in. Maybe you can stay up here for part of the year if I can't make it happen.I'll be back in an hour and a half, tops. And then it all begins.I love you.I'm sorry too. I love you so much. It was just a flirtation. It never went anywhere. It's just after you cheated on me, I felt so alone. And you were gone so often that I felt like our life doesn't work.Oh, fuck.I don't know what to say.I came here to tell you that I wanted you to move out when you came home. But I realized this was a mistake, so I didn't say it. Please don't hold that against me. We've worked everything out. Everything is fine.Who the fuck are you? Get the fuck out of my life! You and George have to get the fuck out of my life. You are ruining everything!Clarke, please don't do this.Why did you have to come here and confuse me? Everything was fine before you came here. Now everything is all screwed up.With him.You fucked up my life. And now I fucked up yours. But just a little. Probably just for a day.
