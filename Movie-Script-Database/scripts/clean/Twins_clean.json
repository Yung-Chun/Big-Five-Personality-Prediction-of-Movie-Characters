{"Twins": {"JULIUS": {"raw_line": "I have a brother?!!! CUT TO:I have a twin brother?!! What's his name?Vincent -- Every time I loved something I called it Vincent -- I called my first computer Vincent! I have to find him!I know it is the cradle of democracy and the land of the free; besides, I speak twelve languages -- I'm sure I can get a job.My brother will look after me.It's your only copy --Thank you -- I'll miss you.It was an honor to study under you, Master. Without warning, the Oriental tries to strike Julius in the face with the side of his hand, but Julius blocks the blow.I was just thinking, maybe my brother Vincent is married.Well, if a woman loved my brother enough to marry him, she might have a sister who'd feel the same way about me. That often happens with twins, you know.Of course he does. I've always known there was something missing in my life! And deep down, I'm sure Vincent feels the same way! He's probably just like meeeee!'Put on your red dress, baby 'Cause we're going out tonight...' A few passengers turn and look back at --seated in the rear, still in his peasant garb, the bamboo suitcase resting on his lap. He has his headphones on and is singing along to the music, his eyes closed and his head bobbing.'I better wear some boxing gloves, In case some fool might want to fight.'Sorry -- I've never heard this music before -- I love it. * She sighs, leans over him, fastens his seat belt, while Julius gazes down at her ample cleavage.Thank you, Betty Lou.Actually, I'm a horticultural botanist, a mathematician, and a philosopher.turns to the terrified elderly woman beside him who's clutching a hardcover Bible in her lap.Excuse me, ma'am.His mischief shall return upon his own hand, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own head -- Psalm 7:16. In front now, there is a lot of activity as various pass- engers hold the Highjacker, almost arguing over who's in control. Julius looks at them a moment, puts on his headset, closes his eyes and is soon bopping away to the music. CUT TO:... How wonderful...What an amazing country. CUT TO:Sorry, but I don't smoke... pal?I... don't have a girl friend. Do women really wear these things? BIKER #1 If you're lucky. You from out of town? *just sort of standing there, no big deal, not much effort showing on his face as Biker #2 begins to slowly rise into the air as he and his cycle are about to be parted and then --I did nothing, the pavement was his enemy. CUT TO:I would say -- a concussion -- a mild shoulder separation, and ribs four to seven are cracked.Get him to a hospital.And in the future, you should both consider wearing helmets. A sweet smile.So, this is where my brother grew up. I'm glad he had so many friends to play with. *And that's where he must have slept.It's the one I would have chosen. It's next to the fire extinguisher. In case of a fire, I could have given the alarm, and saved the other orphans.Tell me about him. Was he a good athlete? Did he like chess and poetry?This is him? He looks happy -- *I always liked biology.But I have to find him. Where do you think he might be?trying to fight his excitement, watching as the prisoner moves toward him -- -- then past him.Excuse me, but I'm looking for Vincent Benedict.Vincent... dearest Vincent... I have rowed halfway across the world -- no, wrong, I only rowed one day but I came halfway across * the world -- I know you don't know who I am, but believe me when I say I have been waiting for this * moment all my life... It's hard to tell what Vince is feeling but clearly the look of dubiousness is gone. He picks up the phone on his side, gestures for Julius to do the same. As Julius does, Vince at last speaks:Vincent... CUT TO:... Dearest Vincent... Vince glances quickly around to see that no one is listening.I know you don't know who I am, but -- I came halfway across the world ---- I don't know any Klane brothers. I'm your brother, Julius.I don't know any Klane Brothers.My name is Julius -- I'm your twin brother.We're not identical twins.You don't believe a word I've said, do you?Vincent, I don't lie. I am your brother. Let me help you get out * of here.Yes.How can bullshit walk? Is that slang?I have some more money --I am happy to help you, Vincent. You're my brother. I love you.Tossing cookies, that is more slang?I know what you're thinking?You're thinking that this whole twin business is what you call 'bullshit.'You can take some more money --Sure...That's -- -- your car, isn't it? CUT TO:We're twins!I'm so excited -- we'll go to museums together, discuss philosophy together, read books together -- play chess together --Deserted, alone in the sea of cars.These are most unfriendly acts you are committing.I don't know what the problem is, but I'm sure it can be solved without resorting to violence.Good. * Julius lets go of Klane, who gets to his feet, turns around, and instantly lets fly with his fist at Julius's face.You moved too soon. Klane spins and aims a karate kick at Julius's head. Julius coolly ducks it and sends Klane crashing into a wall.An important rule in a crisis * situation -- negotiate first, attack last. You never negotiated. You don't know what kind of enemy I am.Vincent's brother.You have no respect for logic -- *-- And I have no respect for those with no respect for logic. You're a very stupid person.As he heaves Klane across the corridor into the open elevator Klane crashes down hard just as the door slides shut and... CUT TO:I hate violence.I don't think I could fight for money.I'm worried about you, Vincent. They reach Vince's Mustang and get in.How much money do you owe? Don't lie -- we're twins, I can feel your pain.Twenty thousand?I'd love to. Julius reaches into the glove compartment, takes out the car manual, begins speed reading it, running his index finger down the center of each page.Learning to drive. Vince isn't sure what's going on at this point. Now Julius studies Vince's shifting moves, the way his hands work the steering wheel. Now he's back to the manual. Now he's staring at Vince. Vince and Julius's heads are both in motion now -- Julius's from the book to the wheel, Vince's from the road to Julius's finger. As their heads keep turning -- CUT TO:What's the matter?Handicapped children?Maybe we should try to open it ourselves... Vince raises his eyebrows in mock surprise.Of course -- it's for the children... CUT TO:When the back end is raised to an angle greater than 45 degrees, a mercury switch activates the automatic cutoff system. The alarm's computer thinks the car is being towed away and shuts off.Vincent Benedict's car. Vincent! Where are you?Hi, Vincent.The brake -- right.The brakes worked just fine!I'm sorry. I had no idea these magazines had things like that... inside them. Julius tries to stuff the centerfold back into the maga- zine, but only manages to crumple it. Linda and Marnie exchange a look.As a matter of fact, a small tropical island, in the South Pacific, about 300 nautical miles south-southwest of Fiji. I only got here yesterday, but already * I've found my wonderful brother. *My twin brother, Vincent. Linda and Marnie, stunned, look from Vince to Julius.You all know each other?Sisters?Goodbye girls, see you soon. And he guns off too -- only in his excitement he's gone into reverse.I've only been drivng for an hour. Now he follows Vince.Linda is your girl friend, isn't she?Is Marnie your girl friend, too?She hardly knows me. A beat.No.That's private.You named your cat, Julius?He won the Nobel Prize.I think it's important we try to find our fathers.Why are you being so immature about this? * Vince throws down his napkin.Dear Sister Anderson, your request for orphans benefits for Vincent Benedict has been denied. According to our files his mother did not die during birth. We have a current address for her at 172 Canyon Glen Drive, Los Angeles. Vincent's case seems to be one of simple abandonment and as such he is inelligible for aid. Vince snatches the paper back. Julius stares at him, just stunned.This letter was written thirty * years ago. We were five years old * -- Our mother... didn't die when we were born... You've known all this time where she was and you never contacted her?Vincent, if they lied to us about Momma for all these years, maybe they lied to her, too. We must find her, we must check this address. *Everyone seems so angry in America.I'm terribly sorry to disturb your party and I realize this might sound strange, but I'm looking for someone who lived here a long time ago... Mary Anne Benedict. Granger reacts; he's speechless. Julius hands him the group photo of his mother, six fathers, Traven, and Werner.She was my mother. Granger looks at the photo, then at Julius.One of my fathers --Why didn't you?Until yesterday I didn't even know she might still be alive... Who told her we died?I have a twin brother, Vincent.I'll go see him.No, I don't -- but I'm learning.Vince, the most amazing thing has happened.I met one of our fathers. He told me of a man in New Mexico who probably knows where Momma is.She didn't abandon you -- she didn't even know you were born!And she was told that I died!-- New Mexico is on the way to Houston.Vincent, we have to go see this man Traven in New Mexico!Yes we do! And I'm coming with you!You're right -- I'll take a shower -- be right back --'Put on your red dress, baby, 'cause we're going out tonight...' She puts the photo back as the sound of SHOWER STOPS. Julius emerges from the bathroom, clutching a towel around his waist, and freezes at the sight of Marnie.Marnie -- excuse me -- I was just taking a shower.Not at all -- I'm really looking * forward to tasting them. * * I should put on some clothes -- But I'm not sure...I hope Vince doesn't mind if I borrow one of his shirts.That's a great idea, Vince.What?No. Why?Let's rock and roll. He opens the car door and climbs in.That's not necessary. I always sleep on the floor. Vince looks askance at Julius, then pulls the car away. HOLD ON Linda and Marnie, gazing curiously after them. CUT TO:You still think I'm making it all up, don't you? CUT TO:He's lying!For the first time in my life, I am -- -- pissed off!I'm going to make him tell us the truth...That's our mother -- those are our six fathers -- that's Werner -- and that's you! Start talking!It's not true, Vince.He's wrong.Tell us where our mother is... * dickhead!If you're lying to me. I'll be back. Julius tosses him aside.You're wrong, Vincent. Your life's just about to begin.I know.We had six fathers, Vince. We're different parts of a lot of different people. Vince is starting to get interested again.And remember, I was taken to a beautiful island, protected, educated, loved, given every opportunity to grow, to dream, to create. But you had none of that.You had nobody. Nobody to love you, nobody to trust you, nobody to encourage you. All life taught you was that the only person you could count on was yourself. Tears begin to well up in Vince's eyes.You're the missing part of my life and I'm the missing part of your life. And when we find our mother we can fill the missing part of hers. We won't be alone anymore, Vince. We can be a family. Vince looks at his brother. A beat.... and a real home where you'll always be welcome.Even when you've been bad.Is this necessary?Do I look okay?I read the book.We know where to find our momma!Vince, you've got to help me -- I've never been out on a date before... what should I do?You dance with them? *-- Thank you for this, Vince --Did you know they had beer in ancient Egypt?Actually it was invented by the Assyrians, but the Eygptians were the first people to perfect the malt fermentation process.Can I ask you a question?Am I shit-faced yet? Linda, surprised, does a spit-take with her beer.I better see if mine are, too. Julius takes off after Vince.You do that too, huh?I don't think she really likes me.Were you nervous?For me, too, Vince! Sometimes I'm so happy, I want to pick you up and hug you! Julius starts to do so, just as another man enters.What do you want?Don't touch him.You moved too soon...The second rule in a crisis situation:If you choose to bluff, you must be prepared to have your bluff called.Quite a few. They were formulated by a Kendo swordsman in the 17th century, but their philosophical underpinnings can be applied to many other areas of life.Where you going?What a day, Vincent, we visited our birth place. We bought new clothes. We danced the waltz. We get into a fight -- We've got this great room. It just doesn't get any better than this.You forgot your key -- I know. Lucky I waited up. Julius opens the door, revealing Marnie, who walks in right past him.Either... I always sleep on the floor.Good night. Julius puts the blanket and pillow from the other bed onto the floor between the two beds, then shuts off the other lamp. Silence...Good night.Good night.Are you cold?No, please, take my shirt. I'm * baking. Julius strips it off and hands it to her. She puts it on and pulls the blanket over her shoulder. Again she shivers.You still cold?Well, I could give you my...Anything else?Right.No -- that would be okay. They both lie down under his blanket. Silence...Sure. She starts to roll over Julius, then pauses directly above him and looks him dead in the eye.Anything.I... I'm crazy about you, Marnie. But there's something about me you ought to know.I'm a virgin.I think I would have remembered...It's very beautiful, isn't it, Vince?You mustn't always think of money.We'd like to see Miss Mary Anne Benedict, please.You think it's her? I do.We'd like to see Mary Ann Benedict please; is she here?We're her sons.-- It is her --We thought that that woman --I can't wait to meet her.May I ask you a question? Why do you keep referring to her in the past tense?Take it easy, Vincent. It's not her fault.All I wanted was to make us into a family.We'll be fine. And maybe he'll be better off alone.He's been getting out of trouble all his life, he's good at it.I don't know much anymore -- on the island I was smart. Here, I've only made things worse.Don't worry, Linda. I found him once, I'll find him again.He turns away. CUT TO:Don't fuck with me... pal. The Creep falls back.Leave my brother alone!I've got the money.Vincent's twin brother -- we're in this together.Don't be nervous -- I hate violence and I never carry guns.I needed something to read on the airplane.You were going to get killed. I tried to distract him so you could escape.So, why didn't you go?Nobody ever said being good was easy.You haven't got any friends.Shoot him. This whole thing is his fault.pulls a gun from his sleeve and blows Webster's weapon out of his hands. Webster screams in pain, clutching his hand, dancing around.From the dead man in the car.I lied.I had to. Vince beams with deep fraternal pride. Then he turns to Webster and snatches the case back.Wait a minute. Webster looks up.You've forgotten something. Webster grips the case tighter.The third rule in a crisis situation.Duck. Suddenly the load hanging from the boom of a nearby crane smashes into Webster's back, and then dumps on him, burying him in rubble.drapes his arm around Vince as they walk towards the unharmed attache case full of money.You came back for me.I always knew you would.Thank you, Vincent.We're a good family. I'm sorry, Vince, but we have to return the money.-- Including us -- think how much * better you'll feel when it's out of our lives --Look at this, Vince -- proposals from the Red Cross, UNICEF, the World Health Organization -- we should only have clients who do humanitarian work.Mamma?Watching them. Now there are tears on his face, too. He goes to them, gently puts his arms around them, lifts them both up in to the air, cradling them. They're laughing. They're crying. They're holding each other.They kepp you up all night again, too?I think you need your diaper changed. What a surprise -- so do you.Just think what we'd be like if we'd been raised together.", "clean_line": "brother cut twin brother vincent time loved called vincent called vincent know cradle democracy

I love this new mattress. It's soft but it's hard at the same time. And I love this new clock.The curtains are the key to the whole thing. They're colorful... they're brilliant... they're... great curtains.Naaaw... I think we're going to be very happy here. Suddenly we hear a DOOR downstairs as it OPENS, and a man's voice drifts up the stairs:What's he doing back so early?You're wonderful, Carla. Your husband doesn't deserve to kiss your feet.'Oh what a beautiful morning, Oh what a beautiful day'... Now he does something surprising -- not starting to drive, we expect that. What we don't expect is his destination -- because what he does is simply turn the nearest corner and drive right back to the house he just snuck out of.... 'everything's going my way'... CUT TO:Carla, what a joy to look at you.Is my partner and best friend, Al home from work yet? I am the bringer of good tidings.For me?A lighter, just like yours. I don't know what to say, Al. I'm all choked up.Good morning, Mr. Klane. I hope you're having a wonderful -- Yes -- no problem -- I have it. Yes. Today. Of course. 'Bye. Vince hangs up.That's part of my good news -- You know that money I picked up from the Jaguar we boosted. Well, * I put the money in the stock * market. I got this incredible * tip. *I can't lose. Ever hear of P.V.T. * Industries? Probably not -- * Secret takeover bid --A very special stock -- and it was such a sure thing -- I borrowed another 20 grand from the Klane * Brothers.On margin -- And as of last night I was ten thousand ahead. I'm * going to make a fortune -- turn on the T.V. CUT TO:I'm wiped out. I got to get some money -- fast. *I'm a desperate man. *Forget it.Me? I laugh myself to sleep every night, and I never sleep alone. I'm doing great! The Owner smiles and turns. Vince continues counting the money, nervous as hell. Now -- CUT TO:Marnie! How are you? Is your * sister around? *What an amazing memory --I am so sorry for all the miserable things I've done to you.I didn't come here for a loan, sweetheart. I came to say goodbye. * It's not safe for me here. People are trying to kill me. Vince starts to rise but Linda pulls him back down.I got involved in the stock market.You are here and so am I, Maybe millions of people go by, But they all disappear from view, And I only have eyes for you... Linda. I only have eyes for you.You inspire me. CUT TO: *It's the baby Klane -- I gotta get the hell out. Burt Klane strolls to the middle of the room, then suddenly turns and faces Linda.The rest is invested. We're gonna make a fortune.Twenty -- ? But I just paid -- Just as he opens his mouth, Vince is elbowed again.That was the most wonderful birthday present anybody ever gave me --I can't take the kindness. It gives me the shakes.Fifty-three dollars? You gotta * be kidding.So? Do I look normal to you?At you, you jerk. The Seven Footer rises angrily to his full size. Vince moves right in on him -- he may be going through a bad patch, but make no mistake, Vince is tough.Tyrone Davis, averaged 23 points, eleven rebounds and four blocks a game his senior year. First round pick of the L.A. Clippers and now look at him.World International Athletics * Representation. Vincent Benedict -- President. I coulda got you a no-cut contract so you wouldn't have to heist T.V. sets for a living --Call me when you get out, they're always looking for centers in Italy...You gotta talk into the phone, * asshole. Julius is confused, momentarily.listening, somewhat amazed. Who is this loony?-- Whoa. I still got another six hours to pay the money back. You * tell those crummy Klane brothers that harassing a man when he's already in the slammer is beneath even them --Huh? Again?Yeah. Go on -- I got that part.Obviously -- the minute I sat down I felt like I was looking in a mirror.I wouldn't be too sure.-- That's right. I don't believe a word you said. *Oh... you want to help me get outta here?Well, money talks, bullshit walks.I'm in fast company here -- Listen, you get me outta here, I'll be whatever you want, best friend, brother, nephew, niece, grandma...Just don't ask me to bend over --Listen, 'twinny,' I hope you didn't blow your wad on those tickets, 'cause it's gonna cost a bunch more to release my car.You do?Julius -- look -- ease up on the love talk or I'm gonna be tossing my cookies, all right?Just gimme your wallet, okay? As Julius sweetly hands it over --No, you don't.Actually, I was thinking I'm going to need some more money -- to put gas in my car --I can?We're brothers -- right? Julius tries to drape an arm around Vince's shoulder. Vince gives him a look. Julius drops his arm. TIME CUT TO:They arrest you, they put you * behind bars, they fine you and * then they hide your car. *Yeah -- How'd you know that was my car.-- Get lost together -- And on that, he GUNS his CAR the hell away, leaving Julius standing there.It was time to redecorate anyway. The PHONE RINGS -- Miss Busby drops to her knees beside it.Miss Busby -- Stacy -- this is a transition period for the corporation -- Why don't you take a few days off.'Aqua-Velva' -- you shouldn't have -- She takes her purse, smiles, goes. When he's alone, into phone:I hope you got some good news, * Al -- *Great, I'll be right over. Vince drops to his knees in order to replace the phone into its receiver. He then scrambles up, straightens his suit, heads for the door, making sure his pony tail is perfect. CUT TO:In agony, on his knees. It hurts to breath. He finally manages to look up at the giant --Did you hit me yet? 'Cause I didn't feel nothin'.We're twins.Watching as Julius picks up Klane with both hands and lifts him a foot up into the air, holding him there for a pause.Tell your brother 'He messes with me, he messes with my whole family!'I like it when you hit people!But you're so good at it. We ought to go into business together. You could be a boxer and I'll be your manager.No problem. You do the fighting, I'll keep all the money.Why do you keep saying that? We're not twins, we're not brothers, we're nothing, and you're only in this car because I could use a little protection these days --Due this morning. CUT TO: *I don't know where my head is -- I forgot I promised this friend of mine -- Sammy -- I'd pick up his car at the airport -- do me a big favor, okay? Drive this car back from the airport for me.What are you doing with that finger?That dopey Sam -- He did it again. Forgot to leave the keys... A lot of handicapped kids are gonna be really disappointed...This car was supposed to be auctioned off at their charity drive tomorrow. Oh, well, let's go eat.You think we should do a thing like that?I saw a guy from the auto club do this once... The door locks suddenly pop up in unison.Whaddya know? Beginner's luck!As he takes a breath, opens the door, scoots inside --No shit... It's beginning to dawn on Vince that there may be more to Julius than meets the eye.There's a supermarket up ahead. Take your foot off the gas and very -- very -- very gently put it on the brake.Lemme tell you something about America, Julius -- nobody likes a smart-ass.That's right... They all turn and look at Vince, who's pulled his cart up behind them.God you look beautiful in this light.Julius, meet Linda and... Her charming sister, Marnie.Goodbye girls, see you soon.Yeah. Kind of.Marnie! Marnie hates my guts. She seemed to like you.That's the best way -- women love men who are mysterious and devious. It keeps them on their toes -- makes them excited you know what I mean?You do like women, don't you?Now correct me if I'm wrong. You're a virgin, aren't you?He's a 230-pound virgin. *Alright! Alright! I got your food. Yes! 'Liver and Cheese,' 'Chicken Giblets,' all your favorites, Julius.The secret to take-out veal Parmesan is adding a little extra cheese. I know you're probably used to growing your own vegetables and spearing fish in the lagoon, but here on the mainland we just nuke it!Dinner is served!So, let me get this right. One of * our fathers was a famous football player, another one was a physicist at M.I.T. --Naturally... so all of our dads were these big shots and Mom was, like, Superwoman, but she didn't survive our delivery. I got sent to an orphanage while you were brought up in a tropical paradise by this scientist you do research for, but who doesn't actually pay you because you don't need money. Did I leave anything out? Julius ignores Vince's cynicism.You mean, all those geniuses who contributed to the... ... Sperm milkshake? *Do you know how many times I've heard stories like this? It's every orphan's fantasy: 'My real Mom and Dad were rich and beautiful, but there was a mix-up at the hospital and I got switched with another baby... But one day there's going to be a knock at the door and there they'll be with open arms, crying... \"My darling! My treasure! We didn't know! How can we make it up to you?\"' I'm telling you this for your own good, Julius. It's a crock. Vince goes over to a trunk, rummages in it, comes up with a dusty mouldering folder from which he removes a yellow- ing piece of paper.I liberated this from my file at the orphanage. Read it and weep. Julius takes the paper and reads aloud.That's right, Julius, she abandoned me.I don't know about your momma, Miss Perfect of 1952, but my momma was a slut, and if she's still alive, I hope she's in a lot of pain. She dumped me once -- no way she gonna get a chance to do it again --Julius -- slow down -- I've got no time for this. You go hunt down * Mom, I've got a cash flow problem * to deal with.What!Or else what? Suddenly, Vince's living room WINDOWS EXPLODE in a burst of GUNFIRE. Vince and Julius hit the floor and try to shield themselves from the SHATTERING GLASS. The sound of a CAR SQUEALING away outside the window.Sorry -- the car's been promised for a kid's charity.-- Uh... Webster -- calling from California. I happen to have some merchandise you might want --It's the amount of enrichment I want to talk about.Look, Beetroot -- if we can't renegotiate we wither and die. I'm not delivering any goddam Cadillac without knowing for sure I got twenty for my cut.I guess twenty seems a little high to you. I'm a reasonable guy -- I'll take fifteen -- McKINLEY Listen to me, you poor excuse for a warmed over turd, a deal's a deal ---- But -- CUT TO:I can do better than five here. McKINLEY If you can do better than five million dollars, take it! *F-five million dollars... He writes down the proper amount now: $5,000,000. Then he kisses the piece of paper.Beetroot?I'll see you in Houston -- after all, fair is fair. I'll just have to find it in my heart to live with your offer... Vince hangs up, jumps up and screams with joy. He puts the cassette in his pocket, crumples up the piece of paper, and sky-hooks it into the waste basket.Five million dollars!'Going back to Houston, Houston, Houston...' Vince tosses the items into the back seat of the Caddy, just as Julius jogs up the driveway and collapses against the Caddie door. He's red in the face, completely drenched with sweat, gasping for breath, having run all the way from Bel-Air.Jesus!You scared the living shit out of me --Great. Julius, in his fervor, grips Vince by the shoulders.Awww -- that's terrible. Vince removes Julius's hands, slides him away from the door, and opens it.Look, Julius, I'm in kind of a hurry. Sammy wants me to take the car to Houston. Much bigger bucks when you raffle for charity in Houston. Julius takes the map from Vince, looks at it.A lot of places are on the way to Houston. I'll be back in a few days. Stay in my apartment. Run up my phone bill. Throw wild parties. Take advantage of me.No we don't.You know -- you're right. This is fate -- destiny -- But there's no way I'm gonna drive for 1500 miles with you smelling like that --Why does everybody have to like me so much? Vince gets out of the car and, although it kills him, tries to put on a happy face for Linda.Oh please -- It's not my birthday anymore --Nowhere --Okay, okay -- look, you can't tell anybody this -- not even your sister -- but I'm onto something so huge it gives me a rash just thinking about it.I got something in here -- -- I don't even know what it is -- that's worth a fortune!I borrowed a cup of sugar from her once...No you're not.Okay, okay. Just don't let on to Julius. He thinks we're going to look up our ancestors, like in 'Roots' or something.This ought to fit you. Julius removes the shirt he borrowed from Vince, who pretends to be horrified at the sight of Julius's huge muscles.Whoa -- get away from that window! There's women and children out there! What is wrong with you?You allergic to something?What are those bumps doing all over your body? You're all swelled up. You look like you're about to explode.-- Are just born to be bad. It's you, Julius. Oooh, you are so scary...It's his first T-shirt.See if you can get us a room with a king-sized bed, okay? Linda smiles at him, and winks. Julius, misunderstanding the sleeping arrangements, leans out the window.Now promise me something.If this professor Traven says he's never heard of Mom, and us twins, and all our dads, and the experiment, I don't want you to be upset. -- Because this is entirely possible.Well, that's that. On to Houston. He leads a stunned Julius down the corridor, towards several armed security guards.Keep your voice down. This place is crawling with security -- *No... CUT TO:... How did you know my name?gazes at the \"blender\" we saw Traven demonstrating inThis must be where you made the milkshake...But instead of just one perfect kid, Mom had two of us -- way to go, Mom.Whoa -- I'm the crap?No, I want to hear this. I'm left-over crap? I'm no good?You tellin' me I'm a side effect!?!My life just got flushed down the toilet.I'm genetic garbage.* I know this is a touchy subject * for you, Julius. But the fact is, * we don't look the same -- we don't * act the same, we don't talk the * same -- we don't dress the same. *So how come if we're the same, we're so damn different. *Yeah?A family? You really think so?With like Thanksgiving dinner? And Christmas trees...Always?I'm not introducing you to my mother dressed like some goatsherder from Albania. You need some new clothes.Do I look like I need help? Here's the problem. Maybe I'll try on a couple of things myself.You look better, put it that way. We got to do something about the way you walk. You're moving a tad stiff, Jules. Ever see * Frankenstein?That's not gonna help. You got to walk like you're moving in time to music. I'm not talking about military marches now, I mean Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Archie Bell and the Drells and a couple of white * guys. *Like this... You just got to try to be cool, you know? Try these on.Everything Julius said was true. I'm the product of geniuses!Of course, but it's nice to make it official. JULIUS * Tommorrow we're going to finally meet our mother. VINCE * And tonight we celebrate!Talk to her, buy her some drinks, dance with her. Girls like to dance.I guess you haven't done that before either.Well -- forget all that disco shit, everyone's seen it. When I really want to romance a girl, I waltz with her.It turns them to putty in your hands.He shoves a chair out of the way, making a little room.Okay, come here, put your feet by my feet ---- I said put your feet by my feet not on my feet! -- Julius looks at his brother, then self-consciously takes his hands.I'll lead, you follow. Okay, one, two, three, turn... ... put your arm here -- you're breaking my fingers -- you're not wrestling a boar 300 miles south southwest of Fiji -- don't clench your teeth -- Vince begins to take Julius through the steps slowly at first, then as Julius gains confidence they begin to sail round the room, and we -- CUT TO:Well, you've learned to waltz. Now it's time to introduce you to the wonderful world of getting shit-faced. CUT TO:Well, we're going to change all that -- aren't we, Marnie? Julius, embarrassed, looks over at Marnie, who's smiling sweetly at him.Please excuse me -- my back teeth are floating.Piece of cake. You're nervous 'cause it's your first time. Perfectly natural.I was twelve and she was a nun -- that's real pressure. They both finish at the urinals and begin washing at the sink.I got to admit it, Jules -- since I met you, life is getting better all the time. Julius, a little smashed, can't hide his feelings. He grips Vince by the shoulders.Hey, cut it out! Not in here! Julius releases Vince, who clocks the other man's reaction.Go easy on the beer, okay?What are you talking about? We didn't shoot anybody.That's kind of drastic, don't you think?How many of those... rules do you have?I bet.Uh... we got cable TV, a fully stocked bar, free ice -- we're in great shape.I thought I'd just go and tuck Linda in for the night.Maybe read her a bedtime story. Don't wait up for me.Oh yes it does. TIME CUT TO:-- Eighteen -- nineteen --Julius gave me a few pointers -- -- Seventy-five -- seventy-six -- I don't need to exercise, but Mom's gonna see me for the first * time in thirty-five years, I wanna look my best.I know she will -- I have that effect on people -- -- One hundred and forty-three -- * one forty-four -- * -- I just hope she's not too disappointed in Julius -- he can't help how weird he seems at the start --Hey -- I sleep great every night -- -- what if she's disappointed in me?Five hundred. Don't want to overdo. He goes into her arms.You're right. I couldn't do this without you, Linda.Whoa! Move in together?I'm no good at playing house -- I'm grouchy in the morning, cranky in the afternoon, moody at night --Why don't we sleep on this, okay? I mean, I've got a big day tomorrow. It's gonna be great -- taking my best girl to meet my mom.There's nobody else, Linda, not anymore.Good idea. One bunch from me, one from Jules.Not to mention valuable -- real estate like this must be worth a fortune.You got me wrong -- I'm just saying it's nice Mom's loaded -- that's a worry she won't have to have in her old age. Julius smiles at Vince and rings the bell. A MALE CUSTODIAN answers the door -- friendly but very firm.We've come a long way. I can assure you she's going to be very happy to see us.Gotta be. Well, don't just stand there.That depends on how you feel personally about trespassing.Please don't do that -- look -- this isn't one of your average everyday situations -- she's our mother is the thing.Twin sons.We're kind of a surprise.We were right ---- Is Mary Ann?No, of course not.She's not famous anymore?But -- but you said she was here --Can we get the hell out of here?Do I look like a young artist to you, Linda?I know what she meant. And I know why she's here, too. It's got nothing to do with my mother and everything to do with money.Bull-shit. Julius, who's been quiet and distant throughout, suddenly intercedes.You hear that, everybody? The * creature from the black lagoon * just put in his two bits. I * should have my head examined for listening to you in the first place -- deal-of-a-lifetime opportunity and I'm driving around looking for a dead mother.Family, my butt. There's no family here. There's just me and three losers -- I'm leaving.Okay, Beetroot -- It's time. I'll be there tomorrow -- where do we meet and trade?I thought we had a deal here.This is what?Five million dollars --I trust you.No way... this is bullshit... Julius, you putz.Goddam ESP-psycho-voodoo bullshit...Put the goddam gun away -- you're a multimillionaire. CUT TO:hands held high, appears, stands beside Julius.I am never going to forgive you for this.I had escaped. I was on my way to Brazil -- when I felt you.Because, thanks to you, I'm now not only a godamn psychic, I've got this disease called a conscience!How am I going to survive out there? What are my friends going to think?Butt out, okay? This is family stuff, we're squabbling, it's personal, just take the money and go sit in the lap of luxury somewhere. Try Brazil.-- Hold it, don't I get a say in this? Webster points the shotgun at Vince, starts to squeeze the trigger when --You can be an irritating pain -- but sometimes you come in handy. -- Where'd you get the gun?You should have checked if he had a gun, chump.Ooooh -- you lied?Looks like you messed with the wrong people, wise guy.Duck? Duck? You are developing real style, Julius.Yeah, yeah, yeah.You're my brother, right? We're family, right?We're a rich family, right?Return the money?!? Are you nuts?!? This is dirty money, * Julius -- it doesn't belong to anybody ---- I won't -- I won't feel one bit better -- I'll never feel better, not if I live to be... oh no -- * As the sound of POLICE SIRENS get LOUDER we -- FADE TO BLACK.Linda, I --You wouldn't answer my calls or my letters, so I... Look, I made a terrible mistake and I apologize and I want to tell you that I'm a changed man. Linda is almost buying it, but then --Well, there was a window in the back that --All I ask is for another chance. I know I probably don't deserve it, but --I had to break into your apartment, but --So, do you forgive me? Linda hesitates.But? Vince looks at her, understands.You mean, that matter we talked about once and never really resolved.The matter of you and me living together.Your place or mine?What do we do? Most people on this planet cause problems -- the Benedict Corporation solves them. We're a consulting firm -- a think-tank -- sort of like the Rand Corporation -- only smarter! Tuesday at three. See you then.Just as long as they pay -- we're not running a charity, you know.Come in!Momma? Mary Anne nods.Sceaming in stereo.Not you, too -- It's not a competition, you know. They both start pushing their strollers again.Now that's a scary thought.
