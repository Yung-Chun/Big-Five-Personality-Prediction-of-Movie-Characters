{"Tamara-Drewe": {"NICHOLAS": {"raw_line": "Inchcombe had seen it all before. He'd seasoned it: the metallic smell of blood and gunshot; forensics hunched like vultures. The dreadful mundanity of murder, he thought.He approached Patel, who was stricken. She was one for whom a corpse was still an obscenity. Inchcombe realised a disturbing truth. His lack of feeling was almost...Pathological...In Ewedown? Nadia, what the ffff are you doing there? I haven't told her yet.I can't tell her just like that. It's twenty five years; a marriage.Of course I'm pleased... Nadia, go to the pub and stay there. I'll come when I can.Just give me a couple of hours - He ends the call just as Beth is nearing the door - panicking the phone back on to its holder.Cock pie. Beth opens the door to see Nicholas apparently hard at it.Good actually. Just about to embark on forensics.Reckon I might pack it in a bit early today. Need to think about my blood smears. Might take a drive; have a pint. Stir the old grey matter up.Judy. She says the Impala contracts should be through in a day or two.What?This is absolutely yummy.Yes but. What about the guests?But I'm supposed to be thinking, you know about the -Is that - I mean - are you wearing that?Just looks a bit... hot. Now Beth knows she is right. She takes her jacket off, gutted.You know, Haddition's always packed with pissed Londonites on a Friday. I doubt we'll get a table anyway. Let's do it properly next week; make an occasion. I'm always taking you for granted. I'm vile I know; you should kick me really, but - He's about to leave. Beth speaks calmly.What? For a moment, he tries to find a lie.Oh come on, Beth.Look, it's nothing. It's been once or twice, that's all. Beth, it's not anything. Beth is raw with pain.Just a researcher with Radio 4.Nadia, Nadia Patel. This hits a nerve.No, no I met her when I was on Desert Island Discs.Just the name.Yes but -I was going to tell you but - Beth utters an inchoate cry.Beth, I'm a ruin, I know - but I've been in a real state about this... I didn't want to hurt you. Another wounded cry from Beth.Can we talk calmly about this? There are people out there -For God's sake; we're surrounded byBeth, we're like a pair of compasses...Joined solidly at the top but with the ends able to roam, in freedom - His phone beeps.We've talked a lot about the creative mind and we agreed that it needs freedom to explore!Calm yourself down!Will you please -For heaven's sake.Beth... For a moment, she hopes he'll apologise.You're making fools of us both. Beth, tears stinging, picks a plant out of the tub by the door and hurls it, roots and all. It's a direct hit.I was busy. Rowing with my wife.Home.We could have gone on just as we were.Yes. In London. Now and then. Nadia looks at him. The scales are beginning to fall. They get in the car. As they drive away, Tamara's car pulls up. She gets out of the car and takes in the pub before entering.If that's the way you feel... Nadia, I'm devastated. Through the frosted window Glen sees Nicholas.But if that's your decision, I'll have to learn to live with it. Beth comes in from the garden. Glen sees Nicholas quickly end the call. For Beth's benefit:I told you. I love my wife. Don't ever phone me again. Glen is shocked by this duplicity.Beth...I'm sorry.I'm sorry.I hate myself. I hate myself. Glen opens the door a chink. They are feet away from him. Nicholas looks unshaven, shagged and guilty.Drove her back to London. Took all night.She was in a state.I'm sorry. Then Beth is sobbing too. They are in each other's arms, holding each other.I don't know why I'm like this. I couldn't do without you. Glen looks away from the clinch, horribly embarrassed. He opens the toilet window, puts the soap dish straight. Looks again - still hugging, sobbing, kissing - puts his hand on the flush - too awful to reveal himself - takes it off again. Straightens his hair, examines his teeth, sweating. He looks again. At last the emotion is abating. Nicholas releases Beth. She wipes her eyes.OK... Let's talk later.Has it?Me too. Beth goes. Nicholas is watching her; his expression strange. He walks away. At last Glen emerges, incredulous at Nicholas' lies.You've made it a wonderful home Beth.If you can't put this behind you, then we're stuck.What has to happen? I am sorry - Beth brings her arm up to push him away. Nicholas catches it; draws her to him. He kisses her insistently. Beth's resistance diminishes. Soon it has gone. We begin to see the depth of Beth's physical love for him. At that moment, Glen walks round the corner. He tries to backtrack, mortified by his intrusion on their passion. Too late. They part. Nicholas turns away in frustration.So has the muse shone on you, Greg?Oh yes. Of course we call them biscuits here.Sometimes wish I could get distracted. Ten page a day man, rain or shine.Well, Greg -I wouldn't presume to give an academic tips.Well. He's offended.How do I do it? I just get on with it, Greg. Nicholas walks away leaving Glen smarting. The female writers surround Nicholas. He tops them up, full of charm. Under his breath, Glen impersonates:To the muse, however you find her. He is looking at Beth. She is gratified. Then his eye shifts, his glass still in the air.Who's that? Tamara Drewe is climbing the stile at the bottom of the garden in a low cut T-shirt, tiny pair of denim shorts and bare feet. The evening light bathes her in a golden sheen.No it isn't.Good God. What's happened to her?She's completely different.Yes.Huh.Of course you won't.Because you're not desperate, are you? Always something a bit desperate about Tamara Drewe. Beth looks at him puzzled as he works on.Have you?What?Think it's time you went. Tamara is mortified.You're making yourself ridiculous. This really hurts. Tamara takes the bucket of soapy water and throws it over the car - and Nicholas.Oh, grow up.How goes the opus?I simply pander to popular taste.Just airport fodder... Glen at the foot of the table, finds this modesty rich.The real secret of being a writer is learning how to lie. A frisson of shock goes round the lady writers.Because that's what storytellers are. Thieves and liars...Fuck Soup.Hello, Penny. How's tricks? Penny is suddenly all coy.You're looking great. Terrific coat.You look like royalty.The famous Ben - Swipe, eh? Ben just about manages to shake it.It wasn't on Newsnight, no.She said yes? Nicholas can't hide his disbelief. Ben is insulted.I think the word is gobshite.What's that supposed to mean?That is ten pence psychology! You don't know what you're talking about, do you? He walks away. Beth is completely taken aback.Patel's eyes were open, eloquent in death... He looks up. In the distance, he can just see Tamara talking to Andy in the garden at Winnards Farm. Nicholas opens his desk. He finds a pair of old binoculars. He focuses them on Tamara. She holds out her hand with the ring on it. Andy has his arms wrapped around himself, his shoulders hunched. He nods, affecting congratulations. Nicholas tries to close in on Tamara. But she turns and goes indoors. Also the yellow Porsche arrives. Nicholas puts the binoculars down.He knelt down - forensics be damned - and closed her eyes, forever.Uh huh. Beth is on her way out. She turns and kisses him.Is that Claire with an `i'? Beth has a tray of mince pies. Glen is at her side.Oh, thank you for that...So I hear. You have my heartiest commiserations, Tara. He hands her the book dismissively. Tamara is smarting.Yes, We thought it'd be a good opportunity to catch up.Beth, you know what it's like. Judy's off to New York tomorrow. We can never find a window. Should be home around ten. He puts the phone down.What did you make of that email from Tamara?He's not up at Stonefield. Tamara is about to turn back.So what about this shag I've been reading about?I liked your email. Very succint.I'll come round tomorrow then. About three?I'll probably stay on at the library for another hour or two. Yes... just checking some law reports.Hello.You can tell me to leave. Tamara says nothing.You can throw me right out. Nicholas slowly takes his red scarf and coat off. He hangs them on a coat hook, bringing himself closer to her.Just say and I'll go. She still can't speak. Nicholas takes her in his arms. He is big and fatherly and comforting. Tamara feels a sense of relief, of not being alone. Her arms go around him. When he kisses her, he's surprisingly real, vulnerable even, as if he's left his lordly persona at the door. Tamara closes her eyes. Their kisses become more urgent.Are you crying?Don't cry. Am I really that bad? Tamara shakes her head, glad of him.Yes you are. She looks up at him.You're relentlessly, rudely, uncompromisingly yourself. A smile appears on Tamara's face.Is that why you're crying?Am I here as revenge on your ex?Because... since you climbed over that stile in the summer I haven't thought about very much else. She doesn't believe him.When can we do this again?Look, Beth and I have this kind ofThursday?Bloody terrible. Didn't move till well past Chiswick. But look, I nipped into Fortnums... He hands her a package.Maybe I will... Nicholas goes to the table. The writers greet him as he sits.Sorry everybody; traffic was a pig. Do carry on...That sounds very innovative...Geoff.Henry James.That's right, a Hardy book. Coming well?Jolly good. He goes. Beth is ashamed of his condescension.Shush. This is brutally candid. You lay yourself completely bare.Seriously. It's very moving. Tamara knows this is praise indeed. She is deeply gratified.So... have I done my duty?Now do I get my treat? Tamara, almost in his arms, is crestfallen.Arse biscuits.What's he doing here?Off-chance of what?Shit salad. He gets out his phone. Jody and Casey are in the trees watching, satisfied.Yes, it's a frightful bore.You're a marvel. See you soon.Who cares? He kisses her, passionately. She is troubled but eventually responds. Jody nudges Casey.You're a marvel. Cheers. He kisses her and prepares to leave. She is suspicious.Oh, don't. You hate festivals.It's completely boring. You'll hate it. Stay here. Her suspicion will stay silent no longer.Like what? Nicholas attacks; the best form of defence.God, it's like living with the effing moral police. Are you ever going to trust me? He goes.Cock pie. Has he told Beth?Well, I suppose it has to come out sometime.It's a good thing. Feels like a relief. Means you and I can start to think about our plans. For the future...I know it's been hard, sharing me with Beth. But I'm yours now. I'm going to leave her. I want a new life - and I want it now. With you. Tamara is appalled. A minder interrupts.It all runs very smoothly. I start a book in the summer, publish it the following spring. Bit of a factory, really.There won't be a next one. Frankly I'm sick to death of Inchcombe. In fact, I'm about to kill him off. There's a gust of dismay in the crowd, as though a real death has been announced.Yes, but I'm moving on to fresh pastures.Inchcombe will be meeting a very sticky end. And it's one murder I'm really looking forward to.Madam, what a saucy question!Because she lets me. Beth takes this like a blow. Even Tamara is shocked by it.You're right. I can't go on using her, lying to her. Won't be fun but I've got to do it.I don't feel alive with Beth! I haven't been living for years. She's had me smothered in a comfy blanket -But... I'm in love with you.No. You can't end it. Tamara - Fuck supper!My God, you're cold hearted.You don't feel a thing, do you?There's someone else isn't there...Not that narcissist drummer?It's that ignorant lunk isn't it? That muscle-bound wastrel Andy Cobb.Thank you.Excuse me. Nicholas is standing in the doorway, looking grey.May I speak with my wife? Glen releases Beth.It's over.Beth - I finished it. She's been chasing me; this wild crush -There's something desperate about her, something almost unhinged -Beth...Don't. You can't.Oy! Greg! I want a a word with you.You fucking devious bastard.You think I haven't noticed how you've been worming your way in? You keep your hands off my wife, you low-rent pedant.I want you out of my house.And I fucking pay for it. I've given Beth all this. What can you give her?Obscure literary shit not worth tenBeth'll come to her senses. You need an income to run Stonefield. And mine's bigger than yours! Glen nuts him. Nicholas slips backwards in the mud. He whacks his skull on the sharp, rusting corner of the trough. He falls to the ground. Glen is astonished at his own prowess.", "clean_line": "inchcombe seen seasoned metallic smell blood gunshot forensics hunched like vultures dreadful mundanity murder thought approached patel stricken

As she drives away, we see Nadia sitting outside the pub in her urban heels, anxiously smoking a cigarette.Big glass of rioja please. And I need a room.Don't know. Just one. Zoe pours the wine. She's disarmingly friendly.No. Business of a kind.I'm from here. Sort of.My mum's house is just up the road.She's. She died. Zoe finishes pouring the wine.Andy, you moron; it's me. Andy looks more closely. A disturbing spark of recognition.Then help me!What sort of work, graphics?You're a gardener? Andy says nothing. He stares at her nose. Glen has come in.Would you like to buy it?Yes.Andy if you want it, why don't you make me an offer?Unlucky. Tamara opens a cupboard. It's full of empty wine bottles.You stupid prick. Andy looks at her. She is sincere.You first.Fuck off. She kisses him. As they start to make love:I love you. Fuck off. I love you.Hello. Sorry to intrude. Her hand defensively brushes her nose. Poppy walks towards her, full of warmth.Poppy, how are you?Thanks. It isn't actually new; just smaller...Thank you...I'll have to. There's so much to be done.Actually, I was going to ask if you could spare a pair of strong arms. I've got a skip coming tomorrow and -Well thank you. You're very kind... Is Andy around at all? Beth is helping Nicholas wipe his trousers.Changing my face is the best thing I ever did. And I don't care what anyone thinks.Maybe; if you did the wrinkles too.No... But it feels right. My first novel's definitely going to be autobiographical.Ideally, I'd like to make it into fiction before I'm thirty.What?You know before I got the nose job I had no trouble getting taken seriously. Maybe, when they removed that bit of cartilage, they pulled my brain out by mistake - what do you think? Glen smiles, won over.Beaky?... We see her stricken face as she turns away. Then she turns back and hits Andy. His nose streams blood.Boys know nothing. Nicholas looks up at her, smiles indulgently. Tamara stops work.I've been reading `Inchcombe's Dose.'The bit where Doctor Inchcombe finds himself having thoughts about the dead guy's daughter. Tamara walks around the car, bringing her polishing cloth closer to his.You describe her light smattering of freckles and her striking profile. So... She turns her head.Who did you base her on?Have you noticed me? Nicholas looks at her in surprise.Because I've noticed you...Nicholarse.Pretty direct isn't he? He's not even bought her a coke. Andy turns. Sees her.And he stinks.That's disturbing human.I wish. Looks like I'm stuck here for a while. Actually, I've got a proposition for you. Andy glances at the goats; bad idea.So we can reminisce about how I smashed your nose?Yes I did.I've got to do the house up before I sell it. It looks like an eighties timewarp. Would you like the job? He just looks at her.Painting it and tidying the garden? Good hourly rate.What d'you mean?I'm fine.Jesus Christ, the goats are givingThat's very sweet of you Andy -So... is that a yes? Andy doesn't reply.Come on, goat whisperer - I thought I'd be doing you a favour. I thought you needed the work. It's all over with Ingrid and Darcy.She's had a shit time but she'll still call him. He'll lose her number. He won't ring her back... Andy's face cracks into a smile. He is won over.What would you choose for in here?Make it.Hello. I'm Tamara Drewe.I'm supposed to be interviewing you - for the Independent. She smiles sweetly, smoothing his hair.It was scheduled for later but maybe now's a better time...Hi Boss.To indie drummers? Maybe. Who are your influences, Ben?I'm selling. D'you want it?Would you like a beer?Who? Tamara opens the fridge. Ben is inches away. He still hasn't kissed her and he's just about to.You write all the songs; that's pretty rare for a drummer.You mean you don't spontaneously combust?I'm just starting something.Not the column. Just stuff coming out. Don't want to stop it.What's this?Ben... For which finger?So what's the ring saying, Ben?I didn't know.That you were in love with me.You're the best fun in the world. I'd love to marry you. She throws her arms around his neck.Can I say it then?I love you. Tamara holds him, profoundly affected. Something akin to fear flickers across Ben's eyes. The phone rings.It's a shame it doesn't fit. Perhaps you should have taken one of mine with you when you went to buy it.So... when did you buy it?Was this for someone else? Ben shrugs, not wanting to admit. The truth dawns.You gave it to Fran didn't you?You asked her to marry you...?Do you?It's kind of research; I want to write about them. They're funny, Ben - come on. They move through the crowd.Besides, I want to show you off.More like arm fungus with that face on. Ben, meet Glen. Glen, meet Ben, my fiance.Uh huh.I knew you'd be pleased.Wait.Sorry. She flashes a smile at the Army Geek and puts her copy down in front of Nicholas.Could you do it for Ben? He's my fiance. We're getting married in the summer.Well merry Christmas. Nicholarse. She turns away.Because... I've started writing.But this is proper. Not just stuff for the paper. 'It's about my teens - and is working for me here.Of course I'm with you...Hang on...I don't know; the shed... What do you think?Really?Well then. Keep it... Andy puts the phone down, grinning. Tamara is grinning too, sharing the same memory.How many times? I didn't send it! Are you listening to me? BEN! WILLWhy don't you believe me? I didn't write that email.Is this about Fran?She's the reason you don't trust me. Just because she fucked around on you it doesn't mean that I will. Ben, furious, starts drumming again. Tamara boiling with frustration, walks away.I wasn't pissed, or depraved orCan you go to the farm? Just take a look, see if anyone's been in.Thank you. Ben's really pissed off. He's massively got the hump - Ben appears from the other end of the large room.Got to go. Sorry. She puts the phone down.I've just asked him to go and check over the farm -What?He wouldn't do that.No way!There is no way Andy would do that! Ben pulls his jacket on.He hasn't done anything.Ben - where are you going? Don't go!I'm looking for Andy.Oh fuck off.Well I didn't send it. And I wouldn't shag you if you were the last man left after a nuclear winter.Drop dead you smug prick. Nicholas watches her storm back up the copse.So. Nicholas. She lets the door fall open. She backs into the hall. Nicholas walks in. He closes the door. They look at each other. Neither of them moves.No. Nicholas is taken aback. He instinctively holds her.I'm just not myself.I used to watch you out of my window helping your daughter learn to skateboard up the lane. Bit of an obvious crush, wasn't it.No.I don't know why you're here. Why are you here, Nicholas?You can use me in one of your books.What about Beth?Bullshit.Isn't life complicated enough? Nicholas shakes his head. He kisses her.Is it any good? Because I keep -I'm well-known for it.Thank you.Admirably.You are so cheesy. Tamara is staring at him with something akin to distaste.Andy... Behind the railings, the girls can't help their look of disappointment at seeing her alive.I've had my head down, writing.I'd love to, but...I can't... I'm kind of on one with my writing. Over her shoulder, Andy sees Nicholas' red scarf and coat hanging on the coat hook. He hides his shock. Tamara is unaware that he has seen.Can we do it soon though? I'd really like to; just not right now. He nods at her in disbelief.He just came on the off-chance.He wants to know about roofing for the shed...Nicholas, someone knows. Maybe weAndy? Andy emerges. Tamara smiles tentatively.Hey. How are you? Andy says nothing.Would you like to have that drink? I could do with a friend / at the moment and -I'm not going to split them up. It'sIt's none of your bloody business.Shut up!Andy Cobb has rumbled us.I don't know. But he might. And I wouldn't blame him.Does it?Nicholas?...It's got to stop, Nicholas.Nicholas, listen to me. She makes him look at her.We had fun. But it's wrong. And it's over.I'm sorry. Nicholas looks as if he's just been punched.Will you keep it down?Please don't shout.I do feel. I feel like I'm blazing away inside all the time. Why do I do these things? What am I doing with you? The question hangs between them.Oh for God's sake.Goodbye.Andy Cobb is a far better man than you! In saying it, Tamara realises it's true. She walks away. Nicholas bends almost double in pain, letting out a great moan from the soul. A fan has been waiting at a respectful distance. He approaches. Nicholas numbly takes his book. Instead of signing, he tears it to pieces. He hands the tatters back to the fan.Ben...Ben?It was you? Jody can't look her in the eye.Ben. She takes the ring out of the jar and puts it in his hand.I'm in love with someone else. At that moment, Casey appears at the back door.Beth - no -Beth. Don't. Tamara is running towards Beth. She cannot bear her to see. She throws her arms around her, protecting her.Don't look. Don't look... It is too late. Beth is seeing the corpse. A great wave of shock hits her. Tamara holds her tight, trying to contain it. Another great wave of shock.You'll get to it through Byley farm. His skull is broken. It's smashed. No I haven't but... it's obvious. His wife. Yes she is. Thank you. Thank you. I will. Beth has turned Nicholas over. She is washing the mud from his face with water from the trough.They're on their way... Beth seems totally closed off. Tamara gingerly approaches. She touches Beth's shoulder.Beth? Help is coming - Beth cannot bear to be touched. Her hand involuntarily flies out. It slams into Tamara's face. Tamara steps back. Her nose is broken, pouring blood.It's broken! - She gasps, riding the pain, knowing she deserves it. It's the biggest wake-up call of her life. Beth stares at her, at first astonished at what she has done - then satisfied. Tamara stumbles away.I'm sorry. She starts crying bitter tears.I don't want to be with Ben. She looks back at Andy. He begins to understand. She walks off.Don't say anything.You did it on purpose, didn't you?Made it so beautiful I'd never be able to leave.So you were. They are at the threshold. They kiss.Welcome home.", "clean_line": "dump drives away nadia sitting outside pub urban heels anxiously smoking cigarette big glass rioja need room know zoe pours wine disarmingly friendly business
