{"Fault-in-Our-Stars-The": {"HAZEL": {"raw_line": "You have a choice in this world, I believe, about how to tell sad stories.On the one hand, you can sugar coat - the way they do in movies and romance novels.Where villains are vanquished and... heroes are born and... - \"Perfect\" Hazel and \"Perfect\" Gus kiss in a dark room.... beautiful people learn beautiful lessons...... and nothing is too messed up that can't be fixed with an apology and a Peter Gabriel song.I like that way as much as the next girl, believe me. It's just not the truth.This is the truth. And EVERYTHING GOES BLACK. We HEAR:Sorry.Late in the Winter of my 17th year...... my mother decided I was depressed.I'm not depressed.I'm not depressed.I'm not depressed!The booklets and web sites always list depression as a side effect of cancer...Depression's not a side effect of cancer...... it's a side effect of dying.Which is what was happening to me.Why stop there?Keep `em coming. I can take it. I'm like the Keith Richards of cancer kids. The Doctor looks at Frannie who just shakes her head.I'm not sure it's for me.What?\"Journey?\" Really?I'll spare you the gory details of Patrick's ball cancer. Basically, they found it in his nuts, cut most of it out, he almost died, but he didn't die, and now here he is - divorced, friendless, addicted to video games, exploiting his cancertastic past in the heart of Jesus - \"literally\" - to show us that one day - if we're lucky - we could be just like him. They all say:I'm, uh, Hazel. 16.You mean besides the terminal cancer?Alright? I guess...? Isaac tries not to laugh at this. Hazel sits back down.Hmm?Why don't you guys go to a movie?You haven't been out in a while. Go. Have fun. Take the night off. Frannie and Michael look at one another again.And that was my life. - Hazel watching TV, book in hand. - Hazel in another doctor's office. - Hazel popping pills.Reality shows. Doctor's appointments. Eight prescription drugs, three times a day.And worse worse worst of all... support group.Ugh. You can't make me.If you want me to be a teenager, don't send me to Support Group. Buy me a fake ID so I can go to clubs and drink gimlets and take pot.See, that's the kind of thing I would know with a fake ID.And so I went... Frannie's car pulls up close to the back entrance.Not because I wanted to or because I thought it would help. But for the same reason I did anything these days... Hazel, oxygen tank in toe, gets out of the car with Frannie's assistance.... to make my parents happy.Are you gonna sit here and wait the whole time?Ok.Love you too Mom.The only thing worse than biting it from cancer - is having a kid bite it from cancer. As Frannie gets back in the car, she shouts to her daughter:I'll take the stairs. The KID nods. The doors shut. Hazel is reminded - it could always be worse. She turns to go, walking right into:Excuse me. With the Beautiful Boy watching, a wan smile on his face, Hazel shuffles off as fast as she can, ducking into:I just wanna say... there will come a time when, you know, all of us are dead. Gus is now even more fixed on her than before.It might be tomorrow. Might be a million years from now but... it's gonna happen. And when it does, enough generations will come and go, there'll be no one left to remember Cleopatra. Or Mozart. Or Muhammad Ali, let alone any of us, right? The look on Gus's face is unreadable.Oblivion's inevitable. And if that scares you, well, I suggest you ignore it. God knows it's what everyone else does. A beat. And then an enormous smile spreads across Gus's face, not a flirty smile but a surprised one, a real one. CUT TO:Someone should probably tell him, don't you think? Jesus? Seems kinda dangerous keeping all these kids with cancer in your heart. Gus laughs.Hazel.What?Why are you looking at me like that?What's with the \"always?\"He's gotta be hurting her boob.Oh. Um. Uh... Sure. Yeah. I'm... pretty free thisWhat?What do you mean \"now?\"You could be an axe murderer.Oh my god. Oh. My. God. You're kidding right? You just ruined the whole thing!What, you think that's cool? Oh you idiot! There's always a hamartia, isn't there? And yours is - even though you had FREAKING CANCER you give money to a corporation for the chance to acquire EVEN MORE CANCER!? Ugh. And you were doing so well. As she rants, Gus continues to look at her with that smile on his face. Hazel does not find it so amusing.Let me tell you... not being able to breathe? Sucks. Totally sucks.A fatal flaw. Gus takes a beat and then moves to face her, the smile still etched on his face.Sorry?Metaphor. Gus holds her gaze. And it's at this point Frannie pulls up.Can't tonight. I've made plans with Augustus Waters. And with that, she walks off. Frannie looks at the boy with the cigarette in his mouth. This could be trouble. Or awesome. Or both. And we CUT TO:You don't say.I'm surprised you have a license.Aha. Cancer perk.I was 13 when they found it. And as she speaks, we see it unfold. SMASH CUT TO:Stage IV thyroid cancer.I had surgery first.Then Radiation... - Having her head shaved by Frannie.Then Chemo... - With a PICC line in a chemo chair.All of which worked for a while. - A RADIOLOGIST looks at an X-ray. He's not pleased.And then stopped working. - 14-Year Old Hazel lies in bed, struggling to breathe. Frannie runs her fingers through her hair. Dad calls 9-1-1.And then my lungs started filling up with water. - In the ICU, her parents standing over her.That should have been the end.But it wasn't.The antibiotics kicked in. They drained the fluid from my lungs. And in time I got better. Stronger.I even found myself in an experimental trial. You know the ones that are famous in the Republic of Cancervania for not working. - A SECOND RADIOLOGIST examines a second X-ray.It's called Phalanxifor. Didn't work in over 70 percent of patients but, for some reason... The Radiologist looks surprised....it worked in me. They called it \"The Miracle.\" And finally, BACK TO:Tumors shrank, my mets have hardly grown since...Of course my lungs still suck but, theoretically, they could continue to suck in just this way for, I dunno, a while maybe.Yeah.Can't.Got my GED.It's just... Hazel.Nice to meet you! They walk down the carpeted stairs - Gus having an easier time with his one leg than Hazel is with her oxygen tank and weak lungs. Eventually they arrive at Gus's basement bedroom. There's a TV with a video game console, a few band posters, and a whole host of basketball memorabilia Gus sees her looking at them.Must have been pretty good.Need to sit. Gus sits down next to her on the bed.Don't get any ideas. All that standing... and stairs... and then more standing... lotta standing for me.I'll be fine in a minute. Unless I faint. I'm a bit of a Victorian lady, fainting-wise. Gus smiles. He waits for her breathing to slow down. In time:I already told you my story. I wasUm...No. I'm just... I don't know... un- extraordinary.\"An Imperial Affliction.\"It's a novel. My favorite novel.Seriously?It's not, it's... kind of my bible actually.Cancer. But not in that way, trust me. The guy who wrote it, Peter Van Houten, he's... well, the only person I've ever come across who seems to a) understand what it's like to be dying and b) not have died.Not so much cold as under- oxygenated.By \"it\" do you mean herpes? Frannie rolls her eyes. Hazel's phone buzzes. She excitedly checks it - only to be disappointed. Frannie notices.I'm not worried. Please. It's not like I'm waiting for him to call or anything. I just... we hung out. No big deal. Frannie says nothing to that. Her silence says it all. Hazel rolls her eyes. CUT TO:Welcome to the sweet torture of reading \"An Imperial --\" At which point she hears a loud WAIL coming from the other end of the phone.What the -- are you ok?How ya doing Isaac? Again, no response. Hazel looks to Gus for an explanation.Oh I'm sorry.Fair enough.I actually think his response is appropriate.You're quoting my book! Gus winks at her. At which point, Isaac lets out another howl. Gus gestures for Hazel to sit. The two of them flank Isaac. He finally speaks.Sometimes people don't understand the promises they're making when they make them.I know, right?It is rather abrupt.But that's part of what I like about it. It portrays death truthfully. You die in the middle of your life, in the middle of a sentence. But I do - God, I do want to know what happens to everyone else.The Dutch Tulip Man...I've written letters. He's never responded. Apparently he moved to Amsterdam, became a recluse. Hasn't published anything. Doesn't do interviews.Hello Augustus.What we need is a sequel.That's what I kept asking Van Houten for in my letters.That's correct.Yeee-up.Unfortunately so. Gus clears his throat, smiles. Hazel waits.Augustus!?Keep reading, keep reading!You're making this up?Holy hell.Can I... would you mind...\"Dear Mr. Peter Van Houten, my name is Hazel Grace Lancaster. My friend Augustus Waters, who read your book - at my recommendation - just received an email from you at this address. I hope you will not mind that he shared that email with me.\"\"I was wondering if you wouldn't mind answering a few questions I have about what happens after the end of the book. Specifically, the\"Does Anna's Mom marry the Dutch Tulip Man; is the Dutch Tulip Man up to something - or is he just misunderstood? What happens to Anna's friends? - Watching TV. Their bodies almost touching. But not quite.Lastly, I was hoping you could shed some light on Sisyphus the Hamster. These questions have haunted me for years. And I don't know how long I have left to get answers to them.\" And finally, back in Hazel's bedroom. She finishes reading this letter into the phone.\"I know these are not important literary questions and that your book is full of important literary questions, but I would just really like to know.\" INTERCUT w/ Gus bouncing a ball against the wall, listening.\"And of course, if ever you do decide to write anything else, even if you don't want to publish it, I'd love to read it. Frankly, I'd read your grocery lists. Yours with great admiration, Hazel Grace Lancaster. Age 16.\"You think?Is it really almost 1?I gotta get to sleep.Ok... Neither one of them want to hang up the phone.Ok... They both laugh at this.Ok.Ok. Gus hangs up. We stay with Hazel. Is it really possible this Beautiful Boy likes her? She thinks about it. She's not convinced. CUT TO:Yeah.Qualities of a Good Nurse. Go.Gets blood on the first try.\"I'm gonna stab you with this needle now, so there might be a little ouchie.\" They laugh and then lapse into silence for a moment.You doing alright, Isaac?It's a little crazy.Was he? Isaac exhales as the pain pump starts to kick in.The pain? Good. Good, Isaac. What about Gus? But Isaac is already asleep. Whatever he was going to say about Gus is gone. Hazel nods, pats his hand. CUT TO:Holy shit!\"Should ever you find yourself in Amsterdam, do pay a visit at your leisure. Yours most sincerely, Peter Van Houten\" Son of a - WHATNothing. Sorry.Everything! Look! Hazel shows Frannie the note. Frannie reads it.Can we go to Amsterdam? Please? Frannie thinks about how to respond for a beat.Mom, no. Please. Don't do anything. Forget I mentioned it. A beat between them. Frannie walks out, sadly. Hazel sits on the bed, totally bummed now for two reasons.Guilt is definitely a side effect of cancer.I've used it already. Pre- \"Miracle.\"I was 13...I met Goofy...Why are you embarrassed?Wait, what? The word \"crush\" has taken Hazel totally by surprise.Gus?You ready Gus? Hazel appears, silencing her Father mid-sentence. CUT TO:Is this where you bring all your romantic conquests?You're not a virgin. Are you really? Gus picks a STICK up from the dirt. Draws a BIG CIRCLE in it.He sounds Dutch.Let me guess --You do love your symbols.It has crossed my mind.I was thir--Sorry. Please, continue...But I... didn't save it. Gus smiles.Are you saying --Wait a minute.Cause I'd totally kiss you either way. And kiss him she does. He's surprised. And when it's over, they sit back, look at one another. A magic moment.Seriously... why are you doing this?He's not a stranger.Don't be gross.Can we at least ask Dr. Maria?You said the PET scan was encouraging!They have doctors in Amsterdam. And cancer. Someone will know what to do.So you'll come too.The Genies can hook it up. They're loaded.You've never been to Amsterdam, have you Mom? And judging from her face, seems she'd kinda like to. Dr. Maria looks at Frannie, shrugs - kid's got a point. Hazel smiles. And on that smile, we SMASH CUT TO:And then this happened.People talk about the courage of cancer patients. And I do not deny that courage... He leaves the room to do so and Fran stays behind, rocking with her daughter, promising her it'll all be ok. Whatever nightmare this is, it's going to end. CUT TO:I'd been poked and stabbed and poisoned for years and still I trod on.But make no mistake... The doctors rally to assist the screaming, crying child. She's wheeled away from her family who can only watch. We stay with her and WE HEAR:In that moment I would have been very, very happy to die.Hi.So what happened?Um, I feel like I'm not the most qualified person to answer that.Can't I just get like a lung transplant or something? The Doctors look at one another like \"who wants to take that one?\" Eventually:I have a question.Can I still go to Amsterdam? Dr. Simmons can't help himself. He laughs. Everyone looks at him. He clears his throat.Why not?Why not, Dr. Simmons?So does going to the mall --They have oxygen on airplanes.It's my life, right?I have this opportunity I may never have again. If the medicine's working, I don't see why --Hi Augustus.Kind of.I don't know. I want to go to Amsterdam. And I want him to tell us what happens after the book and I don't want my particular life and also the sky is making me sad and there's this old swing set that my Dad made for me when I was a kid. It's just... everything. Hazel is on the verge of losing it again. A few beats of silence pass by.Thanks for coming over.It's not about Amsterdam. It's about me. It's about...Exactly.\"Lonely, Vaguely Pedophilic Swing Set Seeks Butts of Children.\" Gus laughs.No? Gus laughs harder. Hazel laughs with him.Of course I like him.It's complicated.\"Dear Hazel, I have received word via the Genies that you will be visiting us with Augustus Waters and your mother beginning on the 4th. A week away! Peter and I are delighted and cannot wait to -- Hazel is confused. She stands and walks into the hallway.Mom? No response.Mom!Sorry, I... I didn't know you were in the shower.Did you ever call the Genies to tell them the trip is off? I just got an email from Peter Van Houton's assistant. She still thinks we're coming. Frannie purses her lips and squints past Hazel. Clearly unsure what to say.What? Frannie can't keep a straight face.Really...One week, lungs. Keep your shit together one more week...Amsterdam!For what? Michael lets go of her and wipes away his tears. They look at each other. Unable to help himself, he grabs her for another hug. Hazel lets him, laughing.Mom?Ok...?Ok. Frannie doesn't know what to make of any of that. She just says, when they stop and look at her:Amsterdam!Oh that's not necessary. But they give up their seats anyway. Hazel and Gus take them. We see various Passengers watching. Hazel ignores the attention until a LITTLE GIRL appears.It's called a Cannula. These tubes give me oxygen and help me breathe. The GIRL'S MOTHER swoops in, a little frantic.I dunno. Wanna try? Hazel removes her cannula and let's the Little Girl try it.Right?Well... I'd love to give you my cannula but... I kinda really need the help. The Little Girl nods, hands it back to Hazel, who quickly reattaches it.I think that's us.Have you never been on a plane before? Gus shakes his head, he has not. And he's nervous. He pulls a cigarette out of his pocket and puts it in his mouth. Within seconds a FLIGHT ATTENDANT rushes over.It's a metaphor. He puts the killing thing in his mouth but doesn't give it the power to kill him.Ok? Gus doesn't say it back. Hazel laughs.This is what it feels like to ride in a car with you. Gus grabs Hazel's hand as the plane lifts off. He looks out the window - they're flying! - and then back to Hazel.We're just friends, Mom.Something like that. Meanwhile, the landscape outside is flat and dusty, with dirt tracks and the occasional concrete building. In other words, it looks more like Indianapolis than Holland.This is Amsterdam?Good morning.How was the park?Mom!What do you mean?Mom...A 16 year old girl running free with an older boy on the streets of a foreign city famous for its vice and debauchery... is totally cool with you. Is that what you're saying?Ok. They clink glasses and sip.Wow that's good.Thank you for letting me hijack your wish.Oh my god.I mean...There are no words. Meanwhile, down on the water a BOAT passes, filled with merry, drinking LOCALS. One of them raises a glass to them and says something in Dutch.I like your suit.That isn't the suit you wear to funerals?It's your death suit.I have one of those. Bought it for my 15th birthday. Don't think I'd wear it on a date, though.Watch it. Gus winks. CUT TO: LATER. Dessert on the table. As they euphorically eat:Maybe.Undecided.No. Well...Really?Maybe there is no point.I hope you're right.Van Houten will get it. Trust me. There are like fifty Magritte references in \"Imperial Affliction.\"Exactly.No it's not. It's a drawing of a pipe. See?Why is the sky blue?I'm so excited I can barely breathe.Trash?Um, no thanks.Yes. We - well, Augustus, he made meeting you his Wish so that we could come here and talk to you. Van Houten says nothing. Takes a long pull on his drink.Kinda.We have some questions --About what happens, you know... after... the end of your book. Specifically to those who Anna leaves behind. Like her Mom, the Dutch Tulip Man, Sisy --I would say... limited?I'm sorry, sir. We don't speak Swedish.So anyway... when the book ends, Anna's mom --Can we please, maybe, talk about Anna for a sec? I mean, I understand that the story ends mid- sentence because she dies or she becomes too sick to continue --- but that doesn't mean her family and everyone she loves doesn't have a future, right?Mr. Van Houten, you said you would tell us what happens and that's why we're here. We... I need you tell me. Surely you've thought about it. I mean, as characters --They can't! (again, has to calmI don't want your pity --Hey listen douchepants. You're not gonna tell me anything I don't already know about illness. I need one thing and one thing only from you before I walk out of your life and that's for you to tell me what happens to your goddman characters!Bullshit!Make something up. ... Hazel smacks it right the fuck out of his hands, surprising everyone. After a beat:You're really not gonna tell us?Go fuck yourself. Van Houten doesn't have a response to that. He just shuts the door. And when he does, that's when Hazel gets emotional.I spent your Wish on that asshole.I wanted...Oh, um, that's alright.I can do it.I can do it! Hazel is not going to stand for any more disappointments today. They are going inside. CUT TO:What?Oh get over yourself. Hazel kisses him again. Now he tries to pull her shirt off but it gets tangled in with her oxygen tube. He can't figure it out. Eventually the whole thing is hilarious to them. They shake their heads - laughing - certainly not your typical Hollywood movie moment. And yet, for them:I love you, Augustus Waters.\"Get up you fat bastard.\"I said \"get up.\"God, what an asshole. They both giggle at the whole thing.It was awful, Mom. You can't imagine.Then we went to the Anne Frank museum.We just... walked around. Hazel and Gus smile, thoroughly in love but trying to keep it in check in front of her Mother.That was weird. Gus doesn't respond except to say:Augustus?Oh no... Gus takes the cigarette out of his mouth, clenches his teeth tightly, trying not to cry.Oh god.Oh my god no! Hazel loses it in that moment, falling on top of him, hugging him for dear life, her head in his lap.I'm so sorry, Augustus. I'm so soIt's so unfair --It's so fucking unfair! A beat. Gus still trying not to cry.Does it hurt?Ok.I'm just... I'm very fond of you. He grabs her hand and holds it.I don't think you're dying, Augustus. You've just got a touch of cancer. Gus nods. Squeezes her hand.Gus had a recurrence.You're not gonna say it?The usual. \"Everything happens for a reason...\" Michael shakes his head.How are your eyes?What are you talking about?It would be an honor. They hold holds.How's your love life? Anything from Monica?She hasn't even like, texted to ask how you're doing? He shakes his head. Gus gets an angry look on his face.That is so messed up!How do you even know that?Ok now what? Gus smiles. CUT TO:Woo hoo! Isaac grabs for ANOTHER EGG. Throws it. Then ANOTHER. He's a throwing machine. Most of them miss but at least he's enjoying himself. Finally there's a DIRECT HIT on the car door, triggering the alarm. Isaac pauses.A few days later, Gus landed in the hospital with chest pains.How's he doing?What about the chemo?Can I see him?If you don't mind, I'll just hang for a while. Mrs. Waters nods, hugs her again, walks out through the heavy doors towards Gus's room. Hazel sits in the chair. Same chair Gus sat in while waiting for her. They've switched places.What are you thinking about?Augustus...You are.I do know what you mean, I just... I don't agree. Hazel stands up, anger building.This obsession with beingBut I am mad!You think the only way to live a meaningful life is for everyone to love you, for everyone to remember you. Well guess what, Gus, this is your life. This is all you get. You get me, and your family, and this world. And if that's not enough, well I'm sorry, but it's not nothing. Cause I'll remember you, I'll love you --And I just wish... I just wish you'd be happy with that.It's not over yet, you know. Gus nods. Of course it isn't. And yet they both know there isn't much time. CUT TO:Hello?What?I think it's infected... Hazel feels his forehead, he's burning up.Gus, what the -- why are you here? Why aren't you home? Gus throws up. He doesn't even have the energy to turn his mouth away from his lap.Oh, sweetie...I can't fix this. I have to call someone. I'm sorry.I wish I could say Augustus Waters kept his sense of humor till the end, did not for a moment waiver in his courage and his spirit soared like an eagle to the sky......but that is not what happened. LATER. An EMT loads Gus into the back of an AMBULANCE. Hazel is allowed to ride with him in the back. As the car starts moving, Gus grabs her hand.Read you something?I know one.\"The Red Wheelbarrow\" by William Carlos Williams. \"So much depends / upon / a red wheel / barrow / glazed with rain / water / beside the white / chickens.\"No of course not. Um... what else...So much depends upon this observer/ of the universe... As Gus is drifting off to sleep, WE HEAR:One of the less bull-shitty conventions of the cancer genre is the convention known as the \"Last Good Day...\"This is where the victim of cancer finds himself unexpectedly with some hours...... when it seems like the inexorable decline has suddenly plateaued, when the pain is for a minute bearable.The problem, of course, is that there's no way of knowing that your last good day is your \"Last Good Day.\" At the time, it's just another decent day. The phone buzzes and Hazel answers it.Hi, Augustus.I may have...Um... sure. Is everything --I gotta go.I can't, I have to meet Gus.I'm not hungry.I am aggressively unhungry, ok?I have to go.No!I can't! I can't stay healthy because I'm not healthy, Mom. I am dying. I am going to die and leave you here alone and you won't have me to hover around and you won't be a mother anymore, and I'm sorry, but I can't do anything about it, ok?! Just leave me alone! Upon seeing her mother's face change, Hazel immediately regrets this.When.I worry that you won't have a life. That you'll sit around all day with no me to look after and stare at the walls and be miserable or off yourselves or something.You are? Hazel is stunned.So when you're waiting for me outside Support Group or whatever, you're always --Why didn't you tell me? Frannie and Michael don't quite know what to say.Are you kidding? Mom, this is awesome! This is fantastic! Oh my god! Hazel grabs her Mom for a hug.I'm so excited! You're gonna be so great, Mom!I know Mom. And I will. I promise. But right now... I really gotta go.I know, right?Late for what exactly?Why now?How did you even get in here?Um, no.\"Augustus Waters was the great star- crossed love of my life. Ours was an epic love story, and I won't be able to get more than a sentence into it without disappearing into a puddle of tears.\"I can't talk about our love story so instead I will talk about math. I am not a mathematician, but I know this: there are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1 And .12 And .112 And an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. I want more numbers than I'm likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and for that I am eternally grateful. I love you.\" Gus smiles, nods, and closes his eyes. CUT TO:Augustus Waters died eight days later in the ICU... Hazel's head falls into her chest.... when the cancer, which was made of him, stopped his heart, which was also made of him. Her bedroom door opens. It's Frannie and Michael. This only confirms her worst fears. She starts to cry. Her parents embrace her in the bed.It was unbearable. The whole thing. Every second worse than the last.One of the first things they ask you in the ER is to rate your pain on a scale from 1 to 10. I'd been asked this question hundreds of times and I remember once, early on, when I couldn't catch my breath and it felt like my chest was on fire, and the nurse asked me to rate the pain and though I couldn't speak, I held up 9 fingers. The loud music isn't protecting Hazel as well as she hoped. She falls apart nonetheless.Later on, when I'd been feeling better, the nurse came in and she called me a fighter. \"You know how I know,\" she said. \"Because you called a ten a nine.\"But that wasn't the truth. The reason I called it a nine was... I was saving my ten.And this was it. The great and terrible ten. When Mr. and Mrs. Waters see Hazel, they open their arms.He loved you so much too. More MOURNERS approach the family, leaving Hazel stranded in the receiving line. Her eyes turn towards the COFFIN. She's not entirely sure she wants to go there but she takes a deep breath, wills herself to walk towards it. Gus is there in the same suit he wore to Oranjee. Immediately, Hazel breaks down. And immediately, she catches herself.It's ok, you hear me? It's ok. She leans forward and kisses his cheek. She looks around. Once in the clear, she pulls out a hard pack of Camel Lights and sticks them in the space between Gus and the lining of the coffin. A MINISTER approaches at that moment.I was his girlfriend. Some laughter from the crowd. She takes out her notes.There's a beautiful quote in Gus's home that reads \"if you want the rainbow, you gotta deal with the rain.\" Hazel continues to speak but we over it, WE HEAR instead:I didn't believe a word, of course. But that was ok. Funerals, I'd decided, aren't for the dead. They're for the living. Gus's Parents, arm in arm, nod along with every word. CUT TO:I'll be fine.No, I'd... I'd like to be alone for a while. Hazel hugs Mom and Dad, walks alone towards the parking lot. As she gets to the car, Van Houten approaches.How did you even --And you just... bought a ticket?You read your fan mail now?I'm so not in the mood --Goodbye Mr. Van Houten.Nope. Thanks though. Have a great life.She had leukemia? Like Anna?Were you married then?Well I'm sorry for your loss.You didn't ruin our trip, you asshole. We had an awesome trip.You think I care about that? I don't give a shit, Van Houten. Hazel throws the piece of paper at Van Houten.You're a drunk and a jerk and a failure. And I'd like you to get out of my car right now so I can go home and grieve.Get out of the car! Van Houten knows he's too late. He does as he's told, stepping out of the car onto the side of the road. He stands there as Hazel peels out. In the rearview mirror, she sees him raise the FLASK, as if toasting her. She blinks away some tears and drives. CUT TO:He was really fighting for breath, I guess. He eventually went unconscious, but it seems like, yeah, it wasn't great or anything. Dying sucks.Happens all the time.Very.I know.I know.I didn't find it that annoying. They sit there in silence a few beats.He is not my friend and -- how do you know about that?Yeah well I'm over it. I never want to read another word of that asshole's again.I... I have to go. I... Are you...?Ok.", "clean_line": "choice world believe tell sad stories hand sugar coat way movies romance novels villains vanquished heroes born perfect hazel perfect gus kiss dark room beautiful

She barely leaves the house,... she reads the same book over and over...... some days she won't even get out of bed. The Doctor scratches his beard, thinking.She's gone a few times.Hazel.It's Friday night.I was just thinking... you should call your friends, see what they're up to.Of course not, no. I... I have errands to run. Hazel knows she's not planning to run any errands. She doesn't press the issue.Love you.Make some friends! Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO:Hi sweetheart. Ready for some \"Model?\"Are you ready, sweetie? 14-Year Old Hazel nods. Michael can't keep it together any longer. He completely breaks down.That's different. Hazel shrugs. Frannie looks intrigued.Did he give it to you?I'm sure he'll call, don't worry.Dr. Maria called today. The PET Scan is set for the eighth. Hazel nods. This could be a source of worry but she's not going to think about that right now. She's upbeat. And she's actually eating, which her parents can't help but notice. Frannie and Michael look at one another, pleased.I told you Support Group was a good idea. Hazel's phone buzzes. \"Augustus.\" She looks to her parents.What's wrong?!Hazel, I... I love you and... you know I'd do anything for you, but we don't...I mean, I could talk to your fatherSomething to drink?Are you out of your mind?It's too much, Haze. We can't accept something like that from a virtual stranger.Really?It's still \"no,\" I'm afraid.What?They thought it was a brain tumor.The usual. Fluid in the lungs, preventing oxygenation. They put that in... There's a TUBE in Hazel's side draining fluid into a plastic bladder that hangs off her bed.Drained a liter and a half last night.This is just a thing Hazel. It's a thing we can live with. Hazel nods again. Only in the universe of Hazel Grace Lancaster is something like this just a thing. Meanwhile:Are you ready, sweetie? 13-year old Hazel nods. The doctors get to work. The anaesthetic takes hold and Hazel goes under. But not enough. Cause she totally hears her mother say:I won't be a mom anymore.We'll be right outside. Hazel nods. Her phone buzzes. She looks at it. A text from Gus that reads: \"ok?\" Hazel looks at it. And she doesn't write back. CUT TO:What is it, what's wrong?!I'm not supposed to tell you until your father gets home.Dr. Maria called last night and made a convincing case that you need to live --I'm getting back in the tub now. When she leaves Hazel grabs her cell phone. ANGLE ON IT. Hazel sends Gus the following text: \"STILL FREE MAY 3? :-)\" A moment later Gus responds: \"EVERYTHING'S COMING UP WATERS!\" Hazel is over the moon with excitement. She smiles, then tries to calm herself, knowing it's the best thing.Amsterdam! And a moment later Michael joins them.We can't eavesdrop, Hazel. Back at the car, far out of earshot, they wait. Hazel unsure what that was about. Frannie politely honks the horn. A moment later Gus emerges from the house, smiling. A travel bag over his shoulder and a cigarette dangling from his lips.Amsterdam!(not looking up from herWe're from Indiana.Actually, it's five o'clock.Never made it.What? I like watching you sleep. Hazel shoots Frannie a look. Even in an exotic city, her Mom still can't enjoy herself.I promise I'll do crazy Mom stuff tonight while you and Gus are at dinner.You have reservations at a place called Oranjee. Mr. Van Houten set it up. Very fancy according to the Book. And romantic.I'm just saying...Let's get you dressed! Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO:Hazel! Gus is here.I really don't get that shirt. Hazel wears a screen print t-shirt of Magritte's \"Ceci N'est Pas Une Pipe.\"But it is a pipe.When did you get so grown up? I feel like it was yesterday I was telling 8-year old Hazel why the sky was blue. You thought I was a genius back then.And then what happened?And after that? A quick glance between Hazel and Gus.Sounds lovely. A few beats later.Listen... I'm gonna stretch my legs a little. Give the two of you some time to talk.Finish eating first.You haven't eaten a thing.You can't not eat, Hazel.Sit down.You have to eat, Hazel. You're not gonna starve yourself to death just because Gus is sick. You have to stay healthy --You heard me? Frannie has tears in her eyes. Hazel looks away, feeling terrible.You heard me say that to your father? Frannie sits down on the couch with her daughter.Oh god, sweetie. I'm sorry. I was wrong, ok? It wasn't true. It's not something I believe. Michael sits across from them.As long as either of us is alive, I will be your mother. Even if you die, I --Even when you die, I will still be your mother. I will always be your Mother. By now Michael is crying too. They all are.We're not gonna off ourselves. It's gonna hurt like hell to lose youI don't just sit around, you know. Hazel is confused. Frannie looks at Michael like, \"should I say something?\" She goes for it.I'm taking some classes. Online. To get my master's in social work.Working or reading. If I get my MSW, I can council families in crisis or lead groups dealing withThank you. That means everything to me. Mom and Daughter hug.

I'm Augustus Waters. 17. Had a touch of osteosarcoma bout a year and a half ago - lost this baby as a result...But really I'm just here at Isaac's request.Me? Oh I'm grand. I'm on a roller coaster that only goes up, my friend. Hazel smiles. Gus catches this. Embarrassed, she stops smiling and looks away.My fears? Gus thinks about this.Oblivion.Yeah, see... I intend to live an extraordinary life. To be remembered. If I'm scared of anything it's... not doing that. Patrick doesn't quite have the tools to deal with that.Literally. Hazel turns to find the Beautiful Boy, Augustus, standing right next to her.I thought we were in a church basement but apparently we were literally in the heart of Jesus. Hazel smiles.What's your name?No your full name?I didn't say anything.Because you're beautiful. Hazel is taken aback. No one's ever said that to her before.I enjoy looking at beautiful people and I decided a while back not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence. Particularly given that, as you so astutely pointed out, we're all gonna die pretty soon.Hey Alisa. Hazel isn't surprised that other girls know Gus. Of course they do. She turns back towards Isaac and Monica pawing at each other. She hears:\"Always\" is their thing. They'll \"always\" love each other and whatnot. Must have texted \"always\" to each other at least four million times this year. They continue to watch the show. It's pretty gross. Isaac squeezes Monica's breast like a clown horn.Let's watch a movie. Hazel is again surprised.No I mean now.Hmm?I've got a car. He shrugs. Hazel has never seen someone so confident.There is that possibility.Whole thing?Hamartia? Hazel folds her arms and turns away from him.They don't hurt you unless you light them.I've never lit one. Hazel turns back to him.It's a metaphor. See? You put the thing that kills you between your teeth. But you don't give it the power to do the killing. Hazel is floored. And impressed.I failed the test a couple times.Most amputees can drive with no problem but... yeah. Not me.Tell me about it! Another brake forces Hazel against the seat belt.The fourth time I took the test... it was going about how this is going... and when it was over, the instructor looks at me and goes, \"your driving, while unpleasant... is not technically unsafe.\"Total cancer perk. A few beats of silence.So what happened to you? Hazel takes a deep breath. She's told this story before but somehow this seems different.Wow.So are you back in school or...?Why not?A college girl! Well that explains the aura of sophistication... He smiles at her. She smiles back. Shoves his upper arm playfully. They're easing into each other. Eventually Gus's car pulls into his driveway.We're here. He's as good at parking as he is at driving. CUT TO:My parents call them \"encouragements.\" Don't ask. Gus's MOM and DAD are in the kitchen making dinner.Hey guys.This is Hazel Grace.I used to play.These are mine. And these. The rest of it's just cancer perks. Gus grabs a DVD from his stack of DVDs. Hazel sits down on the bed, her breathing noticeably heavier.I understand.You ok? Hazel nods, smiles.So what's your story?Not your cancer story. Your story. Interests, hobbies, passions, weird fetishes...Don't tell me you're one of those people who becomes their disease.I reject that out of hand. Think of something you love. First thing that comes to mind.Ok. What's that?Does it have zombies?Stormtroopers.Sounds horrible.Interesting. What's it about?... all I ask is that you read this brilliant and haunting novelization of my favorite video game. Hazel looks at the slim, ridiculous novella. She laughs. She's adorable when she laughs. She takes the book from him and as she does, their hands get tangled together for a brief, charged moment.Your hands are cold.Ooh Hazel Grace...Hazel Grace.Me? Yeah. I'm excellent. INTERCUT between Hazel on the patio and:Isaac! Focus. On. Me. Hazel waits a few beats for Gus to come back on. Finally:Isaac, Hazel from Support Group is coming downstairs. Gus waits for a response. None comes. He gestures for her to follow him into the room. Before he does:A gentle reminder: Isaac is in the midst of a psychotic episode.Seems Isaac and Monica are no longer a going concern.He just wants to cry and play video games.It doesn't hurt to talk to him, however. If you have any sage words of feminine advice...\"Pain demands to be felt.\"That could be an \"encouragement.\" It's silent for a beat. And then Isaac stands up, a funny look on his face.Isaac...? Suddenly Isaac starts kicking his chair across the room.Here we go... The chair lands against the bed. Gus hands Isaac something else to throw, a pillow. Isaac grabs the pillow and slams it against the wall. He dives on it and beings pummeling the pillow like a maniac.That's it! Punch that thing. And so he does. As he continues to, Gus looks at Hazel, cigarette dangling from his mouth.I've been wanting to call you on a nearly minutely basis but I have been waiting until I could form a coherent thought in re: \"An Imperial Affliction.\"The only problem is the ending.It's torture! I mean, I totally get that she died or whatever - Anna. But there is an unwritten contract between author and reader and I think ending your book in the middle of a sentence kind of violates that contract.Yeah like her Mom.Sysiphus the Hamster... Hazel beams. Gus totally gets the book. A bond between them.Have you tried contacting this... Peter Van Houten?Sad.Pillows don't break. Gus hands Isaac one of his basketball TROPHIES.You need to break something. Isaac looks at it, then back to Gus as if asking permission. Gus nods. Isaac holds it over his head and SMASH! The trophy breaks into a million pieces. Isaac almost smiles. Gus hands him another.Go to town, my friend. And Isaac does. Smashing them one by one. Hazel looks at Gus.I've been looking for a way to tell my Dad that I kinda hate basketball. Think maybe we've found it. Isaac grabs more of the TROPHIES, smashing them to pieces. Gus and Hazel enjoy the spectacle. When there are none left Isaac is panting, standing over the bronze carnage.Feel better? Isaac thinks about it. Shakes his head no. Gus puts his arm around him but looks at Hazel.That's the thing about pain... it demands to be felt. Hazel smiles. And on her face, we CUT TO:Hazel Grace.So I read it again. And I just kept feeling like... like it was a gift. Like you'd given me something important.On the other hand... we need closure, don't we?Yes. We need to know what happens to Anna's family after she dies.But he never wrote back.Because he's a recluse.Utterly unreachable.\"Dear Mr. Waters... I am writing to thank you for your electronic correspondence received this 6th of April. Hazel sits up. Could it be...?\"I am grateful to anyone who sets aside the time to read my book...\"I found his assistant. I emailed her. She must have forwarded it to him. Shall I continue?\"I am particularly indebted to you, sir, both for your kind words about `An Imperial Affliction' and for taking the time to tell me that the book, and here I quote you directly, `meant a great deal' to you.\" Hazel pays attention to every word.\"To answer your question: No, I have not written anything else, nor will I. I do not feel that continuing to share my thoughts with readers would benefit either them or me. However thank you again for your generous email. Yours most sincerely, Peter Van Houten.Hazel Grace, could I, with my meager intellectual capabilities, make up a letter from the great Peter Van Houten?Indeed.Not bad.Bit pretentious. But then again, Van Houten uses words like \"tendentious\" and... \"bacchanalia\" so I think he'll like it. Hazel smiles, looks at a clock.Guess so.Ok...Ok...Perhaps \"ok\" will be our \"always.\" Hazel smiles.Ok.Just use your wish.What'd you do? Hazel doesn't want to say. Gus realizes.Not Disney.Tell me you did not go to Disney World. Hazel Grace! You did not use your one dying Wish to go to Disney World!Oh my God!That is the saddest thing I've ever heard!Now I'm embarrassed.How can I have a crush on a girl with such cliche wishes?What? She looks at him. A beat. She quickly looks away, blushing. Gus continues on about Disney but all Hazel can think about is \"CRUSH\". She tries not to seem too excited. CUT TO:It is indeed.Hi Hazel.I'm great Mrs. Lancaster.Didn't cut this fella off for the hell of it. Though it is an excellent weight-loss strategy. Legs are heavy!N-E-C for fourteen months.I'm very lucky. ANGLE ON Hazel, checking herself out in the mirror. Seems to like what she sees a lot more than before. BACK ON Gus and Michael, downstairs:Every last one.See this? This circle is virgins... Now Gus draws a much smaller circle inside that circle.And this... is 17 year old dudes with one leg. Hazel laughs. Point made. He grabs her hand, helps her walk up a tiny hill. Once up there, Gus lays a blanket on the ground. They sit, looking out over a rather odd SCULPTURE - a set of GIANT WHITE BONES where children can jump and play.And he is. Much like Rik Smits. And tulips. Hazel raises an eyebrow at Gus. He's sure taking this Amsterdam/Dutch thing pretty far. He removes some sandwiches and orange juice out of a basket.Sandwich?How cool is that? A skeleton being used as a playground.Speaking of which... Gus stands up, takes a cigarette, puts it in his mouth. He clears his throat.You're probably wondering why you're sitting here eating a bad cheese sandwich and drinking orange juice with a guy in a Rik Smits jersey.Hazel Grace, like so many before you - and I say this with great affection - you spent your Wish... moronically.Hush! I'm in the midst of a grand soliloquy here.You were young. Impressionable. The Grim Reaper staring you in the face. And the fear of dying with your one true Wish left ungranted led you to rush into making one you didn't really want, for how could little Hazel Grace, having never read \"An Imperial Affliction\" ever know that her one TRUE wish was to visit Mr. Peter Van Houten in his Amsterdamian exile. Hazel nods in agreement.If you were smart, you would have saved your wish til the time in your life when you really knew your true self.Good thing I saved mine. Hazel cocks her head to one side. What is he talking about?Got it in exchange for the leg.I'm not gonna give you my Wish or anything. But I too have an interest in meeting Peter Van Houten and it wouldn't make much sense to meet him without the girl who introduced me to his book, now would it? I talked to the Genies and they're in total agreement.Because Hazel Grace... I found my Wish. And Hazel is beyond touched. We hear:Mr. Lancaster! How's she doing?They won't let me in. Family only.No I get it. Will you just... will you tell her I was here?Hazel Grace!Are you crying, Hazel Grace?What's the matter?I demand to see this swing set of tears. Hazel can't help but smile and we CUT TO: LATER. Same backyard - only now Hazel is with Gus. Which makes everything better. They both look at the swing set.I see your point.You do realize... trying to keep your distance from me will in no way lessen my affection for you. Hazel says nothing.All efforts to save me from you will fail. Hazel looks at him. He's sure not making this easy.Is this about Amsterdam? Cause weGrenades. Hazel nods.I get it. One day you're going to explode in a huge ball of fire and everyone close to you will die in your wake.There's already two people in your life you're going to destroy. Why add a third to that list. Am I right?We have got to do something about this frigging swing set.\"Desperately Lonely Swing Set Needs Loving Home.\"That's why. Hazel looks at him, not understanding.In case you were wondering... that's why I like you. You're so busy being you that you have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are. Hazel absorbs that. Her feelings for this boy in a tangle.Friendly. She playfully elbows him away.Ok.I don't smoke. The Flight Attendant shoots him a look.We're flying! Look! Hazel smiles at his enthusiasm.Holy -- look at that?! NOTHING HASShe is. I'm not. Hazel shoots him a look. Gus shrugs - \"what, it's the truth.\" Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO: LATER. Mid-flight, the plane is dark, Frannie's asleep. Hazel and Gus watch the same gory action movie. Actually, he watches the movie. She just watches him watch it. He watches it with gusto. Hazel continues to watch him. Try as she might, she's falling in love. CUT TO: SFX: the PLANE touching down. CUT TO:I'll be right down the hall. Hazel nods, already drifting off to sleep. CUT TO:Thank you ma'am. A few beats later Hazel emerges from the bathroom. She wears a knee-length, pale blue SUNDRESS. And she looks...Wow.You look gorgeous. Gus offers Hazel his arm. She takes it. They're ready to go.Ok. Hazel raises hers.The chef's choice sounds lovely. And can we get more of this?Thank you for coming to Amsterdam.Thank you for wearing that dress which is like whoa. Hazel shakes her head, trying not to smile but unable not to. The Waiter brings two more glasses of champagne and a plate:Yeah? Gus takes a bite.That is just...I want this dragon carrot risotto to become a person so I can take it to Vegas and marry it. Hazel leans back in her chair, in need of a breather.Thanks. First time wearing it.Oh no. That one's not nearly this nice. When I first found out I was sick - I mean, they told me I had like an 85% chance to be cancer-free. Great odds, sure. But that meant a year of torture, the loss of my leg, and still a 15% chance it might fail.That's what it is.Are we on a date?God?Angels?Afterlife?Absolutely.Oh for sure. I mean, not like a heaven where you ride unicorns, play harps, and live in a mansion made of clouds but, yeah, I believe in something. Hazel is surprised.Something becomes of us. It has to. Otherwise what's the point?I refuse to accept that.I'm in love with you.You heard me.I'm in love with you. And I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you. Sorry. At which point, the Waiter reappears.Just the check, please.Who's ready for some answers!As opposed to other days...? She playfully hits him. He takes her arm, picks up the oxygen tank, and up they go towards his front door. As they approach, there's a noticeable NOISE coming from inside the house. It's the deep thump of a BASS BEAT. Loud. Like, obnoxiously loud. Hazel grabs the brass ornament and knocks. They wait. There's no response.Maybe he can't hear over the music? Gus tries again, this time with more force. Still nothing. He tries a third time. Finally, the music stops. They wait. Still excited. A moment later the door swings open. It's a MAN IN PAJAMAS , with a huge potbelly, thinning hair, and a week-old beard. All he says is:Mr. Van Houten? At which point, the Pajama Man slams the door in their faces. Hazel and Gus are too stunned to react. Through the closed door, they hear this:It's 11am.Incidentally, thank you for dinner last night.Um...Are you messing with us?Is this some kind of performance?Hey. It's ok. It's ok... I'll write you a sequel. I will. Better than any shit that drunk could write. With blood and guts and sacrifice. You'll love it. Hazel nods, then wipes away tears. She fakes a smile and Gus gives her a hug. Afterwards:You did not spend it on him. You spent it on us. They embrace once more.I know... I know. Apparently the world is not a wish-granting factory. This gets a real smile from Hazel. That's when Lidewij comes outside. Clearly she's been crying too.I'm not going anywhere with that monster.You're a champion. Hazel smiles. When she's feeling up to it they walk into the next room, also empty. And another staircase, even more narrow and steep - practically a ladder. When Gus sees this he looks at Hazel:That's enough --We're at the top. That's it. Hazel becomes aware that TOURISTS look at her with concern. She smiles, stands up, nothing to see here. And now they're in the final room - a long, narrow hallway. This is where Anne Frank and 7 other people lived in hiding for as long as they could. There's a TIME LINE detailing their story.It's above my knee. She ignores him, more kissing. She takes off his shirt.It tapers a little and then it's just skin --My leg.I love you too, Hazel Grace. They resume kissing. And we CUT TO:\"I can't stand up, I'm too drunk.\"\"Standing is for fools!\"Shall we?There's something I have to tell you... They walk in silence a few beats.Just before you went into the hospital... There was this... I felt this... ache in my hip. Hazel grabs onto his arm, a lump already forming.I had a PET scan. Gus sits down on a BENCH. Looks up at her. Tries to smile. Before he even says it, she knows.It lit up like a Christmas tree, Hazel...The lining of my chest, my liver... everywhere.I'm sorry too --I should have told you --Apparently the world is... not a wish-granting factory. And at that point, Gus lets it go, lets himself cry and be sad and feel awful. But just for a second. Then he shakes it off, pulls Hazel's face up to his, tries again to smile through the tears.Don't you worry about me, Hazel Grace. I'll find a way to hang around and annoy you for a long time. She hugs him, perhaps a little too tightly. He winces.It's ok.Ok. But of course it's not ok. Not by a mile. Hazel takes a moment to look at him, touches his cheek.What?I don't suppose you can forget about it, treat me like I'm not dying.Would it be absolutely ludicrous to make out right now?I hate to one-up you but... seems my entire body is made out of cancer now, so... Isaac nods. Tries not to get emotional but it's happening. He goes to touch Gus's arm and accidentally touches his thigh.Whoa, I'm taken. Isaac laughs.Dude.I haven't asked her.I need speakers at my funeral. I thought maybe you and Isaac... but especially you --Would you be kind enough to whip something up?Hazel Grace! They turn to him.Do you happen to have four dollars?Oh it's there. REVEAL they're looking at Monica's green Firebird.Who cares where she is? This is not about her. This is about you. Hazel... Hazel nods, opens the egg carton, hands Gus an egg. Gus puts it in Isaac's hands. Positions Isaac - who, of course, can't see a thing - towards the Firebird. Isaac winds up and tosses the EGG. It misses the car by a mile. After a beat:A little to the left.Aim left. Isaac turns his shoulders.Lefter. Isaac turns some more.Yes! Excellent! And throw hard. Gus hands him a SECOND EGG. Isaac winds up and hurls it - missing the car again but hitting the HOUSE.Bullseye!No you missed it by like 20 feet. Try one more time. Isaac hurls it, this time smashing the car's taillight. Isaac's face lights up.Keep throwing, keep throwing! Isaac does. Gus smiles, putting an unlit cigarette in his mouth. Hazel watches him, enjoying this moment. Eventually, MONICA'S MOM opens the front door and comes out.Are you Monica's mom?Hello ma'am. Your daughter has done an injustice and we've come here seeking revenge. We may not look like much. Between the three of us, we have five legs, four eyes, and two and a half working lungs.But we also have two dozen eggs. So If I was you, I would go back inside. Monica's Mom is very confused. A beat. Without another word, she turns and goes back inside. The three of them celebrate. As Isaac picks up where he left off, Hazel gently kisses Gus on the cheek. And over we hear:Oblivion.I know it's kid's stuff but... I always thought I'd have a grand story to tell, you know? Something that would run in all the papers. I always thought I was special.Yeah but... you know what I mean. Hazel, annoyed finishes her cup, tosses it to the side. Gus can tell he's said something wrong.What?Don't get mad --You're right --You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Gus hands Hazel another Winnie the Pooh cup. Raises his to hers in a toast.It's a good life, Hazel Grace. She softens. They toast.I'm at the gas station --Something's wrong. You gotta... please come help me.No! Please! Hazel, listen to me. Do not call 911 or my parents -- I'll never forgive you -- Don't, please. Gus starts to cry.Please just look at it. Hazel lifts up his shirt. His ABDOMEN is bright red.I wanted to buy some cigarettes. I lost my pack. Or they took it.I don't know. They said they'd get me another one but I wanted... to do it myself. Do one little thing myself. Hazel doesn't know what to do.No, Hazel, please! But she must. She gets out her cell phone and dials. At which point, Gus really loses it, weeping like the poisoned, dying teenage boy that he is. As Hazel dials, we hear:I hate myself I hate myself I hate this I hate this...Read me something.Do you know any poems?Read it to me.Good evening, Hazel Grace. His voice is strong today, and Hazel is happy to hear it.Quick question for you. Did you ever write that eulogy I asked you to prepare?Excellent. Do you think you could find yourself at the Literal Heart of Jesus in 20 minutes.I love you Hazel. The call ends. Hazel, confused, stands to go.Hazel Grace, you look ravishing.I wanted to attend my funeral. By the way, will you speak at my funeral? Hazel looks at him like \"of course, silly\" and then kisses him on the mouth.Sweet. I'm hopeful I'll get to attend as a ghost, but just to make sure, I thought I'd - well, not to put you on the spot, but I thought I'd arrange a pre-funeral.No time like the present.Would you believe they leave the door open at night?As well you shouldn't. He smiles and for a brief moment it's old Gus. Hazel laughs. Isaac clears his throat.Thank you Isaac. This causes Isaac to lose it. He clings to the lectern.Hey don't swear in the Literal Heart of Jesus.Hazel Grace, it's down to you.", "clean_line": "hi augustus waters touch osteosarcoma bout year half ago lost baby result isaac
