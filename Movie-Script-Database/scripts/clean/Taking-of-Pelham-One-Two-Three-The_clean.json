Blue presses on the barrel of his gun, depressing Doyle's cheek.Pay attention to me. Open your cab door or I '.11 kill you.All right, Mr. Green?Then get it started. Green moves over to face the controls. He stares down at them for a moment, then reaches with his left hand to the controller, his right to the brake handle. Pressing down firmly on the controller, he nudges it to the left.Keep going --What happened?You said you could drive this thing.That's right, Mr. Green -- tell him all about yourself.You'll be hearing from Command Center in a minute )r two but you'll ignore the call -- you won't answer -- is that perfectly clear?Keep still!Any trouble, Mr.'Green?I unpacked your weapon. Get this thing moving -- we're run- ning almost two minutes behind. Picking up his submachine gun, and holding it vertically along his pants leg, Blue eases himself through the door and shuts it after him.And. you will remain silent! There will be no further warning -- any- one who moves or speaks without permission is going to be killed. There is immediate silence as he-looks around.This weapon fires 450 rounds of .45 calibre ammunition per minute. In other words, if all of you de- cided to rush me simultaneously, not a single one ,of you would get any closer than you are right now. Is that understood? This news is met in stony, awe-struck, terrified silence. Except for the Pimp who smiles, seemingly relaxed.Everybody in this half of the car -- that's from here on back -- move up front, please. Everybody. Right now -- upiGet going, Mr. Green. Green nods and goes to the front, uses a key to slide open the storm door, steps out and closes it again, then jumps down onto the tracks.Motorman -- come here.I want you to walk uptrack and collect all the passengers in the nine cars we out loose, and lead them back to the 28th St. Station -- is that clear?Just do as you're told: The Hooker raises her hand.No. No one else can leave.Nobody leaves!Yes. What's happening is that you're all being held by four dangerous men with machine guns.Please be quiet -- nothing's going to happen if you do as you're told. Get going, Motorman. As Doyle leaves at one end of the train, Green reappears at the other.All right, Mr. Green?I still see some tunnel lights.. Stay here -- and leave the cab door open so you can hear the radio. Blue returns to the center of the car but CAMERA stays on Green as he opens the cab door.What time've you got, Mr. Green?Correct. Time to start. Any- thing you want to say first?What do you want, Mr. Green?All right.Part of it.Recovering. They sounded a little upsat.Go back outside -- I don't want Mr. Brown and Mr. Grey left alone with the passengers any longer than we have to.I trust Mr. Brown -- Mr. Grey's another matter. He's a cocky little pain in the ass who could turn out to be real trouble if we don't watch him.He was recommended.Go on -- This is Pelham One Two Three, Trainmaster -- are you ready to take down the list of our demands?Do you have a pencil?To begin with it is important that you understand three things: One --Was he alone?Take over back there. I want Mr. Grey up closer to me so I dan keep an eye on him.Maybe it was necessary -- I didn't see it.What were you' calling about?It's 2:24, Lieutenant -- you still have 49 minutes.49 minutes.49 minutes.48 minutes.Everything quiet out here, Mr. Green?what do you mean?Which one?I'd better frisk him. Cover me. He walks slowly down the aisle and stops. in front of theOn your feet.You heard me -- stand up! Nervously, the man stands. Blue frisks him, quickly and expertly. When he fails to find a weapon, he takes the man's wallet.Okay -- you can sit down.School teacher.You ever been told you look like a policeman,?Listen to me, everybody. I'm sure you've' all figured out what' happening by now -- you're hostages.That means when we get what we,want you'll be released unharmed. Until then, you will continue doing precisely as you're told. _Don't worry -- they're going to pay. They have no choice.It wouldn't matter if all seventeen were dope pushers -- they have to pay, so relax.Then a lot of people are going to die.Either you live or you die.It depends. It's Y not better than trying to sell mutual funds, for example.I tried.I was. That's where I developed my expensive tastes.The Biafrans paid me twenty-five hundred for leading a battalion.The market dried up.What'd they nail you for?Beakies?You were innocent?Yes.I read you. Please take down the next set of instructions. As before, they're to be obeyed to the letter. First -- the money is to be paid in the following denominations: five hundred thousand dollars in fifties, five hundred thousand dollars in hundreds.Making a total of ten thousand fifty dollar bills and Alive thousand hundred dollar bills -- which will then be put up in stacks of two hundred bills each, bound with a thick rubber band lengthwise and another widthwise.Point two: all of the bills will be old bills, their serial numbers to erandom.That's all for now. When the delivery arrives we will contact you with further instructions.I'm signing off now.It's two-forty-seven, Prescott you have twenty-six minutes.Twenty-six minutes, Prescott.The city has agreed to pay for your release. No one quite knows how to greet this news -- except the Pimp who slowly, mockingly, claps his hands together.No -- but soon afterwards.What difference does it make?A million dollars.Altogether.Pull in your feet -- someone's liable to get hurt. The. Hippie looks up at him, smiles, and slides his feet back. Blue continues until he comes to Grey. He speaks quietly to him.Stop fooling around with that girl, Mr. Grey.I said leave her alone.Maybe we'll get a chance to work that out.They've requested more time.Ten minutes.I 'didn't -give it to them.Then we do what we said we'd do. There's no other way.An hour's plenty! You know how the system works -- you give them two hours and they take two -- three and they take three. An hour's plenty!I don't know. They're running pretty late.Mr. Green --Coming up on one minute.Mr. Brown.He won't mind.Mr.. Brown's better. With hint it's just a job -- not kicks. He looks at his watch as the.SUPERIMPOSED time continues to run: \"3:12.07-08-09--toFifty seconds -- then we erase one.Return to your position, Mr. Grey.You heard me, Mr. Grey! I don't think there'll be any more.How does it feel?How many shots were there?We can't afford to. I'll go pick one cut.That's right, conductor. Would you come along with me, please?There's something you can help us with. Bud still hesitates.Don't worry, conductor -- comeAll you have to do is walk uptrack about a hundred feet and wait for the men delivering the money. They have reached the rear where Bud manages to avoid looking at Brown while Blue slides open the door.I'll help you down onto the track.One of my people was shot -- I warned you what the penalty would be.In the meantime, where's the money?Mr. Grey -- He gestures for Grey to join them which he does, his eyes on the money all the time.Get your things off -- both of you -- and start loading up. Blue watches while both Grey and :Brown remove their raincoats, jackets and finally their shirts. Brown has a blood-stained kerchief tied around his right upper arm. Both wear what can only be called money vests: canvas, sleeveless, fitting over the head like a Mae West, with ties on the sides, and containing pockets, 20 in all, front and back.Jr. Grey, you do Mr. Brown, then he'll do you -- nineteen packets each. Blue continues to observe for a mc-,ment as Grey starts inserting packets of pills, one to a pocket, into Brown's vest, as Brown stands stiffly, his hands at his sides. Then Blue walks to the front end of the car, joining Green.When they're finished it'll be your turn. Mr. Grey will load you up. But don't go down there until Nr. Brown has come here to take your place. I'll load up as soon as I talk-to Prescott.Pretty soon now. He goes into the motorman's cab and shuts the door.I'm going to give you five specific instructions. Each one i.s.to be followed precisely -- is that clear?One: at the end of this conversation you will restore power to the entire sector.Twos you will clear the local track all the way from 28th Street to South Ferry. By clear I mean switches properly set and all signals green. I emphasize green, Prescott -- if eve so much as see a red light, let alone get tripped by one, we will shoot a hostage.Three.: all southbound trains behind us, local and express, are to remain lying dead. Likewise all northbound between South Ferry and here.Four: you will con-\",act me as soon as the track is clear and all signals are green.Five: you will remove all police personnel from the tunnel. If we see a single cop between here and South Ferry we will shoot a hostage. In fact, any deviation from these instructions and we will shoot a hostage.Your attention, please -- in a moment we're going to start moving again. You will all remain seated and quiet. We expect to release you unharmed in a short while, but until then you must continue doing exactly as you're told. Come along, Mr. Green. He heads for the motorman's cab, Green right behind him. The Pimp looks at Grey for a moment.Go ahead then.Go ahead, Mr. Green. Green edges the controller forward and the car responds.Keep it steady.No -- steady as she goes.Slight change of plan. We decided to put some distance between us and all those cops you had hidden in the tunnel back there.We'll be stopping soon. Just get back when you've cleared the rest of the track. Signing off. 'Perfectly natural under the circumstances. They're thinking just the way we want them to.Look sharp now -- it's comingDo you see it?All right -- this is close enough. Green starts to apply the brake.Ignore him -- he'll get tired and quit after a while. Let's get this stuff unpacked -- there isn't much time. They are unbuckling the straps and unfolding the canvas bag, then attacking the zipp`rs.Go ahead. Green attacks the windshield with tine stock of the gun, opening a great splintered hole.Get it all -- it's got to look right. Green uses the gun's barrel to scrape around the edges, clearing away the last traces of glass. Blue now hands Green another length of pipe -- this one about three feet long. Green fits one end over the protruding end of the attached short pipe -- not screwing it, merely fitting it. The other end extends straight out the glassless windshield.Try.it once -- make sure it comes away clean. Green yanks at the long pipe and it separates from the shorter one.Okay. Now j um_ down --- Ill hand the other oiece through. Green leaves the cab.Make sure its tight.Come on back in. Green returns to the storm door c There Brown extends his left hand and pulls Green back up into the car.Don't worry -- ten minutes from now we'll be free and clear.Thanks, Command Center. Give Prescott our regards.Over and out. He gives the mike a strong tug and-snaps the wire.I want this train moving in thirty seconds. Tell Mr. Brown and Mr. Grey they.rcan cut the emergency brake cords. Green leaves the cab. Blue examines the gimmick one last time, then follows Green out.You will remain in your seats. Don't try to get up.I mean remain seated. He has reached the rear, walking backwards, and now gropes behind him for the door handle.All right, Mr. Green -- Green, a hand on the protruding pipe connected to the controller handle inside the Motorman's cab, now grabs it with both hands and pushes inward, toward the train.Let's move along, gentlemen -- there's no time to waste. You all remember the drill. What's wrong, Mr. Brown?What did it look like?All right, we do it exactly as we did in the drill -- by the numbers.Shut up and do what you're told.Hats, glasses, wigs and mustaches -- They remove their disguises anal we see their faces for the first time.Remove gloves --Check handguns in coat pocket --Remove magazines from submachine guns. All of them pick up their submachine guns but only three remove the magazines and then place the guns back dcwn again. Grey merely watches the other three,. continuing to hold his gun under his arm, a slight smile on his face.Did you hear me, Mr. Grey? Disarm your gun and put it down so we can I get out of here.Put it down, Mr. Grey --Nothing's gone wrong. The plan depends on our walking away un- noticed. You can't do that carry- ing a submachine gun.You're leaving your gun here, Mr.Mr. Green will put it on over his own.You're the thinnest one -- it'll show less. Hurry up and undress. Mr. Brown -- help me with Mr. Grey. They start to work on the dead body as Green starts undressing.I'd never make it -- IQuiet! He listens again, then leaves his pillar, and hurries downtrack to the next where he again waits and listens,Mr. Green -- ! It's all right! Go on up -- I'll be right with you -- !You were on the train. Are you a cop? Almost imperceptibly, the Hippie nods -- just once.Then the Mayor will come to your funeral. X He lifts his gun to aim and fire and the Hippie manages to turn his head away.

She smiles at the Japanese and walks back to the elevators, pressing the UP button. Prescott looks at the four men for a moment, uncertainly, then goes after the Secretary and speaks to her in low tones.You're not.You have. The elevator door opens and-she steps in, smiling sweetly.The New York City Subway System is the largest'in the world, with 237 miles of track and seven thousand cars that carry over a billion and a third passengers every year, making it also the busiest railroad in,the world. I can see that this last fact surprises you. The Japanese look anything but surprised. Prescott goes on, resolutely.Yes. Well- Grand Central is the busiest station passenger-wise -- train-wise, it's West 4th St. on the I.N.D. line. Now, if you'll step this way, gentlemen - They step no way at all. Prescott gestures broadly.I'm sure you have your own share of crime on the Tokyo subway, right? They merely stare at Prescott and smile.Right. He.clears his throat, loosens his tie and looks around for help.Uh -- follow me, gentlemen,These are the assignment desks, one for each of the three lines -- the I.R.T., the B.M.T. and the I.N.D. -- and.over here, the Oper- ations Lieutenant, Sol Garber. Prescott has stopped beside a desk. GARBER, 40, stocky, dour, with a dark stubble that requires shaving twice a day, is absorbed reading the Village Voice.Uh -- Sol -- I'd like you to meet some friends of the Chairman. Garber looks up over his paper for a moment.Good friends of the Chairman.They're -- uh -- directors of the Tokyo Subway.I do say. I -- uh -- told them things are usually jumping. like crazy in here.How about another one, Sol?In the course of a normal week the T.A. Police have to deal with such crimes as robbery, assault, murder, drunkenness, injury, illness, vandalism, abusiveness, sexual molestation and exhibitionism.We carry firearms, of course -- off duty as well as onDon't worry -- they don't under- stand a word. Come on, you dummies -- get the lead out lThere he is, gentlemen -- Train- master Frank Correll, the Lord Byron of the New York Subway System. Observe the way smoke and fire shoot out of his ears.What's the matter, Frank?No idea what's wrong?Hit your six button, will you, Frank? I want T.A. Police in on this.Holy Christ, I forgot!- Since this is my last day on the job, I might as well make it a good one. He leans over Correll and, pushing a button, speaks into the mike.Prescott to Garber --Sol -- plug everything you've got into the I.R.T. Trainmaster's circuit, will you? -- an all-unit stand-by, on the d-)uble. And call in the city cops -- put it on a 9-11 so their computer gets it.A train's been hijacked.There's no way you can get away with it -- you're underground, in a tunnel. Why do you concern yourself with that, Lieutenant? At precisely 3:13 we will begin executing the passengers. Don't you think you'd better contact the Mayor without wasting any more time? The moment you've done it report back to me for further instructions. Sign- ing off.Sol -- did you get all that?What about the city cops?Two cars -- you sure they can spare that many? What about our own men? We got anyone at 28th St.?Oh, God --Jesus -- I knew him --They just shot him.Who's this?Yes, Captain.You're kidding! A cop? How do you know?Plainclothes?Man or woman?Captain -- I wouldn't mind getting over there myself.What for?What do you know.Tell 'em to shut up and get off the air -- I need some more lines open !Oh, get off it, Frank -- our priority is trying to save the lives of those passengers!Oh, you're beautiful. Do you read me, Pelham One Two Three -- ?Yeah, well, you're not handling it so why don't you start doing your own work and let the police do theirs.We don't.even know it is a he -- Do you read me, Pelham One Two Three -- ?Nothing yet.We need more time.Be reasonable, will you? We're trying to cooperate but you're not giving us enough time to work with.We're dealing with City Hall, for God's sake -- you know what a mass of red tape that is!Look, I know how to tell time, too, but we aren't gonna get anywhere if all you do is repeat 49 minutes!Go away, Frank -- go play with your trains.This is Command Center --Will do.

Don't be stupid -- we've agreed to pay the money. Now turn off the clock.Look -- your instructions are complicated! The money has to be counted, stacked, tied, transported all the way uptown -- it just isn't physically possible! You'd be surprised what's physically possible. The clock's running, Prescott.But he may still be alive He's dead.But you can't be sure -- Very well -- we'll put another halfYeah, who's this?I'll be goddamned if I know. Jesus! How long does it take to get that money together? rThere's still fifteen minutes. I'm signing off,. Sol.

Command Center calling Pelham One Two Three -- come in, Pelham -- This is Pelham One To Three --This is Prescott. Listen -- we're moving too slowly at this end. We need some more time. Sorry -- no more time. Prescott's face hardens, his jaw. muscles tense.I said knock it off! I'm trying to buy some more time! A silence in the room as everyone turns to watch Prescott as he speaks into the mike.All we want is another fifteen minutes, all right? A lousy fifteen minutes ! Negative.Ten minutes, then -- what difference can ten minutes make?Where are they now, Daniels -- ?What've we got -- ?No way. Pelham One Two Three -- this isThe money's en route -- making pretty good time, too -- but it won't get to you by 3:13. I'm sorry to hear that.Listen -- suppose we get it to the station entrance by then -- will you change the deadline from delivery to you to arrival at 28th Street? Will you do that at least -- ?Clear, clear. Daniels -- they bought it. If we get it to the station entrance by 3:13 we'll be okay.Except for one thing --We still won't make it.Daniels -- for God's sake answer me! Where's that goddam money -- ?!what the hell are you talking about?! It can't be wrecked -- we're out of time, goddammit!What do you mean, that's all?! They're just about to shoot some poor sonuvabitch -- 1!They don't know anything, for Chrissake! How can they know anything down where they -- Holy shit, that's it!! He punches a button on the console as the SUPERIMPOSED numbers now reflect the time down to the tenth of a second:Yeah. I'm still here. Tell me something -- if we were a couple of seconds late -- you'd have knocked off an innocent person? Affirmative. Now if you're ready, I'll give you instructions for the delivery of the money. Again, I'll have to insist you follow them to the letter.Go ahead. Two unarmed policemen will walk down the track -- one with the money, the other with a light which he'll flash continuously from side to side in a sweeping motion. When they reach the car the rear door will open and the one with the money will throw it in onto the floor. Then they will both turn and walk back to the 28th Street Station. Acknowledge.I've got it. Is that all? For now. But keep it in mind that the same ground rules apply -- any wrong move by anyone and we'll kill a hostage.I could've. guessed that part. You have ten minutes to deliver the money. If it isn't here by then --Yeah, I know -- -it's getting mono- tonous. I don't suppose you'll give us longer than ten minutes -- Ten's more than enough, PrescottYou don't really think you're gonna get out of there, do you?What the hell are you talking about, Sol? How do you know they shot a hostage?But why?! We're still under the delivery deadline --Who the hell fired at them?I better find out. Christ, what a fucking mess! Pelham One Two Three -- come in, Pelham, this is Prescott -- This is Pelham -- go ahead, Prescott --Did you have to do it, you bastard?This is Prescott --So far.Sol -- you there -- ?Hold on while I cut in the cityDaniels, I've got Lieutenant Garber of the Transit Police on the line with us. I have the latest instructions from the hijackera\u00e2\u0080\u00a2. They want power restored, the tracks cleared, all signals green as far as South Ferry, and no cops anywhere. Okay, so we go along -- we have to -- but then what? What do you think they've got in mind?But they did pick it'-- and since everything they've done so far hasbeen organized down to tha smallest detail, it stands to reason they've got the rest worked out, too.All they'll do is bottle themselves up. That's no good.Do you think it's the water, Sol? Maybe they've got a boat waiting in the harbor -- dr a seaplane --Grand Central Tower has 'em on their model board -- we can see every move they make. If they stop anywhere before South Ferry we'll know about it.I'm listening --Will you shut up and listen?

Since when?Hold on -- Sol -- she's moving!Who the hell do you think?! Pelham! What's she doing now, Grand Central?Which is probably why they did it. You heard from Daniels yet?Daniels -- ?

Daniels --- turn around, we're going back.They're not on the train -- I'm sure of it!They figured out how to beat it -- that's their aanl,, -- that's what they started with!
