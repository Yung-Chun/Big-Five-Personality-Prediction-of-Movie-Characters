{"Chasing-Amy": {"BANKY": {"raw_line": "Felt Like this fucking day would never come. Issue two - on the shelf.Don't start, alright! This is a cool moment, and I'd appreciate you not trying to ruin it. How often does a guy get the opportunity to purchase something with his name on it! Banky Edwards- right! Holden McNeil.C'mon, sour puss. We got the rest of our lives to be artists. But it's supply and demand. And right now, the unwashed masses demand this.I'll tell you who we're better than: these two fags right here. They approach the counter, where STEVE-DAVE, the store manager, and WALT the Fan-boy, play a card game.Alright Old-Maid's - take a break from the Crazy-8's marathon and ring us up.You guys operate the smallest, ladies' bridge circle I've ever seen.I don't think they're fans.I ink it and I'm also the colorist. The guy next to me draws it. But we both came up with the characters,Well. It means that Holden draws the pictures in pencil, and then he gives it to me to go over in inkIt's not tracing. I add depth and shading to give the image mere definition. Only then does the drawing really take shape.Not really. Next! A LITTLE KID steps up but the Collector lingers.It's not tracing.Do you want Lour book signed or what?I'm secure with what I do.How should I sign this?I'LL TRACE A CHALK LINE AROUND YOUR DEAD FUCKING BODY, YOU FUCK?!YOUR MOTHER'S A TRACER!!He started it! Fucking cock-knocker! He's lucky I didn't put my pen through his thorax!What's a Nubian?Intergalactic Civil War!Well isn't that true! Hooper explodes, He pulls a nine millimeter from his belt, draws on Banky and fires. Banky goes down, falling forward into the crowd The crowd screams and starts to scatter, Hooper jumps over the table and raises his fists in the air.Well what about you! You didn't tell me you were going to scream \u0011Black Rage'. I nearly pissed myself.Wrong coast.Faggot.Hey, hey! I'll play your victim, but not your catcher.I've read your book. It's cute. Chick stuff, but cute. Holden hits him.What?We're gonna take off soon...We'll go. INT BAR - NIGHT Holden, Banky, Alyssa and Hooper sir around a table drinking, talking, and smoking.Archie, alright! Archie and the Riverdale gang were a pure and fun- lovin' bunch. You can't find dysfunction in those comics, because they were just flat out wholesome.Shut the fuck up.Man, I feel a hate-crime coming onBecause he wanted them both at the same time, you assholes! He never chose one because he was trying to get both of them into a three-way!Eat it. Urkel.That's it. You.You are marching back across the street with me, and we're going to pick up a shit load of Archie books, I am going to prove to you - beyond the shadow of a doubt that Archie was all about pussy. Come on.You're insane. Archie is not fucking Mister Weatherbee!He's just offering to help Archie with his homework!Fuck this. Let's go. Traffic. Holden!Let's go.What the...! Son of a bitch!This is one of the best street lights you've ever drawn.Looks just like it.Get a pizza. Watch 'Degrassi Junior High'.I've got a weird thing for girls who say 'aboot'.Who was that?When's that faggot going to learn - you like chicks.So when we leaving?And?Like I care about your shit. Maybe I'll hook up myself.How does one man get to be so funny!Like that'll happen.Oh, you had a moment!Alright - bring on the free hootch.Hey, I befriended a guy in a position of authority so I could abuse that authority and get free shit. You want to do the same? There's a lonely Hindu works at the'7-ll' across the street. Get in tight with him.Wanna be friends!Taking a piss. Guy's got a bladder like an infant.Must his mother tell him everything!What'd you do - fall in love?She ain't no Denny Terrio, I'll say that.There're a lot of chicks in this place.He didn't really say that about my dick, did he!This is so queer.Now that, my friend, is a.. ...shared momentWhat?!Man, when are we ever going to get a chance to see this kind of shit live without paying for it?Oh, and you're an old hand at this.You said 'fuck'. To that girl. You said you'd 'fuck' her.How can a girl 'fuck' another girl! Were you talking about strap-ons or something?What!!? It's a valid question. You know the dyke stuff in the Penthouse Letters section is written by guys - this is our chance to get the inside scoop.Then what's with saying 'fuck? Shouldn't you say 'eat her out' or at least modify the term 'fuck' with something like 'fist'?Ask Hooper.Sure.Hey - I always notice the bored look in their eyes.Some of them I downright loathe.I don't do that.I stopped dropping. It got to be too frustrating.What?! I lost my tolerance for the bullshit baggage that comes with eating girls out. What's the big deal?!Not the smell - the smell is good. I'm talking about not being able to do it property. And my mother brought me up to believe that if I can't do something right I shouldn't do it at all. Of course, my father told me she gave lousy head, but that's beside the point.No, I blame them. Chicks never help you out. They never tell you what to do. And most of them are self- conscious about that smell factor, and so most of the time they just lay there, frozen like a deer in the headlights, right? Not for nothing, but when a chick goes down on me. I let her know where to go, and what the status is. You gotta handle it like CNN and the Weather Channel - constant updates.And that's all I'm saying, it'd be different if chicks helped out - pointed a guy in the right direction. Then there'd be no bullshit, no wasted time, and no chance for permanent injuries.Sure. You wanna see something permanent! I got this from Nina Rollins, sophomore year. I'm going down on her, and out of nowhere, her cat jumps on her stomach. She does this big ol' pelvic thrust - cracks my tooth in half, sends it down my throat. I had to get a crown for the stub.You see this! That's the farthest I can move my neck to the right Sophomore year, I'm going out with Maria Bennert, and for six months, I'm going down on her, and not a damn thing's happening. Then one night, I change a position, or vary my lapping-speed, and suddenly it's a whole new world. She's moving around, convulsing, breathing heavy. And her legs are pressing against my ears so tightly that I don't hear her father come into the room. He grabs my hair... ...and he pulls me way back, hard.What traffic - it's one thirty in the morning!Since you like chicks, right.. do you just look at yourself in the mirror all the time?You're still dwelling on the dyke, aren't you?What'd I tell you - she just needs the right guy. All every woman really wants - be it mother, senator, nun - is some serious deep-dicking.Don't give me that look - I heard Adam Curry say worse.That's why I can't buy lesbians. Everyone needs dick. See, I can buy fags. Bunch of guys that need dick - just plain need it? That I get. Dykes? Bullshit posturing. But - live and let live, I guess.Sloss like a mother fucker.Even more retarded and juvenile to sate the voracious, intellectually- challenged miscreants that make up your key demographic.You did better - you sold us out!Money and Power, and Money and Power...What's not a good idea! Please don't say the cartoon, please don't say the cartoon...John, let me handle this. You are out of your fucking mind, aren't you!No, I'd like to be remembered as the filthy rich guy who created Bluntman and Chronic.He just has to get over this crush of his.Not on her; on Alyssa Jones - the chick that does that comic book 'Idiosyncratic Routine'. You ever seen it?She'd never let him in her yard. The chick's gay.Always working, you. Look at this - Mrs. M-TV Exec has a string of pearls hanging our of her ass,I'm taking this as a precaution - just in case they give us any shit about pussy's decision delay. You'll 'give it some thought'. You're so retardedThe guy who sold it to me had an honest face.I got the Sega in one bag, my clothes in the other, and two months worth of unread comics in this one.Hold on.I just have to get something.Read the articles. What do you think I'm going to do with them? They're stroke books.Variety's the spice of life. I like a wide selection. Sometimes I'm in the mood for nasty close-ups, sometimes I like them arty and air-brushed. Some times it's a spread brown-eye kind of night, sometimes it's girl-on-girl time. Sometimes a steamy letter will do it, sometimes - not often, but sometimes - I like the idea of a chick with a horse.His master's voice.Do you Like horsies?...And then Black Beauty couldn't take it any longer, and he finally did some of his own mounting.I think I want kids of my own one day. They're fun.What? Why?Hunhh! Yeah. But this is carry-on.Not this trip. But one time, when I was using curb side check-in, this sky- cap gave me a cock ring and a set of anal ben-wa balls. I always thought that was pretty strange. He said his name was Frank. Hey! You're name's Frank!I thought you lived in the city? This is like the umpteenth time I've seen you here. Isn't that grounds enough for the little pink mafia to throw you out of their club?Bitch, you're schooling no one.You fucking cock-teaser. I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.Fuck! You Fucking cock-sucker, man! These faggots won't do what I tell them to!No, it's these... fucking queers on blades that can't accept a fucking pass to save their lives! What period is this?Fuck! Look at your fucking guys, they... FUCK!!! FUCKING COCK SUCKER, MAN! I SWEAR TO GOD!How was your pseudo-date?That chick bugs me.Get off. Fucking faggot! Did you see that?! Your dyke courting ass just got me scored on!What the fuck is going on here?Not with this shit! With you. What the fuck is going on with you and that girl?She's programming you.Yeah. And apparently, you don't even realize it. What does it matter if I refer to her as a dyke, or if I call the Whalers a bunch of faggots in the privacy of my own office, far from the sensitive ears of the rest of the world?Bear with me here. I just want to put you through this little exercise. Okay, now see this? This is a four way road, okay?Which one's going to get to the hundred dollar bill first?I'm serious. This is a serious exercise. It's like an S.A.T. question. Which one's going to get to the hundred dollar bill first - the male-friendly lesbian, the man-hating dyke, Santa Claus, or the Easter Bunny?Good. Why?BECAUSE THESE OTHER THREE ARE FIGMENTS OF YOUR FUCKING IMAGINATION!She's fucking with your mind, man! She knows you've got this schoolboy crush and she's using it to sway your way of thinking!Maybe she thinks you'll get her comic picked up by Contender. Or maybe she thinks you'll change the content of our book to something more political and message oriented. Or, gee - I don't know - maybe because that's just what dykes like to do: fuck around with straight guys' heads, just so she can go back to her little rug-muncher club and have a good laugh with all her man-hating harpy cronies about how fucking stupid and easily duped men are!You don't even know this girl! Big deal, she's from Middletown and she went to North! All the girls at North were bitches and sluts anyway! And this one's got them beat by a mile because she's a bitch/slut/dyke!Oh why? Do you get my back when she bashes me? Because I know she does. And do you know why she does? Because I won't play her fucking game!What is it about this girl? You know you have no shot at getting her into bed! Why do you bother wasting time with her? Because you're Holden fucking McNeil - most persistent traveller on the road that's not the path of least resistance! Everything's gotta be a fucking challenge for you, and this little relationship with that bitch is a prime example of your fucking condition. Well I don't need a fucking magic eight ball to look into your future; you want a forecast? Here - will Holden ever fuck Alyssa. What a shock - \"Not fucking likely\"! This relationship of your's is affecting you, our work and our friendship, and the time's going to come when I throw down the gauntlet and say it's me or her! And then what're you going to say?!No, what would you say? Would you trash twenty years of friendship because you've got some idiotic notion that this chick would even let you sniff her panties, let alone fuck her?!What the fuck.. WHAT THE FUCK MAKES THIS BITCH ALL THAT IMPORTANT?!?! Holden looks at Banky for a long beat.Fuck.Catholic school girls.The uniform is what does it for me. I wish I'd have went with more Catholic school girls when I was a kid. As it stands. I have no \"...and then she unzipped her jumper...\" stories.That's my couch you were fucking on.I wanted to watch some TV. Hard to do when your best friend's wrapped around a naked rug-muncher on your couch.This is all going to end badly.I know you. You're way too conservative for that girl. She's been around and seen things we've only read about in books.There's no 'we' here. You're going to have to go through this alone. And it's one thing to read about shit, and something different when you're forced to deal with it on a regular basis. When you guys are walking in the mall and both your heads turn at a really nice looking chick, it's going to eat you up inside. You'll spend most of your time wondering when the other shoe's going to drop. Because for you, this isn't about cool weird sex stuff, it's about love.Somehow I doubt it.Everybody has an agenda. Everyone.My agenda is to watch your back.To insure that all this time we've spent together, building something, wasn't wasted.I wasn't talking about the comic. I'm going to gel a bagel. Clean off my fucking couch so I can watch TV.Check out page forty eight.Did you see the nickname?And...?Do you know why it's 'Finger Cuffs'?I do. You remember Cohee Lundin? Left Hudson and went to North our senior year?Well, I ran into him at Food City the other day, and we got to talking, and I mentioned that you were dating Alyssa, and he said..Cohee's a lot of things, but an exxagerator he's not. The dude's Catholic.That's what she says. But I say her on her hands and knees getting filled out like an application constitutes 'being with a guy'.I'm getting your back, asshole! People don't forget shit like 'Finger Cuffs'. And if it got out that she's queer as well, how do you think it's going to make you look?Alright, forget about that; what if she's carrying a disease? That was just one story - what if there's more?What? Oh, it's not possible that she's all crudded up? Cohee I can vouch for as clean - the dude never got laid in high school. But Derris is an arch fucking bush-man! Name me one chick in our senior class that Rick Derris didn't nail, for Christ's sake!And I'm telling you, the bitch could be a bigger fucking germ farm than that monkey in 'Outbreak'!Maybe I'll put your fucking teeth down your throat.I've been working out you know! You better be ready to make that M-TV deal!The girl?I just figured you wanted to kill two birds with one stone by telling her to fuck off with me here so you didn't have to go through the story again later on.Not even if you let me videotape it.How perceptive.That's a nice way of putting it. I'd have said the whole double-stuff thing...What?Well, I've got to get home and catch the last few minutes of 'Babylon 5', so I'll be...Just 'cause a guy's got a predilection coward dick jokes...Sure.If you sell it, I want a kickbackThere was going to beYou're looking at it.

And right now it pays the bills. Just don't forget that we're better than this.You bet. We're at a Comic Book show, specifically at a book- signing. Behind Holden hangs a large banner, heralding HOLDEN McNEIL AND BANKY EDWARDS - CREATORS OF \u0011BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC'. Beside it is a large mock-up of the comic book cover which features two stoner super-heroes who bear a striking resemblance to a pair of very familiar friendly neighborhood drug dealers, Holden hands the book back to the Fan.I like to chink of them as \u0011Rosencrantz and Guildenstern' meet \u0011Vladimir and Estragon'.Who do I sign it to! Before Holden can finish, a loud crash is heard. He looks to his left and freaks. Banky is throttling the Collector from across the table. The Collector attempts to fight him off. SECURITY GUARDS pull them apart. Holden grabs Banky.Could you get him out of here! The Security Guards drag the collector away.Can I explain the audience principle to you! If you insult and accost them, then we have no audience.Need I remind you... Curtain's in ten minutes. INT. COMIC BOOK CONVENTION LECTURE HALL - DAY HOOPER fills the frame. He comes off like a typical, pro- black/anti-white homeboy.Bullshit! Lando Calrissian was a black man, and he got to fly the Millennium Falcon! Hooper whips his head around, looking for the source of the commentI did! Lando Calrissian is a positive black role model in the realm of Science Fiction/Fantasy.But Vader turns, out to be Luke's father. And in Jedi, they become friends.How do you manage to get away with this all the time? Shouldn't cops be busting your head open right about now?Your publisher condones these theatrics!Sorry about him. He's dealing with being an inker.I really enjoy your book I'm surprised we've never met at any other Con's before.We'll go. Banky offers Holden a puzzled glance. Then he nods to Hooper.He's got a point. Archie never did settle on Betty or Veronica.For years now. Started back in third grade - a nun was teaching us about the Blessed Trinity. She's going on about the three persons in one God thing - Father, Son, Holy Spirit - and he just goes ballistic. I guess it was too big for him to grasp. They got into this huge fight.You ever seen a nun call a small child a \u0011fucking cunt-rag'? Wasn't pretty, Shit like that's bound to happen when you make a kid wear a matching tie and slacks everyday.Limited to wine-tasting prior to mass. Turned me into a grade school alcoholic altar boy. I couldn't tell you how many mornings after serous benders I'd wake up next to strange priests.Sharp! No. I'm just a fan of clergy- molestation humor. Probably why the extended family quit inviting me to First Communion parties. Alyssa laughs. Holden smiles.Not professionally. You know - only in bars.It goes back to something my grandmother told me when I was a kid. \"Holden,\" she said \"The big bucks are in dick and fart jokes.\" She was a church-goer.I'm sorry - did I detect a note of bitter envy in there!It's all about marketing. Over- or underweight guys who don't get laid - they're our bread and butter. People like those two outside should be yours.And sadly, there are more of our core audience out there than yours. Look at that, though - kind of gives you a little charge, to see two people in love. And all over Banky's car, no less. That car's seeing more action right now than it's seen in years.You've gotta respect that kind of display of affection. It's crazy, rude, self-absorbed - but it's love.Says you.Fleeting.A story?'Doctor Zhivago'.Get out.Explain.In Pittsburgh.That is love.A stiff.Get out of here.Clever.At which time he marries the high school sweetheart and lives happily ever after.Someone wrote 'Fuck' inside his new steamer trunk.What kind of asshole writes that inside a steamer trunk!A hero's welcome for the new millionaire.That's a love story!!I should hope so. Jesus, that's the saddest tale I've ever heard.Those two aren't on the hood of Banky's car anymore.Huh! Oh. She left. She said she'd call you later.What!Who?She's alright.Mister Weatherbee wasn't really trying to fuck Archie, was he!It's the one across from the post office.Thanks. What do you wanna do tonight!You got a weird thing for Canadian melodrama.Bank-Hold-Up.Where is it?I don't know, Hoop. We're prepping the next issue, and we've got our big M-TV meeting in the morning.Told who?Alyssa from last night Alyssa?I'll be there.Hooper. He invited me to a club.Not that kind of a club.'We'? You can't go. He's setting me up with Alyssa.And I don't want you messing it up.I just told you - it's not that kind of club.How are you going to get home if I hook up!Let me explain something to you, my witless chum the other night in that bar, we two - Alyssa and I shared a moment, alright!We shared a moment. And in that moment, one thing was made abundantly clear: this girl loves me, my friend. Loves-me.Where is she?She's got a boyfriend.Then what's to know?Hey, hey, hey - you fucked up my cabbage-patch!Call me flattered. I heard you sent me the invite to this little soiree'.You're saying you're from the 'burbs!Get out of here! I'm from Highlands!How is it that we never ran into one another?Yeah. Eighty eight.What a small fucking world. So you know the tri-town area!Miller Hill?Sandy Hook?This is so cool. The mall!Wait - here's the big test: Quick Stop!You know that girl!!You know what this is! This is fate.I was talking about us meeting - what are the chances!The Quick Stop girl died!Y.M.C.A pool! Damn! You knew her too!One friend in an asylum, the other friend in the grave. You're a dangerous person to know.Very solid.Two towns away from each other for years and we had to meet in New York.That's rude.Sorry. It's just... new to him.Would you shut up!!I don't know how many times I can apologize for him.Here we go.As stupid as you usually come off during this diatribe of your's, you're going to come off ten times as stupid on this occasion.You're such an idiot.Holy shit, is that the time. We've gotta beat traffic.And rush hour starts in six hours. Let's go. Thanks for inviting us out. It was... educational.Lower your voice.I'm sure the gay community appreciates your support.I don't think it's a good idea.The cartoon.Is this how you want to be remembered! As the guy who created Bluntman and Chronic!But it'll be all glossy and main- stream. We'll lose any artistic credibility we ever had.I'll give it some thoughtI'm retarded! This from the guy who only forty five minutes ago paid fifty bucks for what's supposed to be a boot- leg of 'March of the Wooden Soldiers' with a deleted scene of Stan Laurel wearing a French Tickler.Twelve episodes.Banky seems to think so.I don't know if that's the perception I want people to have of our stuff. I know this sounds pretentious as hell, but I like to think of us as artists. And I'd like to get back to doing something more personal - like our first book.As soon as we have something personal to say.What?Uh... thanks.I didn't say anything.Sure. Harrison Ford. And our mail- man.Huh! No, not really.It's just that we've.., I mean, I've never seen that kind of thing up close and personal. It just took awhile to process, longer than usual.Um. If you want to.Why girls?Because that's the standardIt's more than that.Curious about men? Well... I always wondered why my father watched 'Hee- Haw'.No.No interest.Girls feel right.Wait, wait, wait - you're still a virgin?But you've only been with girls.Isn't that the standard definition?With a member of the opposite sex.Because that's the standard.Of course not.Okay, I'll revise. Virginity is lost when the hymen is broken.Second revision - virginity is lost through penetration.Emotional?Physical penetration.Yeah, but not real sex.Well where's the penetration in lesbian sex.A finger? Come on. I've had my finger in my ass but I wouldn't say I've had anal sex.You're kidding?!?! How...?!?But doesn't it hurt?!What about not-so-special occasions?But how can that be enough? I mean, let's be real - how big can a tongue even get?Just...uh... just give me a moment.Look at you. It's a two day trip.We're going to a convention, for the love of God. We'll be busy from ten 'till eight each day. When are you possibly going to have time for any of that shit? In fact, fuck it - you're leaving some of this shit here in a locker. Come on - give me the two that aren't clothes.What are you doing?Who are you, Larry fucking Flynt? What are you going to do with all of those?You've got like thirty books there! We're only there for two days!Go check us in. I've gotta call Alyssa.Put that stuff away.What's up? I'm about to get on a plane.Last minute invite to the Dragon Con'.What?The one that wrote the book?You didn't get invited to the Con'?Well this sucks. You know - both of us don't have to go.Yeah. Banky can go by himself. It's not like we're on a panel. It was just a signing appearance.Where's your apartment?I'll be there in half an hour.What are you doing?Listen to me - I'm not going. You're going to have to do this one by yourself.Alyssa's coming down for the weekend, so I want to hang out with her. You don't need me for this. Meantime, I'll take this stuff home. You can keep the filth. I'll pick you up at nine Sunday night, alright? Don't forget to plug the Annual and don't mention the t.v. show, okay? Call me if you get bored.Excuse me?I'm Holden, by the way.Look, we're just friends.And how do you know men so well?Who was that?Why would you want to hang our with someone bitter as that?Yeah. You?Really? Did you have a strict upbringing?You think your upbringing had something to do with your lifestyle choice?Shoes?Come in.I'll be ready in a second. I just have to school this mouthy second-stringer.What? Do something!Look at how slow you are. Christ, you move like a geriatric.Oh. It's the controller, right? It's always the controller.Final sixty of the third.Imagine if I'd only beaten him by one instead of thirty.How could you have grown up down the shore and never played skee-ball? What did you do with your youth?Not your grade school years; your high school years.The premise is very basic - you roll the ball up the ramp at varying speeds, in an effort to pop it into the score circles. The higher the score, the more prize tickets you get.Trade them in for prizes that aren't worth nearly as much as you paid to play the game.It's fun.Observe.See? It's just that simple.Where's the skill in that?Just toss one.I'm sorry, man. She's new at this.Thank you. Underhand. Throw it underhand.It's like Spanish Fly. This'll probably be the first time I don't score afterwards.So what'd you do last night?Maybe we should just leave before somebody gets hurt.He just feels left out, I think.I thought he was talking to you.He was just pissed he was losing.C'mon. Don't get all p.c. on me.It says he gets too easily frustrated.How do you figure?I think you're reading too much into it.You're blowing this way out of proportion. We live in a more tolerant age now. You refer to yourself as a dyke. Hooper calls himself a faggot all the time...How bad do you suck!Leave it alone.Aww. Everyone bugs you.You know, you should watch that. If you're going to get all bent out of shape while playing the game, so much so that you need to curse the t.v., try not to gay-bash it, alright. You're nor that kind of guy. And don't call her a dyke, alright? She's a lesbian.I'm starting a new page.We're friends.I beg your pardon? Programming?It's passive/aggressive gay-bashing; and I know you're not really prejudiced at heart. You should just find some other way to express your anger, is all I'm saying.What the fuck are you doing!What is this supposed to prove?The man-hating dyke.I don't know.I don't need this. I'm going home.And why would she need to do that? What is she Mata fucking Hari?! What does she gain?You're so out of line right now..,Watch your fucking mouth, is all I'm going to tell you..Sometimes your paranoia and suspicious bullshit is amusing. Sometimes it's just fucking annoying as piss!I think you should let this one go.Let it go...I'm in love with her, man.I wish you were the one being pursued by M-TV.Sure. Then you could sell our and maybe pick up the check once in awhile.Well it's not like this is a bed and breakfast,Tell me you're kidding!I've always wondered what kind of people buy those things. I can't believe you talked him down to twenty five!Where are you going to hang it?You want me to hang it for you? You better hope it doesn't get out to the girl-nation that you needed a man to help you hang a picture.Yeah, right.Why?Because I can't take it.I love you.I love you. And not in a friendly way, although I think we're great friends. And not in a misplaced affection, puppy-dog way, although I'm sure that's what you'll call it. And it's not because you're unattainable. I love you. Very simple, very truly. You're the epitome of every attribute and quality I've ever looked for in another person. I know you think of me as just a friend and crossing that line is the furthest thing from an option you'd ever consider. But I can't do this any longer. I can't stand next to you without wanting to hold you. I can't look into your eyes without feeling that longing you only read about in trashy romance novels. I can't talk to you without wanting to express my love for everything you are. I know this will probably queer our friendship - no pun intended - but I had to say it, because I've never felt this before, and I like who I am because of it. And if bringing it to light means we can't hang out anymore, then that hurts me. But I couldn't allow another day to go by without getting it out there, regardless of the outcome, which by the look on your face is to be the inevitable shoot- down. And I'll accept that But I know some part of you is hesitating for a moment, and if there is a moment of hesitation, that means you feel something too. All I ask is that you not suppress that - at least for ten minutes - and try to dwell in it before you dismiss it. There isn't another soul on this fucking planet who's ever made me the person I am when I'm with you, and I would risk this friendship for the chance to take it to the next plateau. Because it's there between you and me. You can't deny that. And even if we never speak again after tonight, please know that I'm forever changed because of you and what you've meant to me, which - while I do appreciate it - I'd never need a painting of birds bought at a diner to remind me of.Was it something I said?What are you doing?You're going to hitch to New York?Aren't you at least going to comment?Why?It's unfair that I'm in love with you?So? People change.But that's every relationship! There's always going to be a period of adjustment.If this is a crush... then I don't know if I could take the real thing if it ever happens.Stay here.You looked weirded out back there.Sorry.She had boxers on.You don't know that.But we have read about them. So we're prepared.Maybe it is for her as well.Everyone's not out to get someone in life. Bank.Yourself?To what end?She's not going to ruin the comic.Can I ask you something?Why me - you know? Why now?You know what I'm talking about.I'm a guy. You're attracted to girls.Then why this?Still am.Shit.Well, you took the luster our of it.Of how I brought you back from the other side. How all you needed was the right man to turn you around.Can I at least cell people that all you needed was some serious deep- dicking?So?'Finger Cuffs'.And... she had a weird nick-name. What's your point?I suppose you do.Yeah.He's full of shit.She's never even been with a guy.He's pulling your chain. And the fact that you even bought it for a second makes you look like an idiot.I give a shit what people think.You're such a fucking asshole.Would you let this go? I'm telling you - she's never even been with a guy, let alone those two zeroes.Give it a rest! Do you hear me?! I'm tired of this shit! She's my goddamn girlfriend, do you understand?! Show her a little fucking respect! And if you ever even so much as mention that Alyssa looks a little peaked from now on, I'll put your fucking teeth down your throat!Not bloody Likely.Sulking. He's having a real problem with this Alyssa thing.Banky does not hate gays, you know that.You make it sound like me and him were dating.He's been digging up dirt on Alyssa.He heard some bullshit story that she took on two guys.Have it. Actually, it's kind of gotten to me.Banky's not known for believing misinformation. He's got a pretty good bullshit detector.Sex with multiple partners?At the same time.Thanks for being so comforting.Well that's the thing, isn't it? I shouldn't.. but it gets to me.You see - that doesn't bother me. But the thought of her and guys... Uh!Which is?Do I detect a little inter-subculture cattiness?I thought fags were all supposed to be super-supportive of one another.Three strikes.What do you mean?I can accept that.What do you mean, 'visitors'?So that was until recently!So nobody bur me has stayed the night at your place since we got together?No, I was just wondering,Look, I was just asking.That'd make Banky half right.He said all the girls from North were bitches and sluts.How about your yearbook.What's with 'Finger Cuffs'?Yeah. In your senior yearbook your nickname was 'Finger Cuffs'. What is that?Do you know Rick Derris?Did you go out with him or something?Just... you and him?Cohee?Rick pulled his dick out? Really? What'd you do?Excuse me!?!So it's true?!How the hell could you do those things?!How am I supposed to feel about all of this?I don't know how I feel about you now.Some sex?There's a world of fucking difference between typical high school sex and two guys at once! They fucking used you?I want us to be something that we can't.A normal couple.What took you so long?How'd a dirt merchant like you ever learn about likeness rights?I'll pass. Take a look at the issue.I'll see what I can do.Nothing, thanks.When is he not? No - I'm just having some girl trouble.No. I'm just at a point where I don't know what to do.Can't do it, g. I'm in love.Just what I needed - advice from the 'hoodI don't think you know her.You sound like Barbra Streisand.I'm telling you, you don't know her.Alyssa Jones.She is. Or was. I don't know.It's not like that.Right now? I don't know. I love her. But she has a pastEat your fucking bagel already!The problem is shit like that. It was one thing when it was just girls - that was weird enough. But now you throw guys into the mix - two guys at once, no less. All that experience...What am I supposed to think?Settling. That's comforting, Jay. Thanks.I'm lust having a problem with all of it I can't get it out of my head these visuals of her doing all this shit. And I don't know why I can't let it go. Because I'm crazy about her, you know? I look at this girl, I see the future. I see kids. I see grand- kids.I'm scaring myself. Because I think so much of her, and then I can't get over shit like 'Finger Cuffs'. I don't know what I'm doing.What..what did you say?What's there?I don't know. I don't know if the book's going to be around much longer.Are you kidding me? There's millions of people out there that'd love to see themselves in a comic book.Snootchie-bootchies.I'll try.I know you're wondering why I asked you both here tonight, at the same time, knowing that we have shit to settle between us, separately.Enough! I've been going through things, over and over. And I dissected it all, and looked at it a thousand different ways. Banky - there's friction between us for the first time in our lives. You hate me dating Alyssa and you want me to sign off on this M-TV thing.Alyssa - you and I hit a wall, because I don't know how to deal with... your past, I guess.I'm only going to say it once: shut up. Now - I know I'm to blame one way or the other on both accounts. With you, Alyssa - it's my fault because I feel inadequate. Because you've had so much experience, had such a big life; and my life's been pretty small in comparison.Please. I have to get through this. And with you Banky - I know why you're having such a hard time with Alyssa, and it's something that's been obvious forever, but I guess I just didn't acknowledge it. You're in love with me.You're attracted to me. Just as, in a way, I'm attracted to you. I mean, it makes sense - we've been together so long, we have so much in common...It's something you're going to have to deal with. Bank. You may very well be gay, which explains your homophobia and why you're so jealous of Alyssa, and your sense of humor as well.Bank. Stop. Deal with it. You'll feel much better.Now - at this point, you may be asking yourself the question that I've been going over and over in my head for the last few days: what does one have to do with the other?And when I did some serious soul- searching, it came at me from out of nowhere, and suddenly it all made sense - a calm came over me. I know what we have to do. And then you - Bank, you Alyssa, and I - all of us... can finally be... alright.We've all got to have sex together.Don't you see? That would take care of everything. Alyssa - I wouldn't feel inadequate or too conservative anymore. I'll have done something on par with all the experience you've had. And it'll be with you, which'll make it that much more powerful. And Banky - you can cake that leap that everyone else but you sees that you should take. And it'll be okay, because it'll be with me - your best friend for years. We've been everything to each other but intimates. And now, we'll have been through that together too. And it won't have to be a total leap for you, because a woman will be involved. And when it's over, all that aggression you feel toward Alyssa will be gone. Because you'll have shared in something beautiful with the woman I love. It'll be cathartic. A true communion. We have to do this. For me, for both of you... for all of our sakes. This will keep us together. What do you say?You know I need this. You know it'll help.No? I... I thought you'd be into this.But you've... you've done... stuff... like this. This should be no big deal for you.I need this. This has to happen. Why can't you see that? And how can you not? What does that say about me? You can take it from two guys whose names you can barely remember, but I ask you to share an experience like it - where it's about intimacy - and you say no?You can. I'll be there. And when it's over, we'll be the strongest we've ever been because we got through some nasty shit together. And we'll finally be on the same level together. And then there'll be nothing we can't accomplish.No it won't. I thought about all of that.I saved you one.Hi.Good. Really good. Yourself?Because it's so good. I really liked it.A month ago. I did a really small run. Self-financed. Only about five hundred issues.You might. It's familiar subject matter.I finally had something personal to say.I'm going to go. I don't want to hold up the line.Read that, when you have a minuteI'd like to hear your thoughts about it. If you get a chance, give me a call.Nice seeing you again,", "clean_line": "yippee know easy alright right pays bills forget better bet comic book specifically book signing holden hangs large banner

"...and the King of Pop when you're nor.Always before I get to speak! I swear - the next con I attend and they ask me to be on the minority panel, if I see your name anywhere near the List, I'm passing.I just wish I was the one who gets to shoot you.Oh. You trace! Banky seethes.Lose the dick or change your skin tone and we can get to know each other on panel after panel while the Pink Black Panther here plays Chuck D. for the fanboys.Is he always Like that!Please. How bad could it have been!And your parochial school misadventures!Aren't you the sharp wit!You play darts!So your new book seems to be selling like mad.Uh-oh - the cry from the heart of a real artist trapped in commercial hell - pitying his good fortune. I'm sure you can dry your eyes on all those fat checks you rake in.Nope. I'm happy my stuff gets read at all. There's very little market for hearts and flowers in this spandex- clad, big pecs, big tits, big guns field. If I sell two issues, I feel like John Grisham.Bubbly guy like that, it's hard to figure out why.That's not love.That out there! That's fleeting.Uh-huh. You wanna hear about love! Oh, I'll tell you about love.The story. The original love story.Nope. My mother's uncle. He was a millionaire.I kid you not.All through high school, he dated this one girl. They were inseparable. And when they graduated, she went off to Carnegie Mellon...I'm impressed. So he stays in the home town, and they begin their long- distance relationship. The plan is, on the third Sunday of every month, he'll train out, spend a week then train back They do this for four years.Not nearly finished. Two months before she's going to graduate, he's got this job digging graves, and he comes across...A steamer trunk containing silver ingots.Many, many silver ingots. Now, my mother's uncle being quite the ingenious chap - he buries the trunk again and heads up to the main office, where he proceeds to purchase a cemetery plot. Guess which one?So now he owns the plot and all of its contents. Two days later, my mother's uncle is worth three million.Not even close. Inside the steamer trunk, stenciled into the wood, or something like that, is a curse.Not that kind of curse. A cryptic curse \"Great fortune means great loss\" it said.The same kind of asshole that buries silver ingots. The day my mother's uncle is heading out to see the girl, he stops at his accountant's to grab some cash, and winds up missing his train. So he has to take the next one - which he does - and he gets there an hour later than his usual time of arrival, whereupon he sees lights.It seems that while she was standing on the platform waiting that extra hour for my mother's uncle to show up, the girl was dragged into the bushes by an unknown assailant, raped and gutted.The assailant was never apprehended.Yes, and here's why: my mother's uncle rode that train every day for the rest of his life. One day up, the next day back. Did that 'till the day he died. He donated the fortune he'd acquired to the train station in Pittsburgh, to have a well-lit terminal built. The train line let him ride for free after that.That's my love story.I told you It wasn't love. I gotta split. It was really nice meeting you. I wish you the best of luck with your book. Tell Hooper I'll call him later. And tell your friend to calm down.Well, well, well - Bluntman himself. Or should I call you Chronic!From a former home-town girl, to Mister Home-Town himself.Middletown, N.J.I know. Hooper told me.You graduate from Hudson?I went to North. Also eighty eight.Quiz me.I wrote my name on the wall.Lost my virginity there.Eden Prairie of Menlo Park!My best friend fucked a dead guy in the back room.I did. Before she was committed.No, this is the 'Rog'.Pretty slim. I haven't been back to the 'burbs since my friend's funeral.Another friend - Julie Dwyer. She died in the..So well.But I can tap. That was the Buffalo Two-Step.That's what six years of tap lessons yields.Coulda been worse - we could have not met at all.She is such a twat.Alright. I should dedicate this, right? This is for that special someone our there.Uh-oh - better knock it off: we're getting a man excited.No, I should apologize. I don't usually get all mushy in public. But it's been awhile since I've seen Kim here.Like I'd have to go through that much effortGo ahead. I'll watch from here.Don't be such a rag. I have to sit here and work up the desire to fuck you later.Yes?And?It's okay. Secretly, all I really want is to be the center of attention. I've never used a snap-on.Let me ask you a question - can men 'fuck' each other!In your estimation.So for you, to 'fuck' means to penetrate. You're used to the more traditional definition - you inside some girl you've duped, jack-hammering away, not noticing that bored look in her eyes.'Fucking' is nor limited to penetration, Banky. For me it describes any sex when it's not totally about love. I don't love Kim, but I'll fuck her. I'm sure you don't love every girl you sleep with.But I'll bet it's different with the ones you love. I'll bet you go the full nine when it's not just a quick fix - like you go down on them longer or something.What?!?!If you say the smell, so help me, I'll slug you.At least you blame yourself for your sexual inadequacies.No, he's got a point. That's how I was in high school - I was nervous, and inhibited about being eaten out. But by the time I got to college, that all changed. I loosened up. Not only did I learn to communicate - I learned to be bossy. I was like one of those guys at the airport with those big flash lights - waving them this way, directing them that way, telling them when to stop.Permanent injuries?I got that beat. I got that beat. Sophomore year. I'm going down on Cynthia Slater in her dorm room after we went club-hopping. I'm totally drunk, and in the middle of it, I fall asleep - right there in her lap. She got so mad, she digs her heel into my back, right there. That's permanent.Senior year. Spring Formal. I'm eating our Missy Kurt in her brother's car. She's laying across the back seat, and I'm half-hanging out of the car, my knees on the ground. She's flailing around, and she knocks the parking brake off. The car starts rolling down the hill, and my right knee is cut up all to shit like a kiddy's scissor class cut it up for paper dolls.Somebody told me that they make comic books here, and I've got an idea for this story about a guy who comes to a club and high-tails it when he finds out this girl is pay. Any interest in a story like that!M-TV?That's great, isn't it?But you don't.Well when are you going to do that?Do you know how pretty you are?You're a pretty man.Oh. I get it. I'm into girls, so I have to find all men repulsive or something.Aren't there some men that you find attractive? Granted, not enough to sleep with, but still - just handsome or something!Well it's the same thing. I look at you and just find you really handsome. And you know, it has very little to do with your look, per-se. Your look is fine, don't get me wrong. But it's more your outlook. The things you say, the way you see things. It's... I don't know... attractive,I weirded you our the other nightCome on.Do you want to talk about it!I like you. I haven't liked a man in a long time. And I'm not a man-hater or something. It's just been some time since I've been exposed to a man that didn't immediately live-into a stereotype of some sort. And I want you to feel comfortable with me, because I want us to be friends. So if there are things you'd like to know, it's okay to ask me.Why men?If that's the only reason you're attracted to women - because it's the standard..So you've never been curious about men?You know what I mean.Why not!Because...?And that's how I feel. I've never really been attracted to men. I'm more comfortable with the idea of girls.No.You're saying a person's a virgin until they've had intercourse with a member of the opposite sex?Again with the standards. I think virginity is lost when you make love for the first time.Why? Why only then?So if a virgin is raped, then she's still a virgin?But rape is not the standard. So she's had sex, but not the standard idea of sex. Hence, according to your definition, she'd still be a virgin.Then I lost my virginity at ten, because I fell on a fence post when I was ten, and it broke my hymen. Now I have to tell people that I lost it to a wooden post I'd known my whole young life?Physical penetration or emotional?Well, I fell in love hard with Caitlin Bree when we were in high school.We had sex.I move to have that remark stricken from the record. On account of it makes you come off as completely naive and infantile.Did I hold up a finger?Our bodies are built to pass a child, for Christ's sake.Sure. But in a good way. And it's only a once-in-awhile thing - reserved for really special occasions.Tongue only.Let's go.Come on.I hope for the sake of the women you've dated that you're only this quick in returning calls.Ohhh. Why!Shit.My sister's at my parents'. I was gonna go see her.Yeah. But I was staying all weekend, and I wanted to hang our with you. This sucks.I don't do southern con's - all the chicks have that annoying drawl. You know how hard it is nor to laugh when someone moans \"Fuhhk me\"?Really?If you come pick me up, I'll be your best friend.I'm not there. I'm at a friend's - in the Village. Corner of Houston and Mercer. Number eighty six, apartment 6-D.You're so easy.Don't mind her. That's just her way a saying hello.You're such an asshole.Ohhh - you look so cute!Just an occasional friend.Remember this! Her's is even bigger than that.You were raised Catholic, right?Baptist.Please There was no time to be bad - we were too busy saying 'Jesus'.Somewhere along the line. It's a gradual transition to make - from doing what the majority does to taking a leap of faith and doing what feels more natural. Everything helps - from the way you were handled as a kid, to the way the boys acted in third grade, to the shoes you wore at your freshman prom.Well they were really tight.I read somewhere that guys who play hockey are merely making up for penile deficiencies by carrying big sticks.Explain this again.Stayed out late, smoked pot, screwed around.This looks complicated.What do you do with the prize tickets?Then what's the point?And you question my lifestyle.Why not just walk up there and put it in the fifty every time?Oh, this is a skill? I'm sorry, I had no idea.This is where you take straight chicks on dates?I don't know. I'm starting to get a tingle in my bottom. Ten.Got laidSome more of that skill you were telling me about?No way. I want a cheap prize. So your friend's quite the homophobe.I'm not talking about his infantile hang-up with me. I'm talking about when you two were playing that game. Everytime he swore - when his players messed up, he called them cocksuckers, he referred to the players as queers, he called you a cock-teaser...I know you think it means nothing, and it may in fact be unintentional, but it's ugly all the same.So he slams the gay community?I'm not. But what is that saying?It's passive/agressive gay-bashing.How casually did it roll off his tongue? And that's how he expresses his anger? By calling people faggots?I think you're just so used to it that it rolls off your back. I've heard the two of you play your little rank out game where one insists the other is gay. \"You're a faggot. No, you're a faggot.\" It's cute and all to watch you go at it like grade-schooler, but it's also offensive - labeling and ducking the label of being gay as if it were the scarlet fucking letter.Yeah, but that's what's known as empowerment/disempowerment. I call myself a dyke so it's not too devastating when some throwback screams it at me as I'm leaving a bar at night. Same for Hooper - by calling himself a faggot, he steals the thunder away from the mouthy jerks of this world who'd like to beat him to it. But the difference between us having it and your friend saying it is miles wide. We say it to mask the pain - you say it for lack of a better expression at any given moment. No Holden, we do not live in a more tolerant age. And if you think that's the case, then you've been in the suburbs way too long to be resuscitated.But you know what? I have more faith in you than that. Come on - I want my cheap prize.Oh really?We're leaving!I've got a little business to conduct.Are you an authorized deal-maker in this establishment? Do you have the power to negotiate.I want to haggle over the price of fine art.There. By the kitchen. That painting.The price tag says seventy five.I'll give you fifty.Alyssa Jones. Pleased to meet you.I'm only trying to conduct a transaction. We're not opponents.Ah-ha! Now we're haggling.It was looking shakey when he told me the artist was a blind cripple with a hump-back, but I held my ground. There's no room for sympathy in the buyer's market.I'm not. You are.You're going to hang it in your house. I bought it for you.I'm serious.Because it's captured the moment. It'll be a constant reminder - not just of tonight, but of our introduction, the building of our friendship, everything. Make no mistake about it my Friend - it's a gift to you, from me, so you'll always remember us.Why are we stopping?Can't take what?You love me.Get back in the car and get out of here.Y'ep.Here's my comment fuck you.That was so unfair. You know how unfair that was.No, it's unfortunate that you're in love with me. It's unfair that you felt the fucking need to unburden your soul about it. Do you remember for a fucking second who I am?Oh, it's that simple? You fall in love with me and want a romantic relationship, nothing changes for you with the exception of feeling hunky- dorey all the time. But what about- me? It's not that simple, is it? I can't just get into a relationship with you without throwing my whole fucking world into upheaval!Period of adjustment?!? THERE'S NO 'PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT' HOLDEN! I'M FUCKING GAY! THAT'S WHO I AM! AND YOU ASSUME I CAN TURN THAT AROUND JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A CRUSH?!?Go home, Holden.I take it that's not good.And miss these last minute cram sessions with my nearest and dearest? Never.'Shacking up!' Please. I'm so in love!I know. I know -I feel like such a goon. But I can't help it - we have such a great time together.It's not her. It's someone you guys don't know.They're not. From around here.For your information, they don't have big hair or wear acid wash. They're from my home town.What? What are you talking about? I'm not even.Holden.He's not like a typical man. He's really sweet to me, and we relate so well. You guys'd love him, really.Don't even tell me you want to do it again.Because you were giving me that look, and I got wet...Why not You?I see you've been taking notes. Historically, yes that's true.I've given that a lot of thought, you know? I mean, now that I'm being ostracized by my friends, I've had a lot of time to think about all of this. And what I've come up with is really simple: I came to this on my terms. I didn't just heed what I was taught, you know? Men and women should be together, it's the natural way - that kind of thing. I'm not with you because of what family, society, life tried to instill in me from day one. The way the world is - how seldom you meet that one person who gets you... it's so rare. My parents didn't really have it. There was no example set for me in the world of male/female relation ships. And to cut oneself off from finding that person - to immediately half your options by eliminating the possibility of finding that one person within your own gender... that just seemed stupid. So I didn't. And by leaving my options open, I was branded 'gay', which to me was no big deal - labels are labels, you know? They define what you do, not who you are, I guess. But then you come along. You - the one least likely; I mean, you were a guy.And while I was falling for you, I put a ceiling on that, because you were a guy. Until I remembered why I opened the door to women in the first place - to not limit the likelihood of finding that one person who'd compliment me so completely. And so here we are, I was thorough when I looked for you, and I feel justified lying in your arms - because I got here on my terms, and have no question that there was someplace I didn't look. And that makes all the difference.What?What luster?You're not the right man. You're just the one.Since most of these people are rooting for the home team, I'm going to cheer for the visitors. I'm a big visitors fan - especially the kind that make coffee for you in the morning before they go. That was a joke. A little wacky wordplay?Was I being too obscure? The kind that - until recently - had no dicks and would spend the night.Oh, yeah. Hey - foul! Foul! He was traveling or something!Something on your mind, Holden?If I've been 'faithful' or something?Oh, sweetie. I only have eyes for you. CALL THAT FUCKING SHIT, REF!! THE GUY ON THE SKATES TOTALLY SHOVED ONE OF MYAbout what?Really. I'm sorry - you two left high school behind how many years ago? Can I put some of my books in your locker?IF YOU DON'T START USING THAT WHISTLE I'M GONNA JAM IT STRAIGHT UP YOUR'Finger Cuffs'?It was? Shit, damned if I can remember. I'd look it up, but I threw all that shit our years ago? Where'd you see a North yearbook?Rick? Sure. We used to hang out in high school. PUNCH HIM IN THE FUCKING NECK, NUMBER TWELVE!!Date Rick Derris? No. We just hung out a lot.No. Me, Rick, and... um... what was that guy's name...?Yeah! Cohee Lundin. God, I haven't thought about that name in years.I remember those guys'd come over almost everyday after school. They'd bug my sisters, look for porno tapes in my dad's closet, raid our fridge. They really took advantage of my parents never being home.This one day... Rick pulled out his dick and chased me around the house with it! Right in front of Cohee! I couldn't believe it! Guys are weird - I thought the whole size hang-up made you all terrified to show your dicks to each other?I blew him while Cohee fucked me.That's what you wanted to hear, isn't it? Isn't that what this little cross- examination of your's is about? Well try not to be so obvious about it next time, there are subtler ways of badgering a witness. Am I right?If you wanted some background information on me, all you had to do was ask - I'd have gladly volunteered it. You didn't have to play Hercules fucking Poirot!Yes Holden! In fact, everything you heard or dug up on me was probably true! Yeah, I took on two guys at once! You want to hear some gems you might not have unearthed - I took a twenty six year old guy to my senior prom, and then left halfway through to have sex with him and Gwen Turner in the back of a limo! And the girl who got caught in the shower with Miss Moffit, the gym teacher? That was me! Or how about in college, when I let Shannon Hamilton videotape us having sex - only to find out the next day that he broadcast it on the campus cable station?! They're all true - those and so many more! Didn't you know? I'm the queen of urban legend!Easily! Some of it I did out of stupidity, some of it I did out of what I thought was love, but - good or bad - they were my choices, and I'm not making apologies for them now - not to you or anyone! And how dare you try to lay a guilt trip on me about it - in public, no less! Who the fuck do you think you are, you judgemental prick?!How are you supposed to feel about it? Feel what ever the fuck you want about it! The only thing that really matters is how you feel about me.Why? Because I had some sex?Yes, Holden - that's all it was: some sex! Most of it stupid high school sex, for Christ's sake! Like you never had sex in high school!I used them! You don't think I would've let it happen if I hadn't wanted it to, do you?! I was an experimental girl, for Christ's sake! Maybe you knew early on that your track was from point 'a' to 'b' - but unlike you I wasn't given a fucking map at birth, so I tried it all! That is until we - that's you and I - got together, and suddenly, I was sated. Can't you take some fucking comfort in that? You turned out to be all I was ever looking for - the missing piece in the big fucking puzzle! Look I'm sorry I let you believe that you were the only guy I'd ever been with. I should've been more honest. But it seemed to make you feel special in a way that me telling you over and over again how incredible you are would never get across.Do you mean to tell me that - while you have zero problem with me sleeping with half the women in New York City - you have some sort of half-assed, mealy-mouthed objection to pubescent antics, that took place almost ten years ago? What the fuck is your problem?!?And what's that?Fuck you.That doesn't matter to me...Don't.Please don't say it.No.You did? What does that say about me?You don't want this. You really don't want this. Trust me.I can't.Oh Holden. That time is over for me. I've been there. I've done it. And I didn't find what I was looking for in any of it. I found that in you - in us. Doing this won't help you forget about the things you're hung up on. It'll create more.No, it will. Maybe you'll see me differently from then on - maybe you'll despise me for going along with it, once you're in the moment. Maybe I'll moan differently and then you'll resent Banky, and become suspicious of us. Or you'll alienate him because of it, and then grow to blame and hate me for the deterioration of your friendship. Or what if- I sincerely doubt it, but what if - I saw something in Banky that I never saw before, and fell in love with him and left you. I've been down roads like this before; many times. I know you feel doing this will broaden your horizons and give you experience. But I've had those experiences on my own. I can't accompany you on your's. I'm past that now. Or maybe I just love you too much. And I feel hurt and let down that you'd want to share me with anyone. Because I never wanted to share you Regardless I can't be a part of this. Or you. Not anymore I love you. I always will. Know that.But I'm not your fucking whore.He's your's again.Thanks for reading it.I'm fine, thanks,Okay, who's next!Um...
