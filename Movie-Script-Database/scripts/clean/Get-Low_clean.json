{"Get-Low": {"BUSH": {"raw_line": "Hard life if you can't read..Don't need saving, preacher.Yeah, well.. Bush returns to chopping wood. Feeling awkward, Horton hesitates, starts for his car, stops.I talked him into it. Bush doesn't turn, just keeps chopping.Well hell..Always thought you'd go first.. White as cotton, Bush stares into the lamp that is running out of oil, the light fading fast to darkness. Thoughts tumble through his mind, troubling him, stirring the dark waters of memory.Ahh, don't look so disappointed.You better not. Mule looks back, sees an apple in Bush's hand, and stops.And coffee when we get there.I can wait. Buddy and Kathryn see Horton and double-take Bush. Buddy nods to Horton and he and Kathryn step back into the vestibule to give Bush and Horton privacy.Bout time for me to get low.Down to business Bush reaches into his overalls and puts a balled-up wad of MONEY on the pew. Horton's eyes bulge.Need a funeral. Horton looks up from the money.Me. Buddy peers around from the vestibule, listening, curious as hell, until Kathryn pulls him back.Am I not talking right?Everybody dies.I don't take care of my bones it won't get done, will it?What would you say?Say what you'd say right now to my face.What stories? Bush leans in and stares into Horton. It feels like everything in the world stops dead. Buddy peeks in again, this time Kathryn peeks too.What kind of stories? Say one.Nothing in this world is free, preacher.Want to see in my house, do you? BOOM! Bush blows away several windowpanes and re-aims at Buddy's head.How's it look? Buddy closes his eyes, his last words are for his wife..What the hell you doing here?What? They stand there while Buddy thinks..Funeral?Yes sir. I work at uh.. I work at.. .Quinn Funeral Home. I thought I could help you. Bush glances at his blown out window: 'Damn'. He lowers his gun, walks up onto the porch.Sit down. There is only chair at the table so Buddy dumps the glass off a small stool under the window and sits down low. The wonder of not being dead makes him look at everything with new eyes. On a window sill he sees a beautiful little CARVED MULE emerging from a block of wood.It's how you put things together, see? Some things go, some things never will. Indians said that everything spoke to them. That's how they made medicine and knew what to eat. Things talked to them clear as we talk. You believe that?If you don't listen you won't hear nothing. Bush puts the big skillet on the table and sits down. Buddy is so low he can look under the table and sees how the table legs run right into the top without screws or nails.Magic. Buddy looks up. Bush is dead serious. The word lingers. Finally..What'd everybody say about what happened in town?That crazy old son of a bitch tried to beat a man to death for no reason? That it?People say that. But they don't mean it. They think what they think and they don't want to know anything else.Like life after dying. Heaven.Ya'll know lots of stories about me?Tell one.I rather you did.Is that all? Bush leans back stone-faced. In the silence, Buddy looks over again at the wondrous carving of the mule on the window sill, at the big ears and long face that are being born from the rough block. It makes him smile. But when he glances back, Bush is staring a hole through him.Leave it.You from anywhere?I'm after a funeral.Forget the box. What else?No.Got it.Party.A party.Funeral party. Stumped for once in his life, Frank looks at Buddy. Then years of honed instincts surge back to life.And I want to be there. Frank goes behind his desk. Buddy and Bush start to sit..I want to be there now.Yes or no?Sit down. Buddy sits right down.I want everybody to come who's got a story to tell about me.Then I want 4 counties worth of people at the party.Hey Mattie. Buddy comes out, surprised to see Mattie and Bush together. Frank walks up behind him and scowls. Kathryn steers them back inside to give Mattie privacy.Heard you moved off.You look like you always did. He abruptly rips himself away and is gone.What for?How much is it gonna cost?It moves, don't it?Fancy car for the dead.Don't leave me naked.Why you want my picture made?And you want me to look like this?Why?So a crazy old nutter draws more.Do you ever say what you mean? Bush rips the bib off as Tollerude whooshes him to the floor.He's paying. As Bush blows out the door, Mr. Tollerude leans against the chair with relief.Maybe the Devil won't either. Might work out.Don't wear none.She's a peach. Frank and Buddy cut Bush a look. He looks ahead.We had a go. Frank nearly drives off the road.I am. Bush is surprised by the sound of his own voice.I dreamed it.Why would I make that up? Two seconds of dead air as the announcer finds his feet.I got pruned.Like what?You come and tell yours.40 some years.First 38 are the hardest.Come to the funeral and maybe you'll find out.One more thing, boy. FRANK and Buddy tense. What's this?Gonna be a drawing.You buy a ticket for $5.00 The day of the funeral we draw names. Then when I die, the winner gets my place, 300 acres of timber that hasn't been touched in 40 years. Mattie accidentally cuts a bloom off of a flower.Send it to the Quinn Funeral Home. Frank's eyes light up like fiery pinwheels and he almost yelps! Buddy looks oddly perplexed and sad.Mattie?Wasn't nowhere else to go.Well.I reckon so.You want to see it?You always know where you stand with a dog. Want to lay here with them someday if they'll have me.You leave things alone, they know what to do.No, Ma'am. I don't know what to do about anything much.Some people are more suited to it than others, I reckon.How you sleeping these days, girl?You sleep good?Chamomile, it's good when the nights get long. Helps you nod off. She takes it and smiles up at him.Want to go on a ways?Would you stay for supper?A supper guest every 30-40 years is not much trouble, Girl.Better stay close, some big old wild cats been eating my chickens.. She looks around and takes his arm..or maybe it was me.. She snorts and slaps his arm but doesn't let go..You still play the piano?I got a good feeling when you played. Remember that time you was playing and the lamp burned out? And you went right on in the dark? I hear that song sometimes at night. She shrugs shyly and sips the tea. Seconds tick by.What?Well. I heard you married.You have a tender heart, always did. She gives him a curious look.You can't wait for anything, Mattie. Close your eyes, hold your breath.. stay in one spot your whole life, but you're still moving, like the world's moving under you. There's no waiting.Reckon not, Little Bit.What do you think, boy? Buddy jerks, looks at Frank, at Bush.Can I trust you?Not what I asked.Hush.They goddamn.. He nods at the money and suddenly becomes the \"other\" Bush.Take out for the expenses you've already had and give me the receipts. As the bills come in for things, give them to me and I'll pay them. Put this money in a box and the boy and I'll take it someplace in the morning. Whatever new comes in, keep it in the bottom of one of them ugly caskets in there 'till I come get it. After the party, name a fair price for what you've done and we'll settle up.North.Till I say, son. Buddy gives him an uneasy look and pulls off down the tree- lined path.Don't say nothing.You can say \"hi\". Bush gets out. Buddy sighs, mimes \"Hi\" and gets out.Hey, Charlie. They shake hands, then hug. Buddy is blown away that Bush would hug anyone. Bush looks up at the church rafters.Still standing.That's Buddy Robinson, he don't talk much.Yes, sir.Well.Whatever you want to, Charlie.Sit still. Buddy plops back down.He can hear what's said. Buddy is surprised again. So is Charlie.I did.. what I thought was right.You self-righteous..I built my own jail and put myself in it! And I stayed in it for 40 goddamn years! No wife, no kids, no friends! That's not enough?Well. Why don't you come and say that then, Charlie? Hell, say it all! I don't care.Do you have to?There's a whole lot of things that you don't know. Like what a dog dreams. You can make up a story about him chasing rabbits but you don't know if there's rabbits in there or not. And he can't tell you, can he?People don't say what they mean either so you don't really know any more about them then you do about that dog's dream.Well, I... I ain't stayed with nobody in a.. in a long while.Let me out.Stop the car. Bush starts to open the door. Buddy stops abruptly.Put the money in a casket.Get the hell out of here, boy! Buddy's eyes are defiant. Bush slams the door and walks away, crossing over a fence and out into a dark field.They keep talking about forgiveness.. ask Jesus for forgiveness.. I never did nothing to Him..Please, Ma'am.Thank you.Can I sit a minute? She stares at him then nods at a chair. She keeps standing behind the other chair. He bends over the mug and seems to lock up inside.You want to know why I have your sister's picture on my wall?Can you help who you love? Mattie's face tells us that she has asked herself that question many times.I've had 40 years to think about it and I still don't know.I want to tell you how it was. If you don't want me to, I'll go. Mattie sighs from down deep in her shoes then comes around and sits down.I came to see you and she was there, hanging clothes on the line with your mama. Bush stares out the window so hard, Mattie turns to see what he is looking at..She turned around.. .and.. I promise you that I did not know that I had a heart till right then.You were a fine fine girl. I didn't know why you wanted anything to do with me but I was gonna keep coming to see you 'till my luck ran out.It's still going on, Little Bit. Mattie tries to absorb that. The truth and tragedy of it touches her in way that she is not prepared for. They sit there in silence. She suddenly wipes her face and scowls.Been there.They get it?Is he all right?You sure?They get the whiskey?Don't know.Don't know that I'm doing it.Thinking to call it off.Damn well can if I want to.If I say no, it's no. Send the money back.I care about this town as much as they care about me.Getting a suntan. Bush starts to get up then falls back against the ladder.You have no goddamn idea how right you are, son. Buddy moves to help him up but Bush waves him off.I'll sit here a minute. Bush looks at the butterfly bandage on Buddy's head.We're a pair, ain't we?Just going through the motions.There's Alive and there's Dead. And there's a worst place in between them that I hope you never know nothing about.Sonsabitches.You figure he took off with it?Well.. what do you want to do? Buddy looks back at Bush.Hell. Do it if you can.Why did you change your mind? Charlie just looks at him, the unspoken words louder than any reason he could give.Thank you.I don't. He gets a haunted look that catches Charlie off guard.I'm gonna try and tell it, Charlie, I really am. But if I can't get it done, would you do it? I want it said. Please, sir. Charlie sighs from down in his shoes and starts for the door.Tell'em the box is in the barn.You asked for it you old ornery sonofabitch, now what are you gonna do?Sonsabitches. Carl drops his can. The other men drop their cans but Gary starts to pull a pistol from his back pocket.Go on, I'll paint the porch with his head.Now pick up them cans and keep pouring.You heard me. The men cautiously pick up the cans..Pour it on your head. All of it. The men look at each other. Bush cocks the other barrel of his shotgun.Pour it or die, I don't care which. The men hoist the cans and start to pour the gasoline over them. Burning and spitting they empty the cans. Suddenly Theman bolts, moaning and running blind with gas in his eyes.I got two barrels, anybody else wants to rabbit, now's the time.A second chance is a precious thing, son. Don't waste it. The boy plops down, overwhelmed. And suddenly everyone is in motion. The Deputies run toward Bush. Frank and Charlie rush from the stage. Kathryn and Horton are going. Buddy arrives at Bush first and sees the blood weeping onto his shirt.Tried to burn me out. Let the boy be, he didn't mean nothing. As the Deputies get a hold of Carl and Gary, Frank, Charlie, Kathryn and Horton arrive. Carl looks at Horton with pleading eyes and nods to Tom.Close the door. Charlie slams the door. Frank examines the wound. Buddy stares in shock at the old roping burns scars on Bush's chest.Boil some water and I'll tell you how to make me a poultice. Frank takes the rags and alcohol from CharlieDon't sugar coat it.Let's go 'fore I lose my nerve.You ain't nervous? All them white folks out there?Stick with me, you'll be all right.Pretty interesting day so far, huh boy? Bush straightens himself up and goes out the door.Thank you, Charlie. Thank you. Charlie gives him a long look then steps away from the microphone and moves back to where Bush was standing. Bush stares at the microphone, takes a breath, and walks up to it, and looks out over the huge crowd.Had to go clear to Illinois to find somebody that had anything good to say about me. Hell of a thing. His voice booms out over the crowd, startling him. He looks down, sees Buddy, Kathryn, Frank and Horton. He looks closer for someone most important but she is not there. The crowd murmurs. Finally..I'm not a smart man or a wise one. I don't know what kind of man I am. I was always restless, thought I'd see the world. But I didn't hardly go nowhere.. on purpose..I fell in love with a married lady. And somehow she fell in love with me. It was the only time that I have been in love.Her husband answered the door.I hit him pretty hard, knocked him down. Can't remember going upstairs but I remember I saw a hammer on the steps and it had blood and hair on it. The crowd gasps. Mattie is trembling.I found her in the bedroom. She was crawling across the floor.And as I was slamming his head into the wall, trying to get shed of him, I could see clear as anything that it was all my fault. If I'd just never spoke to her..And then I realized that I was on fire. I tried to put myself out but I couldn't, everything was..I don't know how I got out the window.No matter how many times I play it in my mind, I can't remember jumping. I thought I killed him, but maybe he pushed me, I don't know... I swear to you, if I left her in there.. everything I know about myself is a lie. But that don't matter.Wonder if her hair would be white?Just fair, son.What's his name?He ain't gonna throw rocks at me, is he?You boys did good. Real good. Let's settle up.Bring my shirt back, I just got it broke in.Thanks again for coming, Charlie.Did you ever get my bill?", "clean_line": "hard life read need saving preacher yeah bush returns chopping

Hmm. Carl?Old man?Social event of the year and I missed it. Frank lowers the paper so just his eyes appear. He has no southern accent and doesn't look small town.Read the paper today? Something strange is happening in the world right now.People are dying in bunches. Everywhere. But here. He puts the paper down and studies his socks.I wonder what the odds are of a funeral home going broke? I mean you have a business everybody on earth needs, you can't make that work, it's got to be you right? And yet.. I don't know.. what do you do when people won't die?Onethingabout Chicago, people knowhowto die; they drown, get runover,shot, whatever it takes.It's them or us. Frank sighs and stares forlornly out at a casket.How much did he have?Ooo, hermit money. That's good. Buddy sees Bush's signs.You've been wanting a shot at sales..As of right now, you're on commission. Remember; foot in the door, establish trust, and drop the hammer. Buddy hesitates, crawls out, and eyes the shack.No doubt but if you don't do this by yourself, you won't know if you're any good. And you'll never be any good if you don't know you are. Go get him!Oh yes Ma'am, I do respect your wishes but you see...state law requires.. No ma'am, we can't bury him under the house.. There is a loud KNOCK at the door. Buddy goes to get it.Well just for argument's sake, Ma'am, how would we get the casket under the house? No casket?But you have to have a container of some kind, Ma'am for decency and uh, sanitation. Bush enters the Funeral Home. As Buddy starts to close the door, Bush catches it.Yes, Ma'am, but there's lots of natural things that aren't decent. He did what?! Good God. No, Ma'am, I didn't know that about your husband. Well, yeah now I understand why you want him under the house but still.. The phone goes dead. FRANK sighs as Bush walks in.Come in, come in, pleasure. Coffee? As Bush shakes Frank's hand, he stares into him, taking everything in, his bloodshot eyes, the wrinkled shirt beneath his suit, his breath. Frank feels downright naked.A little bit of everywhere, I guess. Get him a chair, Buddy! Buddy stands behind the waiting chair.How can we help you, sir? Bush gives Buddy a look, then looks back at Frank who steadfastly refuses to look at the ball of money.Boy, are you in luck.Solid pecan, steel handles.. Bush eyes it, repulsed.Whatever you want, flowers..Burial plot..A service?A what?We can do that.You will be, I guarantee it.Hold on now, it's a detail, we can look at it.So you'd like to have a funeral party while you're alive so you can go?Yes. Buddy is lost.Buddy, get some paper. We need to make of list of who Mr. Bush wants to invite.. As Buddy starts to get up.Say again.Well, sir, the thing is, how would you get people to come and tell stories about you that I'm guessing might get them, you know.. shot? Bush scoops up the ball of money and heads out. Now all Frank can see is the money, leaving.You know what, you go ahead, don't worry about it, we'll think of something. A couple of ideas just came to me.How would she know him?So? We got to know. Kathryn shakes her head and goes back outside. FRANK has another look at Mattie then lets the curtain fall back.See the size of that thing?What do you mean, what? Goddamn ball of money! He wants a party with pink balloons on his ears, we're gonna give it to him.I sold 26 of the ugliest cars ever made one December, in Chicago, with wind blowing so hard up my ass I was farting snow flakes in July so don't tell me we can't do this.That's the last \"but\" I want to hear out of you. You're a salesman now, sell!She called him Felix.We have a plan. All we need is a little bit of your time.Didn't buy it for them.Where's he going?Mr. Bush, you can get all the hairs cut you want after we take your picture, I'll pay for it. Mr. Tollerude doesn't know whether to cut or not.Yes.Why?And you want as many people to come as possible so..Basically. Don't you think?Take it. I'd go see that.Son of a bitch, it's almost worth it.Well, normally people don't wear shoes in a casket so.. .what are you, about a 10D?Pretty optimistic taking a change of clothes to the grave. How you set for underwear?One question too many.I don't mean to be nosey but uh.. how do you know Mattie?If He is, the Divine's cheating.Don't agree with me Ray, it makes me doubt myself.You made my point and don't even know it.God, I love small towns.\"Felix\" Bush.A funeral party.Hey, the man wants to be at his own funeral. What can I say? I'd like to be at my funeral so I could tell my ex-wife to kiss my..Because, Dear, vultures are constitutionally unable to ignore the dead. Mattie grins which delights Frank, no end. Horton stops counting his money and stares at Frank.They might. He's inviting everyone who has a story about him to come. You could tell about him kicking your ass, Carl. Carl looks at Frank as if he wants to cold cock him.Wouldn't you like to know what everybody says about you behind your back, Ray? Yeah, probably not.Let's play some cards.It's who has it last that counts.I got an idea. Let's try something different.You really think you're that good that nobody sees?You cheat at everything you do. Even at the bank, you loan people just enough to get'em deeper in so you can foreclose on them.Am I? Then stand up and roll down your socks. Stand up or I'll stand you up. Ray looks around the table and suddenly realizes that he is irreversibly exposed and alone. The sound of Frank's chair scraping the floor makes him jerk up.I'll walk you home.I'm sorry about the..we don't always fight, okay, we do, but he's had that coming for..You came because you don't know what to do with yourself. I slept on the same side of the bed my whole life, right? But after my wife left me, I switched sides, just like that, and never been able to go back.Hey, it's his idea! They look at Bush who has taken off the headset and looking at it like he wants to take it home.It's what you want, right?Jesus, kid!Well yeah, no, but some of it's gonna be! We're putting this thing on! Frank rips open two more envelopes and dollar bills rain down to the floor. He's beside himself. Buddy eyes him warily.I don't know exactly how much your land's worth but looks to me like you could get maybe 10 times that or more. I don't know what to do with it. I mean it's yours to do with what you want but I'm getting a little nervous about it. Never thought I'd see enough money to make me nervous. We should probably talk about the price for everything, the clothes, the ads, the food and drink for the party, the music.. our fee for everything, we'll be fair about that, I'm not worried about it. Bush is looking at Buddy who is looking across the room.No! Ray is not.. I mean, if it was my money I'd put it in a bank out of town so everyone didn't know my business. This bank here, you can't trust, that's all I'm saying.Every name, every dollar, is right there!I've done a hell of a job for you. I don't see why..I've sold horses, cars, houses, hell, pocket watches pinned to the inside of my coat. I'm not ashamed of it. I don't rob banks, don't cheat at cards, and I sleep all right the nights I sleep. What was the question..?Is it just me or is he extremely fucking articulate when he wants to be?It's not clear, is it?Hold on. I told you that you were working on commission..So whatever our end of this is, you get a piece.Half. It could help set you up, Buddy. So whatever feels wrong is gonna feel right pretty damn quick,okay? We just have to close it out. From here on, watch me, do what I do, and we'll be fine.He wants you to go with him to take this money somewhere which means that it's you he trusts. And that's fine because I trust you too. Just don't trust him, okay?Look, that funny feeling you have.. I have it too. And it's not funny. So go along, be friendly, but that's it.But the critical time is just before it closes. It's like a witching hour and everything tries to come apart. We're not going to let that happen.Now go. You know.. I always wondered why you wanted to work here. I thought you could do a lot better. I didn't know about your folks, I'm really sorry.Hey Mattie. He looks almost boyish and bashful as he drinks her in.Was that you? It was really..Yeah, sorry. He stands, loving the view, forgetting why he is here. She waits it out as long as she can, not sure how she feels about this adoring look.Uh, yeah.. Help!I'm up to my ears with this funeral and I thought, you know, we haven't had time to talk much lately so maybe you'd like to come over and rip open envelopes with me andOh, okay, I just..The cut's not bad but how's the head? He moves his finger across Buddy's eyes.Follow it. He looks him over carefully. He's had experience.Dizzy? Double vision? Nauseous? You'll be okay. Did you see who it was?You did good.What the hell?! Bush glances at the pistol, at the open drawers of the cabinet and desk.No. Buddy sealed it up in a casket. Took a crack on the head, but..Yeah.I was an army medic. He'll be fine. But Bush is still dark.But you ought to take those clothes back and get something in your size.Brought the money back, huh? Listen, I've been thinking.. What if we had the party at your place? People are going to want to see the land they're getting so..Well, think about it, we could..What?!You can't!No no no, it's in motion!You're killing me! I bought things, hired people.. promised money, everybody in town is hoping to..It's what you said you wanted and I've busted my ass for you. So why don't you want it anymore? You owe me that.Buddy! You up?! Frank rushes in, lifts a phantom hat to Kathryn, scrapes up a chair, pulls on the baby's toe, and looks at Buddy.Trouble.Bush is pulling out.What happened yesterday?But what happened?Son of a bitch, that's got to be..Why not?What is it?Well if Bush wants him, by God, Bush is gonna get him.What? What's wrong?It's not like that, Katie, this is for all of us. You're like.. family to me.. I..Well, I'm sorry. I've never had any practice. You okay? Buddy nods. Frank leaves. Buddy mutters to the baby..Reverend Jackson? Frank Quinn, Quinn funeral home.Bush? No, sir.Pretty sure.You told Bush that you wouldn't come to the funeral?To help you rethink it.Have you rethought it? So there is a need.He came to see me after he'd been here, wants to call the party off.Said he'd meant it to be a.. end of the line, tell it all, get out of jail funeral but that he didn't have the guts to open his mouth and he couldn't get anybody to talk for him. You know anything about that part? At first he said he wanted everybody to come who had a story about him. But he didn't want to hear their bullshit stories, did he? Pardon my language. He wants to tell one, doesn't he?Or can't.Or can't.Is there a boarding house around here?Yeah but if you're not coming, I'm not going back. I made promises I can't keep to people I care about. This falls apart they won't blame Bush. Bank will take my business.. If I'm gonna have to start over again, might as well be from here. Charlie scowls at him.Yeah.I forgot.In the hearse, under the floorboards. Charlie remembers that Frank said he wasn't coming back and gives him a look. Buddy is giving Frank the same look.What? Nobody steals a hearse. Now all we got to do is take the Reverend here to Bush and..You're shittin' me?! Charlie gets up and starts walking away..You can't leave you just got here.Hold on..Honestly? We don't have a clue about what's going to happen here.Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I'm Frank Quinn of Quinn Funeral Home. Welcome to the live funeral party of Mr. Felix Bush! People don't know whether to clap or not. Some do and the rest of them pick it up. Buddy gets to Kathryn and hugs her and the baby.I've done some things in my life, but never this. Bet you haven't either, bet no one has.We try to make things predictable and safe but if we don't risk everything to get what we want, we don't want it enough.The person who made all of this happen for us doesn't like the spotlight but Buddy Robinson is the heart of Quinn Funeral Home and I'm proud to know him. Buddy is embarrassed and moved. Kathryn's eyes soften.I know many of you have heard stories about Mr. Bush. But today I've been told that we're going to hear another kind of story, his. A murmuring moves in a wave across the crowd as they see.. .Bush enters the field with his shotgun pointed at Carl and Gary's backs. They are drenched with gas and it is burning them through their clothes. Buddy, Kathryn, and Horton see Bush. Quinn and Charlie follow the crowd's eyes to Bush.Missed the bone. Got any alcohol and clean rags? Bush nods at the cabinet. Charlie finds an amazing assortment of herbs and roots, alcohol and old sheets ripped into rags.This is gonna hurt.Can't stop pulling Aces out of his ass, can he?Yeah. We'll come out tomorrow.Are you alright, Mattie? She looks up at Frank for a long moment, her face softening.What?!", "clean_line": "let guess hmm carl old man social event year missed frank lowers paper eyes appear southern accent look small town
