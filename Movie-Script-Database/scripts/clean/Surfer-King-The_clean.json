Drag me kicking and screaming from my happy home in California to some weird place in Colorado, and say hey, this'll be fun Robbie. Maybe we can go camping....\"Administrative Assistant.\" There's no such thing as a secretary anymore.Grounds crew. What kind of job is that? It sound like the guy who cleans out the coffee pots.I had friends in Oceanside. I had something to do for the summer.All thanks to Dad and his secretary.Whatever. Some summer....I will. I promise. See you laterI'm Robbie. Robbie Zirpollo.I believe it's with the Grounds Crew?I can swim. Why?Almost 16. I get my license in September.Well, I just moved here. I guess I missed guard tryouts. You're a guard then?Can't swim, huh?What is that?Ouch.Whoa....who was that?So who is she?Cowboy, huh. Big guy?Rob Zirpollo. Uh, Robert ZirpolloSo what is this grounds thing, anyway?I was confused myself, sir. I had heard I was working for some Hawaiian guy.So that was a typical lunch crowd?Busier?There's nothing like cash money in your pocket. What's that over there?I can't imagine it's that difficult. ...no rudder on the board...No?You were right. I was interested inOK.Hey. I've been sent to find some table stretchers and left-handed coffee pots.Yeah, how'd you know?Thanks.Got it.Wow. Jamaica. I thought I was far from home.Hi. We're looking for some table stretchers and left-handed coffee pots.Uh, yes...Robbie. Ummm, Rob Zirpollo.Thanks.What did that girl Amy mean?When she said, when are you going to tell him?Aokee's not going to be happy. Nobody seems to know where these things are...What?What a dirty trick.Humph.But...don't we get an employee discount? Shouldn't we go in the front?What now?What is this thing for anyway?And what would this concessions kid have to do?Has it ever happened?Hello. On break?Coming up.These are only for VIP guests.California. I just moved here at the beginning of the summer.You'd love the ocean. And the sunsets are incredible. You can almost hear the sizzle as the sun drops into the ocean... Of course, we all know it doesn't drop into the ocean.Let's just say I missed my chance, and Alex saved me from a death worse than fate. I was very nearly a trash rat.Mmmm. I told her how beautiful the California sunsets are.Yeah. The Wave?Ah ha! Let's go.I'm from Oceanside, California. I was born on a surfboard.In my sleep.What did I spill now?I dunno. Yeah, surfing is usually how I spend my summers.Yeah. Some kind of trophy.I dunno...seems kind of silly to me.It shouldn't be that hard...how good could this Cowboy be?Hello, Grandma? No, I'm fine. Listen, Grandma...I need you to send me a few of my things...I don't how much fun it will be. With Aokee hosting, we'll be working.I'm afraid you're right. Something mustPerfect. A work of art.They're..Oh, he's great. Alex too. I thought this summer was going to be a train wreck, but it's not turning out too bad.No, but it looks like I will get a chance to do some surfing anyway.Apparently there's some kind of surfing contest and Aokee is all over me to enter.You've heard of it?We'll see. It seems kind of stupid to me. A surfing contest in Colorado.Hey, listen. Alex told me about this great spot on the other side of Thunder Bay that looks down on the party, but it's a little more quiet. Want to go for a walk?Not both my folks. Just my Mom.Let's just say my father had an eye for his administrative assistant, and now they're both somewhere in Mexico. Mom got a job here, some of her family's here, so they said \"Colorady is the place you outta be\".Well, I must admit, I've met some very nice people. In California, the attitude's a little different. Here, not everyone is out to prove something. Seem's like everyone just wants to have fun.Just a sec.Hey, Alex. Give us break down here. Turn down the sound effects.So where did you learn to dance like this?Can you keep my deepest, darkest secret?When you grow up within spitting distance of Hollywood, every mother seems to think her child is the next Harrison Ford. So when I was about 12, my Mom started taking me to all these auditions for things.Some days I'm not even the next Robbie Zirpollo.Turns out I get this part. They're selling some dish soap or something, and they think it will be magical to have two twelve year old kids dancing ballroom on this fantasy set with clouds and everything. They lock this girl and I into a dance studio with a choreographer for two weeks, and then they shoot the commercial.Yeah, but when it came out everyone in school saw it. I couldn't go anywhere for six months without everyone in the room laughing their heads off.Hello?Hello?Yeah, sorry. Are you Pipeman?So you're real name's Carl?Oh. Well, my name's Robbie. I work at Aokee's.I need your help.It's not the scrub sink. I need your help. I'm competing in the Employee Olympics. With your advanced surfing experience, Aokee thought you might be able to help me.Well, you know. \"Pipeman\"? Hawaii's North Shore? Surfing the pipeline?Oh, boy. See, I'm from California, and I can surf, I just don't know what to expect from the wave on Thunder Bay. I...I was just hoping you could help, I really am sorry for bothering you.I need a mentor; you know like in Karate Kid.No, no it's a movie.Generally, you, as mentor, draw on some personal religious philosophy to first intimidate, and then later inspire me. What religion are you?Ah, Brigham Young and all that.Okay...and your belief structure....Great, perfect. Thanks. I won't let you down. What the heck is a corn-nut?Hi! Glad you could make it. What's that?With that? A garage door clicker?Should be about right. Aren't you getting in? Where's your board?Just gimme another wave.Okay. Please. Tell me what I did wrong.The ocean never had a back wall. Thank you.Sorry, dude, that tray was way off balance.I'm really getting the hang of that wave.I'll try to remember to look and see who's watching.How will the judging work?You've seen the competition. What does everybody do?OK. I'm ready.Hey Jaffa. NO worries. People are betting on me?I've seen this Cowboy practice. His style is more longboard, and this is a shortboard wave, but he's still pretty good. I could lose you know.How ya doin' See. How come everyone knows me by sight now?I suppose. I've been working out a strategy to use if Cowboy has a real good day. It's risky...You know me?The best teriyaki east of the Pacific.Well, sure. I'll be working all afternoon.Yes. Yes we do.Alex! I won't need a ride tonight after all. Tiff's taking me home!Hard to blame them. No one told them they had to put their mouth on yours until the last minute. Yuck.Oh. Hey.Uh. OK, I guess. Kind of a tie.Party, huh? That sounds like fun. I have to work until nine tonight.K...Hey. I'm done with the pots and pans. It's almost nine. Can I take off now?Everything OK?Well, Tiffany invited me to a little party up in the mountains.It's no big deal. I'll be fine.But...Aw, come on...Maybe she's just letting him down easy.Like what?Naw. You guys are nuts. She's not like that.Look, I know what to believe and what not to. I'm not that easily fooled.Sure. He's great. I love working here. Aokee, you've been real good to me...Aokee?And you knew?I need to think about all this.Right. Goodnight.What you lookin' at?I slept fine. I decided I'm not my father. I don't run out on the people I care about just because some blond shakes her ta-ta's at me.Get going!Second.Don't want to win with him falling.Actually, that's exactly what I'm thinking. It's the reason we're in a tie. I've been too conservative. I've got to do everything I can, or just forget about it. It's all or nothing. We gotta pull the fin.One time, these tourists from Japan on the beach at La Jolla offered me a hundred bucks to do a full spin at the top of the wave, and then slide down and cut back and do a full back flip. I pulled it off. A friend of mine had a tricks board with just a single fin and foot pockets.You got duct tape?Here and here.Pipeman is taking the extra fins off my board. I only need one to make a deep cut back. He is also putting some pockets to slip my feet into so when I flip upside down, I don't lose the board.A back flip. You guys see it on snowboarders here all the time, I'm sure.Yeah, well, a tie is like kissing your sister.I'll need the biggest wave you can give me...I'm just making this up as I go along.I just want to thank Aokee, Alex and Katie for all their support.And I have just one thing to say to everyone in concessions. WE DID IT!I don't know...we have a pretty good time at AOKEE's.You wouldn't like it...You know Katie, I really am sorry I was such a jerk this summer.Alex?I'm gonna need to borrow twenty bucks.", "clean_line": "yeah great love plan drag kicking screaming happy home california weird place colorado hey ll fun robbie maybe camping administrative assistant thing secretary anymore grounds crew kind job sound like guy cleans coffee pots friends oceanside summer thanks dad secretary summer promise lateri robbie robbie zirpollo believe grounds crew swim license september moved guess missed guard tryouts guard swim huh ouch whoa cowboy huh big guy rob zirpollo uh robert zirpolloso grounds thing confused sir heard working hawaiian guy typical lunch crowd busier like cash money pocket imagine difficult rudder board right interested inok hey ve sent table stretchers left handed coffee pots yeah know thanks got wow jamaica thought far home hi looking table stretchers left handed coffee pots uh yes robbie ummm rob zirpollo thanks girl amy mean said going tell aokee going happy know things dirty trick humph employee discount shouldn thing concessions kid happened hello break coming vip guests california moved beginning summer love ocean sunsets incredible hear sizzle sun drops ocean course know drop ocean let missed chance alex saved death worse fate nearly trash rat mmmm told beautiful california sunsets yeah wave ah ha let oceanside california born surfboard sleep spill dunno yeah surfing usually spend summers yeah kind trophy dunno kind silly shouldn hard good cowboy hello grandma fine listen grandma need send things fun aokee hosting ll working afraid right mustperfect work art oh great alex thought summer going train wreck turning bad looks like chance surfing apparently kind surfing contest aokee enter ve heard ll kind stupid surfing contest colorado hey listen alex told great spot thunder bay looks party little quiet want walk folks mom let father eye administrative assistant mexico mom got job family said colorady place outta admit ve met nice people california attitude little different prove like wants fun sec hey alex break turn sound effects learn dance like deepest darkest secret grow spitting distance hollywood mother think child harrison ford mom started taking auditions things days robbie zirpollo turns selling dish soap think magical year old kids dancing ballroom fantasy set clouds lock girl dance studio choreographer weeks shoot commercial yeah came school saw couldn months room laughing heads hello hello yeah sorry pipeman real carl oh robbie work aokee need help scrub sink need help competing employee olympics advanced surfing experience aokee thought able help know pipeman hawaii north shore surfing pipeline oh boy california surf know expect wave thunder bay hoping help sorry bothering need mentor know like karate kid movie generally mentor draw personal religious philosophy intimidate later inspire religion ah brigham young okay belief structure great perfect thanks won let heck corn nut hi glad garage door clicker right aren getting board gimme wave okay tell wrong ocean wall thank sorry dude tray way balance getting hang wave ll try remember look watching judging work ve seen competition everybody ok ready hey jaffa worries people betting ve seen cowboy practice style longboard shortboard wave pretty good lose know ya doin come knows sight suppose ve working strategy use cowboy real good day risky know best teriyaki east pacific sure ll working afternoon yes yes alex won need ride tonight tiff taking home hard blame told mouth minute yuck oh hey uh ok guess kind tie party huh sounds like fun work tonight hey pots pans ok tiffany invited little party mountains big deal ll fine aw come maybe letting easy like naw guys nuts like look know believe easily fooled sure great love working aokee ve real good aokee knew need think right goodnight lookin slept fine decided father run people care blond shakes ta ta going second want win falling actually exactly thinking reason tie ve conservative ve got forget gotta pull fin time tourists japan beach la jolla offered bucks spin wave slide cut flip pulled friend tricks board single fin foot pockets got duct tape pipeman taking extra fins board need deep cut putting pockets slip feet flip upside lose board flip guys snowboarders time sure yeah tie like kissing sister ll need biggest wave making want thank aokee alex katie support thing concessions know pretty good time aokee wouldn like know katie sorry jerk summer alex gonna need borrow bucks"}, "ALEX": {"raw_line": "...and so SHE says I'll have the filet AND the lobster\".

Where you workin'?What's the matter, can't swim?Well, you look old enough to be a guard.It's just that most of the guys on grounds are a little younger than you. Most guys your age that can swim are guards.Oh, no no no. I work concessions...at Aokee's Surf and Snack Shack. It's just as well. The guards are mostly stuck up anyway. The rest of us are the ones who know how to have fun.Nope.Surf tunes, dude!Ahh. And here we have the fair Melissa, time clerk extraordinaire...Dear Melissa. There's nothing about our relationship that couldn't be fixed by us spending a few moments together in the pumphouse behind Thunder Bay.My dear, you cut me to the quick. Check off my name and that of my amigo here, Mr. Robbie Zirpollo.She wants me. Yeeees?Eeeaasy there, big fella. Not in your lifetime. Or mine.Miss Tiffany Maxwell, daughter of Big Mike Maxwell, owner and operator of this here fine water park.See, Princess Tiffany and her friends pretty much have the run of the park. Her boyfriend is Dan Peterson, a guy we all call Cowboy, one of the lifeguards. Pretty decent guy from what I can tell. But she's a piece of work. Your best strategy is to steer clear of her and she won't cause you any trouble.Big. Guy.Let's just say....you are critical and indispensable to the ongoing operation... and....flow of things here at the park.I'll show him. I'm going in thatLeft. Left. Left right left.Who....?You know...I just met a guy that's oldSeemed like our kind of people.OK.Hello, Colonel!Yes sir, Colonel. And what a fine staff you've assembled this year. Have you told them yet about your army background?Wasn't much? Can you just imagine for a moment the germs and bacteria our American soldiers could pick up in an unsanitised army latrine? It's impossible to determine just how many lives have been saved thanks to the efforts of this one humble Army Colonel.I, too, came up through the ranks when at age 14, I began my service here at Water World learning from this great man.Not even sure I remember it myself, sir. But I remember much more. Did you tell them about the film?\"Hygiene Makes You Happy\" Every enlisted man in the army has seen it. Some by choice. All from the mind of The Colonel here...Bureaucratic bumble...Lost paperwork....An error in the front office...Spiced applesauce....It's Robbie sir. He was supposed to work at Aokee's and through some crazy mix-up, he ended up here.Never happened before....Spaghetti marinara...Hey, hey lookin' good. Blue is your color. Beats that stupid t-shirt, huh?Sorry, Sarah, but I need to borrow this.Oh, Puh-leeaase.Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?In exactly 30 minutes, hundreds of dripping wet customers with fistfuls of money smelling of chlorine and suntan lotion will be walking in here. And what will they be looking for?Annnnnnd?Now, everyone's a little tense, except me, of course. So to help you get in the proper frame of mind and relax, we needThis is little tune I like to call the Paradise Slide. One, two, a one two three.Right. See you in a little while.Well, it's early in the season yet. We'll get busier.Don't worry. You'll get used to it. And tips were good, right?Oh, you'll find this ride interesting.It's a lot harder than it looks.Now this is a place of many wonders. See those guys in line over there?We call them \"Wave Bums\". They all have season passes, and do little more than ride the wave all day long. Some of them get pretty good.That's where they hang out when they're not riding the wave. Don't get too close to them.Contact high.And there, my friend, is another one of The Wave's features.We call them \"Wave Babes\". And there's a special secret to this ride.Hey, Bob....can I borrow your radio a minute?Hey Frank, it's Alex.Listen you have a possible code 4. Means a \"hottie\".She's up next. A free chicken sandwich and a smoothie if you bounce up the pressure a bit.He knows my weak spot. Two Volcanos and a chicken sandwich.Watch, and wait....Yesss!Well, sometime bring your swimsuit. We'll come back on break. I'll show you how to do it. Surf's is this way. And keep an eye out for Frank over there. We owe him.The First Aid station is over there. Just ask the guard. I just want to say hello to this girl I know.Jama...I mean...Jaffa the Jamaican...what shakes, it mon?Jaffa, meet Robbie Zirpollo. Jaffa plays the tunes and talks the talk.He's calling for security.Hey Eddie. What have you got?You got this?Hi, Amy. Who's this?About what?I'll tell you over a hamburger at Big Mike's.Yep.There's no such thing as a table stretcher or a left-handed coffee pot.It's just Aokee's way of giving you a tour of the park without having to be there. Consider it a rookie initiation.Time to make it up to you. Come on.Hey Davey...how 'bout two for two?Chocolate.Now, if he ever shows up at our back door, we owe him chicken and smoothies.Well...the discount is larger this way.Come on...let's go eat!Oh boy. Here we go.Aokee. The pigeons have been taking target practice on his trophy pedestal. Come on.Happens every week.That stand is to display the coveted Surfer King trophy. Aokee seems to think that one day some concessions kid with more courage than brains is going to beat the lifeguards in the annual Employee Olympics.Nothing, really. Just out surf the strongest guard of them all in the surfing competition. No big deal.A guard always wins the surf competition. Know why?Amy. Have you ever seen the fabulous Cummings and Robbins 2000-B?It's incredible. It washes 2000 plates an hour....Well...how'd you do?Good job. You work fast. Hey it's time for our break. Bring your swimsuit?The Wave. I love that water.Can't swim. It's only three inches deep.Now, just take it easy, and don't expect too much at first. When you wipe out, your ride is done.Just ease into it.Gees. Where did you learn to do that?Think you could ride that?I took Robbie to The Wave today.No. It turns out that he's from Oceanside. California. You know, where they always hold those surf competitions?It turns out that he placed second in the state high school finals for the shortboard competition. As a Sophomore.I saw it myself. You wouldn't believe it.Our Robbie.That's what I was thinking.You heard it. He's in the kitchen...It's a big deal. Every girl wants to date you. Every guy wants to BE you. Special privileges...we all wear standard uniforms. The Surfer King gets to be creative. You ever see the cowboy hat Cowboy wears?He's a myth.Pipeman. The Banzai Pipeline. I get it. Some kind of legendary surf champ. Where do we find him?This will be good. Aokee throws a great Luau.There'll still be time for fun. Most of the work is setting up. Besides, we get paid, too. When was the last time you got paid to party?These never fail.Now this will never do.Oh, yes, yes......special smoothies. Fortunately, you know people on the inside.You girls want to dance?Oh, Dougie. You know, I left my wallet over in my locker. I'll see you before we leave and get it to you then.You know, you could always come by Aokee's and I could give it to you in trade.No problem.All these switches feed sound throughout the park. Which reminds me.And this is for bad little girls who don't know how to have fun.Oops. There....almost got you.Uh oh. Sorry. Hold that thought.I'm on it.Just a little friendly pool. No big deal. Helps make this more interesting. Concessions never had a chance before...Ah, you're the next big thing. You'll survive it. The Employee Olympics are only a week away. What happens is we have this big opening ceremony where each team chooses a theme and we're judged on our spirit. Then different teams compete in contests that test their Water World skills. The next morning it all ends with the surf contest. You ready?I'm Alex!Come on, we gotta get back.Big something. I hope he knows how to work without a net.I guess we'll both find out on Sunday. I sure hope so.Tiff?I can't believe those guys screwed up the CPR.Bunch of babies.I'm telling you we need to talk him. Something's going on.So how about this? He tells me I've got to cover for him if his mother calls. He told her he's spending the night at my house.Yes. Tiffany's got something up her sleeve and Robbie's too messed up toRobbie. She's still going out with Cowboy. I saw them together at the movies two nights ago.Robbie...things...things are not always what they seem to be.She is like that.Aokee?OK. Take Aokee for instance. Gentle, genial Hawaiian guy, right?Then let me introduce you properly. Robbie Zirpollo, meet Manuel Ramirez.Manuel's family snuck across the border ten years ago through Juarez, Mexico.And I said, boy, you speak Spanish like a native....uh oh. It's been our little secret. Now it's your secret, too.You do.Not yet.She shook her ta-tas? No one said anything about shaking ta-tas. This puts a whole new light on things!Don't be silly. That only works in the movies.Flip upside down?Oh yeah, I'm sure I did that last winter. But not on purpose! Dude. You're either gonna win this thing or you're gonna die.You stay away from my sister.Looks like he's waiting for you to make a mistake. You sure you know what you're doing?Works for me!
