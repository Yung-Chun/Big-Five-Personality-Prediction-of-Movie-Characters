{"Deadpool": {"DEADPOOL": {"raw_line": "Kinda lonesome back here.Little help?Pool. Deadpool.It's like Christmas Day, Dopinder. Been waiting one thousand eight hundred twenty- two days, three hours... ...and thirty-six minutes for this shit.Nice.Not the Daffodil Daydream. The girl.Dopinder, I'm starting to think I'm in this cab for a reason.No, my slender brown friend... to give you one crucial piece of advice: Love... is a beautiful thing. When it finds you, the whole world smells like Daffodil Daydream.So hold onto love tight. Go at Bandhu hard. Get Gita back. Or else... the whole world will taste like Mama June after hot yoga.Like two hobos making love under a drizzle of Limburger- I could go all day like this. Point is, bad.Shiiiit. My extra mags! I usually leave them right by the door so I'll trip over them! Someone must've moved them...No time. Not today. Ten, eleven, twelve... or bust. Right here!Oooo. I never carry a wallet when I'm working. Ruins the lines of my suit. How 'bout a crisp high five?I owe you one. Merry Christmas, Dopinder.Can I get some fries with that shake- shake boobie? If looks could kill you would be an uzi.Oh, hello, Deadpool here. You may be wondering whose balls I had to fondle to get my own movie. Rhymes with `Polverine.' Couple'a smooth criminals. In a word, gorgeous. Surprisingly little hair down there. It's a jungle down there. Thick underbrush. Anyway, I smell Oscar. The suit's gonna match the carpet. Now... places to be... faces to fix... bad guys to kill...On your mark, get set, go, let me go, let me shoop...\u00a1Hola! \u00a1Me llamo Piscina De La Muerte! Hello! My name is the Pool of Death. There's no easy way to say this. I'm pregnant, Trevor. Any of you seen Green Lantern? Me neither.Rich... Corinthian... Leather.Scuse, por favor!Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.Loved your work in Daredevil.Shit. Did I leave the stove on?Wait, wait...Wait! You're probably wondering. Why the red suit? It's so bad guys can't see me bleed. This guy has the idea. He wore the brown pants. All together now...Twelve..!Eleven...Ten...Nine. Shit! Eight. Fuck! Seven. Shit- fuck!Six.Someone's not counting. Cinco.Me gusta cinco.Four. Three. Stupid. Worth it.Number two...What the shit-biscuit! Where you at, Francis?One.I'm touching myself tonight.Really? Rolling up the sleeves?I know what you're thinking...I'll bet he works out. So what if I am pulling the double shift at the ab- factory? What if I do want my man menu to feature the shredded beef? Call it insecurity. But I haven't touched a carb since...Here's the thing. Life is an endless series of train-wrecks with only brief, commercial-like breaks of happiness. This had been the ultimate commercial break. Which meant it was time to return......to our regularly scheduled program.See, people do react differently. Vanessa's already working on Plan A. B. All the way to Z. Me? I'm memorizing the details of her face. Like it's the first time I'm seeing it. Or the last.Believe it or not, this is only the ninth shittiest thing that's ever happened to me.Stick around. Number 6 is coming right up.You know how many people I've killed to find you?So you're aware I've been waiting a long, long time for this. And now I'm finally gonna... So you're aware of the category 5 fuck- storm that's coming. Then you know what's coming. I'm about to do to you what Sugar Ray did to the mid-nineties.Dad?Thank you, Agent Smith.Some kind of anger can't be managed. Like the kind where your year-long plan ends with the wrong guy getting dismembered! That said... when it comes time to licking wounds... there's no place like home, and I share that home with someone you met, the old blind lady from the laundromat, Al. She's like Robin to my Batman. Except she's old. And black. And blind.And I think she loves me. Wait... pretty sure Robin loves Batman, too.Then, just when I thought I could breathe easy...If you think I'm losing my marbles `cause I can't breathe. You're only half right.See, if Francis was able to see his reflection...You know what they say. You always remember your first time.Even 5 years later... Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15There... all caught up.Thanks for the lift! Apologies if I bled in the recyclables.Let's get ready to Rooooooomba!Morning, roomie! This place reeks like old lady pants.But you're no lady.So comfy.You mean my big rubber masturbatin' shoes?One-thousand eight-hundred twenty-two ornaments pinned to two-hundred-sixty calendars. All for a `Christmas' that... never... came!Sit on a stick.Yeah. Bactine should do it. How's the Kullen coming? IKEA doesn't assemble itself.Anything's an improvement on the Hurdal. I'd have taken a Hemnes... or even a Trysil... over the Hurdal. But I didn't get excited `til I saw the Kullen.Here? Now? Just kidding. I know it's been decades for you.And totally grossed out!And I quote: `Looking for roommate. Blind to life's imperfections. Must be good with hands.' Or wouldya rather I build IKEA and you pay rent?Let's recap. That cock-thistle who turned me into this freak... the one I've been waiting five years for... slipped through my arms today. Arm.Catching him was my only chance to be hot again. Get my super-sexy ex back. And stop the same shit from happening to anyone else. So yeah, things are pretty fucking scrumptious.Hash-tag Drive-by.Once I've got the cure, I'm gonna do the same to Francis...Sorry, Francis. But my lips are sealed.I didn't just get the cure to El C\u00e1ncer. I got the cure to everything.In the whole wide world, there's nothing as ugly... ...as fear.Don't make me ask twice. Where's Francis?!I said, where's... fucking... FR- You made me ask twice.Fuck. Me.Don't make me ask twice. Where's-Donde esta Francisco?And I don't have time for you to learn.Take me to your leader. I've always wanted to say that.Squeal. Like a pig. Where's Francis?In no particular order. Where's your boss? And where can I find good Indian food?That's so bad guys can't- never mind, they've already heard that.You're about to tell me everything you know about Francis Freeman. Known aliases. Current whereabouts. Boxers or briefs. Go.Open your mouth. Here comes the airplane!Don't make me break out the Collective Soul CDs.You give me your boss. I give you the rest of your life.I don't feel good about myself. But where is he? I'm so sorry.Agent Smith!I know, right?! I look like a million bucks.Come out, come out, wherever you are! Don't make me ask tw- Good for you!Don't recognize the voice? Maybe the resum\u00e9: Forty-one confirmed kills. Make that Eighty-nine. Seven the past week alone. Same rate most folks... ...get a shave.Ding-ding-ding! Now... you're about to tell me where I can find your boss. Or I'm gonna make you feel worse. Wait......worse than worse.Santa Claus is coming......to town!Late-late-late-late-late!Hurry-hurry-hurry-hurry-hurry!Taxi!And we all know how this turned out. Cue Benny Hill speed...There. All caught up.You can stick that where you stuck the Bactine! I found my stash of wisdom- tooth Percocet in the Storjorm, and I'm orbiting Saturn. But I appreciate the gesture.The size of a KFC spork.What do I keep saying, Mrs. Magoo? She wouldn't have me! If you could see me, you'd understand.No, you're blind.A clue why our Ivar shelving unit's about to fall the fuck apart.Just clocking time `til this arm plows through puberty. I've got a new Christmas Day.Now, ya may want to leave the room. I bet it feels huge in this hand.I'm about to lose what's left of my shit. Is there a word for half-afraid, half- furious?Fuck.We gotta find her fast. Before fuck-ass.I come for the French Onion Soup. How do you think? I'm constantly stalking that fox.Every time I see her is like the first time.Even from this angle. Especially from this angle.Shittiest moment numero tres.Lezzdothis. Before I re-reconsider. Maximum effort.Sorry. I get very uncomfortable around you guys. Crisp high five?Mother-fucker best be wearing his brown pants.And... numero dos.Ripley from `Alien 3'!It's like you knew I was about to knock! Is that big steel dildo home?Like there's something wrong with eating before sundown. Or saving money. But no. It's about me saving my girl from a bad guy, the one you two helped me lose. You do fight bad guys? No time for hard stares, are you gonna fetch big-shiny-balls or not? Tell him I have an offer he can't refuse!Yep, that's me, seeing the error of my ways! I just need an itty bitty favor in return! Fool him five times? Shame on him. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15And we've all seen what I can do with twelve.Careful, Ronnie Milsap, we're down-range! And we decided on the Orrberg, not the Borgsjo.The coolest. Plus, she could never pick you out of a line-up.It's Francis. He wants me to come to him. And he calls me a piece of-Uh-uh-uh.Please. It's been years since you've hit anything. See what I did there?In case I never see you again, I love you very much... and there's a hundred-ten million dollars buried somewhere in the apartment. Good luck. Watch your face.Any luck winning Gita back?It's all relative.Oh, please. I'll bet the halls of your high school were very well monitored.You mean ESP. But come on! I coulda-Gaaaahhhh!Twinkly, but deadly. My big Russki friend doesn't like the idea of a whole new army of mutant mutton-heads. And I told him if he did me this solid, I'd consider joining his boy band.Sure it's not.Uh. Dopinder. What was that?Something must've gotten lost in the translation.Seriously. This is no way to win Gita's heart. Return Bandhu home safe and gentle-like. And then woo Gita with your boyish charm...For you? Ten.Time to make the chimichangas.Not often a dude ruins your face. Destroys your living. Grabs your future baby mama. Personally sees to 8 of your 10 shittiest life moments. And plans to lather-rinse-repeat on a buncha new chumps. Let's just say, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas...It happens. A'ight, cue up DMX again.Gahhhhhhh!Goddamnit! Never mind. Nothing that can't be fixed by two swords and... ...maximum effort. Gimme a beat!Long term, that's hard on your knees. Super-hero landing! Clearly you're far too much dude for me. Which is why... ...I brought him.I also brought her.I feel sorry for the guy who tries to pressure her into prom sex.Finish fucking her the fuck up.Hey, fellas, whoa! Hold on! Don'tcha wanna hear my terms?!You guys only work for that shit-spackled Muppet fart! So I'm gonna give y'all the chance to lay down your firearms in return for preferential - bordering on gentle - possibly even lover-like treatment.Fine. Commando. Stay down, kid. Unless your power's stopping bullets.Tea-bag! Bob?!It's been since... Jacksonville!Liked the Loaded Potato Skins. Didn't like you.Bob, y'mind taking a half-step right? No, your right. Never mind-Yoo-hoo!Light the candle...Your plan to trip me to death? Has failed.You were right, babe. Red is my color.You never left.I hope they blocked pain to your every last nerve. `Cause I'm'a go looking.Good one.Let's dance. And by dance I mean try to kill each other.Yowww!Sounds like your last Saturday night. The sense of humor survived.Since you can't feel it? I just knocked out your tooth.We have so much to catch up on.I'm good.\u00a1Caramba! For heaven's sake!Wham! Wham! Wham!There are no words.Me and you are headed to fix this face. Or else...Um. What?You mean to say, after five long years, I've been chasing the wrong monkey?Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for? Any last words? Good. I got one: Francis.I'm sorry?To...?You were droning on! I may be stuck looking like pepperoni flatbread, but at least we've heard the last of him. If wearing super-hero tights means sparing psychopaths, maybe I wasn't meant to wear `em. Not everyone monitors a hall like you.I'll be on the lookout for the next four moments.(peers between Colossus andAnyone else turned on? That's what I love about y-I totally deserved that! That too! Maybe not the nethers.I'm so sorry. For leaving. And taking so long to cowboy up. It's been a rough few years.I live in a crack house. With a family of twelve. At night, we spoon for warmth. Everyone fights for Noelle. She's the fattest.There's nothing we don't share. Floor space. Dental floss. Condoms.I woulda found you before now. But the guy behind this mask isn't the same guy you remember.And this one. In case the other fell off.Oo. Ah. Quicker - like a Bandaid! Owww- di 5000.Sure?I understand.You already did. Twice. Seriously?I'm also not the same under these pants. Super-penis.Gah! What the hell are you two still doing here?! You, go clean some chalk-board erasers, or be a... really Big Brother, or teach fat kids to eat lettuce. And you, Chicken Noodle. Well... I feel something stupid coming on. Gaaaaaaahhhhhh!I am?! Omigod. That. Was. Not. Mean! Seriously, guys, it was a pleasure. For a second there, we felt like... like... ...five mini lion robots forming a large super robot.Now, I meant it, both of you, fire up the Blackbird and shoo! Scram! Vamoose! Skedaddle! Don't make me keep thinking of these!Where were we, darlin'? Oh, riiight. The best part.`Wham!' As promised.See, life can smell like Daffodil Daydream.

Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15..will be so much easier if you do.Which brings us to shittiest moment number 1! The guy behind the guy, Dr. Killebrew, off scot-free.But let's look on the bright side. You smell what I smell? I mean besides stale popcorn and my post-fight man-funk?Sequel. Maybe even one of those ensemble team movies...So, `til next time, this is your friendly neighborhood pool guy saying... I'm never gonna dance again... the way I danced with you.You're still here? It's over! Go home. Wait... you expected a tease for Deadpool 2?! Sorry, we're low on dough. But if you can keep a secret, I can tell you who's gonna be in it. Cable! Someone suggested Mel Gibson for the role, buuuut- I was thinking Liam Neeson. Only problem, Liam likes to get paid. And more for Liam means less for me. Maybe we'll crowdfund the shit. Just you and me, kids. Shalom!You're still here? It's over! Go home. Wait... you expected a tease for Deadpool 2?! Maybe a little Samuel L. Jackson? Sorry, that budget went to Weasel's Ketamine habit. But if you can keep a secret, I can tell you who's gonna be in it. Cable! You're allowed to show your pleasure. I'd love Liam Neeson for the role, but Liam likes to get paid. And more for Liam means less for me. So we'd best crowdfund the shit.
