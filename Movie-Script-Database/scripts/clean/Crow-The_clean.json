Good shot.Stay.Morphine is bad for you.Magic.Neither.Does it hurt?I have some pain killer right here.Your pain ends now.Go away.Shut up.Your daughter is out there, on the street, waiting for you.Go. Now.Freeze.I saw it, too.Walk with me.I need you to tell me what you remember. What happened to us?The venom of bad memories. You were there; you saw her. I saw you seeing her.My name.Thirty hours. A day of life, plus change...Halloween is coming, soon. You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.Thank you. For giving a damn.Don't smoke these.I'm your passenger. You drive. And stop talking.Faster, T-Bird. Faster. You're a hell of a wheelman; you know you can drive faster.That's good. We're going someplace you've never been before.You caught one. Drive faster.I want you to stop talking. And drive. Drive faster.You're very popular. Thought you could handle this thing.Naturally.Time for your reward, T. Payback with interest earned.A little restrictive? Good. You held her down and raped her. You were the first. She burned while you were inside of her. What's the lag on this? About twenty seconds, would you say?I've comrades in hell, T-bird. Give them my best.All gone.That's better.It's almost time.You have to be SKank. One moment.Thank of a snappy comeback for me on your way down.Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...Do you know what you destroyed?A year ago. A very nice lady circulated a petition. She died. Last Halloween. Answer yes or no.It's yesterday! Do you know what you destroyed?You don't even remember...Rowdy. Let me fill in some gaps for you.You're a detail man, Top -- you need to see more.All of her pain, Top. Thirty hours.

It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...They couldn't do anything for me.No. I have one more thing to do.I have to prepare for an anniversary. This coming night.A remembrance. A closure.Better now. I feel good. How are you, Elly, my friend?What is it?You brought flowers. As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.Elly...Sometimes the people we care about are gone, for no reason. Sometimes that's really tough. I cry. But if the people we love are gone, we keep them ---- right here. It's a big responsibility. And that makes it okay to mourn. I know that if you weren't here, I'd be very sad.Somebody here wants to meet you. Gabriel?I think he's yours, now.I have something else for you.Shelly would've wanted you to have it. This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...Tell me I'll get hurt. That I might die. I've already done that. I don't need anyone's help. Yours included.Fine with me.I'm already alone.Don't waste my time.But why are you still here?I can see her.I want the girl. Unharmed. Now.You're too late. There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to. But he turned to dust and blew away. I don't have any power for you to take.This isn't your place. This isn't your fight. And I don't need your help.Leave here. Don't do this. I don't want you here.Don't interfere.Here I am.And how many lives have you destroyed?You're right, I'm not an avenger.
