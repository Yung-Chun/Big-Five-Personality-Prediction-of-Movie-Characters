{"American-Gangster": {"FRANK": {"raw_line": "What is it?Somebody call an ambulance!All right.Yeah.I'll be fine, Charlie. Half the people here owed Bumpy money when he died. A lot of money. If they think I'm going to forget to collect, they're wrong.Fuckin crooks.It's chaos. Every gorilla for himself.Thank you, Charlene. Last one.Then maybe I'll have to go for a walk. Just cause you said so.How's Nate? You seen him?Where, Saigon?You're gonna have to boot it a couple times. Cops keep cutting it, selling it, cutting it -Twenty percent?Twenty percent's my profit. If I'm giving it to you then what am I doing? Twenty percent puts me, and everyone you know, out of business, which puts you out of business. There are ways to make money legitimately, and then there's this way. Not even Bumpy took twenty percent.There. That's twenty-percent.Get yourself a new suit.A hundred kilos.That's not what I want.No, even then it's too late. It's been chopped. I want to get it where they get it. From the source.Why not.I've lived in jungles all my -They ain't Chinese.What do you care?What do you care?It says right there. Frank Lucas.Me.Then there'd be more. On a regular basis. Though I'd rather not have to drag my ass all the way up here every time.Give them a hundred.A hundred. And it's all I got left. So if that dope doesn't arrive, for whatever reason - Cousin or no cousin - don't let me down.Take it with you. I don't want to have to call the coroner.You show me after supper.Is that right.This is your room.I had it made. From memory.I remember.I was with him every day for fifteen of them, looking after him, taking care of things, protecting him, learning from him.Bumpy was rich, but never white man rich. Why? Because he didn't own the company. He thought he did. He didn't. He only managed it. Someone else owned it. So they owned him.Nobody owns me. Because I own my company.And my company sells a product that's better than the competition's at a price that's lower.Honey, these are my brothers.What matters in business is honesty, integrity, hard work, loyalty, and never forgetting where you came from.You are what you are and that's one of two things. You're nothing ... or you're something. Understand what I'm saying?I'll be right back.Hey, Tango, what's up. I was just thinking about you.I was looking at the jar and you know what? I didn't see nothing in it.Yeah, that's right.For the cops. Should be enough.That basically's the whole picture right there.No loan, no contingencies. Cash sale.Who's the beauty queen?What is this?I'm wearing clothes. These are clothes. Those - - are a costume. With a sign on it that says Arrest me. You look like fuckin Jackie Fox.You like Jackie? You want to be Superfly? Go work for him, end up in a cell with him.The guy making all the noise in the room is the weak one. That's not who you want to be.You and Jackie were talking about me?I'm taking you shopping tomorrow.You go shopping every day. Like a girl.How much you owe?Sure. Don't worry about it.Joe. It's a gift. Not a loan. You don't owe me nothing.I'm Frank.Because I don't have to.I got it.I hope you weren't waiting long. A woman as beautiful as you shouldn't have to wait for anything.You really don't know who that is? It's Martin Luther King.You're right. He was as important as Dr. King, though.A lot of things. He had a lot of friends. He served New York and it served him.Teacher.How to take my time ... how if you're going to do something, do it with care ... do it with love.How be a gentleman.I got five different apartments in the city I could've taken you to. I brought you here instead -To meet my mother.I deal with enough crooks as it is.Mr. Sibota. What can I get you?It's been his dream all his life to play for the Yankees - and he's good enough.I can't have this kind of stupidity.He doesn't feel shit, coked up all the time. Get rid of him.Gimme those glasses.Pull -Too many things to look after right now to think about that.Bumpy was interested in a lot of things.He didn't have what you needed. You had what he needed. We've always had to come to you.I'm just trying to make a living.I set a price I think is fair.I'm thinking of them as much as they ever thought of me.I don't need it. I already got everything from 110th Street to Yankee Stadium, river to river.You pay what a kilo now, 75, 80? I'd consider 50. And I can get you as much as you want. Tosca slips on his best poker face. Fifty thousand a kilo would be an extraordinary coup for him.They look at me like it's Christmas and I'm Santa Claus.No. They're working for me now.What is it?I wish Bumpy could've met her. I wish she could've met him.Stay in the carDetective.Listen to me. Before you say another word - about her - or me - remember that you're saying it on the most important fuckin day of my life.I don't know what you're talking about.You want to keep talking, talk to my lawyer, here's his card. You call him, because we're done here -If you're not getting your share, it's not my fault, go ask the chief of police.No, you're all the fuckin same.Detective ... There are some things you don't do. This is one of them. Not on a man's wedding day.Stevie. Come over here. I heard you didn't show up.You're too busy to meet with Billy Martin? After I set it up?What're you talking about? This is your dream since you were their age - Maybe I can set it up again.You tested it. You're sure.The fuck you looking at?We need to talk.That's not why I'm here. Everybody's happy, Jackie. Charlie, Baz, the cops, the Italians, everybody. Everybody except you.Then I don't understand. Why do you have to take something that's perfectly good the way it is, and wreck it?Brand names mean something, Jackie. Consumers rely on them to know what they're getting. They know the company isn't going to try to fool them with an inferior product. They buy a Ford, they know they're gonna get a Ford.Not a fuckin Datsun. Blue Magic is a brand name; as much a brand name as Pepsi. I own it. I stand behind it. I guarantee it and people know that even if they don't know me any more than they know the chairman of General Foods.What you're doing, as far as I'm concerned, when you chop my dope down to five percent, is trademark infringement.That's not true. That's where you're wrong.Jackie, you don't need to. You don't need to make more money than you can with Blue the way it is. No one does. At a certain point it's just greed.I have to insist. You call it Blue Magic, that's misrepresentation.That's all I'm saying. Wrap it in red cellophane and -Whack it down to nothing, tie a bow around it and call it Blue Dogshit if you want, just don't let me catch you doing this again.You don't go over there any more.It's all right, pull over, what are they going to do? Give us a ticket?Detective. How's it going? You have a nice Thanksgiving?Where's the Shelby?We're gonna shut the trunk and say good night, forget you pulled us over.I don't know, would you rather it's your fuckin house blows up next time?I know.Don't you ever put me in a car with dope in it.Yeah, I see them.Here you go, boys. Merry Christmas.Paying cops is one thing, I understand that. I been paying them since I was ten - put more of their kids through college than the National Merit Award. This is different, this Special Investigations Unit. They think they are special.Someone's been following me. Besides cops. I see cars where they shouldn't be. Guys I don't know -Bumpy hardly ever went out at a certain point. He stayed in - read - watched TV - played chess. I thought he chose to lead a quiet life. He didn't. He couldn't go out without something happening.Where? With who? Everyone I know is under surveillance. I can't even be with my family at Christmas anymore.I do pay them, I pay them all. Cops, accountants, lawyers, who don't I pay? Everybody. I pay them a fortune, it doesn't matter. It doesn't satisfy them. The more you pay, the more they expect.You can't start with them because they can't stop. It's like dope. They always want more.Put on something nice, we're going out.Keep going.Fuck that. I'm not going to sneak into my own club. Just drive.You can carry it all? We ordered a lot.Don't forget the yellow sauce. 244 OMIT 244 OMITDoc's got the keys. Let's go back.I'm not leaving you on the street.What the fuck was that?Who didn't like Charlie? Everybody liked Charlie ...Go home. Go see your kids.What are you doing? Where've you been?What money?In your car?Where's the car?With ten million dollars in it?Are you crazy? Take it back to Teaneck. What are you doing driving around without security? Doc'll take you back.To go where? No, we're not.Shhh. Come on, now. Shhh.Where are we going to go? Spain? China? Which fuckin place is it going to be?We can run and hide is what you're saying.This is where I'm from. This is where my family is. My business. My mother. This is my place. This is my country. This is America.\"I can guarantee you peace of mind,\" you said. Do I look like a man with peace of mind to you? They shot at my wife. Who does that?Then maybe I'll kill them all just to make a fuckin point.I'm watching the news. Where the hell's everyone going?Just like that? We're going to leave the fuckin country to the communists?I haven't!I'll figure something out. You'll see me again. The General seems fond of Frank, and not only because of all the money on the table.That's what my wife thinks.Give them half!Cut half of them loose! The mules!Newark. Short Term Parking Lot 3.Tomorrow will be fine.Ten million dollars means nothing to me.This - is his death warrant.Is that where I'm going?You think you got Frank Lucas. You got nothing.Here he is, let me talk to him alone.I just heard something. I said it couldn't be true. You didn't really turn in a million dollars you found in the trunk of a car, did you?Want me to tell you what happened to it? It ended up in cops' pockets.Maybe? No. It did. All you did was give it to them for nothing in return. Not nothing: You got their contempt.Why'd you do that? What're you trying to prove, you're better than them? You're not better than them. You are them.You did it because it was right. That's all. Why's that hard to say? The question is would you do it again? That was a long time ago. It'd be very easy to find out. Tell me you want to find out, tell me the address, and a car will be there, the trunk loaded.Who the fuck are you to say no to that? You think that impresses me?Let me ask you something. You think by putting me in jail, you're going to stop even one junkie from dying? Because you won't. If it isn't me, it'll be someone else. With me or without me, nothing's going to change.You have any sort of case? Or just that idiot drives for my brother. Is he your case? Because if it's just him and the powder, it's not enough.My brothers won't talk to you. My cousins. None of my family. No one but that mother fucking driver.Bullshit.Who the fuck are they? I don't know them and they don't know me.This is who you're going to put on the stand? Guys who don't know me? Who got nothing to do with me?I don't represent nothing.Look at me. You looking? Can you tell by looking it would mean nothing to me if tomorrow you turned up dead?What can we do?I could give you cops, but that's not who you want, is it. You want organized crime names.You'll take them, too? You'd go after cops? Are you serious? You'd do that? Lock up your own kind?What can you promise me?You know, I don't care if the feds take all my buildings, my stocks, my off-shore accounts. They can take it all, I don't care - use it to build battleships, paint bridges, whatever the fuck they want. Fight another war. But those other motherfuckers - the cops - put my money in their pockets. Millions.Oh, I remember them all. That's not the problem.The jail's aren't big enough.You go up here. Your \"special.\"Frederick Douglass Boulevard? What was wrong with just plain 8th Avenue?I used to sit here with Ana in my old car. She hated it. Now I don't even have a car. Or her.Just do what?The fuck is that? Just do what?Who the fuck would buy those?I haven't talked to them in years. It's better that way. For them. I don't know where they are. Went back to Greensboro when they got out, I guess.What am I going to do now, be a janitor? What do I know how to do? How am I going to live?You told me but you can barely take care of yourself.You know, one phone call, Richie, I could be back in business.I won't.

FBI?You know why I don't have it.No, they're all on the take and I'm not and it doesn't matter to anyone. Instead of giving you a medal for turning in money, they bury you.I'll do it, but only like this: I don't set foot in a police station again. I work out of a place of my own. And I pick my own guys. Guys I know wouldn't take a nickel off the sidewalk.This is the only floor we'll be using.I'm reluctant to bring anyone in I don't personally know.Where are they? Spearman looks out across the crowded dance floor.Our mandate is to make major arrests. No street guys - we want the suppliers - the distributors.Heroin, cocaine, amphetamines. No grass under a thousand pounds. Less than that, someone else can waste their time.We'll be handling big shipments, big money, big temptation. Yeah.It's not true.You paid ten bucks for it?Now, how is that possible? Who can afford to sell shit twice as good for half as much? Richie glances to a Table of Organization: Surveillance photos haphazardly thumb-tacked to a bulletin board - known dope men in the hierarchies of their individual crime families - almost all of them Italian.For a cop the uppermost thing is the arrest. For a prosecutor, the arrest is nothing without the evidence to convict. We don't have any real evidence on anyone on this board, so they're coming down. We're starting over from the street.It'll never be out of my sight.It's got to be `Blue Magic.'That's half. I'll give you the other half tomorrow when you give -What are they going to do, arrest us?We're not losing that money. Go.Get out.Get the fuck out of the car!That's my money.The bills are sequenced and registered with the Essex County Prosecutors Office. All begin with CF3500. Take a look.Honest mistake. Just give it back to me.Yeah, I know, like everyone else. Some of them will steal no matter what. There can be a camera on them they'll do it. Some'll never do it. The rest are capable of either, depending how their department leans ... Only theirs isn't leaning, it's fallen over. The patrol cars don't even stop in Harlem, just roll down the window so the dealers can throw the money in. I saw drops made on precinct steps.It's where this dope is coming from. Blue Magic. Out of New York. What am I supposed to do, ignore it?He wouldn't stop. Motherfucker almost ran me over.I told him I was a cop. I showed him my identification.I was chasing your 20 thousand dollars.Then my investigation's over.I know.Tony, the things she's telling Child Social Services make me look very bad: Out all night. Lowlife informants hanging around. Women -Thank you.You don't have to talk about it, you don't want. What do you hear about Blue Magic? Anything?Nothing about who's bringing it in?Down south, Florida? Cubans? What.Mr. Louis -I'm sorry, but I just have to tell you, sir, you were a hero to me growing up. I still push elevator buttons eight times for the rounds you beat Billy Conn in. For luck.That's is the plate number on the limo. Check with the company, who rented it.No, he's bigger than that. His seats were phenomenal; better than Al Tosca's. Joe Louis and Ali shook his fuckin hand.Originally from Greensboro, North Carolina. Couple of arrests years ago. Gambling, robbery, unlicensed firearm.For fifteen years he was Bumpy Johnson's collector, bodyguard and driver. He was with him when he died.Five brothers, he's the oldest, lots of cousins, all living here now, spread out around the boroughs and Jersey. The brothers are -Except for the chinchilla coat, which no one can explain, Frank's life seems orderly and legitimate.Has breakfast at a Midtown place, usually alone.Then goes to work. Meeting with his accountant, or lawyer, dropping in on one of the several office buildings he owns.Nights, he usually stays home. When he does go out, it's to a club or dinner - with his new wife - friends, celebrities, sports figures - never O.C. guys.Sundays he takes his mother to church. Then drives out to change the flowers on Bumpy's grave. Every Sunday, no matter what.Neither was Bumpy Johnson's and he owned Harlem.Is it? Everything he does, he does like Bumpy.We haven't seen that again. That apparently has been retired to the closet.Won't get any informants. Not inside. It's like a Sicilian family. Like he's structured his own family the same way to protect himself.Being with Bumpy long as he was, he would have been around Italians a lot. Enough to learn that much.But it's not even Frank Lucas I want. I want to know who he's working for: Which Italians are bringing the heroin in.Yeah -Because it's an attempted homicide, that's Grand Jury. Now, that Grand Jury could come in very favorably. Might turn out to be Attempted Manslaughter. Self Defense even. She had a knife. Depends on how I want to deal with you. You see where this is going.Let's say you beat it somehow. What do you think Cousin Frank'll think of that? He knows you had to sit here listening to something like this. And then you beat an attempted murder? Is he stupid? He'll assume you talked.You fucked up, Jimmy. But nobody knows. Frank doesn't know. Yet. Do you want him to read about it in the paper? Or do you want to walk out of here - no bail, no trial - just walk out, now.Yeah. Tony. How's it going?The fuck is a `micro' wave?Of what.No, thanks. I don't want one.This is nice, where's this?I'd like to ski Aspen some day.This is your place?If I don't report what you just said to me, you know I could be in a lot of trouble. If I do, then it's you.From who, your uncle? Why would you do this? Why would you risk our friendship?You shouldn't have done it.He's not important enough for you to do this.Tell Marie I'm sorry I had to leave. You can tell her why.INS, FBI, IRS - I can't get anything out of them. Nothing on his travel, his bank accounts, property holdings - nothing.They don't want this to stop. It employs too many people. Cops, lawyers, judges, probation officers, prison guards. The day dope stops coming into this country, a hundred thousand people lose their jobs. Toback isn't as sure the corruption of the official world is that complete.Who took it out? If there's a contract on me, it would be nice to know who took it out.No. I don't. Not when it's my life.Who? FBI? You're going to protect me?Talk.Laurie. I'm sorry I couldn't give you the kind of life you wanted. I'm sorry it was never enough. But don't punish me for being honest. Don't take my son away.I'm not.You're right. This is no place for him. Around me. Take him. The further away the better. For him.I'm crazy. Can't you tell that? I'm crazy enough to shoot someone and make it look like an accident next time he comes over the bridge without my permission. Get the fuck out of New Jersey.None of you ever been in the service? It's an Air Force tail number.Captain, I'm Richard Roberts, Director of the Essex County Narcotics Bureau.Open it.The warrant permits me to search the plane and its cargo.I don't need it.There are drugs on that plane -I had good information the target of my investigation was bringing dope in on that plane.Frank Lucas.He's not Italian. He's black.I believe Frank Lucas is above the mafia in the dope business. I believe he buys direct from the source in Southeast Asia, cuts out all the middlemen, and uses US military planes and personnel to bring pure No. 4 heroin into United States.I was promised when I took this job, it was about real arrests.I have cases against most of Frank's organization. Not him -That's right.Yeah, you'd know, sitting here, having never been on the -Lou. We're ready to go in there knowing there's a good chance we won't all come out. That's what we're willing to do. All I'm asking you to do get me a warrant.We don't have a lot of time to fuck around -It'll be here.What kind of trees are these?Thank you, your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen -Maybe.I don't have the time or interest to listen to -No, thanks.Then that's the way it is.Then you got nothing to worry about.I got more than that. I got a line of people wanting to testify that stretches out the door and around the block.Is it? Tony the Bug. Benny Two-Socks. Carmine Camanetti.They sell dope for the Mazzano crime family. Which you all but put out of business.They have everything to do with you. And the only thing they hate more than you is what you represent.You don't? Black businessman like you? Of course you do. But once you're gone, things can return to normal.Get in line. That one stretches around the block, too.You know what you have to do.I'll take them, too. I want them all.They're not. Not the ones in business with you. They're not my kind any more than the Italians are yours.I can promise you if you lie to me about one name, you'll never get out of prison. Lie about one dollar in one offshore account, you'll never get out. You can live rich in jail the rest of your life, or poor outside it, that's what I can promise.I believe it.I want to know everyone you've met for the last twenty years. Everyone you sold to.
