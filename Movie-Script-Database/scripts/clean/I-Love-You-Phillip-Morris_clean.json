{"I-Love-You-Phillip-Morris": {"STEVEN": {"raw_line": "Love sure is a funny thing... It makes you happy. Makes you sad. Makes you do all sorts of things you never thought you'd do before. Love's the reason I'm here actually.It hurt a bit, but I decided I wasn't gonna let it get me down. No way. I was gonna be the best son- No, the best person I could be. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 4.Hey fellas.Have lots of dreams...Amen.Amen.Okay let's wrap it up...Amen.I'm absolutely bushed.Deb- You know how, as a cop, I have lots of access? You know- records and things?Now do you think it's, you know, unethical, to use that to find my mother? \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 7.I swear honey- getting around the system's so easy. No one would even know I did it.You're right, I shouldn't have done it.I haven't looked. It's downstairs.Well hold on- let me finish.There- that's got it.She's right here. She's been right here all this time. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 8.Yeah. No question.Are you Barbra Bascombe?In a manner of speaking, yes. You gave up a baby for adoption, correct?Elizabeth City? St Jude's Hospital? Remember?You were young. I know that you made a mistake giving me away, but-Shhhhhh. Mommy please- let me finish.We all make mistakes. What I came here to say is, I forgive you because none of us is perfect but now with a fresh start we can build --No, it's okay, I know everything. But it's fine. Just tell me why--Okay, okay. I understand. It's a lot at once. But I can come back. How's that? I can come back later, I'll bring us some coffee and we can talk about... WHY YOU ABANDONED ME AND KEPT YOUR OTHER TWO CHILDREN! I WAS THE MIDDLE CHILD! WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME?! WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME!?I quit the force that day. I packed up the family and moved to Texas. I got a great job and got to living the American Dream.In the laundry room.No I haven't. I hope you're planning on changing the paint. What do you call that color?Good, good, good... good.Virginia Beach.Yeah, kinda lost interest. Got back into the family business.Produce. I work for Sysco.Yes sir-ee.And the hours don't crush me either. I get plenty of home time.Among other things...I'm gonna come, I'm gonna come...Oh did I forget to mention I was gay? Yeah, sorry about that. I'm gay. Gay, gay, gay, gay, gay. Have been as long as I can remember...Anyway where was I? Oh yeah--And I did.I had been living a lie for a long, long time. I tend to do that... hide things.Now just because I was screwing around doesn't mean I didn't love Debbie. I did. I loved her with all my heart... Stephanie too. My family was all I had and they needed me. So I told myself it was just a little lie and it was better for everybody if it stayed that way. That's what I told myself. But life has a way of forcing these things into the light.You might even call it an epiphany.I haven't lived my life.Fuck you... No one is going to tell me what to do anymore. No more lies. I'm going to live my life. My way. Be the real me. Time for some good living. Buy what I want, do what I want, fuck who I want. My way.I'm gonna be a fag.A big fag...Yep, just like that I decided to start my life over and live it like the real me. No more lies. I was born again.It would be hard to break it to Debbie, but I knew I'd find a way... \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 16.Honey, I'm gay!To my surprise, we stayed friends. And I was finally free.Life was good. Everything was falling right into place. I moved to Florida, got a new job, had two adorable pups, I was dating a cute guy named Jimmy. I could do anything I wanted...But it didn't take me long to realize something that never occurred to me before. Actually no one ever talks about this but......being gay is really expensive. It is.I mean it's not just sucking cock. It's wardrobe, it's hair, personal trainers, big labels, resorts, fine dining... it goes on and on and on. So I needed money. And for a guy without a college education, my options were limited.So I had no choice-- I became a con man!Of course that was easy for me, every closet case is a con anyways.Thank you.Now it didn't happen all at once. It was sort of a gradual thing...It started with work. Tomatoes. I used to buy low grade tomatoes in the field and sell them to clueless chain stores as higher grade.Finest in the land...It's called `field buying'. I could clear three thousand dollars in a good week doing that. But frankly it wasn't enough.Charge...Steven A Russell, Steven G Russell, Steven M Russell, Doctor Steven M Russell, Doctor Steven J Russell... Ah!Of course.But when money got really tight, the slip and fall always came in handy.What do you think? Yes? \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 20.You don't like it.You don't like it.Tell me what's wrong with it. Is it the gold?That's why I got you the stainless!The gold one is for me, dipshit.Merry Christmas!Hi Debbie! \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 21.Good. Did you get the gifts?You're welcome!Why not?Not Christian? Why's that?So you're saying you know what the Lord wants?It's the leap of faith Deb. It's the not knowing that's the answer.Of course, Jimmy and Debbie had no idea what I was up to. For the time being, at least...Morning Sandy!Okey-dokey!Federal Marshalls...They wanted me for all sorts of stuff- Insurance fraud, identity theft, passport fraud. They were probably gonna extradite me all the way back to Texas. I had to decide what to do next. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 23.But one thing was for sure-- I was not gonna let them put me away. I was a cop and I knew what jail was like. And there was no way I was going there. I had a plan.Yep. Everything was gonna be just fine.Sorry.I can't go to prison, Jimmy. I can't. I can't go to prison. I can't. I can't...Hi. Welcome to prison. I'm Steven.Oh don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt you. First time?Shit, I was so scared when I first got here. But you get used to it. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 28.Only took me a year. You just need to know a few ins and outs and you'll be fine.You're gonna catch a beating any day now, that's just the way it is. I lost three teeth and cracked a vertebrae. Anyway, all you need to do is fight back. Win or lose, just fight back. Or you could try to suck the guys' dick. Your choice.Law Library. I pretty much live here. I don't really have anyone on the outside except my ex-wife- so I just hunker down here learning everything there is to know about the law. Ask me anything.See him. Over there? Him? Anything you want from outside, he's the guy. Candy, cigarettes, drugs, whatever. He's the guy. Just keep in mind- it's gonna cost you a lot of money. Or you could suck his dick. Your choice.Three meals a day. Not so bad. Just make sure if you make enemies with someone, he doesn't work here. Otherwise you'll wake up one morning shitting blood and find out you've been eating ground glass in your cornbread for six weeks.Let me introduce you to the mail guy. His name's Gary.Your choice.Well that's about it. You're gonna be fine. Don't worry. And if you need anything you just let me know. Alright?That'd be great.Hey Debbie. Hi Sweetheart. Sorry I missed you. I thought one o'clock was our time but maybe not. I sure miss you guys. Thanks for the picture and the article. Sometimes it's just nice to know there's someone out there who still cares about me since Jimmy left and all. So... uh...Do you think I broke his heart? Sorry. Sometimes I forget it's just the machine... I'll try you again next time. One O'clock. Don't forget.Glad to help. How's the bird?Oh, I'm sorry.Civil law? You know, I'm an attorney.You suing someone?Does he have a lawyer? \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 32.Have him get in touch with the Prisoner Rights Committee. They deal with this all the time- pro bono. I've got the number.My name's Steven Russell.I haven't seen you around Phillip. I'm always in the yard...It is kind of rough out there. You don't look like you belong here Phillip.Why are you here?Grand theft?Insurance fraud.No. Me. Insurance fraud.Don't seem fair, does it?You know, I keep finding that life's a little shittier than I thought it was gonna be.I guess I'm inclined to believe you.I met you today, didn't I?...I made the mistake of writing her and saying I was lonely in here. And next thing you know, my ex-wife catches her putting the neighbor's puppy in a box to mail to me.Oh she's an angel. I think I'll be sure to write her back and tell her I'm not lonely anymore... that I made a good friend.What?Something wrong?What?Don't be sorry. It's just across the yard.It's not gonna change a thing, Phillip. In fact, Friday the 13th's my lucky day. Don't worry, this right here. This is destiny.Listen, I've loved a lot. And I've been around, so I recognize the feeling. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 35.That one you and me are having right now- the one you're trying to forget exists because you're going away. But there's about 6000 volts shooting across this table here and you know you can't deny it.I know you're trying to protect yourself, I get that. It's fine. Give me a chance to prove you wrong.Good...Phillip, hope your new place is nice. Nice enough anyway. I hope the chocolate made it to you okay. Check the T.P.I hope you try to make some new friends and not be too shy. I guess I should tell you a little bit about myself...I know a guy. I took care of it. I'm gonna take care of everything...Really? What's a Broadway producer doing in Atlanta?What'd you do for him?Apache? What was his name?Phillip- you amaze me.That's what I'm saying- you only see the good.What the hell was that?You poor thing. How awful... \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 40.Me?Well you said he bothered you.Yeah. Yeah, I did.I just want you to be happy, baby.What?No. No... I can't dance.No I can't. I'm serious...Well not me. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 43.Ah shit...Don't you touch him!Don't worry Phillip- I'll-What the hell are you doing!?I love you too!We'll be together soon! I promise!Those were the longest three months of my life. I wrote to Phillip every day until I got released.And once I did, I was determined to get us back together as soon as possible.Hi, how are you?Nearest thrift store please.Hi there, my name's Steven Rousseau. I'm an attorney. My client is Phillip Morris. I called earlier.I beg your pardon?I got work to do honey, I'm getting you out of here early. I got a hearing tomorrow morning, I got motions to file. The law don't sleep baby.Phillip, you are the sweetest, most gentle man I have ever met. And I know people have taken advantage of that. But I don't ever want you ever to lose that innocence. I want to build a life with you Phillip. I want to protect you.The motion was filed, I presented to the DA and got a letter from the judge- I do not understand what the hold up is. I'm not some paralegal- I am Steven fucking Rousseau and I expect proper adjudication!My boyfriend's getting out of prison next week!You want mayo with that?I have an early release order for Phillip Morris.I'm his lawyer.I know.Can I get you all a drink? \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 52.We gotta get a bigger place.Eudora...I could certainly try.Sure- why not?It would be my pleasure. Litigation is my speciality.Sorry I'm late but I've been hung up in court all day. Let's go in.It's a beautiful fixture.Oh... Your Honor, Ms. Mixon engaged Mr. Gage service in good faith and was given an inferior product. She is entitled to deem that work to be unacceptable according to the contract that Mr. Evans signed.Your honor I have, in my briefcase, fourteen other contracts, all on public record, in which Mr. Evans entered into litigation with past clients of his!I demand to be seen in chambers!!I'll admit your honor- I'm a plain spoken man. I didn't go to Princeton. I didn't go to Yale. My education was modest. I went to a small school. I grew up on a small farm. But I passed the same bar exam as my colleague here and I am not going to let him push around this humble woman.I think it's obvious where I'm going with this sir.Your honor, that's exactly what I'm talking about.YES! I did great! Can you believe how great I did!?I mean, I did great! Really great! I'm so proud of myself! You want half my sandwich?!No! We're going out! I'm paying!!I thought you'd like it honey.You let me worry about the money sweetheart.Not this weekend.I think we both need a vacation. Key West?Yeah?Oh you know... just... people I knew.Remember that guard? Skinny guy? Smoked a lot?Yeah, that's him.Actually- I was in the yard once. Another guard asked him to pay him back five. He opened his wallet and I saw this picture of a little girl about Steffie's age. So I brought it up to him once, just to get him talking. That's the thing about having kids, you know? Gets people talking. Shared experience. Builds bridges. Something I learned. Anyway he tells me he's worried about her- mamma was gone. We talked awhile. You know, I just listened. That's all. I brought up the candles just one time but mostly just listened... And the next day, bedtime, there they were.I didn't. I just knew I wanted `em for you... and I found a way to do it. That's all.That's it... \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 59.Uh huh... *With Phillip I felt strong. I felt invincible. I promised myself he would never want for anything ever again. That meant I needed a real job. Something dependable. And- no more scams.Were you a spaceman?A spaceman, huh? How do you crap up there?I could not speak more highly of Steven Russell, Mr. Lindholm . A real straight shooter. We were damn lucky to have him at Prudential as long as we did.On the Waterfront.That's fine... sure. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 62.Uh.... cup of coffee?Sure. What about?Mmm hm. Sure.Oh. Okay. Ummm...Well I did a lot of work here and uh... I think maybe... well I could just read it to you but uh... it might be better to just uh...Well, I'll just show you. Todd?If you look here at Mark's projections again for Q3, you'll see- well you'll see they're just that- projections. Projections based on a model set by my predecessor. I decided to reject that model and do things a little differently. I want to show you my results. This is what we actually made in Q3--Now let me tell you how I did it...It's just a work thing. Were we supposed to--Some stupid gala ball thing...Yeah. I'll be home early. Promise.No... Oh- is it...?Good things I hope.Uh... engaged.She works. Travels a lot. It's killing her she couldn't be here.These are ready for Dan ...Kind of. I just got back from my lawyer's office. I asked him, \"What's your fee?\" He says, \"I charge $50 for three questions.\" So I ask, \"Don't you think that's a little expensive?\" And he says, \"Yes it is... Now what's your final question?\"Yeah that's a good one... \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 68.What?It's work.I know...Wish me luck.Oh! This is easy! Your turn Dan!Oh yeah! How ya like that, sister!?Maybe it was because it's just my nature, or maybe it was because of my past... or maybe it was because they were the most boring fucking people I'd ever met in my life... Whatever the reason, I had been robbing them blind for months.Uh.... cup of coffee?The thing about U-SAMM was that they took in all this HMO money and distributed it to doctors. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 71.But in the time between receiving the money and paying it out- it was just sitting there, not making interest or anything.It occurred to me to set up an investment account where the held money would earn interest for the short time that the company had it. We're talking twenty two million at any given time here, so even short term the interest adds up pretty quickly. I'd be making the company millions virtually overnight....and I of course would take a commission. Say... fifty percent. The only problem with that was-- I wasn't the one signing the checks.So I ask, \"Don't you think that's a little expensive?\" and the lawyer says, \"Yes it is, now what's your final question?\"Oh... how long till we can get a new one?Really?! Great!Uhhh... yeah. Sure.Pretty big.No.Mmm hmm... \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 74.Phillip... what is it?No.There isn't. There's nothing.We're always going to be together. And there is nothing going on. I promise. I wouldn't lie to you, baby.Thanks, Larry.SL. That the C you're driving?Good car.Good value.I'M MAKING COPIES!!!CAN'T YOU SEE I'M SHREDDING!?Hey Debbie.Good. How's Steffie doing?She's interested in boys already?He's good. He says hi, but listen- I just wanted to call and let you know I'm switching all my phone numbers. I'll let you know when we get a new one.Deb, you always knew me best.Well, maybe this is his plan.Anyway Debbie- that's my boss calling. I love you both and I'll call you soon.Hello?The Gulf Freeway. Where are you?Is something wrong?Oh, that's nice Dan. But I don't think I'm coming back in. I think we both know why.Bye-bye Dan.Nothing. Thought we'd take a little vacation. Key West. Let's pack. Quick! Okay I'll pack for you!Now don't get angry, it's gonna be fun, I swear.Of course we are! We're never gonna be apart. Never.We'll get a place. Do some fishing. I can work on my key lime pie recipe......I might even grow a beard and enter the Papa Hemingway contest!Phillip? Honey?COME BACK! WAIT!There I was, keeping secrets, living a lie. Like I said, I tend to do that. Now I didn't blame Phillip for running out on me, but I had to make things right. I had to get him back. You see, there's something I didn't tell you... ...it's about my old boyfriend. Do you remember him? His name was Jimmy.I love you Jimmy.I know.Why the hell not?I don't give a shit about that.Hi baby. What do you mean? It's noon. I always call at noon. Well it's prison honey, it sucks. But I'm getting used to it. What's wrong?I know.I know, I'm sorry...You're not gonna die alone.You're not gonna die alone, okay? Just believe me.Yes I do. I promise.Did you get `em?What the hell's this?Jesus! \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 85.Lunch is served.Come on. You need to drink something.Well that's not okay with me baby. You can't leave. I need you around here. You're the love of my life.Shhhh...You're not thinking clearly baby. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 87.Okay, okay. Now drink some water.NO! JUST GIVE ME SOME TIME! I PROMISED! I PROMISED I'D BE THERE! I PROMISED HE WOULDN'T DIE ALONE!It's about damn time!Hi Helen it's me. Is--Okay... mmm hmm...I'm sorry I didn't tell you before. I just don't like talking about some things.Oh thanks.Yeah...I wasn't going to lose Phillip. No way. I broke Jimmy's heart and I was not gonna break Phillip's. I was gonna make everything alright. No matter what it took, I was going to escape.Shit!C'mon Phillip, pick up, it's me. I'm sorry. C'mon. Dammit!Not long. Can you hit me in the face with this?It sure hurts... \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 92.Nine hundred thousand!? It's a white collar charge.This is bullshit. Set a reduction hearing.Next week.On the thirteenth.Dearest Tyler. Long time no talk. I won't beat around the bush. I got into a spot of trouble here in Houston and find myself needing help. That's right, jail again. Anyway I was wondering if you could type up this thing for me on your computer just like I sketched out...Great!Ma'am?!Dropped something.Hi, I have Judge Charles Hearn for the clerk's office.I'll put him through.This the clerk's office?Charles Hearn- I got a bail adjustment coming through, sent it over today.Russell. Steven Jay.Good, I need that to go through right away. Because if it don't, I'm gonna have to chug about a quart of Tidee Bowl on account of all the shit I'll be eating. Know what I mean?And say- Julie? Can you save me a dime and connect me to a good bail bondsman?Phillip-Don't say that.Honey, I know you're upset- but we love each other. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 97.I'm sorry about that- they weren't supposed to find that. It was for your own good. So we could be together.C'mon Phillip, just trust me-Phillip don't say that.Well what am I supposed to do?Well...Open the door Phillip.Open the door. Just open the door. Open the door. Please. I just want to say one thing. Please. Just one thing. That's all. Please.Phillip?I love you.That was the last time I ever saw him....But I knew he was right. Phillip, Jimmy, Debbie- they've all been right. My whole life was nothing but a bunch of lies. Lies to make people love me, lies to keep them from leaving me and lies to make them give me their money.And in the process I lost track of who I was. Maybe Barbra Bascombe had me pegged right from the beginning and that's why she gave me up...Whatever the case, how does a person who doesn't exist go on existing? Well the answer is- he doesn't.How long do I have?So here we are, where you first met me...I've been in this bed for months now. Waiting to die. The only thing that keeps me going is the thought that I might get a chance to see Phillip one more time. But I don't know how much longer I can do this...I didn't want you to find out...Did I forget to mention I didn't die? Yeah, I didn't die. Faked the whole thing.Fuck you. I got a broken heart here.Yeah I know...When you're right you're right Cleavon...No thanks.Lying there in all my misery, I had a moment of clarity. It became clear to me- I had to get to Phillip. No matter what. Even if it meant dying...Faking your death from AIDS is no easy task, believe me. But after watching Jimmy die, I thought I could make it convincing. First, you have to starve yourself- I ate half as much every day for ten months. After that, you have to fake all sorts of symptoms.You gotta keep this up for months until you lose about, say, 80 pounds.But the hardest part is falsifying your records.Hey Lawrence- you still work in the infirmary?You like coffee?How long do I have?But the hardest part by far is getting transferred to a private care facility. It's standard procedure for late stage patients, but convincing them I was about to die would involve taking a few risks.After a four day coma, they were convinced.This is Doctor Rios from the Hamblin Center, Houston. I'm looking for AIDS patients for a study we're... \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 110.And once I got settled in, I just called the Department of Corrections and convinced them I was a state-sponsored doctor looking for late stage AIDS patients for an experimental treatment. As luck would have it, they had one patient that was eligible...Oh you do? Steven Russell? Could you spell that?And for all that time- all those doctors, all those nurses and all those facilities... not one of them ever thought to give me an AIDS test...Fucking Texas...I had a special request when I ordered the cab. Did they tell you?Thank God.A week later, the hospice was to get a call from Doctor Rios, telling them Steven Russell had died undergoing treatment. And after all that hard work dying? Where's the first place I go?Funny, huh?I know- I'm sorry- You weren't supposed to find out.I couldn't take a chance telling you. You know that. I couldn't. But Phillip, I only did it so I could get here to you. Just to talk to you. And here I am. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\" Green Pages 5-23-08 112.I'm fine. Just hungry.Wait. Listen. I just came here to tell you one thing and that's it. You don't have to take me back, I just want to say one thing.I know you thought we were nothing but a lie- but underneath all those lies there was always something that was real. I thought about what you said to me. You said you don't know who I am. But I have to tell you- I know now. I know who I am. I mean- I'm not a lawyer, I'm not a CFO, I'm not a cop. Hell I'm not even an escape artist. Those Steven Russells are dead. And now, all that's left is the man that loves you. That's all. Nothing else. I'm just the man that loves you. And if you can see that... believe it... then I promise I'll never be anything else ever again.You don't.", "clean_line": "love sure funny thing makes happy makes sad makes sorts things thought love

Hundreds of millions of dollars pass through our system from the HMO's to the doctors. It's a critical business. A powerful business... So when I read your resume, I wasn't sure what to think.
