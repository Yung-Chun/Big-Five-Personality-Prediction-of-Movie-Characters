{"Kings-Speech-The": {"BERTIE": {"raw_line": "You look like a Christmas tree.Luh-luh-lords, la-la-ladies, gen-tell-men.No doubt you wish the Prince Of Wales was standing before you today.Be that as it may...my brother David is attending to other duties in the furthest parts of this vast Empire...Weren't they lucky.Can I be a penguin instead?Ah well.Once upon a time there were two horsies. A white horse that went clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park. And a black horse that went clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park. They met in the middle of Hyde Park. The white horse said \"neigh\". The black horse said, \"neigh\". The white horse continued on, clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park. The black horse continued on, clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park. And that's the end of the story. Now off to bed.David called. He said come round to The Fort on Friday and stay for dinner.I suppose.Seriously, she'll be there.About our coming?A married American? Twice divorced? He can't be.I d-d-don't thu-thu-think I c-c-can.Father, we're not a family, we're a firm.What did David say?Oh my brother... TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 16.What're you going to say?They didn't come to see us, Father.Where's David?What's needed is cooperation......buh-buh-between the cuh-cuh-classses...Is this necessary?David has `the touch'. They adore him.I'll wager they're saying: There's the useless one who can't speak.How'd you find this physician?I'm not sure I want to see this fellow.I'm not actually Mr ... TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 20.My wife's favorite colours.Please...You're too close. Five paces is the rule of thumb.I can't discuss that.That's better. When speaking with a Royal one waits for the Royal to start the conversation and chose the topic.I admit if one waits for me to start a conversation one can wait a rather long time.You call this making me comfortable?Aren't you interested in treating me? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 22.No thank you.Apparently a great deal of rudeness, Doctor Logue.I prefer Doctor.The Duke of York is appropriate.Your Royal Highness then.Prince Albert? Or Frederick? Arthur? George? I've lots of names to choose from.Only my family uses that.If we were equal I wouldn't be here, I'd be at home with my family and no-one would give a damn.My physicians say it's good for stuttering, relaxes the throat.They've all been knighted.I thought here we're \"equal\".I beg your pardon?I'm not here to discuss personal matters.Because I bloody well stutter! And you bloody well can't fix it!!!One of my numerous faults.Don't be ridiculous.I don't talk to myself!Stop calling me that!Then we shan't speak!Must I pay for this?Of course not!When I give a speech...I bloody stutter!!!Easy money. You're on.Royals don't carry money.If there is a next time.I certainly can't read The Bard.\"To be or not to be, That is the question. Whether it is wiser...\" There! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 26.I proved I can't read.You're playing music.How can I hear what I'm saying?!You're not well acquainted with Royal princes, are you?Rubbish.I was terrible. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 27.I know how I sound!I've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.I'm finished with Doctor Logue!The bloody man did parlour tricks and cheated me out of a shilling.Three days. Where've you been?So was I. Elizabeth has pneumonia. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 29.Father won't.Dying?!You believe that?May I remind you, you're not the one who's dying, Mother.Lord Wigram and Dr Dawson are making arrangements.They didn't say.Mother says you're late for supper.The look in mother's eyes, it was...ghastly.What's this bloody thing doing here?!The man was a total fraud!Would you like to hear?Well I think you should. You should know what goes on. Telling me he could help me read flawlessly. Lying bastard! Listen to this babble!Lionel...it's Bertie.Thank you. I didn't expect to be here. May I come in?What?Your wife?Myrtle? Myrtle's never met me. I've never met Myrtle. May we discuss Myrtle in private? Its not proper talking about our women on the street.What happened to your shoulder?What's your Myrtle got to do with me? Elizabeth doesn't much care for you either, but here I am.Which is why she dislikes you. You're far too familiar. May we discuss this properly?Another example of exactly the sort of thing you don't say to a Royal. And you're too close.Which is precisely why Elizabeth dislikes you.Oh I say, I'm terribly sorry. Tell your lads I'll buy a new one.What was he angry about?Thought he'd be proud of you.A man of stature?Oh. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 41.I was informed, after the fact, my father's last words were: \"Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together.\" Couldn't say that to my face. Your mother?Oh.I've been to Australia.My brother. That's why I'm here.Can't say.You must undersand, I can't puh-puh-puh...Pardon?\"Swanee River\". TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 42.Happens to be my favorite.Certainly not. May I help? Always wanted to build models. Father wouldn't allow it. I had to collect stamps. He collected stamps.I know the words! \"Way down upon the Swanee River. ...\" Etcetera.Of course I didn't stutter, I was singing! One doesn't stutter when one sings! ) Oh... Well I can't waltz around on State occasions warbling!That's because you're peculiar.No. Yes. Thank you. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 43.I'm not crooning to the tune of \"Swanee River!\"I can't talk, or sing, about your future King, doo-dah, doo-dah...Certainly not. I've always looked up to David. Water's boiling.I've a sweet tooth. To tell the truth......it was a relief. Knowing I wouldn't be King.I wouldn't have to give speeches!Eighteen months.We didn't think about it that way, doctor. Doo-dah doo-dah. David and I were very close.As brothers!Young bucks... You know.Upon occasion.What an extraordinarily rude thing to say! David did try to be her beau at one point. Before I met her. She wouldn't have him. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 45.Not like my father...he and his brother, when they were young, kept a girl in St John's Wood and shared her on alternate nights.They all did. \"Buh-buh-buh-Bertie\". Father encouraged it. \"Spit it out, boy!\" Thought it would make me stop. Is this necessary?!I mean the damn questions!You asked that before.Being born.December 14th.\"Mausoleum Day\". Prince Albert departed on that date. I was named Bertie to placate Great Grandmamma Victoria. In return, she hated me because it reminded her of her grief. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 46.Let's stick to medical history please. I'm naturally left handed, which was considered inappropriate.I was punished. Now I'm right handed.Bandy legs. Also considered inappropriate.Metal splints were made...worn night and day...very painful. Now I have straight legs. This is so...tawdry! I need your services as a Speech Therapist, not Grand Inquisitor. Are you available? Or will it be: \"Myrtle says no?\"Yes, I told you, I have a temper.He's fallen in love!With the wrong sort of woman!She's American.This one's divorced. Twice. Mrs Wallis Simpson of Baltimore. I want David to be happy, but the family, the Church, the nation, won't have it.If only! David used to prefer married women because there was no possible attachment. But now...Please.I made a smudge!You want me to beg for help?Don't say that!I brought it along. You won, fair and square. I'll pay you generously.That's what I was afraid of.You've someone waiting?I'd apologize to them in person, but...After the funeral...it may be even more difficult. To remain unobserved.Perhaps the wrong sort.You know, Lionel, you're the first ordinary Englishman......I've ever really talked to. Sometimes, when I ride through the streets and see a `bloke' I'm struck by how little I know of his life, and how little he knows of mine. Cuts both ways.She might. If I asked. Very nicely. And how will Myrtle take to our coming into your home?Pardon?Merely trying to overcome my dreadful impediment...Good lord no! I hope to...I'm not prepared!I...I...I thu-thu-think we should tuh-tuh- table the document.Wait down the road.I wasn't sure either. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 55.Do I look like a spy?I was totally unable to speak.Because you're paid to listen!What more does a man need,eh?Somebody has to live in them.I couldn't say anything!What a bloody stupid question! I just said one. Bloody. Bloodybloodybloody!Certainly not.Bugger!Well bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard!Shit then. Shit, shit, shit!Because I'm angry!Fornication?Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck!Bloody, bloody. bloody! Shit, shit, shit! Bugger, bugger, bugger! Fuck, fuck, fuck!This is your fault!Apologies, Mrs. Logue.Royals aren't allowed emotions in public.What do you want me to do, dammit!? Stage my next public appearance as an obscene operetta?!Don't take liberties! You're a dangerous man, Logue. Who sent you?The lurking shadows. Courtiers and peers...the whole panoply of a class which once ruled the nation which once ruled the world, afraid of losing their last vestige of privilege if the monarchy is further debased.Because, dear sweet deluded woman, she believes in me!I'm beginning to ask myself that very same question. Your sailing close to the edge, don't push me, Doctor Logue.I came here because I was taught from childhood to serve a purpose, and that purpose is to serve. Duty is our sole justification for privilege. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 59.I came here because I was under the illusion you might help me perform that function!He can bugger things up! And I am not the King. Mrs. Simpson is seeking a divorce. The Coronation is set for the 12th of May. Her decree becomes final on the 27th of April. That gives them two weeks to marry and put this issue to rest.That would be a tragedy. I pray to The Almighty they succeed. I'll do anything within my power to keep my brother on the throne.If necessary!Are you saying he wanted me to fail?Growing confidence? Growing dread!!! You're a wicked man, Lionel Logue, trying to get me to thrust myself forward as an alternative to my brother. Trying to get me to commit treason! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 60.How dare you! I'm the brother of a King...the son of a King...back through untold centuries. You presume to instruct me on my duty? A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback? The disappointing son of an embittered clerk! You're a monster, Doctor Logue. I'm going to Balmoral to spend a pleasant country weekend with my beloved brother. And these sessions are over!We must try to be pleasant.David...Been trying to see you...Doing what?Where did you get that American accent? David...Father's not dead six months, yet you've put Mrs. Simpson in the suite used by our mother?That isn't funny.Please. No more of that.This could end in disaster.Whatever will she call herself?David! The upper classes are terrified anything which clouds the monarchy makes their situation more dangerous. Hunger marchers are singing the \"Red Flag\" in front of Westminster...demanding a republic...I've seen them...Who'll sort out Chancellor Hitler? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 68.The man's a monster! Our position must remain clear.We are a German family!Because we took an English name! Windsor. Because we are England. We are the heart and soul of this nation. That must never change.I'm trying to warn you.David, your role is to consult and to be advised.Sounds like you haven't.He's your Prime Minister.If you refuse to listen to our Government, they have no choice but to resign.To fight a general election in which your marriage is the only topic?Privileges.No.We're not ordinary men, David! We were bred to be profiles on a coin. If you were ordinary, on what basis could you possibly claim to be King?!Don't say such a thing!I beg of you, don't do this to my wife, my daughters, to me. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 70.Don't dismount. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 72.Thought you were in David's camp?Good Lord! My brother wrote that?We're not coming to that?!Surely his motives are misunderstood?Winston?! Don't take him seriously! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 73.You're willing to go along with this?! Changing horses in mid-stream is a perilous maneuver!!!It's not too late, Winston, you could form a government on his behalf.I don't want to hear it! Ever!A giant.Where's the Austin?I liked the Austin.How did this happen to you? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 77.My Lords, members of the Accession Council, I meet you today in circumstances which are without parallel in the history of our Country...Daddy's home.I don't want to lose you.Being what we both dread most. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 78.That was lovely. Don't take any guff.I'd be honoured.Want me to beg?I believe this time a bit of begging might be required. Elizabeth says I must eat humble crow.I was frightened and took refuge in being `Royal'. What I said was unforgivable. And...What's the one essential thing a King must do? He must believe he is King. How can I possibly do that? For pity sake, Lionel, I beg you: get me through! I'll pay you another shilling.I wouldn't know.What do you suggest?What has my brother given up on his abdication, other than the throne?Wouldn't it be a good idea to find out before coming to me? He cannot be Mister, as he was born the son of a Duke. Which makes him a Lord at the very least.And as a Lord of the realm, he's entitled to be elected to the House of Commons. Heading a King's Party.So you prefer he takes a seat in the House of Lords? Again, on behalf of a King's Party? Is that acceptable?But if he's made a Royal Duke, and called His Royal Highness, he cannot stand for Parliament. Nor may he speak or vote in the House of Lords.The Duke of Windsor it is. Gentlemen.\"Let's go gathering hearty heather with the gay brigade of grand dragons.\"Those are my hardest sounds.Oh.How're they getting on?Do we remain in hiding?We're being cowards.You should go in.Why me?!Being a monarchist, I recognize these are your digs. Therefore: here you rule. Therefore: you go in.Full of hot air.Sorry, dear, doctor's orders. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa... She's right, those two chaps are staring at me....aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy... ...eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee... Are you timing this? iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii... ooooooooooooooooooooooooo... uuuuuuuuuuu.Is this the scene of the crime?Referring to my assault upon the ears of the listeners.Radio with pictures?!That'll keep you busy, removing all my stops and starts.What exactly do you mean?You mean my bodyguard,\"Crusher?\"Doctor Lionel Logue, my speech therapist.Dr. Logue is to be present at the Coronation.Behind the chair of Edward the Confessor.Which makes it most suitable.Two comfortable chairs. One for Madam Logue. She's a close friend of my wife. The Queen.Those are my wishes, Your Grace.You've made a dangerous enemy.And don't ever call me Bertie in public.I sense one of your dreadful questions on the horizon.Knew it! I haven't any choice.What's this, you wait til Westminster Abbey, then ambush me?I'm a sacrificial lamb being led to slaughter! Damn you! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 96.I WANT TO BE HEARD!George.Like my father.Given the current situation...too Germanic.This is not a rehearsal, \"Doctor\" Logue. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 99.\"Just call me Lionel\"! Never did you call yourself `Doctor'. We did that for you. No diploma, no training, no credentials. Just a great deal of nerve.There isn't a \"your-side-of-the-story\". This is my story. And you've ruined it! Its not just the Coronation, terrifying enough, its the radio speech to millions afterwards, and the speech after that, and for the rest of my failed miserable life!You dare remind me?!Then you knew from the start I was hopeless?!Lying bastard!In you?! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 100.Who the hell do you think you are?!Actor?An actor?!I know nothing of those poor men!I suppose that helped them, did it?Inquiries have been made! No credentials.To Harley Street?!So you set yourself up on Harley Street as an actor? Harley Street, don't you know, is for doctors!Well enough to deceive me.I would if I could!You've saddled this nation in its moment of peril with a voiceless King. Destroyed the happiness of my family...all for the sake of ensnaring a star client you knew you couldn't possibly assist!What're you doing? Get up! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 102.You can't sit there!It's the Chair of Edward The Confessor! The throne upon which every King for six and a half centuries has been crowned.That's the Stone of Scone! The Stone of Destiny that was once Jacob's pillow.Listen to me... !Divine right, if you must! I'm your King!!!Because I have a right to be heard!A man! I HAVE A VOICE!!! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 103.Stop trying to squirm off the hook.That won't be necessary.What did you say?Now I advise you, so listen carefully. ...in this personal matter I will make my own decision.And may I remind you, it is my head upon which the crown is placed! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 104.\"In this grave hour... \"\"In this grave hour... \" Sorry.\"In this grave hour... \"I say that all the time, but apparently no one's listening.Then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived. Lionel, I can't do this! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 106.If I am to be King...where is my power? May I form a Government on my own, appoint or dismiss a Prime Minister, chose an Ambassador, levy a tax or declare a war? None of these things. Yet I am the seat of all authority. Why? Because the Nation believes when I speak, I speak for them. Yet I cannot speak!\"In this grave hour, p-p-perhaps...\"The letter`P' is always difficult.\"In this grave hour...perhaps-the-most- fateful...in our history...\"\"... I send to every household of my peoples...both at home and overseas...\"\"...this message... \"\"...spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you... as if I were able...\"What?I prefer pipes.\"For the second time... in the lives of most of us... we are at war.\" One-two- three. \"Over and over again... we have tried to find a peaceful way... out of the differences... between ourselves... and those who are now our enemies.\" Bugger, bugger, bugger! Fuck, fuck, fuck!The shilling you won... still have it?I'll return it.`Walk up to the bloody thing boldly, stare it square in the eye, man to man.'I already know. My father taught me.Bugger bugger bugger...bloody bloody bloody...They'll bloody well have to listen to me anyway. Right? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 110.No matter how this turns out, I wish to thank you. For asking such dreadful questions. What can I do in recompense?Sorry. That would raise too many questions.Your shilling. Told you I'd give it back.No, you won this, fair and square.Made from the melted coin. Designed it myself, hope you like it, Lionel old friend. May I call you that?Oh dear.Almost.In this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history, I send to every household of my peoples, both at home and overseas......this message spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself. For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at war. For we are called, with our allies, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world. It is the principle which permits a State, in the selfish pursuit of power, to disregard its treaties and its solemn pledges; which sanctions the use of force, or threat of force, against the sovereignty and independence of other States. Such a principle, stripped of all disguise, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right, and if this principle were established throughout the world, the freedom of our own country and of the whole British Commonwealth of Nations would be in danger. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 113.For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, and of the world's order and peace, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge. It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own. I ask them to stand calm, firm, and united in this time of trial. The task will be hard. There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield. But we can only do the right as we see the right, and reverently commit our cause to God.If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, ready for whatever service or sacrifice it may demand, then, with God's help, we shall prevail.We may all find a message of encouragement in the lines which, in my closing words, I would like to say to you: `I said to the man who stood at the Gate of the Year, \"Give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown.\" And he replied, \"Go out into the darkness, and put your hand into the Hand of God. That shall be to you better than light, and safer than a known way.'\" May the Almighty Hand guide and uphold us all.", "clean_line": "look like christmas tree luh luh lords la la ladies gen tell men

Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths...\"What do you suggest?Not finished yet.Lionel!Bloody marvellous.Mr. Johnson, do come in.Glad we have something in common.My lads build them. Make yourself comfortable. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 21.What?That might be difficult in this office.Nice girl, Anna. Worried she wouldn't find a husband if she couldn't speak. Tried to convince her men will find her even more attractive as a silent partner. The perfect woman. Sorry, bad Australian joke. Why'd your wife change her mind and ask for an appointment?What can we talk about?Your joking. That won't work here.You call this being forthcoming?Only if you're interested in being cured.Cuppa tea?I need one.Any idea what you're letting yourself in for?Call me Lionel.I prefer Lionel. My family calls me far worse. What shall I call you?Oh please.Much more informal.How about Bertie? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 23.That's what I'll call you then. We must be true equals.Don't do that.Sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.They're idiots.Makes it official then. House rules: no smoking.As a monarchist I thought you'd appreciate these are my digs and here I rule. No smoking. What was your earliest memory?First recollection of the world? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 24.Why're you here then?Temper.Do you stutter when you think?One of my many faults. How about when you talk to yourself?Come on, everyone natters to themselves once in a while, Bertie.Shan't call you anything else.Loads. Now: when you talk to yourself, do you stutter? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 25.Proving your impediment isn't a permanent internal fixture.Bet you a bob you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.See your shilling then.How convenient.I'll stake you. Pay me back next time.Correct, I haven't agreed to take you on.`Easy money'.Not so fast.You proved you can't listen.A princely bob is at stake.I'm aware.Bertie, you're Royal. Surely a prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?I want to demonstrate that when you can't hear your voice, you don't stutter, thus proving your impediment is not innate.Flawless.Would I lie to a prince of the realm to win twelve-pence?Souvenir of our first and presumably last encounter.I'm finished with your husband.Lionel.Certainly not. How's it going, mate?Willie? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 28.Why am I not surprised?Mmmm?You sure?\"Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises, Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not. Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments Will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices, That, if then I had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming, The clouds methought would open, and show riches Ready to drop upon me; that, when I waked, I cried to dream again.\"Must be a tradesman. Off you go, lads. Mum should be home from work.My condolences. I didn't expect you.No.My wife doesn't think it's a good idea.Myrtle. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 39.Sore back.That woman has style.You look dreadful.But you're not Royal in this room. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 40.Not there!Curtis bi-plane, now a Curtis mono-wing.You don't have any money. I'll fix it. So, Bertie, what brings you here? Your father's death?Mine lay rigid, fists clenched angrily at his sides, daring the Reaper: take me, you bastard!I was a great disappointment.So did I.A clerk.Coughed herself to death when I was young.I remember going to the theatre with her. Not real theatre...traveling players.Not where I lived.What's he done?I'm going home now.Try singing it.Know any songs?Very modern.Sing it.Only if you sing. Goes like this... \"Way down upon the...\"You didn't stutter.You can with me.I take that as a compliment. Cut some struts from the balsa. Sorry, hard to show you what to do at five paces. Would you like a cup of tea?You were about to sing an aria concerning your brother.Try \"Camptown Races\" then. \"The Arch of C, he said to me, doo-dah doo- dah...\" That sort of thing.My future King? He's your future King too. Did that cause friction? Knowing he'd grow up to be King, but you wouldn't.Two lumps or one?Always preferable. Cover it with tissue.Why's that?No smoking. What's the age difference?But for eighteen months you would've been King?!As you said: eighteen months.How close?I don't, or I wouldn't ask. Did you go after the same girls?Princess Elizabeth?Now dope the other wing. Did David tease you?Otherwise the paint will eat through the tissue.Mandatory. Tell me more about your storybook childhood. What was your earliest memory?This time I'd like an answer.How can you remember that?I don't understand.And?Anything else?You sound angry.Angry at me, or at your brother?How dreadful.What's wrong with her?Some of them must be lovable. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 47.Can't they fornicate privately like adults?\"Queen Wallis of Baltimore\"?Does sound a bit iffy.Touch it up.I advise you never to beg. Especially if you might be King.I see. For reasons you cannot disclose, fearing ramifications you will not explain, you feel sufficiently anxious to embark upon a course of therapy in which you have no faith? You already owe me a shilling.I'll continue to ask questions.Nice job.I do now.You don't wish to be seen? Slip out the back way.You're having second thoughts.I ask too many questions?We live in South Kensington, small apartment, but no one would see you. Lots of planes.Australian. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 49.And if you decide to come, bring the Duchess. She might be helpful.Not sure. She isn't speaking to me. Wants to go home. After the funeral then?How're you doing, Willie?Willie?Well done.To be honest, wasn't sure whether to expect you.Something happened?With a toothache.You seldom stutter with me anymore. The boys are a bit untidy.Like a verbal geisha girl?Home.Coming from a man who's lived all his life in castles and palaces. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 56.Somebody does.You could've refused. Don't you know any rude words?Perhaps a touch more vulgar?To prove you know how.A public school prig could do better.Hardly robust.See how defecation flows trippingly from the tongue? You don't stutter when you swear. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 57.Get angry more often. Do you know the f- word?Oh Bertie...Bravissimo! Now a resounding chorus of...Sorry, pet! Won't happen again!First time I've heard you laugh.Which explains a lot.Your next public appearance should be very well rehearsed.Anyone in mind?Your wife was the one who sought me out.But you don't share her belief? Why come here?Lionel.Not to worry. They say the King can do no wrong.And if Mr Baldwin stops them?Does that include debasing yourself?Your brother knew perfectly well by giving you a document without warning...Are you insisting he didn't? In the future we can parse any document into manageable phrases. You can sing them, swear them, rehearse them til you get the rhythm and flow; that, combined with your growing confidence...Trying to get you to realize you need not be governed by fear. Again, why did you seek me out? To take polite elocution lessons so you could attend posh tea parties?!Now?Outer Mongolia?Nothing prevents.Australia.Caliban?Of course. \"Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises, Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.\"\"Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments Will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices...\"You may leave.First class.Willie's a problem...not much progress. The others have been referred.Try not to act the toff. Teach perhaps.No! I'm not good enough!Yes, I had a go. Thanks to your patience. I just bloody well wasn't good enough!I too \"married the woman I love.\" TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 75.A wonderful lass. Someone I can talk to heart to heart.That's why we're suited. I'm just an ordinary bloke.Me too.That relationship is now past tense.I wanted to be a great actor. That's what I wanted.I certainly failed!Very snugly, into my heart! Always have, always will. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 76.We haven't much more time together. Give it a go.There weren't any more appointments today.Piss off! Anna?Read it to him. If he doesn't profess his love, he's not a man.Johnson, isn't it? Have you an appointment?I told you, Kings don't beg.Its \"crow\" or \"humble pie\". Take your pick. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 80.And?What're friends for?Splendid. Here's another. \"She sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through strong thick sieves.\" At home, twenty-five times, in rapid succession.Shall we invite your wife in now? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 83.I wasn't expecting Myrtle for several hours!As to be expected.I'm not going out there!Of course. We're sensible men.Me? You.You're the Royal.Oh! Hello, Lady Elizabeth! Oh! Hello, Myrtle darling! What a pleasant surprise.Some other time, love.Glad you had a chance to meet Myrtle.Good of you to come.For me to show you how to pitch in.Piece of cake. Please assume a supine position on the floor.Firm support is needed. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 86.Breathe deeply...expand your chest... now your stomach...deep into the diaphragm. Splendid. How do you feel?Well on your way to becoming a qualified political speaker. Again...... and hold. Now, Princess Elizabeth, be so kind as to sit on your husband's stomach.Gently of course.Now exhale slowly...down goes Princess Elizabeth...inhale slowly...nothing rushed, expanding your chest fully, extending the column of air til it hits the diaphragm...and...up comes Princess Elizabeth. Exhale...down goes Princess Elizabeth...inhale...up comes Princess Elizabeth. You get the idea. Doesn't have to be Princess Elizabeth of course, but I thought you'd prefer your wife to one of the staff. Now comes the fun part.You will now shout the vowel sounds, all five of them, as loudly as possible, each to last no less than 15 seconds. There's poor coordination between your larynx and diaphragm. Princess Elizabeth, you can be the official timer.Anyone who can stand at an open window vibrating loudly in full view of the world can learn to give a public speech.You're followed?No.We're not fighting. Your mother isn't talking.Boys, leave.A Duchess, she hasn't been crowned yet.What'd you think of her?Why'd you come home so early?They came for help. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 89.When that poor chap first walked into my office, he was a slim, quiet man with tired eyes and all the outward symptoms of the person upon whom a habitual speech defect has set the sign. You saw him today; once more there was hope.Myrtle, I love you.Myrtle... I don't deserve a wonderful woman like you.But why'd you come home so early?Why?!Oh, Myrtle. My love...A King based upon deception?Why not paint him pink and cover him with sequins?If you wish to call attention to his anxiety.Just Lionel.And now, if you don't mind, we need the premises.So must Bertie.I do. During waking hours we'll need the facilities. It'll be a closed set. No observers.Wouldn't want him as a friend.Tell me...Do you really want to be King?You can be a wounded King who stumbles through his Coronation. Or, as the Arch of C so archly suggests, no Coronation at all. Always a choice.I'm simply asking questions... which you seem unable to answer.Quite possibly. But at least I know what I want. You haven't the foggiest.That's quite different. Let's get down to work then, shall we?As soon as you and Elizabeth enter the West door, you'll be greeted with the hymn \"I Was Glad When They Said Unto Me.\" You won't actually be that glad, because they sing it for a great long time.You'll then show yourself to the various sides of the Abbey as the Archbishop announces four times in a loud voice, \"Sirs, I here present unto you...\" Have you decided your name for when you become King? For when you become a different person?Like your father?Not Albert?\"Sirs, I here present unto you, GEORGE, your undoubted King!\" TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 97.Mmm... Kedgeree! Lovely.I've news for you. You're coming to the Coronation.You must.Royal Box. You and I.Rather thought you might.Won't be a sec.Bertie? Blast! Stepped on Lord Byron. Bertie...?Ah, the Star Chamber inquisition. I wondered when that would happen. And I'd promised Myrtle a new frock.Want to hear my side of the story?Wembley Stadium...I was there.My son, Valentine, asked, \"Could you help that poor man?\" I replied, \"He's too old for me to manage a complete cure, but I could very nearly do it, I'm sure of that.\"I knew I could help you. You refuse to believe?In yourself.A failed actor.Father wanted me to be a doctor, but I couldn't cut flesh. So I worked in the mines, recited in pubs...When the war came, by the time I was ready to be shipped out, the first casualties were limping home. Poor buggers, broken in bone and spirit. `Lionel, you're good with your mouth, see if you can help these poor sods.' The shell-shocked were the saddest. Most stuttered profoundly. Far worse than you. Muscle therapy helped somewhat, but I found I had to go deeper, as you might well imagine.I think you do. They had cried out, and the universe had not listened. So they'd lost faith in their voice. My job was to make them shout in righteous anger: \"I have the right to be heard!\"Make inquiries.But a lot of success. No training was given. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 101.Not in Western Australia, not at that time. I simply knew what to do. When the war was over I kept being a therapist to earn a living. When the lads were old enough, I thought, \"Alright Lionel, you've always wanted to be an actor, one last go.\" I pretended it was our trip home to Mother England, the Great Australian Pilgrimage.Cashed in our return tickets. I had three months rent.The plaque says, `L. Logue. Speech Specialist'. No mention of a medical degree. No mention of any degree. Some of the diggers I'd helped had come to England. They made referrals. My practice flourished. My acting, however, did not.Lock me in the Tower.What crime?I'm tired.Why not? It's a chair.It's falling apart. People have carved their initials into it. Needs a stone to keep from blowing away.You believe such ballocks I don't care how many royal backsides have sat on it, it's a building block with handles attached. You're just like me, an actor with tawdry stage props you choose to believe are real.Listen to you?! By what right?Noooo you're not! Told me so yourself. Said you didn't want it. So why should I listen to a poor stuttering bloke who can't put one word after another? Why waste my time listening to you?Heard as what?!Well then...you're cured.Bertie, you'll make a bloody good king. And you know it.In hushed tones the BBC commentator paints a picture for the world, as you stand at the altar divested of your robes. Trumpets echo through the Abbey. The incessant rain clears miraculously as a shaft of sun streams through the stained-glass window catching your golden tunic and bathing you in light like a mediaeval knight. And you are King!Try again.Turn the halts into pauses, during which you say to yourself, \"God save the King\".Use the silence. Long pauses add solemnity to great occasions.Take it from the top. \"In this grave hour...\"Go on...Get a running start, put the words all together. `Perhaps-the-most-fateful...'Beaut.Doo-dah, doo-dah.Five miles long... TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 107.In your head, now: \"Bugger, bugger, bugger! Damn, damn, damn! All those bloody blighters are going to have to listen to me!\" Can you dance?Helps relax the body. Waltz?Thought you might. Dance with me. One, two, one-two-three- four. One, two, one- two-three-four. \"For the second time...\" one-two-three-four \"... in the lives of most of us...\" one, two, one-two-three- four \"... we are at war.\" Three, four.You'll be ready.Of course. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 108.Willie! Where's your mum?You've been waiting here, alone, all this time?Did you?He did.Would you like to sing, dance, and shout rude words?Why am I not surprised?You're going to be splendid. And if you're not?Bloody right.I've always wanted to be knighted.Understood.Keep it for good luck.My greatest honour, Bertie. One final question.Do you believe you're King?I always called you Bertie.
