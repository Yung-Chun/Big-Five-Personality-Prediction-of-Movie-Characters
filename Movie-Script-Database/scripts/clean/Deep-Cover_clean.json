{"Deep-Cover": {"CARVER": {"raw_line": "Officer Leland? You know the difference between a black man and nigger?Yeah, most niggers don't.Nice to meet you.So, Winston, what's the difference between a black man and a nigger?Thanks for coming in.Gerald Carver, United States District Attorney. Call me Gerry.You can tell he's a cop?Then why's he taking him to the room?Charles Taft. LAPD Narcotics.He's a great cop. Two [names citation] and a [another citation]. As tough as they come and twice as honest.You are. If you want to be. Most undercover guys don't know what they're doing because it's a day gig. I need somebody who goes under and stays there; six months, a year, five years...Buy drugs. Sell drugs. Feed me information.He's a drug dealer. A criminal. A scumbag. But for the right side. I want you to come to Los Angeles on loan to the Justice Department as a federal agent. Your experience there will be credited toward your seniority here. And you'll come back to Cleveland a P3 or higher.You're separated from your wife, she's filled for divorce. You see your kids every other weekend.Come on, a little grass...?What's to understand? You saw your father killed when you were ten, and you decided you wouldn't be like that. I'm God, I know everything. You wanted to be a good boy, so you became a cop. Hiding out in uniform... That's why you got the hard-on for Taft.I'll tell the truth, Joe. You're never going to be a Taft.You ever take a look at your psychological profile? You score almost like a criminal. \"Resents authority...\"\"...Exaggerated moral standards, but with no underlying value system.\" Look at the anger, the repressed violence, it's almost off the scale...Why'd you join the force?Well, now you can be. You won't be Taft, but maybe you'll be something more... interesting. There's a man named Ramon Gallegos who supplies 60% of the cocaine to the West Coast. He's smart, smooth, and sufficiently elusive that we don't even have an adult photograph of him. However, his uncle is Hector Guzman, an important Latin American political figure. Gallegos uses Uncle's connections to get product into the country, and everyone we've sent after him has ended up like that...You already are, that's the point... You've got the ability and the personality to go underground and blend in completely. That's what the others couldn't. Some part of them showed. That's why they're dead. See, there's only one rule in this game.Don't blow your cover.Barbosa, Felix.Get to Elias. Then to Barbosa.Rush it, please. I want art, John, not reality. Budget hearings start in April, and I need Gallegos by then. They won't give us funding for three ounce buys.Without funding, we aren't doing it at all.I can't buy this much shit. I haven't got it in the budget.You're a drug dealer, John. Deal drugs.Don't blow your Carver.You're still thinking like a cop, John. Forget that. Cross the line. Be what you are. You're a criminal. You don't give a shit about other people. You're just trying to survive.But you want to be of use. You want to get drugs off the street, don't you?Well, this is the cost. Pay it or go grow flowers someplace.Synthetic shit?? Sounds like a 20/20 segment...So, what was it like?Popping Ivy...I'm God, remember?You didn't clear it with me. You're getting independent. That's good.How're we coming on Gallegos?Then you've got to --I want you to get a new apartment. Something expensive.That shithole? You're big time now. Act it. And get some clothes. Spend money. Have fun. That's an order.You run Elias.My problem? My problem is that you don't really know what's happening.Barbosa is setting you up tonight.He's dealing you to Taft and Hernandez. You're going to be taken down as you receive the drugs. They're putting together the arrest team right now.You stay away. We're going to take them down.My boss wants a bust right now. He goes before the oversight committee next week. He needs something to justify the budget.Too late. The whole thing's set up.It's out of my hands.John, don't go near that bust.Get in.Where the hell have you been?You violated a direct order to stay away from that bust. As a result, a police informant is dead, a state senator was critically injured in the tunnel pile up and a city policeman was subsequently murdered.Don't get smart with me, motherfucker.Never have, never will. I want you to give me your gun. You're coming in right now.Your assignment has been terminated. You're not going out there again. If I have to, I'll put you in custody.You violated orders, so you're through. Don't make a conspiracy theory out of it.You're insane.All right!It's the State Department.I told you, Gallegos's uncle is a big deal down there.Guzman, right. Our government supports Guzman because he's a moderate. That's a right-winger who's pro-U.S. If Gallegos got busted here, it would hurt Guzman's political career there. It's politics, John, not drugs.I'm going to Washington, John. I'll bring you with me. We'll have clout, money...We tried.But you can't do that, John. It's not you.It's not that simple.Don't blow your cover.He vanished, thank God, or we'd both be in deep doo-doo. At least you got Gallegos.That's the drug game. Plus a change... I want you to come back to work for me. You'll beat all charges on a technicality and go back to who you were.Does anyone really know?Like travel? Tangiers, maybe?I'm God, remember?Go back to work, she walks out of here. Otherwise, she's up on multiple counts, and I'll see to it the judge runs them consecutively.Betty walked out of court free this morning. That's my side of the deal.Her probation gets revoked the minute you fuck up.

And now...?Then what are we doing here?Because they can't bear reality.What's next?Why aren't you selling it?Who are the big guys?Why can't you get to them?Sounds like a dream.Tell me about this new shit.Hi, Miranda.That's more than I bought.You're having trouble moving it.Make me your partner. I'll help you get your capital.What am I supposed to do with it?You know how this goes, Gerry. It won't stop here. You know what they're going to ask me to do pretty soon, to prove I'm down. What am I supposed to do then?I can't do this shit. I just can't.That's why I'm here.You can't back down with them. You've got to project strength, from inside, you know?Cocksucker...'Cause I can, motherfucker, 'cause I can....Touch her again, motherfuckers, I'm gonna mess you up.Is David Elias here?'Cause you're a racist asshole. You feel like you're fucking a slave, and it gets you off.I don't dig white women. Even if I did, it wouldn't mean the same thing.Fuck Hegel. Who the fuck is Hegel? Some smart-ass kike that talks backwards?Does your wife dig black guys, David? Did she fuck Eddie? Does she want to fuck me?You think what impresses her now is your dick?So how's this place work?How much is this?I'll take it.No, thanks.Never have, never will.Watch your mouth, David.Don't call me a spade. And don't tell me to play black.Say it again, and I'll kill you.You gotta pay anyway.Shit...Bijoux!!She worked for me. I'm supposed to protect her.That guy who works for Barbosa can do it, Chino.Right.Don't blow your cover.If I do this, we're partners. Equal partners on everything.Let's go.Go wait around back....Carmen, it's me. It's Daddy...Hi, baby. How are you? I miss you!I miss you...What does this shit do to you?I don't take drugs.What was what like?You knew.Then you should know how it was.He supplies Barbosa. To get to him we'll have to take quantity.That's what killing Ivy did. I'll get to him soon.Is that it?I like where I am.Whether I'm here or not, no one else uses that room. And change the linen twice a week, just like now. And make sure James gets what he needs. And something for you.Hey...!A Jewish lady in the store helped me.Fifty bucks, fifty fucking bucks...Order ten.Better twenty.I do. We've got a bigger territory, we need more product. I want to deal directly with Gallegos. It would save us money.If we buy twenty, Gallegos'll come to us himself.When I bought a key from Eddie, you came to me.Who's above Gallegos?How else will I learn? Call Barbosa, David, put in our order... Because we have to split this, and there isn't enough here for both of us.How do I look at you?I don't think I'm better than you. I don't think I'm better than anybody.But I do know something... You can't stop thinking about me.I don't do that.It's for fuck-ups.More.Not ten... twenty.The more we have, the more we can move. There're markets we can't open because we don't have the inventory.I'm with David.Don't waste your time.Okay, that's it. Get away.Why did you do it?We're getting twenty kilograms tomorrow. Tonight. I made it happen. I pushed Elias, now he doesn't make a move without me.I control him. Barbosa's selling it to us because he thinks I can move it... And last night I met Ramon Gallegos.We're getting the dope from him; it's still coming through Barbosa, but Gallegos will approach me soon on his own. We're going to get him, Gerry. We're going to bring him and the whole thing down.What's your problem?Oh, so, tell me what's happening, Gerry.Bullshit.What do we do?Who? Elias and Betty? Don't be silly.I'll get him something. Give me ten days, and I'll get him Gallegos on a plate.Gerry, what are you telling me? I need Elias... and Betty. You arrest them, and you're throwing away everything I've set up.We shouldn't go to them. Maybe them come to us.Let's see what we've got.Don't touch it.Something's wrong. What's that van doing there?This is a bust. The minute we take the stuff, they'll be over us.Chino, pick up the suitcase and give it to Elias. I'll only kill him if something goes wrong.Okay, everybody in the car.Relax. We'll make it.If I was cop, you'd be face down back there.The whole thing smelled. Changing his mind about the stuff. Meeting us way out here. And I'd seen cops in that van before. Hernandez is dirty, that's who he's using.David, not now.Stop it, David, or we're...Goddammit!You want to kill a cop?? Don't be stupid.No! She's with me. She's not going to talk. You touch her, I'll kill you.They're going to come after us.Tell me about you.Don't hurt her.Who did Barbosa collect from?He'll tell us. Gopher, just...Where the hell is all the money? We're still a million short.David, we've got thirty-six hours.Sooner than that.What are you doing here? You're going to get me killed.Doing my job.I didn't blow my cover.Don't be a shmuck, Gerry. I'm talking to Gallegos. I'm collecting his money. We can set him up right now.Coming in where?I'm going to have Gallegos in two days.You're protecting him. You're protecting Gallegos.No, of course. That's why you wanted to bust Elias and Betty. I was getting close, and you wanted to cut this off then... What is he, the new Noriega? Helps you fight commies, so you let him sell drugs to the niggers. Two birds with one stone.I'm through...? Then, I might as well have a drink after all.Now tell me the truth or they're going to decide your troubles got the best of you.All the more reason to do what I say. Jesus, Ger, I'm having trouble holding on...Say it!Guzman.Drugs is politics. Politics is drugs... Christ, Gerry, I dealt drugs. I killed a man. Others died. What did I do all this for? For nothing.I didn't do this for clout or money. You said we were gonna do some good.Trying's for college boys. If all there is is power and money... If all there is... then what am I doing here? 'Cause I can get more power and money out on the street, I got more there already, than I'd ever get kissing your ass in Washington...Me? There is no me. We took care of that. First I was a cop pretending to be a dealer. Now I'm just a dealer pretending to be a cop. Why not stop pretending...? Quit the force. Be a dealer.My assignment's already terminated. All I have to do is quit. I hereby quit. My first one. Not so bad.Who are you, my mother?Tell you what?What did I come to say?When I was young, I occasionally stole things. My father died when I was ten. Right in front of me.Heart attack. He just fell down. He said, \"I love you,\" then died in my arms.You're not doing the stuff anymore, are you?How is that?Things are getting, they're getting a little... confusing. I had certain plans, and people haven't come through exactly as they promised.It's not just those people. It's... it's bigger than that. It's of everybody. Present company excluded.I can't.No! This is what I'm supposed to do.The whole fuckin' world. You think I didn't try something else? But everything funnels you right back here. Like it's where you had to go all along.If I tried to get out now, they'd kill me.There've got to be more. We have a million two, we owe Gallegos one eight.What are you laughing at?It isn't one eight. It's a million one. That's all Barbosa owed, it's all we're paying.No!Jesus Christ...What's going on here, David?You're doing too much stuff.What the fuck's the matter with you?Jesus...Yes. I can't believe you got us into this. All of fucking Latin America is going to be after our asses, including Renaldo Guzman who's friends with fucking George Bush.They're going to get your family, David. They'll kill your wife and daughter.You knew about this then?What about Betty?You can't go back.Give me that.Look, Mr. Taft, that's your name, right? Leave me alone. I got things on my mind.And what do you do, Mr. Taft, except chase bad guys up and down the street with your dirty partner, never catching anybody important?Get out of my room.They're my children. They live in Cleveland with their mother. I'm divorced from her. I haven't seen them in... some time. I want to, but I haven't been able to arrange it.Everything else... Everything else is... I don't know.Do it.Money? I got money...International terminal. I'll meet you there in a week.You wouldn't even look at me.No, I wasn't, I was...What if we forget all this? Take ten million each and disappear. Leave the country. New identities, new lives...Yeah.They're after us, not you.Oh, Jesus, no...He's dying.[Says to Taft whatever a CPR-trained policeman would say in this situation.] Get help.Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a fucking cop...I don't have one. I'm undercover. Get help, David.He didn't know.Drop the gun, put your hands against the car. Spread your legs... Police!My God! Please...What about Guzman?Elias did. And everything goes on as before.Who was I, Ger?I have other things to do.You have to. It's all set up. That's how you're getting off.My father didn't have a heart attack.He was shot robbing a liquor store. Trying to rob it. I lied about that.I had to start somewhere...

It'll be Barbosa's territory. It's gotta be us.And if it's us, it's gotta be you.What?Now...?I want to see you in that alley.Randy's a genius. His professor told him he could win the Nobel prize.What would it take to manufacture this stuff in quantity?I'm going to put two hundred fifty thousand into your corporate account. You cheat me, Randy, I'll use your bladder for a bagpipe. We're going to put Barbosa out of business.Nice place. Nice suit.You pick all this shit out yourself?Aw... Very nice. Understated. I'm impressed.You sold it all?I'll order a couple more keys from Barbosa.Ten??I don't want to push it.Barbosa'll never let us near him.How do you know?Guzman, but he's... Don't ask so many questions.Having fun? I talked to Barbosa. He'll see us now.Go fuck yourself.Don't talk to me that way.Any time, any place.This? What is this?One more.That was two.One more.One more! We're not finished! Four was the match.Look at me. Look at me, damn it!I needed it. They taught me what I needed to know.

I'm a shmuck...He wouldn't.Fucking A, John...Get out of the car.Yes, now!He traded us to the cops. Just like Eddie. Eddie, who was nice to my daughter, had to die because that's the rule. And you were vulgar about my wife, Felix, so at the very least the same rule applies to you.I want you to get out of the car. Get out of the fucking car. Out of the fucking --Look at my hands!Get out of the car.Stay out of this, or you'll die. You'll both die. Everyone'll die.I had him!Everything is different. We're the Colombians now. This is the greatest night of my life. Terrible but great. Felix was right...He said I should kill a man. He was right.Barbosa was a roach. Do you miss him? Will anybody in the world miss him?Yes. Thank God.She knows too much. We have to kill her.She's your responsibility then.We're going to get the money now, John. Enough for the new drug. We're going to be rich. We're going to be so rich that we're going to leave the world of ordinary people and going to a higher realm. I mean that.It's a hardball game. We're hardball players.Who's grave?Listen, you fucking monkey, you know who owed him money, and we know you know. Tell us or --I gotta get laid.Pick me up at Jacqueline's in the morning.What's that?And we're happy. Everybody's happy. It's a happy world.We want Barbosa's business.And, also, your business. All this. Your money, your dope, everything.How tough is enough?Thank you, John. I couldn't have done that without you.You taught me to take my work seriously.We're taking over.No, I'm very clear. I'm very, very clear. Ahora, usted nos assistamos. Enteindo?Donde esta?It works, John. It works.Disce a Senor Guzman que... ...that we have his money, and we're willing to talk as soon as he comes to town. We'll know how to reach him.
