I got Calabrese right in my gunsights.If I had a Sidewinder missile, I could save the taxpayers a lot of money.Here he goes. I'm shutting down the radio, partner.Let's go, boys. I'm missing the Oscars.I know you, Calabrese. But who are these mystery guests?Who are you? Get out of those shadows --A quarter's a quarter.This doesn't go out over the air, pal. For your ears only.Calabrese. I just got his ass -- on candid camera.Him and his gorilla Vitale. I got film and audio on both of them, laying out a hit. Two other guys I couldn't make out, but I'm sure they'll come up on the film. This is a big one, Carlito. Our own academy award. You ready?I want you to track down Morgensteen right now. If he's with that meter maid from Pico, crank her legs apart and pry him out of there.Screw his happiness. Tell him I want the lab open at six-thirty tomorrow morning. I want this film pushed to the max, and nobody but us to know about it. I know we got something here.I promised my kid I'd be home. I'll be at the lab before dawn.How ya doing? Got any champagne?You're not watching the Oscars?You got a phone back there?Punch nine-one-one.We ... ell ... there's only three of you and you only got one shot left.I know what you're thinking. I have this big shotgun and all you have is that little icepick. Mine's bigger than yours. It's not fair.Still not fair?Don't wait for the blindfold, maricon.I just got these new glazer bullets. You know they're almost a buck a pop now?I know that voice.Wish I could sleep like that.You faker.Who won?Candy?You know why E.T. lost?Cause they only let grownups vote. If kids had voted --We would have given him everything.You know the rules. One joke a day. I have to make 'em last.It's okay. It's not mine.Maybe you should be.A couple of things crossed my mind, in the car coming home.-- Nurse ...Miss ... please ... they won't tell me ... think I'm too disorient --Seven... years?Who ... who knows I'm awake?Listen to me carefully -- -- Andy. I don't have the strength to talk much. I'm a cop. My wife ... family ... murdered. That's how I got here. If you don't get me out ... you and I ... good chance ... both be dead.Goddamit -- can't stay here. Listen to me -No --Sonofabitch!-- Help me ...Seven years.Geraldo?Yeah, that Esposito. The ignorant fuck who's broadcasting the news right now. Tell him it's Storm. Mason Storm.I can't stay here. They'll trace you from the hospital in two --Esposito? Listen, you sonofabitch --Listen. I'm getting out of here.I just need some food -- and a few days to get my strength.You helped me, okay? I'm grateful. But every day you keep helping puts you in more danger.I've been dead, Andy. You wouldn't like it.You're the one who doesn't get the picture.First of all, I ain't no fucking invalid! And second, I don't have time --Just some herbs I need for my recovery.That bad ... huh?I slept for seven years?What's this reading? 555 over four digits --I'll tell you what it is. It's a phone number.Thanks.Please.I'm sorry -- Sorry. I --Why am I still in this fucking cage?! What's wrong with my body? Why won't it heal faster?!!Don't say that!Because I can't love you! Don't you see? It's seven years to anyone else. But it's only days for me.How can I be with you ... how can I want you and take you, when --You seduced me. You came in here, looking that way, knowing just what the hell you were doing --You have no right to want me!Who asked you to? Not me!Then don't risk it! Don't do shit for me! I don't need you!O'Malley.Where is he now? Is he safe?Then that was your mother. The one Andy found.O'Mal ... I can never thank you.I'd give my left arm to see Sonny, just for two minutes. But we can't risk it -- not yet. Not till I get Calabrese.He did his thing -- then they waxed him.The two guys at the pier. They ordered the hit on me too. And I've got 'em on film. Still in the camera, right where I left it.Where is the tape?What happened, O'Mal? To you?I'm sorry, O'Mal.You did the right thing, O'Mal.We'll get 'em, buddy. Every fucking one of them.Get Sonny out of that school, O'Mal. Right now. With me alive and making a stink, whoever's on that film is going to be looking harder than ever for Sonny -- just to get to me. Get him someplace safe ... three thousand miles away if you have to.I'm going straight to get that film. When you've got Sonny safe, bring me the audiotape. We'll put 'em together and get 'em to Esposito for the T.V. news. That should be quite a show.Gone. For the best. For her best.I'm gonna take you to the bank, Senator Trent. The blood bank.I won't let you.O'Malley was here.You found him. The old lady was his mother. And Andy ... my son's alive.I know this fuck. He's a cop!Holland! The other man on the dock --We just made the top of the chart, Andy. Every cop in the city thinks we shot our way out of a legitimate bust --Only 'cause they're too stupid. We need that film and we don't need any bullshit --New wall ... fucking yuppies!Better have this place fumigated -- quick.O'Malley left his mother's place three hours ago -- with the tape. He should be at the school by now, but she hasn't heard back from him.Mrs. O'Malley. Sorry ... listen. We're outside the Century Plaza now ... the hotel. Right, right. The one in Century City. Okay, listen closely ... Tell O'Mal to leave a message for us at the hotel desk. Leave it for Andy ... Andrea Smith. We're not gonna check in, it's too dangerous -- but the desk will hold the message if you tell them we're coming in this afternoon. Got it? Great. You're a champ, Mrs. '0.'You're gonna call Esposito. But not from this phone.Hey, hermano! You want this Jeep?Fuckin' smoking.He'll be there.Try O'Malley one more time. If you hear any lions roaring, haul ass.Don't worry. I'm a big boy.I haven't got the film on me.Still in the camera.You know, Trent ... I could rip your fucking throat out before that sonofabitch over there could find the spit to sneeze.Very well placed, Trent. But did you know that human reaction time -- even the fastest -- is between half and three-quarters of second? And in that time, I could easily --You think I care, motherfucker? Just so I get you -- one way or the other.Just tell me one thing. Who pulled the trigger on me and my wife?How's the action, boys? Mind if I play?I know what you guys are thinking. You're thinking I couldn't play with this gun in my hand. Right?Well? Somebody hand me a cue.That's for my wife. Fuck you and die.How does it feel to know you're about to die?I'll give you more time than you and Trent gave my wife.Vernon, oh, Verrrrrnon, where are you?Let's see ... where could that bad boy be?You know, Trent, I want to kill you so bad I can barely contain myself. But I keep thinking that death is far too merciful a fate for you, and that a nice petite white-bread boy like you in a federal penitentiary ... -- let me put it this way -- I doubt whether you could remain anal retentive for very long. Yeah... I think that's best for you --Knock, knock.Boo.You don't have to cry about it.

I'd like to speak with Captain O'Malley.I have a John Doe coma patient, code access 461 zebra, with instructions to notify upon any change in condition.The patient has regained consciousness.This is U.C.I. Medical Center. You've been in a coma. Your charts go back for seven years.It's all over the hospital. You're the first one that's come out of a coma of this duration. You'll probably be on the news! You'll be famous!Please -- you're in no danger here.I'll have one of the aides take you down the hall for hydrotherapy. It'll help you relax.Listen... I've got work to do. You're my cutest patient, but you're not my only one.My God!I'm sorry! Sorry --can't come in to work, are you crazy?! I can't even go to my apartment!

I'm house-sitting... This place belongs to a doctor friend of my parents. He's in China now, on research... won't be back for six months. The medical center only has my apartment address. Even my friends don't have this number. Will you believe me?! We're safe here.We'll find your friend O'Malley. We'll just keep phoning ...I'll buy tickets to that.Days? Try a few weeks.Danger is my middle name.Hey, hey -- I don't think you get the picture here. Your muscles have been getting electronic stimulation at the hospital, but it's not like actually being up and bearing weight.Mata Hari -- at your service.No problem. This is on my list for Safeway every day.I'll be in the other room.That's enough! I don't care how many needles you stick in yourself or how much ginseng root you eat ... you have to sleep if you're going to recover.That's an order!Jesus -- what a patient!-- You can't compare blood pressure readings now with when you were in a coma.
