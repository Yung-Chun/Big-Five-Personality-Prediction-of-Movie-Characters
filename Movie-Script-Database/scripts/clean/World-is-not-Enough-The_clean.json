{"World-is-not-Enough-The": {"BOND": {"raw_line": "Which is neutral, no doubt.Perhaps later.My glasses.I didn't come for the money. The report you sold him was stolen from an MI-6 agent, who was killed for it.Who did you get it from?And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.Your last chance. Give me the name.Perhaps you failed to take into account my...hidden assets.The name?Have this checked, see what you can get off it.Thought you might want one of these.Construction's not exactly my line.Old friend?Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.Someone was watching over me in Geneva. A guardian angel with a laser sight.King.Stop! King!Yes.Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.You knew him well?I'm sorry.She's not a girl anymore.It's barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.It's just a scratch.Ethical? Can't we just skirt the issue?Strenuous activity?Perhaps after this ... test?I could come for a second opinion?Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle. Largest landlocked body of water on Earth. Oil-rich. Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.So Sir Robert's goes through Turkey, direct to the Med...?Kill the man, kill the pipeline.Tell me about the kidnapping of Elektra King.I took the initiative.I was the one who brought that money in...The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.Whoever kidnapped Elektra is the same man who killed her father.Who?Renard.Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?He survived?'That which does not kill me makes me stronger.'He's not through yet. Renard doesn't blow up five million dollars unless he knows there's more coming in. He's working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline. And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.The worm on the hook again.Scottish heavy metal, Q?And other uses, no doubt.That would make you...\"R\"?I'd rather you didn't play with that.Quite stunning.Yes.Funerals aren't exactly memorable.Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?Who is he?How long has he been with you?Does this look familiar to you?It's not the pin your father wore. It's an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.The killer doesn't want to see this pipeline continue, doesn't want to see you take over...I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King's daughter.Always wanted to see the upper lines.No.I've been known to.Head for that gully, I'll lure them into the trees!Should have stuck to snowboarding.Hold on to me.We're alright.You're not going to.It's the only way out...Elektra, look at me, look in my eyes!I can't stay.I don't know. But I will find him.I think you're one of the bravest people I've ever met....you should rest.I have to go.No. You'll be safe here.I have to go to work.Valentin Zukovsky.You, of course. I need some information.Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world. A nice little rat's nest.Boa. Have you had any therapy since Perestroika?How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.How high up does this...arms dealing go?But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.Oh, you'd be surprised.Two. Shaken not stirred.What the hell are you doing here?If this little show is for my benefit, I'll take you home right now.I understand it's normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.Stand or split them.Not at that price. Time to surrender.A night of burning passion?Shush....needs constant attention...Enough ice for one day.You never take this off?How did you survive?I can't afford to.Problem, comrade?Old habits die hard.Here goes nothing.Romashka.Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?Don't know any doctor jokes.Couldn't make it. Splitting headache.Will I need protection?To the nuclear facility at Penza 19.Corporal?Indeed.Don't come any closer.Who's paying you to destroy the pipeline?Revenge isn't so hard to fathom. What's clever is getting someone else to pay for it.Who is it?You will never touch her. You will never get near her.Consider me ungrateful.She'll get over it.Keep away, Colonel.Here's your imposter. He's paid off the men on the plane outside. They're not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they're flying it wherever he tells them.Close the door! Close the door!Shame you had to spot I wasn't the real thing.Bond --James Bond.With this?You look surprised.A little. Does it matter? After all, what's the point of living if you can't feel alive? Isn't that right, Elektra? Isn't that your motto?Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...You can drop the act, it's over.I think you do.At MI-6 we call it Stockholm Syndrome. It's common in kidnappings. A young impressionable victim. Sheltered, sexually inexperienced. A powerful kidnapper skilled in torture, in manipulation. Something snaps in the victim's mind. The captive falls in love with her captor.He used your exact words.I'm coming with you.They hit about 90 minutes ago. There's a scientist here from the International Decommissioning Agency, Dr. Jones. She has ten crews combing the area.The report King bought. It's a manual. Renard's men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.They're getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons? I can't help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...Is maybe...the inside woman.Stop it.Speed?It'll reach the other end in seventy- eight minutes. Any more of these rigs?Come on.Unless you'd like to see my ID first.Be one along any minute.When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?Alright then, brunch.Faster! Get our speed up!Then it's no longer a bomb?Let it blow.Let it blow.Trust me. Leave it.I did kill us. She thinks we're dead. And she thinks she got away with it.It's part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack. The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.Elektra King.Makes her look even more innocent.I was hoping you could tell me.Loud and clear. I have to speak to M.What?She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now. And M's life is part of the bet.I know I promised you champagne, but would you settle for caviar?She's no innocent. This is my nuclear consultant.What's your business with Elektra King?She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn't even bat an eyelid. She was paying you off. What for?You are out of your league. She's working with Renard.Tell us what you know, Zukovsky. Tell us, before its too late.Now...where were we?No. The truth! She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you. What do you know that she would kill you for?You're in this thing up to your neck.And the payoff on the tables?Where's the sub going?!This is too big for even you. Where is it?Where?Your old friend Dmitri.Nuclear.Made to look just like an accident.The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...Elektra would control it all.Whoever gets there first, Zukovsky. They have M.The locator card. It's M.The rest?How appropriate.If I don't get to the Boa before he gets to Maiden's Tower, M is dead.Not interested.Where's M?All this, because you fell for Renard?You turned Renard.So you killed your father.Was this all about the oil?No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.Elektra, it's not too late. Eight million people needn't die.You meant ... nothing ... to me.One... last... screw?Call him off.I won't ask again. Call him off!I never miss.How do you want to die? That? Or this?We go down to the torpedo bay.Tanks open.You're really going to commit suicide for her?Haven't you heard the news? So is she.He's sealed himself in.Like riding a bike.Just wanted to put him on edge...Climb!Keep moving.There's one chance.Re-breathers.Never liked those things anyway.Count to twenty. When you get to twenty open the hatch. It can only be opened for a few seconds or we'll sink.Count to twenty. I'll be there.Christmas!She's waiting for you.We're sinking.We've got to get out.I love Christmas in Turkey.", "clean_line": "neutral doubt later glasses come money report sold stolen mi agent killed know difficult swiss chance failed account hidden assets checked thought want construction exactly line old friend buys classified reports million pounds watching geneva guardian angel laser sight king stop king yes sir robert word man upstairs knew sorry girl anymore barely scratch dome broke fall need pass fit molly scratch ethical skirt issue strenuous activity test come second opinion caviar capital world matchless beluga firm subtle largest landlocked body water earth oil rich hitler wanted stalin beat sir robert goes turkey direct med kill man kill pipeline tell kidnapping elektra king took initiative brought money money killed robert king ransom demand elektra kidnapped elektra man killed father renard sacrifice girl terrorist survived kill makes stronger renard blow million dollars knows coming working wants stop pipeline hired perfect killer vendetta king worm hook scottish heavy metal uses doubt play stunning yes funerals aren exactly memorable want finish pipeline long look familiar pin father wore exact duplicate inside tiny electrical detonator reason believe assassin inside accomplice worked company killer want pipeline continue want think running pipeline difficult job especially king daughter wanted upper lines ve known head gully ll lure trees stuck snowboarding hold alright going way elektra look look eyes stay know think bravest people ve met rest ll safe work valentin zukovsky course need information mafia warlords diplomats spies consortiums country world nice little rat nest boa therapy perestroika terrorist like renard supply men state art russian army weapons remember cyrillic says st airborne division high powered paraski trying kill high arms dealing gain killing robert king stopping pipeline oh surprised shaken stirred hell little benefit ll home right understand normally good practice feel cards going deep end stand split price time surrender night burning passion shush needs constant attention ice day survive afford problem comrade old habits die hard goes romashka yes viktor davidov miss know doctor jokes couldn splitting headache need protection nuclear facility penza corporal come closer paying destroy pipeline revenge isn hard fathom clever getting pay touch near consider ungrateful ll away colonel imposter paid men plane outside taking bomb russian facility flying tells close door close door shame spot wasn real thing bond james bond look surprised little matter point living feel alive isn right elektra isn motto steal old friend renard run knew knew shoulder knew exactly hurt drop act think mi stockholm syndrome common kidnappings young impressionable victim sheltered sexually inexperienced powerful kidnapper skilled torture manipulation snaps victim mind captive falls love captor exact words coming hit minutes ago scientist international decommissioning agency dr jones crews combing area report king bought manual renard men remove radio tracking device warhead getting weapons russians getting money buy weapons help thinking person close king switched pin maybe inside woman stop speed ll reach end seventy minutes rigs come like id minute bury hatchet celebrate champagne dinner alright brunch faster speed longer bomb let blow let blow trust leave kill thinks dead thinks got away plan dresses like terrorist attack explosion covers theft plutonium elektra king makes look innocent hoping tell loud clear speak upped stakes chips table life bet know promised champagne settle caviar innocent nuclear consultant business elektra king dropped million half dollars house house bat eyelid paying league working renard tell know zukovsky tell late truth thought dead blades meant know kill thing neck payoff tables sub going big old friend dmitri nuclear look like accident right kind explosion right spot block bosphorus cut black sea explosion like kill pipelines way oil caspian pump world elektra control gets zukovsky locator card rest appropriate boa gets maiden tower dead interested fell renard turned renard killed father oil believe melt accident elektra late million people needn die meant screw won ask miss want die torpedo bay tanks open going commit suicide haven heard news sealed like riding bike wanted edge climb moving chance breathers liked things count open hatch opened seconds ll sink count ll christmas waiting sinking ve got love christmas turkey"}, "ELEKTRA": {"raw_line": "Excuse me.He shouted. He shouted all the time --...they should have been in place two days ago. That is the target my father set.Find me the research on the limestone deposits, go ahead and place these orders, and get the jeep ready. I will go to Ruan myself...I said, I will go.Would you excuse us, Davidov?I met you at my father's funeral.I haven't been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don't want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father. I loved him. I'm not sure he knew that.Partially, yes.No, Gabor. We have a guest.My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. He's decisive, vigilant. And he makes an excellent omelette.Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?It's my father's pin. He wore it everyday of his life.Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?If you've come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you. I have two bodyguards, I don't need a third...That's every man within a five mile radius. Including you. That's why you're here, isn't it? You think I can't do it. You think I'm going to screw up. Or get myself killed.You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.My mother's people discovered oil here ninety years ago. The Bolsheviks slaughtered them for it. Some say oil is in my family's blood. I say our blood is in the oil. This is the very heart of the planet. Up here in the hills was Eden, literally. Look what the Russians did to it. Now we have a second chance and this time we'll do it right. When the other wells have all dried up, she'll still be pumping her lifeblood to the world. And this Will be one of the main arteries...Send the pipe around.Then my father was wrong.I have to check the upper lines. Gabor will drive you back.You don't take no for an answer, do you?Alright then. Do you ski?Just hold her steady. You wanted to see it.We're building from both ends. This is where they'll meet. Fifteen hundred miles from the Caspian to the Mediterranean.Are they gone? All of them?Oh my God...we're buried alive...I can't stay here.No! It will cave in!I can't breathe, I can't breathe...Are you alright?I know.I need to ask you something. And I need you to tell me the truth.Who is it? Who is trying to kill me?After the kidnapping...I was afraid to go outside, to be alone, to be in a crowd, to do anything at all, until I realized... There's no point in living if you can't...feel alive.I can't huddle in the shadows. I can't let fear run my life. I won't.The way I acted, in the snow...you must think I'm a coward.What is it?James...Then take me with you.I don't want to be safe!Now who's the coward?And his account?Vodka martini.Someone wants to kill me, I'd rather die looking him straight in the eye. What are you doing here? Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?You had your chance, James. Now I'm looking for a bigger thrill.Really?I like the deep end, James.Surely you believe in living dangerously.Hit me.Time to surrender.You knew when you first saw me. You knew it would be like this.Poor shoulder. Looks painful...Why do men always want to undress the one part of a woman's body she doesn't want to reveal?I used my body on the guards. It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance. I've never told anyone that.Do you ever stop, James? Do you ever think about...another kind of life?Don't worry. I know who you are.I'm sorry. I would never call you except...Bond's disappeared. He...he left my villa, some time in the middle of the night and...My head of security has been found near a local airstrip, murdered...Could...could you come?I just can't help thinking...I'm next.Gabor...?James!What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?What are you talking about?...what?Are you saying...Renard is the man who's trying to kill me?I don't know what you're talking about!How dare you! How dare you! That animal!? That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me! So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn't have to sleep with you to find that out.You knew. You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?He's struck again. Five men are dead at the pipeline.You do what you have to do, but I've called in M. She's en route from London even now.That's not right.It's an observation and repair rig. Travels along the pipe, checks for broken seals. But it's not supposed to be there.My God. Have the terminal evacuated.You can evacuate my workers, but I'm not going anywhere.Do you think he's dead?I have a gift for you. Something that belonged to my father. He would have wanted you to have it.Please.He often spoke of how...compassionately you advised him on the best course of action during my kidnapping.It's very valuable, you know. I just couldn't let it explode with the rest of him.Take her to the chopper.You're hurting me.Brought me something?Warm.I've brought something for you as well.Just as I promised.Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didn't think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.Is nothing. His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back.How would you know?Of course...What do you think?What about this?But surely......You can feel this?Remember ... pleasure?Now you know how it feels. To be locked away, to wonder if they're coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.Who? Bond? Bond is dead.Somehow, I find that strangely ...disappointing.Time for you to die.No. It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.James Bond and his amazing resurrection. If only you'd kept away, we might have met again in a few years, become lovers once more.Take her to Renard.Pretty thing. You had her too?I could have given you the world.They were digging near here and they found some very pretty vases. They also found this... I think we ignore the old ways at our peril, don't you?Soon she'll be everywhere.Five more turns and your neck will break.Since I was a child, I've always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldn't rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.Just like you...only you were even easier.I told him he had to hurt me, he had to make it look real. When he refused I told him I would do it myself.He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.It is my oil! Mine and my family's!It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. I'm going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfather's name, the glory of my people.They will believe. They will all believe.You understand? Nobody can resist me.Know what happens when a man is strangled?You should have killed me when you had the chance. But you couldn't. Not me. A woman you've loved.Oh James.What a shame. You just missed him.Excuse me.Everything's under control up here. Are you ready?Zukovsky really hated you. Time to say goodnight.James. You can't kill me. Not in cold blood.Renard.You wouldn't kill me. You'd miss me.Dive!
