You're the one being all inconsistent.I agree with Drax. It's hardly important right now.No, I really agree with him.Groot, look - !What is he doing?!That doesn't make sense!Its skin is the same thickness from the inside as from the out!Gamora, there's a cut on its neck - Rocket, get it to look up.Hey, you giant Sea Monkey, up here!Anulax batteries.That's nothing like what I just said. But they're worth thousands of units a piece. Which is why the Sovereign hired us to protect them.Just be careful what you say around these folks. They're easily offended and the cost of transgression is death.That's the kind of thing you might want to keep to yourself.I guess I prefer making people the old-fashioned way.Yeah, I mean, if it's for research that could be pretty --Pretty repulsive. I'm not into that kind of casual -Family reunion. Yaaaay.Thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.My mother is from earth.He's... not from Missouri, that's all I know.That stuff about my father. Who does she think she is?I'm not sensitive about it. I just don't know who he is.Sorry if it looked like I was flirting with her. I wasn't.I think you do care. That's why I'm apologizing.Uh huh.Well, that is pretty hot, but--All right, okay, fascinating, don't need to hear it. I get your point, I'm a dancer and Gamora is not.We got an armed Sovereign fleet, approaching from the rear.What were you thinking?!Oh! I didn't realize your motivation was altruism. A shame the Sovereign have mistaken your intentions and are trying to kill us.I WAS BEING SARCASTIC!SHUT UP, DRAX! You knew! You should have told us!Do not try to bro down with me right now, dude. I will fricking punch you in your fricking face.More incoming!What's the closest habitable planet?How many jumps?Lucky for us -I've been flying this rig since I was ten years old.You were cybernetically engineered to be a douchebag.You put your turd in my bed, I shave you.Groot, he's right, you have to start aiming inside the box.Our weapons are down!Where's he going?Son-of-a-! They went around the field!Doesn't matter! That's the jump point! GO! GO!Groot, put on your seat belt!Prepare for a really bad -If what's between my legs had a hand on it, I guarantee I could have landed this ship.More like because he stoled Anulax batteries!No, they're not!I'm not going to answer to `Star- Munch.'Dick.That's how eyes work, you stupid raccoon.Oh, I'm sorry, I meant to say `trash panda.'It's worse.You'd think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly lie.Who the hell are you?Because I was a skinny kid who could squeeze into places adults couldn't, making thieving easier.What?We've been together all this time and you thought Yondu was my actual, blood relative?He wasn't my father. Yondu was the guy who abducted me. He'd beat the crap out of me so I'd learn how to fight and he kept me in terror threatening to eat me.Yes.Not buying it.Give me a break! After all this time, and he just expects to be my Dad all of the sudden!I mean, this could be a trap - the Kree purists, the Ravagers, now the Sovereign - they all want us dead.But what?Who?David Hasselhoff?He had a talking car, not a magic -Just to be a good friend, I guess.Shooting Knight Rider or touring with his band in Germany. Why are you bringing this up now? I was drunk when I told you that.I don't. It's just sad! I was so sad because I'd see the other kids off playing catch with their dads, and I wanted that, more than anything in the world.I have clones.There's no way for them to know they're here.You're like an old woman.So what's your goal here? To get everyone to hate you? `Cause it's working.Can I ask you a personal question?The antennae, what are they for?You're not supposed to say that.Just making clear - if it's anything else - any other answer - I win?Three pairs of pants.You read minds?Yeah, I guess, yeah, I have sort of a general, unselfish love for everyone.No. No, I don't.No.What the hell, dude? That's a total overreaction.You got to be kidding me.That's so incredibly uncool.Like what?It's kind of like someone put a baby's head on a big, muscular body, isn't it?Wow. You have your own planet?It's beautiful.Whoa. It's perfect.A Celestial. Like a... god?Wow.Dude.I don't need to hear about how my parents, you know -That's disgusting.Oh my God.When did you meet my mother?If you loved her why did you leave her?My mother told everyone my father was from the stars.She had brain cancer - so everyone thought she was delusional.Listen. I'd love to believe all of this, I really would - but you left the most wonderful woman ever, to die alone!So why didn't you come back?! Why'd you send Yondu, a criminal, of all people, to fetch me?!I know exactly what that's like! I had to watch her die!What do you mean?Whoa.So I guess this could all be mine someday.Dance with me.Come on. This is Sam Cooke, one of the greatest Earth singers of all time.Drax thinks you're not a dancer.When are we going to do something about this... unspoken thing between us?Well, that's a Catch-22. Because if you said there was, it would be spoken, and then you'd be a liar. So by saying there isn't, you're telling the truth, and admitting there is.What are you talking about? You were the one who wanted me to come here!Why are you trying to take this from me?He's my father. He's blood -Again - you made me come here! And Earth?! Earth is the place my mother died in front of me.This is real. I'm only half human, remember?Oh, I get it. You're jealous because I'm part god! You like me being the weak one!You know, this isn't Cheers after all. It's whatever the show is where one person is willing to, you know, open themselves up to new possibilities, and the other person is just kind of a jerk who doesn't trust anyone! It's a show that doesn't exist - it would never be made, it would be so horrible! It would get zero ratings!I finally found my family, don't you understand that!?So this is how it ends, then? Our whole story. Like this? You and me?Yeah.You know - ?Yes.Yeah, it is.Well, you might not be mortal, but ME -I'm immortal? That's... really?And I can use the light to make cool things? Like how you made all this?Well, get ready for an eight hundred foot statue of Pac Man, then. With Skeletor. And Heather Locklear. I'm gonna make some weird shit.Wow, that...How?Doesn't eternity get boring?I see it. Eternity.It's beautiful.My friends.Yes. I don't need that.Forever.Temporary.Yes.But my mother.You said you loved my mother.Wh- what?You killed my mother!NO.`I told you so.' That's really what I need right now.Because there's an unspoken thing.What's Smurfette doing here!?There's the center to him - his brain, his soul, whatever it is, in some sort of shell --YONDU?I guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid. Otherwise you would have delivered me to this maniac!That's what you told me, you old doofus!You said you were gonna eat me!Not to me!!Of course I have issues that's my fricking father!!... Thrusters are back up.We can't. Ego wants to eradicate the universe as we know it. We have to kill him.Rocket!I guess.I seriously can't believe that is where your mind goes.And the people.He needs my genetic connection to the light to help destroy the universe. He tried to teach me how to control the power.A little. I made a ball.I thought as hard as a could, that's all I could come up with.What do you use?We drill into the center, we kill him.Why aren't you firing the laser?!Is it strong enough to kill Ego?Meaning what?Go!Well...Which is the only kind of idea we got left.Uh, what a day.Hey, you're making him nervous!I don't have any tape. Let me check.Yo, Yondu, do you have any - ow! - do you have any tape?!No one has any tape.You have priceless batteries and an atomic bomb in your bag! If anyone had tape it would be you!Dude, you're wasting time!We're gonna blow!You look like Mary Poppins.Yeah. He's cool.Oh. Wow.How long before the bomb goes off?Someone needs to be up top when Kraglin arrives. Drax, take Mantis.Gamora!!You shouldn't have killed my mom and squished my walkman.What's so wrong with that?What?What?Yondu, you can't! What are you doing? What are you doing?!Yondu. Yondu, no!No.No!The other day I told Gamora how I used to pretend my dad was David Hasselhoff.He's a singer and actor from earth... a really famous guy.And, you know, today it struck me. Yondu didn't have a talking car, but he did have a flying arrow. And he didn't have the voice of an angel, but he did have the whistle of one. And both David Hasselhoff and Yondu went on kickass adventures, and hooked up with hot women, and fought robots.So, the thing is, David Hasselhoff kinda did end up being my Dad after all, only he was Yondu. I had a pretty cool Dad.And what I'm trying to say here is, that thing you're searching for your whole life, sometimes it's right there by your side all along and you don't even know it.Wait.Rocket grabbed the pieces and reassembled them. I think Yondu would want you to have it.It's a Ravager funeral.No.Of course not.What?Dude, seriously, you got to clean up your room. It's a complete mess.I'm not boring, man. You're boring. Once I got stuck on a planet where everyone was just lines and dots. I had to use geometry to get out of prison. Is that boring?You know what's boring? Not doing the dishes. What's boring is me tripping over your vines everywhere.Drax and I switched pants in the middle of that party last weekend. For no reason other than we're awesome and very much not boring.Once I got a venereal disease that made me float for three days... Don't tell Gamora... it's dormant, but... If that's boring then, I guess I'm boring.I'm not boring.What's boring is when you roll your eyes like that at me and make an exasperated sound like I'm an old, boring, stupid idiot.Now I know how

I think I packed a small detonator.We got these!If it is, it will cause a chain reaction throughout his entire nervous system.The entire planet will explode. We'll have to get out of here fast. I rigged a timer.The metal is too thick! For the bomb to work we'd actually need to place it on Ego's core. And our fat butts ain't gonna fit through those tiny holes.That's a terrible idea.Unbelievable. `Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that.'All right. First you flick this switch, then this switch. That activates it. And then you push this button, which will give you five minutes to get out of there. Whatever you do don't push this button, because that will set off the bomb immediately, and we'll all be dead. Now repeat back what I just said.Uh huh.That's right.No! That's the button that will kill everyone! Try again.No! That's exactly what you just said! How is that even possible?! Which button is the button you're supposed to push?! Point to it.NO!!!Shut up! And give me some tape! Does anyone have any tape out there!? I want to put some tape over the death button!Not a single person has tape?That's exactly my point!
