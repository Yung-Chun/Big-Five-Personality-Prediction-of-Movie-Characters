{"Siege-The": {"DEVEREAUX": {"raw_line": "We're online for exactly two minutes.Slow down.Gotcha.Nobody knows you're here. Not your people. Not even my President. You'll die here alone and be buried unknown -- barring some miracle.-- God? GOD? What you eat. Whether you eat. Sleep. Pain. Absence of pain. I decide. I make the day and the night. Even the way you got here -- a hand that reached down from the sky? God? I am your new God.Hi. I understand they call you Hub.Bill Devereaux.82nd Airborne, I know. Same time I was running the --God. Duty. Honor. Country. Where on Capitol Hill, Wall Street, or Hollywood would you find one man who's even paused over one of those words in the last ten years?You want me to get to the point. The President's concerned. He's worried that -- have you met him by any chance?-- With all the affection for the man I can tell you he doesn't know fuckall about terrorism, or the Mideast, that I don't put on his cue cards. What he's expert in is his own survival. You get my meaning?Agent Hubbard -- you look like you think I'm here to take your baby away!Which is what I said to the President -- the Army is not some big green police department. Stick with the man on the ground.You're sure you're not chasing your own tail, though?Old news.We can't release him.Hub, we can't release him because we don't have him. We never had him. And besides that, he's dead.The CIA? The CIA couldn't predict the fall of the Berlin Wall until bricks were hitting them in the head. The Libyans snatched the Sheik -- some sectarian Muslim thing -- I'll explain it next time you have a free week. They killed him. Qaddafi put out disinformation that it was us... Who was your source on this?...A woman will never know the Middle East. You're talking about a culture that keeps its women slipcovered. Elise Kraft can't tell a Sheik from the prophylactic of the same name.Please, don't let me --Sounds like I should get out of your way. We're there if you need us. Your father well, Elise?Top of her game. Well, go get 'em.With all respect, Senator, why don't we just stipulate that the President is a dumb son of a bitch so we can all get down to business.The Army is a broadsword not a scalpel. You do not want us in an American city.We only go if the President invokes the War Powers Act....Twelve hours after the President gives the word we can be on the ground. One light infantry division of ten thousand seven hundred men. Elements of the Rapid Deployment Force combined with Special Forces -- Delta. APC's, tanks, helicopters. And of course, the ubiquitous M-16A1 assault rifle, a humble weapon until you see a man carrying one outside your local bowling alley or Seven- Eleven. It will be noisy, it will be scary and it will not be mistaken for a VFW parade.That means civilian casualties. At a minimum it's a drunk private joyriding in a Hummer who runs down an old lady in Greenpoint. At a maximum... Make no mistake. We will hunt the enemy. We will find the enemy. And we will kill the enemy.And no card-carrying member of the ACLU is more deadset against it... than I am. Which is why I urge you... no, I implore you not to consider this option.What's that?That's Anthony Hubbard, FBI. He's the ASAC on the ground up there. They took out the first cell less than 36 hours after bus 87. I suggest we hear what he has to say ---- Amen to that.Ahmed Bin Talal. They're still under the impression that we have him.To refresh your memory, as I told you last time, it was the Libyans who --Let me give you some free advice, son. Don't get between me and the President. You might break a nail.As far as the President is concerned... No, we do not.Are you saying the President is prepared to take the necessary steps...?Today, with the invocation of the War Powers Act by the President, I am declaring a state of martial law in this city.To the best of our knowledge, we are opposed by no more than twenty of the enemy. He is hiding among a population of roughly two million.Intelligence tells us he is most likely Arab-speaking, between the age of fourteen and thirty. Narrowing the target to fifteen thousand suspects.We can further reduce that number down to those who have been in this country less than six months. Now you have twenty hiding among two thousand.If you are one of these twenty young men, you can hide among a population of similar ethnic background. Unfortunately for you, you can only hide there. And that population, in the classic immigration pattern, is concentrated. Right here in Brooklyn.We intend to seal off this borough. And then we intend to squeeze it. This is the land of opportunity, gentlemen. The opportunity to turn yourselves in. After sundown tonight any young man fitting the profile I described who has not cooperated will be arrested and detained.There is historically nothing more corrosive to the morale of an army than policing its own citizens.But the enemy would be sadly mistaken if they were to doubt our resolve. They are now face to face with the most fearsome killing machine in the history of man. And I intend to use it. And be back on base in time for the play-offs... That is all.Hub. Good to see you again.I am against it. It wasn't my call.Your operation had its chance, Hub, and you couldn't get it done. You're down three touchdowns. Time to bring in the first string.Are you questioning my patriotism?Hub, I want you to take a moment and reflect on my life as a soldier. I have a dozen tropical diseases I'll never entirely get rid of. I set off metal detectors with the shrapnel in my ass. I have watched men die and I have killed. Now I am serving my President and quite possibly not the best interests of my country, but my profession doesn't afford me the luxury of that distinction. I won't question your patriotism but don't you ever again question my command.Take a good look around, my friend, and tell me that's still true. But we're not shutting you out. In fact, I can't do it without you, Hub. I need men like you. Men willing to put it on the line like you did in that schoolroom. These stars mean I have been putting it on the line for thirty years... and never made a mistake worth remembering. Don't tell me I made a mistake about you.Code blue.Code Red.-- And his name is Haddad?If a mistake's been made we'll fix it.And I said we will look into it.There's an FBI office in Anchorage, Agent Hubbard. Fuck with me and you'll be learning a hundred and fifty new words for snow.The prisoner is being interrogated.How long have you been at it?How much longer, do you think, before he gives up the other cells --He knows.How long before he breaks?So -- what other models do we have --Shaking.What about it, Sharon?Works for the Israelis.We don't have thirty-six hours.Electric shock?Water?The time has come for one man to suffer in order to save the lives of hundredsYou're welcome to wait outside.I think we have to soundproof the room before we begin.Escort him out.Let's get this over with.Agent Hubbard, do you want to tell me exactly what you mean detaining Colonel Hardwick and six of my CID staff. Because that strikes me as a very peculiar idea of interagency liaison.What makes you so sure he was the last cell?Sharon is not trustworthy.My authority supersedes the civilian judiciary under the decree of martial law. Sorry.What's over.Release him?You don't know shit. Poor suffering Sharon and her poor suffering people. It's called \"going native\" -- the most elementary error of an intelligence operative and she made it. She had all of you working for her and she was working for them without even knowing it. And now they're getting exactly what they want, which is the Sheik will be back in the mix. But ten times as strong, because now he's the big man who stood up to the Americans. I did what was necessary. I make no apologies. If you think you're going to be able to use that file against me, you know even less about politics than I imagined.Because you don't have the balls. Did you expect me to get all weepy with gratitude? You serve your country.

What precisely is your involvement with these people....Call the judge.Daily reports. We tap his phone.Fair enough.We share him.Then don't tell him.Let him fly. But we better start seeing product.Any more surprises for me?Then I'm going home to get some things.I'll grab a cab.I know who you are, General.I served in the ---- 173rd.

These things come in waves.-- and not in cash I guarantee it.Frank's working another warrant --You mean people like you?It's... against... the... law.Just because you talk the talk doesn't make you an expert.

If I don't take 'em down properly they'll be on the street two hours from now. I could find dynamite, semtex, plutonium and a book of matches in there and unless I've got the right warrant it's all inadmissibleMy quaint laws? Last I checked you were an American citizen. And these happen to be the only laws we got. Look, I'm just a cop, okay, and I'm real sorry the cold war's over, and you Masters of the Universe got nothing going on over there in Afghanistan or Iraq or wherever -- but you're just not in the Middle East anymore...What about the others? See if we can get a pulse --Goddamn it. GODDAMN IT.It didn't fire. They had it rigged to the door and it didn't fire.We're too old to be lucky, Frank.But you work against them.So I'm a fanatic.Is that right?That's what my nephew keeps asking me. \"Why you with The Man, Unc?\"You read my file. You tell me.That was in my file?You believe in anything, Elise --?How about right and wrong?-- only my prom date wasn't packing a gun.Two inches. From the ground. So what's the latest from Samir. I want a list of every visa he sponsored.I once knew this undercover guy, started to care so much about his source --Have you considered that he might also be in bed with the other side?You're so confident.I don't know.-- Could I interrupt?There is something you probably haven't thought about doing?Nothing. Don't over-react. With all respect, gentlemen, I'm just a cop. To you these people may be martyrs, but to me they're criminals. And a criminal is no more than somebody who thinks he's better than everyone else. And he's not better. He only has to be wrong once. And that's where we come in. We run down a tip from a landlord, or we pick up a latent print from a bus. Our phones are ringing off the hook with people from the Arab community wanting to help.They love this country and they hate that these criminals are giving them a bad name. With their help and some old-fashioned shoe leather, we'll nail these guys.-- Are they confirmed?Sharon.Anthony Hubbard. Average intelligence. But 'til I hear otherwise this is still my show.I appreciate that, Colonel.You're standing on our infrastructure. Excuse me.-- Brooklyn.How many does that make it --?Frank. This is Sharon. -- I didn't catch the last name.Why was there no warning from Samir?Maybe I'll ask him.Over six hundred dead bodies.How the fuck can you be so sure?-- and financing the Sheik.-- And help bring down Saddam.So who are they? Give me names, Give me pictures. Not some history lesson.So you got nothing.Has he had any contact with them?How does he do it?And otherwise...He's waiting? What's he waiting for? More bodies? We got lots more buildings in midtown, maybe he's waiting to see how many they can blow up.YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT HOW I FEEL -- MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD. HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE DEAD.How?... Why soon?What's the tradecraft, Sharon? Ironsites, visuals? I love all that spy shit. I'm gonna haul your boy downtown, strap his ass to a polygraph and ask him all about you. Then I'm gonna send the transcripts to a friend of mine at the Times who just loves to write about the latest CIA link to some political horror show.It's lose-lose from here on in, who said that?How can you possibly remember who you're fucking?Except they're not saying anything worth listening to.He go there every day?Did you call the State Department?-- And?Don't you just love government?Sorry. From now on, we will raise our hands and wait to be called on --Danny --?I don't think we're there yet. It's also not going to stop these people.Thank you, sir. And to everyone else for their patience today. These are extremely difficult times -- London, Paris, we're not the first city to have to deal with this.In Tel Aviv, the day after they blew up the market, the market was full. This is New York. We can take it.Closer on the timer.QUIT BICKERING AND FIX IT!My neck's a little stiff, that's all.I know.You want a drink?Better days.Where's Samir?You'd like that.555-6354.How about running an FBI agent?...Why else are you here?Leave.Hubbard... What --? ...Slow down, slow down --I can't say the same, sir. Not in that uniform. I thought you were against this.\"I'm only following orders\" didn't work at Nuremberg. It may not be your policy but they're your tactics.Against our own team?I'm questioning your judgement, yes, sir.I'm not under your command, General.They're not shutting us out. They need men like me.We're putting Samir in play.Oh, right, he's high-strung. Only you can manage him. You and the CIA and the DIA and God-knows-who-else you're really working for --! Get back in there, Sharon, Elise, whatever the fuck your name is -- They'll probably make you a Colonel... if you're not one already.What, exactly, are your interests, Sharon? You protect Samir, you protect the agency. You're interested in protecting everything but your country.No, and I don't want to know. With you or without you we're putting Samir in play. Now.Does he understand the difference between the FBI and the DEA?You can stop it all right now.Let's just calm down for a second...We'll take care of you... don't worry. You just have to calm down ---- You got a student visa for Ali Waziri. Because... somebody asked you to -- Didn't they --?Hey, that's enough.Now... Nobody's going to burn you, nobody's going to call anybody -- -- Who asked you to get that visa?Don't be afraid. I can protect you. There's nothing to be afraid of.My beeper number. Anybody messes with you, I'm there in twenty minutes.You're not so bad yourself.Didn't get his number. Darn. Floyd, Hub. We need to put something together in a big-ass hurry... Where's Frank --?... Give him a 911.-- and find some kind of beat-up car... Well, beat it up yourself if you have to... 896 Commerce St... it's a garage in Red Hook... but remember -- -- they're pros.Jesus...We can hit him in less than an hour.Where are you going?FBI --! FBI --!Now... I'm gonna... reach... into my jacket... and show you... my shield.All Units, report in turn. If talking will reveal your position, just key your walkie...Yo...Tariq around?Tariq?You're Tariq Husseini?Damn. Do you think you could give him a message?Tell him the FBI is after him.Very... slowly... put your hands on top of the table.That wouldn't be a racist epithet, now would it? Stand up.Where are the others?Do as he says.Frank, slow down --I'll get him out.Frank --It's wrong, Frank. What can I say to you, but it's... all... terribly... horribly... wrong. Now, come with me.Frank... Haddad. Junior.Check this out, pal. His father's a federal agent for ten years.And you're just stupid enough to think that's an insult.There is no \"if\". I'm vouching for this kid. I want him out.You mean, like you're looking into me? Surveilling me? Breaking up my operations? If I'd known I was going to have to do your job for you I would never have left the army.Tariq Husseini is my prisoner. I want to see him.I want to see him.He can't give up the other cells if he doesn't know about them.What about her briefing? The strategy session -- she said the cells don't know about each other, that they --Are you people insane --?How about two men? How about three? How about public executions, that might work.General... you've lost men, I've lost men... but what you're doing... It doesn't work in Belfast. It doesn't work in Gaza. And it won't work here. -- What if... they don't want their leader back at all? You said yourself, we don't even have him. Maybe what they really want -- is that we herd our children into stadiums. Put soldiers into our streets. Radicalize people who want to think of themselves as Americans. Bend the law, shred the constitution. Because if we torture him -- and let's call it what it is... You... and I... then the country men like us have sworn to defend. And bled to defend. And died to defend... is gone. And they've won.So we do have the Sheik?Of course.What do you mean, let the justice system do its work.Why me?And what about her?You know who. How much is she complicit in all this?-- But first, you helped them.They were being slaughtered. They needed to get out. But they were on the watch list. So you got them visas. You and Samir.Doing what, exactly?You said you trained them. Tradecraft. Subversion. That's what you said, right? Only you left something out, didn't you... Didn't you, Sharon? You taught them how to make bombs.-- And now they're here, doing what you taught 'em.You watch the game?How's your boy?Green is about right.You sure he'll go through with it?I like watching better.Nothing's going wrong.That far?It's a shroud.First she turns off the tv, then she says it.The hammam.Let her go and you'll live.Let her go and you'll live --SAMIR --!No way you're going out there.Shut up.SHUT UP...I... CAN'T --!If there is a God, he weeps at the crimes we commit in his name.Officer down. OFFICER DOWN --!...Shhhhhhh...You... knew.Sharon... SHARON ---- what are you? I don't...Amen.I want to talk about a free society.The last cell has been taken down. It was Samir. I took him out.Sharon.Sharon is dead. She gave her life. This is a writ from the US District Court releasing all those being held here without habeus corpus.Your authority ends now. It's all over.They're going to release him.The Sheik. Clear violation of international law, Congressional oversight statutes, a couple of treaties, the Federal perjury statute, and my favorite, the Logan Act, for conducting your own personal foreign policy. I know the whole story, General.General. I'm not in politics. You can have this back. I won't use it.I said I wasn't in politics. I'm not.

answer.There's no reason to be nasty.Not according to the Cooperation Agreement, Special Order 12333 -- I suggest you reread the paragraph on sharing information. I happen to be well within my authority.Unfortunately, not yet. But as soon as I do, I'll --Swell.Nice meeting you, too, Special Agent Hubbard.Ralph, spare us.I never touched him.What are you going to charge him with? Jaywalking? I don't suppose we could just have a little chat with him here first?You know, Hub... may I call you Hub? If you guys hadn't blown the surveillance, we'd have been able to follow the money. What do you think, Khalil, you would have led us right to your friends, wouldn't you?One phone call and he's mine again. You know the number. I have --Oh, come on... Do you have any idea what you're starting here, the kind of shitstorm you're about to --Shouf mountains, right? Shiite or Sunni?American University of Beirut? I was there from '79 to 82.My father taught Economics. Henry Kraft?Such a tragedy. Growing up in that city was... paradise. Like an exotic Paris, wasn't it, Frank --?...Yum.What's happening out there...They've taken another bus, haven't they? Talk to me...Listen, these guys are the real deal.Yes.Yes. And I'm afraid this time they'll blow the bus.I... don't know.Agent Hubbard. Please. Maybe I can help.Oh, God....They're not here to negotiate.They were waiting for the cameras.They're want the newsies here. They want everybody watching.You've got the shooters in place?Use 'em.Kill 'em now.It's lose-lose any way you play it... Do you want to lose little or lose big?I didn't make the call.Are you alright --?Life's too short.We ordering in --?-- The funeral shroud is the final step in the ritual of self- purification. First a fast, then --...Last March in Iraq, we identified the man we believe responsible for bombing the army barracks last year. In August, he went to Lebanon. Where he was... extracted.His name is Sheik Ahmed bin Talal. He's Iraqi. And something of a religious leader.He's still being... debriefed. They're not ready to go public with charges.Clearly, they're committed.In this game, the most committed wins.Unless we match their commitment with our own.You don't think they've got guys talking to the sheik? Except the sheik isn't talking.Believe me, we've put every resource we've got onto that very question. Otherwise... we wait.If there's anybody on earth who knows how you feel, it's me. But you've got to let it go. Those people were dead the minute they got on the bus.You might consider leaving him alone.Play him like a cop and haul him in now and get your arrest, or tag him and let him lead you to the really big fish.You ever heard of catch and release?Club Fed.I still don't understand why we're tipping our hand with him --...Sometimes... in addition to being a nationality, being a Palestinian is also a... profession. A lucrative one.Mine. Yours. The Israelis. The Saudis. At one time or another, everybody in the Middle East has slept with everybody else.Only professionally.No.I can't let you do that.Samir's been a very important... project of mine for some time... I'm the only one he'll deal with. He's very well-connected -- and extremely high-strung.How easy is it to get inside, Frank? How good are your sources in the mosques? How many people you got in Hamas --?No surveillance. I've seen your deft touch.And I get to see the transcripts.And I run him.He can't know we're talking.Done.Not tonight.Next time don't be such a smart ass ---- You want to fuck me? Then work with me.No? Do we really want to have this conversation again? Do we --?I need you to help me. I need you to be strong. As you have always been strong. For both of us. -- Samir? Look at me...-- So who are you afraid of betraying? You know these people. They bomb, they maim. Do they represent the Palestine you want to build? They're using you.I had to get special permission for that.Hub, we've got Judge Frankel in -- Oh. Hello, General.Sorry. That tip on the landlord looks solid. The judge will see us right away.As can be expected. How's Maggie?Making new friends.So... you like to watch --?It's a full contact sport.-- Not two Judges from now, not two HOURS from now, not two MINUTES from now. These guys could split any SECOND and you've lost your best shot at --You don't understand, they're pros! From the age of twelve they've been dodging people like you, people better than you.-- no matter how sparkling your record is, no matter how terrified you are to fail ---- Just because you went to night school, or filled out the back of a matchbook or whatever you did to get a law degree doesn't make you Sir Thomas More.You're gonna lose them and they're gonna do another horrible --They've also got a warrant. A warrant from God. They're ready to die! And your quaint laws don't mean shit to these people.Oh, really...?They're discussing how hard it is to find a decent cup of coffee over here. I make out three voices. What do you have on the infrared?Gone.My first boyfriend was Palestinian. My father liked to say, they seduce you with their suffering.You ever been over there --? ...The courtesy with which they welcome you into their homes. And the people, these incredibly... warm people in this... austere land.Only the crazies. I tend to be suspicious of all true believers. Present company included.Let's just say you don't seem the ambivalent type.So why're are you a fed?...Well? What'd you tell him?Let's see... Catholic school. Captain of this, president of that. Hard work, fair play, make a difference, change the system from within. Rah. Rah. Rah....Tell me I'm wrong....What --?Like what, for instance?It's easy to choose between right and wrong. What's hard is choosing the wrong that's more right. I just want to make it all... a little... better. Ignore me. I'm shitfaced.You were in charge of Waco, right -- ? Or was that Ruby Ridge?Yeah, yeah, yeah... And J. Edgar Hoover wore a dress.What do you say, Hub...? Peace?This feels like high school.Mine's a 9 mm. How big is yours?Not sure he'll do it.-- Samir's a source. Period.Samir in bed with them? That would too much to wish for.Only in bed.We all know the traditional model of a terrorist network. One cell controlling all others. Cut off the head and the body will wither.Unfortunately the old wisdom no longer applies. The new paradigm is like the myth of the Hydra. Each cell exists independent of the other. Cut off one head and another rises up in its place.Bus 87 was the work of Cell #1. Its elimination only activated the work of Cell #2 -- the theatre gala.We don't know.This is Colonel Hardwick. Army Intelligence.I'm... very sorry... about your friends....Bridger. How ya doin' Frank?The agency has come up with another list of probables.I think we should circulate them. Hey, this stuff may be good.Because he didn't know anything.Says me.Over my dead body.Look, he's one of the good guys. Okay?Because he helped me recruit the network in Iraq. OKAY?We were part of the operation to destabilize Saddam Hussein. Printing up fake dinars, arming the Kurds --He's Iraqi. He was going to be our Ayatollah Khomeini --I ran the network. Samir was the go- between. He risked his life for us over there.I can't give you pictures because I don't know what they look like. We did everything at arm's length.I've got Samir.Minimal.He can't. They initiate.He's waiting.Look, I know how you must feel --They'll make contact soon.You burn him, you lose any chance you ever had.I'm not fucking with you.I need... more time. Please. You're hurting me. Please...This just came in.You alright?That's not what I meant.Sure.That was a pretty crazy thing you did today.I wanted to -- I... just didn't feel like... being alone... tonight.I could call him. Maybe he'd join us.I might. Or I could call Tina.Look, I thought Samir'd be an easy recruit. He wasn't. It was crazy but I did what I had to do. You know as well as I do, running an agent can be very... complicated.You think I'm trying to run you?...You know why I'm here.Tell me to leave.No.He'll fuck it up, the arrogant prick. You ever met anybody so in love with the sound of his own voice?Now? With all this going on? He's freaked.All this... is no more in our interest than it is in yours, Hub.You have no idea what I do for my country.One more lamb to the slaughter.Samir... It's fine, he's cool.Liar --!You... tell him... what he wants to know.He knows. He fucking knows.Stop simpering.I've got a picture of the two of us, do you remember that picture, Samir? I'm going to post that picture in every mosque in Brooklyn. And then I'm gonna send copies to some friends of mine on the West Bank. You've got family there, don't you --?Let go of me --You're good.You calling Devereaux.Tariq will go to ground.Hit him hard.I've got to stash Samir someplace safe. Go with God.Not long enough, apparently.At this rate. Too long. The theatre was hit nine hours after we took down the first cell.-- Won't work.Only in conjunction with sleep deprivation. Needs at least thirty- six hours.The neurotransmitters just shut down.He knew nothing.I ran an Iraqi network for two years. Samir recruited them from among the Sheik's followers. I trained them in the North. Then we played them back into Baghdad, two, three at a time, hiding them in the mosques...It was gonna be beautiful. -- And then there was a policy shift ---- The new doctrine was: Iran will be too powerful if Iraq falls apart. And it's not like... we sold them out. Exactly. We just... stopped... helping them. And I wasn't allowed to tell them what was coming down. I was ordered not to tell them. -- And they got slaughtered.You've got to understand -- these people... believe. Paradise. Bliss. To us they're just words. But to them... It's very beautiful, actually. And when you look at their lives, the heartbreak... And what do we do? We think, aha, we can take advantage of that. So I quit. I came home. I just can't... do it... anymore.What do you mean --?I promised we would take care of them. They were working... for us.I don't know what you mean.And I'm going to have to live with the hell of that for the rest of my life.In case you decide to go on walkabout.How did you make contact?But you're sure he'll show up.I need to deliver it in person. Believe me, they'll want to hear what I have to say.That's Samir.He's terrified. Then again, so am I.If he doesn't he knows I'll give him to Devereaux. How's it feel to be on the other end of it?This is the endgame, you understand that? If this goes wrong --We're the CIA, something always goes wrong.I don't suppose there's any way you would trust me to do this on my own? I thought not. Well, in case it gets hairy, remember... the most committed wins.Shhhhhh... If you'd stop whining you'd feel the surveillance.Wait for the light to turn yellow and then cross against the traffic.Sit. Raise your arm.They cannot even dream we are being followed, isn't that what you said?...They're going to hit the march.Here. Put this on. We don't want our friends sweating too much while they wait.\"...sweating too much while they wait.\"How soon are they coming?What are you doing --?I'll tell them when they're here.Nobody else is coming, is there?You're the last cell.How could I have missed the play ---- Just tell me we didn't finance your operation...They're going to release him.A few months at most. First, they have to bring him to trial, but ---- But... that's what you want, isn't it? Why you've done all this --Samir, the Koran preaches --But it's over, your point's been made, why spill any more blood? Those poor people out there in the street, they're fucking marching for your cause...NO --!!!DON'T --!!!!Shoot.Shoot.SHOOT ME --!!!No --!!!Is... he... dead?...no... regrets...I... wondered....
