We now reveal three men in civilian clothing in the dark afternoon light of the little room. Actually it's a plywood office somewhere in the processing hall and we hear the din from the hall over the question and answer. Two of the men sit around a desk, the Third Man stands in a corner, staring at Tony, the most authoritative-looking of the three. MAN #l You been in a mental hospital, Tony?Yeah, in the boat coming over.Never tried it. What the fuck's wrong with this guy, what's he think I am?Fuck no.. Never.

Silence. 7- There's a certain eloquence to the man`s plea but it falls on disbelieving ears. One of them chuckles.Hey, that's okay, too, Harry. No hard feelings.

The noise The windows are caged and we see INS guards. level is high, like a sack of monkeys. Manny Ribera's got his feet up on an empty seat. He's big, strong, handsome, with dashing darkly feminine eyes -- younger than Tony, and dapper in his cheap clothing. He's eating a Baby Ruth candy bar.So I'll sit in your lap. Tony pushes his feet off, sits. He takes the Baby Ruth out of Manny's hand, peels out the bar of chocolate, then returns the empty wrapper to Manny,So what'd you tell them?You know if you hadn't opened your mouth, they woulda thought you were a horse. I told you to tell them you was cured. had TB andYou did nothing right. I shoulda left you in Cuba.That Bogart, Chico, hunh? CONTINUEDThat gold dust blowing in the wind. Y'see Manny, he's always looking over his shoulder. Hunh? Like me.... He hunches, darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder, imitating Bogart. Manny laughs. In his black shirt with zig-zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses, Tony's starting to look American. He's even got himself a pop button pinned to his shirt that says \"Fuck Off and Die.\" And hi6 English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidence more pronounced.I . . don't trust nobody.Never happen to me, Chico. That's one thing I never gonna be. I never gonna be crazy like that.I know.Assholes, I go crazy. You Manny, I never go crazy with you. You're like my brother, I love you!c'mon.

Manny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a car screeching to a halt in front of him.Okay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff. The blonde has paused to look in a shop window.Pobre hijo de puta -- you got it all mixed up. This country first you gotta get the money, then you get the power and when you got the power, then you get the women -- and then, Chico, you got the world by the balls.

His hands are shriveled white from dishwater.El Mono? Shit.... CUT TO 30 EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT 30' Omar Suarez is so named 'cause he looks like one. Nervous, crooked, darting eyes, feverish intelligence, constantly smoking a cigarette and coughing between words, his face pock-marked and pitted like the moon from an old acne scars, he cuts a skinny figure at the wheel of a big beige Coupe De Ville, idling the motor...with him is Waldo Rojas eating a large foot and a half banana. In contrast he's amiable, heavyset with a receding hairline, flashing a lot of gold when he smiles.You gotta be kidding! Whaddayou think we are -- baggage handlers? CONTINUED...five hundred dollars -- shit! What'd I do for you guys in the slammer, hunh? What was the Rebenga hit -- game of dominoes or somethin'?

You thing's wrong. ready, Angelito? CONTINUEDLet's go.... CUT TOHow you doing amigo...? The other person in the room is a tough-looking little dark Columbian chick with expressionless eyes, red fingernails, and short boy-cut hair, \"The Lizard\"; she's tinier than the Toad, about five-two. The Toad looks around the corridor, eases the door closed.Mind leaving the door open so my brothers know everything's okay... okay? Toad shrugs and readjusts, leaving it open a few inches, the conversation clipped and nervous throughout the scene.Hello, Marta. She nods woodenly, stays across the room. Behind her, the television set is on to the Cable Newswatch. The protagonists intermittently flick their eyes to it, soothing the tension.Yeah. I'm Tony. So Omar says you're okay.You know Omar.Okay....Yeah, you got the stuff?Yeah well I don't got it either, I got it close by, too.How far's your stuff? No. Tony paces back towards, the door casually, $0 check Angel out.. .The Lizard staring at him. .. CONTINUEDSo what do we do, walk in and start over?What fuckin' difference does it make where I'm from?You get to know me when you start doing business and not fucking around, Hector.Okay, what's the stall here? Your guy late or something?Frog face, you just fucked up. You steal from me, you're dead. Toad shrugs, he couldn't care less.Try sticking your head up your ass. See if it fits. Toad, completing the body search, rips out the stiletto taped to the small of Tony's back. As he mutters something in hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel into the bathroom, producing strands of thick rope. Even more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now pull6 out of the suitcase under the bed. Toad begin6 assembling it as Lizard, still covering Tonywith her gun, completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on the television set. The news, not 50 ironically in Miami, is about a drug-related triple-homicide.Go fuck yourself. Toad's eyes narrow meanly.I got him!Your'turn, cabron!... The Toad whips around to the voice, eyes stark with terror. Tony empties the clip into the Toad, blowing hiin apart. The bystanders just stare, stunned by the ferocity. Then an old lady faints. The Toad's body lying awkwardly arched in the gutter, Tony turns and with a passing disinterested glimpse at his audience, calmly walks back into the motel; the distance and the light sufficient to conceal Tony's possible identi- fication. CUT TO 'Manny, you okay? Manny nods.Chi-Chi, get the car. Fast!Yeah, bunch of cowboys!..somebody fucked up Omar. CONTINUEDYOU do that, Omar, you do that.Yeah -- - I got the yeyo. andE'uck you.
