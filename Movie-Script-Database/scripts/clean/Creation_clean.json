{"Creation": {"DARWIN": {"raw_line": "They were all completely naked, the men as well as the women, with hair down to their bottoms. They spoke in grunts and they never washed their hands and faces! In many respects they resembled wild animals, except that animals are kinder to their children.One day, Captain Fitzroy went ashore to meet them.No. It is only a beam of light.Well they prepare a copper plate with chemicals on it. The chemicals are sort of energized by the light reflecting off your face. Then silver sticks onto the plate according to where the light is brightest.So as I was saying, Captain Fitzroy went ashore to interview the Fuegans....After some discussion persuaded three of the savages` children to come home with him.Their names were Jemmy Buttons, York Minster and Fuegia Basket.The captain had them washed and got their hair cut, then dressed them in proper clothes, and taught them proper table manners.York Minster died of the smallpox but the other two learned English and went to meet the queen.Two years later. Captain Fitzroy and I took them back, in the company of a young Parson, hoping they would bring the other savages to god and to teach the others by example.And what do you think happened?Correct! A complete and total failure!Thank you ParslowHe won't stay long.I think this is not the time to discuss it.He sent a telegram. I'm sorry if it inconveniences you.Tell Mr Davies it was delicious, but my stomach is not quite right yet. Excuse me.Maybe best if I just burn the whole lot.Don't be absurd. Of course you're not.Ah yes.Of course I remember.Annie. Annie. Annie.Just playing.I should add that she is musical.Do you mean there will be more.Appeal? Dearest cousin. I am making plans for an army!Cycrus caraboides. You can see from the mandibles he's a hunter. He feeds on slugs and snails.Oh tush.... I studied Theology for a year but yet I know exceedingly little of the bible.I should look forward to that immensely.On the Beagle, quite, often we would drop a flask in the ocean and find it teeming with living particles which glowed in the night....so much beauty for so little purpose.Are you familiar with the works of Thomas Malthus, Mr Innes?.He made the point that if every trout, say, has a hundred offspring And so on and so on through the generations. Then the planet would be knee deep in trout in just a few decades.It doesn't strike you as an exceedingly wasteful plan - these myriad lives created only to be immediately extinguished.You think they are happy about it?....To be doing Gods will.No I'm serious. If thousands are destroyed that a few may live their lives, is not the general sum total of happiness not in some kind of massive deficit?I think it is a battlefield. A constant and shifting struggle for survival between everything and everything else.Ring the two milky pouters. We'll sacrifice the tumblers and skeletonize them. Then...Just. ...to the shed with them. I shall clean myself up.Please I must beg of you....Sir, you are talking like a revolutionary and really...And you'd replace Gods Laws with what.Knowing, as we do, that most capital crimes are her everyday practises: Theft, rape, murder, adultery, infanticide....We live in a society bound together by the church. An improbable sort of barque I grant you but at least it floats. You suggest we change all that at a stroke. You wish me to rebuild, plank by plank, the very vessel we are sailing in.Like you said. You're in it.What are you doing, Annie?I have to work.I have no time....Why do you always ask for Jenny? Its so sad.Once apon a time there was a family of Orang-u-tangs living in the jungles of darkest BorneoTheir eldest daughter was the most loving, caring and trusting Orang of all.But these qualities in themselves cannot guarantee an ape's survival. Sometimes, quite the reverse.When she realized her danger it was too late.They put her in a bag and carried her off....Exactly.The hunters sold her the to the Sultan who promptly sold her to a visiting Englishman who packed her aboard a sailing ship and brought her to London zoo.In London she had many admirers - of whom your father was but one.Hoo hoo hoo hoo.Hm?Go on what.No. Why do you want to hear that bit?Presently.He thinks I should write it and be done with it. He feels it is a question of moral courage ...or the lack of it.His theory is that I am making myself ill by holding back. That I should lance the boil. Plunge in and hang the consequences.I've concluded he is right. Bite the gag. Speed is everything. It will all be over in a matter of months.You know that what concerns you concerns me also. What do think has held me in limbo all these years.Dearest Emma. You know This is not a decision made lightly........ It has been a very slow and gradual process, like the raising of continents.What else can I say to you, except that it seems the process is now complete.Excuse meNever better. Thank-you.A weasel.Annie, Annie, Annie.The weasel has to eat. Its the way of the world. AnnieNo, its not fair at all.....but still it is extraordinary, do you not think, that a weasel should learn to dance the polka.Good-night GeorgeGood-night WillyDearest EmmaThen we were wrong. She is not unique after all.This is Devonian, about 400 million years ago. Rocks like this might have fishes in them, trilobites, tree ferns, corals maybe....No that is Cretaceous Etty. It was made a hundred millions years ago, when this cliff was a coral reef and Down village was a swamp full of great crocodiles.We might find oysters and sponges imprinted in it, or dinosaurs if we were lucky...They are the giant lizards which lived on earth before there were any humans.Of course they are, Betty. Did I never tell you of the skeletons I found in South America Do you remember Mr Martell?You should have your clothes on Annie. You are quite blue.Well don't fall and hurt yourself. Your mother would never forgive me.Annie!Dearest Hooker. I am one week into the great project and I feel at last that it is real. Its title is \"On the Origin of Species.\" As I write theses words why does it feel as though I am confessing to a murder...What happened?Its not nothing. Why are your knees bleeding?Words are very well. I am asking what happened to her knees.What!Repented what?It is by no means finished. Where is my coat. Its intolerableIn his rights to torture our children for expressing the plain truth.Well damn how he sees it. Damn the pair of them and all their worksEmma please. I will not have Innes tell me what I can and cannot tell my children.You're right of course.... I'm sorry.You're still angry with me.I can always tell by your playing.And say what? She does not want to hear it.That is what I am doing Annie, I am writing all of it.....and then she can read it, and we can all be free of this! Now, please, Annie no more interruptions!Pull!... In time small variations become extreme......Organs change their very function, the oviduct becomes a cement gland.Nothing that need concern you.Pull!....What was once a free- swimming creature now finds itself glued by its head to a rock, flailing for food with its legs...,No of course not. How can there be? If he is supposed to be loving and forgiving - what on earth is the sense punishing all these millions of souls.All what?I don't know what you mean. All what?Pull!He is what? A physician nowNo thank you.Annie? .....Annie.Annie!No. No I am but one of many. There is Squire Lubbock, and the reverend Innes...which no-one has read.Barnacles.How do you do it?Get rid of them.All of them. All of it.Go. Go!God know.A pox on all of them!I will not give it to her.Not to any of mine I hope. On the Beagle I dropped some on a microscope slide and all my animacules died of it.On Madeira they thrived most excellently, as did Captain Fitzroy, while it lasted.I will write to Dr Gully again.I have always found his treatments most effective.Logic is not everything.Parslow will bring your carriage. I will be down presentlyI should take her to Malvern.Gully can care for her properly there. She can be treated daily, as I was.Ha!!By odd meansYes. It is from the Spice islands.You are still young. You could be a missionary and follow in Mr Livingstone's footsteps.Not any more, thank goodnessIt has been finished for me. My correspondent In the spice islands has arrived independently at exactly the same idea, expressed in a mere twenty pages.He does indeed Mr Innes. I was reflecting only the other day on the fact that he has endowed us in his blessed generosity with not one but nine hundred species of intestinal worm each with its own unique method of infiltrating the blood supply and burrowing through the mucosa.And then again on the great love he shows for butterflies by inventing a wasp to lay eggs inside the living flesh of caterpillarsNo. We can leave that for Mr Wallace now. Should I advise him to stay overseas do you think? If he shows his face in Kent he may be required to kneel on rock salt.What? I am forestalled by Mr Wallace. That is the simple fact of it. What reason do you have to be angry?!Annie!No. No. I will not be bled or lectured to.No. Simply the great relief of liberation. Did you read the Wallace abstract....barely half of itYou have been talking to Huxley.I cannot. Seriously Joseph, I am completely blocked. All my old symptoms have returned with a vengeance. The sweats the shakes the abdominal pains. The whole endeavour was cursed from the outset.Not MalvernWhat are you talking about. I have no enemies.You cannot come. How can you possibly come in your condition.It is two days by coach and train. Who will look after the others.Leave us please, Etty.The coach is outside. I will carry her from here.You will see Mamma when you are better. Say goodbye now.Please, EmmaGet aboard. BrodieGo. Go.Go now!Tell him not this way....by the low road.I was persuaded to write book.Poorly.I had the gardener build a water tower. It no longer has any effect.I feared I was dying.Does the exercise of memory count as an action.My eldest daughter. You remember her.I know that. I know.No. It is a scientific text. But I had reached a point, beyond which it was impossible to progress. She had been my companion throughout. Now it seemed she was ahead of me in a place I could not follow.That is what my wife believes. It is a great consolation to herEmma and I have become ...divided on it.We have none ...to speak of.I don't know what it means.Well, until someone devises a machine to read nervous impulses, or a telescope to look inside the body I suppose we can only guess at it.Mrs St John?Sorry. I'm confused. What is it you do exactly.Envision how? When Gully described you I fancied some scientific instrument....Well. I have a ten shilling note here in my wallet.If you can tell me the numbers on it we can begin.I am a professional man. And I asking for no more than I ask of all my colleagues - a demonstration of competence.Then I am sorry to have wasted your time.How dare you....prey on people's grief like this.Do you take me for an idiot? Clearly Gully has appraised you of my history.It is chicanery of the very lowest order and I despise it utterly!Annie. Annie!Is Mrs Carey still the landlady here.My daughter Annie ...lodged here some years ago. Can I come in?I know this is an intrusion. I wonder - could I visit the room she stayed in?Fourteen. I would only be there ten minutes. I am happy to pay.I remember.Is she any better? Does she want for anything?Darling Annie. I am here now.Dearest Emma. I think it best for you to know how every hour passes. It's a relief for me to tell you. Whilst writing to you I can cry tranquilly.Mr Coates the Surgeon came today to draw off Annie's water. This did not hurt her, but she struggled with surprising strength against being uncovered.Save her. I will believe whatever. Forever. Please save herOur dear child has taken a turn for the worse. She talked a great deal but we could seldom make out anything. Much of what she says we cannot make out from the roughness of her poor mouth.Today she vomited rather much again. Dr Coates has been to draw off more water.Is that good, my lovelyGully thinks her in imminent danger.We sponged her with water and vinegar, made her sweet with chloride of lime....I fear we must prepare ourselves for the worstWhat?I don't understand my love.What about her.I don't want to talk about death my love.Well. What the keeper told me was. When she was very sick with pneumonia, lying very still, he tried to feed her but she shook her head, looking at him as though to say: \"Its nice of you but really you shouldn't bother\". And as he bent down to take the spoon away she brought her arms around his neck and kissed him. And then she was dead.Sorry. I startled you.We need to talk. I need to talk to you.I went back to Worcester Road. I saw Annie.Let me tell you.You don't understand.I know that.I know she is dead. I know it. It is you who will not accept the fact, preferring to think of her in heaven.Snowy white wings and dancing with the angels. Is that your idea of honesty.You have to Emma, everything these was between us is gone. The boat is wrecked and sunk now. We have to hold to something else.Open this door Emma. The truth, how wonderful and extraordinary our daughter was....I'm busy Annie.All right, come here, come here.Once there was a man Who, while travelling in South America, came apon a beautiful and dangerous idea.Here, here. Come on, come on then...I wont hurt you.He knew his wife wouldn't care for this creature so when he came home he locked it in a box, where it couldn't run around and do any damage.But every so often he'd open the lid and feed it, just because he couldn't bear to let it die.One day he opened the box and discovered it wasn't in there at all. It had escaped with all its babies, who were nesting all over the house making a terrible mess.But finally they caught them all, and bundled them in a blanket and he asked his wife to dispose of them as she saw fit.I don't know but I fancy she took them out in the garden and set them free.Done. I have finally got it out of the air and into these pages. Will you read it and decide what must be done with it. I confess I no longer know and I am very tired.Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted objects we can conceive directly follow. There is a grandeur in this view of life ...in which endless forms most beautiful and wonderful have been and are being evolved.Emma?Did you read it?And....Dear Hooker, I have today despatched to John Murray the completed manuscript. Who knows if anyone will buy it and how they will respond. No doubt many will wish al diabolo altogether.
