{"Nine": {"GUIDO": {"raw_line": "You kill your film several times, mostly by talking about it. A film is a dream. You kill it writing it down, you kill it with a camera; the film might come to life for a moment or two when your actors breathe life back into it - but then it dies again, buried in film cans. Mysteriously, sometimes, in the editing room, a miracle happens when you place one image next to another so that when, finally, an audience sits in the dark, if you're lucky -- very lucky - and sometimes I've been lucky - the dream flickers back to life again. That's why I'm secretive.Finally, a serious question.Maestro, Maestro, Maestro Contini... How do you begin? How do you begin this thing? Page 1... Page 1... Page 1... Page nothing...Buongiorno, Dante.Bene, grazie, bene.We all have questions for Signor Contini.Is he going to follow us?On my desk.Under my desk. In the trash. Non lo so.Get me a cigarette.Jaconelli -Ascolta me. p. 6Careful what you say. He's a spy from the bank.I need a cigarette.I need a coffee and a cigarette.Actually and an aspirin.That's right: that's directing. And it doesn't seem to make a blind bit of difference, finally, what the answer is...Yes. p. 8Yes, yes. Soon.No.Yes.No. Nobody. Dante. And his spy.Why is there no fire escape in here? What if somebody needed to escape? I can't face these reporters. I have nothing to say.What the hell's wrong with me? I can't sleep. I can't think. I can't write. I can't breathe. My heart is racing. Am I dying, Mamma? I owe you flowers, I know. I'll come to the cemetery at the weekend. You should have let me bury you in Roma, Mamma, I could visit you every week. Don't look at me like that.I miss you.Thanks for coming, everybody.Yes.Actually, it's my shortest title yet.Films are not modest. They cost too much, they take too long, and they involve too many people. So they should have grand titles.Why? I still don't know what my last film was about.Of course I can tell you what my film is about...I can tell you the story, I can tell you who I am going to cast, the music I want to use, I can tell you everything... but... I... won't. I'm afraid that if I say anything, the word might get out to the Press.It sounds fantastic. I can't wait to see it.Stephanie.I'm less interested in the wrapping than what might be inside it.For good?I told Luisa that when we got married I would never again make love to my leading lady.I WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE.You want me to be serious? In a Press Conference?I WOULD LIKE TO BE THEREI thought I was the clown in this circus.I WOULD LIKE TO BE EVERYWHERE AT ONCE I KNOW THAT'S A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS.Flops.AND IT'S A PROBLEM, ESPECIALLY WHEN MY BODY'S NEARING FIFTY AS MY MIND IS NEARING TEN.Excuse me?I CAN HARDLY STAY UP AND I CAN'T GET TO SLEEP, AND I DON'T WANT TO WAKE TOMORROWWhat would you like to see that I haven't already shown you?I AM LUSTING FOR MORE, SHOULD I SETTLE FOR LESS? I ASK YOU, WHAT'S A GOOD THING FOR IF NOT FOR TAKING IT TO EXCESS? ONE LIMITATION I DEARLY REGRET: THERE'S ONLY ONE OF ME I'VE EVER MET.I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ANOTHER ME TOI WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE TO BE THERE ,...OR THE MARQUIS DE SADE. I WOULD LIKE TO BE CHRIST, MOHAMMED,...I WANT TO BE YOUNG, BUT I HAVE TO BE OLD. WHAT I WANT IS A TALE OF SOUND ANDSO ARRANGE IT!THAT'S ALL THAT I WANT! p. 18I need a room.A suite.With a view of the sea. A balcony. Something with air.I've come from Milano.On business. I'm a businessman. Busy busy busy.Please.Why not.Not the flops. I need to see a doctor. Do you know one who's discreet...? I'd like to see him today, in my room, now, if possible.And I need to place a call. To my wife.Luisa, tesoro...Is everybody mad at me?I had to escape from the Press Conference.Don't tease me. I'm sick, Luisa.No, but this time I'm really sick. I can't breathe. p. 21Yes, of course I'm by myself.Yes, please come, that's why I'm calling, please come straight away. That would be wonderful.Great. Marvellous.I don't know, some spa. Horrible. I just kept driving.And, actually, it's hardly worth it. I'll be home in a day or two.But I do wish you were here.I love you.This number - if a woman answers you put it through to my room, otherwise...What?What is she whispering? Is it my blood pressure? Is it serious? Am I dying?Pronto. p. 24It's a very an important call, Doctor. I'm sorry, I have to take it. Private call.What? Yes, yes. It's about my film. It's from the Vatican. Go ahead, Monsignore! Yes, yes, of course, I'm listening.Carla. Carla!Carlissima.Of course.Very happy.Carla, all those bags for the weekend?Carla... I have to tell you... they found out who I am at the hotel--... yes, horrible, but obviously we don't want to be followed by the press, so I found the most charming pensione for you, and it's right here. It's charming.Close the curtains, it's too light in here.Perfect. Now, go into the corridor---Shhh! Yes, count to ten and come back in, and pretend you're in the wrong room, and I'm a complete stranger--I'm here on business.Go, go. Wait. Your face.Get your makeup.Don't move, Carla.Uh-huh.Good for him.Why not?Beautiful. When you come in I want you to be my little savage.Go, go.Hurry, please, Carla.I'll pretend to be asleep.Could you do such a thing?What happened?Come here.What?Carla, just come here. Be savage. Show me.Yes, you have. And I don't have the faintest idea who you are.Page one, page one, page one... The figure emerges from the darkness like a goddess. She is Claudia, his muse...She takes the man's face and kisses him......And with that gesture, he's suddenly inspired to write something... profound.Mother of God, give me a sign.Excuse me, father...His Excellency, the Cardinal, is he -?I would very much like to speak to the Cardinal. Do you think he might grant me -No.I'm in need of some guidance, some pointers...For His Excellency?I'm sure that would be possible...I'm not going to ask how you found me.Oh God.Really? You understand?You're not going to drag me back?Thank you, my old friend. Where are we going?Ciao.No, I remember you. You were, we all enjoyed you, so to speak.Did she like the script? No no no no - impossibile - are you telling me she didn't get the script? Pierpaolo!Claudia didn't get the script! Send her another one. For Chrissake. Send her two!Cretino! Yes, yes, that's what I say, people just don't realise - she's an actress as well as a star - I know Dante's dying to talk to you. A dolpo. Ciao.Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap!What are we doing here?What? No. Oh please God. No. I spoke with her yesterday. She didn't even mention it. Give me a cigarette.What's that?For which scene?Looks like the Folies Bergere. It's wrong. Italian women don't wear those things. p. 37Why did people love that film?I'm trying to find it.Ashtray.Thanks. You were saying - my head is jammed up my ass.Me too.Do you believe in God?So do I.Oh yes, very much so. Not as much as I would like to be, not as much as you would like me to be, I'm sure, but certainly yes, I'm trying.Yes, yes. I will, I will. Your Eminence, I am not happy. I'm searching for something. I feel a sense of misery, of despair and --Excuse me - my films are what I imagine.How do you train the imagination?I can't breathe, I can't breathe.If I die it would kill your husband?I have to go to work. Carla, I can't breathe.It's impossible.Because it's impossible. Please.For the very same reason you don't want me to die on top of you. It's not fair to your husband. It's not fair to my wife. p. 48No.Let's say there were ten sequences, each one set in a different period, but played by the same cast, a man and a woman, a woman and a man... Something light and hectic - like Mozart would do it, like Figaro. Like the circus...Let's try to dig for something else. Maybe a group of people digging, with shovels, in the desert.Luisa!I can't believe you came.The jungle drums exaggerated just a tiny bit.I was dying, until just now. Come.And don't think I forgot your birthday. When you get home, the house will be full of flowers...I hope not. Happy Birthday, my darling. p. 50Let's drink a toast to Luisa's birthday.Happy Birthday.Ah, Don Mario. Excuse me, darling, this is Don Mario. This is my wife, Luisa.Luisa was in that film.It's true. It was your first part.Your name, it's Italian.What have you done before?Waited? For this?Thank you.Thank you. For what I'm looking at. Keep running.Luisa!Luisa - will you please just tell me what happened?What lie?There are plenty of restaurants. p. 56Well you certainly managed to.I didn't know she was here. She just turned up.The only privilege my wife has these days is not having to warn me.Carla, you have to wait outside.I'm in the middle of a working dinner with my colleagues.I'll find someone to escort you home.Apparently she's staying in some grotesque pensione next to the station.Luisa, if I'd invited her here, she would be staying in the hotel, wouldn't she? Think about it. I didn't even know you were coming.Because it's true.It is. Look, she was worried about me, she came to see if I was all right - which yes, is stupid but not, as far as I know, a crime, and hardly a mortal sin.What? What are you laughing about?It's finished. It's finished. If it wasn't before, it is now.Vodka.Yes, I remember very well, Stephanina from Vogue.Amazing. May I take a cigarette?Please.Prego.Really?And what truth is that?I don't think religion is dead. And what exactly is the sexual revolution?Style.Okay.I hate that man.No.I love you Luisa.Can we please try to be close again.Pronto...Is the doctor still with her?I'm here.Thank you. I'm going to stay with her now.Grazie.Carla, I should call your husband.What have you done to yourself? I'm not worth dying for, Carla.Ssshh. You should rest. We'll talk about everything in the morning...Rest, rest. Cara mia...Hold on to me, Mamma. Don't let me wake from this.Yes.Of course. I'm sorry. She loves you, you know that, don't you.Darling?Where's Luisa?I can't.I need help.I'm not cured.I need more time.Okay.Luisa, it's me. Please don't hang up. I want you to be with me in the screening room tonight. I want to talk to you about the casting, about the script. Everything...Otherwise I won't be able to start, I won't know what I'm thinking...Are you there? Luisa?I'm not asking you to let me come home, I just want you to come to the screen test tonight. Not for me, but for the movie. You always have, you always do.Could you turn to the right please, Claudia.And can you turn to the left.Now just one slow turn for us.Bellissima. Brava. Cut.That's fair.That's fair.I'll be back. p. 75I'll be right back.You look ravishing.It's good to see you.Why is everybody so suddenly obsessed with the script?Talk to the people who love you in our films, they're not interested in my script! They're interested in the way you turn your head, the way the camera looks past you to the moon... the way you smile a little as you cry, the way you really do blush for the camera - how?! - who even knows, but whatever else it is, it's not my script.Not a million - you're the muses, the incredible women who made Italy what it is today, a country run by men - who are themselves run by women, whether they know it or not.The great women... p. 77In a way - yes - you have this man in the story and he's, he wants to take hold of everything, to devour everything, he can't let anything go, or, he doesn't want to, and he changes direction every day, because he's lost, he's dying, he's bleeding to death...Exactly! They fall in love with him.What?No, you misunderstand... p. 78She's his inspiration.I fall in love with you every time.No.There was a time once, we were on location, some terrible hotel - and you were in the room directly above me and I could hear you walking about......and, all through the night, I wanted to rush up the stairs and hammer on your door until you opened.I don't know. I don't know.Sure.It meant so much to us all. That you came. p. 83What did you think? Did you like anybody or -? Luisa?What for?What are you talking about?The screen test? You have to understand, it's nothing, this is what I do, I direct. That's my job.What have I done? What have I done, Luisa?I CAN'T MAKE THIS MOVIE, THERE'S NO WAY THAT I'LL BEGIN IT. I CAN'T BEAR TO SEE THE CAMERAS ROLL.THE PROBLEM IS THE AUTHOR'S LOSTI destroyed everything, Mamma......I destroyed everything, I just... you make one wrong turn and then because of that, after it all the turns are wrong. And you are so far from where you wanted to be...and you're lost and then you're lost. p. 87Old friends, I have to come clean with you.There is no movie. I can't pretend anymore. We have to stop. I'm sorry.She seemed so happy. I didn't want to interfere... Is she with anybody?I like to get about without everybody pointing at me.Nowhere. Here. I walk. Just to be able to walk.No, no. Nobody.Don't tease me, Lilli. My heart is -I just miss her. I should have IDIOT tattooed on my forehead.Does she? Did she really say that?No. Never. I've spent this time trying to learn something, Lilli, to not be the person who forgets about everybody else, the person who never grew up. p. 90The only movie I could make now would be... I don't know... would be about a man trying to win back his wife.I can't remember how you do this.I don't want to say too much. The first way that we kill our film is by talking about it. But this scene is about reconciliation. And within the scene I would like you to try and find your way to begin that journey back towards each other.Maybe it's the most important building block that we have to begin again... We start from the beginning each time and I feel today as if I'm starting from the beginning. We'll just keep asking each other questions, and don't look to me for the answers, okay?Yes.ACTION.", "clean_line": "kill film times talking film dream kill writing kill camera film come life moment

Don't speak to him, I speak to him.He's not exactly from the bank, Guido.Not now. He's got the Press Conference.He needs a shirt and tie, Lilli.We're running late...Alright. Two minutes Guido.Silenzio, per favore...Thank you, thank you...I want to say a few words from my heart. I am humbled and thrilled to be able to announce that I am producing Guido Contini's next film, Italia, which will star once again Contini's longtime inspiration, the international film star, Claudia Jenssen......we start shooting in ten days time in Cinecitta. That makes it one week from Monday. Thank you, Maestro, thank you very much. This is our ninth film together. Guido Contini.Our next film will be exactly as it sounds. Italia. It's the very spirit of Italy - Italy as myth, Italy as a woman, Italy as a dream.Guidino!Please - it's my job. A producer needs to know where his director is at all times...even to know the pensione where his mistress is staying...I understand, Guido. Rome is absolutely unbearable. The pressure. It's no good.Of course I understand. Absolutely.No. You're a genius and genius must be served. p. 34You can't be in Rome. Okay.Rome will come to you!It's a fantastic place for you to focus. Everyone is here to help the movie. Everyone is here because they love you, Guido.Guido...you remember Donatella.Donatella, you tested her.Lombardo... p. 36Claudia is going to be amazing.The screenplay is first of all a map. That's a map. p. 49Here she is. At last. Magnificent. You know Donatella?Happy Birthday!We're going back to Rome.Luisa? She's gone. She's had it with you. And quite frankly, so have I. You drag a whole crew up here and then you just disappear. p. 70I can't protect you anymore. And Claudia is in Rome. Makeup tests start today. Remember?You can't. You must. Don't sit down.You've had help. You've seen the doctors, you've seen the priests, you've taken the cure.That's enough! The movie calls, your star has landed. Fausto - take his things please.Guido! Andiamo!Forget the script. Claudia's here now. She'll inspire you to do what you do best, write with your camera. p. 71Tonight. We'll watch everything tonight and make some decisions.Tonight.Claudia!Fair?You've got dailies, Guido.You've got meetings.Great work, Lilli... Wonderful costume......and the hair, makeup, fantastic.Two great profiles.And the back isn't too bad.Fantastic. Guido? Really nice. Who's next?Okay. Let's see the actresses.Well they can keep her.She's peculiar. You don't like her Guido?She's nice.Even better. She's a bit nervous here. What do you say, Guido? Donatella's nice?Who's this? I thought we were looking for a blonde.Very tall.It's not the point. Guido wants the blonde.Shh.She's too beautiful. For my tastes.I don't know what Guido thinks. I think we are happy with Donatella.

She's funny.Guido, she's my friend. I'm not her mother. I don't know. I expect so. Nobody likes to be alone. Promise me you're going to let me cut your hair and get rid of that awful beard. p. 89And where are you getting about?Are you seeing anybody?Well, it sounds exciting.
