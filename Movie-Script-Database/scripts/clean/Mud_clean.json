{"Mud": {"ELLIS": {"raw_line": "I'm comin' out now.Suck it. Drive. The bike spits up mud as they peel out down the trail.A Junior.Nah.I know.I'm not worried about my dad killin' us. THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER sprawls out in front of them. It's enormous. Their boat drifts at the mouth of the Arkansas, a small river by comparison. The Mississippi is a swirling mess of brown water and yellow foam six football fields wide.It ain't gonna sink. We gotta move if we're gonna make it back. Set your watch. We'll need a good fifteen minutes. Neckbone sets an alarm on his fat plastic wristwatch. They take their seats. Ellis cranks the motor. The small boat slowly chugs out onto the massive river.Yeah, there it is. A 26 Foot Long BOAT sits nestled in the tree limbs above.It came down from up there. Ellis points to higher limbs that have long been broken off. Neckbone walks to the back of the boat and hangs his head over. He finds a gaping hole of gutted wood.Who else knows about this?What's he think?Good. Ellis walks to the cabin. He pushes a vinyl door open.'Cause this boat's ours. Ellis has to duck down to go inside. Neckbone follows.This is perfect.Neck.Neck. Ellis reaches for the bread and gives it a squeeze. It's FRESH. Ellis freezes.Someone's here.Someone's livin' here. Neckbone sees the grocery bag. His eyes widen. The boys are stone frozen. They listen for other sounds. Silence.We gotta go. I can't be late.Hold it.Up there. They stop. Neckbone takes the lead, walking up to the last boot print. They appear to vanish.I don't know. Neckbone turns and freezes. A MAN has appeared in the distance behind Ellis. He stands between the boys and their boat. Ellis notices the look on Neckbone's face and turns. He flinches at the sight of the Man. MUD stands near the boys' boat holding a pink, child's fishing pole with cartoon characters on it. He stares back at them and casts his fishing line into the water.I've never seen him before.What's that? Mud takes the cigarette from his mouth. A tattoo of a snake's head covers the top of his right hand. Two large cotton blossoms spill out of its jaws.You talkin' 'bout our boat?No. They watch as he grabs the bait at the end of his line and spits on it. Then, tucking the pole under his arm, he ties a lock of his hair into a knot. He finishes this process with another cast.You got crosses in your heels.What for?DeWitt. Neckbone looks at Ellis, frustrated by his friend.We s'posed to know you?Where around here?You know Shelly's Oxbow? Neckbone can't believe his friend is offering this up.He still does. His boat's cross from mine. Mud smiles.A deal for what?Why don't you go get your own food?When they show up, you'll leave? Mud begins fishing again.And when you leave, that boat's ours?We gotta go. With that, Ellis turns to leave. The boys walk briskly back to their boat. Ellis looks over his shoulder to see Mud making another cast with his fishing pole.You get his name?!I'm sorry.Neck and I got caught up helpin' Galen.I know, I'm sorry.Yessir. Senior flips up the tailgate. Ellis hops up the wheel well and into the bed of the truck. He steadies himself on one of the coolers as his father pulls away.It's s'posed to be ten.You drop me at Neck's? Senior checks his pants pockets, feels around under his seat.Said he had something for me.What'd Momma wanna talk to you about?This mornin', what'd she wanna talk with you about?I wasn't spyin', just heard ya'll.I came by for that book.You said Galen had a book might help me out.Yeah.You know who it is?You tell Galen 'bout this morning?No.Maybe. I don't know. I think he just needed some help.I think I'm gonna go back, take him some food.Thanks. Ellis flips delicately through the manual.I think it's the right thing to do.All right. Neckbone follows his uncle into the trailer. Ellis flips through his new book as he heads out of the trailer park.You okay momma?I'm all right. Mary Lee shuts off the water and lets the dish rest in the sink. She turns to Ellis.Okay momma. Mary Lee slips past him and enters her bedroom. The door closes and Ellis is left alone in the den. It's quiet. He waits, looking at the door his mother just closed. Ellis walks into the kitchen and eases open a cabinet door. Checking over his shoulder, he zips his backpack open and fills it with CANNED FOOD.What do you know about Tom Blankenship?Mr. Blankenship, what do you know about him?I don't know. He looks lonely over there.Yes ma'am. She walks off the boat without a glance in Senior's direction. He trails her with his eyes before going back to digging in the ice. A29 Ellis looks back at Tom. The Walkie SQUAWKS out several A29 loud BEEPS. Ellis crams it in his backpack and runs off the boat.Bye Dad. Senior holds a hand up but never looks up from his work.I guess we should try the boat. They head for the treeline.Looks like he made camp.What're you doin'? Mud bounds down, stepping from limb to trunk to the ground. It's an agile move.I brought you some food. Mud looks at the backpack, but doesn't move.Go on.Yeah.Who's this guy you're waitin' on?What happens if you get bit again?We gotta go help Neck's uncle.You never said your name.Mud?I don't care about that. Ellis watches as the same Skinny Kid from before tries to flirt with her. She's not having it. He pops her bra strap before landing the final straw, a smack on her ass. She turns and swats at him. Seeing this, Ellis is on his feet and crossing the street.Hey. Ellis taps the Kid on the shoulder. As he turns, Ellis PUNCHES him in the face. The Kid, completely taken off guard, stumbles and trips to the ground. Some older, tougher looking GUYS see this and begin laughing at him.He was messin' with you.I'm Ellis. That's Neck. Neckbone waves by wagging a finger in the air.We went to Junior High with you, before you went to High School.Fourteen.So?I know.Nothin'. She smiles.What?No. Did you see her hands?Sorry. We know a guy we think might know that girl.I guess I'll see you.I can find it. May Pearl walks over to her friend. Ellis watches her go, but then remembers Juniper. He turns to Neckbone.Where'd she go?I'm gonna go see if it's her.Wants me to call her.It's her. I saw the tattoos. He wasn't lyin'.What you hidin' for?Yessir. I know.Yessir.What's that mean?What's that mean for me?But you and me can still live out here. Game and fish can't take your boat. Not while you're still in it.But that ain't right. You work outta here. We got the ice machine, the traps. What are we supposed to do?I ain't no townie. I ain't livin' like that. Senior takes a slow pull off the bottle. Ellis' mind races.But ya'll are married. Ya'll are s'posed to love each other.I got you some Beanie Weenie. Mud tucks the pistol into his jeans and accepts the backpack.That's all my mom had.Can I get one of those?I missed my dinner.The girl you're waitin' on, she's your girlfriend?How'd you meet her?Do you love her?From the snake bite.Why aren't ya'll married?My dad says my parents may be gettin' a divorce.If it happens, and my mom moves us off the river, they say the government can come take our boat away.Everybody. They passed a law so you can't sell your boat. Can't rent it. If the owner leaves, they got you. Game and Fish want `em off the river.I saw Juniper today.I didn't talk to her, but she had the birds tattooed on her hand like you said. You were right. She's pretty. Mud stands, surprised by the news. He walks to the other side of the fire so his back is to the boy.At the Piggly Wiggly. I think she's stayin' at a motel by there. The Executive Inn. Mud looks at Ellis through the fire. He takes a drag and smiles at the boy. The hole from his missing tooth shows.Does she know you're out here?You wanna go tonight? I can give you a ride up river. Mud looks at Ellis, nodding.You need me to come get you?It's Saturday.What do you wanna talk about? You want to leave and that means they can tear up our house.No.What'd he do?! The Trooper bends back down and looks at Ellis.Neck! Neck, pick up!My mom and I were headed to Wal- Mart on 165. There was a roadblock with state troopers. They searched our car and showed us a picture of Mud. They're lookin' for him.No.No. That's why I called you. We gotta warn him.He's goin' to get Juniper today. I went out there last night and told him where we saw her. He needs to know people are lookin' for him.He loves her Neck. He told me.He's not dangerous. Reluctantly, Neckbone throws his leg into the boat.He may already be gone.What are you doin'?So you know about the state troopers? He looks up from his notebook.Why?I need to hear about it. Mud sits up. He looks at Ellis, deciding how much to tell.Where were you?You did it for her? To protect her?Tom Blankenship? Mud has smoked down to the filter. He crushes the butt into his palm and puts it back in his shirt pocket.I know where he lives, but I've never spoke to him.You comin'?What?I ain't huntin you.I came to find you. I got a message for you.Yessir.It ain't from him. Ellis, not wanting to follow further, shouts from the planks.Yessir.He asked me to come get you. Tom straightens his back. He looks into the woods, searching for something he may have missed.No sir. Mud needs your help. Tom's mind churns on a series of facts unknown to the boy.There he is. Tom spits onto the muddy bank and makes his way toward Mud. Ellis and Neckbone stay by the boat and watch.I don't know.You all right? Mud raises his head.Yeah.I can handle it. Ellis steps forward and Mud hands over the note. Ellis takes it and walks back to the others.What do you think?I told him I would. Neckbone thinks about this seriously, shakes his head.You still got that trailer you made for your bike?I say we start at the top, work our way down.We're sellin' fish. You wanna buy some?I don't...I...Yeah.Mud sent us to give this to you. Juniper is stunned. She looks at the bag, then at the boys.I think it's a couple days. He wants to get a boat for ya'll.We won't.We'll be all right. Keep your door locked. We'll be in touch. Ellis heads to the door as Neckbone gathers up the cooler.I'm Ellis. That's Neckbone.Lock the door. She smiles. The door slams shut. The room number, 212, stares Ellis in the face. He takes a deep breath.Hello? Is May Pearl there?...This is Ellis...Hey, it's Ellis. Hey... What?...In the phone book... from his car commercials...I think they're all right...Tomorrow? Yeah, I can meet you... Okay. Bye. Ellis hangs up the phone. With the peas pressed firmly against his face, he smirks.Yeah. Ellis turns and Mud sees his black eye for the first time.We came up on Juniper's room. A guy was in there beatin' up on her. Mud's face turns dark.I don't know. Tall. Looked like a cowboy.Yeah.Yeah.I'm not stupid. Ellis takes the pulley and scales the trunk without hesitation. Mud tosses his pocket knife to Neckbone.What'd you mean when you called Tom an assassin?Thanks.You make up your mind?About leavin' dad. Mary Lee thinks about how to answer, shuts off the radio.Not really. Ellis takes a sip from the Sonic cup. His face puckers.I guess. You got a lot of friends.I bet you're pretty popular.I don't know. `Cause you're nice to people.You're nice to me.I got this for you. He removes a bracelet made from the pearls he collected off Galen's porch. May Pearl takes it, begins putting it on.Neckbone's uncle caught the pearls. I thought with your name and everything...You wanna be my girlfriend? She smiles, then kisses him.I don't drink coffee. Ellis waits for a moment, but realizes this is Tom's way of inviting him inside. He enters.No.He's okay.He called you an assassin. Tom snorts out a laugh, sips his coffee.Is it true?Few days.So it's not true.Yeah I guess. Tom notices the boy's disappointment.I don't know.Yeah.Because he hurt Juniper.I gotta go. Ellis heads for the door, but stops short.You're wrong about Juniper. They love each other and they're gonna make it. If you weren't a wore out old man you'd know it was true. Tom eyes the boy, taking a sip from his cup. He nods a goodbye to Ellis who is already out the door.I got more stuff.Not yet. What's that?Why?Helpin' his uncle with a dive.Tom called me over to his place this mornin'.He was runnin' down Juniper. Ellis looks for a response, but Mud just jumps up into the boat and starts throwing pieces of wood on shore.I told him he was a wore out old man. Told him he couldn't know how much you loved Juniper.I don't care.I gotta go help my dad. Mud turns back but doesn't stop moving.A kid in town. He got his too.`Bout a girl.My girlfriend.Yes sir.Other day. Senior pats his shirt pocket and finds a smoke. Lights it.No.I'm talkin'. I'm talkin' to both of you. That's all ya'll want to do is talk.A little.Thanks. Ellis walks up and knocks a stack of bricks off the trailer.We could take it apart. Bring it out piece by piece.With what?Yeah.I think so.What?I don't know.No.We still need a motor.It's true. He built his own dirt bike.I don't know. That motor's worth somethin'. It's not like this other junk.I wanna talk to room 212.Juniper?It's me.Yeah. It's time to take you out to him.Tomorrow. We'll come get you.He's got a plan for ya'll to get away. Be ready tomorrow at five. Neckbone'll be waitin' at the back of the motel with a dirt bike.I'll take care of that. Just be ready at five.It's okay. He's got the boat. We helped him fix it up. It's a good plan. Just be ready.What do you mean?Cause ya'll love each other. Juniper searches for a comment. Ellis, looking out over the parking lot, sees May Pearl getting out of a car with her MOTHER and SISTER.I'll see you tomorrow.We're good.We don't want your money. Carver steps in close to the boys.No. Carver removes a flier with Mud's picture and holds it out.I'm sure.No. Carver smiles. He tucks the flier and the forty dollars into Ellis' hand.I don't know.Take your bike around the side. I'll check her room. We'll just have to hope no one sees us. Neckbone cranks the bike and speeds toward the motel. Ellis looks to the motel, then the parking lot.Nothin'. Ellis notices the front officeCome on.Scuse me, sir?We're lookin' for the girl in room 212. You seen her?You see her today.It's gotta be.We're gonna have to tell Mud. Neckbone drops his head, nods reluctantly.Just leave it. Mud'll have to help get it.I'll just tell him the truth.We got that motor.Yeah.She didn't meet up with us.It wasn't Carver. Mud straightens up, prepares for the news.She was supposed to meet us on the side of the motel. She never showed up. We went asking for her. The motel clerk told us she went to a bar out on 61.We tracked her down. She was there with another guy.She knew the plan Mud. She just didn't show up.They were playin' pool. Drinkin'. He was close up on her. They were laughin'. He kissed her on the neck. Mud nods.What do you want us to do?Tom left this for you. They slowly retreat into the woods and disappear. Mud turns back to the campfire and shoves the pot into the ashes. His eyes, soft and red, reflect the flame.You think it's all right to leave him alone?!Hello? Is May Pearl there...This is Ellis...I called yesterday, you give her my message?...My name is Ellis. I'm her boyfriend...Oh, she's asleep...I said she's asleep? The front door flies open. Senior storms headlong toward Ellis. He shouts.I don't know what you're sayin'.We didn't steal it.We thought it was junk. We didn't think it was worth anything.I'm not a thief.Stop it dad.I can't take that motor back. But I'll pay him for it. I'll pay him what he wants for it. Senior, stoic, pivots his body away from the boy.It's a bonfire.He had something else on his mind. Come on. Ellis leads Neckbone into the treeline.We found your shirt. Ellis tosses it to him. Mud tosses it back.We saw what's left of your bonfire.You do some drinkin' last night?Okay Mud. Ellis takes the letter. Mud goes back to the boat motor. He motions to Neckbone to join him.You still takin' Juniper?Yeah. What about you?Can I borrow your bike? Neckbone fishes the key out of his pocket. Hesitates.Hello. I saw the guy you're lookin' for...Yeah, he's crazy lookin'. Saw him at the Wal-mart outside of Gillet. He was buyin' some beanie weenie...'bout five minutes ago.I'm supposed to give this to you. Juniper takes the letter.No. I gotta go.All you had to do was be there.Then why'd you even come here?I know he'd do anything for you. She puts her cigarette out in a Coke can on the floor.What's it say?You get my phone calls?I've been callin' you. Who's this guy?I called you twice yesterday. Your sister didn't tell you? Kyle slings the door open knocking Ellis to the pavement. From the ground, Ellis can see that Kyle is big and considerably tougher than the skinny kid he punched before. Kyle's friends from other cars take notice and begin to converge on them. Ellis makes a move for Kyle's legs but is kicked back to the pavement. Kyle straddles him on the ground and punches him. Another punch to Ellis' face. May Pearl is out of the car and yelling.What?I'm sorry, I just wanted to know why you hadn't called me back.Because you're my girlfriend. The crowd is watching.We kissed.Yeah but...I love you.Don't. Wait. We can make this work. We can figure it out. I love you.What are you doing? Ellis watches as dresses and blouses begin to shrivel up in the flames.Stop it! That's mom's stuff! STOPYou're a liar. Makin' two kids run around doin' work you're too scared to do yourself. Makin' me tell her it's over `cause you're too scared to do it yourself. Mud steps back and gives the boy his space. Neckbone has made his way over and watches from behind Mud.You said you loved her and you lied. You gave up on her and she gave up on you just like everybody else. I trusted you. Bonfires and crosses. Wolf's eye bullshit. Mud tries to approach him but the boy explodes, shoving him.You made me a thief! Ellis walks back into the woods. Mud exhales and turns back to Neckbone.Where am I?How'd I get to the doctor?No. Senior gently pats her shoulders.Okay. Senior leads Mary Lee to the door.Mom? Dad? They turn back.I love ya'll.Mud?How'd you get here?You did?Good.Me too.I'm sorry `bout what I said.I know.She loves you too. She said it. This fact still strikes Mud. He nods.My dad says you can't count on women lovin' you. He says you can't trust it.You're a good man too Mud. Mud smiles.Mud?!Yeah.You got your bike back.It's the law.No. He's gone.Said he couldn't watch it. He's pickin' me up in a minute. Got deliveries today. They sit in silence as the Workers exit off the houseboat.I don't know. I hope not. The crane begins lifting up the houseboat. The metal wires tighten and the entire structure creaks. A sucking sound as the flotilla separate from the water. The boat hangs, suspended in the air. A HORN HONKS behind the boys. Ellis turns to see Senior's truck.I gotta go. Come by the apartment. Help me set my room up.I'll see you next week?Yessir.Love you too.", "clean_line": "comin suck drive bike spits mud peel trail junior nah know worried dad killin mississippi river sprawls enormous

nice titties. You talk to her?You're gonna have to talk to her.Remind me when we get back to my house, Galen's got a book on that. Neckbone takes a spot up front in the small, flat-bottom boat. Ellis, a foot on the bank and one in the boat, launches them out into the water.Shit. Ellis raises up behind him. He takes a deep breath, nods.Your dad'd kill us he knew we went out there.What if it sinks?Galen thinks it's been here awhile. Thinks the last flood did it. Ellis follows as Neckbone winds through the trees. They stop at a deep creek that cuts across the island. Neckbone looks to his right, then his left. Sees what he's looking for.It's down there. A fallen tree trunk that straddles the creek. Ellis starts across.Hold it. Neckbone picks a large stone up off the ground.Look. Eight feet below the tree trunk, a nest of water moccasins curl around in the creek. Neckbone drops the stone on top of them. The snakes fan out.Little shits. Their mud-caked high-tops stomp across the trunk.So there it is.Motor broke off. Ellis isn't concerned with the motor. His eyes are locked on a covered cabin at the front of the boat.Just me and Galen.He don't care about it.It's got its own shitbox Neckbone slides back a portion of floral curtain and light streams in. He starts opening small closets and drawers. Ellis plops down on the rotted bench cushions.Ho-Lee-Shit. Neckbone stares in an open drawer. He removes a stack of Playboys from the 1980's. Ellis smiles at him. He leans back and props his foot against the sink cabinet across from him. This is home. Neckbone opens the first Playboy. It disintegrates.Aw shit.Her tits are so small. Ellis reaches out and traces his finger in the groove of the cross marking. His eyes narrow as he re-surveys the cabin. On the table across from the toilet, he notices several empty cans of Beanie Weenie. In the booth, he sees a grocery bag. Ellis slowly raises up and goes over to it.Look at that beave. You gotta see this. Ellis reaches out for the plastic bag. His fingers pull back the edges to reveal its contents: one can of unopened Beanie Weenie and half a loaf of BREAD.What?What? Ellis holds the loaf of bread up to Neckbone.Shit.What are you doing? Ellis stares at a muddy boot print, cross in the heel, stamped in the center of their boat. He looks back to the treeline, then down the shore. He looks to his feet. The boys' shoe prints make chaotic patterns in the mud. Larger boot prints lead off down the shoreline.What is it?Shit. Let's go. Ellis begins following the boot prints around the shoreline.We gotta go if you wanna make it back.Where the hell'd he go?Shit. You know that guy?Shit. Mud, not taking his eyes off the boys, slowly reels in his line. His hair is a wild mop that leads to two weeks of growth on his face. With a cigarette clinched, he cracks a smile revealing a MISSING CANINE. He holds a hand in the air as if to wave.Shit. Neckbone slowly raises his hand up to wave back. Mud wears jeans and cowboy boots. His filthy button-up shirt looks like it hasn't left his body in years. He breaks his stare with the boys. Continuing to reel in his line, he walks over to them.We found it.So?I'm Neckbone, he's Ellis, and mister you may be stone ass crazy but I know you're not the owner of that boat, not for nine tenths of nothin'.What do you care where we're from?Ellis. We gotta go.This guy's a bum Ellis. Come on. Mud's smile vanishes. Neckbone begins to walk off but begrudgingly stops when Ellis starts back in.He's a bum Ellis, let's go. Mud lays a serious look down on Neckbone.No! Ellis looks back. Mud has disappeared.What book?Aw, yeah. We gotta give it a minute. You hear that music?That means he's doin' it. That's his doin' it song. Ellis takes a seat next to Neckbone. They listen to the song, slightly craning their necks to pick up on any other sounds. There are none.Whoever's drivin' that white Dodge. Neckbone motions to a beat up Dodge Shadow in the yard.Nah. You tell anybody?That guy was crazy.Well he can swim his ass off that island and get some.Why? Suddenly, the music from inside stops. Footsteps approaching and the trailer door flies open, almost hitting the boys. A GIRL bursts out down the steps, straight to her car. She wears tight jean-shorts and is buttoning a white shirt. She stops and turns back to the boys.Yeah.Yeah. The trailer door opens and GALEN emerges. He's a big, lumbering guy wearing a full-body wet suit pulled halfway down. A faded mermaid tattooed in the middle of his chest.Pearls. Galen finds 'em in some of the mussel shells. Most of 'em ain't worth dick, but he likes to make necklaces for the girls. Come on, let's get that book. Neckbone walks into the trailer. Ellis stands up and retrieves the other two pearls out of the dirt. He crams them in his pocket and follows Neckbone inside.I don't want you goin' back out there by yourself. That river's scary enough with two people, and I don't trust that guy.Galen said this really turned things around for him.You really going back out there?Well...I'll be over in the mornin' then. Galen, his thumbs tucked under his armpits, walks back to the trailer. He passes the boys and notices the self-help book in Ellis' hands.I'll call 'fore I come.Where you think he's at?You think he's up there?What you got that pistol for? Mud wipes off his chin, realizing the boys have been studying him. He closes the knife and tucks it in his pocket.Is she hot?That a good luck snake?I hate snakes.Thanks. So what's that for then? Mud walks to a tree branch that has grown out over the bank, nearly resting in the water. He sets a trot line from it.What'd they do?Here you go, Mud. I think you need that worse than I do.You start datin' I bet her dad'll give you a free pick-up truck.What's goin' on? Ellis doesn't turn back. Neckbone reluctantly sets the carburetor down and follows.Son of a bitch...Ellis? Ellis breaks away from his conversation with May Pearl.Look. Neckbone nods to a cheap motel called the EXECUTIVE INN located on the opposite side of the Piggly Wiggly parking lot. JUNIPER , a truly beautiful woman squeezed into tight jeans and a low cut top, makes her way from the motel parking lot to the Piggly Wiggly. She passes in front of the cluster of Teenagers. All of the boys have taken note. Some cat calls from the crowd. Juniper, without facing the Teenagers, gives them the finger.You ever seen that girl before?Into the Piggly Wiggly. She came from the motel.I gotta go check on Galen. We'll pick you up out front. Ellis heads for the Piggly Wiggly. Neckbone calls after him.What'd she say?Shit.Was it her?So what's the big deal?I knew it! I told you that crazy sonofabitch was trouble. Did they say what he did?So'd you tell `em where he is?What?You think he doesn't know that already? Jesus Ellis, why do you think he's on that island? You don't even know what he's wanted for. Ellis climbs in the boat and Neckbone yanks his shoulder.Ellis! I'm serious. We don't know who this guy is.I don't give a shit who he loves. Ellis starts the motor and waits for his friend.It sounds like a shitload of state troopers think different.No tellin' where the hell he's been sleepin'.The ones spreadin' your picture all over the place. Stoppin' cars on 165 searchin' for your ass. Mud factors this in and then goes back to writing.Who'd you kill?I think you want us to run around, stickin' our necks out, gettin' everything you need, just so you can take our boat.What do we get out of it?What about that pistol? Mud eyes the boy, pulling on the nub of cigarette.What kind is it?I guess we could work a deal like that. Neckbone steps forward to grab the pistol, but Mud puts it back in his jeans.All right then.Don't lose my pistol. They continue down the rope. Mud continues his work.I'll watch the boat. Ellis scans the woods that populate the patch of land wedged between the river and this short tributary.Ellis?Be careful. Galen always said that old man's crazy. Neckbone keeps his seat as Ellis darts into the woodsYou think that's his dad?They don't look like family. Ellis watches Mud as he gestures and speaks. He seems different. Younger. Mud stops talking. Tom scratches a hand through his white crew cut. He begins pointing a finger at Mud. His face is flushed and the sound of his voice carries to the boys, though still unintelligible.He's really givin' it to him.You Mud's daddy?He loves her. You can tell that much. You gonna take it to her?I don't know. Could be a lot of trouble.All right. They each grab an end of the cooler and carry it across the lot toward a flight of stairs.We're just selling fish! Carver sizes things up. It takes a moment, but he settles. He snorts out a laugh and drops Ellis on the ground. Carver turns his attention back to Juniper, who is huddled up in the corner of the motel. Carver walks over to her. Opening a good-sized knife, he gets down in her face and holds the blade uncomfortably close to her cheek.You all right?He popped your eye. Ellis holds the back of his hand up to his eye which has begun to swell. The cut trickles blood over his cheekbone. Juniper moves to the sink. Ellis sits up, staring at her back.Yeah we met him. Juniper takes the bag. She removes the letter and takes a seat on the edge of the bed to read it. Ellis watches her eyes move along the paper. She smiles, which makes Ellis smile. After a moment, she folds it up.Yeah, we read it. Juniper raises her eyebrows at Neckbone.We gotta go. Ellis turns and grabs one end of the cooler. Neckbone slaps back the security latch and opens the door with his free hand. They walk out.Let's go hard on. He and Ellis wrangle the cooler down the steps. The sun set while they were inside. A blue hue hangs over everything.We've got more, but no motor.Ellis rushed him. Got smacked for it.More what? Mud gathers the supplies and heads to the treeline. The boys, with their hands full, follow him.What's so special `bout that shirt you'd lose your pistol for it?He said he wasn't your daddy.I never met my parents.My uncle Galen tells me things about `em. He's the one that takes care of me.Well if you're gonna do it do it! Mud takes a deep breath and yanks the cord. Angled on one of the main branches holding up the boat, Mud begins cutting. Ellis and Neckbone step further and further back as they watch the chainsaw work through the thick limb. Suddenly, the chainsaw stops. A deep CRACKING sound. The huge branch SNAPS, tumbling off lower limbs before crashing to the ground. Mud holds onto the trunk for dear life. The branch now rests on the ground, SILENCE. The ropes and pulleys hang taught, squeaking from the weight of the boat. Mud slowly lifts his head up. He smiles at what he sees. The rigging has held.This shit is crazy.That's a good haul.Yeah.Tell you what?I can tell you this helmet smells like my duck butter.You touch her breast?That's great man.It's welded. We'd just tear it up. What if we float it out?Come on. Neckbone walks to the trailer. Ellis follows.Jesus! They squint and shield their eyes. The light shuts off as quickly as it came on. Galen stands in front of them wearing his wet suit. The bar with the flood lights attached sits across his shoulders. The boys rub their eyeballs, seeing spots. Galen shuffles over to the couch holding a marine battery connected to the lights. He labors to take a seat.That's real good Galen.We got stuff to do.What were ya'll talkin' about?There's a motor in the scrap yard might work.I can get it runnin'. Tell him Ellis.It's been there for months. Nobody's even gonna know it's gone. Ellis hesitates. He looks to Mud.How'd it go?Gimme a quarter. This shit took mine. Ellis watches May Pearl entering the grocery store. He calls out with a wave.It's all right man. She's with her family. Come on. I wanna get that motor before dark. They head to the dirt bike.That'd bout do it.Jesus that's heavy. The boys get on either side of the motor and begin half- dragging it back to the fence line.Where are those bastards?What do you wanna do?Shit. Was she there?You think this is it?Thanks a lot asshole!I'll take you home.What're you gonna tell him?I doubt it! Neckbone sees Ellis' concern.I'll sleep over at your house tonight! We can check on him first thing tomorrow! Ellis nods. As they head further up river, the island grows smaller, silhouetted by the moonlight.What the hell's all this?I guess he didn't care about bein' seen. Ellis kicks at one of the burned logs. He bends down and finds the bottle of Jack Daniels, smashed.You be all right?He'll be okay.Don't tump it. Ellis nods. Neckbone walks over to Mud with the toolbox. Letter in hand, Ellis gives a final look toward Mud's labor and walks back into the woods. On his way, he stops to hang Mud's shirt on a tree branch.Try it now. Mud turns a switch. No result.Sonofabitch. Ellis emerges from the treeline. Mud sees him and hops down from the boat. He walks up to him.Let me talk to him.Ellis! Ellis, stop for a second! Neckbone watches as Ellis reaches the tree trunk that bridges the creek. Ellis steps onto the log, but his muddy shoes miss a step. He SLIPS. Neckbone sees Ellis disappear down into the creek bed.IS HE OKAY?! Is he bit?! Mud notices Ellis' jeans leg riding up. He pulls the jeans back. A BITE in the middle of his calf. It's a bluish bruise with two distinct red dots. The skin around the bite has already begun to swell.It's four eighteen! Mud draws a line on Ellis' leg just above the swollen bite. He writes, \"418\".Is he gonna be okay?!Yeah!Yeah!Are you bit?! Mud shakes his head.My bike should be just over that ridge! Mud looks at Ellis' leg. The swelling has crept up his thigh. Black lines with numbers mark its progress: \"428, 438, 448\". Ellis' face has taken on a blue tint.It ain't sunk yet. Mud smiles. He holds out his hand, which Neckbone slaps.I wish Ellis could see it.Where the bullets?Shit. Neckbone begrudgingly crams the pistol into the back of his pants.Hey.Mud dinged the shit out of it. Neckbone takes a seat next to Ellis. They watch the workers.They're really doin' it.It's bullshit. They ever find Tom? The boys focus on Tom Blankenship's boat across the bayou. It sits vacant, covered in police tape.Your dad not here?Heard on the news. They still hadn't found Mud's body. Ellis nods.You think he's dead?All right. Neckbone watches Ellis climb into the bed of the pick-up and take his spot on the coolers. The sound of twisting metal shifts his attention back to the houseboat being swung over a flatbed semi.", "clean_line": "shit man old got nice titties talk gonna talk remind house galen got book

flatbed semi"}, "MUD": {"raw_line": "What you say? The boys don't respond. Mud walks past them and casts again.Helluva thing.Boat in the trees. It's a helluva thing. Mud continues walking down the shoreline, reeling in his bait. The boys follow, tentatively.I'm talkin' about my boat.You found it with me livin' in it. Possession is nine tenths of the law.Don't tell me you boys are from Mississippi?Nails. Shaped liked crosses.Ward off evil spirits. A man I called an Indian but was Meskin said they were Seven-league boots worn by the seventh son of a seventh son. Told me it'd turn me into a werewolf but that's a lie. I don't know nothin' about that. Ellis, confused, won't take his eyes off the man.They just good luck, but so far they ain't been workin' too well. What's your name? Mud seems easy to smile, which softens his otherwise coarse look. His words spill from the mouth rapidly, without much thought for punctuation. Neckbone, emboldened by these facts, steps forward to answer.Neckbone? That's a real handle son. Where ya'll from?Arkansas boys. Ya'll had me worried for a second. Mud, pleased by this news, tucks the fishing pole under his arm and holds out a hand to shake. Ellis stares at the hand, unsure. He takes it reluctantly.I doubt it. I grew up `round here, but I've been gone awhile.Different places. Spent a lot of time back up near the White.I know it. Guy named Tom Blankenship used to live back in there.Ain't that somethin'. In one motion, Mud flicks his cigarette away and grabs a pack out of his shirt pocket.I like you two. You remind me of me. And seeing how you boys are from Arkansas and we know some people and sounds like we all from the same place I'd say we can make a deal here about somethin'.Food. Food for a boat.I would if I could, but I told somebody I'd meet `em here. So I'm stuck for now and what I got's runnin' low. Neckbone walks back and pulls Ellis by the arm.I'm no bum. I got money. You can call me a hobo `cause a hobo'll work for his living and you can call me homeless `cause that's true for now, but if you call me a bum again I'll have to teach you somethin' about respect that your daddy never did. Neckbone's confidence recedes. Ellis stands his ground.Yeah.Yeah. Ellis studies Mud's face, clothes, tattoos. He's thinking about it. Mud pauses from fishing to make eye contact.I'm in a tight spot. I just need a little help.I didn't know if ya'll'd come back. The boys spin around. They survey the woods but no one's there. Their eyes drift up to find Mud sitting in a tree, his legs dangle off a branch.I try to never sleep in the same place twice. What you got there? Mud motions with his head to the backpack in Ellis' hand. Ellis holds it out to him.I owe you boys. Keeping the bag in hand, Mud takes a seat on the stump behind him. He pulls out a selection of canned food; pumpkin pie filling, evaporated milk, green beans. He grabs the beans.I was gonna try runnin' a trot line today. See how far that'd get me. Mud removes a good-sized folding knife from his pocket and makes short order of the can lid. He tips the can up letting the beans fall into his mouth. Juice flows down his cheeks.I appreciate it.For protection. Mud gets up, heads for a duffel bag tucked under a nearby tree. The boys pivot, keeping Mud in front of them. Mud notices.Ya'll don't have to be afraid of me. I have two ways to protect myself out here. This shirt, and this pistol.There are fierce powers at work in the world boys. Good, evil, poor luck, best luck. Men have to take advantage where they can. Mud removes a spool of fishing line and a small plastic tackle box. He scoops up the duffel bag and heads into the woods.Ya'll comin'? Neckbone looks to Ellis, who walks after Mud into the trees.I'm not waitin' for a guy. I'm waitin' on my girlfriend. Juniper.She's beautiful.Best lookin' girl I've ever seen. Hands down. Blonde hair. Long legs. She's like a dream you don't want to wake up from. She's got birds tattooed on her hands, here. Mud stops, points to the area on the top of his right hand, between his thumb and pointer finger.Nightingales. Good luck birds.No it is not.That's because God made them for us to fear.It's a thing we knew to be afraid of before we even got into this world. They emerge from the woods onto the downstream coast of the island. It looks different than the other shoreline. A large swath of red clay angles sharply into the water.Cherokee would wrap snake skin around their pregnant women's bellies. Induce labor, scare the child out. Here. He fetches a length of rope out of the duffel bag and tosses it to Neckbone.Set that `round your bed at night. Snake won't cross braided rope.A reminder. Don't get bit. I was 10, swimmin' `bout a mile up from here. Me and Juniper. Sonofabitch swam right up under me, bit me just below the armpit. June got me out, got me to a clinic. Doctor said I shoulda been dead in twenty minutes. Took us an hour just to get back to town.Gave me antivenom. For a cotton mouth. See here. Mud shows the tattoo on top of his right hand. He points out the two cotton blossoms bulging from the snake's mouth.Problem with antivenom is they can only give it to you once. It's made from horse blood. Your body would reject it a second time. The cure ends up being more dangerous than the poison.I die, or just sweat it out. Neckbone, not buying it, looks at Ellis and taps his watch.All right.Mud. You can call me Mud.Ellis? Ellis, still frozen, slowly turns to him. Mud huffs out a laugh and drops the pistol to his side.What're you doin' out here? Ellis slowly raises the backpack in his hand.I appreciate that, but I didn't expect you out here at night. Mud takes a seat on the log and transfers the cans into his own duffel bag. He holds up a can of the Beanie Weenie.Look at that. You really know how to do somebody right. I didn't wanna say anything before, but it's hard to make a meal out of pumpkin pie filling.I'm not complainin'.They're yours to begin with. Ellis sits as Mud hands him a can. They eat.That's good right?Juniper. Yeah.We grew up together.I do. The first time I saw her was on this river. Just up from here. She saved my life.That's right. I was younger than you are now, but when I came to in the hospital and she was there, it was like the world split open, came back together new. Everything changed. I knew from then on I'd do anything for her.I've asked. Several times. Marriage just doesn't work for some people. Ellis thinks on this.I'm sorry to hear that.Who says that?I've never been one to trust the government on matters of personal property, but if your parents love each other, there's always a chance.People just sometimes forget why they fell in love in the first place. Ellis watches Mud toke the cigarette nub. He's really getting all he can from it.What?Where'd you see her?That's good news. Real good news. Mud paces, slowly. He's thinking.No. We picked another place to meet. Couple days from now. Mud walks back to the log and sits.Tomorrow. I'll go tomorrow.Naw. I can manage. Hell I got out here didn't I? Ellis smiles. They sit in silence. Ellis stares up at the boat hanging over them, its peeling hull lit by the firelight. Mud pinches the ash from the end of his cigarette, places the stub back in his shirt pocket. Noticing Ellis, Mud tilts his head back to take in the boat.It's a helluva thing. Mud pauses, his mind working on something.Helluva thing. The two sit by the campfire staring up at the suspended boat.Hey! The boys look straight up. Mud leans over the edge of the boat above them.Up here! Mud drops them a rope with knots tied in it. Ellis starts inching his way up. Neckbone begrudgingly follows.I'm gonna have to go back on our deal for the boat. I don't feel good about it, but I don't see any other way outta what I'm into. Neckbone makes his way on board. Mud has pulled a panel off the steering column. Exposed wires dangle.What state troopers?I didn't know about that, but it doesn't surprise me. There plenty of folks lookin' for me right now.I shot a man. Killed him.I'm sorry I didn't tell ya'll sooner, but I was hopin' to be gone before anything came of it. Didn't want you involved. Mud turns to really face them for the first time.Ya'll have been real good to me. You're the only friends I got out here. If the state troopers have 165 blocked, they'll have others blocked too. I won't get anywhere in a car. I want to try takin' this boat down, see if we can get it in the water. Ellis and Neckbone stand their ground. They don't say anything. Mud walks back to the steering column. He drops to his knees and fiddles with the wires.With a boat like this I can make it to the gulf in two days. I could get anywhere from there. But I'd need a boat at least this big to make it on open water. It's got no title, no owner, nobody lookin' for it. It's my best shot.It was a bad piece of business. Ya'll don't need to hear about it.Juniper made a mistake. She hooked up with a guy. He was no good. His name was Hutchins. Family owns a chain of restaurants down in Texas.I was around, but me and Juniper were on the outs. She met this Hutchins, he sold her on some lies. Got her pregnant. That's when he started showin' who he really was. He dropped June down a flight of stairs after whoopin' her half to death. She lost the baby. He made it so the doctors think she can't have children anymore. There're things you can get away with in this world and things you can't. I tracked him down at a motel just outside of San Antonio. He was there with another woman. That's where it happened. Mud's done with his story. He goes back to the wiring.I understand if you can't help me anymore, but I need this boat. And I need to get it in the water fast. After a moment, he sits up and wipes sweat from his forehead.I've made a list. Things we'll need. What do ya'll think? Ellis takes time to consider everything. He looks at Neckbone, who has a disgruntled look on his face.Yeah. Ellis nods. Mud looks over at Neckbone, who still has the disgruntled look on his face.What do you think?That's about it. Mud removes a cigarette butt and sparks it with a lighter.What do you want? Neckbone looks to Ellis, judging his bargaining position.I only got two things out here worth anything. This shirt... Mud pulls the pistol from the back of his jeans. Neckbone tenses, but relaxes when Mud splays it out on an open palm.And this pistol. I can't give you the shirt `cause I need it for protection, but if you help me get this boat in the water, the pistol's yours. Neckbone squinches his face in thought, sizing up this trade.A forty five.We get this thing floatin' first. Neckbone looks over at Ellis, who shrugs.Ya'll scrounge what you can off this list, but if we're gonna get this done right we'll need more help. Can you fetch Tom for me?I was hopin' to let that old assassin stay put, but we'll need him to get things ya'll can't. Can you find him?Just tell him my name. He'll know you're serious. Ellis folds the list up. He and Neckbone start down the rope as Mud goes back to the wiring.Boys?Sir. They stare at each other for a long moment. Neither one flinching.In town. Got here yesterday. Tom lowers his head. Frustrated.I ain't no thief.Looks like we're on our own. He stands and takes a folded piece of paper from his shirt.I didn't want you bein' the one to do this, but I can't see a way around it. I need to get this letter to Juniper. Could you take it to her for me?You have to be careful. You can't just walk up and knock on her door, you hear me? You have to watch yourself.This'll work for now. You get her my note?Where'd you get that from?What'd he look like?Dark hair?Thanks for lookin' after her. Ellis nods. Mud picks up the rope.His name's Carver. Brother of the man I shot. If he's here, then more are comin'.Bounty hunters. Carver's rotten, but his daddy's the one to be scared of. He'll spend all the money he has to see me dead. If it was up to me I'd put the whole family down same as the other. Not a decent man between `em. Mud stops and turns to lay a serious look on them.Ya'll listen to me now. If you see that old man, don't get near him. He's the triple six real deal scratch you hear me? Mud waits for nods from them both.All right.Ellis, can you climb up that trunk and get these hung?Take a foot of line and tie `em off with a bowline knot. You know it?Neck, start cuttin' line. Three fifteen foot sections. Count a foot long as your arm. Mud begins threading the pulleys with rope. As Neckbone cuts rope, he sees the pistol stuck in the back of Mud's pants.It's got a wolf's eye sewn in the sleeve. More protection than a bullet ever gave. Tom swears by it.Tom's the closest thing I ever knew to a father.It's hard not knowin' the ones you came from.Tom did that for me.Tom's had lives you'd never know about. Grew up up North. Went to Yale. For a long time he was a paid killer for the C.I.A. Lived in Cuba in `63. He's probably killed more people than you've met.One down! Neckbone and Ellis watch as Mud scampers around the trunk to the next branch. The chainsaw cranks back on.What you say Ellis? Ellis turns to find Mud standing on the deck of the boat holding a fistful of wires. He jumps down.You find a motor?I made a bonfire. Mud enters the woods. Ellis follows.Bonfire's an all purpose cure all for bad luck. I don't know where this boat's been or what kind of person had it before me. For all I know it could have some serious bad business left on it. We got too much ridin' on this thing to leave to chance. Where's Neckbone?What he say?You don't know his story.You should. Tom loved a woman more than most men could in two lifetimes. They had a good life started together. Mud hops down and scoops a load of wood into his arms.She was pregnant with a little boy, but the birth got the better of `em. They didn't make it. Tom's been alone ever since. Lone wolf. Mud has begun walking back to the treeline. Ellis stays.Thanks for the wood Ellis. Ellis watches him go, thinking on what he said.King. That's what they call him. A BOAT TRAILER rests atop FOUR, 55-GALLON BRIGHT YELLOW BARRELS affixed with plastic zip ties. The make-shift raft is half on shore with the back still floating in the water. The boys watch as Mud walks around the trailer cutting off the zip ties. The barrels kick out from underneath the trailer as this happens.He's their father. You didn't go near him did you?Good. That left-handed sonofabitch is the devil himself. If he's here, then it's time. We need to get Juniper out here.I need one that runs. Mud moves to the front of the boat trailer and begins dragging it fully onto the bank. It's heavy.All right then. Give it a shot.We do need a motor. Ellis thinks on it as Mud takes a deep breath and grabs the trailer again.What you say there?! Ellis appears out of the dark, followed by Neckbone. Mud's eyes search the treeline for Juniper.What you say Ellis? Ellis can't look him in the eye.Is Juniper okay?Where is she?What happened? Was it Carver?What's goin' on Ellis?What?She probably thought Carver was on to her.What was she doin' with the other guy? Ellis hesitates, not wanting to say. Mud pushes.What were they doin' Ellis?And that's how it is. He takes the pot of roofing tar over to the boat and begins pasting some of the newly replaced boards with a flat stick.Just go home Ellis. Ellis looks at Neckbone, then sets the grocery sack on the ground.What are ya'll hidin' for? Mud drops the wiring and scales down to the bank. They emerge from the woods. Ellis carries the yellow shirt.Keep it. I don't need it anymore. Mud goes to the motor at the rear to tinker with more wires.I guess.I did a lot of drinkin' last night. Mud stops and walks over to address the boys. His face is pale and his manner is curt.Neck I'm gonna need you here to get the motor runnin'. Ellis I need you to do something else for me. Mud removes a folded note from his back pocket.I need you to take this to Juniper.Let's go.I had a dream last night. I saw Juniper laying in a field with another man. They were making love. I walked out into the field. Walked toward `em. I was so angry the tips of my ears were burnin'. That's how I knew I was gonna kill this man. But when I got up close enough, I saw that the man she was with had tattoos on his back, just like mine. I moved in closer and the guy turns his head back toward me. Hair for hair, dead truth, the guy she was with was me. Mud ducks back under the motor. Ellis looks at Neckbone, worried.I'll finish the boat, but I'd be surprised if I live long enough to sail on it. A vision of yourself is a sure sign of death. Neck can you grab me a socket wrench? Neckbone and Ellis walk to the toolbox sitting nearby. They crouch by it, speaking quietly.Nothin'.What'd she... Ellis punches Mud with as much force as he can muster. It's barely enough to turn Mud's face, but it stuns him.Come on Ellis. Mud holds a hand out to him. Ellis slaps it away.Get the motor started. Neckbone cranks the motor. As they move up river, Mud searches Ellis' body. He looks at his neck, his arms, he pulls up his shirt.Shit. He rips the jeans up to the thigh. Mud tears a section of cloth from the bottom of his own shirt and creates a tourniquet just below Ellis' knee.What time is it? Mud pulls a black Sharpie out of his pocket. Neckbone doesn't answer, just stares.Yell out every 10 minutes! Mud elevates Ellis' leg then gently cups his head. He dabs the gash on Ellis' forehead.We just need to get him to a clinic! Is there still one in town?!It's the closest?!I'm gonna need your bike!No. He holds Ellis as they move steadily up river.He's been snake bit. ANOTHER NURSE rushes off calling for a doctor. The room becomes more frenzied. Patients talking. Nurses shouting.He's snake bit. A cotton mouth. On his calf. Just under an hour. As quickly as Mud gets this out, a GROUP of NURSES rush out of a door at the end of the room pushing a gurney. They take Ellis from Mud's arm, place him on the gurney, and speed him into the back of the clinic. The commotion gone, the reception area feels oddly still. Mud takes a deep breath. He looks to his right. Patients stare at him. He's beyond disheveled. He's crazy looking. Mud turns to his left. The Male Nurse stares at him. For the first time, Mud realizes he's out in the open.The sun does shine on a dog's ass some days.I know. Mud walks back on shore and collects his duffel bag.I owe you your end of the deal. Mud removes the pistol from the back of his jeans. Neckbone's eyes light up. Mud hands it over and Neckbone immediately notices a hole where the clip is missing.The deal was for the gun, not the bullets.I got one last favor to ask you. Neckbone sucks his teeth.Ellis?Yeah. Mud pulls his body through the window. It's tight but he manages to make it look somewhat graceful. Mud takes a quick survey of the dark room. Ellis begins to get out of bed.No, don't get up. Mud motions him back down and pulls the chair from the desk over to the bed. They speak in hushed voices.Neck brought me.We got the boat in the water.Just now. Smooth sailin' from here on out.Wish you coulda seen it.Didn't feel right leavin' town without sayin' goodbye. There is an awkward moment.No. No. You were right to be mad. You were right about a lot of things. I'm the one that's sorry. I shoulda never gotten ya'll into all this. I just didn't see any other way around it. But I couldn't leave without you knowin' I never lied about being your friend. I never lied about that.I don't traffic in the truth too often. But I did love her. I do love her.I just made mistakes. We both did. This is a hard life to keep up with. You can't blame her for gettin' tired of tryin'.That's not true. Don't judge your life on all of our mistakes. You'll make plenty mistakes of your own, no need takin' on everybody else's. You're a good man Ellis. If you find a girl half as good, you'll be all right.No. I'm not. But maybe from here on out I can be... A SHOTGUN BLAST rips a fist-sized hole in the flimsy interior wall. Mud, as if by reflex, yanks Ellis from the sheets and shoves him under the bed.Stay put! JUST STAY UNDER THERE! The SOUND of shotgun shells being slipped into the chamber. Mud gets to a crouch. Through the holes in the wall, Mud makes out Nelson, the fat bounty hunter, reloading his gun.You still down there bud?Stay put. Mud pops out of the bedroom into the den.", "clean_line": "boys respond mud walks past casts helluva thing boat trees helluva thing mud continues walking shoreline reeling bait boys follow tentatively

to be helpin' me. I had to load this myself.Just get in the back. Can't be later than we are.Let's go son. Ellis crumples the wrapper to his finished hotdog and jumps down from the bed of the truck.It's ten you do your share. I loaded this mornin'. That makes it five. Ellis begrudgingly stuffs the five in his jeans.Hadn't you seen enougha him today?You see anymore Ding Dongs over there? Ellis checks under his seat and pulls out a half-empty box of Ding Dongs. Hands one over to his father who rips the package with his teeth.What?You spy on me in my own house?That's your mother's business. Senior makes this his answer, eats the Ding Dong.What? Senior doesn't turn around from his work at the sink.Why?Some people move to this river to work on it, and some move here to be left alone. Senior makes his way to the ice machine and begins scooping ice into a large white cooler. Mary Lee emerges from the houseboat dressed for work, a secretarial job. Senior stops what he's doing to watch her. She walks over to Ellis.Home for dinner? Ellis is startled by his father's voice. Senior sits in a lawn chair under the eaves of the carport. He's hidden in shadow, save for a red glow from the tip of his cigarette.I ain't hidin'. He notices Senior tip back a pint of liquor and set it at his feet. Ellis opens the screen door leading inside.Come over here. Ellis lets the door fall shut and skulks over to a beam that supports the carport. He leans into it.You know I love you?I work you hard 'cause life is work. You know that?Your Mamma's been talkin' 'bout movin' in town.She seems set on it. Wants to separate. She may ask me for a divorce. This hits Ellis like a ton of bricks. He rights himself.It means enjoy the river son. Enjoy it while you live on it, 'cause this way a life isn't long for this world. Game and fish's 'bout made certain of that.The houseboat's in your mother's name. Her daddy give it to her not me. If she wants to leave it, Game and Fish has ever' right to take this boat apart board by board.Like I said, this is your mother's business.I've let you down. A man should be in charge of his own affairs, but I haven't worked it like that.I don't know about that anymore.Ellis? He stops and turns back to his father. Senior tries to express a sentiment he doesn't have the words for. Ellis continues inside.Where'd you get that black eye?What you fightin' for?What girl?You got a girlfriend?When'd that happen?You seen your mother today?You not talkin' to me?Well, that's your mother. Would rather tongue lash a problem than step up and handle it. You'll see one day. Women are tough. They'll set you up for things. You can't trust love, Ellis. If you're not careful, it'll run out on you. You just gotta pick a woman and roll the dice. Hope you don't wake up in fifteen years hatin' each other. Ellis keeps staring out the window as they pull into the parking lot of the Catfish Parlour Restaurant.Ellis! Let's go! Ellis snaps around to find Senior leaning out the restaurant door. Ellis yanks the cooler down and drags it inside. He looks back over his shoulder for a final glance at the men.What the hell have you been doing?You tell her. You tell her what you've been up to.J.J. Crawford said a boat motor went missin' from his stock yard. Said his daughter saw this one and his friend haulin' it off. This makes Mary Lee pause.Now you tell me right now, did you steal that motor?Lie to me again.You tell me I raised a thief?You take property that's not yours. Property that belongs to another man. That junk is his livelihood. I'm ashamed of you. Ellis drops his head. His face flushed.Shut your mouth. You think you can take things and not have him see it? Neither one of you has any respect for a man's livelihood. A life that puts clothes on your back and food in your stomach.Don't tell me what I know. If you can steal a man's life out from under him in front of your son and think he won't take a lesson from it than you're even dumber than you look.She's raisin' you a snake like herself, and you can curl up with her `fore I give a damn. You just remember this when you watch them rip this house apart board by board. You Hear Me! Mary Lee slaps Senior hard. He turns to her, saying nothing.I don't care what you do Ellis. Senior retreats to the bedroom. Ellis is left alone in the wake. He looks to his room. The door opens slightly and Neckbone takes a step out. Neckbone doesn't say anything. He just bites at his lip, sympathy for his friend.What the hell are you doin'?! Ellis says nothing. He doesn't move. Senior, continuing to yell, runs and drags a hose up from the houseboat.Ellis dammit! What the hell's wrong with you?! The fire hisses as Senior turns the hose on it.Ellis? Look at me. Ellis finally looks up at his father. A phone RINGS from inside the houseboat. Senior holds the hose in front of him.Take it. Put this damn thing out.I don't give a shit! Fine! I don't care what you do! I'm done with it! Ellis moves around the fire so he can see the houseboat through the flames. He hears the phone SLAM down. Senior appears at the back door. He stares at Ellis through the fire. Ellis moves to the side but realizes Senior isn't staring at him. He's staring at the fire. Senior disappears back into the house. There is a commotion. Ellis watches as Senior bursts out of the house holding an armful of woman's clothes. Senior walks up to the bonfire and begins tossing clothes on top piece by piece.You had us scared son. Senior steps forward and kisses Ellis on the forehead. Staying close to his face.Come on. Let's let him rest. Mary Lee touches Senior's hand on her shoulder. She stands.It's okay. It's okay. The two sit alone on the edge of the houseboat. The river seems especially quiet now.Yeah. Ellis begins to get out but stops when Senior speaks.Ellis? You mind your mother okay? This is a big change for her. She needs your support.All right. I love you.", "clean_line": "posed helpin load later let son ellis crumples wrapper finished hotdog jumps bed truck share loaded mornin makes ellis begrudgingly stuffs jeans hadn seen enougha today anymore ding dongs ellis checks seat pulls half box ding dongs hands father rips package teeth spy house mother business senior makes answer eats ding dong senior turn work sink people river work left senior makes way ice machine begins scooping ice large white cooler mary lee emerges houseboat dressed work secretarial job senior stops watch walks ellis home dinner ellis startled father voice senior sits lawn chair eaves carport hidden shadow save red glow tip cigarette ain hidin notices senior tip pint liquor set feet ellis opens screen door leading inside come ellis lets door fall shut skulks beam supports carport leans know love work hard cause life work know mamma talkin bout movin town set wants separate ask divorce hits ellis like ton bricks rights means enjoy river son enjoy live cause way life isn long world game fish bout certain houseboat mother daddy wants leave game fish right boat apart board board like said mother business ve let man charge affairs haven worked like know anymore ellis stops turns father senior tries express sentiment words ellis continues inside black eye fightin girl got girlfriend happen seen mother today talkin mother tongue lash problem step handle ll day women tough ll set things trust love ellis careful ll run gotta pick woman roll dice hope wake years hatin ellis keeps staring window pull parking lot catfish parlour restaurant ellis let ellis snaps senior leaning restaurant door ellis yanks cooler drags inside looks shoulder final glance men hell tell tell ve crawford said boat motor went missin stock yard said daughter saw friend haulin makes mary lee pause tell right steal motor lie tell raised thief property property belongs man junk livelihood ashamed ellis drops head face flushed shut mouth think things respect man livelihood life puts clothes food stomach tell know steal man life son think won lesson dumber look raisin snake like curl fore damn remember watch rip house apart board board hear mary lee slaps senior hard turns saying care ellis senior retreats bedroom ellis left wake looks room door opens slightly neckbone takes step neckbone bites lip sympathy friend hell doin ellis says senior continuing yell runs drags hose houseboat ellis dammit hell wrong hisses senior turns hose ellis look ellis finally looks father phone rings inside houseboat senior holds hose damn thing shit fine care ellis moves houseboat flames hears phone slam senior appears door stares ellis ellis moves realizes senior isn staring staring senior disappears house commotion ellis watches senior bursts house holding armful woman clothes senior walks bonfire begins tossing clothes piece piece scared son senior steps forward kisses ellis forehead staying close face come let let rest mary lee touches senior hand shoulder stands okay okay sit edge houseboat river especially quiet yeah ellis begins stops senior speaks ellis mind mother okay big change needs support right love"}}}
