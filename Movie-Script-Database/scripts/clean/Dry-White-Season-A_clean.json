{"Dry-White-Season-A": {"BEN": {"raw_line": "This was your best race.You did son. Come on, shower.I'll be expecting you. There isn't much to do, only weeding the marigolds and watering the lawn and flowers.And how's the algebra? Still giving you trouble?See you both later. Gordon returns to his work a little distance further. A group of students are laughing and pushing each other boisterously. As they near Jonathan, two nudge each other and giggle. Then, one of them trips Jonathan. He falls to the ground and jumps up aggressively, about to attack the boy. Gordon shouts \"Jonathan.\" The headmaster, MRS. CLOETE, aged 65 years, has observed the incident, but takes no action.I wondered why he wasn't at school. Would it help if I came to see him? He's always seemed a good kid to me.Of course. I'll phone and we can fix a time.She's having trouble with her boy. He won't come to school.Yes! She smiles and walks him to the car affectionately. EXT. BEN'S HOUSE - BARBECUE - DAY The Du Toit family.Gordon! What are you doing here?I'm sorry, Gordon. But there must be a reason.What about the court? Didn't he state his case?I don't think there is anything we can do about it now. Outside, peering through the half-opened door, is Johan, shocked at what he sees. Ben tapes Jonathan on the head, he pulls up his shorts painfully, yet fiercely, anxious to cover himself up again.A lawyer? That won't heal Jonathan's buttocks. Susan appears at the door.I'll be out in a minute.Don't worry, Gordon. I'm sure there'll be no record, it's such a minor case. Please don't worry. Ben calls Johan from the outside.Johan, get some iodine from the cupboard.Rub it on the wounds and it will help. EXT. BEN'S GATE - DAY Ben watches the black man and his son trudge down the long drive, the father's arm on the son's shouldre. At the foot of the drive the nose of an exotic Soweto cab can be seen waiting... a large butterfly painted on the hood.Jonathan has been caned, by the police. She places the boerwors and the beer before him.Hold it, champ. He crosses the yard to Gordon, fluffing his hair dry, Johan follows behind.Gordon, you okay? No response again. Gordon continues to work. Ben and Johan exchange puzzled looks.How is he, recovering?Again?Disappeared? He's a child -- why didn't you tell me? Gordon just looks at him, sadly, patiently.Okay! I'll see what I can find out.Our gardener, yes. Probably nothing, but he's worried. INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - DAY Sumptuous lawyer's offices, Johannesburg. They're lush- carpeted. A black woman cleaner is finishing off her early-morning chores, packing up as white staff are be- ginning to arrive. They're fresh, shining, attractive -- whipping the covers off typewriters. A young black girl, smart, well-groomed, is carrying a tray of coffee, desk to desk. FOLLOW her as she approaches her employer's open office door.Hello, Dan... No... it's all right...Thanks a lot, Dan... I'll tell Gordon. 'Bye. Ben hangs up and stays there... thinking... until the BELL snaps him out of his thoughts.What can we do, Gordon? You or I... We can't change it.It's a terrible thing, Gordon -- God knows I'm sorry. But you have other children to live for... I'll help them too with their schooling.I told you, Gordon... He died on the day of the riots.Gordon. The police -- if they've said...Don't worry! I'm no crusader. I've known Gordon a long time, that's all.Something like that -- yes.And he was such a nice boy, well- mannered.Looks quite attractive to me.'... Is only the latest in scores of black youths who have disappeared whilst in police custody.'My God, one hundred shot! They didn't have to kill them.Jeezus -- Jeezus -- Jeezus Christ.Yes, son. Go and get some sleep. The boy nods and leaves.I don't know. I'm just tired, I suppose.I will, in a minute. I'll just put the thoughts of Standar Six away. They mustn't be lost to posterity.All right, time up! Hand in your test. Moans from the students.What's happened, Emily?Don't worry too much, Emily, I'm sure Gordon will be home in a few days.Nice to meet you, Colonel Viljoen.Long time ago.Well... to put it simply, Colonel...I thought there might have been some kind of misunderstanding I could help straighten out.I know him, Colonel. He works at my school. He's done work for me too.Yes, after so many years... 10 years. Gordon's not the type to get himself in trouble. He's an honest, hard-working, church- going man.I appreciate that -- but Gordon would never...Colonel -- believe me, I'm with you all the way. But in this case -- I'm sure that in your worthy pursuit of the guilty you have, unwittingly, involved the innocent. After all, we're all human. We all make mistakes sometimes. Viljoen laughs again.Colonel, I'd welcome it.Jonathan.Yes. He died some time ago. Viljoen doesn't react.Nothing, Colonel.Of course he did -- he was upset. The Colonel pauses.He is a religious man... in the end he would have resigned himself to it.Come on, Colonel! If one of your kids died... ... and nobody would tell you how it happened or where his body is buried, wouldn't you be upset?I've never doubted it, Colonel. It's you who appear to be doubting me. These questions. You're making me feel like a criminal. There's a moment's pause -- then a burst of laughter.One last favor, Colonel?Gordon's wife -- she's very worried. May she bring him some food and a change of clothes while he's still here?Thank you. I'll rely on you, then.I think so. And thanks. I feel much happier now.I will. Goodbye.I talked to them. Gordon will be released soon. The colonel was very understanding.No.No, but... Johan, he is dead. We can't do anything for him. Don't mention this visit to your mother. Okay? INT. DU TOIT KITCHEN - NIGHT Suzette and Susan in the kitchen arranging the dessert tray. The kitchen is surprisingly neat. LAUGHTER is coming from the dining room.That's right, Suzette. But, only one detainee: 'Gordon!'That's right.Of course it is. I went down there, told them. They're looking into it.John Vorster Square.No. And you're not going to tell her.More wine? Viviers?Mrs. Cloete?It's all right. Viviers returns to his seat as Ben shuts the door behind him.Oh, it's you... hum... Stanley, isn't it? That's all right, darling.Dan! I'm standing here with Gordon's clothing in my hand. It's bloodstained...There are broken teeth in the pocket. Monday may be too late! The lawyer has been banned.I'm just trying to help Gordon. ... You represented many cases, tell me, does this happen often? But Gordon's not political. Okay, Dan, I'm sorry for disturbing your weekend. Ben replaces the phone. Turns to Emily and Stanley.He agrees to see you tomorrow and will apply to the supreme court for an interdict to stop any assaults on Gordon. And, we'll find out what's going on.They could make a mistake.We're not concerned with 'blacks.' We're talking about GORDON. A good man and very loyal.What?What do you mean 'good riddance'?Gordon's not subversive and definitely not a Communist.I'm not talking about the government! I believe in our government, damn it... His sharp tone surprises everybody. He quiets.... Look, I know the police often know more than we do. I'm not questioning that. I'm as loyal as the next man. But I do know Gordon Ngubene... there is something wrong.Dominee? Bester shakes his hand.What difference would it have made?I didn't want to upset you.Now what?... If I'd been more ambitious.What's happening -- it's something I've never had to face -- deal with -- before.Be patient with me... When Gordon is free you'll have me all to yourself again... promise.Nonsense. One's as old as he feels. I feel young and very attractive. I can still do my duty. She smiles up at him, chuckles, and then they kiss.What? The news leaves Ben speechless. Stanley continues in flat, emotionless tones.Suicide... is that what they told Emily -- poor woman...God! I never thought Gordon could commit suicide.How do we know?Yes, but...Anything I can do to help?Brothers?Stanley, I'd like to see Gordon.Don't you understand? I've got to go.How can you talk like that!?You mean you had no hope, you didn't believe he'd be released?Well, thank God Emily has you to lean on, Stanley.Do you belong to the xhosa tribe too?I am an African too! Stanley turns abruptly.I was fourteen before I wore shoes -- except for church... I grew up on a plaas miles from any town... watching sheep and...So this is Soweto.Please, take me to Emily.I really have to see her, Stanley. Stanley drives off.What do you mean?I... I cannot think. I'm confused.For Christ sake, just get off my back, Stanley.What?Who's he?He would have testified. Bloody hell!His report has to be important. We can only use what we have. Therefore, Lewinson must get a very good advocate. If only we could get hold of this Hassiem's report.It's not a question of being spectators. The courts are impartial, the law is what matters.Who?Now tomorrow at ten...Good night. Stanley drives vigorously away.I went to Soweto and saw Gordon's body. They have lied to me, my own people -- they killed him! I saw the body.Facts? There's a doctor who participated at the autopsy. A Doctor Hassiem and he...That's him, he represented Emily at the autopsy.Can I have a drink?You always know what I need. Johan hurries into the house.How are you, Emily?I didn't mean to disturb you. I've come to talk to you.I'm sure. Robert walks in, looks at Ben and walks into his bedroom to fetch something, then as he's about to go out:Emily, I have really come to assure you that I will do all I can to help you find out what really happened to Jonathan and your husband -- we cannot bring them back to life, but we can make sure that this sort of thing won't ever happen again.The air must be cleared. So we can breathe again.Gordon wasn't a coward and we'll prove that. We have a very good advocate for the inquest. His name is De Villiers. I have confidence in him and the truth will come out.Emily, Stanley and I will do all we can. As I said we have a good advocate. Everyone involved with Gordon's death will be questioned and all that's known regarding what happened in John Vorster Square will come out.Lawyers ask questions.I'm pleased I came.Do I...Are we still in Soweto?What the hell are you playing at?Don't call me Lanie! What does that mean anyway?I think I am without awareness. I have always cared about people, call it a social conscience. But my visit to Gordon's house made me experience another dimension of human conditions.No, I expected that. But listening to them talk made me realize that I did not know the blacks. Now I question my attitudes, my concerns as Ben, and complacence as a white person.De Villiers is making mincemeat of them.It's obvious to anybody! The evidence is clear! Did you see Archibal's back? He didn't have to tell the truth.totally depressed, walking up to Emily.I'm sorry, Emily.My car is over there.Obviously of the Rand Daily Mail. I read your article about Jonathan.You do? Melanie smiles.I remember. The mortuary in Soweto... ... The ambiguous Stanley.He couldn't have given you a glowing report of me. I'm sorry, but where are we going?Mrs. Bruwer, I'm not...I really must go home.How long have you lived here?I have nothing against them.Please. A...No thanks, a beer will be fine.I thought they were German? Melanie sits, her legs propped up on the settee, hugging her knees.Please, call me Ben.Why do you ask? Can you understand it?Tell me, Miss Bruwer...Tell me, do you believe in the notion of justice?What use is a system if justice does not apply to all situations?That's a tall order: 'know injustice... know the enemy.' it seems I have a long haul ahead of me.Thank you, darling.They killed Gordon -- first they kill Jonathan, and then him. How can they get away with it?I'm not so sure about that, Susan!Soweto! Then shuts the door behind him.More meneer Van de Merwe.Our boys gave the Eastern province a thrashing.Is anything wrong?And a packet of tobacco and pipe cleaners. The man gets them and takes a note from Ben and gives him his change. By then a man is waiting.See you tomorrow.How's that, Suzette?Now listen...Do you really think I specially arranged for the photographers to take that picture? And what's more it's distorted.Suzette, pull yourself together!Suzette!That goes without saying.Who?... I don't know you and have nothing to say to you... No thank you for your advice! He puts the phone down. The PHONE RINGS again. Ben picks it up and waits.It's you, Viviers... I appreciate it... of course... Not yet... Any thank you. Tot siens.Morning, Mr. Cloete... I'd like to say... ... Mr. Cloete, may I ask what on earth has the picture to do with politics?... I'm sorry Mr. Cloete, I have to go.Did you read the papers, Dominee? Were you happy with what came to light? And is it the Magistrate's work to pretend that the facts which came to light didn't exist?I know, Gordon. What they said about him, that he was plotting against the government -- is a downright lie. He was only doing what I would have done as a father; searching for his son.Have you no faith in your fellow men, Dominee? Don't you love your neighbor?What's the use of reaching a court when a handful of people have all the power to decide what is going to be said in that court and by whom? The one man they allowed to speak for himself, that young Archibald Chigorimbo, didn't he immediately deny everything they forced him to say in his statement? And the girl who spoke of her own torture?That did not refer to our situation in this South Africa. Do you know what I believe in, Dominee, that once in one's life, just once, one should have enough faith in something to risk everything for it.I don't mind, Mr. Cloete.The woman lost her husband, she was shattered with grief.I can't see that it makes any difference.Viviers.Good afternoon, Professor.Ben Du Toit. You have a nice vegetable garden.Both. What plants are these?Not really. I've read a few books.What about Jesus?It's quite nice.I feel I have no choice.That's encouraging.What you say is very interesting and important.We Afrikaners have to stop to turn a blind eye and look around us and at ourselves.Professor Bruwer, may I say I have needed to hear somebody say some of the things you said. I still have hope for our country.Thank you.There is absolutely no doubt that they were killed in custody. Those responsible must be punished, whoever they are, or whatever their rank.Tell me, Dan, we lost at the inquest, what next?What does that entail?I know what I have to do.Why? You didn't write it.No.A distorted photograph and a few poisoned words and meneer Du Toit is a leper. That's why I called on you the other day, I needed to talk to somebody rational.You are an Afrikaner too, and your articles, in a liberal English paper?What kind of loyalty? Blind loyalty. Until the deaths of Jonathan and Gordon, I gave all the loyalty I could give, laager loyalty. You know, Melanie, we Afrikaners have always lived in our laager, we have not seen what's beyond the mountains.We carry on. There has to be justice.We lost at the inquest, so we pursue them in a civil action. I consulted the attorney Dan Lewinson.However you go about it.I wasn't thinking about myself.My thoughts, Captain, I'm sure, are an open book to you.Not on your list of banned books, Captain?Why don't you go upstairs?Sorry. Didn't hear you arrive.Fine. He goes to MOTHER-IN-LAW. He kisses her on the cheek.And how are you, Ma?Why doesn't everyone sit down?I thought you'd prefer Cape Town; the sea and Table Mountain.What about?Are you blaming me for trying to help those people?I am glad you mentioned it, Father. Because I'd like to discuss the whole thing with you. First, there's the matter of Gordon Ngubene himself.The inquest didn't clear up half of what happened.We have no irrefutable evidence yet, but we have enough to indicate that something serious is being covered up.I know what I'm talking about. The black waiter places the drinks on the table.If they have really nothing to hide, why is the special branch going out of its way to intimidate me.They raided the house; they are tapping my phone, and I have been threatened by one of the officers.Why?It's exactly what I said, Father, when Jonathan first got into trouble. Of course, they have good reasons: hushing up how Gordon died and how his son died!You mean you're prepared to sit back and allow an injustice to be done.Now we're free to do to others what they used to do to us. What will you do if you were a black man in this country today, Father?We don't? I'm not sure we're going to survive.I'm sorry. They drive off towards Soweto.The special branch searched my house four days ago.A few journals, letters -- nothing much. Just wanted to scare me, that's all.They're not that stupid.What?No. They tried too hard. Stanley laughs again.What's happening? What's the singing?I understand.Stanley has told me about you. I appreciate the risk you are taking by coming here to meet me. I was reading the notes Gordon smuggled out of John Vorster Square...But, Emily, why didn't you tell me long ago?Emily, I have to meet the man.He has to be persuaded. He is very important to us.I know, with luck they may release him.But, Emily, this man is important, please try to tell him we will protect his identity. No one will know. Nothing will be done without his approval. I only want to talk to him.May I call you Julius, I'm not very good with some African names.This case must be reopened and we must win. We have to dig up everything. We need your cooperation, Julius.You could help with the affidavits. Lewinson the lawyer has stressed their importance.I'm glad.I wouldn't worry. I have a secure place.Johan. Was it because of me? He doesn't answer for a moment. Then he nods.Are you sure you know?Does it worry you?It's okay, son... we're all right. Everything's okay!It's okay, stay there, please!! Gently, he leads Susan who is sobbing now, out of the room. INT. KITCHEN - LATE EVENINGThey were trying to scare us, that's all.My house has been searched. My phone is tapped. My mail is opened. And last night three shots were fired through my window -- close to killing my wife. Viljoen reacts.All I want to know, Colonel, is why don't you leave me in peace?Tell me, Colonel, why is it so important to you people to stop my enquiries about Gordon Ngubene?Is that a threat, Colonel?By the Communists, I suppose.Goodbye, Colonel. I'm sure. He leaves. The colonel immediately picks up the phone.Johnson.A beer would be nice.I've driven through here many times.Ja.Alright, let's get on with it. Stanley tells me, you work at John Vorster Square.Yet you smuggled out letters to Emily?I know that. Tell me, what do you know about Gordon?You did talk to him from time to time?When was the last time you saw him?Did you attend any of the interrogations?How were they interrogating him?What?The pole, what's that?I see. Who were in that room? Stolz...You are sure?It's very interesting. When was the last time you saw him?You did! Johnson, why do you stay with the police? You don't really belong there.I understand. I promise.No, thank you. You know, Stanley, after what happened the other night I was about to give this whole thing up.My wife nearly got killed. Three shots were fired into the house. What right have I to expose my family to harassment and actual physical danger? That's what I asked myself.I didn't say I'm giving up.Johnson has revived my determination.You think we may still win in the end, Stanley?Why are you going there?What?A year in jail just for visiting his sister?Don't you think the real reason for this arrest was that they found out he was helping us?How can we shrug off a man we've been working with?What about you?I mean not married...Being a professor and bringing up a child, how did he manage that?And this little girl grew up to be a tough journalist. Why a journalist?About what?Oh. He must have been young.Go on. Melanie pours him another mug of coffee and starts to wipe up.And then you became a journalist?Did it work? She returns to the kitchen with a cigarette.How did you manage that on a South African passport? We South Africans are white devils in Africa.You really are your father's daughter!How often does he go on these trips to the veldt?Zululand! The whole thing smells of being an excuse to send her hundreds of miles from the case. And how will they live there?...So, that's why you went to Botswana for.Couldn't you stop him? He's a little boy, Stanley!It's impossible to stop now, Susan. I believe I'm right in what I'm doing. If I stop now I'll go mad.I have got to.Without simple justice we don't deserve a future.That last remark was slanderous -- I'm simply being faithful to the truth.It won't be necessary, Mr. Cloete. I'll send you my resignation.Are you serious?Later, Viviers.I'm sorry, Viviers. I never wanted you to get involved. I have just resigned.About the same size.I don't remember that, Suzette.I think he deserves the parson's nose for that remark. They laugh. Susan laughs. She does her best to compose. Suddenly... a KNOCK at the outside kitchen door. As Ben turns towards the door it opens and... INT. BEN'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOONStanley. What are you doing here? Before Stanley answers, the Father-in-law gets up from his chair and goes to the kitchen.Shut up, Stanley. That's all right. I'll...Please, go to the table. Stanley, wait outside.Stanley, this is still my house.Please leave me with him. I'll explain everything later.Maybe you think it's funny, Stanley, but I don't. Do you realize what you've done? Come into the dining room. Stanley follows Ben slowly, swaying.My father-in-law.Now pull yourself together, Stanley. It's not funny at all! What's the matter with you today? You're drunk and making an idiot of yourself. Say what you've come to say. Otherwise, go to hell! Stanley's laughter changes into a broad grin. He sur- veys the table and takes a bit of turkey from a plate and starts to eat it quietly.Bloody hell! Stanley, what's wrong with you?Emily dead? How? When? Stanley doesn't answer - he cries.What happened, Stanley? Oh, my God. Please tell me.God. Through the window, he sees Suzette and Chris carrying suitcases, back down the path to his in-laws' car; Father-In-Law shepherding his wife and an ashen, dazed Susan, helping them into the car.That's the main reason for coming here tonight. Melanie, I need your help. Without Emily, we can't pursue our civil suit. The only thing left open to us is to expose them through the press, and the media here and abroad.You know, Melanie, I'm discovering that the enemy is not in Soweto. The enemy is ourselves. Our bigotry, our laws, our system. We have our own fight and it's just beginning.Now, before going to the press, I have to have all the documents. I must have two vital affidavits; Dr. Hassiem's, he's detained and Jonathan's friend, Wellington has fled to Zambia.Could you?That would be very useful.Please. As Melanie walks away, Ben looks at her with admiration and tenderness... her dress swinging around her legs... her bare feet soundless on the floor... the quiet grace of her movement. On the way to the kitchen to get the drinks, Melanie goes to the record player. There's a record already on the turntable.Melanie. Be careful.Do be careful. I wouldn't want you hurt. She reaches for his hand.And hurry back. A new track starts on the RECORD.I can't dance.Listen, you... Just then a LADY and her daughter hurry to the man, push- ing a trolley. Man turns to look at Ben.I'm sorry, my mistake.-- How's she doing?I doubt it.Then don't.Suzette...Thanks. I'm glad you understand.You don't have to worry. They'll never find them.Dr. Hassiem? I'm Ben Du Toit. I'm a friend of Gordon Ngubene's...Not for me, Doctor. I've got to know what happened to Gordon.I know it may be painful to you, Doctor, but I need to talk to you.Ask Emily. Doctor, we are in the process of filing a civil claim. And your help is vital.Thank you for inviting me in.Just one thing, Doctor. Why did you sign the State Pathologist's report on the autopsy if you drew up your own report as well?The report produced in court had both your signatures on it.What did you write in your report?What was it?And then?Doctor, we've already got the African attendant's affidavit. He testified that Capt. Stolz ordered him to burn the clothes. Did you mention what you said in your report?Doctor Hassiem would you be prepared to put that in writing?You have a copy of the report?I think so.We have it, Stanley!Hassiem's report. You know what that means, Stanley? Melanie arrives in two days. We'll have all the evidence. Everything is in place. We'll get them yet, especially Stolz.God! It's Johnson Seroke.'A police spokesman when questioned said: \"It's not the first time that a black member of the police has lost his life in the service of his country, fighting terrorism.\" Bloody bastards! They killed him. Stolz must have thought he knew too much.Who's next on their secret list, I wonder? How much longer must the list grow of those who pay the price of our efforts to clear Gordon's name.I know. If I can no longer believe that right is on my side, if I can no longer believe in imperative to go on, what will become of me, Stanley? Ben looks at Johnson's picture again and shakes his head.You mean, if I cooperate, if I stop digging, embarrassing you, threatening you... these photographs will disappear.Suppose I refuse? Stolz looks past Ben.Johan, leave us alone, please.That's for you people to decide. Isn't it? I won't be blackmailed, Captain -- not even by you.Yes, I think so and there's more to come. A pause.It's not possible, Captain. Not between you and me.You mean my very last chance?If we can only survive through murder and torture, then we have forfeited our right to exist.Before you go. I'll tell this, Captain. I have a pretty good idea of what I will eventually uncover. I mean the truth. And I won't allow anyone or anything to come between me and that truth.Goodbye, Captain, and don't forgt the photograph. Stolz picks up the photograph and puts it into his briefcase.They are wasting their time. They just can't hurt me anymore. I trust you'll give them the message, Captain.A gin and tonic would be fine.Excuse me, I'm waiting for a lady with a red dress. Are there still, many people to come?Thank you. Just then an OFFICIAL walks out of the door. Ben hurries to him.Excuse me.I'm waiting for a passenger, Miss Bruwer. She's taking a rather long time to be cleared.Melanie Bruwer.No. They have to collect their luggage and pass through customs.That's possble.What now, Captain?Let's go home, Johan.I'll explain later.Thank you, son. You did a man's job. CUT TO:Thank you.Wellington's affidavit!Good old Melanie!It's you. It was a bomb.Don't worry. Safe. Thanks to Johan. Incidentally, I have Wellington's affidavit. Melanie found him. She's being deported. The official reason is that she possessed a British passport. I don't know how she managed to smuggle the envelope to me.No, thanks.What's so funny?How are you, Suzette?Would you like a drink?I know.Look after them.", "clean_line": "best race son come shower ll

Ben!Mrs. Coetzee. She looked worried.So you said you'd have a word with him?Ben!Trouble?He probably deserved it.Isn't that tragic? Jonathan was such a nice boy. Even played with my Johan when they were small, God.You said he was very bright at school. Chris helps himself to more. Suzette looks at the paper.This bloody Bruwer woman reports one hundred shot, but the radio said only twenty and the police were attacked first.You for a start. Come on! Help me clear these dishes. As Johan stands, to clear the table. He turns to his father with a smile, and shrugs -- an irritated Suzette joins them.Coffee! Come on, Johan. Time for bed. Johan pulls back from his father's arms.I'm proud of you, Ben... what you've done for that family. But darling, you shouldn't take these things to heart so much. What more can you do about it?Come, come to bed. Her housecoat has fallen open. He lifts his face to hers and kisses her.Champion of political detainees!Come in.Who are you? What do you want? CUT TO:More coffee, anyone?And a hard worker too.Why didn't you tell me you'd been down to John Vorster Square?I'm your wife, damn it!Upset me? It upsets me when you share your bloody secrets with a child! Johan is embarrassed. Ben glances at him. Johan shrugs and shakes his head \"not me.\" Ben planes on.Ben! Ben! Look at me for God sakes! Johan uit met jou! Johan leaves.We have a good life. We may not have everything we might have had if...Ben, what's happening? Sometimes it seems to me I don't know you.He's the gardener for God's sake, not one of the family.Ben. We're growing old.Oh, bloody hell!Ben, you're not a doctor. His death was announced officially. They wouldn't say anything unless they were certain of their facts.You mean the Indian doctor who's been arrested?Ben, I'm sorry about Gordon's death, but please for all our sakes, forget about this whole thing. Let's get back to a normal life.Please, Ben, I'm frightened.The poverty, ja...Ben, I know your anxiety about the inquest. All will be cleared up, in a legal way, and you'll be back to your normal self. Now let's turn off the lights. Susan kisses Ben tenderly. INT. COURT ROOM - FIRST DAY OF INQUEST - DAY The inquest of Gordon Ngubene... conducted by MAGISTRATE KLOPPER. In the witness box is DR. JANSEN, the state pathologist, giving evidence. Advocate DE VILLIERS is cross examining.Did you enjoy the 'bobotie?' When I heard the verdict on the news I knew you'd be upset. I wanted to make you something special.I'm glad it's all over. You take things to heart too much. Ben comes and stands behind Susan -- looking at her through the mirror.Now come on, Ben. Gordon's death upset me, too. But the Magistrate had all the facts. He must know what he's doing, he's had years of experience. The case has run its course, and nobody can do anything more about it! It's all over and done with.I'm damned well sure! It's over, Ben! You better get that into your head. Ben just stares at her with seething anger. She stands up and starts being hysterical.A teacher, always a bloody teacher. You never moved yourself for us. But for the blacks, oh yes. Whose side are you on, Ben? And I'm sick and tired of those natives coming here. Why don't you bloody well go and live in Soweto?Now where are you going?Not enough, Johan, to throw myself into the garden boy's arms.I'm afraid I don't understand.My father's an M.P.! Warn who?Papa! He is aged about 70 years, thick set. She rushes to him and he hugs her tightly and practically lifts her off the floor. She kisses him.Where's Mama?Mama!The perfume and a new hairstyle.I expected you a little later.Please don't say that, Papa. Ben walks in.I'll prepare some tea. I baked a cake. She goes to the kitchen.Ben, it's Johan. You'd better come. INT. BEN'S KITCHEN - EVENINGHe won't tell me why it happened Ben holds his son's arms, gently.You see! It's gone too far, Ben. You've got to stop it...Call the police, Ben, call the police! Johan's voice comes from his room.My God. They were trying to kill us. She's seated at the kitchen table. Ben has poured her a brandy which she cups in her hands.Oh, is that all... What the hell more do you want to happen... we're ordinary people for God's sake -- and you've pitched us into this -- this nightmare. I can't take any more, Ben... I can't take any more!!Please, Ben, stop. Just stop... please.Ben, please stop whilst there's time.

There's no other list somewhere?But, what about John Voster Square?Thank you.You're here too, sis Paulina, who are you looking for?We are all searching. The policeman calls her -- she hurries to the counter. CUT TO:What now?A black lawyer! Those Boers... the bastards'll kick him around till they lose him.Where is he? Where is he?Thank you very much. You've worked like a man. Let's go.Take it easy, boys. Hey Wellington! Wellington comes to the car. He's limping, wearing sunglasses. As he's approaching the car, Stanley opens the back door for him.What happened... Don't tell me...Jonathan is dead.How's it? I'm Stanley! I heard about you! Ben feels a little uncomfortable.You're all right, Lanie. Ben can just hear Emily's soft voice.Come on, sisi. Tomorrow it'll all be first-class again.Gordon's dead.The bastards say he committed suicide... hanged himself.They didn't tell her. She heard it on the radio like the rest of us. I contacted Lewinson immediately. He then rung the police to ask why Emily wasn't informed. Would you believe it, they said they were sorry, and they didn't know where to contact her. Ben walks slowly out of the garage in deep thoughts -- Stanley follows him.Did you understand me? I said, they said he committed suicide.Gordon wasn't a coward.What do you mean 'but'? What about Timol who they said had jumped from a top-floor window? What about Ngudle? What about Mosala? Joyi? Malele? They all died in that John Vorster Square. All suicide, eh? Ben stares at him. There is something like a strange silence between them. Ben is confused and Stanley is staring at him. Ben breaks this embarrassing mood.He's got brothers.I'm his brother, man, we all are! We'll take care of everything. That's the African way.Don't look for trouble, man. You know there are riots all over Soweto. You're out of it. Why don't you stay out?You got to go? Of course, Lanie... the last farewell. But we have to be careful.We expected it.A guy gets picked up by the S.B... he's part of history, man.Hope's a white word, Lanie... It's not hope we need.Emily is like my sister... We go back many years.I am an African. That's all! Comprende?What?Bullshit! Next you'll have me believing we grew up in the same country, same laws, same freedom, same everything!We are now about to leave the white jungle and entering the land of love and glory. The car approaches a huge perimeter notice:Land of love and glory, Lanie! But watch out for the police and army. They're patrolling all the time.Hurry up, Lanie.No sweets today. I'm sorry, babies. The children give Stanley a coy disbelieving look as they watch him go with the \"white man.\"'The living close the eyes of the dead. The dead open the eyes of the living.'Look, we'd took one hell of a chance to get here, let's not push it.I said don't push it. I have to keep you alive. What's more the house is full of mourners.What are your thoughts now?Come on. I know you came to see the body. What do you think now?You either believe what you saw or maybe you still prefer the government version.Okay. It was a simple question. Stanley turns his RADIO ON and BANTU MUSIC invades the car as it speeds away in a cloud of dust. EXT. WHITE SUBURB STREET - LATE AFTERNOON The big brassy Dodge is threading its way through the leafy calm of the white suburb.You know, Lanie, when you run a taxi, especially a pirate taxi like me, you have eyes and ears everywhere. Even when a policeman farts in his bed you know. People want a reference book, a permit to stay in Soweto, a house, anything, we taxi drivers know the routes. I'll tell you something...Shit!Dr. Hassiem has been picked up.Dr. Hassiem is the doctor we got to represent Emily at Gordon's autopsy. We wanted the truth. Ben suddenly realizes the significances.A smart move by your Boer brothers. They have silenced Hassiem.What's the use? It's one big game and we blacks are merely spectators. Hey Lanie, can one be a spectator as he's being kicked around? He laughs.That's what you all say. I have to move man. Your neighbors! Now, be careful. They will put their marks on you!You'll find out! In case you need me. Don't give your name -- just say 'Lanie' phoned -- right? Ben gets out of the car.Sharp! At our smart liberal friend's office, yeh!Mfundisi... ... Sisi!You must understand for us, suicide is a coward's way out, how do they say, it's a 'cop out.'He! Mfundisi, what are you saying now? You mean...If that's what you preach in your church you will soon be starving.Amen!Wait, let me check the situation. He opens the door and walks out. EXT. EMILY'S HOUSE - AFTERNOONTake it easy. It's okey, dokey, but hurry.Yes, on the floor man. Stanley opens the back door for Ben. Who crouches on the floor.Okay. Kids, time to go home. Be careful.Why don't you look for yourself? Ben rises and sees that they're at least a mile out. He is not amused.Precautions, Lanie.You will not understand, Lanie. They drive off.Don't worry, man. There's another day!African time.Doesn't matter, Lanie -- as long we are on time for the revolution.The S.B. searches your house? Did they take anything?Don't be so sure. They may think you're onto something big.'Lanie' -- don't you believe it -- nothing's as stupid as the old S.B. If they decide it's a bomb they're looking for, you can shove a turd in their face and they'll swear to God it's a bomb. He laughs... making Ben smile.And did they?Scare you?Hallelujah! Shake, man. Join the club.Did you hear that, Lanie? More kids dying?A wake for a child; eight months old. She was sleeping and they threw tear gas into it. They drive on. CUT TO: INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT Ben, Stanley and Emily are sitting 'round the table. Ben has pulled the lamp closer to read one of two notes from Gordon -- one is written on ruled paper, the other a square of toilet paper. The notes have been smuggled out of John Vorster Square.On your knees, everyone, prayers time. Ben is perplexed. Emily closes the door and locks it.Hey man, you should have been a mfundisi holiness oozer...He's one of the most solid lawyers we have; they've immobilized him, that's the right word isn't it?Sure.Nqakula, that's a hell of a name.They did not ban you so you could sit on your backside and have a Soweto holiday.Let's hope so.Not for me, Sis -- too strong for me. No whisky?Tea then... ... and God forgive me --How's it? No trouble finding this place? You met Sadie. She's one of us.And this is Johnson Seroke. The man of the letters.You know they call this place Vrededorp, but we baptize it Malay Camp. Your first time in Malay Camp, Lanie?The main road, eh?Sure, Sadie. And thank you. Can I help myself to another beer?That woman can die for you. We mustn't be long, Johnson has to be back on duty.If they find out he'd be in very big trouble.It's okay. Tell him what you told me.They handcuff you and manacle your feet then they put a pole between your arms and the back of your knees. Then you're like a chicken ready for the oven. They hang you between two tables. Then they do what they like with you. The S.B. call it the aeroplane. Ben is horrified.He's sure.This is strictly between the three of us. Don't worry, man.Take it easy. Stanley goes to the cupboard for another beer.A beer, Lanie?What happened, man?Three bloody shots and you crawl on your hands and knees to people like Stolz, and say 'I give up.' What is the beginning for you is a version of what we suffer all our bloody life. Shit, I thought you had more guts than this, man!But you thought about it.It's a hell of a time, Lanie, but we'll survive. You and me. I tell you!Of course not, Lanie -- but we needn't lose either -- what matters is to stick around.By the way, man, I'm off on a trip -- Botswana -- thought I'd tell you in case you get worried.Business. Tell you next week. Now for the bad news I've been saving to the last.Julius has been arrested. He broke his banning order and visited his sister. You know what that means? At least a year's imprisonment.That's the chance he took. And he'll be the last to complain.So what? Lanie, you're not getting guilt complexes now, are you? That's a luxury only liberals can afford. Julius will be back, man. All refreshed by a spell in the deep-freeze.Who said we're shrugging him off? Best way of remembering a man, Lanie, is to carry on fighting.She's a widow, man. That's what happens in Soweto when a woman loses her man. They throw her out of the house and out of the city.Shit! I was about to find her a place, but I had to go to look for Robert.Sis Emily asked me but it was no use. His mind was made up. He was going to join Wellington in Zambia.He'll be back in a few years. And he won't be throwing stones! Then, puts the empty glass on the desk.Good evening. I'd like to invite you into my humble home, but it's full of terrorists.Okay, with pleasure. They search and find nothing.Oh! Merry Christmas, everyone! There's deadly quiet -- not even the clink of a spoon -- as the Du Toits look on aghast.'Lanie'... compliments of the season, old mate.Why don't you tell the Boer who this Kaffir is?Who are these people, anyway?Let him try, leave him, Lanie.Lanie! Ever in your fucking life seen such a stampede, hah?Jeez, who was that old cunt with the potbelly and black suit, looks like an undertaker? INT. DINING-ROOM - AFTERNOONRight. Dead right. Put the Kaffir in his place. Ben grabs him by the shoulders and starts to shake him.Emily is dead.A broken heart. All they said.Take a pew, man.Have what?That's fantastic, man.Late at night. A knock on the door. He opened and five shots, point-blank range. Face, chest, stomach.What's the score? The nurse is detained; the mortuary attendant has disappeared; the police van driver who brought Jonathan to hospital is detained. Julius is in jail, and now Johnson dead.Hey! Are you going soft, Lanie? We must keep going even more so now. And for every bloke who's going to die of bloody natural causes in their hands. And for our children's future.What's happened, man?And the papers?Man, it's all happening!Like a joint?They drop the bomb on you! Ben walks up to him puts his hand on his shoulder. There's an understanding trace of a smile on his face. INT.

So, you must be Gordon Ngubene?We know each other, don't we?Gert, in daardie kammer. Jaimie, in die ander.Take the bastards away.Come on, Kaffir, talk!We don't like gramophone records here! Now who has been giving you informations?Johannes! The bag!All right.Come on you bloody black bastard. Who has been telling you lies?I'll be down immediately, Colonel. CUT TO:We told him how his son died, Mr. Du Toit.I'm working on it.How do you feel today? Ready to fly?Yes, Mister Ngubene, we know about this Wellington... and... ... We know about him... and him ... Now, we want the names of the others. And today you're going to tell us. The WOMAN in the next room SHOUTING louder than before -- that one is a real and tough activist --Bloody woman. Water! As Johannes is fetching the bucket of water. Venter goes to the cupboard and stays there.Okay. Gert! Gordon is given a short burst of electric shock.That was a small taste of 'Samson.' We have a whole day... A knock at the door.... Kom! A black policeman in uniform. JOHNSON SEROKE, enters with a letter in his hand.What do you want?What are you bloody-well waiting for?Get out of here. Seroke leaves.Now about these affidavits who told you to collect them? The A.N.C.? Who recruited you? Gordon mumbles something.What? He bends forward to hear, and Gordon's swollen, puffy eyes hold his gaze.You've had your chance. Now you're going to shit.Reg gert. Gordon suddenly shakes violently and shouts repeatedly.That's right, Your Worship.Acting on information we had received, I went to the house of the deceased, accompanied by Lieutenant Venter, Lieutenant Botha, and three native members of the security force. This was about 10 P.M. I informed Ngubene that he was under arrest under Article 6 of the Terrorism Act. He then became violent and resisted arrest. A certain force had to be applied to restrain him.We found several incriminating documents. These pointed to his involvement with the A.N.C. and activities endangering the security of the state.Never. He was always treated with courtesy and correctness. But, one time we had cause to use force against him. It was the day before his death. The deceased suddenly showed signs of aggression. He tried to jump through the open window of my office. He was acting like a mad man. It took six of my men to restrain him, and he had to be manacled hand and foot, for his own safety. But once he calmed down, he was ready to make a statement about his activities. The next morning we found him dead in his cell.Sometimes detainees deliberately injure themselves for propaganda purposes. The gallery screams its objections. Stanley leans forward and grins across the partition at Ben. The Magistrate warns the crowd. Finally the gallery quiets down.They had been removed for repair.He wasn't tortured.He fell down the stairs a few days ago.Your Worship, may I be excused? I have to escort detainee Archibal back to John Vorster Square.Mr. Du Toit, if you knew what we're working with every day of our lives, and what we're up against, you would understand why we have to be so thorough.I can understand you're upset about having your house searched ... but...What are you talking about then, Mr. Du Toit?An interesting book -- Picasso -- Not one I'm familiar with.Mr. Du Toit. If you're keeping anything from us, we can turn this whole house upside down if we want to. We have all the time in the world.I'm afraid she has to stay where we can see her -- in case she wanted to warn someone.We're all made of flesh and blood, Mr. Du Toit -- we've all got our flaws. And if a man likes to sample the grass on the other side of the fence, well, that's his own business. But it would be unpleasant if people found out about it, especially if he's a teacher.Let's just say I may be able to use my influence to make sure that a private indiscretion isn't used against you.Is this your son?Don't you think this business has gone long enough?Mind if I smoke?Now be honest. Has all the evidence you've been collecting in connection with Gordon Ngubene brought you closer to the truth you are looking for?I really hoped we could talk man-to-man.It's high time, Mr. Du Toit, we allowed the dead to rest in peace. I'm offering you a chance.One never knows. It may not be important to you, but we have to survive.Is that your final answer?Here's my card -- my private line. If you should change your mind... Let's say before the end of the week?Be careful, Mr. Du Toit. There are people who can make things very difficult for you.Afternoon, Meneer Du Toit. Johan, isn't it?Word came to me that you were asking after your very good friend, Miss Bruwer. You know, subersives come in all guises and can be very resourceful. Now let's take your friend, she has been using her privilege as a journalist to endanger the security of this country. But you know something else? She has been secretly holding a British passport. A South African passport and a British pasport. Now you tell me, where is her patriotism? Her allegiance? The minister telexed to the immigration officers here declaring her an undesirable immigrant. So she is being put on the first available plane to London. This must be heart- breaking for you. Good afternoon, Meneer Du Toit, Johan. Stolz walks back.We thought we'd save you the trouble, Mrs. Klopper.

The press is still pursuing them.Never mind your car. Let's get away from these vultures.By the way, I'm Melanie Bruwer.Ten out of ten, Mr. Du Toit. I know about you too.We have a mutual friend. One Stanley.Stanley? No. Just careful. A big black rough uncut diamond. Don't be fooled by his happy-go- lucky attitude. There's much more to him.I thought a cooling drink at my house.I promise you. I'm not after an interview or anything like that. She smiles.Please, Mr. Du Toit, and you'll meet my darling father. She smiles again. A disarming smile.There he is by the eucalyptus tree, on the left. That's old Bruwer.Oh, about twenty-one years. I love this house.Of course, Dad. I want you to meet a friend.Mr. Du toit, Dad.Be careful, I can see philosophy coming.What about individuality, Dad?A drink, Dad?That's my Daddy. Melanie and Ben enter the house.Now you see in what environment I was spawned. Ben looks at the shelves and smiles.Please sit down, on that chair. That's Dad's. Drink?A brandy?The mugs are the few things that Dad brought from Germany. He studied philosophy in Tubingen and Berlin before the last war.Mr. Du Toit, tell...All right, Ben, tell me, why are you so depressed? You really expect a different verdict?Of course I understand it. What could they have. I'm not cynical. I'm only trying to be realistic.Ben and Melanie, that's fair.I'll never stop believing. But in this country I've learned it's pointless to look for it in certain situations.Exactly. And you cannot fight for justice unless you know injustice very well. You've got to know your enemy first.Not at all, Ben. You have already taken the first steps. Welcome to South Africa! She smiles. INT. BEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Susan is sitting at the dressing table. She is applying cleansing cream to her face. She is relaxed. Ben is getting ready for bed.I didn't think you would want to have anything to do with me after that crap in the Ossewa.I'm a journalist, perhaps tarred with the same brush.So what happened? I can imagine. The family, the dominee, colleagues, neighbors...Thanks for the compliment. But remember, you're an Afrikaner, you're one of them. In their eyes they regard you as the worst kind of traitor.My mother was a foreigner, I'm not pure, wragte Afrikaner. They don't expect the same loyalty from me that they demand from you.Has it ever occurred to you that the Volk may be scared to leave the laager? That's the downfall of this country. So, where do you go from here?Justice.We know each other well.What?And living in this chaos with my eccentric father? I love him and we get on perfectly. We have been together since I was a year old. My mother could not adapt to South Africa. She went back to London and we've never heard from her since.Dorothy, dear Dorothy, she was a fantastic mother. In fact she had two families, me and her three children in Alexandra township.Sometimes I ask myself the same question. She leans against the sink and picks up her mug of coffee.Alright. I'll tell you. I was brought up in a sheltered way, not that Dad was possessive, not openly anyway. I think he'd just seen enough of the mess the world was in, to want to protect me as much as he could. Then, I went to university. I don't know what you'll think... being a teacher.Then I married my ex-teacher.Fifteen years difference. He too protected me like Dad. Then one day I visited Dorothy in Alexandra and saw her home and the appalling conditions in that township. I was shocked, Ben, and ashamed.That made me think that I was a parasite, something white and maggot-like... just a thing... a sweet and ineffectual thing. I felt more and more claustrophobic. Poor Brian, who loved and pampered me. Had no idea what was happening. I left him for a whole year and we divorced.I thought it would force me, or help me, to expose myself. To force me to see and to take notice of what was happening around me.I wish I could give you a straight answer. What did help me was my wanderings in Africa.My mother was English, remember? So I get a British passport. It comes in handy even for the paper.I wonder what he's doing right now. Most likely standing on a rock, looking through his old binoculars at springbok or a lion or whatever. One of the two large CATS approaches them, tail in the air, and goes to Melanie, drubbing against her legs, PURRING luxuriously. She picks it up into her arms.It depends -- -- Bonjour, Ben. I'm Porto and my friend is Bello! Ben smiles and starts to caress Porto in Melanie's arms.They don't know what you've got and you're a danger to them. I know there's a point of no return, but with our system, one has to plot the route with care.And your safety also, Ben, lies in the press. That way the world will know the brutality and power of our security services; here questions can be asked in Parliament. And the white public can appreciate the implications of the fascist laws of this country.We better win before the blacks have won. Ben and Melanie laugh.Zambia? I'm going to Rhodesia... I can go to Zambia.And I can use my British passport. I know my way around Lusaka.This calls for a drink. Gin and tonic?Of course, Ben. She goes into the kitchen.Cheers!Don't worry.That's my favorite, Ben.Rugger player? They laugh as they start to dance to the slow BLUES MUSIC. The laughing subsides as they hold each other closer. The dancing starts to lose the beat of the music. They look into each other's eyes and Ben envel- ops her tenderly in his arms hugging her as close as possible against him. They stop dancing. Ben kisses her. A long, warm and tender kiss. INT.
