And he gets everyone in the tribe going and they share in his vision and it heals them. It's the same in all cultures -- Greeks, Jesus. Some Indians say the first shaman invented sex. He's the one who makes you crazy.Uh no. I just write about it. What turns you on?Is it? I don't know. I think you're alive by confronting death -- by experiencing pain.It's only thru death that you know life. Jesus, medicine men heal people by sacrificing their own life.I think life hurts a lot more than death. When you die the pain is over.I bet your dad's a school teacher.I don't know.MilitaryYeah, about 8 times.Two.\"...but one, the most beautiful one of all dances in a ring of fire and throws off the challenge with a shrug\"I wrote it for you.Hey Ray, try acid man, it's guaranteed.I never had a bummer on acid.Whatever works.

I actually hear the music -- the spirit of the wine y'know, intoxication....be great wouldn't it?Hey why not, I could write the songs with you guys.There oughta be great orgies man. Like when Dionysus arrived in Greece, he made all the women mad, leaving their homes and dancing off in the mountains. Great golden copulations in the streets of LA. Hey, do you know her?I got a name.The Doors.\"The Doors of Perception\"? Acid...It's from William Blake actually, the line -- \"when the doors of perception are cleansed -- things will appear as they truly are...\"So where do we start? How do we start? Where are the girls?Let's try it again, come on. I'm just getting into it.Then you write one man! We need more songs anyway.

What's a rock and roll band for man, if you can't party all night and do bad things?I found an island in your arms A country in your eyes Arms that chained us, eyes that liedThe greater the suffering, the more terrible the events, the greater the pleasure Jerry. They want it, it's catharsis. Like the ancient Greeks.But they understand Jerry. All our real desires are unconscious and unseen. . .You love us?Ah, twenty one...I like a man wears his soul on his face.Jesus Ray, every girl out there wanted to fuck me, I could feel it for the first time!Guys, I'm serious about the desert, we still gotta deepen man, we gotta take some peyote -- all of us together, we got one more stage to go...Are you satisfied?It's not acid John, it's peyote.

Raise your hands c'mon man... let's go.Everybody having a good time?...awright, pretty good, it gets better.WOA!! It's fast.When the serpent appears, his head is ten feet long and five feet wide. He has one red eye and one green eye. He's deadly and he's seven miles long. As he moves -- on his scales is written all the history of the world, all people, all actions, all of us our little pictures on the scales, God it's big! -- and it's eating as it moves all the time, devouring, digesting consciousness, power, a monster of energy!We must kiss the snake on the tongue, if it senses our fear, it will eat us instantly. But if we kiss it without fear, the snake will take us through the garden and out the gate. To our freedom -we must ride this snake. To the end of time.You're fucked up John. Go with it, confusion is the sound of creation.No no no John John. God is crazy too. God is part insane as well as sane. Not in control all the time. Dionysus was the God of the wine. He made ecstasy but he also made madness. Madness is all right. That's what you want, isn't it, isn't it? Where's that joint?Die Robbie.I love you.Pain makes me feel more alive Ray. Pain is meant to wake us up. People try to hide their pain but they're wrong.Pam wants you. You're a good Catholic John, you want it so you can feel guilty about it... Fuck death away John.Maybe you should kill your father Robbie. He tried to kill you. Kill him!But you're Alive! It's beautiful! Fear, pain, lust, we've got to know all our feelings before we can come out the other side free men. Don't feel ashamed of yourselves, don't let society destroy your reality. Our freedom's the only thing worth dying for, it's the only thing worth living for!Then use us John, use our strength, it's us four now, a tribe of warriors, everything we have comes from the same source, the great Creator of Being. Trust him, trust us. Ride the snake. . . I promise you I will be with you till the end of time.My wild love went riding... mmmmmm. She rode all the day. She ride to the devil. And ask for him to pay... shooo shoooo...she went to the desert she went to the sea Joseph we did see......I'm lying to you. I am scared.I'll be back. I gotta go alone.The killer awoke before dawn He put his boots on He took a face from the ancient gallery And he walked on down the hallHe went to the room where his sister lived And he paid a visit to his brother And then he went on down the hall...And he came to a door, And he looked inside \"Father?\" \"Yes, son?\" \"I want to kill you\".Mother... I want to...Come on baby take a chance with us And meet me in the back of the blue bus Doona blue rog onna blue bus Doona blue yeah! Come on yeah!Kill the father, fuck the mother, kill the father, fuck the mother -- that's what I'm into! That's what I'm into!You have the face of a pig man.TAKE A LONG LOOK OLD MAN.

Pretty neat!The time to hesitate is through No time to wallow in the mire.Try now we can only lose And our love become a funeral pyre Come on baby, light my fire Try to set the night on FIIIIIIIIIRE!!!!!I don't mind dying in a plane crash, a smile on my face.I just don't want to go out slow -- brain tumor, botulism. I want to feel what it's like, cause death is only going to happen to you once.No wonder \"Light My Fire's\" number one.The biggest mistakes in my life have been haircuts.How 'bout, \"girl you couldn't bite my wire\".Uh well, we're kind of a sullen group, Ed.What -- are we the Beatles now John?Hey Ray, why don't you change your name to Sid or Irving Manzarek or something... it's only a word y'know.Come on baby, light my fire Try to set the night on FIIIIRRRRRE!I don't know... I guess I should see a doctor or something... maybe I should go to someone of the straight Jungian philosophy.It's so scary up there. To be adored. Isn't that irony? Teenage death girls want my dick -- a mere clown -- not my words. I'll never wake up in a good mood again... Lament for my cock, a tongue of knowledge deep in the feathered night, gives life, soar and crucify, I seek to know you...You should marry an insurance salesman.We weren't built to last.You really know what I am Pam? You know what poetry is? Where is the feast they promised us? Where is the wine -- the new wine -- dying on the vine?Y'see -- I lied to you. I really love Fame.'Cause you're in the room.Maybe you're the cause!I mean I don't have this problem with anybody else.No!!!!! Mommy!!!Get mad! Yeahhh! Love my girl! Yeah, go fuck the other guys. How many white guys have you fucked Pam? 10, 20? Black guys what? You like Chinese dicks? Mongolian penis? 30?How could I do thatHA HA HA!! WILL YOU DIE FOR ME!I'D DIE FOR ANYBODY.CUNT CUNT CUNT.I'M SORRY I'M SORRY I'M SORRY.THEN MOVE TO MIAMI YOU SLAVE!!!You were saying?...will you die for me, Pam, a clown, a despicable clown?... a mere despicable clown?...I need a home. A place to hide....how could we make a home?... where there's sanctuary?...we're in Africa, we're just animals... I wanna stay inside you all night baby... let's fuck death away, now fuck death away...Uh love death travel... revolt. We all write the songs, we're interested in anything about disorder, chaos, especially activity which seems to have no meaning... I think when you make peace with authority, you become authority.Yeah you can call us erotic politicians I guess....a scapegoat maybe -- I take on the audiences' fantasies, obeying their impulses. When the impulses are destructive, I'm destructive. It's kinda like sucking the puss out of a rattlesnake, something like that.I guess when you say something like that, it's a shortcut to thinking.I guess they didn't understand.Hey c'mon Ray, hate should be allowed.I like that -- \"boozy apocalyptic\" -- you're a word man, but how does your newspaper influence young people to think about Vietnam? Who's sending the soldiers over there to die? The establishment -- right? Your newspaper -- right? That seems to me a lot more dangerous than the stuff we do.Did you know Nietzsche said, \"all good consciousness, all evidence of truth comes only from the senses\"? Hey you wanna arm wrestle? Come on, you look pretty tough today. C'mon, I'll take you all on.Part of the clown's wisdom -- it's kinda the American way. You know we spend more on alcohol and tobacco than on education.Do you hurt?What hurts you the most?Uh... got tired of the barbie doll look. It hurt.About? Y'know when people are joking, I find they are dead serious and when they're dead serious, I find them funny.Actually, I don't really remember being born. It musta happened during one of my blackouts.Well, to be honest they're not living anymore so I don't like to talk about that.Oh, it was a... horrible car crash... in the desert in the fifties, Arizona... ran right into a truckload of Indians... Navajos, they were lying out on the road, all bleeding, and I was with my Grandma and Grandad, we were banged up and all... and I was looking at my Dad and he was lying there... but his throat was severed and there was air coming out.Y'all believe what you want to believe, you will anyway... but it does kinda show you what excites people? Fear, pity, horror -- all those good things that count. It's sorta I guess like being on the edge of an orgasm, y'know... that mystery just before you come. When? If? Should I? Will you die for me, eat me, this way, the end...Great! A new thing.Wow how old is this?The Craft?Wow! You Patricia? Who would've guessed?What?Where do you get the blood?No... I don't like... cutting myself.I'm gonna burn you down.Nobody'd ever look at you again -- 'cept me. I'd scar you forever.AWRIGHT! AWRIGHT!Mooooooo!!!Where are the Doors.We do everything together.I am the snake and you are the luteYeah... hey what's your trip?Love your movies man. What a great penis...You can't leave. Where's your will to be weird man?Don't go, y'see Norman Mailer, I hear he's here?I don't know... did he know who you were?Nah... later...I like outer space.Vodka? Race you.Wanna go?... Come on let's go.Come on there's pussy Robbie.Don't you guys wanna meet Andy Warhol?Come on man! I thought we were gonna be a band, the four of us -- and party all night, rock and roll!Don't go. Don't leave! You can't leave. I don't know what will happen. It might be Death.Nico!\"Lord Byron\"? Really. You think? You like the poems?These are the kindest words I've ever heard in my life. No one has ever understood. Thank you. Maybe I should always fuck my critics.Let's do it, here, now... with the sound of the crowd. Like Nuremberg, wild German fucking.I'm begging! I'm begging you!About what!What's your problem with fathers! They're dead, both of them, I told you.What'd he say? That was really stupid. Why didn't you just ask me.You're a fuckin' cunt. You could ruin his career if...I don't want to talk about it. Hate is a very underestimated emotion.You're wrong. What they want I can't give... my death -- ripped to pieces -- do you feel their power?I want to live, Patricia. I don't wanna die.Patricia... Patricia...Uh... nuthin'Hey, I'm with the band man. It's cool. Take it easy.Hey, eat it man!Mace! Shit!Why'd you blind me man? You blinded me!I BEEN BLINDED MAN. I BEEN MACED.I wanna tell you 'bout something that happened just a few minutes ago right here in New Haven. This is New Haven isn't it? New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America?Well I was with this girl backstage, y'know. We got to talking and we wanted some privacy, so we went into this shower stall. We weren't doin' anything y'know jes' standing there and talking....and then this little man came in there, this little man in a little blue suit and a little blue cap...And he said -- \"Whatcha doin' there?\" I said, \"nuthin'\" and he said, \"Well you better get outta there or...\" \"Or what\" I asked him...And he started pushing me and I pushed back and he didn't like that so he reached back there and got out his little can of mace. And sprayed it right in my eyes. And blinded me. Why? Cause I was alone in a room with a lady doing what he would like to be doing if he could ever get it up without a gun.In the United States of America. Land of the free. Home of the Brave man -- in God We Trust right? TURN OFF THE LIGHTS.Say your thing man!HEY... HEY! HEY!GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME SLAVE!YOU'RE SLAVES. YOU'RE ALL A BUNCH OF SLAVES. THIS ISN'T HAPPENING TO ME MAN, THIS IS HAPPENING TO YOU!!!You finished? You sure you're finished? Haven't you forgotten something -- the consolation prize they gave ya for taking your cock and balls? The guns. Why don't you use em you withered dicks! You shit- eating red-neck chickenshit bastards, I hope this makes your worthless lives...You better kill me cause I'm gonna come back and fuck everyone of your daughters...I drink so I can talk to assholes. This includes me. Let's just say I was testing the bounds of reality -- that's-all -- I was curious... I kinda always preferred to be hated. Like Erich Von Stroheim in the movies... the man you loved to hate... it's meant to be ironic, courage wants to laugh. Y'know it's essentially a stupid situation. I go out on a stage and I howl for people. In me they see what they want to see -- some say the Lizard King, whatever that means, or some black-clad leather demon whatever that means... but really I think of myself as a sensitive, intelligent human being but with the soul of a clown which always forces me to blow it at the most crucial moment... a fake hero... a joke the gods played on me... it's okay, I accept the joke... and smile. Death old friend, death and my cock, I can forgive my injuries in the name of wisdom, luxury, romance. Words got me the wound and will get me well. All join now in lament of my cock, a tongue of knowledge in the feathered night. Boys get crazy in the head and suffer. I sacrifice my cock on the alter of silence.Nah, later...Now listen to this I'll tell you about Texas Radio and the big beat soft driven slow and mad like some new language reaching your head with the cold sudden fury of a divine messenger let me tell you about heartache and the loss of God wandering, wandering in hopeless night out here on the perimeter there are no stars out here we is stoned, immaculate... but I tell you this: No eternal reward will forgive us now for wasting the dawn.Alive she cried! Right Dog, another cubic centimeter of chance Ugh, I can't eat this stuff, it'll really make me sick. Gimme a Dos Equis will ya Delores? And a Ramos gin fizz with it.Let's go... Right now!A triple, Tom, shem and shaun......all of us direct it! In black and white. Call it \"Zero.\" A real road movie! Two of these you feel a lot better.That's all right. I like itI LOVE L.A. -- the best neon. City of Night! City of Light... why are you going to work? You're not slaves, you're free, cars, you're free...You gotta fail to succeed Tom, gotta surrender to the waiting tides.Man, I been here all the time... over there watching. I'm really happy for you Ray you found life...Safflower oil, sure.Yes....cause you lost it. It's fun to walk, isn't it.Which car?Oh yeah... I wrecked it.No Ma I ain't drinking.No Ma I ain't.I don't know 'bout that.Uh -- just some low grade acid. It's not heavy. Pam, read my mind.Hey it's okay, it's okay... come on, we'll trip and then eat our feast.Come on baby, y'know it's a good thing for Ray and Dorothy I think women are such noble creatures -- they carry on your name with dignity after you die.I think women basically have a comic approach to life -- I mean how can they not when they look up in the dark and see a dangling penis, seeking entry. It looks like a face y'know -- little beard \"Hi mom\" I wanna get inside you. Look around. \"Do the funky chicken, do dah, dah, funky chicken do da da \"love my girl\" --Let's go wild child, let's get out there Romeo and Juliet, Marilyn Monroe and Vincent Van Gogh, Jim and Pam, rock and roll ...all the poetry has wolves in it, but one Pam -- the most beautiful one of all -- dances in a ring of fire and throws off the challenge with a shrug'cause I'm the poet and you're my museGet some drinks, man.

And it was nice of you to bring your friend. I want to keep seeing both of you but it can't be all the time y'know. It would be a night every few weeks or so. That's just the way I am, I'm not dependable. I can't be a boyfriend. Would you do that? I mean could you handle it? That way? I don't want you to get hurt....do you love me?...Well, just think about it awhile. Call me when you get your new number... Hey that's a really nice outfit you're wearing, you really have good taste in clothes. How long have you two been friends?What?Come back later! Who is it!Whyn't you come back later.

If you want the abortion I'll pay for it and I'll come up to New York to be with you when you have it.Yes I will.Please don't say those things to me, Patricia.Well uh, it's designed to wear you down y'know... when that rap sheet says the \"United States of America versus You\" it takes you down day by day, specially when no one really gives a shit about, y'know, the First Amendment that's on trial here... Nobody says anything about that, it's just uh did you take your pants off y'know, I mean that's not what it's about, it's about freedom, that's what it's about... but who cares, right? Freedom exists in a schoolbook.Well, I can only open doors, M'am. I can't drag people thru 'em. I'm no savior.Did I? Well, I'll tell ya, my words stand a far better chance of being around a hundred years from now than my waistline.You're drinking with number three.I think I'm having a nervous breakdown.Whatcha worried about? I like it out here.Life on the edge baby. Come get me if you love me baby.YOUR WHOLE LIFE'S BULLSHIT! YOU LOVE ME THEN COME AND GET ME.Come on baby, come on.Don't have an ending Ray.Come on baby, come on\"I see your hair is burning. If they say I never loved you, you know they are a liar!\"All the poetry has wolves in it Pam!!!C'mon Pam, this is it! We'll do it right here! Right now! You and me!We can. Right now. Just one more step...There was preserved in her the fresh miracle of surprise... clothed in sunlight restless in wanting dying of fever married to doubt how it has changed you how slowly estranged you solely arranged you beg for your mercy -- OR -- ...but all will pass lie down in green grass and smile and muse and gaze upon her smooth resemblance to the mating-Queen who it seems is in love with the horseman Tomorrow we enter the tomb of my birth I want to be ready.Eek Dorothy! You cut your hair!What -- was your hair getting in the way? Where are the kids?Hey -- am I late or is this the cool remnant of a dream?How's my girl! And how's my boy!For you... Pancho gets this one... Melanie -- yours... Hey Dorothy don't grab now... open that one, that's yours... keep your paws off that now......and to you, princess, from your Royal servant, James Douglas MorrisonNo, I gotta plane to catch.Forever young...I gotta admit -- that ain't bad for four guys who weren't even talking that day.Yeah John, be anonymous, write a book: \"Observations of an American While on Trial in Miami\".I'm pinned man. Everything I do they got a category for it, y'know. Freedom's gone.You can always whip the horses' eyes. You, John, miss me?Yeah, yeah -- and you lay off those drugs Rob. We're gonna play again some day.So what are you gonna be when you grow up?I don't know, can I afford you? Pam kinda wiped me out with her dress store y'know...You know I've never been happier. Not as much of a rush as I used to be in y'know... this is the strangest life I've ever known.O?... splittling headache from which the future is made.Sure. The Count's there so where else would she be? Gotta try to start over, without all the hassles, y'know. I think we can.Well she is kinda flakey -- like me. I mean she's just so vulnerable about everything. It makes me sad man. But she's always kinda believed in something about me y'know -- her little picture of me as the unsung poet -- and it's a fantasy I kinda dig y'know, 'stead of the one I live.We didn't break thru Ray, we just pushed things a little. When you really break thru, there's nothing left. No music, no Doors, no God, nothing -- only a will to power.And now what?It was white Ray. You gotta stop harpin' on that day. I was so ripped I can hardly remember it.Come on man, I gotta fly.In that year we had a great Visitation of energy Back in those days Everything was simpler and more confused One summer night, going to the pier I ran into two young girls The blonde was called Freedom The dark one Enterprise We talked And they told me this story.Aw right. Let's get some tacos!They are waiting to take us into the severed garden do you know how pale and wanton thrillful comes death at a strange hour? Unannounced unplanned for like a scaring overfriendly guest you've brought to bed? Death makes angels of us all? And gives us wings where we had shoulders smooth as raven's claws...No more money, no more fancy dress this other kingdom seems by far the best until its other jaw reveals incest and loose obedience to a vegetable law. I will not go I prefer a feast of friends to the giant family...Well, I'll tell you a story of whiskey, mystics and men And about the believers and how the whole thing began First there were women and children obeying the moon Then daylight brought wisdom and sickness too soon... the moon is a dry blood beast We have assembled inside this ancient and insane theatre to propagate our lust for life and flee the swarming wisdom of the streets we live we die and death not ends it FATHER HAVE MERCY!!!Bird of prey, bird of prey Flying high, flying high in the summer sky Bird of prey, bird of prey

Hello I love you Let me jump in your game She's walking down the street Blind to every eye she meets Do you think you'll be the guy To make the queen of the angels sigh?She holds her head so high Like a statue in the sky Her arms are wicked And her legs are long When she moves My brain screams out this songSidewalk crouches at her feet Like a dog that begs for something sweet Do you hope to make her see you, fool? Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?She lives on Love Street Lingers long on Love Street She has a house and garden I would like to see what happensShe has robes and she has monkeys Lazy diamond studded flunkies She has wisdom and knows what to do She has me and she has youWell the clock says it's time to close now I guess I'd better go now...

No bliss! No bliss!Morrison... Aw shit. Last trip I thought I was going through hell's digestive system. Something painted by Hieronymus Bosch.I like naturally high man.Well I saw the head of production and I said Godard doesn't use scripts, he improvises with his camera and he said, \"great who's Godard?\"Right on. I thought you went to New York?Whatcha been doing?Songs? Lemme hear one.So neither can Dylan. \"Johnny's in the basement mixing up the medicine, I'm on the pavement thinking about the government\". But he's got the words man. That's what they want.Wow!... Y'know man those are hot lyrics -- really hot!Are you kidding! I could fly. You wrote that? You got others?Man. You got a voice like Chet Baker -- haunted! What the hell happened to you in the desert? Let's get a rock and roll band together man and make a million bucks.It's the perfect time man! Two of the guys outta my band are really into this. I meditate with them. You know them... Robbie and John. We could have it in the can in three weeks.The Stones did it outta the London School of Economics for Chrissake. Things are about to explode man. You can feel it in the air. Vietnam's right out there. Sides are being chosen. People wanna fight or fuck, love or kill, everything's gonna flame. The planet's screaming for change, Morrison. Make the myths man!!What do we call ourselves. \"Dionysus\"?What?The Doors? That's the most ridiculous... ...you mean the doors in your mind?

The four of us do everything unanimously or we don't do it.He's just getting his confidence.How does it feel?\"Whiskey's\" next, I can feel it in my bones.Right on stud. But you better watch out for the guys.I'm in pain man. I want something from the peyote. I feel the universe functioning perfectly but I'm still perfectly locked inside myself. Instead of Oneness, I feel total Isolation. Aloneness. Fear... Pain... Jim, all I feel is pain.JERRY JERRY... He was talking about Oedipus! GREEK TRAGEDY!! It's ART!!Oh sure, hi.Yeah?I'd rather stay the same color.It's only a word man. The Stones changed...Jim said to me once, the history of rock and roll's like Greek drama or caveman stories. The audience comes to see ancient rituals in ancient caves. Their souls in jeopardy. They're not watching any longer, they're participating -- and everything's in play, your life, your death...Have you bothered to read the poetry ma'm? You keep denying that anything good can come from L.A., I mean isn't that kind of a provincial attitude? That Bob Dylan's the only poet cause he's from the East Coast, but you won't even look past Jim's goddamn looks at the words man!Come on, we're splitting man. Dorothy's waiting at the door. We'll get a bite at Max's and...Yeah can we meet him, he's great... just like he is. You wanna meet him?Yeah sure, he's cool, come on, he's your hero!Come on Jim, let's go.I could never keep up with you Jim.

Another JFK.Where the fuck you been man?Okay Jim let's eat that duck.JIM! COME ON. GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF!JIM!! WILL YOU STOP THIS SHIT WILL YOU STOP!! WILL YOU GET SANE!!Alright, let's try something else.Now, Jim...It's not like a big deal Jim, the song's already been commercialized, the money was great. Robbie wrote the lyrics and he didn't mind, neither did I, neither did John... we gotta get to TV.I don't think so Jim. There's a bigger picture here.Bill's with him. They're an hour away, he'll get him here.You think it's easy for him. He moves left he's got vice squad, on the right narcs -- and the audience just waiting for him to get busted.Compassion was never your forte man.The wine man, the ancient wine. The ancient wine.Something he once told us. About Dionysos. When the madness took over...JOHN, C'MON!!JOHN!! STOP IT!! COME ON!!Come on man.We'll talk tomorrow, we'll settle it. Just do it tonight man and...HEY JIM.\"The band you love to hate\".Pam!! Oh shit... get the ambulances man...JIM! HELP HER. She's gonna fall.Jim we gotta finish \"LA Woman\".They're both gonna die... ARE YOU HAPPY YOU COCKSUCKERS!!You wanna hear the new mixes on \"LA WOMAN?\"...Gotta plane to catch man?Is Pam really there in Paris waiting?I never knew what you saw in that nightmare chick man.I don't know man, I don't wanna sound like your old man but you're only 27, you're living like you gotta get it all in, you gotta slow down man, you did it, you broke thru to the other side.I don't believe that. You were an American prince, man -- with overbred genes -- No! What could've been Jim? You could've been President. No man! What could've been Jim? We stood here on this beach on the edge of the Pacific that crazy summer day in '65 -- and we knew, you and I, we knew we were at the edge of the mind. we were there, man.

I did. I had a friend who was Christ. And he was Judas too. I suddenly knew the secret of everything -- that we're all one, the universe is one. And that everything is beautiful.I think you're alive by recognizing beauty -- seeing truth because when you discover truth you discover what love is... we're all saying the same thing.
