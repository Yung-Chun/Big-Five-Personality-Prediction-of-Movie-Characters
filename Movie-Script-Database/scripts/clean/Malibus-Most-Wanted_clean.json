And so if you elect me governor, I promise to take care of California the same way I take care of my own family; with compassion, caring, kindness, and most of all, with an interest in everyone. My friends... 'California is my family!' The crowd cheers and waves \"Gluckman For Governor\" signs.Speaking of family, I'd like to introduce my wife Bess... Bess smiles and waves.... and my daughter, little Brenda. Brenda smiles and waves like a campaign-trail veteran.Any questions? The press begins shouting questions. Bill picks...Deb? REPORTER #1 Where's your son?In fifteen minutes?It's a disaster.Thank God.I have no idea. I thought he was out of town.I thought he was at the chalet in Aspen.What are you doing here, son?No, no. I love his enthusiasm... It's just a little misguided. There must be something he can do for the campaign, where he can't hurt us.I don't know... phones, stuffing envelopes, making signs, something. CUT TO:... in Bill Gluckman's administration, women will have better health care, women will have better day care, and women will have better jobs! From here on in, my campaign has a new slogan!Bill Gluckman's down with the bitches and ho's'?No, Tom. I promise you, I will not lose this election over my son.Set up an appointment with my shrink. CUT TO:Dammit, Brad, stop acting like a gang member. You're from Malibu, you live in a nice home...You can't be excused until you do.That's it, mister.What about your bar mitzvah? DISSOLVE TO:Mazel tov, Bradley!Oh stop beating around the bush, Bess. What we're trying to say is, Brad, that your behavior is, well, it's an embarrassment to the family.I'm sorry, but it's the truth.And, Brad... I can't have you on the campaign any longer.Do you think we can bring him back?Great news. If he sees Brad five days a week, he says we'll see improvement in three to four years.Right, good point.I'm all ears.You mean, have Brad actually... go there?Sounds dangerous...How does it work?I don't know... it sounds so drastic.Who do we get for the gangsters?Fellas, instead of thinking of yourselves as what set you're from, or what crew you're rolling with, why can't you both be brothers. What do you say?You see... 'California is my family'... Cut to angle on Bill and the gangbangers playing basketball, having a wonderful time.If we work together as a family there's no telling how high we can go.Will he be safe?I don't know... can't we just... He looks out the window and sees Brad's new banner. It reads, in graffiti colors: \"ELECTION ERECTION.\"Alright, fine, just do it.Terrific. How's the Brad project doing?And he's okay?Oh... CUT TO:... oooooo...... oooooo...Bradley's been involved in a gang shooting.His face was on the news, Tom! I think I know my own son!Sleep? He's shooting the hell out of South Central. We've got to get him!Forget the debate!You can shove the campaign up your ass, Tom! I will not lose my son over this election!A positive!You're trying to get votes out of this?I'm his father.I guess right now. Bill grabs Tom by the shirt and slams him into the wall.You're fired. As Bill takes off:I need a location on license number...Brad! Are you okay?Hey there, fellas. Bill Gluckman... I'm running for governor.I absolutely recognize that street violence is tearing Californians apart... You see, guys, California is my family, and hey, here's a thought. Instead of thinking of ourselves as what set we're from, or what crew we're rolling with, why can't we just be brothers? What do you say?I didn't know anything about that. You've got to believe me, that was not part of the plan.It was stupid, I know. I thought I'd tried everything... I just didn't know how to deal with you anymore.I'm not proud of myself, Brad. I made a lot of mistakes, and I know I wasn't there for you, and I can't change that, but I always loved you and still do...... and if you say this is really who you are, then I believe you and accept you, and from here on in, I promise to be a real father to you.I'm here, ain't I? Brad looks at him. Bill looks back. Everyone looks on, riveted.Much love. They pound.Hey, kids... Sorry to interrupt.Well, I'm about to go on and, Brad... I want you to be part of this.I need you to help me get the urban vote. Introduce me.And, son, don't say it... Rap it.This is a monumental day for our glorious state and there are several people I need to thank here tonight... There's the International Brotherhood of Police Officers... APPLAUSE, as POLICE OFFICERS salute Bill.The Southern California Rotary Club... A table full of well-dressed PROFESSIONALS wave politely.And our friends at the Environmental Defense Fund... A group of granola-type ENVIRONMENTALISTS smile. Brad CLEARS HIS THROAT, causing Bill to look at him. Brad gives Bill a \"reminder\" nod...Oh, and of course... PULL BACK TO REVEAL: We're actually in the PROUD BIRD...... all the Bitches and Ho's...The Pimps... The Hoodrats... The lavishly-dressed PIMPS raise their canes to Bill.The Association of Korean Grocers. An ASIAN FAMILY give Bill the \"thumbs-up.\"The Playas. The Ballers. The Shot Callers.

What's up all you media people?! This is B-Rad G, kickin' it real from the 'bu, represizzin'!!! Four fine white girls in bikini tops, vinyl shorts and Timberlands come out and dance behind Brad, shaking everything they've got.

DISSOLVE TO:Nope.It's O.P.P., bitch! Brad exits through French doors, and as we FOLLOW him OUTSIDE NAUGHTY BY NATURE'S \"O.P.P.\" KICKS IN.Yo, Pops, that hurts my feelings.Don't be hatin'.What?! Oh that's how it is? A'ight then. I'm Audi! I need to take a drive.What's up?Gladys?Ever feel like you don't belong?What do you do about it?Yeah, you right... Gladys, when they gonna leave our people alone?Oh no, not again! He gets up and runs out of the room. CUT TO:Lemme go.What happened?Why didn't you stop him?How many did he do?Damn. Twelve Frapachizzo's. Brotha's caffeined out. Move aside.Just chill, Hadji, we're here to help. What's up?It's on now! MUSIC: PUBLIC ENEMY'S \"Fight The Power\" KICKS IN as we -- CUT TO:Dis is our mall. Always was and always will be!You better be validatin' my parking?Dat's what I'm talkin' 'bout. We get ours! CUT TO:I'm thin to win! 'The name is B-Rad, Not Robbie Van Winkle... Go get my latte nonfat, And don't forget the sprinkle!' They pound and congratulate Brad on his brilliance. Shondra drops her shades back down and moves in. Hadji sees her first. His jaw drops, then he tugs on Mocha's shirt, whose jaw drops, then Mocha tugs on Brad's shirt.Yo, what up, fool? I'm --Let me get them tig ol' bitties.Yo, Krista the Barista. Put it on my account. Get yourself a blueberry scizonne too, girl.I ain't seen you in here before. Where you reside?The streets.Malibu... Represent. Bard throws the \"M\" sign.Hell yeah. I'm down with the P.C.H. Hustlers. And dems over dere... Brad points to three white wannabes in another corner.The Calabasis Crabs... and behind dem... We PAN TO another table, where four thug posers sit.... the Palaside Pimps.All day every day. She smiles seductively.Hell yeah, I'm a rhyma on tima... Brad hands her his CD.I'm holdin' out for Power 106. I sent Big Boy a CD, he just ain't gotten back to me yet.Hold dup? You know Big Boy?For rizzill?!Yo. Holler at him for me.Now? Well, tonight was my Seder dinner...Let's bounce.Yo, y'all, this fine dimey is hookin' me up with Big Boy hisself.I ain't lyin'! They pound, shake, hug.Start droppin' beats. Soon as I sign with Biggy, we gonna need some sick tracks.Oh, I can rap about anything.Yeah, lemme kick it freestyle. 'Traffic, traffic, Lookin' for my Chap Stick, Feelin' kinda carsick, There's a Ford Maverick...' See? Dat's a million-dollar song right dare.I been a playa all my life, girl. And I must say, of all the sisters I been wit', you de finest. So, you got a man?Word. What's that?Oh.That's genius, girl. Damn. You fine and smart too. You gonna blow up huge, no doubt. She's taken aback by his sincerity. She doesn't get much validation from guys.For real, girl. You like a cross between Martha Stewart and Oprah. I'ma call you Mothrah. She gives him a strange look, then notices where they are.Yo. He really should use delivery. Suddenly Sean pops his head into the car and stares directly at Brad. He puts a prop Tec 9 in Brad's chest and yanks him out of the car.What?!Shondra?!Dis a come-up?!I think I'm gonna throw up.Does this mean we're not going to Big Boy's?Kidnapped?!How you know me?Dang. Why you doin' this to a brother?Yours, y'all. I'm down.B.E.T.I'm sorry. Don't be hatin'.Uh... just this... Brad pulls out another pager, a phone, another phone. Sean and PJ both pull several more out of his other pockets, as well as his wallet.Oh yeah. I just been kidnapped, carjacked, hands tied behind my back, but other than that, it's all good.I thought you liked me.Then how come you set me up?For real?For Real?!I feel you, girl, me too.Me? But I hate posers! I got a Ph.D. -- a Poser-Hater Degree.I ain't fron'in'.Damn. I am who I say I am. Why won't anyone believe me? This is a issue that's been comin' up a lot in my life lately.Huh?What? Straight up?Come on, y'all, quit hatin'. I'm just a rapper, that's it.I'd like some Pringles.I'm sorry, I'm sorry... y'all got some duckets, 'cause I'm tapped.But...Okay, a'ight, I'll do it.I feel you. Brad sticks the prop gun into his pants and gets out. As soon as he's in the store, Sean and PJ burst into laughter.Yeah, uh, where the Old English at?Thank you, sir. Brad hurries to the back of the store, and spots a door by the beer cooler. He tries to open it. It's locked. Brad looks up to the security mirror and sees that the Korean Guy is watching him. He moves to the beer cooler and tries to calm down.Namyoho renge kyo, namyoho renge kyo, namyoho renge kyo and whatnot... It's not working. Brad tries a cleansing breath. It doesn't help either. Brad gathers up an armful of Old English 40s and heads for the front. The Korean Guy watches him as he walks past the counter toward the door.Naaw, but I'ma help myself to all this O.E., and whatever else I want!Let me axe you something. Ever been robbed?Cool. He sets the 40s on the counter, then reaches into his waistband for his gun, and we... CUT TO:My emergency stash. Thank you God. He pulls out a hundred and kisses it.Keep the change.Uh, I know this is gonna sound wack, but what I'm about to do is just a joke, so don't shoot me, okay?That's right! Next time I'll bust a cap in yo trick ass!Let's dip!Straight up. Trick didn't do nothin'.I stole that too! CUT TO:Who you callin' boy?What do you mean, get real?!Okay, a'ight, chill. Brad takes a deep sigh, looks them in the eye, and begins to talk like a conservative white guy.I guess I now know I can never be as cool as you guys. I promise I will never, ever front or act like a thug again, and I'm really really sorry if I offended you.Great, fine. Terrific popcorn. SCARY MUSIC KICKS IN; Brad's eyes snap back to the screen. He struggles to contain himself. The MUSIC INTENSIFIES, we hear FOOTSTEPS, then a DOOR HANDLE TURNING, and Brad can't hold on any longer. He leaps up, screaming...Run, bitch, ruuuuuuuuuuuuuun!!! He gonna kiiiiiilllllll you! Other Patrons turn and angrily \"shush\" Brad. Sean and PJ lock eyes: he failed the test. CUT TO:I'm sorry, y'all, but this is just who I am. I'm a rapper straight- up.No, for real. I can rap about anything. 'Bloodbath and Tree, hang all day, They real tight, but they ain't gay... No, they okay...'Represent.Finally, a place where I feel at home.What up, girl?! He gives her a sloppy kiss on the cheek.I'm fine, but you the finest! She a genius too, man! I'm tellin' you, one she gets set up, Mothra gonna blow up like Rosie O'Donnell's head!Damn, man. Don't you know how to treat a lady? That's not nice.Don't be hatin'.Auuuuuuuuu! Tec feels everyone looking at him. Now is not the time. He releases Brad and composes himself.I'm okay. Who was that?Damn Shondra, where's the fire at?You settin' me free?Shondra, I gots to do 'dis. this is my shot. I gotta prove myself. Shondra can't argue. Brad starts to the stage. A WAVE OF SHOCK, as the crowd realizes who B-rad actually is.Tizzaizzlszzs! Everyone is totally confused.Tails... I want tails. The MC flips and \"tails\" it is.Nah... Ladies first.Can we start again? I lost my place. TAUNTS and LAUGHS as the beat plays again. Brad wags his head, ready to come in strong. He looks down at his notes... He's sweating so badly his arm is a mess of runny ink. He freezes again... The crowd is really on him now -- collectively making the \"choke\" sign.I'm cool... I'm cool. Brad finally starts up.'You big and rough, You act all tough, I bet in your childhood You never had much love. Alert the media, I'm a rap encyclopedia, My shrink says I suffer from a case of gansta-phrenia, I'm tryin' to be meania, I'm feeling much vigor, I'm the \"Bu's\" number one, hardcore NIGGAA!!!I'm sorry... The crowd erupts with outrage and rushes the stage. SMASH CUT TO:WAILS with terror as he's passed hand-over-hand above the CURSING CLUB PATRONS, toward the exit. Four THUGS run Brad out of the back door, into the...I just want to go home.I don't care no more. I got nothin' to live for. Go ahead and smoke me. Brad gets in the car. Sean and PJ look at each other -- this isn't what they expected. CUT TO:Huh?I ain't never seen no talking rat before. Although at the Malibu County Fair they had a chicken that played tic tac toe. Man, I hated losing to that chicken.I'm a failure.For real?So you saying if I put my mind to it I can be whatever I want to be?I could be a highstylin' pimp?I could drive a mad '63 El Camino with 43-inch gold-plated dubs and a trunk full o' bitches?And I could be the biggest rapper in the world.It's worse. Everybody's right. My rhymes is weak.I should've run when you gave me the chance.But you heard 'em laughing. I ain't nothin' but a busta.Yeah?Like, when the public be all up in your private beach?Thanks, Shondra. You know what I was sayin', earlier, in the car, about being a playa and all? Well... I was just foolin'. I never been with a sister before.Except for on the internet.I think you about the finest girl I ever met in my whole life, and, well, since they gonna ice me in the morning, I was wondering... could I, kinda like, kiss you? She thinks, smiles, then sits down next to him on the bed. Brad sits up and looks at her face in the moonlight.You're so pretty.I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm chill. She rolls her eyes and leaves. Brad falls back on the bed, a dreamy smile on his face.Totally chill. CUT TO:Damn... they been playin' me all along. How could dey do dat? How could she do dat? What-ever. If them fools wanna play, then let's play. He heads for the door, bad-ass and hardcore.Hey! Listen up... Brad G is in da hiz, and things gonna start changin' round here!You feelin' froggy, den leap! Sean backs down.Anyone else wanna step?Shut up, ho.Yo, ho, the same ho that gave up that weak-ass kiss five minutes ago in the bedroom.I'm B-Rad G, from 'Bu, representin'! What y'all don't realize is that I was tryin' to put my mobbin' days behind me, but rollin' with y'all done re-awoke my inna killa. Let's start droppin' bodies! Shondra, PJ and Sean watch, stunned, as Brad grabs a prop gun, his car keys and heads out.I need to take a drive.Today is a good day to die, didn't have to use my A.K... Yey yey!Might as well go out in a blaze of glory. My daddy don't love me, my rhymes is played. I ain't down enough for y'all --Oh, you dat weak fuck from de club. Tec can't believe what he's hearing.Got somethin' for me?Ain't that a coinky-dink? I was just talkin' to my homies about just dat...A'ight, but y'all should change up your style, cuz these jackings is gettin' tired. He heads for Tec's car.Yo, Bloodbath, if there's one tiny scratch on my ride, I'ma eat y'all's children. Shotgun!God damn that hurts!!! I get out of this I'ma hafta teach y'all some manners!Yeah, yeah, tell me somethin' I don't know!You heard me, you half-steppin' moist-ass bitch! Tec cocks his nine and aims at Brad.Oh what, you gonna do me like this? A'ight, then bring it.Man up! Put this wannabe out of his misery.That gat's real, right? Then do it or I'll do it myselfPunks. Gimme dem gats. Brad grabs the Uzis and rolls out from under the car.Y'all wanna play? Let's play! You know who you're dealin' with??? He jumps up on the hood of Tec's car and OPENS FIRE with both Uzis, laying down a withering rain of lead.I'm B-Rad G, from the 'BU, y'all... King Kong ain't got nothin' on me! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Damn. These special effects are the bomb! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!! The Rollin' G's try to respond, but Brad's fire is too intense.It's safe now, y'all. Tec emerges from behind the dumpster. The crew rolls out from under the car, followed by Sean and PJ. They look at Brad in awe. They're impressed.Damn. Jus' MTV.For real? You shouldn't have.In a box... right. Brad laughs. They all join in, laughing hard as we -- CUT TO:Yeah, I just got tested positive ... for G.A.M.E. SISTER #1 Cool playa. SISTER #2 Let's get busy. They laugh when suddenly Shondra comes through the door.What?!Damn, why you throwin' salt on myI ain't goin' nowhere. I'm a I-9 neow, straight-up. Peep my tat. Brad lifts his shirt and shows her the tattoo on his stomach: I-9 THUG.Shut up, Shondra! I know y'all set me up, I know it's all fake, de kidnap, de stickup, de whole nizzy.Why'd you play me, huh?What you need money Money?! Tch. for?Please. You prob'ly still flippin' me anyway, so --Oh really? Well if Tec is real then this gat must be real... Brad pulls his nine.And if this gat is real then the in it have got to be real. caps And seein' how my foot is real, this would really hurt... then Brad aims at his foot and pulls the trigger and BLAM! He puts a BULLET through the toes of his sneaks.See dat. I just shot myself in the foot and... It's reaaaaalll! It's totally reaaaaalll!!! Brad starts hopping around the room.I just shot my foot!! I just shot my foot!!!Oh gaawwwd!But, it's real, Shondra, it's all reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeal! Tec enters, gun in hand.Ha ha, Tec, my road dawg, yeah, just the man I wanta see.Yo, dawg, love to kick it wit' you and run the whole thizang, but I got some bidness back in the 'Bu, li'l somethin' somethin' with Big Boy and whatnot, so if y'alls don't mind --Wait, Tec, lemme explain, 'cause I don't belong here...Please, don't be hatin'. Shondra steps in front of Brad.Not really. And unless you seriously strapped, you about to be not really okay too. Bill turns: six I-9s are aiming guns at he and Brad.Hold dup, y'all. Before anybody ices anybody I got to say something. No one stops him, so Brad turns to his dad.You really weren't gonna pay my ransom?What was the plan? Send me down here to scare me white?You've never known how to deal with me 'cause you don't know me, and you never cared to find out. And now that your election's on the line, that's when you take a stand? That's bullshit, Pops. Look at me, 'cause this is who I am, and if you can't accept that, then I'll walk out that door, never see your sorry-ass again. Shondra, Tec, all the I-9's and Brad's posse slowly turn from Brad to Bill, completely caught in the moment, waiting for his response.Talk is cheap, Pops. Prove it.A'ight, Pops, we cool.Tec, before we all go out in a blaze of glory, can I say one last thing?Moch, kick it freestyle. Mocha rests the musket in the crook of his arm, and does his human beat box thing as Brad begins to rap.'What's up with all this fightin'? We all should be unitin'! Y'all egos need deflatin', Gangstas, please, quit all this hatin'.'A'ight, cool, but all these gats got to go! As Brad grabs the missile launcher from Hadji...Aaah!!!I'm cool... still a little confused maybe. I'm still not exactly sure what was for real and what wasn't.I can deal with a little more of that reality. They kiss again, then Brad breaks it.Wait a minute. You said two things was real. What was the other? Shondra smiles as we...Damn, you knew Big Boy the whole time?Peep dis. He hands over a Mali-Bootay CD.Once you hear my demo, you're gonna want to give me Eminem play, dawg!Damn. Twenty thousand people, all here to support my pops. He must have charisma.Shondra, girl. I just have to thank you.You the only one who accepted me for who I really am. You also car jacked me, kidnapped me and tried to turn me white, but I'm gonna let that go. They kiss, tongues and all as Bill walks up.What up?You mean, be onstage with you?Dang, I'd be honored.For real, Pops?Hey, y'all! I'm here to introduce you to my father, Bill Gluckman! The big Gluck!! A rap beat kicks in as Brad goes all out.We all gather here on this special occasion. To listen to my pops, he's your west coast liaison. A speech from him, dude, is like sex with a hoochi. It's hot and excitin', like shoppin' at Gucci! Asians, Jews, Mexicans, too. Everybody's votin', yo, it's a cultural stew. Once he's in office you'll experience great riches. As a thank you for helpin', you can get wit my bitches! Let's get Glucked! Y'all get Glucked! We get Glucked! Come on everybody put your hands up! Bill moves onstage and attempts to dance hip hop style.Immigration, education, and runaway inflation. It got me so stressed I need to start masturbatin'. California ain't flowin' like some ol' constipation. Vote for dad or I'll bash your frickin' face in! Come on everybody put your hands up!I helped Shondra open up her salon right here in the 'Bu.She styled up all the ladies in Malibu so they were stone-cold ghetto fabulous. Shondra spins the chair to REVEAL: BEES GLUCKMAN with a crazy ghetto hairstyle. She looks like Busta Rhymes. She checks herself in the mirror.West Coast Reprezzizzin'! Bill and Brad hug. HIP HOP MUSIC KICKS IN and the entire Ballroom turns into one huge dance party. Bill raises the roof as he meanders into the celebrating crowd. People of all different races and backgrounds dance together, all having a blast... Hadji grinds on an ELDERLY CONSTITUENT's ass... she's into it.Yo, yo, yo... Everyone turns to see Brad still at the podium. Confusion...Last time I was here, y'all threw my ass out. But now that I haves yo attention, I gots somethin' I gotta say...

Tom hands them a checklist/itinerary.So we hold him for ransom?Why don't you have him steal some watermelon while you're at it?Wait -- we're kidnapping him, couldn't we get arrested?Cris... tal.... As the driven snow.Yeah, but it's totally dangerous, dude. You know what it's like in the 'hood. We could get shot!You know what really chaps my ass?

MALL FOOD COURT - WIENIE IN A BUN - CLOSE ON SHONDRA - DAY in a Wienie In a Bun uniform, chewing gum and looking like she's smelling something nasty.Like work at Wienie In A Bun?Do this, Shondra. You'll get some real money so you can quit this minimum wage crap and start up your business.A grand.Jesus Christ, three grand?They have everything we ordered?What the hell is that?No. I just think it's a choice my character would have made.Whatever. DISSOLVE TO:Okay, got the gangsta wear.What's so funny?Whatever.Gimme your ride, punk, or I will dust yo ass!Yeah, I know, I'm having trouble finding this one. Lemme try it again. Gimme your ride, punk, or I will dust yo ass!Gimme yo ride, punk, or I will dust yo ass... beeyotch!You're gettin' jacked! Move!No. It's a stickup.You jus' been kidnapped.

And your perpetratin' ass is stealin' the only thing I got -- my culture!You a long way from the beach now, punk! You in South Central. The ghetto. The 'hood. It's hard core up in here! People here die every day! Two LITTLE GIRLS are walking by.Mean pit bulls.You got anything else on you, fool?You better pray he home. If he not, you're one dusted trick! Sean, PJ and Shondra exit, slamming the door behind them.Did you buy my rage?I'm indicating?'If he not, you're one dusted trick!' Please!Sure, Shondra, sorry. You're on. Go play good cop. We've gotta call Tom. Shondra rolls her eyes and heads back into the room.Yeah, perfect. Let's take it to another level, my man. He and PJ \"get into character\" and head in.A'ight, we put the call in to yo pops, and you know what he said?Can't see as I blame him.Wigga please! Sean cuts the duct tape with a blade.Come on.I'ma teach this little white girl a lesson!The plan just done changed, Tree. Wannabe claims he down, I'ma show him just how un-down he is. Sean yanks Brad out by his collar. CUT TO:A'ight, Malibu, go get us six 40s of O.E.This ain't a picnic, bitch!You about to go up in there and give this Korean bitch yo ends? Hell no.And if the Asiatic gives you any static, show the brotha this... He hands Brad one of the prop guns -- a Glock. It's heavier than Brad thought. He drops it.Do it, punk, or I'll use that on you.He's gonna run out of there a scared little white boy. They laugh again and pound it. CUT TO:How much did you have to give this guy, anyway?When you set this thing up yesterday, what did you pay?You mean the owner doesn't know this is all fake?Get in there! He could get shot!This can't be happening.You did it?I've about had it, boy!You got about five seconds to get real, or I'ma Timbo stomp your ass to de curb!Act your white self! He shoves a prop gun into Brad's ribs.Five! Four!I can't tell.Let's give him the test. CUT TO:You a'ight, man? Brad snaps out of it for a minute.I done had it with you, fool. You better check yourself before you wreck yourself. This ain't Malibu!Cube, Snoop, they all came up through here.This is definitely gonna do it.How you feelin' now, Malibu?Yo! Sean bumps the DJ table. A vicious look from the DJ, as Sean tries to play it off. The MC just looks at him disdainfully.Maybe a C-Note would open some... equal opportunities?B-rad. From Malibu. The MC makes a face, but puts down Brad's name anyway.What was that? A RUMBLE comes from the dumpster and they pull back the lid. ANGLE ON: Inside the dumpster where Brad lies in the bottom -- his fall was broken by several loaves of old Wonder Bread. PJ and Sean fall into hysterics, as Shondra emerges from the club. She finds PJ and Sean apoplectic with laughter, shakes her head and begins to help Brad out of the dumpster.Hey y'all, check this out. I can rap about anything! Haaa!!Damn. I haven't laughed like that in a long time. 'Fess up, boy, you can't hang.He thinks y'all belong down here in the 'hood with us brothas, seein' how you so 'down' and all.No way.Okay, I'll get it, you know, but settin' everything up was expensive, and I don't exactly have it right now.Alright, okay, just relax... As Sean starts to dial, we -- CUT BACK TO:Your suggestions were really helpful. He totally bought the car jack and kidnapping...... we staged a fabulous liquor store robbery. Mr. Gluckman's going to be very happy... Brad's eyes widen.But, he's still posing, so we wanted to put him in a drive-by shooting next... but, it's a little more money then our original projections... Brad slumps back. He can't believe it.But -- Mr. Gibbons, hello?You must be out yo mind. Get back in that room before I beat your ass!Come on, girl. Let's go!Where the hell you goin'?Why you talkin' crazy?No. You down, right PJ, er, Tree?Oh my God.I'm not Bloodbath! My real name is Sean James, I'm an actor. I swear!No way, man. She's in on the scam, just like us.You've heard of him?Tom, we have a real problem.I know you said that, but we're in real serious troub -- Tec rips the phone out of Sean's hand.Help us, please... I'm... so... Scared!!! Sean begins to wail. Tec yanks the phone back.I haven't seen anything. She moves on. PJ lifts up his bound wrists.See how committed he is? That's the rage I was talking about.See, the explosion was just a metaphor for the anger we oppressed young men of color have buried deep inside our hearts... hearts turned dark --Can I get a copy of this? I need it for my reel. She glares and they move off... We FIND Brad and Shondra by an ambulance, talking as a paramedic bandages Brad's ass.Welcome to Wienie In A Bun.Or perhaps I can interest you in a head shot?

Makin' sick money turnin' all the rich hoochies ghetto fab.Thank you.Take this exit. Brad swerves across three lanes of the freeway to take the exit, and suddenly finds himself actually in South Central. He's awestruck -- he notices a homeless guy with a shopping cart loaded with bags of stuff.Shut up, fool!Okay then.Would you two fools shut the hell up?You a'ight in here?Look, I'm sorry about all that, it wasn't my idea.I do.I had to. They... ... they threatened to kill me if I didn't play along.Oh yeah. They straight-up killas.Lemme school you on something, help you to stay alive, a'ight? The one thing they hate more than anything, that really sets them off, is posers.I'm talkin' 'bout you!Come on. Quit frontin'.Listen to reason. If you just be a nice little white boy and say you're sorry, I think I can convince them to let you go.None of your damn bizness, Tec. Now let go. She yanks her arm away from him.Too busy for you.Hell no.All you need to know is that it ain't you, okay?You a'ight?Brad, don't --Don't do it, Tec!You alright?Old history. Come on. Shondra grabs Brad and moves him to the stairs.You're going home.No. I'm savin' your ass. I'm not havin' your blood on my hands. It's the blue Honda across the street.Wait a second. Brad, don't do it. Brad turns to Shondra, looks at the keys, and shakes his head.This is gonna be like an episode of 'Oz.' Brad gets his game face on and walks the gauntlet on his way to the stage -- an imposing path of intimidating looks.A'ight, y'all had your fun, why don't you chill...Hey... You okay? Brad sniffles.You know, it's not as bad as it seems.You just need a little experience.Naw. You were right. I respected you for getting' up there.They just don't understand you. None of them know how hardcore it is up in... Malibu.Yeah with the... traffic, and the... parking, and...Right. You just got to stick with it, you know, don't let anyone tell you who you are. Brad smiles, looks at her.For real?I never would've known.Thank you. Brad leans in and kisses her tenderly. She kisses him back. Encouraged, Brad opens his mouth wide and tries to stick his tongue down her throat. She pushes him back.I said kiss, fool. Damn.I offered you a snack, not the whole kitchen.A'ight, that's it, this game is lame. I want my money, and then y'all can get out.You ain't never gonna be done. Did it ever occur to you two jackasses that this is the way he really is?Whatever. Look, I did what you asked, and I want my money.Excuse me? You playin' me? Shondra hands Sean the phone.Y'all get me my money now, or I'ma go in there and tell him what's up.What the hell do you think you're doing?What the hell got into you?Who you callin' ho, ho?Who the hell do you think you are?Uhn uhn.
