{"American-Hustle": {"RICHIE DIMASO": {"raw_line": "What are you doing, going behind my back? Telling people I'm screwing up this operation? I got you a suite at the fuckin' Plaza Hotel!Based on what--?What, did you try to dress me so I would look like him?But I do, I look like him.Hey, look, I never laid a hand on her, all right? Is that what this is about?Look, we never had sex ok? I just --What'd I do? I put my hand like this --Oh it does?That bothers you?You know, a lot of shit bothers me too, but I was trying to help you. If I wanted to bother you, if I really wanted to fucking bother you, this is what I'd do.How's that? You bothered now? Alright, don't make a thing of it.Oh my god, fix his hair. Don't make a thing of it.Big fucking deal. We got to get in the other room, come on. The mayor's in there.Should we go to the beauty parlor? Is that what we should do?Let's go.No, it's for the Mayor. It would be a sign of disrespect to the sheik if the mayor didn't take it himself. It's for you Mayor.He's gotta take it himself, okay?Go out there and get him right now.Go get him. He needs to take the fuckin' briefcase, Irving.No, you have no choice. You have to go get him. Now, go get him, so he takes the briefcase by himself! That's the whole plan, Irving!The whole fuckin' thing was falling apart. You know how much I paid for this goddamn hotel that you fucking asked for?!You understand what I'm saying, right? It wasn't working.Richie Dimaso, FBI. Nice to meet you.You gotta get away from this guy.Joe, how come the fluorescents are on? Can we kill that, please? Jesus I put this lamp here for you 'cause I thought it'd be better for you. There's a wire here. They're scared because people hang themselves but I know you're too smart for that. Where's the table and chair? There's no bed here? It's like a fucking asylum. Joe, is everybody off today? Jesus Christ it's scary. Maybe I wanted to scare you. I don't know. Maybe it was my idea. Maybe i'm a little off the beaten path you know? I don't know. You look dehydrated. Here, want to try some tea? Oh yeah, your lips are all chapped. It's herbal. My favorite.I know you think -- look at me. Hey. Edith.I know you think Irv loves you. I know you think you know him -- that he sees the world as a cold, dark place, and he cares about nobody but very few people on his short list: his son, his father, Rosalyn, and you. And you think you're at the top of that list. But what if you're not. What if you're not even on the list at all? He'd be in here right now if he took the check.He'd be in here right now if he took the check. But no, you did. God, it's, it's so clear to me. It's so crazy -- it's clear to me, but it's not clear to you. He uses you, Edith, to protect himself. To protect his son and his wife in Long Island. No? Yes. He put a ring on her finger, he adopted her son. They have huge house, they have two cars. What does she do all day? I'll tell you what she does -- she plays with her nails, she watches T.V., and she spends your money, the money that you make.I don't like that you're in jail while he's going free. I don't like any of that. I want to help you. All the razzle-dazzle that he does, it's not good. It's not real. It's fake. It's not real. Who you are is who you are, between you and God. You and your soul. That's what matters. That's what counts. That's what I'm about. And that's what I see in you. Tell me you didn't feel it the first time we saw each other. Am I crazy? I don't think so. I'm not supposed to be talking like this, but I don't care, I break the rules.Okay, Edith? Edith. I want to help you. I like you. I like you. I like you.Been in there three days. Hasn't been so good for her.How does that make you feel her in there? That check was for you, right? But you knew somethin' was off. That's 'cause you're good. You're, like, the best at what you do in the whole country, aren't you?But you know what? If the country were run by people like you, Irving Rosenfeld we'd be living in Eastern Europe or Guatemala. You ever been in Guatemala? You ever been in jail in Guatemala? You ever try to get a telephone or a permit or anything in Guatemala? That's what this country would be like if we let people, let the liars like you, run this country.My grandmother lived to be ninety- three years old. Never lied in her life.Thank you. I'm proud of that, too. Does that make her not a good person? Is that not something to strive for?I see something in you, Irving. I get very excited. I think that we have a lot of potential here. Now, look. I came up with the idea. It's all from me. I want to change things. I want to go after white collar crime. Irving, you're very skilled. And I want you to teach me and we can do this. I want four people that do what you do. Fraudulent investments. Fake certificates of deposit. Stolen art, fake art. You get me four people and you're off the hook.You're good, you're done. Anything you want. But if you run, then your life is over. You'll be hunted, and it's gonna be very difficult for Rosalyn and your kid to live in this country.An Arab sheik? Why do we need an Arab Sheik?Oh that's good.So if you want to get somebody like your con artist friend -- Carl Elway -- you get him to want to buy--- or sell fake art or stolen art or fake certificates of deposit, he needs -- who does he need? -- he needs a rich sheik guy, and there you go -- we can pinch him!Where?How do you know the Sheik?Yeah, he's good.Wait, what're you talking about? That's impossible.That's a fake?Yeah, I'm Robert Spencer, advisor to the sheik.Something bigger? My guy deals with hundreds of millions of dollars. How much bigger?Huge? Like what? Robert Spencer, advisor to the Sheik.Whose the guy?Whose Carmine Polito?My boss Stoddard proceeded to tell me that Carmine Polito was the most quietly powerful person in the state of New Jersey. A lifetime native of the very racially mixed Camden, which had become a ghetto, and where he had been Mayor for ten years. A very beloved guy. A guy who never gave up on his people. His father had emigrated from Italy and had stoked coal.A big family guy with five kids. They even adopted some other kid. A black kid from the Boys and Girls Club who'd lost his family. I mean, his household was a joyous place. And his wife Dolly, she was the apple of his eye and the center of the household. I mean everyone loved this guy.And he had a huge heart.He worked with all the unions. He was the leader of the State Assembly. And he had just gotten gambling legalized in New Jersey to create jobs.But he couldn't get the funds to rebuild Atlantic City and that was his problem. So with our help, he was about to have his hand in the wrong pocket at the wrong time. And to me that meant corruptShhhh. Look, it's really simple. All you need is to put two million in a Chase account ---- under the Sheik's name --Shh, just listen. Two million dollars under the Sheik's name, in a Chase account that we control. Carmine calls up on the telephone -- calls the bank -- and he sees that the Sheik is real and he has a real account. Five days.Stoddard, let us do what we need to do to rule out corruption and to get rid of the payoff guys that are ruining this country. That's my dream. Don't smother it, please.Holy shit --I understand what's happening. You're saying your brother went out on the ice, the ice was too thin, he fell through the ice, he went in the water because he was too eager, and you're saying I'm too eager -- that's what you're saying?What are you saying?Stoddard shot the whole thing down.Boring.But Edith was a genius.She somehow found this woman who controlled the wire room. A woman I'd never heard of. Way back in a warren buried in the Bureau. This cat lady nobody even talked to. Edith met her in the ladies room and became friends with her. This lady handled all the wires and now, she was working with us.She was excited to be included in an operation instead of being on the other end of a memo. It was beautiful.That's impressive.We got her to wire two million dollars into an F.B.I.-controlled account at Chase. It'd be there for five days and if Polito called he'd see that the Sheik was real.By the time Stoddard caught up to us Edith made sure his boss was impressed by my idea. So before he even knew it was happening his boss was calling to congratulate him.Anthony Amado. He was the U.S. Attorney, and he had a major hard- on to make a name for himself. I mean this guy loved the idea of being famous. And Stoddard had to say it was his own idea or he'd look stupid in front of his boss.You should be happy. There's imaginative things happening in this office, alright? We're not just working in a box.We got the two million to put Carmine and the Sheik together.I liked being on this side of the line. But someone had been left out.You're gonna do this because you got no choice. You work for me.How the hell am I ruining America?No I'm thinking big. This is gonna be fantastic. We're doing video surveillance. I'm doing this from the feet up.How about a suite at the Sheraton Hotel?Why not?Carmine does back door dealings all the time. We don't have a budget for that Irving!Yeah we did it.She showed me.You playing me? Are we doing this? Or you playing him? It'd be very bad for you if you're playing me.This is all very exciting, I never knew life could be like this. You're wild. You know we're taking down a very important politician.This is agent Richard Dimaso, I'm placing $75,000 into this briefcase for Mayor Carmine Polito to procure casino license and building permits for Atlantic City.Who?What?! Without me?!Did you tell him you were working with me? That I'm the Sheik's associate?!Carmine has got to deal with me, Irving.We're gonna use Carmine. We're gonna use Carmine to get other people, that's what we're gonna do.Carmine's gonna use the Sheik to pay off people.We're gonna let Carmine show the Sheik Atlantic City, how he's gonna renovate hotels, and see who shows up. Whoever the Sheik pays off for licenses and casinos, that's who we're gonna go after. We're gonna go after all of 'em!If your that successful, how come you wound up in this room with me? Taking orders from me.Oh my god, what did you do?See, your job is to do the filter, Mom, mine is to do the gravel. When you don't do the filter right all the fish die. See?I've gone over this a hundred times mom --Yeah, hello?Who's this?Are you alright?That's right, he went out with Carmine and his wife. You must not feel so good about that.Oh, no, it's just people.Well, I don't know, no fianc\u00e9e. I don't know.I don't know --I don't. No.Hey, you want to get together?OK, fifty-fourth street.That's what that phone call's about. Everybody thought, \"Oh, Richie DiMaso's gonna stay in the office, pushing papers.\" That's not gonna happen, Mom. I'm outside in the field. I got people working for me. My ideas. I'm running the show. I'm the quarterback. And I'm not gonna settle for no one, Mom.Yeah, no, I don't know.Do you ever think, how did I end up here? How did my life become this? You ever think that? And you wonder, am I ever gonna get to a better place or is this it? You ever feel like that?No, I need this. Please, I need to go dancing with you.Please.I really fucking like you.OK.No more fake shit.I want to be fucking real!I need a jet at Teeterboro.I need a jet at Teeterboro for the sheik.Stoddard, that's not how it works. You got to do it from the feet up.It means you gotta be committed! It means you gotta be committed to something in your life, for Christ's sake. I want a jet at Teterboro for the Sheik. It can be a small jet. It doesn't even have to take off, cause I know you're so worried about how much money the Bureau's gonna fucking spend. It can take off and land on the tarmac, okay?I got the jet?Thank you.So tell me the rest of the ice fishing story.Your father woke you up, it was a blizzard, it was Lake Canoga. Come on!So you tried to protect your brother, but you couldn't and that's why you feel bad, because you're trying to protect me and you're worried about me. Is that what the story's about? About protection?It's not about protection?Alright, fine.Now that's a fucking jet right?That's the kinda moves you need to make.Paco, Richie Dimaso, good to meet you in person [shakes Paco's hand] - this is Irving Rosenfeld.Who?I gotta hire an F.B.I. guy.I am running this but you've gotta listen to him. He's the guy with the vision.I thought you guys broke up. I'm giving you a compliment.Don't worry about it.Sell it.Listen to what he's saying.It's the details. That's what makes this guy a genius.I'm complimenting you. Any other questions?What?Two more federal agents tonight, OK?Yes. They're bodyguards for the Sheik.Look. I'm in charge here, alright? Just do it.Alright?Good night.Confer? What is there to confer about? They're casino guys.We came all this way, Irving. We should be here. What's everybody scared of? There's nothing to be scared of.I love this!How do you do?May I present Sheik Abdullah, gentlemen, from Abu Dhabi. Sheik, these men are professionals, they run the best casinos in the United States.That's not true. I don't know what your talking about. He's got it all wrong.Carmine knows everybody.Wow, that's fantastic.Irving please.Abu Dhabi.Yeah.Uh, I think, I think what he's --Can I use your phone?Last night was insane. I got it all figured out.Listen, I need the Sherman Suite at the Plaza Hotel, okay?I need a whole floor. I need it for my operationI have members of Congress that are gonna come in right now to try to give the Sheik citizenship. They're taking bribes. This is happening right now. That's what's happening right now.Stoddard. Stoddard! Shut up! Listen! Do you know who Victor Tellegio is? Victor. Tellegio. Works for Meyer Lansky. You know who that is?Resorts International! He wants ten million dollars. I have two weeks!Just listen to me! You're not listening to me! I have two weeks! I have two weeks to put this thing together and I need you to get me the Sherman Suite at the Plaza Hotel. And your going to fucking do it!Calm me down baby. You gotta calm me down.Baby let's do this. Let's do this right now. --I want to do this. You're fucking skin is glowing baby. Your skin is glowing.I want to do this now!I love you. I love you. Look at me. I'm in love with you. It is real now. I just said it so now's the time.I'm ready for real.What?What do you mean? What are you doing an accent? An American accent?What are you talking about? Stop it. You're Edith. You're Edith Greensly. I checked your records.You're -- freaking -- me -- out. No, you said in the stall that we were going to be real and that we weren't going to fake it.So -- why -- did you do an English accent after that?Please don't talk about that. I'm confused. I'm confused and ---- I think we should fuck, and then we'll feel it and we won't be confused anymore.Yes! Come on.AHHH!SHIT!What the fuck --You mean Sydney?Irving has a gun.I don't think so.Because when Tellegio finds out what happened, do you think he's gonna go after me? I don't think so. Someone from the Bureau?Think he's gonna go after a politician? He's gonna kill you. Then he's going to go after your son. And Sydney.You're going to give me the Sherman Suite. The whole floor.And you're going to tell me the point of that FUCKING fishing story.What's the matter with you? Where are you right now?Just tell me where the fuck you are.I'm coming to 61st Street. Right now.To beat -- your ass.I am so sorry.I have nothing but the utmost respect for you as my mentor. and as my --I just want to talk from my heart. I don't want it on record. I want to get vulnerable.Of course. I respect you.It's just hard for me to control my passion. I'm a very passionate person. You're from New York. You understand this. He goes ice fishing in the midwest.He's an ice fishing guy. Look at him.What are you doing pulling out your gun? Stop it. That's not you.Don't do something that you don't know anything about. Alright?I'll show you how it's done. I'm not even going to hit you.Watch this fucko.Yes! At the Plaza Hotel.This is where they intersect! This is where the two things intersect. The Politicians and the Mafia. Victor Tellegio's people who run resorts international --Yes. I sat with him. I sat with Victor Tellegio. I hung out with him. We can get him. We can get his whole organization as well as getting any number of congressmen. I mean, that's just peeling the first layer of the onion.We would get ten million dollars and put it into an account --And that's how we just let them know we're for real.He promises to build casinos, handle the skims, do the licencing -Thank you. And Stoddard.What's the end of the ice fishing story?I'm going to call your fucking brother and find out from him.That's how it ends. He fell through the fucking ice.Listen I know it's awkward and I just want to say I'm sorry, alright? I think we can stick together and still fulfill our goal. I mean, we got the Sherman Suite.We got the whole floor, yeah.Yeah, you ok?It's alright. I got hit a little bit. My eye. It's a little blurry but I got drops at the pharmacy.Hey, you OK?Listen, I'm sorry.I'm sorry Irving.You can put a camera here. And we get it all on film. You like it?Give me those flowers.If we put the flower base here and put a camera in there we can get a clear shot of the couch there where we can put the congressmen.And Carmine will go to jail after he delivers us the congressmen soon to be felons.I'm federal agent Richard Dimaso. I've placed seventy-five thousand dollars into this briefcase for Representative John O'Connell of the Ninth District.Representative O'Connell was contacted by Carmine Polito to ask if he could obtain rapid citizenship through an act of Congress for one Sheik Abdullah, investor.How you doing congressmen?The only problem is this citizenship situation.

done, you wanna fuck it up be my guest.Don't you fucking touch me. That bothers me --Oh yeah.Yes.You shouldn't have done that.How's it look.I didn't wanna do it in the first place. This is your show, YOU go get him.What were you doing pushing the fucking briefcase, dummy? Huh?Now I gotta go mop up your mess. I'm gonna go fucking mop up your mess!Did you ever have to find a way to survive and you knew your choices were bad?I learned how to survive when I was a kid.My father had a glass business.I would rather be on the taking side than the getting taken side any day of the week, especially after I saw how my father got taken. I mean, seeing that scarred me for life.I took it upon myself to drum up business. I became a different kind of guy than my father. I became a con artist -- from the feet up, for real.I was gonna survive no matter what. I still had the glass business and a few dry cleaning stores on the side.And I did some art dealing on the side. Stolen or forged art.So, one January I go to my friends pool party in Long Island.Is that Duke Ellington on your bracelet?I know. I doubt anyone else here knows or cares about it.Mine too. Which one?Jeep's Blues. Oh yeah.You wanna hear it?Yeah.Who starts a song like that?!Magic.Like me, she was a very particular person. Like me, she came from a place where her options were limited -- and she had been someone she didn't want to be in her past.Like me, she learned to survive and reinvent herself. She knew she had to reinvent her life and her identity. And like me, she envisioned a better elegant future for herself. Like me, she knew you had to have a vision.She came to New York. She envisioned it.And just like that, she applied for a job at Cosmopolitan Magazine.She was unlike anybody I ever knew. She was smart. She saw through people in situations. And she knew how to live with passion and style. She understood Duke Ellington.-- I got two in the Bronx and three in Manhattan. Hey, Byron.I mean you wouldn't believe the shit that people leave behind here. Unbelievable.Oh yeah. They go out for the night, they drink, come here in the morning, put their clothes in and then they forget. They got no idea where they left it.Look at that. Sequined thing. I don't know. Is that nice or not?I mean, some of it's been here for years. They're not picking it up. Nobody's picking it up.You like that?It's yours. You want it? It's yours.You look fantastic!I felt like we had a secret. Just the two of us. You know like that thing where you want to just be with the one person the whole time.You feel like the two of you understand something that nobody else gets. I could just tell her everything about myself. And I never had anybody like that in my life before. I felt like finally, I can truly be myself without being ashamed, without being embarrassed.Yeah, sometimes. This is my office.This getting to be my main business, my growing business. I help get loans for guys that can't get loans. I'm their last resort.That's right, smarty pants.I love you, you're so smart. You are.Well --These guys are lousy risks, you know? I can't get them a loan but I get my fee. Five thousand.These are bad guys, you know? They got bad divorces, gambling habits, embezzling, all that shit, you know what I mean?How about `we'?How bout it?Sydney. Sydney I'm sorry that was too much. I went too far. I didn't want to upset you.Sydney please, I'm sorry! I know it ain't for everybody.Ah GOD I love getting to know you!What I do that for? I fucked it up. I should never tell a woman the truth. She's so smart. She's different.Yeah.That was fucking fantastic.I liked it. I didn't think you were coming back. Thank god you came back.I fucking love you.These are the roles that we were meant to play.You got a strong application. We'll talk about it.I don't take a deal that I can't close.I was doing so much more business with her. I mean it doubled, then it tripled.And I never met anyone, man or woman, in business who was so careful and precise about everything. Every stylistic detail.We kept selling art together, too.Paul Klee. Bauhaus Movement. 1920s.Let's just say it's missing from Spain and leave it at that.I mean it just took off. We got an elegant Manhattan office. We called it London Associates for her accent.When I was around her I felt joy. Fucking joy! And love. That's what I felt.As, as far as I could see, people were always conning each other to get what they wanted. We even con ourselves.We talk ourselves into things. We sell ourselves things we maybe don't even need or want by dressing them up. We leave out the risk. We leave out the ugly truth.Pay attention to that because we're all conning ourselves in one way or another just to get through life.Danny. This is a fantastic picture. What did you do today?The big kid? I thought Mommy picked you up so he couldn't bother you.What fire?For the first time in my life I do the right thing.I save a young single mother, and her kid. I marry her. I adopt him -Yes, I fell in love. My God, I fell in love. Yes. But you know what? I thought you were mysterious like my mother until it turned out that mysterious just meant depressed, hard to reach. I mean, I'm dying here! And you need somebody who's gonna be quiet like you. You're young, you're beautiful. You gotta find somebody else. You gotta go out and get some friends all right? Don't sit inside --Yeah but you can't just stay in the house with the fucking sun lamp. Alright? And I can't-- I mean, look, I can't trust you with it anyway. That fire and everything. I can't trust to leave you with Danny.Oh, what, there wouldn't have been a fire if I was here?We're not happy. Alright?Come on. What are we doing here?She was the Piccaso of passive aggressive karate. She was better than any con artist I'd ever met including myself. And she had me like nobody had me.You might say she was my karma for how I took advantage of people.Alright.I did not want to leave the kid behind. He was my son. She had me. I was her mark.-- and every deal I take, I close. However, my fee is non refundable, just like my time.That's correct.Two lunches?That's unusual.Yeah, right. You liked it? Should I take you there?Should I take you there twice?What's going on, you like this guy?Is that messing up your judgement? Don't be stupid.Hey, play your part.If you could excuse me for one second?You got the wrong office, you're gonna be embarrassed.HEY, HEY, HEY! GO EASY ON HER.Fraud?! Fraud? What is that? Identity fraud?Oh really? That's interesting. I don't even know your real name.He wouldn't let me see her for three days. He even managed to delay a lawyer.She couldn't handle it.Who made you god and judge?Congratulations.Why you breaking my balls? Get to the point.Four busts and you'll leave us alone? We don't have to testify?What about Danny?I adopted him! I gave him my name! I'm not leaving him with Rosalyn, she's unstable!I can't leave him. I love him. Alright? He's my son.Richie? What, the cop? Your on a first name basis with him?What list?We do have something. I love you, it's perfect! What are you saying? We're gonna go to Romania? We're gonna take Danny?Well you never said that before.I can't leave Danny. I'll lose custody.What are you doing?! Please!Don't say I don't love you because that's bullshit!Please don't do this.I could never con you. I love you. Please don't say this.Don't say that.We don't need another move. We need four busts, and we're done.How do you think this works, stupid?OK, to set this up and bust a con artist we have to make the honey pot to attract the bees. In order to attract the bees, we need to offer them a wealthy individual who can be taken advantage of, someone special, someone new, someone amazing. Then those guys will want to sell fake bank CDS to THAT guy, take the sheik's money, see?Keep your voice down.Right, but I don't tell Elway shit. I wait for him to call me. The art world is a small world -- and one of Elway's acquaintances is clocking us right now.Don't look.You have a good look?This is my friend Al from Queens.I want to show you something. This Rembrandt here? People come from all over the world to see this.It's a fake.People believe what they want to believe. Cause the guy who made this was so good that it's real to everybody. Now whose the master -- the painter or the forger?That's the way the world works. Not black and white as you say. Extremely grey.How many times I gotta tell you. You can't meet the sheik, alright?It ain't for you Carl.This is not a one man operation.You're telling me that you can get four guys to sell fake certificates of deposit to my investor within a week?That's interesting but you know I've got other guys lined up. I've got a meeting with my associates.I've got to go.Crazy thing about people -- the more you say no, the more they want in on somethin. It is so stupid.I'll tell them, don't worry. Hey you know what Carl just told me? He said he could do this whole thing with four guys within a week.Hey, quit while you're ahead Carl.We succeeded because we stayed small. I got you Carl Elway. He bought stolen art, sold fake bank C.D.'s, that's enough. That's one. I get you three more -- no politicians.Now you keep changing the rules. You're gettin' a little power drunk, Richard.You want to tell him, Edith? You want to wake him up?I mean, he's the one ruining America, not me.Because people just got over Watergate and Vietnam, alright? And you're gonna shit all over politicians again? And just because you want to be a big shot and get a promotion.You will never do it properly because you got too much government attitude to be small and sleek. I'm like the fuckin' Vietcong, man. I'm in and I'm out. I was there the whole time -- you don't know it. That's the fucking art of becoming somebody who people can pin their beliefs and their dreams on. And you can't do it.For Carmine Polito and rebuilding Atlantic City?You need a luxury hotel for the Sheik. Come on!You gotta knock the Mayor, the Speaker of the State Assembly -- you gotta knock him off of his fucking feet. He's gotta feel like he's out of his league. What you're offering, this deal, I mean, this is unheard of in the state of New Jersey, maybe even the whole fucking country. A sheik with hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild Atlantic City -- are you fuckin' kidding me? That's gigantic. And the Mayor, he's going to want to see cash, he's going to want to see it in an account, he's going to want to see it right now, and he will check. And that's why this meeting isn't happening, because to get millions, you need millions.What?`We' meaning you and him?Really?You showed him our thing? You did that without me? Are you kidding me?Mr. Mayor -- Please stop. Listen, I apologize if that prick offended you. I really apologize.No. I'm fucking embarrassed to be associated with that guy at all. Can I just say somethin' to you, please? Don't lose this opportunity to fuckin' Florida -- all right? -- because of some bullshit from that punk advisor with his diploma who could never get into the school that we come from. Don't lose that opportunity.I'm from the Bronx. Grand Concourse, Hundred and Sixty-fourth Street.Yeah, Tomaso's.Yes. They're always good.Carmine -- can I call you Carmine? You know, Carmine -- My fuckin' heart's going from running down the stairs -- I'm not used to running. There's a lotta green grass in that hotel room up there, alright? And all the deals would float through you. You get a serious piece on both ends. You do with that what you will. I live in the real world, I am a family man, I got mouths to feed and everything. But, you know, we just...we gotta grease you directly. No middlemen, no bullshit. It's the Arab way.Hey, listen, I was thrown as well.Done.I gotta work with him. He's the Sheik's man.Done.I'm going out to dinner with Carmine and the wives in Camden.Carmine and myself and the wives.He doesn't like you, what do you want from me, I got him to come back and take the money and you got him on tape alright? I can't make him like you. I did my job.I just fucking told you he doesn't like you. I mean, let him have a night out with a human being for fuck's sake, he's going to jail soon. You're done with him. You got him on tape taking a bribe.What?! Like who?!Are you fuckin' nuts? What are you say--More politicians? You realize how fuckin' dangerous that is? There's no fucking reasoning with you.Edith and I were so successful for so long because we kept it just small enough. You are takin' us to a very fucking dangerous place, with very serious numbers!That's the one thing you heard me say?I get to handle two wives with one dinner, alright? I take Rosalyn out, she keeps her mouth shut, she sees that my work is legitimate, I get to keep my kid, and I get to keep that fucking wife happy. Both wives happy.I believe that you should treat people the way that you want to be treated.Didn't Jesus say that or something?Also, always take a favor over money. I think Jesus said that as well.I can't get enough.I can't stop.Dolly, can me and the mayor talk business here?I'd just hate it if it didn't work out.Sure.He's an Arab.Why you asking?Yeah we can do that. He can see Camden.For me?What is it?Really?And you specifically bought this science oven for me.Thank you.I told you not to put metal in the science oven. Why did you do that for?I don't want another one. I want the one that Carmine gave me.That's bullshit.I don't think you should come to Carmine's party tonight. You look beautiful by the way.What are you doing? Get under the umbrella. It's just that Carmine wants Rosalyn to come.It's good.Paco? He's--wait, he's not a real Arab.Wait, where's my guy? Where's Al from Queens?My friend from Queens. Where is he? What are you doing?What are you-- You speak any Arabic?That's it? That's all you got?From the feet up, you motherfucker. What are you doing? Act normal. That's it. Like you can barely understand English. You can't speak it. You say as little as possible. You follow my lead. Alright?I've got the vision? You know what vision I had? You just kissing my girl outside. That's what vision I had.You got a knife. This is for the Mayor. You've got to present it to him. Look me in the eye. This means a lot to you. Right? That knife.Play it. You present it. \"Friendship for life,\" alright? You gotta feel it. Sacred. Can you do it?You gotta sell it.If you believe it's sacred, it's sacred.Can you do it?Again? You compliment me again. What is this, rubbing salt in the wound?Are you fucking kidding? What do you care? You're Mexican.The Sheik's very particular. It's international cultural protocol.Do not answer that!Give it to me.Look, I told you, for God's sake, I told you not to call here.No way.That's too many people for me to control, no.Rosalyn, get off the extension!Look, don't call here again, alright? Don't call at home.OK.It's bodyguards for the visiting dignitary, that's all.Why you gotta say that? I mean, that's why I can't invite you. It's too complicated. Listen, come on.Look, stop being so nosy.Look at this shit.Can we clean up this fridge? I mean, what are you causing trouble for all the time?DO NOT ANSWER THAT--Gimme the phone, come on.Hey, Carmie.Look, you know what she's like. She's unpredictable. She's just always --I can't hear what he's saying.No, it's just Rosalyn's unpredictable.Alright, you happy? Go get ready.Right.You mean the Mob?Carmine, maybe -- I'm not sure that's such a good idea. We gotta confer before we talk to these guys.Rosalyn!No, she's my wife. She's my wife.It's a sign of disrespect to do business on the first meeting.Victor Tellegio was from Miami. He was Meyer Lansky's right-hand man. In his prior reputation as an enforcer from twenty years ago, he was known to never bury a body because he felt it sent a stronger message to leave it in the street.This is the guy we now had to deal with.What are we talking about?I say stay away from that. That's bad. That's trouble. No, that's not good.That's trouble.Nothing. No problem.What are the odds of an Italian guy from Miami knowing Arabic? But it turns out he's got casino investments in the Mideast and he spent two years learning it to keep the upper hand.Will you please step away from Edith. I'm asking you nicely please step away from Edith right now.Step away from her. Please.What Richie's gotten us into is worse then jail. I told you last night, don't sit down with those goons. And what? Now what? No one's getting ten million for Tellegio. It's over.You were right. We should have gone away.I should have gone away with you.I wish I could get you back.You know I can't do it without you. You know that. Come on. Me, you and Danny. Like we said.That's big. That's crazy. Whatever it is, it's got to be the best we've ever done.You got the whole floor?Yeah, I'm good --That's right. That's the idea.Hotels. Restaurants. It's waiting to happen. Carmine sees it, this fucking thing is waiting to happen.I just gotta go see a man about a dog.I want to save us. I want to save Carmine. It's fucking killing me.It's dangerous. We gotta get a wire in there. We gotta make him feel safe.Yep.ROSALYN! ROSALYN!This is a real low in our relationship! You know where I was recently? I was in your boyfriend's fucking car! I saw your nail polish.That's bullshit!That's bullshit.HE PUT A CANVAS BAG OVER MY HEAD!ARE YOU HAPPY NOW? BECAUSE HE IS TRYING TO KILL ME!WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?WHY ARE YOU TALKING SO MUCH? YOU'RE GOING TO GET US ALL KILLED!Danny. Come here buddy alright? Go draw a picture or something.I'M A SICK SON OF A BITCH? YOU'RE TRYING TO GET ME FUCKING KILLED. OH MY GOD!! YOU DRIVE ME SO FUCKING CRAZY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! YOU'RE BOYFRIEND -- YOUR FUCKING BOYFRIEND WILL KILL ME, HE'LL KILL DANNY, AND HE'LL KILL YOU.He's a mobster alright? That's who you're dealing with.You're NOT going to Miami.You are NOT going to Miami.Too dangerous. Miami? Not now. Too dangerous.Not now. Everything has to stay normal right now. And you're going to shut your mouth!Oh and what a DOOZY you picked!He's the most dangerous guy ever.I've got a plan.I've got a plan.It really fucking came to me when I was inside of that canvas bag with your boyfriend's hands around my throat. That's when it really came to me.We've got two million coming this week!You ask Victor if he wants two million this week. That's real money. Two million.Wired in.It's not fucking true. That's not true.I can save all of us, and we can save money. I can take care of you and Danny. OK? But you gotta close your mouth.OK. Thank you, Rosalyn. Thank you for the plan.I appreciate that. So, I think that we should be partners on this.So what is our plan? Tell me the plan. What are you gonna do?You gotta stop talking about your government agencies and your I.R.S. and your tax and your conspiracies and all of that. You're gonna say how you were wrong, you were wrong about that.OK.OK. You were right.You're so smart. Good job, peaches.OK.Alright.Necessity truly is the mother of invention. The F.B.I. was willing to wire the two million dollars if it meant taking down Tellegio and his entire organization.A mobster like Tellegio would never meet at the Plaza Hotel, but only at the office of his attorney, Alfonse Simone.Irving Rosenfeld.We can't, we can't make that decision. It's not the right thing. It's not the right time. It's just not good.I'm not being hasty. It's just, let's be smart about it. This is not how we do business. I'm sorry. I apologize.He isn't.This is a surprise. The Sheik doesn't like surprises.Edith, this is not your decision to make.That's not the plan. That's not the --I gotta do it.I want to face you like a man because I want to be real now.It's the Feds.Yeah.You are!Hey look, you're a good person I know that but in all honesty --They fuckin' made me do it. What was I supposed to do? They had Syd in jail.I want to make this right. I came here because I want to make it right.I never had a friend like you before.I got some leverage, alright? I can help you out.Carmine, Syd and I got a plan for you. We can help you out.I don't want to -- I'm sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen.Truly, I didn't mean for this to happen.I just want to make it right.I'm sorry Carmine, I'm sorry.I've got to lay down.Yes.I love you.Two million? It's with Victor Tellegio and Alfonse Simone.Where's it gone?That's interesting. That's very interesting. I have no idea.No idea what you're talking about.I don't think so.Richard, think about it, YOU requested the two million. And you gave Brenda the account number. We didn't do any of that. None of it. How do we know that YOU don't have the money?I find this a little offensive. Really, I find this a little offensive and I don't see that you got any sort of solid case against--Richard, think about it. You got some big arrests. You got U.S. Congressmen. You look good. You're gonna be all over the news. You know what doesn't look good? A story about gross incompetenceThe role of Tellegio's attorney, Alfonse Simone, was played by our friend Ed Malone --the \"Cold Cut King of Long Island\"--Whose party we were at when Sydney and I first met.Well that doesn't sound so good, either. I mean -- and I don't know what you're talking about, but -- let's just assume you want to go with that story. Really? That's the story you want to go with? That's what you want the New York Times to hear? That you got conned by the very con men who you forced to entrap the members of Congress in the first place. That's what you want to go with? That doesn't sound so good for your whole thing.And how ironic that the most creative minds, the ones who are working hardest to get the economy of New Jersey going, those are the ones that you round up. And why? Because what, they're the easiest to go after? And what about the real bullshit artists? You didn't even come close to the big leagues. Those big guys. The money men.I'm sorry to tell you, you got none of 'em.We took down some very big guys.Some of whom were just doing business as usual helping their communities or their states.But some of them knew they had larceny in their blood--And they even admitted it.But in all it was six Congressmen, one United States Senator, and my friend, Carmine Polito.We gave the two million back so Carmine got the reduced sentence. 18 months. The loss of his friendship would haunt me for the rest of my life.And when the story was written, Richard Dimaso's name was never mentioned.Syd and I moved in together. And Rosalyn --She would always be interesting.Yes I did. He never took a nickle so they can't get him for nothing. I was never going to let that happen.Our conning days were behind us.You can fool yourself for just so long and then your next reinvention better have your damn feet on the ground.We got a loan from a bank and were able to go gallery legitimate.The art of survival is a story that never ends.", "clean_line": "shittiest suite plaza hotel dressing like dressing asked wanna fuck guest fucking touch

I do business face to face, person to person. That's just who I am.What are you doing? What-- Carl, what the fuck? What is this?What is this?I don't know what the fuck that is but it's weird you understand?I came here to meet a sheik, that's all I know. I'm very interested in that but he's not here apparently. Carl?!I'm very interested in meeting the Sheik. You let me know when THAT could happen! Thank you, have a good day.The W.P.A. employed craftsmen to paint this during the Depression. Why can't we employ people today to do work like this in rebuilding Atlantic City?Really, I'm all right, thank you. I'm okay.Where you from?I got a lot of friends that live up there. I go to Tomaso's on Arthur Avenue. You know Tomasos's?The spicy clams.Oh, they're to fucking die for, those clams. I haven't been there in a while. I like that place.Yeah, look, I understand. It's a great opportunity. It's just I got a little thrown by going to have a meeting with somebody who ended up not being there, so --I understand. I'll deal with you directly. I don't want any middleman or any of that bullshit.I like you. Eye to eye. We can do business together.How long do you know this guy? You work with this guy before?But I still need to meet the Sheik, okay?Rocco, you know like we do. The chicken very thin. You should see the way he does this chicken with the red sauceRight? With the red sauce, the lemon--Right.He may have.I don't know if he said the second one but he may have said the first one.Smells like flowers.You know what that is for me? It's coriander for me.This guy right here, Irving Rosenfeld? You know what he's gonna do? He's gonna bring the Sheik to Atlantic City, where we can rebuild all those resorts there, put everybody back to work.He's gonna get this community -- he's gonna get this state -- back on its feet where it belongs. Isn't that right?He's gonna grow our tax base and create thousands and thousands of jobs for everyone. You understand that? You know what that means?This guy right here. He's got a big heart.What do you mean? Of course it's going to work out. Guys like you and me? We dream and we build. We never give up.

To see the people of Camden. The people I serve. The people I love. Who are mostly black and Puerto Rican. I really want him to see how good this is going to be for the community, how ready we are for this opportunity, and he can see how far his dollar will go. You know what I mean?
