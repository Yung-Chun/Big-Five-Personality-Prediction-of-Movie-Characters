{"Battle-Los-Angeles": {"SGT. NANTZ": {"raw_line": "No mistake, John.They can take the Good Conduct Medal and shove it up their...I appreciate it, John. You know that. But, I been to too many funerals. Had to visit too many moms and dads, tell 'em about what happened to their sons...I did my twenty. I'm done. Roy takes this in, nods. He stands, holds his hand out.Wanna bet?Goddamn it, Imlay, you gonna wipe his ass for him, too? Every man carries his weight! Nantz drops back, runs alongside the struggling Lenihan.Just quit, Lenihan. Do us all a favor. 'Cause the squad's only as strong as the weakest man.,.. Lenihan STUMBLES and FALLS IN THE DIRT.And right now you're getting us all killed. You hear? On these words, NANTZ MEETS EYES WITH CORREGGIO, further back in the pack. Nantz looks away, sees... Imlay, suddenly at Lenihan's side, helping him up. Nantz shoves Imlay away, knocking him onto his ass.You think you're helping him, Imlay!? You think you're making him stronger?! Nantz puts a boot into Imlay's chest, shoving him flat. Correggio stares at this, steaming.Stay on the goddamn ground, Imlay! You've just been gut-shot.Come on, goddamnit! It's a hot LZ! The chopper's gotta move! They're gonna leave you BOTH to die!!! Lenihan staggers, knees trembling, weaving back and forth. Then his foot comes down on a ROCK IN THE TRAIL. His ANKLE GIVES WAY. Lenihan falls, yells in pain, grabbing his ankle.Don't you ever tell me you can't! Correggio takes a step towards Nantz now. Kerns stops him.He's not injured. He twisted his goddamn ankle. Nantz' looks over the men, sweaty, covered with grime.We are marines. \"Can't\" is not the code we live by. \"Can't\" gets marines killed. Do things the right way, the marine way, maybe you get to come home... Maybe your buddy gets to come home. Correggio stares back sullenly on this.Dying's easy, ladies. Everything else takes balls. Nantz spits on the ground.Adukwu. Run a bag of saline into Lenihan and tape that ankle. We start back in ten minutes.Hold. The squad stops, following Nantz' gaze to... An approaching dust cloud, being kicked up by... A HUMVEE and TWO FIVE-TON TRUCKS Speeding up the dirt road toward the marines. Everyone is silent as they watch the HUMVEE and TRUCKS pull up... This is not normal. 1st Sergeant Roy hops from the Humvee, shouting:What's going on, John?For what? Do I have a choice here? They arrive at the Humvee. Roy turns to Nantz.Just don't lose my paperwork.What d'you mean? He turns., stares at Nantz.What are the odds? As the Humvee pulls to the COMMAND BUILDING, Nantz sees... LT. MARTINEZ hurrying to meet them.They calling us.in because of these meteors, Lieutenant?No problem, sir. It's all yours.You got something to get off your chest, Corporal?Get aboard, Corporal. Correggio jumps into the chopper.We'll know soon enough, private.What do we know about these things, Captain?Kill anything that's not human.Something bad, private. Now get back with your team.Marines! Hold your position! Kerns stops, spinning, looking. for targets, breath ragged, eyes panicked. Correggio races up.One enemy runs and you break discipline and chase it?! Think, marines. Stay alive.Quiet. Nantz, unnerved himself, stares into the smoke...That thing running down the street... That was to draw us in... Slowly, fading in, we hear what Nantz hears now... A RUMBLING SOUND BEHIND THEM. Building. Nantz spins to it.They're coming. We took the bait, now they're cutting us off.Light it up! The squad lets loose with a barrage of FIRE as...We can hold this position, Lieutenant!Sir, these things seem to be operating tactically! Don't let them dictate your decisions...It's an ambush. This is the kill zone! Nantz slings his COMBAT SHOTGUN forward.Stow that shit, Private. Watch the yard. Secure the back. We're not dyin' here today. The marines take up firing positions at windows and doors.Sir, what are your orders? Martinez turns, stares at Nantz.Sir. Your orders. Beat. Martinez nods.Radio the FOB. Get us a medevac at that park by the community center. As Mottola works the radio, he's startled to see Guerrero, who has been SLASHED across both eyes.I'll go for Lenihan, sir.What I need is for you to keep quiet. And stay close.Starting now, Private. As Nantz turns, Mottola slaps Imlay in the helmet.Lenihan. This is Sgt. Nantz...Is the house a two-story? Lenihan stares, his eyes going wide, panicked.Lenihan, is the house a...? Lenihan CLICKS the radio OFF. Then waits, very still, listening, M-16 held tightly. His breathing turns shallow-- from loss of blood and from fear. Lenihan sees the BRANCHES of a bush SWAYING outside the window, as if something just brushed past it.Lenihan...? Lenihan...? Imlay taps Nantz on the shoulder, motions to his ears. He hears something... The marines freeze, Nantz clicking the radio off as... Nearby, they hear SOUNDS of aliens running... Somewhere...We're gonna get you to the medevac, Private.But Lenihan...Ever get separated from your unit again, I'll find you and shoot you myself.U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines! A clattering. The marines immediately move toward it, peering down the dark hall...How many of you? A MAN, JOE RINCON, 45, jacket and tie, behind her.Where? Where are the kids? He pushes past the adults, sees TWO GIRLS AND A BOY, 8-10.Wait! Stavrou, hold it! KIDS! Stavrou tries to hold the chopper, screaming at it as...That is not relevant, Imlay! They're here. They're trying to kill us. Kill them first! Martinez eyes Nantz on this. Then barks orders:You heard the lieutenant. Move! The dazed marines begin COVERING doors and hallways. We see in their FACES that it's a very different fight now. Nantz turns, can see the MEDEVAC ABLAZE out a window. His solemn stare hints at a growing desperation. Martinez steps up to him, looks out. Quietly:How's that gonna help them survive, Lieutenant?What happened to everyone?Adukwu, bring your kit. Adukwu is immediately up, moving to Nantz.We're gonna cut one of these things open. See if we can figure out what makes 'em tick. Michele overhears, offering:You're a veteran?Oh... Okay. Well, thanks, um... Nantz has forgotten her name. She smiles.Right. Michele. ) Sorry. Mottola walks up.You sure you can do this?What's the plan, Lieutenant?Maybe we should stay on foot. Martinez looks at Nantz. Then opens a MAP, pointing to 'Santa Monica Airport' on it.We have no radio contact, nothing to let us know the best route to take... And a bus is a big target.Harris, Stavrou, lieutenant needs recon on a.bus. It was abandoned two blocks south off 11th...Can you hotwire a bus?Talk about commitment to cause. Adukwu examines a VENTED CAP just to the right of where the alien's 'heart' would be. Thick, fleshy veins run from it.Thank you, private. Adukwu twists the cap. It comes free, revealing... A GELATINOUS ORGAN. Slimy, viscous fluid seeping from it.. Everyone steps back, reacting to the putrid smell.Whatever you do, do it quietly, Imlay.Not so hard to kill when you know where to aim. Mottola appears in the room, a sense of controlled panic.Lieutenant. Maybe we should gather the civilians in the gym.We're out of time! Martinez looks INTO THE GYM, sees the kids staring back.We've got forty minutes 'til they level this area.The call's been made, private. You so eager to decide the fate of all these people? Imlay is stone silent.Didn't think so. Then Nantz looks up, meeting eyes with Martinez as... A NOISE in the distance now. A low VIBRATION, building. Nantz moves to Martinez. They peer out of the front. LIGHTS fill the sky, heading east. As they approach... The VIBRATION gets louder and louder, shaking the bus now.Everybody get down, weapons inside the bus. Make no noise. The men pull their guns in from the windows, crouching as low as possible, straining to see, hear... The vibrations grow louder, LOUDER! Suddenly... WHOOSH! An ALIEN AIRCRAFT rips overhead. Then another, and another, and another... All heading east. The image of their speed, their power, their other- worldliness is overwhelming, devastating. Nantz stares, relief flooding his face, as the armada flies on. Leaving them behind. Until... Suddenly, Mottola's RADIO BLARES!(staring at the radio,They're tracking our signals! All radios, cell phones-- keep everything off! Everyone stares silently, tensely. Then... A single BEAM OF LIGHT suddenly shines from the alien craft. Then the alien aircraft MOVES FORWARD again. Slowly. But still heading their way.Hi. Could I have your, uh, hair thing? She stares, wide-eyed, at this fearsome, sweating marine.Anything happens, Lieutenant, get the SAWS up front and take off with these kids.We're clear, Lieutenant. Nearby, Imlay whispers to Mottola:Sir. We get on that freeway, we'll be exposed...That's a pretty safe bet.Hostiles. Back up. Now, go! Stavrou guns the BUS BACKWARDS, knocking abandoned cars out of the way...Let's dismount, set up a perimeter, get the civilians down to the street.And don't forget, aim chest, right! Imlay joins Harris, SMASHING THE SKYLIGHT out of the bus roof, CLIMBING OUT, taking position on the bus' roof. The rest of the marines EXIT THE BUS. Nantz grabs Adukwu.Stay here with the civilians. As soon as Stavrou gives the sign, get them down to the street! Adukwu nods. Nantz starts off the bus.Course not, kid, we're the good guys. And Nantz is off the bus.Prepare to repel. Fix bayonets! This might get up-close and personal! Just a low CLATTERING now, the battle-rattle of Nantz and his men fixing BAYONETS to their rifles. Nantz-yells out:Cpl. Harris!Being vastly outnumbered provides a marine rifleman with what?Marines. We stand here. Let these bastards know who they're fucking with.It's set to fire in three round bursts. We're low, so don't waste your shots. Rincon holds the M-16 against his shoulder, aiming.And give 'em hell. Rincon sights down the barrel of his rifle at ONE ALIEN in the distance. He squeezes the trigger...Gimme two of your smoke cannisters! Martinez pops two canisters off, hands them to Nantz.Kerns! Come on!I'm not worried about fightin' next to you, Kerns. Now let's go. A slight smile from Kerns on this as he follows Nantz... Who sprints low, scurrying between cars... 10... 20... 30 yards closer to the enemy. Nantz and Kerns arrive at a large SUV. Kerns ducks low, covering Nantz. Nantz crouches, opens the gas tank... Unscrews the fuse from the smoke grenade body, tossing the canister aside... pulls the pin... flips the 'spoon' off...Get ready to move on my word. Nantz holds the fuse over the open gas cap.Now! Nantz drops the fuse into the gas tank. They go RUNNING BACK TOWARD THE BUS as... B0000M! The SUV EXPLODES in a ball of flames! Nantz and Kerns dive BEHIND ANOTHER VEHICLE, Kerns crouching, laying cover fire. Nantz pulls a fuse.Again! Ready?!Lieutenant. We gotta get you outta here. No way we're leavin' you...I'm not leaving you here to die.We're pulling back. Head to the lower street, now! NOW! Nantz runs toward the edge of the destroyed off-ramp, laying cover as the men head down. Harris and Imlay slide down off the roof of the bus, joining the others running to the off-ramp. Correggio sees... MARTINEZ STAYING BEHIND, shooting at the aliens, drawing their fire.Keep movin', corporal! Go! All the men climb DOWN THE OFF-RAMP. Nantz turns to go back to get the Lieutenant himself, sees... Martinez hauling himself toward the rear of the bus.Package Mr. Rincon for transport. We've got to move...Lt. Martinez stayed behind. He knew he was dying...He sacrificed himself to save our asses. Now you get your head straight, Corporal. This is my unit now. Nantz looks at the men, who stare back, shaken.Let's move. We need shelter... Those bombs are gonna drop!Tighten this place down. See if we can establish communications. Hard line only! Nothing wireless.Listen, we're out of the bomb zone... But when they fall, we will definitely be rocked. Make sure the kids are prepared for that. Hector suddenly breaks free, rushing forward.as Imlay and Adukwu enter with Rincon, setting him down. Nantz pulls blankets from a nearby rack, covering Rincon. As he does, we see a glimpse of Rincon's BLOOD-SOAKED CLOTHING. He is very pale. Blood flecks his lips. Hector stares into his father's face, eyes filling. Rincon touches Hector's face lightly.It'll be okay. We'll get your dad fixed up. But when Hector looks to Nantz on this, he can't meet the boy's gaze. Hector can see this isn't the truth.Mr. Rincon, we can take you and... Rincon turns to Nantz, steel-eyed.I can't leave you...You can't look back. You make the best decision you can... A beat.I promise. Rincon holds out his hand. Nantz takes it, meeting his gaze.I don't know.Jesus... Nantz takes a deep breath, his mind racing, the world closing in on him. He turns to Michele.Listen, our Forward Operating Base is about a mile away. We have to go on foot. I'll need your help with Hector now. Michele nods. Watches as Nantz slowly walks to Hector. Nantz kneels by the boy.I'm sorry Hector. Your dad... didn't make it. You understand? Hector, sobbing, overwhelmed by grief and fear, looks up at Nantz.Me too, Hector. I wish it could go back, too...Stavrou, Harris.Blow something up.Check it out. The two marines run down the alley to the SIDE STREET. Nantz sets Hector down. Looks the boy in the face.This is the hardest thing you'll ever have to do... Michele, arms around Kirsten and Amy, watches Nantz.But we'll get through it together. I promise, Hector. Hector nods, still crying. Nantz exchanges a glance with Michele, who moves to Hector, comforting him. Nantz steps away as Kerns and Correggio run up, reporting:We are not losing one more of these civilians. Period. Am I making myself clear?Under the cars! Now! The marines frantically shed their packs, squirming UNDER THE CARS with the civilians, pulling the kids under as...One block over. Imlay smiles at Kerns.The smell. An ominous beat. The squad moves down the dark street as... ASH FLOATS DOWN here from the sky... Like a beautiful early winter snow...Let's get under cover. Now.Lock this place down. The marines fan out, securing doors, checking windows as... Nantz kneels by Hector, tries to comfort him.You're a brave kid. When this is over, you're going to be a hero.Your dad was a hero. Hector just stares back.He saved Pvt. Adukwu up on that freeway. Hector exchanges a glance with Adukwu. Something passes between them... One man died so another could live...You save a marine under fire, you get a medal, y'know. Nantz pulls out a MEDALLION, the CREST of the 2/5 on it.This is our medallion. It's yours. For your dad.During World War I, an officer from our regiment was ordered to retreat. He said, \"Retreat? Hell, we just got here!\" Nantz is happy to see a slow smile from Hector now. Harris calls out:Listen up. We need ammo. Kerns, Adukwu stay with the civilians. The rest of us, let's move. Nantz puts a hand on Hector's shoulder.I'll be right back.Good. Get it running.A minivan's a target, Correggio. A LAV with a Bushmaster chaingun... That's an asset. Imlay grins. Nantz motions to him, starting off.Come on.High ground. We need to see the big picture.Look how far east they've gotten. That's almost the whole city... Nantz looks out through BINOCULARS: Sees the HOLLYWOOD SIGN ablaze in the hills... Then pans to a mid-city area. Stops when he sees one quadrant of the city, blocks wide, SHIMMERING an INKY BLACK. Some kind of DARK ENERGY WAVE emanating from the ground.What the hell's that? Imlay peers out.There's zero activity there. And the area does seem completely devoid of activity-- No alien or human aircraft above it. Like a DEAD ZONE.That must be the alternate extraction site. Maybe we can evacuate the civilians there... He turns to Imlay.Get them in the LAV. I'll radio for an evac helicopter... When I do, they'll be coming, so we have to move fast.We're gonna give it one helluva try, Imlay. He reassures the young marine with each-word:We're not dying here.Use the thermal sight. No lights. Stavrou drives, spins away as Nantz climbs...Extract site's only a couple more miles, Imlay. Imlay nods back. Nantz peers down to...We gotta go around. The LAV backs up, Nantz scanning the sky, gripping the M-240 machine gun, trying to see out into the darkness... Then they TURN A CORNER... And a VIEW BETWEEN TWO TALL BUILDINGS is harrowing... FOUR ALIEN DRONE AIRCRAFT hovering... Then turning. Flying toward them.Get ready, Imlay. Here they come. Stavrou looks out to see... A HELICOPTER in the distance.See what that Bushmaster can do, Imlay! Imlay OPENS UP on the 25MM BUSHMASTER CHAIN GUN.Imlay, on your six! Imlay spins in the turret, picking up... The three remaining ALIEN AIRCRAFT coming back around. The lead alien ship FIRES! A ,CAR EXPLODES next to the LAV. Imlay rocks in the turret.Getting close, Imlay...Stand on it, Stavrou! Stavrou pushes it, TRYING TO OUTRUN the burning wreckage... Which is almost on top of the LAV as... Stavrou spins AROUND A CORNER, escaping. The wreckage explodes into a building behind them as... THUMP - THUMP - THUMP! The sound of a UH-1'Medevac ECHOES.Everybody out! The marines rush the civilians OUT OF THE LAV... Nantz and Imlay scrambling out last.Pretty decent shooting, Imlay.What are you talking about?!What the hell happened?!Set us back down!We need to recon that area!Then we'll rope down!There's something over there... We could be the only ones left here to figure out what it is. Let's go, marines. The marines look frightened, confused. They start to pull themselves up. ROPES are dropped from the chopper as it hovers over the building...NOW! Go! Go! The marines start to RAPPEL DOWN, one after another as... Nantz exchanges a glance with Michele.They'll get you safe. He smiles at the girls. Then turns, nods at Hector. Puts a hand on his shoulder. A BEAT.See you soon, buddy.We're gonna fight. Nantz turns, grabs a ROPE, drops out of the chopper.'Cause we have a job to do.That's right. This fight's not over.Believe me, Correggio, I grieved for every marine I ever lost... Nantz looks around now, from marine to marine.But we are in the fight of our lives right now. And our duty is to keep moving forward. Keep fighting. That's how we honor men like your brother, Correggio. And Lt. Martinez. And Hector's father, who saved Adukwu's life. He wasn't trained for that. He just picked up a rifle and did what needed to be done. If a civilian can do that...I need you men. And maybe we'll die fighting today. Not because we're heroes. But because we're goddamn United States marines, and always will be.Good. 'Cause that's where we're going.Might have to get some cruise missiles in here.Just hit the gas, Corporal. We got plenty of armor. Everyone looks up at this. Then looks out to see... The aliens attacking, FIRING on the LAV as... Stavrou floors it, ALIEN FIRE pinging off the LAV's armor as... SPLAT!!!Reverse, Corporal.What's going on?Stavrou?All right, dismount. Grab anything you think we can use. The men nod, and move OUT OF THE LAV to...Something's generating heat. Messing with our electronics. Sucking up all the power... Nantz scans the street. The sweat dripping into his eyes.Where would you put a critical asset if you wanted to protect it? Or hide it?Harris, Adukwu, stay here, watch the street. Harris and Adukwu nod. Taking position at the entrance. Nantz motions to the others.Let's go. Nantz leads Stavrou, Correggio, Kerns and Imlay down the stopped escalator to the SUBWAY PLATFORM. Nantz stands, gazing around at the empty subway platform. Silent. Spooky. A train is stopped. Doors open. It is dark, the only light bleeding in from the street above. He motions Stavrou to guard against anything coming from above. Then he moves forward with the others. A huge number of BIRDS line the dark cavity above the train tracks, taking cover themselves, roosting quietly. Nantz sees a DOOR in the tunnel wall, heads to it. He pulls his KA-BAR KNIFE out, sticks the blade into the door jam, pops the DOOR OPEN. Nantz turns to Correggio and Kerns.Run, Imlay! Run! BANG. The iron GRATE FLIES into the air.How many?I think I got their attention. Nantz kneels. He opens his pack, pulls out the radio and the case marked GLTD.Look. There's something big down in the tunnels. It's sucking up a lot of power, could be a major Command &.Control asset.We need to destroy it.Hopefully, they can still fire cruise missiles from Pendleton or Vandenburg... I'll radio in a strike, paint the target from the street. You know what that means. The man nod solemnly.Let's do it. He takes a deep breath, raises the radio, and TRANSMITS:Affirmative. They're building a huge complex underground... I think it's the head of the snake. Repeat. I will be...Hold them back! We have to keep the laser on target! Nantz FIRES. An alien goes down. He picks another target and FIRES. The alien staggers, keeps coming. Three more rounds and the alien goes down. But the rest KEEP COMING... closing in...I don't know! Then... An ear-splitting NOISE. The marines look up, see...INCOMING! Fall back! This way! Nantz and his men begin BACKING AWAY. Firing as they do, trying to hold off the aliens. Nantz, limping on his injured ankle, GOES DOWN. Correggio is there to help him up.Don't stop!! We're too close to the impact point!! The marines start running as...Your brother was one helluva marine, Correggio.This has been a hell of a battle. Plenty of other battles to go. Everybody good with that?

Then race down a small hill onto the golf course.Relax, dude. He throws an arm around Kerns' shoulder, smiles at the girls.My buddy's jumpy 'cause he got an assfull a' shrapnel our last tour.We can handle it, baby. We're experts at night maneuvers. Nearby, the SECOND GIRL chats up Adukwu.MPs! The marines grab the goggles and clubs, pile...Good. Wish he done it years ago. Lenihan, struggling, breathing hard, looks up at this, STUMBLING as he does. Nantz, looking back at the chatter, sees... Imlay grab hold of Lenihan, helping him forward now.He's injured, Sergeant.That what you heard? You don't know shit, Lenihan. Correggio, pissed, grabs his pack, heads for the door.Move your asses. They want us in the armory. And he's gone. Lenihan, confused, looks at Imlay.No. It's cool, Sergeant. You got a Silver Star and my brother came home in a box. I get it. Beat.Relax, man. Kerns just shoots him a look. The squad moves on. As they approach a SIDE STREET that intersects 10th... The DOG WHINES. Correggio pets it, trying to comfort it...What'd you see?! Suddenly, the INDISTINCT FORM of an ALIEN CREATURE appears through the smoke, moving FAST down the side street. Kerns is ready, FIRING. The others react, FIRING as well. The ALIEN FORM is blasted, DROPPING into the smoke.You okay?What are we shooting at?!You okay? Kerns stares back, deer in the headlights. He nods. ADUKWU IS WRAPPING GRAYSTON'S ARM as Grayston fumbles for a CIGARETTE. Adukwu lights it for him..fucking aliens. Kerns looks at Correggio, starts to chuckle at the absurdity of it all. Then Correggio laughs. It's infectious. It's desperate. Then the laughter slows. Stops.You are handling it. Thing I'm worried about is Nantz.Yeah? Tell my brother that.Stavrou, Harris....you're clear down 11th Street. They exchange a quick glance.Harris, hostiles advancing right at you. Approximately two hundred meters and closing...Come on!! Come on!! Get some! Rincon and Michele, breathing ragged, feet pounding, look up... They're getting closer and closer to the off-ramp as... Alien rounds blow chunks of concrete off the roadway... UP AHEAD, Kerns and Adukwu rush the girls to the EDGE OF THE RAMP, hurrying to get them down as... Rincon and Michele REACH THE OFF-RAMP now. Kerns grabs Hector, HELPING HIM ANGLE DOWN THE OFF-RAMP, getting the boy safely handed down to awaiting Stavrou as...Sergeant. Did you just leave Lt. Martinez back there?So you left him? Is that how it is with you?Some goddamn tanks. Beat. Everyone stares as... The CLOCK ticks to NINE...That much ordinance? They'd feel it in Nevada. Something's wrong...Looks good, both directions. Out of earshot of the civilians, Nantz spins to his men with fiery intensity.This was a dug-in marine Corps position that had armor, air and ground. Maybe we got nothing left to fight with... Michele MEETS EYES WITH NANTZ. His look tells us everything--Seems like vehicles are targets...What the hell, sergeant? What's going on?You have some hunch and now we're stuck out here in the shit?!Sergeant's gonna get us killed! Just like my brother. A beat. Nantz eyes Correggio. It's laid open now.No lights.Hell, dying's easy, ladies. Everything else takes balls, right? They all laugh softly.Think you just twisted your ankle,. sir.

I'm looking after him since he don't know his ass from a hot rock. Lenihan suddenly ducks behind the Tahoe, throwing up.Yeah. We always take the new meat out here to christen 'em... Lenihan shuffles back out from behind the Tahoe.Hey, barfy. Grab your beer. toast. Everyone holds beers aloft. Lenihan joins in reluctantly.To Lenihan. Who gets his first taste a' those hills tomorrow. He points off to the HILLY, DESOLATE TERRAIN near the course.They shifted Nantz into our unit. Something must be going on.Nantz lost a lotta guys on that tour. Correggio's brother was one of 'em. Lenihan nods, somber, getting it.You mean, like, from space?!What the hell...?Ugly as ever, bro. The squad hunkers down, trying to find any cover-available-- behind cars, trees. Martinez drops BEHIND A CAR, pulls out his MAP, checking it for escape routes.-Yeah, and there's a million of 'em!Hey, where the hell is Lenihan?! Everyone stops, stares.We got your six, Sergeant. Anything you need.Right. Got it. Quiet.They're butt ugly, that's what they are. Nantz grabs onto Lenihan, noticing his wound.We got four!Why'd those bastards have to come down here and start this shit?!No way, sweetheart. The woman, Michele McDermott, is clearly rattled, struggling for composure, eyes constantly moving to the kids. Mr. Rincon, a calm, watchful air about him, stands with his son, HECTOR, the kid who Nantz had carried to the chopper.He's from Nigeria, Lieutenant. Not a different solar system. Nantz looks over at Imlay.Whoa, that stinks! Everyone steps back except Michele, that is. Unfazed, she takes her scalpel, makes an INCISION across the organ.I'm gonna puke. Swear to God, I'm gonna puke!Why the hell'd the lieutenant wanna take a bus? We're sittin' ducks.Who's John Wayne? Martinez looks up from the map, turns to Stavrou.I got about three dozen hostiles, twelve o'clock. 300 meters now. Coming fast.Damn, Sergeant sure as shit's ninja. He just gave us a kill zone, didn't he, Corporal?Four minutes and those bombs drop, Sergeant. NANTZ looks over at this. But his expression is blank. He turns back to Rincon, who's staring straight into him.Thirty seconds!Those bombs drop, then everything's gonna change. Get to the FOB, get some goddamn ammo...Maybe it's good... Maybe we turned the tide...How far, sergeant?We'.re gonna make it! Dude, we're gonna make it... But as they approach a CORNER... Nantz stops, exchanges a glance with his corporals.Jesus... They wiped our Forward Operating Base right off the map.Sorry, bro. He moves on to another fallen marine, searching.Sorry, bro. Across the runway, Nantz pulls ammo from the pouch of a dead marine. Then looking up, he sees...Good job, Sergeant!What are we gonna do, Sergeant? Nantz, panning with the binoculars, sees a CHOPPER TAKING OFF in the distance now. Nantz grabs a MAP on the desk, eyes roaming over it. Then looks back to where he saw the chopper.Think we can make it, Sergeant?Come on, you martian bastards! The Bushmaster is a rapid-firing CANNON spewing 200 rounds a minute, each capable of destroying a light tank. For once, the aliens are overmatched. The ALIEN SHIPS take HEAVY FIRE from the Bushmaster... One goes down IN FLAMES, the others PEEL OFF, flying behind buildings.Where'd they go? Where'd they go? Nantz is scanning the sky, then...Son of a... Imlay targets, fires the Bushmaster... The lead alien ship is HIT, winging out of control INTO A SECOND SHIP. The TWO SHIPS EXPLODE into a building as... The FINAL ALIEN AIRCRAFT dodges the FIREBALL, flying straight at the LAV...I got it. Imlay FIRES a burst. The last aircraft is hit...The chopper! Nantz looks out, sees the CHOPPER LANDING in the street. The LAV screeches up amid the RUBBLE and SMOKE.But we were getting out...!Laser target, sir?Shit, yes, Sergeant.Hot as hell here.We gotta hold 'em off long enough to paint the target.Here they come!

MARTINEZ": {"raw_line": "What are you doing up so early? She holds up the object in her hands-- It's Martinez'Yeah, lot of things we gotta get used to. We see her VERY PREGNANT BELLY now as she smiles back, exits. As she does, Martinez turns back to the TELEVISION: 'METEORS' falling into a distant ocean.I assume so... Maybe an evacuation. Whatever it is, it'll be good to get out in the field with the men. Nantz looks askance at this. Martinez catches it.Look, Sergeant, let's be clear. I know your rep, know what you've done... But this is my unit. We're not gonna have a problem, are we?So... what are they, Captain?As you probably heard, Sgt. Nantz will be taking over for Sgt. Beck. We're lucky to have him aboard. The CH-46 helicopters TOUCHES DOWN now, its massive,, bay door opening for them. Martinez barks:Let's move, men!, The platoon grabs gear, runs for the helicopter, climbing aboard. Nantz hurries them along, grabbing packs, throwing them on after the marines. Then he grabs Correggio's pack, about to throw the pack on... Correggio grabs it back from Nantz. Nantz turns, faces off with Correggio.Santa Monica airport's our Forward Operating Base. We get some Cobras and F-18s in the air, we'll have plenty of support. Nantz nods. They're flying into the unknown and Martinez seems as nervous as the younger men. Kerns leans in to Nantz, desperately needing reassurance.Lt. Martinez, sir. 1st Platoon of the 2/5.We're... leveling it, Captain?But... there must be civilians stuck behind the line, sir.Let's go, marines! Clock's running. Focus on the mission. We're gonna get to that community center and get those people safe. A COBRA ATTACK HELICOPTER screams overhead, firing into the distance. Martinez turns to Nantz, shouting over the din:Something to add, Sergeant?Keep it together. Watch your angles. The aftershocks fade. Ominous quiet again. The squad continues DOWN THE STREET.Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Everyone stops firing. Nantz gets in Kerns' face.The sergeant is right. Stay on course. We have a mission...What is it, sergeant?Mottola, get on the radio. See if we can get some air support. Mottola starts working the radio, trying to remain calm as.'.. PROJECTILES EXPLODE in BRIGHT FLASHES around the marines.We're gonna get pinned down!Everyone... just calm down.I led us right into that ambush.Let's figure out how we get out of here. We'll medevac the wounded from that park.All right. We'll package the wounded, then rally on 10th street.All right, let's get to the community center... They head off, Simmons still supporting Guerrero as THWACK! An alien projectile slams INTO SIMMONS' THROAT. Choking, he CRUMPLES to the ground. Guerrero stands, blind, helpless. Panic. The marines spin, searching for targets.Move! Grab Simmons! Go, go! Stavrou hoists Simmons as the marines run off, FIRING to cover their retreat, as... The SILHOUETTES of DARK ALIEN FORMS are visible on distant rooftops, watching the rifle squad disappear down the street.You guys are 2/5?Where's the rest of your unit?All right. Stay with us. And the squad moves out...Load the wounded. Sgt. Nantz, Cpl. Harris-- let's find the civilians. Martinez, Nantz and Harris run to the community center as... The WOUNDED are hustled to the CHOPPER as it TOUCHES DOWN.Secure the perimeter! Stavrou, give me an ammo check. Cpl. Correggio, take three men, set up an Observation Post on the roof.They got air power, too... Knocked that medevac right out of the sky. So much for ruling the air. Nantz just keeps staring out.Listen, Sergeant. These men are scared. A little compassion would go a long way... Nantz turns on Martinez now.I...don't know. Right now, our job is just to get you to safety, okay? Harris appears from the hallway.Mission is still to get the civilians to the Forward Operating Base. We've got a battalion there, all that firepower... I was thinking, I saw a bus couple of blocks back on 11th...The FOB is here, at the airport... That's miles to cover with those kids... And those bombs are gonna drop in a little more than an hour. We've got to move fast.I made the call, Sergeant. It's my responsibility.If it runs, get it back here.How's it going?What is that thing?Looks like it's receiving a signal... Suddenly, the ORGAN CONVULSES rapidly. Expanding, contracting. Nantz sees the ALIEN'S GUN VIBRATING now, the whole arm TWITCHING, spreading through the alien's body like a seizure.This thing's still alive! Nantz pulls his KA-BAR FIGHTING KNIFE, thrusting it DEEP INTO THE ORGAN, twisting viciously.Good idea, Sergeant.We're in it together, Sergeant. Martinez slams a grenade into his launcher now.C'mon, Mottola. Get that bus here! Mottola is on the radio, frantic:Go! Get 'em out! Imlay swings the GYM DOOR OPEN, moving the civilians out.It's coming back...! The children scream, marines agitated... all hear a low vibration, echoing off buildings, heading their way.It's still coming... It's searching... Nantz grabs a PORTABLE RADIO. He looks around the bus, sees the little girl, Kirsten, ponytail in her hair. He leans down to her.Sergeant...That was some real John Wayne shit, Sergeant. Nantz tries to shrug it away. But Martinez nails him.Don't do it again. We work as a team, Sergeant. We clear? Beat. Nantz nods.Take the freeway, Corporal. Cuts half the distance off our drive.It doesn't seem like we're much safer out here. We've got two shitty options-- I'm choosing the one that gets us there fastest. We don't want to be in this area when the bombs start to fall.Jesus...Take the next exit. Head south. We're two clicks from the FOB. The bus drives onto the shoulder, past the sea of abandoned cars, heading to the off-ramp. Nantz appears uneasy. They are exposed on this freeway and he doesn't like it. He MOVES TO THE BACK, peering out windows, checking angles. Michele looks up as he passes, sees a GASH on Nantz' head.Guess you were right, Sergeant.Stavrou, get down that ramp, secure the street! Kerns, Adukwu, help get the civilians off the freeway. Stavrou starts off the bus for the broken off-ramp.Harris, Imlay, give us overwatch up on the roof. The rest of you push out 20 meters, set up a perimeter.Take someone to cover you!. Nantz turns, sees Correggio. Then he turns the other way, sees Kerns.Pull the men back... Pull 'em all back now, Sergeant. I'm gonna stay and cover.I said I got it...That's not your call, Sergeant. Now get your men outta here... He pushes Nantz away, looks around, the chaos slowing down for him. He reaches into his vest... Martinez hands the LETTER we saw earlier to Nantz. A moment between them.
