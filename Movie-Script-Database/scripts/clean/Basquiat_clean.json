{"Basquiat": {"RENE": {"raw_line": "In this town one is at the mercy of the recognition factor. One's public appearance is absolute.I consider myself a metaphor of the public. I am a public eye. I am a witness.Part of the artist's job is to get the work where I will see it.When you first see a new picture, you don't want to miss the boat. You have to be very careful because you may be staring at Van Gogh's ear.Nurse!!! Oh!!! Nurse!!! Carrot juice. Tofu burger. Rapido!Fine... A greasy cheeseburger. Fries - and a vodka.I need to make a call, Mary. You don't mind, do you?To Paris. Bernard Picasso - You know Bernard -... 'APT 20'... The church bells would ring at noon and six a.m.. 24 strokes: How many times we counted them. We called our bed the cloud. And there we'd float. The bathtub was in the kitchen and took forever to fill up. We'd bathe together afterwards. Oh the countless cigarettes and take out Chinese food... The bed was so narrow Three years we made it fit. The sheets were green the sheets were pink the sheets white linen from the past. Little home, farewell, The broken windows and the bodega on the corner. Now from my balcony I look out over all New York...\"The name of the game is survival, You learn it in jail upon your arrival!\"Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?Oh my, there goes the neighborhood. Who's house is this, anyway?That's what I like about you straight boys. You're so sensitive!!!I gotta go pee.Who did this? Who did this?It's fucking amazing. Motherfucker's got to put a crown on it.Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.Just look at him.MOTHAFUCKAH!I know that. Don't let him get away.Hey, wait up!!!You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read \"Not About Albert Milo?\" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star.I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates. But those big boys know how to fight. TheySounds famous already.Oh child... You got no respect. Didn't anyone teach you how to mount paintings?This is a very important season in New York. One's public appearance is absolute. Oh!!! Louise!!! I'd like you to meet Jean Michel Basquiat - SAMO. This is Henry Geldzahler.You or the museum?Five.That's five thousand dollars. He's from the Metropolitan Museum of Art so suck my pussy, you star.This is Jean Michel, whose work I told you about.I didn't have the subway fare. My Medicare ran out.You kidding? That's Annina Nosei. Jean's been in her gallery a thousand times. You slut. How do you know Bruno Bischofberger? He's only the biggest art dealer in Europe.3rd night I called him 'boy' He sed \"don't call me 'boy'\" \"Well Then don't call me 'Boss'\" That Was the end for us and I've Been seeing him for 2 1/2 years. In kangaroo court I want to beOh man! That's one looks famous already.You are a willful boy. How'm I s'posed to write about you if you keep changing everything?Uh huhh... Band practice? It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts - you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..Singing on stage and painting in your spareMy point exactly.So keep painting.You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true. There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?So shut up and keep painting..Thanks... I'll take it tonight.How about now?How does it feel to have a genius in the family?You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother - when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit.Forget it.SHHHHHH. Later. \"What is it about art, anyway......\"... that we give it so much importance? Artists are respected by the poor because what they do is an honest way to get out of the slum using one's sheer self as the medium. The money earned is proof pure and simple of the value of that individual... The Artist.The picture a mother's son does in jail hangs on her wall as proof that beauty is possible even in the most wretched. And this is a much different idea than the fancier notion that art is a scam and a rip-off. But you could never explain to someone who uses God's gift to enslave that you have used God's gift to be free.\"I'd like a glass of your best champagne, please? This is an enormously important season in New York, and to make a false step could have severe repercussions for years. We are no longer collecting art, we're buying individuals.Everything's over your head, Andy. Even Mr. Chow's menu. Thanks for not inviting meI'm starving. You can't buy advertising like this. This is the most glamorous dinner you'll have here this fall. How about some of that imitation crab?Isn't he great? Thanks, Jean.He owes me one.I haven't eaten yet!!!Hands off me, you faggots! I'm going. I'm going...I've kept Diana Vreeland waiting too long, anyway.His early work? He's only twenty-six!Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business.You're asking me? Nigga, please. After the way you treated me? This is the first time I've heard from either of you in months! I had to crash this party! You treated me like a suede biscuit. Rene don't play that!

Just the caviar - I'll get the rest.You check everyone's bills or just mine?I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors - anything with a SAMO tag on it. The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: \"Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?\"Yeah - I'd do that... You could teach me.Cool.Let's leave this town and go someplace.Ouch..That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.Hey George, what's up?He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?Why does everybody say that?

This is my version.Why, so you could humiliate me?What's with the wigs?You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig?Piss painting?How come you're not peeing on them yourself?If you ever want me to shit on 'em, just ask. You could finger paint.We can do better. It needed more white.I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says \"Warhol?People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now.That's better.After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's whatName?Number?Name?Number?Yo, Frank.I don't think so.Boom.That ain't ignorant - that's just stupid. Can I get you a bowl of gumbo?Hey, Rene.Here...

Just paint like a housepainter.Why don't you try letting her in, Steve - I mean Shenge.Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.Fine.It's unfinished. How 'bout some blue in the corner?What's wrong with you today?Don't look at me like that. It hurts my feelings.Well, that's better. You can buy direct from me.I need a dealer.Naa..See ya in an hour.

It's me - Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year?What do you mean?Hello? Gina?Hey, come here! Please. Just for a second. Open the door.Open up! Open up!My mother's inside.I'm not here to visit... I wanna take her home.Willie Mays... Nice to see you.How's Gina? You guys getting along?I guess it was a long time ago.Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!Just ring it up. I don't need a bag. Try this tabouli - it's great...My mom told me this... Or was it a dream?There was this little prince with a magic crown. An evil warlock kidnapped him, locked him in a cell in a huge tower and took away his voice. There was a window made of bars. The prince would smash his head against the bars hoping that someone would hear the sound and find him. The crown made the most beautiful sound that anyone ever heard. You could hear the ringing for miles. It was so beautiful, that people wanted to grab the air. They never found the prince. He never got out of the room. But the sound he made filled everything up with beauty.It's definitely time to get out of here.Hawaii? Fuck Hawaii. Let's go to Ireland.
