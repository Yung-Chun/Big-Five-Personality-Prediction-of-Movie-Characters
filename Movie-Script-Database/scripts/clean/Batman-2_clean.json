I take it you've been watching the news?I should inform you...Christmas is approaching, and we've received our annual solicitation from the Fireman's Toy Fund. If I may inquire...?Most ingenious, sir. What exactly it?To the untrained eye, sir, it looks remarkably like...the skeleton of an umbrella.Splendid, sir, and if I may say, I'm glad you're putting your time to such productive use. Now -- the Toy Fund. Our contribution last year was a half-million dollars...Then there's the foster-parents program... the Gotham homeless crusade...Miss Vale, sir...?He won't hear a word of it from me.I find you can't go wrong with surveillance equipment. Let me put this under the tree...Why, Miss Vale -- !I'm afraid so, Miss Vale. Master Bruce is sequestered in the cave.Ah, the public. Dishearteningly fickle.The Fluegelheim called again, sir. They want to know if you'll be attending the opening of the new Egyptian exhibit.Who's there?Mr. Wayne will see you, sir.Commissioner Gordon called. He wants to install a full contingent of police guards here at the manor -- in round-the-clock shifts -- to protect you from Batman.I told him that since you were Batman, you'd require no protection from Batman.In future, sir...I strongly advise against trying to fly off twenty-story buildings.One bruise, sir. Which covers your entire body.I shouldn't worry overmuch. I doubt the two of you move in the same circles.Sir -- such outmoded sexist attitudes are quite unbecoming.The police have no files whatsoever on Selina Kyle.What exactly are you --You mean she's some sort of -- collector? A...cat burglar, or --Raven, sir?How very odd. I'm sure it's nothing, but --Your father had a raven, sir. A small statue of the very sort you describe. It used to sit on his desk.After your father's...demise, Mr. Tiptree came to the house and asked if he could have it. As a keepsake. I saw no harm... That was thirty years ago.George Tiptree. Your friend Elliott's father.Thank you, yes, everything's fine. I'll expect your next call in an hour. The police are becoming an awful nuisance.I realized long ago -- that there are places in Mr. Wayne's heart which no one will ever penetrate -- or share. He loves you, Miss Vale. But in certain ways he will always be alone.I see, sir. When shall we expect you back?The subway, sir?How do you propose to get down there, sir? We can't have Batman strolling up to buy a token.What do you propose to do with him, sir? Keep him in the room for the rest of his life?The child is hurt, sir. At the very least we should attempt to locate his parents.How do you know that, sir?Sir -- it's Miss Kyle.Is this necessary, sir? After all...it is Christmas eve.I don't like to see you going out on a date...unprotected, sir.Everything's fine, thank you. We'll talk in an hour.Mr. Wayne. Is he -- ?You're no more than a common thief.I...don't...know...I think you're a dirty little man with a --Thank you, Master Dick. And...bravo.Don't be absurd.

Always gets me thinking about... And to tell you the truth, I'm a little -- concerned about Vicki.Yeah. I've been thinking about it lately. Thinking about it a lot... ...and I still can't figure out what to get her for Christmas.What'd you get me? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?-- Yeah.-- Yeah. I guess I'll pass on dessert.Sure.

You remember Vicki. -- How's the construction business?I'll think about it.I've known him since he was seven years old. He was a pig then too.What, tie him up with a bat-rope?Nice outfit.Ladies and gentlemen...I've been framed.My illustrious great-grandfather.

Says she's gonna leave me another ad...Cancel.Well, Alfred, it's official. I'm a wanted man. \"New evidence\"...I've gotta find that woman. Did you check the personals?I saw them occasionally. We all sat on the board of the Fluegelheim...No. I never liked the way they did business.Then Batman is behind all this.Well. He's changed tactics, hasn't he.You mean he's going after...the root of the problem.Changed my mind, Alfred. I'll be dropping in on the Fluegelheim after all.I just had a weird sense of deja vu.Good to see you two. Looks like the Five Families are suddenly down to three. In fact, if somebody dropped a bomb on this room right now --Not at all. Commissioner Gordon seems to think we should all be hiring bodyguards.Thing is, I can't imagine why Batman would be after us. Can you?I can't imagine why.They're proccupied. This string of murders --I think we've already met. -- This is quite an expedition you've put together.Sorry to disappoint you.What?No. Come on. What?Oh. Selina Kyle -- my friend Vicki Vale.Selina supervised the reconstruction of the temple. Brought it back from Egypt... stone by stone.Pull in the claws, okay? She's really terrific.Wait. Let me explain about Vicki --Relax, okay? I like you better.What have we got here?You're in a gruesome line of work.This one I know. It's a gryphon, right?Poor guy. Birds and cats -- you wouldn't think the two halves would cooperate.What was it you wanted to talk to me about?No.What are you attracted to?How?Is there a cat in here?Yeah, cats...ever since I was a kid... Look, I'd better get some fresh air. Maybe another time, okay...Great. What'd you tell him?Jesus, Alfred -- !!It's just a few bruises.I'm getting too old for this line of work. Cops placed me at the scene of the crime -- that weird kid of Vicki's saw my face ---- and I got the living shit knocked out of me by a woman.Selina. What are you doing here?You heard about Harry Provost.Same here.Not bad. Sarawak warrior caste.London...Cairo...Belgium...Her credit card records. Every major art theft in the last five years -- she's been on the scene or close to it.Could be. Museum curator, authenticator -- she's got the perfect cover for it. What would she want with that stupid raven?That's what the Catwoman took from Provost. A little raven statuette, about so big... But it couldn't have been that valuable.What, Alfred?What happened to it?Wait a minute. Mr. Tiptree?What are you looking for -- Batarangs?I brought you a Christmas present. Sorry about the wrapping -- the police made me open it.I think you may have something that belonged to my father.What are you talking about? Who?It's time you told me what's going on here.Whose fortune?The Five Families.-- that they were the ones behind the robbery?So they stole his piece of the puzzle.That doesn't matter. If he knew that his fortune was based on a crime -- a crime against the city... Reputation or not, he would've tried to --...Thanks for the testimonial.Tiptree's planning some kind of rendezvous with 'Batman.' I think Batman ought to be there when it happens.Get your cap. You're driving.According to this, he's directly below us.Yeah. Take a right.He's slowed down. Looks like he's under the park.I know another way in. Step on it. They're down there waiting for him.I can make you.I don't know, Alfred. I've got other stuff to worry about.He hasn't got any parents....I know.Stuff'll knock out a moose, much less a cat.She'll be ready for Batman -- but not for me. It's the only way, Alfred. I've got to take her out tonight.Christmas eve. No tree?I'm surprised you kept this date.

I'll give you the private tour.I understand. Anyone who's that protective must have a pretty good reason for it.He's just another rich idiot.
