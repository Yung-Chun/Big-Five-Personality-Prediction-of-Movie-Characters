But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and... I think something bad happened.I don't know.I was shot twice in the back.There was a gun. Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?I fought my way out of an embassy.
