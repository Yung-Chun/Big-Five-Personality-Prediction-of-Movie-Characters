{"Cherry-Falls": {"JODY": {"raw_line": "Cut it out.I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.I got to get home.Kenny....What?Daddy you scared me!What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.It won't happen again.Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!Hello. One second. Hey Adolph, it's the station!Hi.I dunno. My dad never came home last night.Yes Mr. Marliston?Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.I will. Is that all?SURE.Go sit next to him.Mark Shale.Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents.You eventually have to talk to him.You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.Just a little.No. Why?If they had ever gone all the way?You wouldn't?You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.You are 'sp fucking' wrong.But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.Does she fuck?Mr. Jenkins called on me in class today. It was so embarrassing. I was seriously spaced. I'd been thinking about Kenny for over twenty minutes. When I snapped out of it, I looked pathetic. I was teared up. Everyone was staring at me.That I was sorry. I'd drifted off. That I'd been thinking about Stacy and Rod.I was desperate. It was gross.He says he loves me.Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.I don't know what I'm so scared of.How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.I promised I'd go right home after school.Come in.What's wrong?How personal?What do you mean?Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.A little.Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!Not much further.Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!You are upset.I thought you'd be pleased.Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.Not that many.NO?!Hello?Yes?Yeah.Kenny's aunt?On what side of the family?His mother's an only child.Help!It was a she.She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.Someone tried to kill me.A little larger nose.That's her.You know her?Who is she Daddy?No I wasn't.Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.FINE. Are you?What?What party?No.Ok.I won't.You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?Stag?I can't right now.I'm fine.I did.Yeah. I think it's really sick.Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.Did Sharon say no?I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.I'm not using him as an excuse.I do not.I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.I'll think about it.Hi mom.Mom?I need to ask you something.Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman?Yeah. Who is she?I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.That's what he said.No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.The library. I'll be fine.Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?Twenty eight years ago.This place is empty.You heard about that?Don't you think it's sick?You Miss Dunlop?No.Is that you Miss Dunlop?Who's there?Mom? You were spying on me.Who is she?Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.You going to drag me out and me in my room until I go to college?Wait.I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.Attacked how?You didn't believe her?Why not?People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?And the police did nothing?How could you?The word is Mob.Who were they?The men. Do any of them still live around here?You're not telling me something.The principal?Who was the fourth?Dad?THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.NO!My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.So I should feel happy that he got away with it?Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?I'm making you feel like meat?You break up with me because I won't fuck you.You flaunt some slut in my face.And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.This party is sick.What?Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.I'm ok.Yes.I am.Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?Sure.You know about that too?Of course I'm scared.You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?I just feel so manipulated. By everyone. My dad, my boyfriend, and now some psychopath I don't even know.Really?Me? Why me?What do you know about my father?_ Your father raped someone?Yes.You're the killed.Help!Somebody help!No!My dad's down there!I can't walk. I think he cut right through a tendon.Go to the police station!Fuck! It's him.Thanks for coming back for me.Where are the police?Oh GOD IT'S HIM!What are you doing?Jimmy leave him alone! He's imbalanced.He's dangerous Jimmy!No!Kenny!Please!

Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.They're not picking me up until six.Yes!Jody! Yes! You're here.All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.I don't know. I kind of am.Are you coming to the party?Just making me feel like a piece of meat.Yeah.That's not why we broke up.Sharon's far from a slut.Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.Jody. Wait.I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.Just thinking about something.There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.I got to go.I'm worried about someone.Jody was right, this party IS sick.Hello? Jody?Oh, hey Mr. Marliston.

Goodnight.Hello. What?Where?I'm on my way.Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?No.But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.Hi honey.I just wanted to check that you were okay?How well did you know Stacy and Rod?Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?I want you to head right home after school.Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?She's my daughter, Tom.So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.Nice to meet you too. My daughter speaks highly of you.I guess we do.Is Jody still awake?Hi honey.I have a question to ask you. A personal question.I need to know how far you and Kenny went?Well, I assume you let him kiss you?I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?How much further?I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.You never went, uh, all the way?Ok.No honey.I'm not.I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.She's still a virgin.No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.is there anything you do?I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.Better than a pile of dead teenagers.I think you all know why I CALLED THIS Town meeting. In the last two days, three of our children have been murdered and it appears that we have now established a common link between the killings.All three of the victims attended our public high school and all three were or appear to have been...um...virgins.We found the word 'virgin' written at both crime scenes.We didn't think this was a serial killer. We thought it was an isolated incident.I can't say we are.What do you mean?I think that's' up to each and everyone of you.Are you sure?What are you doing?She's underage.It can't be.Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...I'll call you right back.You were eavesdropping.What did you hear?Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.What's the address? Thanks.There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.No. I'll handle this.Put a squad car at every entrance to town.I can't talk to her now.Tell her she has to handle it.No?Are you sure?I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours.I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.You know where I can find her?She works at a church?Of what?She was murdered?Can you describe her? How old was she?Can you get inside?I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.Is there a picture of her somewhere?No.No, you couldn't.Really?Why?Tom? Lisa Sherman is dead. But you'll never believe what I found out. Meet me at the Roadhouse on Route nine in a half hour.
