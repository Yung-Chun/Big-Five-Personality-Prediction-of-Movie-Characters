You remember me.Losing my touch.I know what I must look like. Rip Van Winkle. Feel like him. I could sleep for a year. Two years.Here, there. Run out of places now. They're gonna kill me.Your lot. Or their lot. Whoever gets me first. I'm innocent, by the way. Within reason. You going to find him then? The Mole?Few days. Needed somewhere to hide.Old habits.Calculated risk Mister Smiley. I wanted to see you, figured you'd turn up here sooner or later.There's a woman. I want you to trade for her. Get her back from Karla.Her name's Irina.I met her in Istanbul. They'd found some Russian trade delegate, name of Boris. He was spending high and wide in the nightclubs and some idiot thought we could turn him.I took one look and saw that he was a hood, Moscow trained.Probably coat trailing, trying to draw one of our men out into the open.He had a wife with him. Common- law.You baby-sit this one.Your bloke's a bit of a bastard. Just wanted to check you were alright.There was something about her.Nothing. Didn't have anything to tell yet. But... I could sense it in her.A secret.I played the businessman, Michael Trench. A Holiday Romance. Thought I'd take my time with it...But second date she made this open play...We've all got our strengths. And weaknesses.Me, I know women. She said she had a secret. The mother of all secrets. Said she'd only tell Control. She wanted to trade. New life for her and her kids.That's why they let her and Boris out. So, I said I'd tell the Circus.Wanted to find out more first. So, I waited her out.You can't expect them to jump at every offer of service. If they had more information...Well, if you won't tell me more, there's nothing I can do.I promise.Fuck off.Just that I had a Moscow Centre trained hood wanting to defect.I know what I am to the Circus. One of the scalp-hunters. Someone to give the dirty jobs to. I wanted to bring this one in myself.I said that she claimed to have information crucial to the well- being of the Circus.That she had information concerning a Double Agent.I was just trying to... to get the proper attention. And I told them to tell Mister Guillam that this was the reason I hadn't come home, not because I'd defected or anything.I waited for a reply.I waited hours but that was all they sent. It didn't make sense. Like they were stalling.They put her on a ship. That's all I know. I've done a lot of things Mister Smiley, but... I don't know why... I keep thinking about her.She wasn't even my type. I want to get her out. I owe her that.Who's going to keep you safe?S'right.November 20th. It would have been November 20th. Evening.She said there was a General, work-name Polyakov who was stationed in London. And that Polyakov's real job was to service the mole. He meets him regularly and takes back information the Mole gives him for Karla.If I go...... I want your word you'll get Irina back. Don't care who you have to trade. I want a family. Don't wanna end up like you lot...We're gonna live in Paris out of your hair. You'll get her back?Maybe I want them to find me.Ben stays here.Ricki Tarr claims to have further information vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.Read it aloud.That's the way Percy boy!

What's the access?But how could he possibly have access to...?We?If Witchcraft is genuine...Yes.Request for a thousand pound's in cash from the reptile fund.For a Mister Ellis.It was one of Jim Prideaux's work names.The date. Prideaux was killed in Hungary a year ago. October twenty first. So why wassomeone giving him a thousand pounds two months later?Hello, Ricki.You missed a wedge.Where've you been, Ricki?Who is?I'm going to try. How long have you been here?I wouldn't use my home as a safe house. There's every chance they're watching it.What do you want Ricki?What woman?You were due to fly home the next day. What did you tell London?Sense what?What made you so sure she wasn't coat-trailing?She had children in Russia?But you didn't?And what did your message say, Ricki?What else?I understand how you felt. You wanted to do something.Yes. I quite see that.And what else?What happened next Ricki?Where are you going Ricki? You said yourself, Karla will be looking for you. I can take you somewhere. Keep you safe.I'll go find her.Yes. I didn't sleep well. I want you to get something for me, Peter. I need the duty officer's log book for last November. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to send you up a floor, into the Lion's den. If you have the slightest reservation...If you're caught, Peter, you can't mention me. I'm sorry, but you're alone.Ricki's been helping us Peter. He's been telling us all about his adventures.As you did take the trouble to steal it...Ricki, you said you sent the Circus a telegram concerning Irina's information?What was the date?November 20th is missing. Someone is covering their tracks Peter. Unless you think that's just a coincidence?Thirty thousand isn't so much for Karla to pay if it protects his Mole. I'm afraid someone in the Circus knows all about Mister Tarr and is doing everything they can to discredit him.You recognize that handwriting? That's Toby Esterhase.Secrecy is a habit.What for?I met him once. Karla.In fifty-five. Moscow Centre was in pieces. Purge after purge. Half their Agents were jumping ship and I travelled around signing them up. Hundreds of them.One of them was calling himself Gerstmann. He was on his way back to Russia, and we were pretty sure he was going to be executed. Plane had a twenty-four lay over at Delhi, and that's how long I had to convince him to come over to us instead of going home to die.Little room...I'm sitting here...he's sitting there...The Americans have had him tortured.No fingernails. It's incredibly hot. I'm very tired and all I want to do is get this over with and get back home. Things weren't going well with Ann.I give him the usual pitch... Come to the West and we can give you a comfortable life. After questioning. Or you can catch your plane and fly home and be shot, like Bykov, Shur, Muranov...Think of your wife. You have a wife, don't you? I brought you some cigarettes, by the way.Use my lighter.\"We could arrange for her to join you, we have a lot of stock to trade. If you go back, she'll be ostracised. Think of her. Think about how much she...\"Kept harping on about the damn wife! Telling him more about me, than... Should have walked out, of course, but for some reason... it seemed important to save this one. So I go on. \"Know you're a chain-smoker, help yourself,\" \"We're not so very different you and I..\"Look, we've both spent our lives looking for the weaknesses in one another's systems. Don't you think it's time to recognise there is as little worth on your side as there is on mine?Never said a word. Not one word. Next morning he got back on his plane, gave the pack of cigarettes back to me, untouched - this was a chain-smoker, mind - and flew off to what he presumed would be his death. He kept my lighter. It was a gift - \"To George, from Ann. All my love.\"Yes. And that's how I know he can be beaten. Because he's a fanatic. And the fanatic is always concealing a secret doubt.That's the thing. I can't remember.After today, Peter you have to assume they're watching you. If there's anything you need tidied up... now's the time.How. I need to talk to you about the night Jim Prideaux was killed, Jerry. You were duty officer, weren't you?You rang my house?What did you say?Go on.The Saville.Peter...It's not him, Peter.Because he was at my house that night. With Ann.I quite like this.Yes. Pleasant enough.Which means I was...?What did you make of it, Jim? Control's theory?But still you went? Risking your life for a mission you thought was absurd? Why?Perhaps some part of you wanted to know if Control was right? Wanted to know if there was a Mole, who it might be?What did you tell them?No. They were blown. The story is you blew them to save your own skin.What was your last line of defence?Why?What else?Did they ask about me at all?What did he say about me?That was well said.Try and put it all behind you, Jim.Jim?Nobody you need concern yourself with. An unfortunate...He said when he got out, when he was being debriefed at the Nursery, he had a visitor.Toby Esterhase.He gave him a thousand pounds. Told him he was dead now and couldn't come back. Had to become a Lotus Eater - forget everything that happened - Control's theory, Tinker, Tailor... all of it.Yes, that's what I thought. How on earth did Esterhase hear about \"Tinker, Tailor?\"Will you watch my back, Peter? Look out for a solo. Just a feeling I've had.What exactly did Irina say?Perfectly, Minister. There is a house, somewhere in this city, where Alleline and the others meet Witchcraft's London representative. I need the address of that house.It's Lacon's advice I'm following. You told me to follow in Control's footsteps.I'm glad you take some of the credit.The man Alleline and the others meet is called Polyakov. You believe his role is to bring information from Witchcraft to you. His real role is to receive information from the Mole to take back to Karla.Made possible. By you. When he steals our secrets he does it under the very nose of the Circus, in the house which you persuaded the treasury to pay for. I'm sure you'll be able to take full credit for that.Just enough glitter, amongst the chicken-feed. Control didn't believe in miracles and he didn't believe in Witchcraft. But you were lazy and you were greedy and so you hounded him out of the Circus and you let Karla in.We are not the prize. We're the bait.You've opened negotiations to exchange intelligence with the Americans. What they tell the Circus, they'll be telling the Kremlin. Witchcraft's information, the \"gold\" Karla let you have? It wasn't to lure you. It was to lure the Americans. Now, do you want to take credit for that?We have one thing the Mole wants.I'll do my utmost, Ricki.Keep walking please.I want to talk about loyalty Toby. Control recruited you when you were trying to escape from Hungary didn't he? A wanted man. Saved you from a KGB bullet, didn't he? And yet, when the time came, when it came to picking sides between him and Alleline, you didn't hesitate? Understandable perhaps, with your war experience. You've survived this long, I suppose, because of your ability to change sides, serve any Master?It's about which Master you've been serving, Toby.Intelligence has been leaked, Toby. Someone's been taking files from the Circus...The files were delivered to a Russian attache, weren't they?Operation Witchcraft? Yes, I know.Who gave you the message for Jim to forget about Tinker Tailor?To get rid of Connie Sachs? Westerby?You're just the messenger? Running between them all. Anything to serve Witchcraft?I know all about your secret source. And I know something you don't. I know who he is. He's Karla.One of you has been giving Polyakov the Crown Jewels.Are you still a wanted man, Toby?You picked the wrong side, Toby.Give me the address. Where do you meet Polyakov?What are the safety signals?Where is the mike, Mrs McCraig?And what's the procedure?If you're at all worried you can call Lacon from the basement phone. Let's try the tape recorder shall we?How's he look?I'm here, Mendel.I was assured there would be no coercion.If I can.Of course.I did have one or two questions. About Prideaux.Yes, yes you did. That was good of you. I'm surprised Karla didn't shoot him. Or do you think he held back out of delicacy towards you?Did Prideaux come and see you before he left on his Hungarian mission?To say what?To warn you. Because he knew, deep down, it was you all along.Did Karla ever consider having you take over the Circus?What are you then?Is there anything you want me to pass on to Ann?Up to a
