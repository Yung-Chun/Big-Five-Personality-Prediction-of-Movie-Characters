{"Burning-Annie": {"MAX": {"raw_line": "There's an old joke. It comes from \"The Iliad,\" but I think it was popularized by Oscar Wilde. It goes like this: ...A bear's taking a shit, like, out in the woods one day. And he sees this rabbit, also taking a shit. The rabbit, wait, I mean, the bear, he's shitting up a storm, cuz he's been eating Mexican. The wiping's taking forever, and his shit keeps sticking to his fur. Wait, what happens next? Oh, right-- he asks the rabbit if he ever has trouble wiping. The rabbit says no, shit just slides right off him. So the bear picks the rabbit up and wipes his ass with him. Well, I never said it was a good joke. And see, that makes it perfect, because it's pretty much the story of my life.Growing up, my parents were huge Woody Allen fans. Still are. Personally, I hate him. Same thing with the Beatles, such a part of my background that I must have been about 16 by the time I realized how useless it was to rebel by ignoring the Beatles or any other cultural artifact of their generation. Even if I did spend my childhood hearing my father go on and on about how, like, Nirvana would never mean anything because they're not the Beatles, blah-blah. I don't know, this is all starting to sound a little bit too angsty, you know, and that's about the last thing I'm going for here... Shit, I really got off track there, didn't I?Anyway, like the Beatles thing\u00ad and this is the point of that whole long-winded example\u00ad I was force-fed Woody Allen from a young age. I remember watching Bananas when I was about five. Of course, I hated it.This is my old house. We lived here, in a dull suburb of New York, until I was ten, when we moved to a different house in a different dull suburb of New York.Oh yeah. This wasn't the first time I saw Annie Hall, but it was the first time I actually appreciated it. I was flipping channels on a Saturday afternoon, and there it was, and I was stunned to find I loved it, more stunned to find that my parents may have had a point all along. [MORE]Oh God, high school. I hated this place. I was a Junior when I gave up trying to fit in. Fortunately, being a social outcast is a lot easier when your school is filled with idiots.There was something in Annie Hall I identified with. Maybe it was the style of humor, or the defeatist attitude, I don't know. All I know is, I kept going back. Different people are inspired by different things, and my source of inspiration became a 20-year-old movie about a failed relationship.So after high school I ended up here. There was never really any choice, not going to college was not an option. Of course, I brought Annie with me. Good thing, too. [MORE]Watching it quickly became about the only thing I could count on to go right.It was freshmen year when we started watching Annie Hall as a tradition. Jeez, this must have been the very first time. What's Amy doing here? I'm pretty sure Amy wasn't here.That's Sam and Jen. Sam was the alpha- male of our group, which tends to consist mostly of zeta-males. He had been going out with Jen a couple weeks and we were all waiting to see if she would change him...Uh, thanks, I guess. Does that mean you liked it?Well, at least you're being honest.I'm the only person I know who gets insulted in his own fantasies.Anyway, Amy set the tone for the rest of college...And even when it went right, it didn't....And then I, then I, after I called the pizza place, I called an ambulance, and timed them.The pizza, of course. The paramedics took 35 minutes to arrive.The Station Manager said I couldn't go on the air ever again.I gave him the pizza!It would never work.I know. I have a sixth sense.I see dead relationships.That was all true, but there was something else, though. I mean, there I was, drunk, in a girl's bedroom, and the only thought running through my mind was......\"What about Beth?\"I mean, I know we're just friends, but you really mean a lot to me and we've been spending a lot of time together lately, and maybe... I guess what I'm saying is, maybe we could try going out on a date or something?I mean, it wouldn't have to be, uh...We wouldn't have to... What?Um, yeah, it would have to be after, or maybe... Yeah, tomorrow, uh, tomorrow night's fine.Not until Sam and Jen.I don't get what the fuss is. I knew you and that Chris guy wouldn't last a week as soon as I saw you together.Or incredibly sad. I'm amazed I'm the only one who can tell. Take any couple. If it's not incompatible lifestyles, it's conflicting priorities. If it's not that, it's usually clashing levels of self- esteem. It's always something.Well, just because I see it, doesn't mean I talk about it. I don't say a word to my suitemates.Oh, come on, we have philosophical discussions all the time.To name one hot-button issue, yes. You want us to talk about girls? Sam is nearly married to Jen, Charles doesn't want his relationships to last, Tommy's girlfriends are located in online chatrooms across the country, and Scott, well... you know.What are doing here?What?\"Reservation\"?Well, this isn't exactly what I had in mind.For starters, I have a serious problem with spending any time in the library when I don't have to. I'm here once or twice a year as it is. Plus... What's the point of seeing this together if we're wearing headphones? [MORE]Why not be with a life-sized cardboard cut-out? That way you can be with someone famous, even a dead person. Wouldn't you rather be with Elvis?Or Batman?I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm a little nervous. It's like, our first date and everything.I can't believe how many great lines there are. Even the little throwaways, like when she parks and he's like, \"That's okay, we can walk to the curb from here.\"Yeah, me too.Uh, sure, sometimes...What? You want me to get a tattoo or something?Obviously you've never met my mother.I guess you really haven't met my mother...Wait a second.About what?No wait, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, hold on.No, it wouldn't!I don't know that.I'm starting to get the idea.Things weren't the same after. We quickly became the kind of friends who say Hi on the paths but don't stop walking. Then, she moved across campus and changed majors, and basically, except for the random phone call, I haven't seen her in ages.All these dates had one thing in common! And it took Charles, of all people, to point it out to me.This morning, we were skipping class.It's ridiculous that even at a liberal school like this, I have to put up with anti-Semitism.He couldn't just fail me, think about it. The paper was about my grandparents' experience in the Holocaust.You don't understand, you're not Jewish.But the professor probably thinks I am.You know what else? I think he might be German.I'm not sure. It is the beginning of the semester, it's time for our Annie Hall night.What are you talking about? If you're sick of Annie Hall, that's one thing, but don't blame our sad little lives on it.Alone? Last semester you hooked up with like a dozen women.Where did you get this grudge against my favorite film?And anyway, your theory fails to account for our collective dorkiness and bad haircuts. Plus, look at Sam.So look at what not watching can do to you.What a nightmare. I dunno why I can't stop thinking about these things. I guess I've been a little restless lately, since getting back from winter break. Everything's been kind of weird lately.Hope you enjoyed this week's Reggae Revelry Hour. This is Max filling in for Rasta Ronnie, taking you out with a little Bad Religion.Who cares? It's unnatural. If I went into a stranger's house and ate their food under any other circumstance, I'd be arrested.Tommy, at last. Save me from this lounge lizard.Cheers to a new semester, full of potential that will surely go to waste.Good luck, and may she have a sister.Ah, forget about Sam. I don't like it any more than you.Hey, he was one of my best friends. Now we share a room and he's like a stranger.Yeah, right, then if you fail to sodomize her, you'll blame me. Me, or Annie Hall.The problem is, every crazy theory explains something. I took a class last semester with a professor who claimed that the planet is being destroyed by white, male, meat-eating capitalists.But she had a theory that explained how: apparently racism, sexism, socialism, environmentalism, and vegetarianism are all inherently linked. I brought a Big Mac to the first class, and I thought I was going to be the victim of a vegan- socialist uprising.Wow, the laws of nature have stopped working. Maybe I should try to meet some chicks after all.Sucks. Who are they trying to be, with this wine and cheese? What kind of party doesn't even have beer?Changing your girl for a major.It wouldn't be an issue.I meant, I'd have to have a girl first. And lay off the radio show. There's a reason I took the 3am slot.I should be, procrastination is one of my favorite hobbies. Isn't it funny that my two favorite hobbies rhyme?I can't believe you think they're mediocre. Those guys rock.It could have been better but it could have been worse. For me, that's good.I dunno, it's a bunch of 21-year-olds who want the 18-year-olds to know how mature they are.Never hook up with people in your cast.I'm Max.I'm Max. Oh my God, you heard my show?You don't get it, I can't do my show if I even suspect someone is listening. Now I have to change time slots. Again.No, it's no good, the whole episode is ruined. This is a disaster.What?!Uh, when did you tune in? I need to know which episode you ruined.And she hung up. \"This isn't the place for that kind of talk...\"Perhaps she'd been screwed by politicians. Phone sex is just pretend but politics... I know my ass is still sore.Wait, wait. How did you know about my show?Anybody I know? Oh, duh, I guess it would have to be someone I know.What, really?Busted.How can you stand that show?\"Cutie\"?We just met. I was working up to it.Hello? Beth?... Sorry... Hello...? Hey, how's it going?... Yeah, in person... Too long... So anyway, I just wanted to say hi, and also, stop telling people to listen to my show... Of course I'm serious... Stop laughing... Of course I haven't changed...You all right?No, I mean, I thought I heard you fall or something.That sucks. Bad way to start the day.This is funny, in a way. Yesterday you were complaining about not having any girls. Now you're complaining because you have one.Want me to tell you?Speaking of failed relationships, I was thinking about your Annie Hall theory. Specifically, I was thinking that you're insane.It's like you insulted my religion. Like, \"Hey, Cardinal, I think Jesus might be why you're not getting laid...\"It's not my fault Annie Hall's honest about the futility of romance.Forget it, I hate Manhattan.My Uncle Harry didn't seem to mind.Actually, I'm supposed to eat with Beth.I dunno.So? Think of all the people who've died in hurricanes. I bet they think it's a worthy issue.Okay, okay. So, what classes are you taking?What? No.No, I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. To be honest, it's nice being with someone besides my suitemates for a change.Do you have to get eggs? I'm allergic.It's just that, it's the smell. It's the smell that bothers me.Look, if you're going to have eggs, let me at least switch seats with Sam, so I'll be farther away from it.Alright, alright, you win, we'll switch. Come on, Beth, get up.You owe me. Remember when you threw that egg at me in the dining hall?Oh, hey. Yeah, I hate coming here this time of day, but I need money. You know, gambling debts and all.I can't support an acronym without knowing what it stands for. I once joined NAMBLA because I thought it was an animal rights group.So, are you a junior, too?What're you majoring in?It was my second question.I'd be honest. Oh, wait. Media Studies. This week, I'm majoring in Media Studies. I used to be a double-major, Renaissance Footwear and Neurosurgery, but, ya know, it was just too hard to get course credit for watching movies.Why don't you just be undeclared?Uh, I forgot, my bookie takes checks now.Actually, yes. But I need something from you.Your name.Okay, Julie with no nickname, I, um, I'll see you around?It's only Monday.She probably won't even go.This conversation is starting to bother me.This is ridiculous. What other art form involves industrial toxins and complex chemical reactions? Nobody ever got cancer from dancing.I'm serious. Chemicals make me very nervous. Isn't this how the Unabomber got started?Uh, boy, this fixer smells delicious...I, uh, I mean, the truth is, it's not a topic. It doesn't bother him, or us. Or I mean, he doesn't talk about it.Yes, I mean, no, not with us, anyway.Listen. All I'm trying to say is, you're not a topic that comes up very often.Well, that's not... what I meant. Oy.Listen, Amanda. Scott likes you as much as we all do, so it doesn't leave much room for discussion. We mostly only talk about what we hate.Yeah, I know.Shit!Hey, remember the scene in Swingers when they play this? That was awesome. I love movie scenes I can relate to.No, you're thinking of Chasing Amy.They both did.Mallrats, Clerks, and Dogma.Doesn't count, it was just an ad for all his other films.Why? We do it real life. We're doing it right now. What you're saying is, if this was a movie, it wouldn't be any good.But if our lives were a movie, you'd never be able to say that. You'd be giving the critics the perfect quote to pan it with.Are you okay?Video hockey is my game. Like a swan, I mate for life.Holy shit, you and Jen broke up.Okay, so what happened?Porn?Jesus. You think you know someone pretty well and then they do something like this.Fifty bucks says there's a message on the machine when we get back.Don't you know that no matter how often girls tell you they want honesty, they never really mean it? Nobody does!It's too bad it ended like this. I'm really sorry.Jesus, that film...-- Have you heard Charles' theory?I can't believe you said that to her. That's so cool.No.Scott, why don't you go for her? You seem to get along well.You're exaggerating.Bad example: it could never get that bad.Shit, she's here.No. She's, she's just a girl. I shouldn't have mentioned it.Yeah.Yeah, it's \"Julie\"... Julie. She's cute, and she seems interesting, but I'm sure she has all kinds of horrible flaws I don't know about.What do you mean?I wonder if maybe I should go say hi.Do you know the guys she's talking to?Shit, shit, shit, she's looking this way. Fuck. What should I...?You're right. I can't deprive her of that.Hey.Fine. I, uh, really like your jacket. Is that real carpet?Aloha?Dweezil or Moon Unit?\"Apostrophe\"?I thought he was correcting my grammar.Okay.Uh, yeah, sure.No thanks. I'm kinda picky about beer. I'm more into stuff like Guinness, Bass, Killians.It's a coincidence, I swear.Yeah, I don't know. Giving me pot is like letting Richard Simmons smoke crack. I'm paranoid enough as it is.Wow. I bet you could use that for yard work.Kind of like why I stopped playing Dungeons and Dragons. It was, uh, in sixth grade, but it was kind of similar.\"Ampersand\"? What kind of name is that, Esperanto?He must have been listening to \"Apostrophe\" at the time.How much did that cost? Because I have a friend who wants to change his name to Not Bill.No, Not Bill.Originally he wanted to change it to something else.C'mon, I thought hippies were mellow.Sorry, Popeye, I guess I was thrown by the Dave Matthews merchandise.Well shouldn't you be back there date- raping someone?Hey, it's okay. I'm cool.So you live here, huh? Does it bother you to be in an all-female dorm?I bet they do.Oh, fine, uh, next time I'll bring Jack Nicholson and a case of Schnapps.Uh, hi...I don't know, I'm sure I have something to do that I've forgotten.We had breakfast.You cancel on me, too.Look, the whole thing was my fault. Let's drop it, okay?Okay, lunch, you win.Guilt is a powerful force. Just be glad it's on our side for once.Awful, just like every other time of day. Their food is just birdseed prepared fancy.Fine.Me too.You call her back?Imagine that.Don't put me in the middle of this. Are you definitely broken up? Because it seems a little up in the air.Don't even think of it.Um, it's for a friend.No, seriously, I just got a job at a petting zoo.And the best part is, it's work study. I think the Psych. department's involved.So, uh, got any plans tonight?Um, sure. Might be cool to catch a band before success ruins them.I can't believe what you just did to me!Julie was just here!What were you doing sitting in the car then?Me too.Oh, hey! It's good to see you.Who are these guys?Luck had nothing to do with it.You have to wonder about any band whose highlight is their exit.I'm sorry, the who?I still can't believe you tuned in. It's like an invasion of privacy.So, uh, I'm sorry about that thing with, uh, Chip was it?He's lucky, I, uh, almost pulled a Jackie Chan on his ass, but, you know, my kung- fu's gotten rusty since I left the Hong Kong military.Right. Asking me not to worry is like asking a bear to use toilet paper. There's this joke that sums it up for me...What?I hope he's a better dancer.Did I ever tell you about the bear and the rabbit in the woods--?Wait.Okay. Okay. We barely know each other, but you're all I think about.Oh, thanks. I bare my soul and now you're the funny one.Now it's your turn, right?Fuck. I sure hadn't guessed that.Since high school, wow.Uh, I have a friend who says it's because I watch Annie Hall too much.Exactly. That film practically raised me.Be careful what you wish for.Snowtires?Know any?Sure. I know this place. Their food is bad, but they compensate by being overpriced.Say, did that guy look like...?I've been able to do it since high school.That's the real tragedy. Look at all the unhappy couples in the world.See how ridiculous dating is?What do you mean? That's what Annie's all about.Why is your radio set to the campus station?I thought Beth told you about me.If it did, do you think I'd be here? I'd be down at the Porsche dealer with a ski mask and an Uzi.Well, sure, there's that, but it would also be nice to have a car with a heater.No, I can't tell just by looking. I need some info.Uh, just a description.That's plenty.Sorry. It's all in there. You qualified \"tall\" so as not to make him appear too handsome, said \"friendly\" like a euphemism, chose \"fixes cars\" instead of the more dignified \"auto mechanic,\" and finally, mentioned his brother \u00e1 propos of nothing, like you're threatened by him.I'm such an idiot. She's going to shit in our food now. I can't believe you asked her that.What are you, a fortune cookie?I had a coupon.I thought they broke up when Stevie left.Wonder, horror, it's such a fine line...Sometimes I look around and wonder where the hell my friends came from.Like, the other night Tommy and Sam nearly got into a fistfight over whether the X-Files is based on a true story.Before that, Scott covered the entire bathroom in multi-colored post-it notes, which Charles somehow set on fire, nearly getting us kicked out of housing.They're great friends. I feel safer among them than among my own family. [MORE]Even when Beth was part of the group, she didn't fit in. Like, she never just lets things be. She always has to know exactly what I'm thinking. It was sort of cute when we were friends, but now it's like a proctology exam. Hard to imagine a friendship going more wrong.Ah, but Julie. Juliejuliejulie. She's smart, she's funny, isn't constantly hassling me. How she can stay such a dreamer is beyond me... Hey, I wonder if she's listening now.Hello? Uh, Julie...? So, uh, as I was saying... Um. My friends. Yeah. My friends are weird. Shit. I think it's time for some music.I don't want to talk about it.Yeah. This is a real change of pace. Staying away from Annie Hall is like some kind of magic trick.You know how when things are going badly, there are certain parts I like to watch?I realized that I don't know what part to watch when things are going well.Are you on crack? I meet a girl I really like, that I may actually have a chance with, and you want me to put it all in jeopardy?But it's ruining my life.See? The theory works for you, too.What?!How could you sleep with Beth?Happen again? Of course not! That might constitute a relationship!I don't care! Oh God, this is my fault! If only I hadn't called her...You've gotta be kidding.I dunno where I'm going.Yeah. I figured I'd had enough actual food this week.Yeah, why?What? Now?But I just left him in the General Store...I don't even know him. What's so special about this guy, anyway? I mean, are you and he...?I guess so. You know, we should try to be more exciting. Like the other day, I waited until the last minute before returning a video. And next time, I swear I'm not going to rewind.Boy, are we pathetic.Yeah. Me too.I feel the same way about the Sex Pistols. Missing them is far cooler than having them around.What do you mean, you saw Julie with someone?So what are you saying?Who was he? What did he look like?How could she see someone else?But we might be! I can't handle competition, Sam, I'm not the competitive type.I can't compete with that! Man, it's all gone so wrong, so fast.Yeah, do you know where Julie is?Yeah...Oh, yeah, Judy. Right.Uh, thanks.Uhhhh... No! I mean, not much.Well, uh, the guy said it's too hard to draw two grown men kissing. Say, which one is Julie's room?So...! Uh, do I come here often, would you say?Judy let me in!I was, uh, in the area and thought I'd pop in. Find out how your day went.Great. I had lunch with a dear, dear friend.Probably not. She's a foreign exchange student. Spends a lot of time modeling.Yeah, the agencies won't leave her alone. We had, uh, quite a lunch. Lots of shellfish, and wine. And, uh, rhino's horn.Well, yeah, uh, she's on the kosher meal plan. Look, I gotta go. Nice seeing you again.I just made an ass of myself.Ha-ha.Yeah, you've got real problems. Do you have time to talk?You shouldn't talk, theater major.Why didn't you just leave? At least you can escape your problems.I just got my textbooks for this term.When the gods give you a sign like that, there's only one thing to do.Was she alone?Oh, great.What are you saying, I like her because she's like Annie Hall?Oh my God, I think you're right.I don't want to like someone because she reminds me of someone in a movie. Now I'm wondering why I like her. Maybe I don't.No. I don't know how to play it.Oh, shit, I forgot about lunch!Hey, I'm here, right?I'm sorry. Are you still upset about the thing with Steve?Well, you know. Nothing even worth mentioning.It's nothing.Actually, um, yeah, it's Julie.Well, I'm not sure I'm that into her.She reminds everyone of Annie Hall.God, I'm such an idiot! That film is finding more and more ways to ruin my life.Look at my life. Look at this thing with Julie.The worst part is, maybe I knew this all along.And Annie Hall's not even my type.I'm into bipeds with most of their teeth. No Lutherans or fictional characters.That's not two choices, that's one.Well, I must admit, it would be... Annie Hall.Don't feel bad, you came in second.It's only because you'd laugh at more of my jokes in bed. It adds a whole other dimension-- you'd be laughing with me in addition to at me.Yeah.I'm weird.Girls think I'm a loser.Yeah. It's corny, but there's something about her that brings me happiness.Look, either go somewhere else, or stay in your room.You already did.Julie's coming over to watch a movie. I don't want to take any chances.Since Scott joined a video club, we've got a lot of shitty movies you'll ever Oo, here's Buffalo `66, that's a need. great flick.Ummm, no.No.Um, no, it's just the box. The tape inside is wrestling.Um, it's been recorded over...No, of course not.I, I know, it's just, I watched it last week. How about Airplane?Huh?Why did you?Really? I'll, I'll have to remember that later.Actually, my memory's not what it used to be. If I don't act on this information now...Sorry.Are you comfortable, I mean, is this okay?Hey. Guys, um, this is Julie. Julie, this is my roommate Sam, and that's Tommy, who also lives here.What?But the movie is... Okay. Do you want me to walk you home?I wish I smoked.Yeah, and it's the only thing between me and my dream of becoming Steve McQueen.You call that pillow talk? We used to be. There were times I would have been lost without her. Other times, it was like the lost leading the lost.We tried something once, but it was a disaster.Sometimes I'm not sure if I have a say in it. On a campus this small, it's like she's everywhere.That's what summers are for. The school year is for reckless debauchery.Jesus, I have to get going. I'll never get my homework done if I sleep all weekend. Ah, fuck it, who cares.This, coming from the girl who thinks college is bullshit.It's different. Some things aren't quite as impressive in the light of day.Of course not. I'm a big fan of it.What are you doing tomorrow?The worst kind.Hello. Nobody is here right now. Please leave a message. BEEEEEEEP.You're listening? I told you not to listen!Hey, where'd the music go?I don't get it, it stopped when I picked up the phone.Woah!Don't be too proud of your five seconds of fame. More people would hear us if we shouted out the window.Didn't I tell you not to listen to my show?Well, all these songs are about you.Man, I'm sorry. Go back to sleep.I didn't sleep either, but for some reason I'm still refreshed. I feel great.It's Julie. Last night we officially became a couple.We hooked up.It meant something to me.Still down about Jen, huh?Oh, man, I'm sorry.You guys were together a long time.Have fun in Saturday lab.Yeah...Yeah, this game's so much fun.Sam said the same thing. He's still depressed.A non-denial denial. I invented that. She's learned from the best.Happiness is a warm gun.What about Beth?You just came from Jen's, huh?Well, that took the wind out of my sails.It's barely lunch, why are you dressed up?I don't wanna go to a birthday party. I'm broke, and I wanna hang out with Julie.Six pages? That's nothing. Triple spaced, in 14 point type, that's only like 500 words. If a picture's worth a thousand words, that's like a bad photocopy.What are you, from Maine?Phew, because I don't know if I'd be able to handle something like that. That's a hard thing to drop on a person.Shit, I'm sorry.It sounds it.Look out for that truck!Watch the driveway!Anyway, everyone's dying to meet you.This is going to be fun. All my friends, meeting my girlfriend. It's going to be great.Uh, yeah...What, really?My grandfather once told me that if you love your job, you'll never work a day in your life. He's 98 years old, addicted to C-SPAN, and had to be removed from a supermarket recently for shouting about Republicans.Heheh, I bet that's why they call it \"academic.\"So what's everybody going to order then?Are you sure?It'll be fun, just the two of us.Why would she do that?See?That's the worst excuse I ever heard. I mean it. So... you wanna hit the video store?Ah, shit, no.Boy, what an uplifting movie. Such a refreshingly positive message.Right?How can you say that? Annie Hall is so uplifting!But it's still early.Okay, how about right... now?There's your mistake. Mindless happiness is always better than thoughtful reservation. Unless you're talking about nude bungee jumping.But, but... we just saw a movie about how relationships are worth it, no matter what happens.Yeah, I guess we really did.Was? Is. Wait... Oh, shit!But that was him, not me.What's successful? Like, my parents have been married thirty years, but--Okay, bad example. But why think ahead? We're here, now. Can't we just enjoy our time together?What was all this, I mean, was any of it\u00adBut it might lead to... happiness.I knew that damn film was cursed! Why did I listen to Charles instead of Annie?What are you talking about? It's a fucking textbook.I know. I don't know. I mean... Good-bye.Who says we're smarter?Very funny, Mr. Wizard. If I learned anything useful in my classes, I'd be rubbing it in your face.She just ended a long relationship and she doesn't want anything serious.No, it's dead. And the thing I don't get is, it was all going so well. There was a moment when we kissed, when it was more than a kiss...It was like we broke through all our layers, you know, all the manners and defense mechanisms and daily crap, and I saw a flash of something, a glimmer of hope or happiness or whatever, something I inspired in her. But now it's over and I'll never see that part of her again.There's a metaphor we can all relate to.I think I prefer Goldeneye.Oo, witty.You know, there's this joke...You know the joke?Yeah, that's the one.But I think I know what it means now.Not this time.Beth, I just want to say, before it's all over and I don't have the chance, that I'm sorry. For everything. Last semester and last year.You mean the world to me, and I was an idiot to throw it away. You were right: if I can't be a friend to you, how could I be a boyfriend?

interrupt, I thought I heard one of you say \"Max.\"Oh, great, just as I hoped. I just wanted to say, I heard your radio show last week and I thought it was great. Thoughtful and poignant and funny, too. You know, you look just like I imagined, too.Huh?You're Max? Then who are you?You okay? You look like you're in pain.I'm sorry, I didn't realize I wasn't supposed to listen.Alright, listen. I was kidding. Your show actually kind of sucked.Just kidding! It was awesome.At one point you dialed a phone sex line. It was hilarious. It's not every day someone calls 1-900-4RIMJOBS to discuss politics.Yeah, it's like, for four dollars a minute, you should talk about whatever you want. You know the country's in trouble when a phone sex operator thinks talking politics is beneath her.Listen, I'm being flagged down by my over- protective friends. It was nice meeting you, though.Someone mentioned you.It was from a good source. I was told I'd like you, but to really know you, I should hear your show.It was Beth.Hi. Look at this line.Aren't ATMs great? They save so much time. Think about what life must have been like before them.I'm listed as a sophomore, but I've taken some time off.Why is that always the first question?And how would you answer it?I bet. Me, I'm in Soc., but I'm leaning toward Business, or Psych. Or Art History.Not my style.Are you okay? I thought you needed money.Seriously, is everything okay?What?It's Julie, no nickname. Don't even think of calling me \"Jewel.\"Probably.Max! What's going on?Do you guys know Max? This is Mark......And Andy.Sure.You want mine?Andy, what are you looking for?Yeah. I used to, but when it became my social life I knew I needed to stop.Is his name Bill?What about originally?Gee, Mark, that's really cool.Mark, lay off. Go take a hit off the Hoover and mellow out. Max, I'm sorry.Nah, it's time. It's getting late anyway.No, well, a little, sure. But there are always men around. During fire drills, more guys come out than girls. Never the same ones either. They come and go.I had a good time tonight, but next time, let's have some real fun.Good night, Max.Hello... Big night?I would hope so.Oh, of course.Hey, that's my new major. I got so sick of Soc.Well, there's a great local band playing the Pub. You should come.Great. I'll see you there.Hey!They're Anhedonia. They're \"sludge-core.\"That's their trademark. They insult the crowd at the end of the set. Sometimes he breaks the mike two songs in. We were lucky: they played for almost 40 minutes.Look, the mike's not even broken. They were just tired of playing, but they wanted to give us something to remember. Now that's showmanship.It worked for The Who.Ha ha. Come on, is that the kind of a joke a celebrity DJ would make?You're a riot. Let's get out of here.Oh, Mark. He's been following me around for years. He's easily threatened.Don't worry about him, he isn't a threat. You're far more interesting.You're not fooling me, you know. I can see right through this aloof image.It's not an insult. I get the sense that there's this whole other side of your personality.See, this is the side you show, playing everything off as a joke whenever things gets serious. But there's more to you.Quick. Now. Tell me something about yourself, something I never would have guessed. And don't even try to come up with some witty retort.I should get going.I said something I never would have guessed.Sorry. That wasn't quite what I was looking for.Let's see. Okay, here's one: I have a boyfriend.Okay, well, not anymore. Eric and I were together in high school, but we broke up over break.Yeah. He's kind of a jerk. It was all a waste of time. Sometimes I, I, I don't know, Max, why don't you have a girlfriend?That's crazy.And it has a very positive message, too. I wish more guys were into it.You don't know what I'm wishing for.Max, there are a lot of girls that would go for a guy like you.This is one of those moments, in a movie, when a character has a chance to say something, and of course they do, and it's perfect, and it becomes a movie moment.Are you hungry at all?Sounds perfect.Ernest Borgnine? Yeah, I noticed that too.That's a scary gift. I mean, even if people are destined to break up, the will to stay together is very powerful.I don't know if your gift is really that special, Max. I mean, we break up with everyone we ever date... Until the one we stay with forever.How did you get this attitude if you love Annie Hall?Actually, it's stuck on it. It's how I first heard your show.It doesn't matter, Max. Now that I've met you, your show's not important.This is a nice place. Ritzy. Interesting mix of people here, you've got these men with their suits, taking their waitress girlfriends out to impress them into bed, because they can't get them any other way. Really, as if a fast car can ever make up for a small dick.Guys, always obsessed with dick size.Let's guess which couples are destined to break up. How about them?Hi! Do you have a boyfriend?What do you need to know?Describe him for us. It's okay, I'm a psyche major.We're not ready, thanks.Max here thinks you're going to break up with your boyfriend.Hey! Don't shoot the messenger!Hey, we're all people here, right? If you want to talk to someone, talk to them. I don't spend my time trying to justify talking to people or whatever. You limit yourself if you do that. If you spend too much time worrying, you don't spend enough time living, right?You have to keep yourself open to possibilities in life. I'm the first one in my family to go to college. Sometimes I can't believe I'm here, at a semi- prestigious university getting a halfway- decent education-- this has always been my dream. How did you end up here?I know what you mean, financial aid is a bitch. And the university experience itself is kind of disappointing. All those rich students with no idea how lucky they are. But I don't think about them. I think about me, I think about where I want to be someday: a world traveler, running some huge company, or, you know, doing some fantastically important work. And when the day comes that I can relax, I'm going to charter a boat, sail around the world, and see the Seven Wonders.Come on, aren't you curious about the world? Doesn't the sheer scope of life fill you with wonder?Ah, Max...Max! What are you doing here?Judy, Mark has the tattoo. This is Max.Yeah, isn't he great?What a surprise! What brings you here?It was excellent, how was yours?Yeah? Anyone I know?Really?For lunch?It is, but I saw it a couple of weeks ago. I don't think I can sit through it again. You mentioned something about Annie Hall the other night. Do you have that lying around?Isn't that it on the end there?Sure it is.No, it isn't.You don't believe your friend's theory, right?Because it's insulting. A cop-out.Oh, good idea. But next time, Annie Hall.What are you\u00ad?Why did you back away?It wasn't me, I wouldn't have backed away.Ow.No, it's okay.It's okay. Shut up already.Nice to meet you guys, but I was just leaving.I have work to do before class tomorrow.Sure, all right. Boys, nice to meet you.I wish I had a cigarette.Me too. It's strangely sexy when guys smoke.So. You and Beth are pretty close, huh?She really cares about you.It's great that you're still friends.Sometimes this place annoys me. There's so much bullshit. My semester off was the right idea. What happened to old- fashioned hard work?Why not just set your tuition on fire?So, get on up, lazy.How can you be shy, after, you know...?You have a problem with nudity.It's too easy.A double-shift, I get out at five. This week's gonna suck. I have homework that can't be avoided.Nice try, Max. I thought you had homework and stuff, you liar. Great song, by the way.Come on, you're funny, you have good taste in music...I don't know.I'm just calling to say that you left your underpants and took mine.My radio days are over, I'm now deaf.You were only playing music.Wow... You're a real piece of work, you know that, Max?This has been some crazy week. I still have a six page paper due Monday.Don't worry about it, I needed a break. Good to get out and enjoy the weather.No.I'm from northern Vermont. Not too far from Canada.It sucked but I managed. Read a lot. Had a few close friends. That's all you need. It's quiet up there, dull but nice.Will you relax? I know how to drive.I've got it under control, Max!Oh, yeah?Did you just call me your girlfriend?Ah well, I guess that's alright. Boyfriend.Something that pays the bills.Now I know where you get it from.Yes, I'm Psych now. I didn't like Soc.Oh sorry, I just meant, I needed something more, ya know, relevant.Well, look, I'm only in college for the degree. Most of the stuff they teach us is pointless anyway.Yeah, it's about avoiding the real world for as long as possible.You call theater the real world?Look, my parents worked their whole lives to give me the opportunity to be here. But the truth is, private schools like ours make money by showing students a good time for four years. It's bullshit.That's not what I--God. What a bunch of spoiled, whiny college brats.No, it's okay. I just need a few hours to work.Okay, see you later.Hey. Sorry I'm late. You wouldn't believe what cross-campus traffic was like.No, you've got something here that I've been looking forward to all week.You must face your fears. Relax, it's a very positive film. You just have to know how to look at it. It's really refreshingly positive.You know, I think I prefer Manhattan.It's just deeper, more sophisticated, I guess. Listen, thanks for dinner and the movie tonight, but I should get going.I don't know if this is a good idea right now.Listen, since the other night, I've been doing some thinking...I don't think that this is a good time for us to jump, or leap, or whatever, you know, together. Into a relationship.Did we?Well, you're right, Max, and this relationship was worth it.Are you okay? Will you please calm down? I like you very much, but I told you, I just got out of a serious relationship, and it ended really badly. We saw each other almost every day at the beginning, but by the end of the semester, I hadn't seen him in a month. He stopped returning my calls and stuff, and I mean, he basically avoided me, then I heard he was seeing one of my friends.It's nobody's fault, I know. I mean, I've been trying but it's hard. Relationships are very difficult to maintain. There are so few successful couples.My parents are divorced.Max, I did, believe me.I don't know what I was doing. I didn't think about where this might lead until it was too late.Say something. Are you okay?Jesus, Max. It's not an anti-relationship movie.You're not listening to me, Max. Just like you're not listening to Annie. No matter what you think right now, this was worth it. Because I got to meet you, and got to be close to you.", "clean_line": "sorry interrupt thought heard max oh great hoped wanted heard radio week thought great thoughtful poignant funny know look like
