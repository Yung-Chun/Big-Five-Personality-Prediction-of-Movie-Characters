{"Spare-Me": {"THEO": {"raw_line": "When you hear thunder......God is bowling.I'm from Akron.I'm looking for a man.A bowler.I'm not here to bowl.I'm looking for somebody.I'm looking for Buzz Fazeli.Some unfinished business.You guys got something going on downstairs?Basement bingo?Let go of my bag.I said, let go of my bag.Tell your little pal to let go.Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?It belonged to my dad.Is Mr. Fazeli in please?I'm a bowler.Theo.I'm not on the tour this year.Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.They suspended me.It wasn't really my fault.They suspended me for 100 years.I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.My mom was there. She told me about it. The 'Fazeli Split.'Thanks.It's mine.Grace Skinner.She's my mom.I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.Grace Skinner Fazeli, you must remember her?You knew her. You married her in 1963.I got a right. You're my father.99 years, 241 days, 15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling. Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down.Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.Maybe I should have left the ball in the car.I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.He's my father, Millie.Where can I find him?Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?She thinks someone's trying to kill you.Theo.What's your specialty?Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.Uh...over easy.Putt-putt golf?The small ball.Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.Maybe I could bowl in Japan.I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.He's my dad.I'm coming with you.Do those two work for your dad or mine?Do you know where they're taking him?Get your hands off me, you moron.What the fuck is this?It looks like dwarf bowling.Dwarf bowling's illegal.You said it would be unethical to help me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.I'm your blood.You knew she was pregnant.Don't say that about my mom!Fuck you and fuck bowling.I don't need the stinking pro-tour.Hello.I'm not here to - I can't...I came here to have a word with your dad.Business.Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.You know who I am?You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?It's very...clean.That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.And the dwarf bowling?Nice set-up.What if he wants to get out?What ever happened to just bowling?I like the sport the way it is.How Mr. Kastle?Why would you help me?I could do that.This is a vicious cycle.Isn't this technically a scooter?Kinda tough on the butt.Where did your brother escape from?What does he do?Whoa.No thanks, I don't hookah.Don't tell me, John.Theo. Howzitgoin.How's that?Uh...over easy.So, you're the pinman around here?No, not at all.The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.I'd rather you didn't.Not while I'm in training.No. Do You?So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?Unfortunately what he wants is you.Do I want you?I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.No, I'm fascinated.I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.Well, that was plan A.Plan B is your dad.He said he'd sponsor me.Nothing.He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.Sheila, please.What's plan C?Look, Sheila, I really like you but... Sheila rolls on top of him, and plants a hickey on his neck.Forget it, Sheila.I'm getting to like it here.I gotta survive.You got a better offer?I didn't think so.That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.I couldn't care less.Really? I kinda like it.It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.So why do you stay?I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.More than you could afford.I could let them go for ten.If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.What are you going to do about your brother?What about the guy he put in the body cast?Then it's true, isn't it? About...I don't like to talk about it.It depends.You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.Nope, I couldn't care less.Why should I help that old fuck.Zip.Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history. Too late for what?Too late for what, Sheila?You got any broken bones?Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.Why not?Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.It's Junior, isn't it.He's my father.I'll be at the bridge.Knock-knock.Buzz Fazeli.Who's there?No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.What did you do to Buzz?I don't want to play.Sheila! Where are you?You told Junior that we did it.It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.How do you get this thing down?You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?He's dead Sheila.You should.I didn't stop to take his pulse.I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.Buzz? You alright?Hello, mom?I found dad.Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.I gotta go. Love ya mom.The pin machine?Where's Junior?I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.At least I'll die smiling.Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.It's gonna be you, Sheila.Maybe you were right Buzz. Maybe I did just come here to take it out on somebody. But, I had to find my father... The muffled BEEPING of \"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head\" begins playing from inside the coffin. Theo's body jolts. He runs after Sheila who is walking towards her scooter.Buzz is alive, Sheila.I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.SSHHEEIILLAAA!Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here.Who identified the body?I'm the next of kin. I should've seen him.You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?You're really pissing me off.My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?Fuck plan C!You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?Sez you!Paradise.Paradise. HmmmmNope.You have orange whips?No. I'm from Akron.Hi Dad.He says that to all his wives.The whole world thinks you're underground.It could just as easily have been me in that box.What about bowling?You're a scumbag.Nice knowing you, dad.I never saw you.I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.See ya 'round Maynard.I am a professional man.You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.I don't know.", "clean_line": "hear thunder god bowling akron looking man bowler bowl looking somebody looking buzz fazeli unfinished business guys got going downstairs basement bingo let bag said let bag tell little pal let buzz fazeli belonged dad mr fazeli bowler theo tour year mr fazeli bowling congress says thorn suspended wasn fault suspended years appeal hoping help mr fazeli need sponsor sanction card come king ve orange whips akron remember finals akron seven split final frame thousand pegged toughest shot frame mom told fazeli split thanks grace skinner mom son hard father grace skinner fazeli remember knew married got right father years days hours minutes bowling alfie shuffles self serve island begins wiping yeah good wasn man thought theo trying affix lid cup hands trembling spilling coffee maybe left ball car sorry zeus millie couldn kill buzz need help theo helps millie load suitcases trunk car father millie millie left stay sister ronkonkoma lanes dangerous buzz thinks trying kill theo specialty ll number finest whips uh easy putt putt golf small ball miniature golf pansies maybe bowl japan know buzz fazeli dad coming work dad know taking hands moron fuck looks like dwarf bowling dwarf bowling illegal said unethical help dwarf bowling ethical right bowler buzz slaps theo face blood knew pregnant mom fuck fuck bowling need stinking pro tour hello came word dad business having legend dad isn cracked know shit list bad air mr kastle clean pinfall average ball flat needs work spin control dwarf bowling nice set wants happened bowling like sport way mr kastle help vicious cycle isn technically scooter kinda tough butt brother escape whoa thanks hookah tell john theo howzitgoin uh easy pinman ladies akron thigh ticklers training brother hazardous health dates unfortunately wants want know wanted fascinated kind wild bad boy bowling plan plan dad said sponsor asked eye couple days sheila plan look sheila like sheila rolls plants hickey neck forget sheila getting like gotta survive got better offer think right buzz know match frame needed spare crown stuck seven fazeli split beaten shot named dad moment passes theo turns climbs car looks buzz couldn care kinda like awhile want looking dad stay bet meet lot eligible bowlers pro bowler amateur man sheila moves closer theo afford let want professional man willing pay going brother guy body cast true isn like talk depends partner mr kastle sheila walks sleazeballs car pulls driveway nope couldn care help old fuck zip way late buzz fazeli history late late sheila got broken bones fucking sheila gonna happen buzz sheila trying tell theo unable tell sheila afraid sheila shakes head junior isn father ll bridge knock knock buzz fazeli junior shouldn touch dad tell buzz theo scrambles lane hands knees junior catches grabbing ankles buzz want play sheila told junior bouncy bouncy fucked tried squeeze fucking head reach stop sheila weigh answer hell sheila haven gotten naked oh great tried kill knew thought fooled thing wanted kill dead sheila stop pulse think brother gotten buzz gets car dirty work sheila fuck theo drives away leaving sheila standing watches car recede thoughtful expression turns heel buzz alright hello mom dad mom know little late gotta love ya mom pin machine junior ve pegged guys bowling dicks day buzz stooling guys sheila think bowling theo takes sheila arms kisses passionately stops looks nervously killed ll kill ll die smiling plan gonna plan bodies throb grind sandy hands sliding sweaty skin gonna sheila maybe right buzz maybe come somebody father muffled beeping raindrops falling head begins playing inside coffin theo body jolts runs sheila walking scooter buzz alive sheila come far bury guy dad owes sshheeiillaaa junior watch coffin stinks identified body kin ve seen tried look like junior trashed place junior underground coffin dicks faked dad murder theo chases sid breeze car catches sid grabs middle fingers right hand sid howls makes think know ultimatum huh pissing word good ll good word fuck plan think dumping bowling dumping sez paradise paradise hmmmmnope orange whips akron hi dad says wives world thinks underground easily box bowling scumbag nice knowing dad saw goin straight short cuts theo gets car buzz leans open window ya round maynard professional man bet bucks ll throw tongue know"}, "SHEILA": {"raw_line": "How's that orange whip comin'?Cup of joe Mr. Fazeli?You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.You look like you're something on the lanes.Oh, a professional man. What'll you have?Whips...orange whips.How do you want it? The eggs.Coming right up.Mine, and they never tip.Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.Luna, that's the guy. I saw him do this spooky bowling rain dance on the bridge.Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.Bowling block.What do you want with my dad?Won't your father help you with that?Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person. Better than any sex I've ever had.Everything has it's drawbacks.The mental hospital.He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...It's a vicious cycle.These guys all work at the alley, too. This is John, Susan, Jon, Suzanne, Jonathan, and Sue. Everyone welcomes Theo and Sheila.Mind if I cut in?You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.Can I ask you something personal?Do you have a girlfriend?Do you have a boyfriend?No. Not at the present.Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.So, what about you?We'll get into that later.Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.Why were you suspended?So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?What's plan B?What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?Ha! And what do you have to do for him?Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.What? Be my body guard? Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.Come on Theo, what about plan C?Plan C... ...is me.I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.Do you talk with your mom?My mom told me not to stay in this town.I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.How much would you charge me for the lips?Come on, bargain with me.You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.You're here.Momentary relapse. Except for that, he's been making progress. Sheila laughs. Theo nervously pulls his collar up over the hickey on his neck.Junior is like a faithful doggy. He loves his birthday so much, that every year, before we can go pick him up......he breaks out of the hospital and comes home on his own. Here they come. She hands the binoculars to Theo, who immediately trains them on the road.My mom once had an affair. When my dad found out, he had Junior kill the man. The body was never found, but I think Junior took him to the alley. Theo lowers the binoculars and looks at Sheila....lane six. Yes.Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.After we eat, Dad.Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!Leave him alone!Who's there?Junior who?You still got the touch Junior.It won't come true, Junior.Don't go near the bowling alley.It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.Nothing.You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.I can't tell you, Theo.I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.I'm afraid you'll hurt him.I can't - I can't do it. He's my brother.These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron, or anywhere else.It?I told him you were my boyfriend.We would have sooner or later.Did you - kill him?Tell me what happened Theo.If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.I feel sick.Are you sure he's dead?Where are you going?Can I come with you?Once my father walked in on me while I was making Barbie and Ken do it. He freaked. I was seven. He took all my dolls away from me and cut them in half. He gave the top halves back tome. Then he made me watch him burn the bottom halves in the fireplace. Theo kneels down nearby and throws a Barbie onto the bonfire. It goes up with a WHOOSH.I can see Junior's face in the fire.Why did you come back?If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.You don't get two chances with Junior.And you only get two chances with me.What's it gonna be, Theo?What's the plan, Theo?Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.Theo, Buzz is dead.Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?What about plan C?Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.Suck my dick!Very professional.Lips still for sale?Can you change something this big?You'll owe me.", "clean_line": "orange whip comin cup joe mr fazeli need coffee mr fazeli need vacation sheila catches sight theo pulling parking lot puts ken head earring right ear buzz follows sheila gaze buzz burger cues haven introduced fan look like lanes oh professional man ll whips orange whips want eggs coming right tip yeah babylon buzz runs lanes dad everybody bowling town answers dad theo splits luna guy saw spooky bowling rain dance bridge theo fazeli specialty seven split theo looks lane sees pins standing bowling block want dad won father help dad nice people fucking town dad slime kastle walks theo stands shakes kastle proffered hand think motorbike free things people bike feel like wild person better sex ve drawbacks mental hospital follows tries sex send nut hut gets follows tries sex send nut hut vicious cycle guys work alley john susan jon suzanne jonathan sue welcomes theo sheila mind cut sideburns talk party theo ask personal girlfriend boyfriend present town understands junior went family sessions realized sanest family actually fucking town knows exactly wants ll later theo couldn bowl wanted motocross champion folks care junior blew fuse hope girls ballet stuffed throats got bowling understood seriously hope insulting suspended hoping buzz instated plan think dad gonna ha oh dad body guard body theo guard dad sake career sheila starts unbutton bowling shirt come theo plan plan think new outfit suits theo talk mom mom told stay town credit card junkie went binge dad bailed trapped easy payment plan yeah little wannabes looking professional man charge lips come bargain professional men drive hard bargain afraid sheila pulls dollar momentary relapse making progress sheila laughs theo nervously pulls collar hickey neck junior like faithful doggy loves birthday year pick breaks hospital comes home come hands binoculars theo immediately trains road mom affair dad junior kill man body think junior took alley theo lowers binoculars looks sheila lane yes dad ridiculous open eat dad hooks guy interested mom ran away control theo deviant purposes leave junior got touch junior won come true junior near bowling alley wouldn bother buzz danger sure wouldn care needed help right yeah buzz fazeli probably late know people broken bones know storm coming gonna blow town feel tell theo saw eyes hit guy ball tv thunder rumbles theo takes sheila shoulders afraid ll hurt brother open door let catch machines trapped ll meet bridge theo takes keys sheila grabs arm cut akron told boyfriend sooner later kill tell happened theo dead ll coming feel sick sure dead going come father walked making barbie ken freaked seven took dolls away cut half gave halves tome watch burn halves fireplace theo kneels nearby throws barbie bonfire goes whoosh junior face come junior finds ll kill chances junior chances gonna theo plan theo theo doll legs catch theo stares sheila eyes theo buzz dead plan vicious cycle theo lets sheila ve trapped miles kastle life walks scooter mounts locked free gotta start revs peals said ultimatum want father shovel start digging hurry probably purgatory sheila makes pathetic attempt speed away theo moves pissing said hell word plan word good gonna dumping suspending suck dick professional lips sale change big ll owe"}}}
