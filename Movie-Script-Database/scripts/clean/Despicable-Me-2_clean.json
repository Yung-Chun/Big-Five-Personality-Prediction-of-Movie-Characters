They hardly know each other!No, no, I am--Yes, but there has been a new development, and I'm telling you, this is the guy. You need to arrest him immediately. And his deviously charming son. I'm pretty sure that the son is involved, too. The son also. You've got to get the son.I think that the son is the mastermind. There's a look. There's a devilish look in his eyes and I don't like it!Evidence schmevidence! I go with my gut, and my gut tells me that this guy is El Macho! Lock him up! Lock up the son.
