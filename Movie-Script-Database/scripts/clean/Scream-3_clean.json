{"Scream-3": {"GALE": {"raw_line": "Good morning Hollywood. And today officially starts the Summer movie season. Opening the box office this week is Jeff Bridges and Tim Robins in Arlington Street, Eugene Levy and Jason Biggs in American Pastry, and Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer in STAB 2, based off my best selling book the WINDSOR MURDERS.Well I see a lot of the audience has dressed to the occasion. Today we have director of the upcoming STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO, Roman Bridger. Why don't we give Mr. Bridger a nice welcome to the set of Total Entertainment.It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way. Honestly though, tell us, what's your favorite scary movie?Your life?Would you excuse me for a moment?Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?A note?That's Sidney Prescott's mother.I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.D\u00e9jr vu-do.Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.Show him.Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.Oh come on! Why the hostility?They're the ones who approved it.Alright Kincaid, no where to?Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.Shit. Can I even get a ride home?Shit. Sarah Darling. I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?Who?But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.Please, call me Gale.Wait a minute, Roman's your suspect?Hey, fuck off.So, what now?Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it or not it looks like we're going to have to go back into our past.This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.! What about you?You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!' But now you're here. Not with me. Dewey, I took care of you. I waited until you were well. I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.It was fucking '60 Minutes II'! I couldn't say no! I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!It didn't work Dewey. We tried, we're different.Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?All of what Dewey? You do know something, don't you?Always.And?Someone stole Sid's file?I'm sorry, this is too good!Right. Sorry. Do you think he did it?And who is that?Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?I happen to work for the police god dammit!Neither are you, Magnum P.I.Fuck!Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?AND I DIE NAKED?! UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?Still that was a much better movie, I saw it at the premiere last week. God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business.I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.Oh use your brain drama queen! Do the killers ever knock on the fucking door? Ever see Jason do that before burying an axe in some big titted blonde's head? Or maybe Michael or Chucky? Huh?Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!Who's phone?Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!What?Come on!But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher. I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!Four? There are five.OK, look. We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'. What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later? The issue is Maureen Prescott!Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what? Hey.Thank you.What'd he say?Do you have her number stored in your memory? Phone memory!Has anyone else every used your phone?Who's this.I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.I work better alone. Why don't you do some snooping around the set?What the hell are you doing?I am Gale Weathers!None.And as a sane person. For you that must be quite a stretch.Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.No really?Possibly.Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?It may be Maureen Reynolds --What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?Dew!Sidney, what happened?We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.She was an actress Sidney. Minor B-Movies. But now we have a new suspect in this twisted fucking web . . . John Milton.It makes sense doesn't it? It's his big grandiose swan song from the genre. What a better way to end than with a bloodbath?Dewey, Jennifer, I think we should pay John Milton a little visit.Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?Nobody said she was an actor.Settle down Beavis. Why don't you tell us the truth?And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?Just because you knew her?I don't think so! Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.Are you saying she was-Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies. His two hands, dingus.Oh Dewey I'm sorry.Here. Let me --Shit. That's gonna leave a mark.Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.Dewey!He killed Milton! The killer's inside there! Oh God! DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!Awfully late time to be doing an interview.Sidney, stay away!Dewey! No!Oh God! Oh God!Christ Sidney hurry up! That fucking lunatic is coming!I know! He killed Kincaid!Let's get out of here!Jesus Christ Sidney get out of here! He can't get us both!RUNNN!Hey bitch, don't ever use prop cuffs to restrain Gale Weathers.I know all the tricks!THIS IS FOR THE STARDOM I NEVER HAD! BITCH!WHOA! HOLY SHIT IS THIS GONNA MAKE A GOOD BOOK!Sure, why not.

Sid doesn't need you Gale.I promised Sid I'd keep her in seclusion. I promised her nobody would ever find her. If you don't mind Detective, I'd like to approach her with this on my own and see what she'd like to do about it.Understood. If you'll excuse me Detective.

L.A Forever?What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!You used to say that was our strength.Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.Off the record.Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'. She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.The boys said no. She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.I already removed it. I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?I've got my suspicions but still, nothing you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.Jennifer needs me.I'm on duty.Stop following me.You're not a detective.Gale, your engine's still running.What about Sidney?Ssh.

Yeah, I guess I do.Just Jennifer. And you.I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know, trick you out of hiding.Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices.
