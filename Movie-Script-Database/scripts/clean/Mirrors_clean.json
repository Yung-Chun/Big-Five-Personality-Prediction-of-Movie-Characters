{"Mirrors": {"BEN": {"raw_line": "Almost 8:30... Coffee?Go back to sleep... I'll call you, OK?See you later, Angie.I just got here.Thanks Larry.No, not yet.No, I'm staying at my sister's, in Queens.She's a bartender.You know what I want. I'm ready to come back, I'm feeling much better now.Larry, I'm telling you, I'm ready.What?! Come on Larry, a security guard job... I'm not ready to retire yet!I do. The one that burned down?Yeah, in a couple months... I gave everything for the NYPD. I almost died out there. Everyone seems to have forgotten that.Amy, it's me... I just wanted to let you know that I got a job today... It's nothing special, just a security guard job... If you still want to go ahead with it, we can sign the divorce papers... I mean, if that's what you really want. I've been thinking about Michael's birthday tomorrow. It would be nice if we could celebrate it together ... You know, for the kids' sake... Call me... Please.Did you clean them?The mirrors, why are they so clean?Why did he leave?Almost a year.I was wounded during a holdup... It kind of changed my perspective on things.How old are you, Lorenzo?I do now.I think your grandpa just wants to scare you a little.See you tomorrow.Fuck...Well I don't know, I just found this package hidden behind a tree.Maybe... Daisy, has Michael been a good boy? Does he deserve his birthday present?Is mom back?Hello Rosa!I'm good, very good... What time will Amy be back?OK, I'll wait for her.No, thank you. I'll be fine.Happy birthday, Michael.Hey Amy...Ok kids, it's time for your bath. No fooling around.I do, but you never take my calls!I haven't had a drink in three months but, then again, how would you know?You don't think people can change?Just give me another chance.WHAT RULES?! IT'S MY SON'S FUCKING BIRTHDAY TODAY! COME ON AMY, WHAT RULE IS GOING TO STOP ME FROM SEEING HIM?I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell at you... Things could be so different between us.Yeah... Anyway, I wasn't planning on staying. My shift starts in an hour. I'll just kiss them goodbye and then I'm leaving.I haven't managed to find the source of the leak. My guess is it doesn't come from the store... It must be a municipal pipe that blew with the cold...Nothing special...You can't avoid them. They're everywhere...The mirrors... In the department store, at every street corner, in the windows of every fucking building in this city. I feel like I'm not the one looking into the mirrors, but rather they're looking at me.No, I'm serious.Gary?Gary?Coming...What happened?Did they mention the cause of death?Have a good night, Lorenzo.Damn... What is happening to me?Amy, I need you to do me a favor...I need your help... It won't take more than twenty minutes. Please, Amy?You picked up this guy yesterday morning... I need to take a look at him. It's very important.He used to work at the Mayflower as a night watchman, before I replaced him.I found his wallet in the department store. I need to find out how he died...He sent me a package before he died, with newspaper articles about the Mayflower... I think he was trying to tell me something... I don't know him. I've never even met him, Amy... I need to figure this out.You know a lot of people who cut their own throats?How... What did he slit his throat with?I need to see his files...I NEED TO SEE HIS FILES!I won't leave until I see that file.Look at this picture... Come and see, Amy.Look...Look at the piece of mirror in his hand. In the reflection of the mirror it's covered in blood, and look- in reality, it's clean. Not a drop of blood...Don't you find it strange that this mirror doesn't reflect an exact image of reality?What if the mirrors were showing us something different?What if the mirrors were reflecting something that goes beyond reality?Thanks for your help...Please, not you...I made a deal, Angie... I can't just walk out on them like that. I need this job, I need the money. I'm not going to sleep on your couch for the rest of my life!LEAVE ME ALONE...Mrs. Lewis... Sorry to bother you... My name is Ben Carson. I worked with Gary, at Mayflower. Could I come up and talk to you for a few minutes?Mrs. Lewis ?Did he use any drugs?Did you notice anything different, the days prior to his leaving the house, anything unusual in his behavior?What kind of changes?Sleeping?Busy doing what?Is that you standing next to him?Mrs. Lewis, I found a note that Gary wrote.A piece of paper, where he'd scribbled down the name, Esseker... Does that mean anything to you?May I see his room?Do you mind if I stay in here for a moment?WHERE ARE YOU?!!STAY CALM... I'M COMING!I'm here Ma'am...Ma'am? I'm right he...Sorry I'm calling you this late. Were you sleeping?Don't worry, everything's OK.Actually, no. I think maybe I'm losing my mind.You were right about the Mayflower... I'll quit tomorrow.No, I'll wait till the daytime guy gets here to tell him.Yeah, sure. See you later, Angie.Love you too, sis.No, I don't want to put them in any danger.I've got things I need to deal with.She asked me to quit and they got to her...I know who did this Amy.They wouldn't believe me and neither would you... Goodbye.Why did you do it? WHY? WHY DID YOU HAVE TO KILL HER?What is it you want? What do you want from me? ANSWER ME! WHAT IS IT YOU WANT?!...Look up Esseker... Yes, Echo, Sierra, Sierra, Echo, Kilo, Echo, Romeo... Esseker. No idea, my guess is that it's a name... No, I haven't got a first name. Yes, in New York. Over the past five or six years. I know it's hazy but that's all I've got. I already looked it up in the phone book. I also called someone at the IRS and at the DMV, but nothing there. It's very important Larry. You'll call me back? Ok...Yes, so, what'd you find out? Nothing under that name? Shit, shit, shit, shit... Can you look up Berry, Terrence Berry......Got anything? Great...No, I already know all that. Is he still alive? No... Can you find out where he was committed before his death? Wait, I'm writing it down......Roosevelt Psychiatric Detention Center... Yeah, I know where it is. Thanks.Did you consider Terrence innocent?Amy... I have to go.Don't worry, there's nothing wrong. Everything is OK...I'm doing it to protect you.Look Amy, you've got to trust me, I know what I'm doing... It's for your own good.You have to trust me Amy, I'm not completely crazy... These mirrors are dangerous. At first, I thought it was only the ones at the store, but now I know they can get you anywhere. They got Angela... I promise I'll leave the house once I've taken them all down.Come Amy, come with me, I want to show you something.Look, you'll see...Wait, look, you'll see...But... I swear to you I... I saw...Amy...Hello, Larry? It's me... I'm going to need your help again-Mayflower used to be a hospital before it became a department store. St. John's Hospital. Do you have any idea where all the medical records could have ended up after it closed down?Go to the city hall archives... They must have something considering it was a public hospital.Larry, Larry stop it... If I could go myself, I wouldn't be asking you. Go to the City Hall archives, and ask them to look up Esseker among the former patients. Please.Please, do it for me.Talk to you later.What have I done? I don't understand... What have I done?Perfect, Larry. That's perfect.I don't know exactly. I can't tell you, but some really fucked up things started happening to me when I took the job over there. Nothing makes any sense to me either but I have to follow my instinct.Anna Esseker... Where did you find her files? Did you go to City Hall?What?What about the doctor? Dr. Kane?You're still alive, aren't you?You're wrong Larry, you're wrong......she left the hospital on the 4th.Amy ? What's wrong?What?What's happening?Where are Daisy and Michael? Are the kids all right?Get out of the house. I'll be right over...I'm right here, Amy. I'm here now... Thank god you're alright.Anyplace is gonna have mirrors or windows... Anything you can see your self in is dangerous. We have to make the house safe. The only way is to cover all the reflections. If we keep them in the dark we can avoid them. We need paint, we need tape...As quickly as I can, sweetheart. I promise.They want her, I'm gonna find her wherever she is. We don't have any other choice.I'm sorry about everything I've put you through... I didn't want to...Amy, I want you to stay here with the kids until all this is over. All the mirrors are covered, there's no more danger. I'll come back as soon as I can.Hey baby, everything's gonna be fine. I love you.Hello... Is this the Esseker farmhouse?I am looking for Anna, Anna Esseker.I huh... I am doing some research for a book on the history of St. John's Hospital, in New York...And after the hospital?Anna left the hospital two days before the massacre. Kane changed the records to make her disappear.I want to know. After St. John's, where did she go?For a while?And after? Why did she leave?With Anna?With the mirrors?Mr. Esseker, tell me where I can find your sister. It's very important. It's a matter of life and death.Where is she now?Hello Sister. I have come to visit a member of your community... Sister Anna? Her real name is Anna Esseker.No, not really.Listen, Sister, I must see her.Please, tell her that I came all the way from New York and that I work with Dr. Kane at St. John's Hospital...My name is Benjamin Carson. I work as a night watchman at 1229 West 38th Street in New York City, what used to be St. John's Hospital.I need your help.My wife and children are in danger. What is threatening my family is asking for you...If you don't help me I may lose the only thing that matters to me.Tell me why are the mirrors from the old hospital so determined to find you?I must know, Sister.A window... For what? For whom?What truth?It entered with you and they need you to get out.Wait... Please, listen to me- Terence Berry, Gary Lewis and many others before me... Those are the people who died trying to find you. Because they failed, their families died too. My sister was murdered two days ago... My wife and kids will next if you don't come with me. Look-My wife and two children. They're all I've got. They're innocent... Please.I KNOW YOU ARE SCARED OF GOING BACK THERE. IT'S EASIER TO KEEP HIDING BUT THIS IS NOT THE HOUSE OF GOD ANYMORE. WHILE YOU'RE PRAYING PEOPLE ARE DYING ON YOUR TIME!What?Amy, what's going on? Are you alright?No Amy, stay with me...Where is Michael?Amy? Amy? Answer me?My kids are not going to die tonight. You're coming with me, now.You have my word.Answer! God damn it... Answer the phone...Fuck...Something's wrong over there, my wife is not answering.We have to get inside the Mayflower now.Come on, let's go.Watch your step, a water pipe has burst, the whole basement

...You have reached Amy Carson. I am not available to take your call. Please leave a message and I will get back to you as soon as I can.\"Hi Rosa... Where are the kids?It's great, you will have to show me how it works!Ben, can I talk to you, in private?What is this? I already asked you not to drop by without calling, didn't I?I don't need your calls in the middle of the night. I'm better off without them.I don't want to know, Ben. I don't want to hear about it. It's not my problem. You're not my problem. You've done more than enough harm already.We are not talking about people, we're talking about you. How many times did you tell me you were gonna change and nothing happened? It only got worse.I need more time, Ben. Listen, I will never stop you from seeing your children but we have to set up some rules.Look at yourself. You're still carrying around so much of that anger.Yes I know, but it's up to you Ben.Yes, honey.I don't know sweetheart. I don't know.Are you OK? What's happening? What are you doing here?Listen, I am in the middle of work, I don't really have time now.Why do you want to see him?Where did you get his driver's license?You are no longer a cop, Ben. This isn't your business anymore.There you go... There's your answer. Your man committed suicide.I've got to get back to work, Ben. They're waiting for me upstairs.Are you OK, Ben? What's going on?What?Come on, Ben, what is it you're after? I am not supposed to show you any file... You're not even allowed to be here. I could get fired for this.What is happening to you? What is all this supposed to mean? What is going on, Ben?What!?So what?I can't see the difference. It must be an effect of the angle from which the photograph was taken. What is it you are you trying to prove?What? For Christ's sake, listen to yourself, Ben! What are you talking about?OK... This is way over my head. I don't have time for your barfly theories.You should go home and get some rest. This guy probably just killed himself because he couldn't live with himself anymore. It happens to thousands of people, you know...What is it Michael?What is it? Did you have a bad dream?Where Michael?No, Michael... Look, there's nothing there.It was just a nightmare. It's late, you have to go back to sleep. I'll turn on the night-light, if you want.Sure sweetheart... OK, you two go to sleep now.He would never have laid a finger on her. When their father died, Ben took care of his sister. Angela meant the world to him.No, lately, communication hasn't quite been our strong point... I only found out yesterday that he was staying at his sister's. What are you going to do with him?You know what's gonna happen if you let him go. He won't stop here. I know him, he won't stop until he finds who did this to her.What kind of friend are you? You are using him. He's not a cop anymore.You have to see someone Ben. You cannot stay in this situation any longer. You need help, psychological support.Why don't you...if you want...come spend a few days at home, with the kids?What do you mean?Ben, look at me! I don't want you to get into any trouble. Think about Daisy and Michael. You are not going to solve this case. Please, stay out of it.What? Who are you talking about?In that case, you have to tell them everything.Ben, wait...Do you want the cereal in your hot chocolate or in a separate bowl?Michael?...In the chocolate, please, mom...Come on, come on, let's get going, or you're going to be late for school.What is it sweetheart?Really, what's his name?Does he go to your school?Very well. If you don't want to tell me about it...Why doesn't he want you to talk about him? Is he a grown up?So, he's a little boy your age, then?Does he live in our street? Is it one of our neighbors?Is it your father who told you that?Michael, answer me. Did your father talk to you about the mirrors?OK... Come on, come on guys, let's get our teeth brushed, and our coats on. The first one in the car is the winner.Do you mind telling me what the hell you're doing?Ben!I want you to stop what you're doing and get out of our house right now.You're scaring the kids acting like this.If you don't leave immediately, I'm going to call the police, Ben, and I warn you, you will never see your children again. Do you understand what I'm saying?Do you realize what you're saying, Ben? What is wrong with you? I know that what you're going through isn't easy. Angela was a part of our lives too, but you have no right to do this to us... Ever since your obsession with these damn mirrors the kids are scared to death. Your son has nightmares. He's scared Ben... Your behavior is starting to rub off on him. He's only 5 years old... And I have to protect him.What are you doing with that gun... Put it down, BEN... PUT IT DOWN RIGHT NOW!ARE YOU CRAZY BEN? HAVE YOU GONE COMPLETELY MAD?SEE WHAT, BEN?! WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SEE ?!Get out...now! I don't ever want to see you here again, Ben. And I'll have the lawyers make sure the same goes for the kids. You are insane, Ben, and dangerous... You've got to get help.Come on, come on... Let's go... Daisy, Michael?What are you doing Michael? Come on, we're going to be late.We can't stay here, we have to leave the house now... We can go to my mother's or to a hotel...What if you don't find her? Maybe she doesn't live there anymore? Maybe she's really dead.I know.Hello? Ben... Where are you? Did you find her? Did you talk to...Michael? MICHAEL!? Ben hold on, Michael is gone...I don't know, I fell asleep with the kids on the bed and...Michael?You stay right here sweetheart, I'm going to look for your brother. Stay right here. Ben, I have to call you back, I have to find Michael...Fuck! There is water everywhere... Michael? Michael? MICHAEL?!Ben, someone scraped all the mirrors... There is someone in the house.I don't know where he is. I don't see him. I...Damn it...Michael?Daisy... Daisy... Come here...Daisy... Daisy...Micha...Michael?! Michael?Daisy !?Daisy !Oh my god, don't move baby, don't move...Don't move sweetheart...It wasn't me Daisy, it wasn't me... I would never hurt you, you know that.I don't know where he is... I'm going to take care of you and then we're going to find him...OK But for now, we have to get out of here.Yes, he'll be here soon as he can.Listen to me carefully Daisy... I want you to stay in here and be quiet.You have to be brave, sweetheart... I want you to stay in here and not get out until I come back, no matter what happens. I'm going to find Michael... Do you hear me?I am so proud of you.Don't move...Michael ? Michael ?Michael !Michael ? What are you doing?Michael, I want you to drop that knife, do you hear me? You know very well you are not allowed to play with that, don't you?That's a good boy, now give me the knife...MICHAEL !Michael ?Michael ?Michael... Michael, look at me...
