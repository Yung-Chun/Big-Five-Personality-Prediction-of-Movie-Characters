{"Yes-Man": {"CARL": {"raw_line": "I'm here, aren't I?So I discovered b-school's not for me. People grow.Well, look, this sucks, but I understand where you're coming from.Of course I care. But I also understand.We're at different places in our lives. I get it.That would be inappropriate.C'mere. It'll be OK.Well, that was fantastic. Good night, guys.I saw the ball drop and hugged all of you. Aliens didn't invade. Our computers are still working. What else could possibly happen?I see that happen like every night. Good night and Happy New Year.I don't rock out.No thanks.No.Dear Trusted Foreigner, Allow me to introduce myself. I am the deposed King of Nigeria and I wish to propose a confidential transaction. Allow me to delete you, my liege.I'm not a soldier.I'm out of town.Sorry. Today I'm officially a greeter.Someone might come. And if I'm not here, they won't be greeted.Until I'm relieved as a greeter, my hands are tied.I'm Carl Kendall. Just a teller.Yeah, if you're into fake breasts and German engineering.No, but this gentleman can.Will do!No thanks.No.Can't.No.Sorry.No can do.Hello?I'm in bed. Why? What happened? Did someone die?It's already 11:15. I don't think I can make it.No.Alex Eberts? What's up, buddy?Where've you been? Norman's been heartbroken since you quit.Same old same old.You kidding? Every day it's impossible not to throw rocks at the place. Since you don't work here anymore, you want to throw a couple?What're you doing! Stop that! I was kidding!What are you doing here?What're you talking about?I'm sorry. I'm just really busy.So I don't want to go out tonight. Maybe I have to wake up early tomorrow. You don't know.What? So? I'm like a sexual camel. I only need it once every couple years.You wear a Rolex?So I don't have an oyster watch. All you and Lucy and Kath do is sit around and talk about real estate and Crate and Barrel.Forget Crate and Barrel. Maybe I'm just getting more mature. I don't need the lifestyle ever night.I hate meeting people.I am not a cave dweller. Just the other day, we all went to Summerfest and snuck backstage and you bet me I wouldn't steal something and so I stole a drumstick from that horrible Swedish hillbilly band. That's not very cave dweller of me.But that's not possible -- I was already working at the bank by then.I've been a teller at Southwest Bank for ten years? How the hell did that happen? Ten years... if I had had a child, he'd be toilet-trained by now.I was making out with chicks by fourth grade. I was a little man by fourth grade. Whatever. I don't need this shit right now. I'm an adult man. I can live my life as I see fit. Can you please leave?Uh, yeah. Have you been to this before?I don't know if I want that.Cool. Do you want anything from the refreshment area?That's OK. I'm just auditing.I'm cool right here.Carl.I wouldn't say that.It wasn't exactly my idea.Honestly?This whole thing seems retarded.I wouldn't necessarily --A little.It is.I'm not sure --Yes?Yello.Don't worry about it.Oh, thanks for the invite, but...Yes.Yes. I will come to brunch.Why?You kidding? I love brunch.Why do people wait an hour for breakfast? It's so hot and bright and we haven't even had coffee yet.Of course I want to be here. I love waiting an hour for eggs. It's fun. Although I will point out that you have sunglasses which is probably making this wait a lot easier.We were definitely before those Lowell people.Why does no one ever say anything?Yes. I will.Yes, we were.Well, this time the list lied.You all know that we were up before you! And you have to live with that knowledge through your delightful brunch!I just want transparency in terms of the brunch seating order.Yeah. We cool.I didn't realize you were looking to buy a place. I thought you and I would be renters to the end.Bacon and eggs.I don't want an adventure first thing in the morning.Yes.Yes.Yes.Yes.Yes.Yes.Yes.Yes.Yes.Coffee. And juice.Yes.Yes.Yes.Yes.I'm just addicted to the stuff. Chinese cultures say it's good for digestion. You're all welcome to have some.Yes.I don't think... there's any reason why I shouldn't? On a Saturday there's nothing I like more than the inside of a bank.Yes.All of them please.Of course I'll take a flier.Carl.Yeah. I just though it would be a fun way to lighten things up.I spent my own money on them...How may I help you?While loans aren't normally in my jurisdiction, I'd be happy to help you.Yes.Yup. What's your business?Adorable.Let me just get final approval on this.No, I know, so if you think this is a bad idea for a loan that's fine but can you please tell her yourself?Her business plan.That's silly. How're you supposed to start a tiny business if you can't get a tiny business loan?Do you maybe have any interest in borrowing ten thousand?Of course we can. One moment please.It's approved.Thanks, Marge. We don't like to make other customers jealous so can we keep this between you and I?That seems like a lot of responsibility.Grand?Next Saturday... sounds great.Wouldn't think of it.Believe it. Because this guy just got a promotion.Yes.Why not?Yes.Have a good day yuppifying your lives.Please don't leave me here with him.I have not been this drunk in years! The room is spinning in a bad way!Where's the class?Yes.Sign me up, bitch.Just tell me what you've got to say to me, I've been waiting for so long to hear the truth, It comes as no surprise at all you see, So cut the crap and tell me that we're through. Now I know your heart, I know your mind, You don't even know you're being unkind, So much for all your highbrow Marxist ways, Just use me up and then you walk away, Boy you can't play me that way.It depends -- is that your girlfriend?Then yes.Yes, I do. Very much.Yes, I am.I will.Me bringing it.You do not cross Carl Kendall.Yes.Your fiance?I thought you said you two weren't even dating?Hi... is there a Sanji Gupta staying here?I'm Carl. The guy from yesterday.No thanks. I just wanted to thank you for that inspiration.You know, just living every day to it's fullest. And, like, learning to continue to experience life or whatever.I just said I'm going to keep experiencing life. I thought you'd be happy.So what should I do?1) Until New Year's Eve, I must say yes. 2) The yes cannot distort the truth.3) If someone discovers you are a yes man, you do not have to say yes to them. 4) To avoid yes, you cannot avoid contact. Therefore, you must always answer your phone, the door, your postal mail, your email, etc and so on and so forth. 5) You must choose a yesponsor to keep you on the straight and narrow. Who should that be?5) I hereby void the \"do you want\" loophole. What is that?I say... yes.Is this like a legal document?AHHHHHHHH!Yesterday I got promoted and beat up and hooked up with this chick and I have a massive headache today and I still might throw up, but I don't care because it was the best time I've had in like forever. Not to mention finding out that, despite what you might think, smoked whitefish in an omelette is delicious, even if covered in a thick layer of pepper.You don't understand. I got promoted. Do you know how long I've been waiting for some kind of financial step forward? I said `yes' and it arrived.Excuse me for wanting an appliance in my kitchen besides a hot pot.That's where you come in. You're my \"Yesponsor.\"Like in AA. I need you to hold me to it.I look forward to proving you wrong.I'd be happy to.That's sexist. Please. I insist.Yes.Yes.Black coffee, large.To have a wonderful day? I would.What's the hurt in taking another?Of course. I couldn't say `no.'Dear deposed King of Nigeria. I would love to help you anyway I can with your confidential transaction. Please let me know what I can do. Yours, Carl Kendall.Yeah.Where did you hear that?I told her not to say anything.I might have some stuff to pawn./I will definitely check out your gun selection./I would like to learn Korean.(in Korean, withI disagree. I think you hit some pretty high octaves.I don't know -- I've known some water nymphs with big balls. From the high level of testosterone.\"Big Balled Water Nymph\"? It's a working title.Sure. I love clearing stages.So early? It's only 8:00?You're a photographer too?What time do you leave?Wow. I haven't seen the sunrise maybe ever. I guess now I'll be doing that tomorrow.Hey, Kath. Would you like one? I'm going to learn Swahili.Seb? What is that? Swedish?You're on a date then?He's very tall.Well, it was nice meeting you, Seb. So I'll be going.I'd love to. Join you guys.So, how did you guys meet?Oh, this is good. I was walking past Pizza Hut the other day, and for a second I was sure the sign said \"Pizza Hat.\" And then I thought, wouldn't it be funny if there was a shop that sold hats shaped like pizzas? You know. Because it sounds like \"Pizza Hut\" only it's a hat shop.Shit.Dear Omar, While I appreciate the gravity of your situation, perhaps a goodwill branch is in order. Could you perhaps loan me a million and take it out of my final cut? Then I will happily send you my bank details. Sincerely, Carl.Good morning.Well, it is five in the morning.I thought I'd use my phone.That's what I thought.As it was meeting you Farinoush.Will do. Should I call you?Farinoush Azzam. Great girl, but I don't think we're right for each other.PersianWifeFinder.com. Let's talk wedding shower.You kidding? I love stationery.Looks good to me.I'm just helping throw the shower.Look at this -- Bridal Bingo. What's Bridal Bingo?That sounds fun.How about a calendar shower?Do you even know what a calendar shower is? Maybe a calendar shower is awesome.I think that's really cute.You have got to do that. Like it's not even a choice.You only get married once.How much do you need?Done.You promise you'll pay it back?What am I doing?I'm sorry, but it's absurd that if you need a small amount of money you have to go to a loan shark. Only rich people can pay back loans over ten grand. A bank's job is not to just help the rich. It's to help anyone with a dream achieve it.Thank you so much.What do you need a loan for?Why don't you hire movers?Yes.Yes. Do you want to help at all?Where are you moving?[I like to drive with my mother.]I'm kind of in a rush...Well, that's really neat. So, thanks for the books and the jasmine tea and the vegan curry, but I have to go --It was really great meeting you --I really have to go.Yes.Do you have any candles? I just love candles.How about wine? Like a bottle of Beaujolais?I have herpes.Downstairs?It's a swinging door!I just adopted her. If you're interested, they're giving them away in front of Petco.Neither did I.Seems like a nice guy.He asked me to join them.I have no choice. I'm a yes man. I must say yes. If Seb asks me to join them on their date, I must. If some dude asks me for a loan I have to give it to them even if it's clearly never going to be paid back. If a guy asks me into his bedroom, I must hook up with him.It's like hooking up with a strong woman. I honestly don't see what the big deal is. I am guided by yes. Yes has become my superpower. And let me tell, yes is turning out to be a pretty sweet deal. Now if you'll excuse me I'm late for Korean class.That's no reason to write off an entire, vibrant culture. See you later, buddy.You really are displaying that.Wow. That's really big. How do you have time for all this stuff?You gave me the flier, so I had to go.Do you want to go out sometime?By the way, I do other stuff besides follow you around.I take Korean.I think I'm good. To have some more.Like, do you want to open a store?They're not terrible.I think you're being hard on yourself --When? Like in a couple years?People always talk about that, but you're actually doing it.It's lame, but you know, it's pretty funny. My boss Norman always throws theme parties.Because... it's actually not lame. I just gave the answer I've automatically given for years. I'm actually enjoying the bank for the first time maybe ever. I started this pilot program that gives out microloans.Like say you need three hundred bucks to pay for paint so you can start a house painting business. Rather than paying a loan shark who charges you 300%, now you can come to Southwest Bank. Whatever. It's kind of dorky.(in Korean, withFunny, not crazy. My boss is white noise.You know, like totally boring.I wouldn't bother.We don't have to stay long.I'm Carl. This is Renee.I don't think so.So, how do you know Norman?You're in a karate club?Khatoon, Norman! You guys should spar!I'm Carl. What do you do?Cool.It can't be that bad.So did you let him in?If you hate your job so much, why do you do it?You're a no man.I'm not supposed to tell anyone this except for my Yesponsor, but you can change your life. I've changed mine. If I tell you how, will you promise not to tell anyone?I say yes. To everything. Say Yes More. It's that simple.Nothing. Do you want to go?I just love pets. This is Veronica, King George, Owen, Carl jr., Carl the III, Carl IV, Bubbles, Greedo, Cat 1, Cat 2 and Cat 3. At the end there, I got kind of bored of naming them.You don't need to do that.I have a congenital heart thing it helps. And it's cheaper than the stuff that's made here.It's cheaper to buy in bulk. Is that a crime?Yes.I give great massages.How much does a Schwinn cost?Done and done.Really? Because I have a thing at one...I actually met you when I was just a teller.Thank you.Generous helpfulness?Uh huh.Janice Peabody's ant farm rental business.I've started a microloan project. I figure that if someone needs less than ten grand why should they go to a loan shark when they can come to a legitimate banking institution?No. I wouldn't do that.Thank you.Yes.Yes.I'm sorry -- bank meeting stuff.You have to have one. Modern Bride calls them a necessity.You know Peter. He's a man's man. He cares, he just doesn't know how to show it.You guys are perfect for each other.Maybe if you're just honest with him about how you're feeling it'll be OK.Sorry, the bank, you know? The UFO conference is tonight? No, that's fine, I'll definitely be there.Not necessary.For some reason, the bank keeps promoting me.Yes.Yes. I've got to run.What?Right. Of course.I just think if we're going to be rolling out a no interest financing campaign we should commit hard.I'm sorry I'm late.It was work, it went crazy late.Long story. Miss, could I have an orange juice? Like fast?Your wife found me a really great place. Built in Bose surround sound, a 100 inch LCD flat screen TV, roof deck with jacuzzi.Oh, this old thing? Prada, I think.You should check out her pottery. It's really big.Well, we're kind of in a celebratory mood.Maybe we should wait for Peter to decide.Why not? Let's celebrate.It's a really nice corner though.It's on me! I'd like to split it between an Advanta Blue Business, Mastercard, a Diners Club and my South Dakota Bank Visa Check card.I just spent $1500 on dinner.Because the waiter asked me if I wanted the expensive wine and you weren't there to stop me!No I can't. If I didn't say yes to the band flier, I never would have met Renee. If I hadn't said yes to taking charge of bank day care and then yes to becoming a loan specialist and then yes to the president's golf trip, I wouldn't be moving up. Each yes leads to the next one. If I stop, it could all fall apart.I don't know why I should be taking advice from a guy who's wife is pissed he's not involved at all with the wedding planning.You told her you don't care whether the invite's cream or ivory.What? Why?But you guys have dated for years.You're perfect for each other.She's terrified too.Of course she is. I think you'll both be a lot less terrified if you're terrified together.What matters is that you pretend you can see the difference.They're a little stiff.I'm actually going rollerblading with Ralph.You know, crazy rollerblading guitar man.Any interest?Yes.That is really good to know.Yes.I do this whole Habitat for Humanity Thing.(in Korean, withJust a little.Is it a problem if I've never played golf before?Metaphorically?I do.[I shall need the luck.

Two fifty but worth every penny.If you want to be sitting so bad, why don't you say something?What's going on with you?She's a fancy lawyer making bank. It's about time she was buying.What're you looking at?I don't think I've ever seen a waiter tap one of those pepper mills.Because you ordered a latte.A normal-sized beer is fine with me.We need a sofa, Carl. We're not buying a second home.For a whole year?But for a whole year?Well, someone sounds like they're yuppifying their life.There's no way you can do this for a whole year.Yesponsor?You aren't going to last for more than a week.Cavalli. Silk and cotton blend. Seven fifty.That's too bad. I'm sure someone will offer.Sorry, didn't bring my wallet.What's with the kitten?I don't want a kitten.Hey, asshole, we're not talking until you sign that goddamn contract.She was upset you went on her date.I think you're taking this too far.You hooked up with a dude?You hate Korean food.I likey your suit-ey. Hugo Boss?If you'll excuse me.Nice job with Renee. She's definitely odd, but that's not necessarily --What? Why?Don't get mad at me about it. You can just stop.You've gone from a passive guy who always said no to a passive guy who always says yes. Just saying yes is not a legitimate life philosophy.I'm involved.I can't see the difference. Honestly, I'm terrified.It's marriage, you know? The biggest thing ever.I know.I know.Really?But what if I really can't tell the difference between ivory and cream? Does that make me a bad husband?You own an apartment because of that job. People don't generally leave good jobs.Hey, honey. I think we should go with the tulips. I know roses are more romantic, but they're also much more clich\u00e9d. Babe, can you wait a second? I'm going to be on for a while. Ask your guru.

It's just brunch.It's a two bedroom duplex with harbor views. It'd be perfect for you Kath.That's... OK. Do you want a bite of mine?Congrats, Carl!I think I'm done actually.Well, it's been fun watching you guys recreate freshman year, but Peter and I have some furniture errands to run.It was good seeing you. You should come out more often.My girlfriends are being such bitches. It's been two weeks and no one's offered to throw me a wedding shower.Hey, you want to throw my wedding shower?I was kidding. Wedding showers are thrown by girls.Thanks. That means a lot to me.Who was that?How'd you meet?So, I know it's just a wedding shower, so who cares really? And it's like so lame? But I've made an appointment at a stationery store. Are you going to totally kill me?Ooooh, pretty. What do you think?Thanks for your opinion.I'm not marrying him.Nothing special. Just hors d'oeuvres and wine.I'm not doing Bridal Bingo.Can we concentrate at the task at hand?That's kind of cute.That seems a little extreme.You're really good at this. You mind helping me with the wedding invitations?What happened?I've never heard of a Wedding Shower cake.I'm sorry, it's just you've been so great at all this while my husband- to-be has been completely absent. Do you have time to grab a cup of tea?Is he scared to get married? Is that why he doesn't care?You know how to show it. A wedding is a huge deal. I'm so scared.I know that and yet I'm still so scared.He can be just so closed off.You've been so good to me. I've really come to depend on you. I want to pay you back.Peter tells me you might have some disposable income these days.If you want to look at some open houses, I'm happy to waive my fee.So this is at the very top end of what you could probably afford. Are you interested?Are you sure? I mean, this is the first place you've looked --I'm looking forward to meeting Renee tonight.We're all having dinner. Tonight. Remember?Least I could do. At least he's involved with our wedding.What do yo do for a living, Renee?Real estate broker.He doesn't know crap about wine. Just pick one, Carl.Do you rent or own?If you're ever interested in buying, you should ring me up.It's been hard to reach you.Everything OK?I was wondering when you want to meet with the florist.You're just stopping, just like that?He is helping.

Oh, it's you. Never mind.I knew after a year and a half of wearing you down, you'd give in. I'm Renee by the way.Carl. Cool. I like to thank everyone personally who comes to our performances. It gives it a nice intimate touch. See you soon Carl.Hey, give that back. You already took one.Destroys the Earth. Also, they cost me ten cents a copy. Besides, are you even going to come?See you tonight, Carl!Hello Jake, Penelope, Carl and Rodrigo. We are the Flying Buttresses!I don't think I hit a high enough octave in Fairy Dream Song.But I can hit like way higher. Like check this out. I think this tone might be more appropriate for my water nymph song?I've got to write a song about that. I could call it...I like it. I can work with that.I gotta clear. Unless of course, you want to help?Well, thanks for coming, Carl. I must bid good night.I lead a jogging, photo group for people who want to both exercise and practice photography.Amateur, but yeah. I show every Friday.Five. So we can see the sunrise.Oh, it's beautiful. Makes great photos. Nice meeting you, Carl.Wow. You look tired.Mammals are meant to be up at dawn. It's how we're built biologically. Where's your camera?Awesome idea. So light.Let's hit it.Alright! Enough standing around!That's probably my best photo ever. My collages aren't bad. But personally, I think I excel at pottery.How do you have time to come to every one of my rocks shows even the one in Fairfield county that was seventy-five miles from here? I almost skipped that one.At first I thought you were a weird stalker and I was scared. But now I think you're just a really shy dude with a crush. And while it's been suspenseful to see when/if you'd ask me out --Yes, I would.Like what?In that case, what do you say we do Korean?Do you want any more squid hot pot? It's really good here.What do you mean?Where I can sell my photos and pottery? Of course not. They're terrible.Yeah, they're awful.I'm not asking for sympathy. My voice is way too high-pitched, my pottery looks like poo, and my photos are blurry and subjectless. But who gives a shit? Not everything needs a goal. The world is a playground. You know that as a kid but then somewhere along the way everyone forgets.I bought a ticket for four months from now.Honestly, I'm terrified. How about you? Do you like the bank?So if it's lame why do you work there?What's that?That actually sounds really cool.So, what do you say we hit this crazy party?White noise?I don't know anyone who's totally boring. Crack a person's shell -- there's always something creepy underneath.What's going on?I currently don't have a television.It's a party. Let's socialize.Told ya there was something weird under that white noise shell.What did I miss?You work for the ASPCA?You have a lot of Mexican Viagra.You better not be a criminal. Because one time I dated this guy who jacked cars for a living and I did not enjoy living on the edge as much as I thought I would.A hundred boxes of Mexican prescription drugs borders on something vaguely criminal.No, you can't watch.You know what I would love? A massage.Oooh. Yeah. Oooh, right there.That's fine. It's only the very first time I've met your friends.What's with the \"They're Out There\" and \"I Gave\" button?You think? We went to three different Prada stores to find the right fit.I paint. I'm in a band. I do volunteer work at a shelter. I teach ESL. I do balloon animal art. You know, a little of this, a little of that.It is big. How about you guys?I sublet. I have this corner of a loft.I hate owning things. Because when you own something, you suddenly are invested in that thing not breaking. And I break everything. I've gone through three TVS in three years.I smashed one with a hammer, dropped one off my roof and the third one just went on the fritz. So I set it on fire.It was great meeting your friends.They are a little stiff. What do you feel like doing?Ralph?The guy who plays at the promenade?No. It's ten on a Friday night. And that guy's crazy. Don't you want to go home and make out?Just go.What's up, chicken butt?Congratulations!I was kidding. Not as sexy as it seems. It gets in like everywhere. What should we do to celebrate?How about Korean? Oh, no, you probably already had some today.You've just been so busy -- it'd be fun to have a night just the two of us. I wish we could just go to the airport and hop on the first flight outta here.I think we're going to London.Moscow, Russia, comrade.What was that?Maybe we shouldn't do this.Hey, who's your friend?It was nice meeting you.We're actually flying together.So, now that we're here, what should we do?It is?We don't have to do this.I think I might have whiplash from that tractor ride.Watch your back, Carl. I mean it. I'm very litigious.Would you... want to... travel around the world with me? I mean, I know we haven't really been seeing each other for that long, but I don't know...Yes?I think I'm falling, you know... Are you... ?Before our flight, what do you say we grab a couple Nebraskan steaks?I got US Weekly, Star and, for a little culture, the National Enquirer.They have movie reviews. What's in the package?I'm sorry, I have to go to the bathroom.What the hell is that?What the hell happened?So explain. Are you a drug smuggler?You expect me to believe a nice lady asked you to bring chocolates on a plane?I don't think you do.So you've just been saying yes to everything.Oh.I thought we had so much in common but if you just yes to everything I don't know that we do. How do I know if you even like Korean food?Do you even want to travel around the world at all or do you want to work at that bank and buy a lot of Prada suits?When I asked if you were falling for me all you said was yes.Yes.

I'm Chris Parker. The new president of Southwest Bank. Just wanted to come by and personally introduce myself to every branch manager.I was \"just a teller.\" And now I'm \"just president of the largest bank in the Southwest.\" You need anything, you let corporate know. You hear?Carl Kendall? I'm Chris Parker. President of Southwest Bank.(no recollection of it atBut then I got suspicious. What drives a man in his mid to late thirties who's still at the absolute lowest level of our corporate family? Generous helpfulness? Or raging revenge?Which is when I got the numbers from your loan desk.You've given out over 682 below minimum loans. One of them was literally for fifteen dollars and eighty seven cents.How do you explain yourself?Because the paperwork makes any profit moot. Unless you're raiding our coffers.I would if I could, so why wouldn't you?You're the kind of person we want in corporate. We're taking some clients on a golfing trip. You golf?You free tomorrow?Of course you are. I better watch my back around you, Carl Kendall. Soon you'll be taking my job. See you on the links.What happened to you?I love the concept of charity. It's awesome.You speak Korean?You sneaky devil. I knew I should watch my back around you.You're a funny one, Carl Kendall. Remember, they have to win. In Asian cultures, there's a concept called Saving Face. You have to let them win. But if they smell for a second that you haven't tried your hardest, they'll commit hari kari.Who knows? It's a delicate balance, Kendall. Like two little girls on a see saw with a crocodile beneath them. Make the wrong move, and the little girl will end up in the croc's maw.Alright, buddy. It's all you.What was that?I bogied the fifth hole. I'm still pissed about that.I'm promoting you to bank manager. I've got my eye on you, boy. Don't you forget it.So I got a call from the police department.I spent a couple years in prison myself. So I backdated some stock options. Excuse me for trying to help our bottom line, right?We are their slaves.Honestly, I prefer for all my top guys to have been in the Big House. We've all eaten the slop. There's a trust there you can't break.Could you look through these numbers and let me know which of our five branches have been lagging behind in profit?You're a VP, buddy. You do it all now.Carl, I'm glad you could join us. So, to keep you all updated, we should be merging with Korean Bank International within the year.I know that Maple's where you got your start, but if I don't lay those people off then I get laid off. It's a vicious cycle.If we don't close these branches than KBI will buy our competitor instead of us and put us all out of business. If you want to be an executive and get to do fun stuff like your microloan project, then you also have to be the bad guy who lays people off. That's why we get paid the big bucks. To make the hard decisions.Some asshole protestor threw a rock at my head.I wish using hoses wasn't such bad PR.What is the best way for us to enter the teenage credit card market?Yes.Nice. Anyone else? Carl?That's why they're such a ripe market. Any ideas on how to pick that low hanging fruit?I like that. I like that a lot.And I need to talk to you. You mind doing a little ceremonial translating?Believe in yourself and the world believes in you.KBI is the at the forefront of the financial world.
