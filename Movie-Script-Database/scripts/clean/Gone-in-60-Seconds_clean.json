Imagine us selling cars?Mother -- !You remember that, Kip?After he died ... I think that's what I missed most of all ... That there was no different cars every night ... When I started hanging around Otto's ... And he started showing me the things ... It was a way to kill two birds ... Put food on the table for you and Kip ... And ... Ride in different cars every night ... Just like when Dad was here.We do it.

Right.I'm on the move -Not my girl anymoreWhat do you want from me?This one ...How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?Thank-you ...Ain't we good-timing here ... ?Dad'd be proud --What era was that -- ?As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?We've got to shake them tomorrow night. I'm making that your problem. That's called delegation of duties. You like it -- ?Okay. Tomorrow night it's on. Each team has been assigned their ladies. The teams are: me and Sway. Donny and Freb.

Bozo, the very sexy clown --No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...Having fun, Kip?How's it going?C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?I know. But let's prep 'em. We could stay here all night... That wouldn't be good --You okay -- ?Too early to tell. Nervous?That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous.

The dumb shit is over ...You know my back.Not badDon't look so glum, Detective. It's a beautiful day, the birds are singing, and there's a container ship on Pier 14, that's guaranteed to bring you glee ...Consider me gone, Detective --Double-meaning intended --Split it up. Any word on Donny?What happened to Sway?You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand. Give 'em sixty ...Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels likeI'll see you soon --Thought I'd go for a ride -You'll see me ...Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?I dunno.
