{"Starman": {"SHERMIN": {"raw_line": "Marc Shermin, National Security Agency.This has always been my favorite time of day.Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?Can you see under the faceplate?There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...Was there visual contact?It could have been anything.People have made mistakes in these situations before.Oh, Jesus.The other one is alive!Get Fox.It's real, George.I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...Neither did I.We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.Wait, wait... What are my orders if we find this thing?What do you mean by 'contain?'Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.Lock in.Give it a rest, Lyman.Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?Then it's not an accident that they found us.Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.We always were.There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.I know, but...You married, Major?To the same woman?I tried it once... Fourteen years ago... 'I was a lousy husband and a worse father. The only thing I'm good at is this... At least until yesterday.How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?Listen to this. A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...The police think he was high on drugs...What do you think?It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.Why the clicking language though?Sorry to disturb you, sir, but there's been some trouble next door. I'd like to ask you a few questions.There's a possibility that Mrs. Haydn's been kidnapped. We're hoping you might have seen something.George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere.No, no... A .45, it probably got it in the woman's house. They were last seen in downtown Eau Claire...It's taken on a disguise.It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.The extraterrestrial now looks like this.You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...I don't like it, George...It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.Are you ladies through?...Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?Terrific.Huh?... Eh... no, there isn'tYeah, thanks. We appreciate that.You saw that?I wouldn't think so.We will. Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.Doesn't make sense.Get this back to the copter.Mrs. Haydn, please come out. We don't want to hurt you or your friend. Please put down your weapon and come out.Okay, fan out. These people have a gun but we want them alive. Understand?Mrs. Haydn, we don't want to hurt you. Put down your gun and come out. We just want to talk to your friend.Tell him I'm not here.Get me a radio. At least I won't have to look at his face.I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.You trace it yet?This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.Is the man who kidnapped you there now?Get a highway patrol unit over there.Mrs. Haydn, I'm going to have to ask you to stay where you are.Marc Shermin.Do you know what you were kidnapped by?Mrs. Haydn...Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?What's he planning to do in Lathrop Wells? Is he meeting someone there?You get that, Lyman?Any sign of either of them yet?Okay. Tell the highway patrol to block all major arteries off 70 from here to Elmo's.Hello George.What's all this for?We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.That's the chance we have to take.Then you're going to have to do it without me.You're talking about taking a life. The most unique life form on this planet. I think we're better than that.Hello...We can't let you do that.All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George.I'm afraid we can't let you go.George...

When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'Say it.The driver will...Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take... ...this part.

I do not speak English.'You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike... You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.Not every car, but... a car will stop... Maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen...Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and......you'll have plenty of time to get to where you want to go.Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on. Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.No.You might need this.Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.Well... I'm going to go now.Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me... Goodbye.Yes?I'll stay till you get on the bus.See? You're going to be okay.Goodbye.It's a kiss... Goodbye...Oh no...What happened?Okay, you win. Get in.Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?You thought we were a different planet?!Stars...

Was he a good friend?A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.It's bad.What are you doing?Yes.Nobody knows.I don't know.I've noticed...

I think you're looking for me. I was kidnapped in Eau Claire, Wisconsin a couple of days ago. But I'm free now.Jenny Haydn.

Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.I only called to tell you I was free and not to shoot anybody I was with if you see me.I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.I changed my mind. Thanks.It's me again...I need a fast ride west.You sure this is your car?Slow down, slow down.I told you I'm looking for someone.I don't know where he is.What? No, of course not.We better find him before that.If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?Pull over. I've got to get back there.It's easier not to tell if you don't know.Sure.Don't worry. I'll be all right.The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.Come on.I didn't ask to come along on this trip, but I sure as hell am going to be the one to say when I get off.Where are you going?Why can't we wait here for a ride?We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.Even if we walk five miles, it's not going to make any difference.Where did you learn that?We're not going to get a ride tonight.No one's traveling in this weather.I will. I will. We still have another day.What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm.What are you saying?We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.We'll get a ride in the morning.Can you close the door?You're damn right I am.Open your shirt.Oh, you're warm... put your arms around me.Take your shirt off.Nothing.Good morning.You don't forget anything, do you?Hello... hello. How are you this morning?No, they don't talk... We talk to them.Oh, you're pretty...Yes, they are.But...I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.I want it.You don't make money gambling. You lose it.Do you have a good map of Death Valley?What for?Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.This is crazy. We don't have time for this.You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.The cook again?If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass.It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.What will you say about us?We can.This is yours...I'd like to...Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?Yes.How long will it take you to get home?Would you like to listen to some music?I'm sure we could find a country and western station.Don't worry.
