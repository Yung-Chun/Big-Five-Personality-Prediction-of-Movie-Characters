What are you so afraid of?!Elsa...?Elsa!Elsa! Wait, please!Elsa, stop!No.No.No.Wait, no!No. No. I'm completely ordinary....And my sister's not a monster.It was an accident. She was scared.

No, I was raised in a castle....Oh well, it was all my fault. I got engaged but then she freaked out because I'd only just met him, you know, that day. And she said she wouldn't bless the marriage--Yeah. Anyway, I got mad and so she got mad and then she tried to walk away, and I grabbed her glove--Yes. Pay attention. But the thing is she wore the gloves all the time, so I just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt.Yes, they did.... But Hans is not a stranger....Of-the-Southern-Isles?...Sandwiches.Probably John.Dreamy.Foot size doesn't matter.Picks his nose? FROZEN - J. LeeExcuse me, sir. He's a prince.Ew.

Except maybe you--You mean the love experts?...Please tell me I'm almost there....Does the air seem a bit thin to you up here?Ha ha. Thank goodness. Catch!Thanks! That was like a crazy trust exercise.Whoa.Go ahead. I won't judge.Ha. It opened. That's a first.You should probably wait out here.Last time I introduced her to a guy, she froze everything.You too, Olaf.Just give us a minute.Elsa? It's me...Anna?!Elsa, you look different.... It's a good different.... And this place is amazing. FROZEN - J. Lee...I'm so sorry about what happened. If I'd known--But I just got here.So do you....Actually, about that--He's just like the one we built as kids.... We were so close. We can be like that again.Elsa, wait--You don't have to protect me. I'm not afraid. Please don't shut me out again. FROZEN - J. LeePLEASE DON'T SLAM THE DOOR. YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP YOUR DISTANCE ANYMORE.Yeah, but--ACTUALLY, WE'RE NOT.I GET THE FEELING YOU DON'T KNOW?ARENDELLE'S IN DEEP DEEP DEEP DEEP SNOW.You kind of set off an eternal winter...everywhere.It's okay, you can just unfreeze it.Sure you can.

Do.Prince Hans, are we just expected to sit here and freeze while you give away all of Arendelle's tradable goods?And that's another thing; has it dawned on you that your princess may be conspiring with a wicked sorceress to destroy us all?Treason?!I volunteer two men, my Lord! Be prepared for anything, and should you encounter the Queen, you are to put an end to this winter. Do you understand?It's getting colder by the minute. If we don't do something soon, we'll all freeze to death.What happened to her?Her own sister.There can be no doubt now; Queen Elsa is a monster and we are all in grave danger.This is unacceptable. I am innocent. I'm a victim of fear. I've been traumatized. Ow! My neck hurts. Is there a doctor I could...No? And I demand to see the Queen!Weselton.

There's soup and hot gl\u00f6gg in the Great Hall.Here. Pass these out.Princess Anna has given her orders and-- FROZEN - J. LeeDo not question the Princess. She left me in charge, and I will not hesitate to protect Arendelle from treason.Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy. Easy. Easy....Princess Anna is in trouble. I need volunteers to go with me to find her!We are here to find Princess Anna. Be on guard, but no harm is to come to the Queen. Do you understand?Queen Elsa! Don't be the monster they fear you are.I couldn't just let them kill you. FROZEN - J. LeeAnna has not returned....If you would just stop the winter, bring back summer...please.I will do what I can.I'm going back out to look for Princess Anna.If anything happens to her--Anna. FROZEN - J. LeeYou're so cold.What?What happened out there?You said she'd never hurt you.Anna.A true love's kiss.Oh, Anna. If only there was someone out there who loved you.As thirteenth in line in my own kingdom, I didn't stand a chance. I knew I'd have to marry into the throne somewhere--As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course. But no one was getting anywhere with her. But you-You were so desperate for love you were willing to marry me, just like that.I figured, after we married, I'd have to stage a little accident for Elsa.But then she doomed herself, and you were dumb enough to go after her.All that's left now is to kill Elsa and bring back summer.No, you're no match for Elsa. I, on the other hand, am the hero who is going to save Arendelle from destruction.Oh, I already have.Princess Anna is...dead.She was killed by Queen Elsa.At least we got to say our marriage vows...before she died in my arms.With a heavy heart, I charge Queen Elsa of Arendelle with treason and sentence her to death.Elsa. You can't run from this!Your sister? She returned from the mountain weak and cold. She said you froze her heart.I tried to save her, but it was too late. Her skin was ice.
