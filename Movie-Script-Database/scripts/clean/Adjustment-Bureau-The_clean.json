I'm sorry... I'm really sorry...How are you feeling about the speech? David has not noticeably aged and yet he's more tempered and subdued than when we last saw him. We `hear it in his voice:Tell me at breakfast.Why not?What? Are you crazy?!Does it matter?Elise, pleasure to see you again.He's announcing today.What's okay? It's not okay. The one thing you can't be this. time around is impulsive. That's why we're announcing the way we are,David, what the hell?Great. Perfect solution. Now, let's pay and get you over there. Charlie waves the waiter over to give them the check.The speech is in 30 minutes.You can literally walk there after the speech. David nods, his suspicions fading.I'm wrangling him right now--I've just never seen you like that. David can't possibly explain.\"I'm going to-postpone my announcement to have brunch with a woman?\" Postpone any speech. I know she made an impression on you but this is ... Charlie just shakes his head, unable to comprehend. A beat.\"What is it about her?Good Morning America at 7am tomorrow, then you have the bankers group... David, are you listening?

He'll be disappointed.Hi there. I'm David Norris. And I'm running for the US Senate.Kids: Samantha, painting, and Ricky, Little League. John Pascal. Wife: Anna. St. John's grad. Two year old: Loyita... He stops. Knows this cold. His finger runs down to a Realtor's Association breakfast in Nassau County four days out.I had some tea. (sees Charlie's not in theWhat?Well, it's over. And it's going to be a blowout... David puts on a brave face. . .but this is the first moment that he realizes not only is he going to lose, but he's going to lose big. It's going to be a grand,. public humiliation.Actually just looking for a place to be alone for a minute before I head in there.Thank you.What are you doing in here?Oh... . What did you do?It's almost midnight. They'just caught on now?Are you for real?Hard to argue with that.I'm \"that guy.\"No.You weren't running, for Senate at the time.He crushed me. She has beautiful eyes. And an exceptional gift for conveying empathy...Winning would feel better. But losing has its advantages.The only time a politician is alone is when he's asleep.. .or in the bathroom. After eight years in politics that gets kind of hard to take. She tilts her head a little, gives him a curious look.Thank you...It's the champagne. Brines out the Hallmark in people.Why not? I have to think up some good platitudes for my speech. He takes a gulp of champagne.Apparently, even if I hadn't been caught dropping my drawers in the middle of a senate campaign I would have lost the election anyway because I'm too blunt.The TV pundits.\"Field.\" \"Lynfield.\" A beat. She shrugs. Then they lean toward each other... and kiss. It turns more and more passionate. When they finally pull apart:Holy shit. She seems just as surprised. They look at each other and laugh. Just then the bathroom door opens. It's Charlie. He sees David and the woman.Wait. The woman turns to face David. Suddenly two hotel guards turn the corner and spot the woman.I'm really not sure. David has a huge grin on his face.But I think I'm ready to give my speech.I grew up in Red Hook and I don't want to shock anybody but I got in a few fist fights along the way. Laughter ripples through the crowd. We don't know enough yet to get the joke.And we used to have a saying when you got in a fight: \"it's not whether or not you get knocked down -- because eventually everyone does -- it's what you do when you get back up.\"But I am... But I am going to get backup. I wanted to come out here tonight and give you a victory speech, a speech I've dreamed of giving foremost of my life. But life doesn't always deal you the cards you want. The audience sobered now. Reflective.My life changed when I was ten years old. My entire world turned upside-down.' His audience,. knows exactly what he's talking about.And as I looked for something to -hang ;on to, something; to help me cope' with what had. happened the only thing that made sense to me was service. Finding a way to do something with my life that left this world a little better than I found it. The audience is moved. Tears begin to well up. People dab at their eyes.Hello?Give him 3227. I'm not used to this phone yet.Really?Sir, there's someone--No way... It's the woman from election night.', He leans around to try to see the front of her face. \"It's definitely her. His eyes drift down at her legs. Just then she opens her eyes. She recoils for a second;. Then` her eyes soften when she realizes who it is.Your skirt was so short I couldn't help it.Skirt, dress, same thing.So do shorts, dear.I have one but, unlike you, I wouldn't say it in public.Hello...? Hello? David looks at his. phone. The signal has gone to zero.You're relentless.I just started a new job, today.Something got into me. He means her. They stare at each other.What's the deal with you and argyles?At least my clothes match.The belt and shoes are black.There you` go with the platitudes again. I guess it wasn't the ch mpagne . His blackberry goes again. RING-RING.Hello? Hello? He shakes his head. It's dead again.Depends what the telecom lobby thinks of your voting record.Oh, Jesus...I'll pay for the damage. He pulls out his wallet. There's $7 inside. She laughs.Give me your number and I'll send you a check.It's my first day at the office!No! He grabs the cup with both his hands over hers.You're crazy. Actually crazy. The phone on David's lap'RINGS again. She snatches it with her free hand.Who was that? She shrugs. Sorry, pal. He lunges for his phone, but she holds it on the other side of her body.What is this, third grade?The morning after .I lost I woke up thinking about you . That melts her. Instantly. All her bravado drops.Guess who I just sat down next to on the bus?The woman from election night.She kissed me. I just didn't fight it.Charlie? David looks at his phone. \"Call Lost\" on the screen. David hits redial. Gets a fast busy.' . This is ridiculous. He pockets his phone.Okay... Daviddecides he doesn't need to announce himself.Doesn't anybody bother getting in before eight at this place? David passes a couple of empty offices on his way towards a large corner suite where a secretary sits outside an office marked \"Charles Traynor, Chairman.\" She's smiling.Susan? He leans across her desk, touches her arm. She stays dead still. David rushes through Charlie's door:Call 911! Something's wrong with Susan!Jesus! Three men in business suits talking by the window spin to see David. it's Mr. Richardson and-two aides we recognize as the \"security guards\" who chased Elise away on election night.What the hell are you doing?! Richardson blinks Clearly surprised. Then:Hey. The suits stare back in silence for a beat, then turn back to talking amongst themselves -- though at a lower volume.Can somebody tell me what's going on?Who are you guys?What the hell is happening to me?I just... came to work...Whatever you were doing to Charlie back there... it wasn't misplacing his keys.Why Charlie? What did you do to him.Yes...He said I could go.You said I could go. Richardson walks over to him.Why does it'matter?Why do you care.?What the hell-- What are you-- Richardson removes the piece of paper that Elise wrote her number on from David's wallet--No! And burns Elise's number. David strains and tries to pull loose from the vice-like grip of the four Intervention Team men. But he can't get free.What is wrong with you people?! Richardson drops the paper on the floor and lets it burn. ON David's reaction CUT TO:Ice water.Okay. Harry can see that David is still very shaken.Thanks. David walks away, still trying to get his bearings in the new reality he now knows. Charlie comes around a corner.Sorry...Fine. How about you?No headaches or--After the meeting.I lost her number.I was pickpocketed.I was` raised to believe there's something behind the curtain. I just never pictured it quite like this.You should know. You can read my mind, right?He knew what color I was thinking.So? Harry looks away. He's crossing a line. He's really putting himself out there:it-;' s like a sixth sense for you?What did they do too Charlie?What type of risk?That's all?What would your colleagues do to you if they knew what you were telling me? This is precisely what Harry has been worried about.They're not following me?Why are you helping me?Why do they care if I'm with Elise?Why do they care? Harry looks back at him. Taken aback a bit by how much David seems to care.You have no idea?They send you here to tell me that?I'm ready... I changed a few things last night.Stop the bus.Now.Elise! The woman turns around. And it's her...Hi.I rode the Ml to work every day for the last three years hoping one day I'd run into you again. She's amused, rather than moved, because she doesn't buy it.I couldn't.No girlfriend. She looks at him with continued skepticism. But his expression is dead serious.Can we go somewhere and talk? She hesitates. It hurt when he didn't call. She's angry at herself for that, but it's the truth.I just got sick.One second.And...I might have to push the speech.I just ran into Elise. He hangs up.We've known each other since we were kids. We have a shorthand.Doesn't matter. Let's take a walk. His focus on her is absolute. But she's wary of getting reeled in again.Somewhere far. We have a lot to talk about.I'll take my chances.My-speech will always be there, you might not be.Walk with me and I'll explain that. She's still dubious. His phone vibrates. This time he turns it off .I'm not losing you again. I'm not letting you out of my sight.Can we walk? The moment she finally relents, CUT TO:you have a boyfriend?It wouldn't matter.Okay... if you were married it would matter.I didn't have your number.It was taken from me. I was mugged.Your number was in my Wallet and they ,:took it.I'm serious. What else could possibly-explain my fawning all over you on that bus three years ago...and again today and not calling you in between?I swear to God I didn't have your number. I swear on my parents' graves.I didn't even have a last name to try to track you down. Do you know how many pages come back when you type \"Elise\" into Google?That's not fair.I haven't announced yet but... soon.That concession speech I gave sure did. You had everything to do with that. Elise smiles.You know entirely too much about me given how little I know about you.According to Maxim, I'm supposed to \"maintain eye contact and ask you what you do for a living.\" It's the first witty comment h6' :s made this time around. He's just barely starting t6\u00c2\u00b0'loo\u00c2\u00a7`en up.Oh..I think you have the wrong idea about me.Is there a performance of this company coming up that I could watch?I'm there. You hungry yet?We could wait an hour and call it lunch.So unfair...Thank you. You're... Paul, right? De...Santo?David.Why?Do you ever get nervous when people watch you?I get more anxious alone in my apartment than in front of an auditorium full of people. Everything's backwards for me.How did you find me?It's okay.I told you I'm not letting you out of my sight.Come with me. Come and watch.We can reschedule the speech.Where does your company perform?Okay. David and Elise stop to say goodbye to-each other.just want toThanks. Thanks a lot. David turns back to Elise.Whatever happens...I'm not going to let anything stand between us this time. It's such an odd thing to say, if you don't know what David has gone through. She gives him a quizzical look. But she's also moved by his,toneNot this time. He leans in to kiss her--I'll see you in two hours.What?.I'm here today to honor that, and to announce my intention to run for the United States Senate...I have to see Elise now.Tomorrow. After GMA. He heads for the door. Charlie follows.This is different. Trust me, it's different. David leaves.Elise ...I doubt you'll ever get this message but--Can I have the number for the Manhattan Modern Ballet...Do you have a phone book?I must have forgotten. It's been a while.Why are you so.determined to keep us apart?The Plan? If there is a Pi ri you misread it.Then your Plan's wrong.I don't care. Richardson grabs him and pushes him against a brick wall.Why are you keeping us apart?Three times? Bullshit! If I'm not supposed to be with her then why do I feel like this?You don't know, do you? You don't know why they're keeping us apart...You're in a nice suit but the reality is you're just a minion aren't you? David pushes past Richardson and walks into a busy restaurant. McCrady quickly consults his Planbook.I don't care what you put in my way, I'm not going to give up. David walks off, leaving Richardson standing there.Jesus:., Is this how far you people will go?! He rushes toward the accident--How much longer?I didn't say I had to meet anyone.You're not a real cop, are you? You're one of them. Somebody could have been killed in that crash! Doesn't that make you--Sergeant! He goes to the highest ranking guy on the. scene.I know you heed a statement from me, but do I have to stay here to give it to you or--17th Street between 10th and 11th. And sir, you might have to break some traffic laws getting there. So take this. He hands him a $100 bill. A light that just turned greenGo through that-- The driver blows through it as it turns reI'm in serious trouble here...You're incredible. How did you get that good?That's a lot of motivation for an eight year-old. She waves to the other dancers and receptionist in the lobby and they exit on to--Sure... it was the only constant in your life, aside from your parents...Oh... David's phone buzzes. Caller ID shows it's Charlie.I'm a candidate for the US-:Serrate. I don't have to punch out''when I leave. David sends the call to voice.maiCouple houtrs while I'm out of touch won't:ill him.I'm a terrible dancer. I don't dance. Elise climbs out. David follows.You're going to teach me to dance in one night? Not happening.Yes. She spins and shoves him against the wall. Forcefully kisses him. Then pulls free.Holy shit...Serious, serious.trouble...Hurry where?I've been told I have trouble feeling.That's different. I mean--In private. With women AlthOugh that might be changing. Is there any style of dance you can:'t do?To make an ass of myself for the third time in one night? \u00c2\u00a74`r, 6'.Hmmm, could get ugly... He looks down an alley as if he's noticed something. When she looks, he takes off like a bat out of hell--Quit complaining and run. She catches up. He spins and digs it out. He can't dance, but he sure can run. He pulls away and wins.Yes!!!! He pumps his arms in a victory dance.You said \"no rules\". She punches him in the stomach. Hard. He crumples, completely unprepared for it.You're insane.I'm serious. You're a maniac. You should come with a warning label.Doesn't this song make you feel like you're at your high school prom?Before sixth grade I spent about half my time in the principal's office.The only person who spent as much time down there as me was a girl I had a huge crush on so I didn't mind too much.No... My dad filled vending machines.After my brother died my Dad wanted to get me out of town for a while. We went to Washington and the day we arrived he took meto the. Capitol. We ended up sitting in the Senate gallery;,all day. We could see that from the end of my block, but-be never once encouraged me to go to Wall Street. His idol was JFK. He thought business guys were selfish.I want to matter. I don't think that's just forrhim. Elise,. tucks her head into his shoulder.Just make sure I make it to Diane Sawyer on time and I'll be fine. Elise looks at him for a long beat.Believe what?I. don't want perfect.,.I haven't stopped thinking about you since the moment I met you. I want you in my life--Listen to me--Elise, listen! I don't care. We'll work it out... I've spent my whole life wondering why it takes auditoriums of people to fill the empty space inside me. Then I met you...and realized it doesn't. She looks at him. He means it.That wasn't the effect I was going for... She smiles...then laughs out-loud--You been up long?Did you wake up in. the middle of the night?I thought you never sleep through.I won't hurt you. They kiss more... and then get swept up by it...What's wrong..Oh... I didn't-- I guess we hadn't gotten to that stuff yet...How long?Was it serious?What happened? Complete honesty.What an idiot.But it was:h'ard to leave.Me too. David looks at the clock.I have this Diane Sawyer interview.Only people who haven't spent enough time with ' me to know the 'truth.By my campaign manager mostly.With a childhood friend. So I don't think that counts. And, truthfully, that's how we celebrate things we're I'm from.that a euphemism, Diane? She laughs.I think Americans are tired of electing automatons whose every word and move is stage-managed so as not to offend anyone. I think they want somebody who doesn't hide who he is or what he really believes. I guess I'm hoping they want to elect someone who's actually like them.You'd be surprised at the number of underwear companies that have approached me to be their spokesman. Diane bursts out laughing. The floor techs are laughing too.You can call her that. And yes. Definitely. David is looking at a text from Elise as he speaks. It says: \"I want to go to bed with you.\"God dammit!What happened to Free Will?You expect me.'to believe that?If you're in control of the important things then you're incompetent cause when I look around at the world these days it seems pretty fucked.Why are you trying to keep me from Elise? Or are you just another lackey who doesn't really know? Thompson studies David for a long beat. Then decides it's time to level with him.Stop. Don't tell me this.Stop.Why does it matter to you who I love? Some skeleton of hers `is so bad I won't get elected? I don't believe that!Stop talking. It's not working.I don't care who you are. I don't care who's orders you're following.Who said anything about running.We both know if you could have we wouldn't be standing here having this conversation... Thompson stares back. He's never dealt with such temerity...You already did once.' And I'm still standing...The only thing we have in this fucked up world are the choices we make. And there's nothing you can do to me that will get me sign them away.What do you want?What?I don't believe you. I thought we already established that. A beat.Don't say that. Don't.Really?You're going to: be fine.It's; going to be fine. And as incredible of a dancer as you already are, yot're just going to get better and better... DavidV;embraces her again, so she won't see the tears welling in his eyes.I...I have to go make a few calls. His voice cracks. Elise notices.I'm just...happy for you...I'm started.I think I need... I...Do you still serve neighborhood guys here or just the tourists? The bartender smiles big. A couple people at the bar notice him. Then others notice and they start whooping it up for him. He doesn't know any of them-but they sure know him.Why are you here? REVERSE to REVEAL Harry, in a suit and raincoat.About what?Why, then? Why do they care so much?Why are you so different than they are?My mom?When Thompson told methe choice as Elise or the White House I barely hesitated.Before I met Elise that was all that mattered. Now I hardly notice. She's all I think about.Is she happy with him? Tell me she is and I'll walk away.Harry... is she happy?Will you help me:\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Just help me get to her...What if Icould move as fast as you can?Teach me about the doors.The first day, after they caught me, they carried me through one.I thought it was a hallucination at first. Eventually I realized it's how you move around so fast. If you don't want to help me because of what they'll do to you...okay, that's your choice. But if this is about protecting me then shouldn't the choice be mine?You know, when I do town hall meetings I usually get introduced to forty or fifty people between when I walk, through' the door and when I start speaking. But when I'm done with the speech I can call on each one of them by `game. A beat...Are they ever locked?Let's go. Harry smiles and hblds,.up a photograph of.the Manhattan County Court Building in Foley Squa:e:.North Moore St. Just south of the coffee shop... Red door. I come out on Broadway, near Leonard St. Harry looks at a photo of what David just described.(eyes closed, trying toOkay ...so... I hightail it East-to Lafayette no, it's Crosby Street there. INT. DANCE COMPANY -- Nit;HT Elise dances.I'd knock the Yankees cap off his head and go through the door before he has a chance to pick it up... A thinsmile forms on Harry's face and grows...How am I doing?Could I ever learn to read that? Harry shakes his head. Impossible.No matter how hard I tried?Is that me?I want to ask you what it says.. .what she's thinking.. .bit somehow that feels ...wrong.The fastest path is getting to the blue door right off the bat...But if I can make it...I'.Il have caught them completely bysurprise.The marriage is scheduled for ten minutes from now.I'm going for the blue door.Where is she? Water drips from his clothes onto the marble floor.Hi...You're not supposed to be weeping on your wedding day, Elise. Elise fights the emotion again welling inside.You were never happy with Adrian. You told me that. Elise puts her head in her hands.I love you. I know I've acted strangely. But, I love you.I've never felt anything like. this in my life.They'll reset me...They'll scramble my brain--But at least you'll know the truth.It's not in their \"Plan\" for us to be together. So they're trying to stop us.They said if we were together they'`d take dance from you and politic,s,from me. They hurt your ankle that night. They-- The door flies open again. David picks up a trash can and clobbers the fedora-wearing man who enters. He drops.He's not a cop. He's one of them. Another body slams into the door now. But the shield holds it shut.I'm going to: show you. He takes Elise's hand, opens the bathroom door, and walks her across the threshold into--Come on... We need to lose them. David walks her across the street and picks a door at random,The rain slows them down but they can track us. We have two orthree minutes. Maybe less. Elise is still speechless. He takes her hand.The ten year-old in me always mixed up winning elections with being loved. Then I met` you;,..Now you know. Youknota everything. And you have to leave mitie.You're not safe with me. If youLet's go.If they find us ...they'll take you from me.They'll take you from here. David touches his head'.Perfect. David picks a door. It's locked. He tries another. It'sThey're not supposed to be locked! David hears sounds coming from the building's central staircase. He looks down it to see four men in silver suits climbing up the stairs.Who are you?You can't oti{rn Fate... Tft , CHAIRMAN It's .more- complicated t,}an that, Fate am Free Will coexist They're;in tension with each other. And pure chance. A beat. David looks back at him...And all the misery, all the pain...Maybe we should go dancing.

You should take a vacation when we finish with this. You'll have earned it.Sure it would. Everybody needs a vacation. Even us.He spills his coffee when he steps out of Starbucks. The moment he comes through the door.Our models indicate between 7:00 and 7:05 am. Harry nods but he seems distant Richardson sees this.Grab him! David bolts out of the office as they lunge at him--You can't get away, David. David spins and rushes back into the main office, then down an internal staircase to the floor below. Jumps the last five steps and hits the floor hard. As he comes up he runs smack into another RSR employee who is frozen solid. David curses, then dives around the frozen employee to find Richardson, coming out of another office. down the hall. Again, physically impossible for him to get there that fast-- David spins and-- A DISTORTED WIDE ANGLE SHOT of a chloroform rag shoved right at us. FOCUS GOES IN AND OUT... FROM DAVID'S POV, BLURRY FOCUS as he's carried toward one of the large corner offices on the 40th floor. The nameplate reads \"Steve Kincaid.\" Richardson opens the door and ushers his men, carrying David,Yes, sir. No, sir. No, sir. I understand that, sir. Absolutely. I'll do that, sir.Yes.Can you reset him?What are my options?We're the people v ho make sure things happen according to Plan. David stares back at him for a moment. then leaps up. His rope comes off and the chair falls. He sprints toward an open door forty feet across the warehouse. Richardson makes a little gesture with his hand--Did you really think I couldn't see that coming? David dabs blood from his lip, which split during the fall.I can read your mind! David stares back.Yeah, really...Now,. why are you still deciding whether or not to run? David's hands go to his head`, involuntarily, an atavistic response, as if;s.omehow that will keep his thoughts from spilling out into view.You saw the futility of that back at the office. David's entire reality has finally been bent to the breaking point. He can't hang on any longer to an explanation for all this based in the world he's known to date...You just saw behind a curtain you weren't even supposed to know was there, Mr. Norris. Its jarring. I'm sure.It wasn't your fault. Your Path through the world this morning was supposed to be adjusted. Your coffee was supposed to.spill onto your shirt as you left Starbucks near your apartment. You would have gone up to change and arrived at work ten minutes later than you did. By then we would have left.Sometimes. when nudging a person back on Plan isn't enough we intervene directly.You need to worry about getting back on your Plan, David, not worry about us putting him back on his. David stares back, still trying to get his bearings.Only a handful of human beings know what you now know, David. We're determined to keep it that way.So before I let you go, you need to understand something: If you ever reveal our existence we will erase your brain. Your memories, your emotions, your entire personality will be expunged. Your friends and family will think you've gone crazy. You won't \"think\" anything because a blank slate can't \"think.\" Davidstares back.Do you understand what I just said?Not a word. Not one word about us. (long beat as he studiesHow is that possible? Why didn't we get an alert?You weren't ever supposed to see her again.Because, David, you can't be with her. And we didn't want to have to resort to this-- Four big guys grab David and pull his arms backwards like prison guards incapacitating a prisoner. Richardson reaches into David's pocket and pulls out his wallet--Tell me you're kidding. How could our Path-analysis miss this? McCrady just shakes his head, mystified... Richardson walks to the closet and pulls out his fedora:.'rlhek,e are they now?`This whole thing will be over in an hour.What?What's that?If Melton and Morris do their jobs right we'll be okay. But Richardson is clearly worried.Nice work.We're not out of the woods yet. He looks down at the inflection points in McCrady's Planbook.That was way too close. What the hell is going on with this case?Richardson. Yes, sir. Believe me, it was a surprise to me too. But I think we have it under control.I ' 11-keep you = posted, sir. Richardson hangs up the phone and turns .t look out at David. As he does he real zes David can see him.D` emit ! Richardson-steps back out of the sunlight.Get out of the sunlight. McCrady, notices David looking, jumps back out of the light.There is an entire world of women out there. I thought I made it clear this one was off limits. David takes off walking.Doesn't change the fact. David looks around, trying to figure out his next move.You know: why.There's no misreading what the Plan says about you and Elise. It's unequivocal.Do you realize who wrote this Plan?Well you should. You need to learn a little more respect. David shoves him off. Looks like he might take a swing at Richardson. Then his eye catches the complex diagram that McCrady is looking at in his Planbook.Because the Plan calls for it.That was chance. That wasn't us.It doesn't matter what you feel. It matters what's in black and white. David's ready to explode: at him when he sees something in Richardson's eyes. David stops.. .then his whole expression changes...Son of a bitch.Maybe you should try the subway. David holds him in a steely gaze.Amateur! That's an amateur's mistake!I want more red liUhtss--A traffic jam.He's getting out of range!What?Can 'I block the front door?Dammit ! McCrady's phone buzzes. He pulls it out and looks at the caller ID.Celebrate while you can. They'll just kick it upstairs now You have no idea what you're up against. David just looks at him. He'll deal with that when it comes...What?!Why was it changed?You spend your whole career hoping that one day you'll get a \"red- letter\" case.

Harry shuts the book, look's up to get a bead on\" the the bus, then takes off down Broadway, again, hoping to cut it off at Union Square.Dammit! Harry sprints out onto lark Avenue now, right behind the bus-- HONK! Harry turns just in time to see a.taxi skid into him. TRUNK! He rolls up onto the hood--I'm fine-- Will you hand me that? Harry points at his leather portfolio on the pavement a few feet away. We'll come to know it as a \"PLANBOOK.\"Oh...shit...We should talk. But not here. Go back to work and I'll contact you later today with a place to meet.The world's exactly the same as it's always been. You just understand it more completely now.A lot of people just collapse when they see what you've s'een. Their personal choices suddenly seem meaningless to them. Life starts to feel pointless.Most people don't. Harry looks over his shoulder, scans for any signs of his colleagues. He's far from relaxed.How are you feeling?Richardson was just trying to scare you.Because he set it up as a choice. \"Choose a color. Choose a number\"We can't read your mind or hear your thoughts. But before you make a choice your brain weighs options, and we percpite that. We know if you're going to go off Plan \"or not because, as long as we're close enough, we cansense it when it's about to happen.Seventh, actually.Made some small change in the way he assesses risk.I don't know. Something arcane. Something to do with mortgage- backed securities.Yes.That's why we're meeting out here.We don't have the manpower to follow everybody all the time. They're checking in on you. Just not here. Not right now. ON David's face considering this.I have my reasons. David studies him. Ha=rry's' clearly not ready to go intoYour entire reality gets shattered this morning and you want to know about a woman?I don't know.All I know is, given the amount of resources they've used, keeping you from her is pretty important to them. You're going to look for her aren't you? Again, David is silent.There are twelve million people in this city. On a slow day. You're not going to find her, you do realize that, don't yore-?You want my advice? Forget about her. Accept that you'`>ll never see her again. Move on with your life. ON David as Harry's words sink in.I would have come earlier but I had to wait for the rain. Water interferes with their ability to sense your decision tree. That's why we met on a boat last time.8ecause.,..she's enough, David. If you have =her r tau rtt .ght not need to fill the d side you with votes and ataplause'and dreams of one day becoming p sident... if Harry has:looked straight into David's soul.I've watched you a long time. They're right to want you in the White House. It would be good for the world. That's important but it can't be the only thing that matters.You know, your Dad was a smart man. He could have been a lot more -- and he wanted to be. So did your brother. But the Plan didn't call for that. This hits David hard.In my job, you implement the Plan...That wasn't me... that wasn't us at all. David takes all this in. After a;long be t he takes a drink. Then he offers the bottle to Harry, who h a esitates, then takes a drink as well.The public loves you.Front of a judge. Tomorrow morning.Thompson won't let you get near that courthouse.No. A beat.What do you mean?How do you know about that?Do you have any idea how complicated it is to navigate through those doors... how many thousands of permutations there are in even a simple several block journey?I've seen you do that The rain is supposed to stop in the nexthou'r. We're going to need all night to do this. And we're going to need aplace surrounded by water to do it.Put your hand on my shoulder. And don't let go until we've crossed the threshold.Maybe if you have a defective hat. They step through the door and onto--Hurry. Harry runs David to the front dooraf a brownstone. Opens the door. They move through i into--We're underneath Canal Street, which c as ,,A canal before rt, was a street. This is the jcity's':pumping station for downtown Manhattan. We're ten blocks from the courthouse.Lower Manhattan is a nightmare. Layer upon layer of substrate -- that's what we call the system of doors -- has been added over time. That makes it a lot more complex to navigate down here than it is uptown. And a lot slower. Harry dumps out several hundred photos of doors, interior and exterior, all below Canal Street.You ready?Your destination. Courtroom Six.Good.

He btio#ts to it -- a question: can he look at it., Harry opens tt up to a page in the middle.

What it was a few hours ago, before the rain, before we were down here. David looks at it, then looks away.You know what she's thinkin-g,'David -- as much as you need to know. The rest ...well...you're`built to feel that.ready to get back to work? Sometl`ing about that strikes Harry...Your father used to say that.

It's raining again.You can't jump the gun on this,,.. Getting there too early is almost as bad as getting there too late. Harry looks at his updated Planbook and consults his watch.It ',.t time.
