{"Black-Dahlia-The": {"VOICE OVER": {"raw_line": "I already knew him by reputation, had our respective records down pat: Lee Blanchard, 43-4-2 as a heavyweight, formerly a regular attraction at the Hollywood Legion Stadium.And he knew me, Bucky Bleichert, light- heavy, 36-0-0, ranked tenth by Ring magazine in 1937 fighting no-name opponents in no-man's-land division.Warrants was local celebrity as a cop. Warrants was plainclothes without a coat and tie, romance and a mileage per diem on your civilian car. Warrants was going after the real bad guys and not rousting winos and wienie waggers in front of the Midnight Mission.I told myself I didn't care.The 77th Street lieutenant tapped as official LAPD bookmaker had Lee as an early 3 to 1 favorite...He was better than I thought. It made what came next easier.I'd almost finished the Police Academy when the background check turned up my father's German-American Bund membership. Pressured by the FBI goons to confirm my patriotism, I gave the Alien Squad Sam Murakawa, a guy I'd grown up with, in order to secure my LAPD appointment.The old fuck never knew any better. Never knew what he cost me. Or Sammy, who'd died at Manzanar. I was a good fit in the snitch's jacket and with a little alteration I slipped easily into the whole suit.With no lead on the two escaped men, the heist quickly went from page one to page five. Two weeks later...One of Lee's snitches fingered Bobby DeWitt, a greasy little pimp with a yard long rap, as the brains behind the bank job.Hey. Canvasback!Mister Fire. Mister Ice. The hero and the snitch.Let go of him! Let go of him!From November through the New Year, Lee and I captured a total of eleven hard felons, eighteen traffic warrantees and three parole and probation absconders...After tours of duty, Lee and I would go to the house and find Kay. Sometimes she made dinner for us, other times the three of us would go dancing, or see a flick.I used a Warrant cops special prerogative and issued an APB on Lorna Martikova aka Linda Martin. I wrote up my day's report, omitting Marjorie Graham's lead on the old dyke. I didn't need Ellis Loew quashing it along with the skinny on Betty as the part-time prostie.Three days 'til Bobby De Witt hit LA. Three days since we killed four men.Barflies. Daytime juicers...The longer I listened the more they talked about themselves, interweaving their sad tales with the Black Dahlia, who they actually believed to be a glamorous siren headed for Hollywood stardom...I logged forty-six phone tips, about half of which were reasonably coherent. Lee left early, dodging any talk about De Witt. Ellis Loew stuck me with writing up the summary report, most of which concerned the numerous dead end leads, bogus confessions and three hundred new Dahlia sightings per day. It left me gut certain of one thing:Losing the first Bleichert-Blanchard fight got me local celebrity, Warrants, and close to nine grand in cash; winning the rematch got me a sprained wrist, two dislocated knuckles and the rest of the day off. Whoever said winning isn't everything got that part right.Back in LA, Linda Short let slip that her \"Mex\" was actually a local named Walter Wellington, who copped to making the film but quickly provided the cops his alibi for the Dahlia's missing days.Not that this stopped Loew and his boys from rousting spics all over town for a possible Dahlia frame-up. The circus was becoming a farce.I wanted to believe it was all about Lee. Tracking Lee through her...through the files he had collected.Strangers' recollections of a girl's last days leading me to a partner...But the deeper into her I got, the more I understood the detective's old saw: any dick worth his suit always takes a side: the perp or the vic.Most cops'll tell ya...one day you wake up and you're in the head of the killer...Angry. Powerful. In control. You're the perp.Few cops'll admit to walking the harder path...fear...pain...loss...Few will admit to waking up in the head of the vic.On my way over I played out their rap sheets in my head, trying to work up a head of hate...Loren Bidwell, three time Atascadero loser, falls for aggravated sexual assault on minors. Between prison jolts he confessed to all the big sex crimes.Charlie Issler was a pimp and a career confessor specializing in copping to hooker homicides. His three procuring beefs had netted him a year county jail time, his phony confessions two ninety day observation stints at the Camarillo nut farm.East 5th Street from Main to Stanford. Blood banks, liquor stores selling half pints and short dogs exclusively, fifty- cent-a-night flophouses and derelict missions...Banished by Ellis Loew, who dared me to try my word against a twenty-two year man and the city's future District Attorney. I confined the truth to Russ and Kay, and determined to spend my shifts trying to be the worst foot hack in history.A month passed. The Dahlia leads dwindled to zero and every officer except Russ and Harry were returned to their regular assignments. As for me, I'd been able to contain my Dahlia interests within the walls of the El Nido.But sometimes Betty came to me...What kept me up that night wasn't the idea of Fritz Vogel extorting criminals, or Fritz Vogel bracing Charlie the pimp to see if Betty had told him something about one of her johns...maybe even Vogel, himself...No......what kept me up was this thought: if Issler blabbed about Liz and her tricks I would have overheard. Fritz was confident he could keep me quiet.I closed out my glory days the only way I knew how--I chased the gone man.I got headshakes, bullshit broadsides and a strange series of tales that rang true. One had \"el blanco explosivo\" beating the shit out of three jack rollers, then buying off the cops with double-saws peeled from a large roll. Another had Lee donating 200 scoots to a leper ministry priest and then driving to Ensenada.I decided it would be wise to check in with the law before going out to question the Ensenada citizenry.Lee and Kay had lived in sin; not because their shack job was against department regs, but because the ghosts of their past had forced them to choose between love and passion, the veneer of a \"fairy tale\" only a band-aid for a fractured life.Our true vows were made in private; bury the past, bury our ghosts, and as Kay said, \"bury that fucking girl\"...Fire and Ice. The hero and the snitch. Bank robber and his best friend the bumfuck detective. Triggerman. Stooge. Weak point in a fairy tale triangle.Newton Street Division. Footbeat hacks carried metal-studded saps; squadroom dicks packed .45 automatics loaded with unregulation dum-dums.Kay. Lee. Madeleine. Betty Short. For one month I escaped them all.A fucking supercop.I escaped them all. Almost.It was a reunion of avowed tramps, old rutters who knew they'd never have it as good with anyone else... Afterwards we'd talk through the night. The Spragues...Crazy Papa Bleichert...Mostly, though we'd talk about Betty. Her utter malleability, a chameleon eager to please anybody...and the disrupter of every life close to me...It would last a month.In the scheme of things it wasn't much. Rich old lady gossip, as Jane put it.It came on then, big and ugly: bye-bye Bleichert at the bus stop, adios shitbird, has-been, never-was, stool pigeon harness bull.I tried to keep calm. I told myself that just because Emmett Sprague helped Mack Sennett build sets in the twenties didn't mean he had anything to do with a smut film twenty-five years later.I told him everything. Me and Madeleine, the Spragues. Withholding evidence for her. Everything. Even Lee. After all of it he only had one thing to say:Between my time with Madeleine and the local boom baron expose in the papers, I was practically an expert on Emmett Sprague's land deals...And if my hunch was right, we wouldn't have to look any further than one of Emmett Sprague's condemned bungalows. One that was isolated...abandoned......and most importantly, close to a water source...where one could drain a body of its blood.When I'd pulled George's print card that morning, I'd already laid fifty down with Russ that he was our guy. Amateur taxidermist, transient. If he was a cop 39th and Norton woulda been right in the middle of his beat...But I'd be lying if I said I hadn't wanted to nail the sicko myself, giving him ten rounds of Bleichert rage.Maybe he'd have gone for a gun or probably a knife, and the Bleichert fists would've given way to a full load of .45 in the chest.We took the fall together.Ever the consummate actor, Madeleine Sprague confessed to killing Lee by concocting a love triangle from the three of us...The Bleichert/Blanchard rematch fought over her hand, with Lee beating Emmett and demanding he \"hand over\" his daughter when she preferred me.So the brass girl took the fall for the whole family. And I took the fall for me. IAD cleared me on the motel shooting--a cop's code make-good for Blanchard's snuff. WE PULL OUT and see Bucky's cuffs, badge and gun sitting on the table in front of him....but I had people to protect...People who already knew that, for the briefest of times, and in the darkest of places, I had been so, so, good at some things.Thank you Elizabeth.", "clean_line": "knew reputation respective records pat lee blanchard heavyweight regular attraction hollywood legion stadium knew

See if Betty ever engaged in prostitution...Did she ever tell you she was in a movie? Sometime around November?Did she say what it was?Do you remember the names of any of the guys?What is it? You can tell me.Linda Martin?Are you saying the woman was a lesbian?Take their statements, Bill. I've got a little more here.Lorna Martikova. Omaha, Nebraska. Runaway. When'd you see her last?You couldn't have known.No shit Sherlock.Administrative Vice Squad?LAPD Homicide.Seen either of 'em?You tell me.Capice when your girls tell me that.Black Dahlia.What about this girl?Don't you fuckin' lie to me. She's fifteen fucking years old. So you come clean or I slap a contributing beef on you, and you spend the next five years servin' raisinjack to bulldykes in Tehachapi.Welcome back to earth, partner.Your fault for buying her all those chemistry classes.No.Thanks.You send me back to Warrants?Canvass around the Biltmore. If Red dropped her off there on the tenth maybe we can start reconstructing the last days before she got snatched.All I know is you should keep an eye on Loew and his boys. I didn't put it in my report, but Betty sold it outright when she needed money bad enough, and Loew's been trying to keep it kiboshed so it'll look better if he ever takes it to trial.And a grandstanding son of a bitch.What are you gonna do?Oh Jesus.She's right, Lee. You've pulled at least three misdemeanors here. It's out of control--Slumming, Miss Sprague?I'm a policeman.Homicide.You sleep with either of them?Are you lez?Why'd you rabbit last night?In Technicolor. What did you talk about?Betty ever tell you about a movie she did? Show you a viewfinder? Anything specific?You're cute.That's all anyone ever wants to volunteer: the alibi. Go ahead.I don't need your cash if that's what you're saying.Convince me.I know the address.Bucky Bleichert.So...You smooth things with Kay?De Witt gets out tomorrow, Lee. I was thinking maybe I should lean on him. Get Fritz Vogel and Koenig to do it--Bleichert. Homicide.Sure.A pleasure, Mr. Sprague.Thanks.Died of a heroin overdose.German.Very realistic.So when did you come here?I always loved the Keystone Kops.No Mrs. Sprague, I didn't.I grew up there.Not them, me. Do me. Be with me.Well. I think you kept your name out of the papers.Your mother would love that.How?You don't have to tell me this--I like you, too.Jesus--What is it?And that's all of it?Then be prepared, babe. There's fifty cops out there combing every bar in town looking for Dahlia info. You could be headed for the papers no matter what.You don't mean that.Tell me something. Why'd you want to meet Betty Short?How do you mean?I wouldn't know.You made the casting rounds together. Ever get any movie work?So what about the film can?A dirty movie?Was this around Thanksgiving?I think she's covering on the Mex angle. Maybe she knows him and doesn't want him taking a smut rap. Maybe he's white. The TJ stuff is sound, though. I'd detach Meg Caulfield from Wilshire Clerical to play cellmate for a day.Yeah. I did, partner. I did.Mr. Loew, it's not just Betty Short--Yes, sir.It's me. You want to get together?I'll pick you up in forty-five minutes.I have an apartment, you know.No. And I checked through the case file. There's no mention of that note-leaving number you pulled. Babe, I'm withholding evidence for you. It's a fair trade for what I'm getting, but it still shakes me. Is there anything you haven't told me about Betty and Linda?Jesus Christ.Blanchard!Not good enough.Notorious, maybe. Where's Lee?He's in trouble, you know.Kay. Lee--Short of winning?Thank you very much.That was County Parole. Bobby DeWitt bought a bus ticket at the Santa Rosa depot this morning. San Diego. Transfer Tijuana.Lee's down here and so is Bobby De Witt.Finish up with you and Blanchard.How long--He'll came back, Kay. I'm sure of it.Kay--He's coming back.Lee.I wasn't on the transfer list.Why?No.I heard that, too.They've rescinded the APB on Lee. If he doesn't show up in thirty days he's out.Like the guy who killed the Dahlia?Russ Millard wants me when Harry retires.What do you want, Ellis?Tell me about Betty Short, pops. Why'd you kill her?Come clean, pop.Tell me about it, Cecil.One more time, shitbird. Tell me about you and Betty Short.I'm the nice guy, Cecil. Keep that in mind.Convince me.You're a pimp.

Betty writes to one of her phantom servicemen boyfriends: \"...had drinks with a great girl, Sally Stinson, who thinks she way be able to help me get a job cocktailing...\"Yeah, I know.

Including his extortion deal. Tell him I'm goin' to the papers tomorrow.I'm Officer Dwight Bleichert and this is Officer John Vogel.Why?Kay.First thing.This man's LAPD. He's been missing in Mexico since January. He was last seen headed here.At least.I have two partners waiting for me in Tijuana.Blanchard? You've seen him? When?Is he still in town?I'm looking to get him out of a shitload of trouble.Thank you.Ernie. I need to see Ernie.I heard this man gave you some trouble a while back.He's my best friend.What happened?That's it?You tell me all of it and you watch what you say about my partner, or it's a B&E roust and the Ensenada jail.Does he know I'm staying here?So. Let's hear it.What's her name?Go on.Go on.Prove it to me. Prove it!You got a shovel?Good enough.What?Sure, babe.Hancock Park.I'm Officer Bleichert. LAPD. My I express my condolences, Mrs.--Like their mother. How old are they?Yes. Tell whoever cleans it up to use pure ammonia... Mrs. Chambers--Jane, do you know Madeleine and Martha Sprague? The next block over?I did a little work for them once.How do you mean?Bucky. Good-bye, Jane.Yeah. Pretty routine. Whattya know about the husband?Wonder how he made it?Oh really?I'm...looking for the hammer.Were you ever going to tell me?Were you ever going to tell me?Ever. Were you ever...?Who was the driver, Kay? Tell me. Tell me!You're not that old. And you're not very widowed.You seem to be doing all right.Little over a year.So how well do you know the Spragues?Your husband sounds like a good man.I read an article in the paper.Maybe your husband--It's not so strange.I'm a cop. Illusions aren't standard issue.I stopped her at a red light. One thing led to another. Why do you assume it was Madeleine?Jane. Don't be catty.God that is spooky.No thanks.And you mine.It's me.Nothing.Your father's Georgie Tilden war stories?Hey! Goddammit! Get back here!Babe--Babe. Goddammit.Wait--You didn't move far.Tighter'n a popcorn fart.I just thought...Maybe after all this time...There's something you might have forgot...Anything she might have said...My father.She killed herself a long time ago.Thank you for your time, Mr. Short. if--Look, Russ...I think...I may have it. I--Her! Her! I've got a hot one, padre. It's just...I want to search every fucking inch of every goddamn acre of Emmett Sprague property if it takes the rest of my shitty career. And I know exactly where we start.Box up the books and papers. Maybe light that lantern.Thing is, Russ. Thing is...There's another set of latents up there on the doorjamb...And my hands're shaking so bad I can't transfer 'em.We finally have it, Russ. All of it. All of her. All right here.No. Thanks. I'll stay here. I want to get up early and confirm these prints.And what is that, Emmett? Saps like me? Direct line to the straight dope? Or is that what you needed?George Tilden killed Elizabeth Short and the two of you covered it up.Of course. She looked like his daughter.How'd it all go down?He was a sick fuck and you knew it!What did you tell Betty? What did you tell her?Then?Pretend I'm stupid. For old time's sake.And then what? I come along? Daddy tell you to fuck me or was that your idea?What about sweet little Martha?Martha tell you this?Then she lied to get your goat, 'cuz no one ever called in a tip on LaVerne's.Passports. All four.I need to see it.Just to be sure. I need to see it.I need to see his grave, you tightass kiltwearing motherfucker. Where'd you bury George Tilden?Yeah, well. Old habits die hard.Yes, I'm fine.I know what you did, Ramona. You and Georgia. I've seen the painting. You sold it the day of the murder. You know I've got the book. And now I've got you.So tell me. Let me see.Tell me about Betty Short.Your husband bought her for George.For George--You tortured her.She lied about that. To get Madeleine's goat.How much of the hundred grand did Lee let you keep?He knew about Madeleine Sprague. He knew about Laverne's Hideaway.He blackmailed Sprague--And you knew it, Kay! You knew it all! He took that hundred thousand and split to Mexico and you let him go!He didn't leave, he ran. He ran from the bank job, ran from the frame on DeWitt. He knew who killed Elizabeth Short and fucking ran away! This whole time. You both knew everything--Adios yourself back to the Halls of Tripoli, shitbird. I've got business with the lady.I've been pointing my gun at a lot of people this week. But I haven't had much of a chance to shoot anybody. Whattya think?Aaaah, lassie. You wanna sell me short to the very end, eh?How 'bout the Mexican accent you used when you hired the private dick to track down Lee. Let's see the make-up job. Let's see the fucking dress, mamacita, that you wore when you chased after poor daddy's money.

Wife and kids thank you for the raise, Officer.Anything common in the sex beefs?Before this gets out of hand let's put the kibosh on something. If this gets a lot of publicity we're going to get a lot of confessions. So we keep some things quiet. This girl was disemboweled. You keep this information to yourselves. Not your wives, not your girlfriends, no other officers.Blood on the premises?The lab'll be the judge of that.Is it...all right to smoke, doctor?What's your best guess?Elizabeth Short.How many confessions so far?Double that by morning. More if Loew got the press excited with his purple prose.Too much publicity is a hindrance, Ellis. If you were a policeman you'd know that.Found it in storage down at the railway. Carbons of mash notes to sailors. Hundreds of 'em.Thank our friend Bevo Means at the Herald. Bevo's painting Betty and her black dress like some actress in that Alan Ladd movie, The Blue Dahlia. Should triple our confessions.No dice. You're a bright penny and I want you here. Betty's last known residences and KA's. Go to University Station and pick up Bill Koenig. Fritzie's sick. Keep Bill on a tight leash, and you write the report because Billy's practically illiterate.Call me Russ and get out of here.Good report yesterday, Bleichert.What next?Wrong again. But keep going.Bright penny. You're doing well, Bucky. Run with the ball.You calling your boss an evidence suppressor?You're a brighter penny than I thought. Betty sightings. Wilshire Division. I need smart pennies to eliminate the phonies from the tip sheet....and you don't recall any of the names Betty went out with last fall?No one who would do her harm?You have to tell us the whole thing, sweetheart. So think it through.Where was that?Why would you do that?And he willingly gave you a copy of the film? For nothing?Whattya think?Bleichert you are a very bright penny today. Well. Looks like it's blue movie night at City Hall.Long shot, Chief. Harry and I are headed down to TJ tonight. The Mex doesn't play as the killer. But maybe he showed it to someone--Bucky. Blanchard's in Tijuana. A border cop spotted him hobnobbing with a bunch of rough-looking Rurales last night.I asked Jack to keep you on.Because you're getting to be a damn good Detective, Bleichert. And Harry's retiring in two years. Need I spell it out?You been working this case pretty hard. Or is it the other way around?It's not as much fun once it moves to the back pages, is it? I hear they arrested two Mexicans in Juarez for the Bobby De Witt murder.You must be relieved.He'll be found if he wants to be found.Bucky.Nope.The pimp? I thought he said he'd never heard of her.Bright penny--So good ol' Fritzie's shaking down crooks, maybe sellin' 'em tip-offs before a roust.Easy, penny. They'd have to testify against him first. And that's not likely after he burns those carbons. But this Issler business--why hide the Issler- Betty connection?Cocktailing.You sit tight. Go hack to swingwatch. Me and Harry'll poke around.You'll get him, too. But you've got to cool your temper. It's all patience with the big fish or they wriggle off.We've found her. Meet me at 1546 North Havenhurst in half an hour.Bucky--Ma'am.Anything else, Miss Stinson?I'll be a chimp's priest, Buck. A chimp's priest--watch the air bubbles--I shoulda known that Johnny I d need a pro to lose his cherry...Never had 'em for a kink and a cherry, though...Pentothal's good for another couple hours. No way he can lie.There's a method to this, Bucky. What's your name, son?Answer me anyway.What's sixteen and fifty-two?Focus on January, Johnny. Your father--Yes. Fritzie. He wanted you to lose your cherry. He bought you a woman for two days. Is that right?This was at the Biltmore?We'll be done soon, Johnny. You met Liz Short at the Biltmore, too?And what did you and Liz do?Did you whip her?Johnny. Did you kill Liz Short?Easy son--It's all right...Do you know who did?When your Daddy found out you'd been with her, he tried to fix things didn't he?I think you should go outside.His statement. Signed.We should sit on this for a little bit. Until I can talk to a legal officer.It's the shithouse until you retire, you know that.I got your message, Bucky.It?Calm down, son. Tell me.All right, then. It's your ball. What do you wanna do?Bucky.God help her.You all right?Are you sure you don't want to came home?
