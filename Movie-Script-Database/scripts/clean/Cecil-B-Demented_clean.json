HONEY is dressed for the premiere in an elegant evening gown and her black hair is cut perfectly in the Louise Brooks style that has become her signature. She continues her press conference under the watchful eyes of her press agent CHARLES and her long-time assistant LIBBY, both of whom are also dressed for the premiere. ROOM SERVICE employees stand by, ready to serve.I tell everybody in Hollywood, when you shoot on location in Baltimore, you don't need to bring all the crew from Los Angeles. Baltimore really ia the best!...Look at this dump of a town! HONEY turns to her long suffering assistant, LIBBY. The press is gone and they are alone.Get me the fuck back to L.A. If one more asshole mentions a crab cake to me, I think I'll puke.No I didn't! I'm not interested in any kind of meal you have to beat with a mallet... A knock is heard at hotel door.Thank you Charles, darling. We'll be right with you. I'm excited. CHARLES exits.Do you think Pat Nixon got fucked in this hotel room?It's called the \"Presidential Suite\" isn't it?I BET SHE DID! Call the manager and ask him!It's your \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd to ask, Libby! Call downstairs and find out if Pat Nixon got fucked in my hotel room! I want to know!I was kidding Libby. He must think you're a complete lunatic! Good God, you'd do anything! A HOTEL MAID pushing a cart of towels and bathroom supplies comes around a corner and is completely star-struck.Did you hear what that little bitch said to me?In show business we say \"break a leg.\" NEVER fucking \"Good Luck\"!That cocksucker put a curse on my whole fucking premiere! HOTEL GUESTS let out a cry of shock at HONEY's language.Mayor Fenwick! LIBBY and CHARLES look to one another relieved as HOTEL GUESTS stumble out of elevator, shaking their heads in disgust.I love what you've done with this city.A fucking white limousine?!I'm not Liberace's boyfriend, for Chrissakes...My contract says black limousines only!(Turning on him with a\"Some Kind Of Happiness\" is aIt's burning my scalp! Ow! Ow! Ow!Oh God! That really hurt!(Screams in pain,.I mean... not little. . .10w budget. . .you know, cult.Please...Mr. DeMento?

She is wearing beautiful lingerie.Oh, God, I look terrible! CECIL and SPROCKET HOLES applaud triumphantly.Good... morning.\"Daughter\"?!I'm too young to play her mother!It doesn't feel right... I'm just not motivated...It's that fucking new multiplex that opened in the mall, isn't it? CECIL's face turns to stone as the rest of the SPROCKET HOLES watch, shocked at HONEY's wooden performance.Somebody's gotta pay for this insult! HONEY looks out and sees SPROCKET HOLES aping CECIL's self-destructive review of her reading; DINAH slaps her own face, LEWIS staples his own leg; RODNEY jams the sharp end of a rat-tail comb in his ear. This title will be replaced by a more recent critically panned big film hit we can get the rights to.Death to those who support mainstream cinema!Somebody's gotta pay for this insult! CECIL silently mouths the dialogue along with HONEY.From the empty movie seats of every good movie theater in America, we will rise to take back the screen!Death to those who support mainstream cinema!To be frank, Cecil, I would never do this picture in my real film life. The whole message is stupid - ask theater owners in any country and they'll tell you. Hollywood makes the best films in the world and I'm proud to be part of that system.But you can't cut the film with only a master!Please, no! Let's go back! I hate location work! 64. INTERIOR FEDEX VAN as it drives through downtown 64. streets and enters Jones Falls Expressway. PETIE is behind the wheel as LYLE and CHERISH study their lines in hand-written \"Raving Beauty\" script. CECIL hurriedly flips through TIME Magazine until he finds the article he wants. RODNEY and RAVEN torture HONEY with their constant touchups as PAM, CHARDONNAY, DINAH and FIDGET crowd in the back of van with equipment and guns as LEWIS reads a copy of \"Psychotronic\" magazine.Owwww! Please, Cecil. I'm a much better actress in the studio...Cecil, give yourself up! It's not too late...Come to Hollywood with me and I promise I'll get you a job as a production assistant on a real Hollywood movie.Cecil, please don't make me do this scene...How dare you play this rotten movie?! PAM pans the camera to BOX OFFICE LADY whose eyes light up in fear at seeing the \"actors\" in their terrorist outfits.$7.50 for this piece of shit?! BOX OFFICE LADY screams and locks herself inside as HONEY spray-paints S-H-I-T across box office glass.(To AUDIENCE, ferociouslyOh, craft service. Thank you, Fidget, but I never drink when I'm working but you're very kind. Do your parents know where you are tonight?Don't you think you ought to call them...?You know that's nonsense! Go ahead, call them up. I bet they miss you... LYLE ruins everything by staggering over, scarily high.I most certainly do NOT, Lyle. I can't believe you'd be a drug addict in the 90's - it's so retro.Please Rodney, those aren't roots - they're scabs on my scalp from the dye and they're raw! RODNEY sadistically squirts her roots with dye as HONEY lets out a cry of agony.OWWWW!! Please... please... Raven, you're a pretty girl, you could escape this madness...Well ...I'm sorry to hear that...OWWWW! Rodney, why do you want to hurt me? Gay men are supposed to be gentle...Oh God, stop...Cherish, this is America. They have the freedom to make bad films if they so desire...Oh, please...No...not at all.I'm working, Lyle!I. .I can figure it out...I. .I believe you.It doesn't say anything about a stunt in your rewrite.Maybe with an air bag or some kind of safety precaution...Alright, Cecil. I'm a professional... Roll the camera.But there are bullets in this gun...Which one of you assholes insulted our movie?!(Suddenly jumping backDON'T SHOOT! I'm Honey Whitlock and I've been kidnapped! HONEY is shocked when the POLICE tackle her and place her under arrest. DINAH grabs FILM COMMISSIONER and uses him as a human shield as she fires away, hitting several cops.But Cecil...you didn't write me any dialogue...That really is unforgivable, Fidget!No, Cecil... CECIL nods to DINAH who plays the tape. HONEY sees her ex-husband, a handsome movie star on screen with JAY LENO on \"The Tonight Show.\"This time, .1 have a fucking vision! CECIL's eyes light up in madman glee. 105. Cut to EXTERIOR \"STUDIO TWELVE,\" the one 105. professional sound stage in Baltimore located in the picturesque downtown neighborhood of Fells Point. Next day. A giant FILM CREW, all wearing \"Gump Again\" t-shirts, hustle and bustle on the first day of the film shoot, hauling expensive film equipment inside, setting up catering trucks, craft service tables and the temporary dining areas for the entire FILM COMPANY.

CHERISH, now heavily made-up and dressed \"riot-girl\" style, in a \"SINEMA\" T-shirt, steps forward. We see \"Andy Warhol\" tattooed on her thigh.Lyle? LYLE takes a big huff of glue in plastic bag and steps forward. He is dressed in scarily in 1970's junky wear meets 90's Hollywood sleaze, and sports a \"Herschell Gordon Lewis\" tattoo across his skinny chest.Don't worry, we've all taken a vow of celibacy for celluloid. No one gets laid until we've finished our movie. We're horny... CHERISH starts writhing sexily..but our film comes first.

CHERISH gives HONEY a suddenly jealous look.Let's move on!The first take is the only real truth...There are no rules in outlaw cinema, Miss Whitlock, only edges.

HONEY, out of her cell and unguarded for the first time, watches her \"stunt\" footage with pride as she gets the vodka bottle from their filthy dirty freezer and goes about the ritual of making the perfect martini. LEWIS, proudly displaying his brand, DJ's the music as CHERISH writhes in a sexy go-go dance for CECIL. CHARDONNAY painfully caresses her fresh brand and wails out the chorus of \"DeMented Forever.\" HONEY empties ice tray into martini shaker..There is no such thing as family. We are the orphans of cinema and without our movie, we do not exist!...
