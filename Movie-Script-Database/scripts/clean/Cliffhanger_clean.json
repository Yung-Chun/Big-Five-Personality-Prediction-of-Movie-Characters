Did he tell you about the time he almost made it up Everest?Well, if he's bored you with that bullshit, then this has to be the best part of a bad date. Right?Ready?Yes you can. You can do it. Don't look down. The whole way across, don't look down. Look at me. Just keep looking at me -- and you'll be okay.Sure?Hold on. I'm coming out to get you.Keep looking at me. Hold on --Falling.Any size, any color, any model.Just under six hours.This is new...Still find the dead ones the old fashioned way, I guess.If I did, I'd have to listen to you tell me one more time that it wasn't my fault.-- If I did everything right, Susan Collins would still be alive.Do you really believe all that? That it wasn't our fault?I'm not sure what I wish more, Maggie. That you meant what you said, just now -- or that it were really true then.Christ. You're in charge of Rescue now?Well, you're a better man than I am, Hal. Nothing rattles you.Good idea. Say, Hal? Why don't you come with me so we can show these rookies how to death-rig a woman properly?Maggie?Hi. Could you introduce us?Not the tag -- what do you call him?Poachers? Bastards...About four months, right? Christ -- it must have been just about his -- I mean her -- first flight --You can't do that alone --I'm making her nervous -- You hold her, I'll do the dressing.Got some fight in her -- that's good. What happened to Dave?I thought I came back to see if I'd learned to live with it. Well, big surprise. Coming back just tore me open all over again, like it all happened yesterday instead of a year ago. Nothing's changed. Including the way I feel about you. I didn't realize it till I saw you at the airport. But I came back for you, Maggie.No. Not here. I want you come with me. Start over, somewhere else.What the hell do you want?\"We\"? Talk to somebody who's still on the payroll. You've got a half dozen new guys --During the summer. On a bet.Maybe you missed the headlines -- but I don't do rescues any more. They're bad for my conscience. Fuck this one up on your own.Not like I was, pal -- her fingers brushed mine on the way down --I don't want the responsibility.Just backup.I'll lead. I left a few bolts last time I climbed this -- I think I can find some of them.Tell you what, Hal -- if we're still alive tomorrow morning, I'll give you the twenty bucks back, okay?Anchored!Rockslide!Anchored -- Anchored!It's kind of hard to resist --Come on -- the hard part's over.I thought the fuselage was broken. That looks pretty cozy.Something's wrong here --My ex.This way.We don't have to do this. We know these mountains -- they don't. If we can get ahead --We've got to try something. Think we'll get a finder's fee after they get all their \"luggage\"?That's not what really worries me.Yeah. Once they've got what they're after -- they're gonna need a copter to get out of here.I'll need the ice axe.Okay. How about some tape?Crampons too.Jesus.I've got a better idea. Why don't you come up and get it?Come on --A steambath. A steambath -- and a bottle of whiskey. A steambath with a bottle of Glenlivet. And a fire. A steambath -- with a bottle of Glenlivet -- and a steak. A steak soaked with Glenlivet, cooking over a steambath on fire.Sorry, Gordon -- I promise I'll have it back tomorrow.Please still be there -- oh, please --Mmm. Just like -- chicken.Come on -- wait till you're out of range -- don't pull it yet --Don't worry. You will.I didn't need to see that. I really didn't.Should've taken that left turn at Albequerque.It's just like any other side move -- you can't see where the fuck you're going, that's all --Much better.So much for the easy part.Come on --Here.Today, goddamit!This way. I like the outside of the mountain better too, but --Stop.I need to stop.I'm glad to see you -- but Christ, I wish you hadn't come.Try it from this side. Do you still have your radio?Let's give it a try. I'm in bad need of a ride. Come in, Rescue Unit ---- Come in, Rescue One ---- Come in, Frank --Is there anybody else on the radio?I take a year off and the department goes to hell. -- Come in, Rescue Unit --Come in, Frank -- over --Are you all right?No -- there could be another bomb up there -- even if there isn't, we could get another cave-in. The only sure way out is through the side.Come on -- we're almost out.Move!Knock this in the side. Make it firm.Bad news. There's another bomb up there. We've got to move quick.Good news. There's a cave down there.Die. I'm sorry, Maggie. I'm sorry you got into this.Forget about it. He can't hear you. Tie these together. Tight.This is rope from the Gordon exhibit. The way guys climbed then, they'd tie on three at a time -- this rope'll take around nine hundred pounds.Yeah, they made it pretty good then. Each of these strands ought to hold about 300 pounds before snapping.Depends on how big a breakfast you had. You want to go first?Swing towards it -- and drop!Are you okay?This. That plane crash -- it's a half dozen guys who were smart enough to steal fifty million bucks, but dumb enough to drop it all over the range. They've got Hal as a bird dog -- and right now they're heading for the rest of it.It's close to the lake -- Hal's probably leading them on the slowest possible route down to it. I can get there first -- all I have to do is make it along the north wall to the Bitker ladder --Something -- subtle.No way. You're climbing back down -- try to get to the station or find some help.And you're definitely not going --Okay. Come on ---- but the second you slow me down, I'm leaving -- -- I'm leaving you behind. Understood?If I don't go first, I might not go at all.Think you can beat my time?Shit -- she is in better shape.Quit sandbagging it -- I haven't got all day --That -- tears it. You're not coming any further.Maybe. But I'm not getting you killed. Look, Maggie. I don't know what'll happen when I catch up with Hal -- but I've got to know one thing for sure -- that you're making it off this mountain. Alive.Get on the trail and stay out of sight. I'll see you on the ground.Hasn't gotten any lower in the last year. Bitker, you cheap bastard. Would another four feet have killed you?Good thing for Qualen you are.When he comes back, he's going to shoot you and the other guy, grab the money, and take off with Travers.He already blew up one of your pals in that crevice. And I've been in that copter. It goes a hell of a lot farther with two people than with four. Am I wrong? Give him a buzz.You've also got all the money. And I can show you how to get off the mountain with it. Right now.It's right over there.It's a storage locker for the rangers. Everything you need to get off the mountain is in there -- skiis, food -- I'll show you --We'd make better time walking straight ahead. Qualen's not going to be hopping down the bunny trail too much longer.Don't fuck up. You still need me to show you a route off the mountain.Not any more.Didn't care for the Smokey The Bear hats, either. That's why I quit. You all right?Hardly seems worth zipping, huh? Frank?May I? They can't talk right now, Travers. Kristel's busy making snow angels -- and I'm not sure, but I think Qualen is still falling. Any messages?Maggie --I've got the money. Fly to the lake. And if you touch her --I have no fucking idea. Empty.Why can't anything be easy?Stay over there ---- what, throw snowballs at him? Just -- whatever happens -- get Maggie out of here.Thanks for asking. I forgot how much I enjoyed rescue work.Remember that bet you made? About whether I could find the money for you or not? You won.You do, and the spring thaw's going to be worth thirty million bucks. No rush. I'm sure you've got lots of time.When she's safe on the ground.Run! Run!Now come and get it. My arm's getting tired.Don't you want to count it?Don't spend it all in one place, you son of a bitch.Cheer up. It's a beautiful spot to die.Forget it. No fucking way. I'm staying right here.

What the fuck is this about?There isn't a hell of a lot anyone can do but observe. This is the most protected shipment we've got -- and the most useless for a thief. Those bills aren't in circulation. You think five thousand dollar bills are easy to pass? Who the fuck would try?Who is he?Could you get to the part where I'm supposed to care?Thanks for the tip. But I've got work to do.You have my sympathy, but -- There's a reason we do things this way, all right? Armored cars can be hijacked. Trains can be derailed. But nobody can get to us in flight. The only time this is on the ground is at the mint, or on the Presidio runway in San Francisco. Either way, someone would have to shoot his way past a couple of thousand guards.If you're worried about an inside job, forget it. I checked the plane from top to bottom an hour ago. And these three are my best against. Even if one of them did go skydiving, they wouldn't get far. Each case has an electronic tracer with a range of one hundred miles.I haven't lost a bill in eight years. And I'm not scrubbing this shipment because you scare easily.Stay put! Don't panic, goddammit!No -- we're going too fast, and we're too high up. Push flaps forward twenty degrees and drop to five thousand feet.What the hell are you doing --Calm down -- give the gun to me --He's losing it --Don't make me laugh.Move into position.More -- more -- keep it coming --Locked on. Move into lateral position.So what. He'll sift though a plane that went down in a storm -- -- find enough pulverized bone for six men heroically killed in the line of duty -- -- and just enough of the right kind of ash.We get twenty-one gun funerals and they write off fifty million. It's perfect, as long as you hold the plane steady -- so concentrate.On my way.That charge is going to blow both engines -- the plane'll go down like a rock, so clip yourself on to the end of the cable with the money as soon as I get over. And make sure you bring the right cases.Dip the plane. I'm coming over.Somehow, I didn't think you'd have waited for me if I'd sent it first.Get underneath the jet! The cases will slide over!Lower! Get underneath it!Now -- we call the police.Have they arrived? Good. Return to the plane and cover your tracks.Where?You said \"we\". Where are the rest?What's for dinner? Ugh. \"Dried Beef Slices With Barbeque Sauce.\" Try and make this edible.Hal Tucker. Where's yours?Gabe Walker... Very attractive.Too bad. Let me tell you what's on for today. We'd like you to help settle a wager. You see, we lost some luggage --See these? Now I've bet the gentlemen behind you that you know enough about this mountain range to lead us to each of these, quickly, and that you'd be happy to do so. They bet me you couldn't and wouldn't. Now tell me -- who wins?Good dog. Now let's get this expedition started.Okay. Connect the dots.Hold it. It's up there.Fetch.You've got to be kidding.Where could he go?You win. Kill him when he gets down.Lower it down -- now!Get him!We can't. And he knows it.Get us out of here.No tricks, no procedural codes, no personal messages -- just tell them everything's under control and you're taking care of the wounded.Have her come up.Good. You might live longer than your friend. Now -- -- what?It looks like a winding route.Is this it?Good. Get out of the way.This way.It's over here!He's still alive. He's still alive! He can't be far away -- spread out!Put your hands on your head.Still interested in staying alive?Show me.\"End of the line\"? That's classic. You've got style. So, I'm going to give you a three-count to figure out how to turn the safety off.Time to --No such luck. Cheer up. Everyone should die in a spot this beautiful.Forget about it. He's smart, but he's not invisible.I thought you said there was an easy way across.Don't be. Lead on.Look -- this part is nothing, believe me --Then get the money, kill him and get back here. Now.Don't tell me --What happened?Thanks. We couldn't have killed him without you.There's our ride out of here. Everyone out of sight -- except you, Kristel. Make the distress call. You're so good at it.Answer that.I almost believed you myself.Time for number three. Unless you want to have a longer conversation with him elsewhere.Suit yourself. You see, we just had a little interface with several branches of the federal government -- one of whose members I know has zero imagination -- and I can tell you, the cavalry just isn't going to make it by this week. No, you're taking us where we want to go. Because you want to return that favor and you want to do more than watch. You want to kill me -- more than anything, even more than you want to keep on breathing, and with a little more time you pray you'll get that chance. Am I right?Qualen. How far along are you?We have less than half a tank of fuel, Eric -- if we burn it up treasure hunting we'll never get off this rock. Now -- how far away are you?Time we have -- Walker's dead, Wright's an idiot. And our guide --As soon as he becomes a convenience instead of a necessity -- kill him.Have you found the money?He's hiding twenty yards in -- be careful.He's right behind you!Something's moving fast down the hill -- is it Tucker?Answer me! Is it Tucker?Hop in. I know someone who'd like to see you again before he dies.Qualen -- Kristel -- come in --You wanted to make a trade earlier, Walker -- still interested?I'll kill her --All right.
