{"Body-of-Evidence": {"CARDENAS": {"raw_line": "Is it Marsh?Who found him?She was here?Show me.How long?Cause?Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas. You arrived at what time tonight?Why did you come by?Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?Her name?You wouldn't know her address, would you?Thank you.What'd he die of?The official cause?But there's more?What are you saying, Henry? That his girlfriend fucked him to death?What can we prove?Any prints on the nasal spray?Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?What did he say about Miss Lawson?So she knew about his heart?What about the will?Miss Lawson?I'm District Attorney, John Cardenas.I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?Did I say it was a natural death?How?Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?Did you use it the night Marsh died?Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.Sit down, Frank.Fine.I don't think the handcuffs will be necessary. You can finish giving Miss Lawson her rights outside.Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will. That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death. That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.Take your pole out of the water, Frank. The fish ain't biting today.She planned this. She wanted us to find the nasal spray.Because she's clever. Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use. Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning. We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.We're going all the way on this one, Frank. Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.Then she's not as smart as I thought she was. You've seen her in the depositions. Tell me you don't have any doubts?Aren't they all?You all can see the defendant, Rebecca Lawson. But as this trial proceeds you will see that she is not only the defendant -- she is the murder weapon itself.Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?What induced it?So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?Then how did it get into his body?Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A. Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?Thank you, Doctor McCurdy. Your witness.Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?He did everything he could to take care of his heart?Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?Just one last question. What does the sign on your office door say?How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary?Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?What about Miss Lawson?Tell the court about that, please.Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?How did he look?Did you talk about Miss Lawson?What did Mr. Marsh say?Thank you. Your witness.The State calls Doctor Alan Paley.Where did you meet Miss Lawson?Did you ever see her again after that?What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?Why?What kind of information?Did you suggest any?What did she say?-- And what did you suggest?Your witness.Objection. Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from. Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?What did they argue about?Did they argue the day before he died?What was the nature of the argument?Could you be more specific?Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?Your witness.Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs Crawford's educational background has to do with this case.Objection, Your Honor. The fact that Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesn't mean the incident never happened.Your Honor -- please!I'm surprised you can walk after the way Burnham chewed your ass out this afternoon.Hey -- the bell's sounded. It's between rounds.What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here. This has become personal to you.You're sleeping with her, aren't you?I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her. She'll spit you out when this is over.Really? What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?Her. It's an obvious move. I'm building a case against her, remember?If your head wasn't up your ass you would have thought of it too. You're losing perspective. Get out while you can -- before she takes you down with her.The State calls Jeffery Roston.The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?How long were you together?How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?What kind of condition are you referring to?What happened next?And how are you now?How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?Why not?Why did she say she was leaving?Why do you think she left you?Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months. I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?Can you give the court an example?What would she do that made it hard to resist?What did she say?Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.What did she do next, Mr. Roston?If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?What happened after that?Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?Who was your primary beneficiary?Thank you. The State rests.Objection!Objection! Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.No questions.Objection! May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.Objection, Your Honor.Whether or not Miss Braslow uses drugs is not an issue here.It's true -- we all have fires burning inside us. Rebecca Lawson was very aware of the fire burning inside Andrew Marsh -- and she stoked those flames -- fanning them until they burned so hot that reason and judgement left him. Is making love a crime? Of course not -- but the question isn't as simple as that. Rebecca Lawson used her seductive qualities to entice Andrew Marsh. She used sex as a catalyst and cocaine as the terminus. The combination of the two provided the conclusion of a premeditated act. She asked Dr. Paley about cocaine. Her fingerprints were found on the nasal spray bottle that contained the cocaine -- and she was the sole beneficiary of Andrew Marsh's will. She planned it from beginning to end. She knew about his heart. She secretly administered cocaine, then used wild and physically demanding sex to induce a heart attack. Making love is an act of passion between two people to affirm their vows of love. This was not an act of love -- this was an act of greed. This was betrayal. Rebecca Lawson killed Andrew Marsh -- and I'm counting on you to punish her for that crime.Paley's confessed to the whole thing. It's like he's got no will to live now that she's gone. She almost got away with it. Ironic, huh? Do you believe in karma, Frank?Well -- call it what you want. Fate. Destiny. We usually get what we deserve in the end.You get his statement?Then you can go.Frank?I found this video in her room. It has your name on it.I assume it's yours.", "clean_line": "marsh long cause miss braslow district attorney john cardenas arrived time tonight come know mr marsh wouldn know address thank die official cause saying henry girlfriend fucked death prove prints nasal spray rebecca lawson scene miss lawson knew heart miss lawson district attorney john cardenas wanted introduce inform miss lawson inquiry starters like know left house report death natural death miss lawson use cocaine use night marsh died aware mr marsh heart condition mr marsh cardiologist nurse told accompanied mr marsh office occasions sit frank fine think handcuffs necessary finish giving miss lawson rights outside marsh left close million dollars motive admits night death opportunity fingerprints nasal spray bottle pole water frank fish ain biting today planned wanted nasal spray clever knows suspicions man marsh condition use cocaine report stated marsh nasal membranes showed sign prior cocaine use nasal spray treated poisoning looked motive trail led going way frank tell client prelim cop plea murder smart thought ve seen depositions tell doubts aren defendant rebecca lawson trial proceeds defendant murder weapon doctor mccurdy cause death mr marsh physical condition prior death heart attack result natural causes induced mr marsh cocaine body bottle nightstand honor state enters evidence exhibit fingerprints bottle dr mccurdy cocaine mr marsh condition midst making love influence cocaine effect secretly administered cocaine mr marsh induced love thank doctor mccurdy witness doctor trammel diagnose mr marsh heart disease mr marsh change lifestyle care heart miss lawson accompany mr marsh office question sign office door long mr marsh personal secretary mr marsh use cocaine miss lawson tell court mr marsh day death look talk miss lawson mr marsh thank witness state calls doctor alan paley meet miss lawson eventually happened relationship miss lawson kind information suggest suggest witness objection honor know tape circumstances mrs crawford mr marsh maid years miss lawson mr marsh argue argue argue day died nature argument specific mr marsh use cocaine witness honor fail mrs crawford educational background case objection honor fact mrs crawford heard mr troxell reconstruct sentence decided rephrase words intelligent manner court mean incident happened honor surprised walk way burnham chewed ass afternoon hey bell sounded rounds happening frank acting like trial personal sleeping aren talking friend ruin life career ll spit attorney speak client house clock morning obvious building case remember head wasn ass thought losing perspective takes state calls jeffery roston state investigation uncovered mr roston yesterday afternoon chicago honor mr roston ex lover miss lawson away extended vacation returned days ago mr roston relationship miss lawson long sex life miss lawson know personal subject little specific kind condition referring happened relationship miss lawson progress surgery leaving think left honor mr roston lived defendant months feel opinion valid substantiating character miss lawson miss lawson indication leaving sexual relations miss lawson intense exactly mean court example hard resist mr roston know difficult important tell court mr roston knew bad happened change miss lawson primary beneficiary thank state rests objection objection mr roston sexual preferences issue trial questions objection remind mr dulaney person trial miss lawson dr paley objection honor miss braslow uses drugs issue true fires burning inside rebecca lawson aware burning inside andrew marsh stoked flames fanning burned hot reason judgement left making love crime course question isn simple rebecca lawson seductive qualities entice andrew marsh sex catalyst cocaine terminus combination provided conclusion premeditated act asked dr paley cocaine fingerprints nasal spray bottle contained cocaine sole beneficiary andrew marsh planned beginning end knew heart secretly administered cocaine wild physically demanding sex induce heart attack making love act passion people affirm vows love act love act greed betrayal rebecca lawson killed andrew marsh counting punish crime paley confessed thing like got live gone got away ironic huh believe karma frank want fate destiny usually deserve end statement frank video room assume"}, "DULANEY": {"raw_line": "I am relaxing.Really?And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?I'm always open to learning new things.I'm beginning to see what you mean. Why don't we go upstairs and work on the advanced course?Can't it wait?Hey, Slugger. Ready for bed?Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye. That was Sattler. He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson. He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.I know. What can I do? He is the boss.What are they saying?Hey, you know better than that. What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?Some example you set.Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.I'm supposed to be on vacation.Why?Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.Alright, I'll talk to herI think the question is: What is it about her that made him want to do it?Miss Lawson, I'm Frank Dulaney.There are no charges against you. I'm here to decide if I'm going to represent you should that occur. Did you kill him?I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.Not a very good one I'm afraid.You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.You still haven't answered my question.He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.I don't know yet. I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.Attractive. Bright. Distant. Charming when she wants to be.Yeah -- but can she cook?HumpedI can think of worse ways to go----and speaking of humping.She's not denying she was there.She just said that.That's something only Marsh would know.That's it. My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.No. Miss Lawson came in here voluntarily to answer your questions. She doesn't have to sit here and be insulted. So, either you charge her now or we're leaving.I'll have you out in a few hours.Lookin' to make the papers, John?You can't show intent.Can you?You're bluffing. John, it's me, remember? I've known you since your name was Juan Carlos.C'mon -- think about it. If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?Why would she want that?Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.I don't buy it and neither will a jury.I'll tell her but she won't take it.She's innocent.Yeah. Well -- we'll let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that.I want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty. Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud. They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path.This is a very small town -- people here have very straight views on sex.Those same men will be sitting on the jury.No pain, no gain?We're not animals.I think we're getting a little off the subject here.As it pertains to you -- not me. Did you always know you had different... tastes?How?Why not?Try.If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?I'll talk to him later.Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.I'm sorry if it looks like I'm not paying attention to you lately.You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends? How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?Well, that's kind of how I am right now.Yeah -- a little.I love you.Fine, Charlie. You familiar with the Marsh case?It could've happened to anyone.We have to find out who else would profit from Marsh's death -- and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal.I want you to hit all the dealers in town. Give them a list of people close to Marsh and see if any of them use. Then I want you to check out a Doctor Alan Paley. He lives up in Roseburg.Hi... No, I don't... One o'clock is fine... Alright La Brasa... Bye.I'm taking a client to lunch. Where should I go, Taco Bell?How'd you meet Marsh?-- And then?Why didn't you live together?Sure. Where to?This is your house.I don't think this is a good idea.Because, I'm your attorney. I shouldn't be going to your house.No -- it just doesn't look right.I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.Oh -- Well, they're different.It's not my taste.Nothing.Yes you were.Yeah -- fine. Excuse me. I'll be right back.Hi. It's Frank.I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.Great. I'll see you at the office at nine.Yeah.It's okay.Tell me about Doctor Paley?It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.Yeah.I broke my ankle skating. That ended that dream.What would?Is that what you think I was thinking?You take a lot for granted.You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.The Beaver State.What changed?You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you?I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?How do you know what kind of sex they had?Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?What about Miss Lawson?How do you know that?What? No -- nothing. Thank you for your time.You lied to me!I just left Joanne Braslow. She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!That's not good enough, Goddamit!No, I don't have to believe you. The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.Why would she lie?Michael -- get off the phone.Because I'm expecting a call.I know what day it is! Get off the phone.I called you all weekend. Where were you?Alone?I know what you're thinking -- and it's a mistake. You look at Miss Lawson and you see a beautiful woman who was involved with an older man -- and you think she looks like the type. She could've done it. And that's exactly what the District Attorney wants you to think. Yes, she is beautiful. So what? Does that make her a killer? Of course not. This case is not about appearances. It's about facts. As Mr. Cardenas presents his case you will see that there are very few facts -- that the bulk of the States evidence is circumstantial. I'm confident that by the conclusion of this trial you will not just have a reasonable doubt. You will have no doubt at all -- that Rebecca Lawson is innocent of the charges against her.Can you say with any certainty that Mr. Marsh didn't ingest the cocaine himself?That's your opinion, Doctor -- but I'm asking you if there is any scientific test that can tell who actually put the cocaine into the Dristan bottle?Thank you.Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile?So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving. That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights. Incredible stress.So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love? That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him. That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.Well, think about it. Isn't it possible?It's only the beginning.Can I see you later?What are you doing?Paley could be a problem tomorrow.I'm glad you have such confidence in me.What does that mean? You've been thinking about the case? Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?I'm sorry. Rebecca -- I'm sorry. Really.Honey.Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?If necessary I can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence.And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine. I would like to play it now.These are reports from two independent audio labs. They each state that the voices were recorded over the phone and that no alterations have been made.You'll be sorry?You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?I suggest it never happened.No further questions.That's all Dr. Paley.What the... What are you doing?Rebecca -- take these off.What are you going you doing?Rebecca -- please. No more.Yeah -- what are you doing up?What's wrong?Sharon, it's late. Can we get to the point?Working. Charlie and I were going over some statements.Yes.Because I knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking.I'm not.No.Sharon...Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?High school?I was just about to make my point, Your Honor.\"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities.\" Who told you to say that?Did Mr. Troxell help you with that phrase?Then -- those are not your own words?What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.No, Your Honor.I've got work to do.I didn't hear it.Back off, John.That's ridiculous.You don't know what you're talking about.You've been following me?You got something on the coke?If you want to get your kicks go to a video store and rent a porno movie.Over what?So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?Why?Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that.I need to speak with you.You were sleeping with Marsh.He video taped you.I thought he was a kind, gentle man?You're lying. Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape. It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson. He dumped you for her, didn't he?It must have been horrible. Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow.Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.But Your Honor--Objection. The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.The opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view.Objection. The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.Mr. Roston, you said it was the best sex you ever had. Is that the best sex with a woman, or a man?I'll rephrase the question. Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?Your Honor, I'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was.Mr. Roston?And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?And she left shortly after that?Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?No further questions.What's that for?Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.He was only doing what he thought was right.You killed him -- didn't you?You don't need anybody.I'm dropping the case.You're a monster.I'll get it.You got something on the Coke?Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon?Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?Why does she come to you?Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?What did you prescribe for her?Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?How do you instruct your patients to take it?A previous witness stated that she saw Miss Lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on October twenty-eighth. According to your records when did you prescribe the drug?One last question, Doctor. If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?Your witness.The defense calls Miss Margaret Sellers.Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?Where did you meet him?What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.Then what happened?-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?Did he make your life miserable?How?Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.What did he say?Do you remember his exact words?What happened next?What happened?Joe Koehler. I know him. He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.Not this will.Here it is! According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing. Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend.Drug store.Yes, Your Honor. The defense recalls Joanne Braslow.How often do you use cocaine?Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.I can back it up.You've tried it? Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along. Isn't that true?You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?--and that he changed his will?In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out. Why do you think he did that?Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money. That must have made you pretty angry?You testified that you returned to Mr. Marsh's house at eleven o'clock the night of his murder. Is that correct?Well - I'm a little confused. This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account. It's dated the day of the murder. Is this your signature?There's an item you picked up that's marked. Will you read it?Would you read for us the time of the purchase?A.M -- or P.M.?You see that's what bothers me. No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house. The police looked. There was only the one bottle. But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death. How do you think it got there?Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?Because you were jealous. Because he cut you out of the will. Because you have a cocaine habit to feed -- because you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void -- and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored.The defense rests.I know.I can't talk about it now.You wouldn't like what you'd see. You don't know me anymore. I don't know me anymore.Please -- not now.I don't know.It's more involved than that.You think that's the answer? Sex? Is that what you want? You want me to make love to you?Is this what you want -- huh? Is it?Oh -- Jesus.I'm sorry. God -- I'm so sorry.Help me. Please -- help me.The Prosecution's case is built on theory -- speculation. Could Rebecca Lawson have done this? Is it possible that she did that? Where are the facts? The evidence. The State has presented two spurned lovers and a jealous secretary. Hardly what I would call impartial witnesses. Where is one shred of conclusive, irrefutable evidence? I don't see it -- and I don't think you do either. Do you know why? Because there isn't any.It's human nature. We want what we want -- when we want it. We don't think about the consequences of our actions. When desire fills us we all do things that we know are bad for us. We live for the moment. Here was an exciting young woman who unlocked doors. Doors that led into a new world. A world he entered willingly -- eagerly. He wanted to please her -- and so, he did not tell her of his illness. I know it might be difficult for you to understand wanting something so badly that you are willing to risk everything -- but that's what passion does to you. It's a fire -- uncontrollable. It consumes you -- and the only thing you can do is let it burn. Andrew Marsh let it burn. It was his life - - his choice -- and maybe his mistake -- but making love is not a crime. We all have fires inside us -- secret desires. We guard them --hold them in the cages that we've built. When someone comes along and opens the gate, they rush out and feed blindly on their pleasure. Rebecca Lawson loved Andrew Marsh. She didn't kill him -- if anything did, it was his own passion.They're back already? It's only been three hours.Take some time off.I don't know.You did a good job, Charlie.Then you would have gotten your money?You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?What do you have in your purse?Why'd you come here?You didn't know about it before that?Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler in the first place?Hi, Joe.I need to ask you a question. What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?I'm not asking for names or specifics. I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?Please -- I need your help.Hello?I'll be right there.Rebecca?You killed him. You killed him -- and I got you off.Is it? Joanne Braslow was perfect, wasn't she? You knew we'd see her on the tape and find out about her coke problem. After that, the digging should have been easy -- but we missed the will. You knew we were following her, so you called Koehler and had him contact her. That put us right back on track. All we needed then was to prove that she had an opportunity. The drug store took care of that. She dropped off the stuff and you came back and killed him. Didn't you?I want the tape.That wasn't the deal.I'm not leaving without that tape.You fuckin' bitch!She's right, Paley. You've got to kill me. She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her. You supplied the Coke. You're an accessory to murder.Don't you see what she's doing? She needs you to kill me. She's planned it that way from the start. That's why she phoned me tonight.How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me. After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in. That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?Here's the good part. The truth dies with me and she turns State's evidence against you. It won't matter what you say. No one will believe your version -- you've already discredited yourself in court. You'll go away forever and she'll have the money all for herself. She's played us both perfectly.She's good isn't she? But maybe with you it's the real thing. I'm sure all those nights she was fuckin' me she was thinking of you.I'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked.I mean she only screwed me two or three times a night because she had to -- I'm sure she didn't enjoy it.That's right, she loves you. Just like she loved Roston and Marsh and me. Don't be a fool. You're nothing to her. The second you pull that trigger she'll turn on you.Can I go?Thanks.", "clean_line": "relaxing suppose going relax open learning new things beginning mean upstairs work advanced course wait hey
