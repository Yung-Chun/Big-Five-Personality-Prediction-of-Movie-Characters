{"Dave-Barrys-Complete-Guide-to-Guys": {"DAVE": {"raw_line": "Hi, I'm Dave Barry. Has something like this ever happened to you? (bends down to petScientists call this condition \"Lust Induced Brain Freeze.\" It affects millions of guys, every day, in all walks of life -- causing anything from a mild embarrassment, to an international incident. He stops. Finds LEOPOLD and STEARNS and SEVERAL OTHER AGENTS pointing GUNS at him.Hey. I didn't even know it was a dog. They take it from him; rush it away. Dave turns to CAMERA.Notice I didn't say it's a condition that affects men every day -- only guys. And that subtle but important difference is one of the things this movie is about.Now clearly, this woman is dealing with a Man.Whereas Guys aren't capable of doing anything like what you just saw. Guys are more like this:When did you first suspect?Here in Miami.Like a lot of big cities, Miami is known for its sizeable population of guys. So we came here to take the city's pulse on the subject.I see.So, if you were to meet someone that was funny and responsible...In what way?So now you have some background on basic guy attributes. But before we move on, let's look at one more scene and see where you stand --If this was how you responded, you're not a guy. You may not even exist. On the other hand...And what about men.So it all works out.So where did this all start? Many experts now think they know where men came from, but what about Guys? where did they come from? He stops, peels off a THICK BOOK full of science things.To answer this question accurately, we might have to look something up. So instead we'll travel back to prehistoric sub-Saharan Africa, and get there just in time for the Dawn of Guys.There's a whole list of things a guy is supposed to discuss first. Unfortunately, he never knows what they are until he's already not discussed them.To a girl it's a pain in the butt. But to a guy - some things just come naturally...There's a very simple reason why guys don't ask for directions. It's because they know that if they do, someone else - most likely Visigoths - will come and steal their woman. CAMERA PANS to the side rails, where a CLUSTER OF HUNGRY VISIGOTHS nod, slobbering, confirming this.In learning to understand Guys today, it's important to remember that these same guys, only yesterday, were just kids.See? Humans. He walks past with his takeout order. As ELAINE at 8 notices Roger, blushing, taking all this punishment because of her.Where are we in the area of Guy Violence, Doctor.And what can be done about that.Then what would you recommend.I meant about Guy Violence.I see. Can I ask you a question?Where'd you get that laser pointer.A lot of work has been done in the field of children's toys and how they unconsciously reinforce gender roles. Studies have found that over ninety-three per cent of this work is done by researchers who don't have children of their own. But to test the theory anyway, we're here at Toy World Warehouse Planet.Hi! My friend here is looking for toys for his son that are gender neutral, environmentally sound, and culturally unbiased!Well no, if loud is your --So when we see guys like Ed, and his fireworks - or guys shooting marine flares into innocent pumpkins, or building catapults that'll throw a Buick - we should not condemn them. We should not assume these are just pointless juvenile activities. Instead we should be convinced they are, and move on to Guys in the Workplace.And how long would that take.A lot of people don't understand the attention and the kind of importance these jokes have.No one knows that.A lot has been said about how guys don't share their feelings.(as they agree onSo you agree then, that guys at least have feelings.Believe it or not, ladies - that was sharing. And believe it or not, guys - so isRoger met Elaine at a company event.-- They discovered they had something in common right away. He points to ROGER and ELAINE, over by a tiki-torch.She loved that he remembered that.A few nights later, he asked her out. He points over to the LANE where they're bowling.They had a good time, and so he asked her again. And then before too long they were seeing each other regularly, and not seeing anyone else.Roger has no idea that this was a defining moment for her. Roger gets in. Fuzzy but not sure why.Roger's in love.Do you have any advice for a guy in love?I see.What happens then.Contrary to what many women believe, it's fairly easy to develop a long term, stable, intimate and mutually fulfilling relationship with a guy. As long as this is the guy:With human guys, it's extremely difficult. This is because guys don't really grasp what women mean by the term 'relationship.'I think it's obvious here, that Roger has absolutely no idea what he's talking about. But Guy Pride forces him to keep acting like he does know, for reasons I believe we've covered in an earlier scene. He nods his head over to the corner, where the CAMERA PANS TO SEE HUDDLED VISIGOTHS, WAITING. Then BACK TO ROGER AND ELAINE as the PICTURE UNFREEZES.As far as women are concerned, God didn't really rest on the seventh day. On the seventh day, God created Steve. As the Women all sigh...Just because Steve can fix things, doesn't mean he's shallow and doesn't have any concerns. All guys have concerns. Deep concerns.Hell yeah. Steve gives him a look. Turns on the radio.Meaningless? Mike the Moose looks at him.But that's true. They look over - see him on the counter.It's true that the level of concern a guy shows for his team can affect the outcome of the game. I mean not just one guy - but lots of guys. All the guys who care about the team combined, if they really care, can make a difference on the scoreboard.-- Follow me.For the first time ever, through the use of highly advanced technology, we will be able to see the actual Concern Rays emanating from the minds of Roger and Gene, in their attempt to affect the outcome of this upcoming - and totally critical - foul shot.These Concern Rays go straight into the television screen where they join the combined Concern Rays of all the other guy fans watching this game right now.Then the rays are transmitted to the actual arena itself, all arriving at the same moment regardless of any geographic or time zone differences.And it is here, at the arena, where the combined Concern Rays from both teams' fans will be measured - not just for quantity, but for quality. Because this - as every Guy must believe - is what wins ball games.If there's one thing women don't know about when it comes to guys, it's the public rest room problem. And we're here to clear that up right now. He stops outside a MEN'S REST ROOM, which is currently closed for maintenance.This room is a private hell for a countless number of guys -- yet the women in their lives are completely in the dark about it.But before we go inside, let's talk with a leading social scientist, so that what we're about to show you sounds a little more official.I see.Um...you were saying?With me now is the great John Madden -- legendary coach of football's Oakland Raiders and veteran network analyst for CBS Sports and now the Fox Sports Network. John, thanks for coming by today.John, you heard what our leading expert said about this particular anxiety that guys have regarding bathrooms in general and public ones in particular. Any thoughts?So an airport bathroom presents a specific kind of challenge.Couldn't agree more, John. Let's goHere's our first candidate now --What's the main thing we're looking for, John. What does each individual guy feel he needs to get out of this.Obvious indeed. Now here comes Guy Number Two -- The SECOND GUY comes in; John diagrams the call.What about eye contact in this situation.Okay. Now if things stay like this...Which brings us to Guy Number Four. Here he comes --Now one thing that I know we're going to get asked, John, especially from women, is whether, as guys, we're aware of how utterly stupid this kind of behavior really is.I think we do.We did that.If there's anything that causes more anguish in a guy than sports anguish, and public restroom anguish, and hardware store anguish, it's the day that he realizes that somehow his life is half over now, and no matter what he tries to tell himself, he's not young anymore and he's never going to be young again. And as any guy'll tell you - it sucks.That sounds pretty bleak.Okay! Well it looks like it's time to talk about sex.Will you knock it off?For the sake of any younger viewers who might still be paying attention, during this next segment we will be using certain euphemisms to describe a natural and wonderful thing that happens among grownups - grownups besides your parents, that is.Probably the fastest growing sector of the U.S. economy is the sector that conducts surveys asking womenwhat is wrong with men. And in all those surveys, there is one main area that shows up constantly at the top of the charts. (he stops, pulls awhen I say \"euphemisms,\" I of course am not suggesting that guys don't have them. Guys have plenty of euphemisms. Most guys have more euphemisms in a single day - and here I am thinking of a day that occurred in the summer between ninth and tenth grades - than some women have in a lifetime - or longer, in the case of certain Math Teachers.It all goes back to a time, millions of years ago, when primitive males often had to complete their part of the equation quickly and right away stand ready to fight off attackers.Today, however, women want euphemisms too -- and this ability in males is no longer as prized as it once was.In fact, when modern women describe the qualities they're looking for in the ideal man, the phrase \"a real fast shooter\" is usually pretty far down the list.one technique for holding back the inevitable, is when the guy - just when he is about to have his euphemism - will hurl himself violently into an iron bed railing, and raise a lump on his head the size of a golf ball.In cases where there aren't any iron railings, a good backup technique can be found right on the end of the cold wet nose of the trusted family dog. CAMERA PANS to the window where we hear:There are also mental techniques --One of the most time honored and reliable mental delaying styles, is the Baseball Method -- -- how's it going, Champ. Roger pokes his head out of the blanket; stays active from the neck down.And that did the trick.Really? You mean like if a train leaves Chicago at one o'clock and another train leaves Denver at two o'clock and they're going at different speeds?As you can see, a lot of guys are making a tremendous effort here - and yet, according to certain standards they are still, basically, lame as hell on almost every single count. The reason for this is simple: women set the standards. And not just bedroom standards -- all standards. Because women invented standards. Remember the Dawn of Guys?This is basically where we stand today. The only difference is, we have way more standards. There are social standards, about being sensitive - remembering anniversaries, listening during conversations, not eating soup with your hands, or sitting around in your underwear when company's over.-- And there are thousands of standards for domestic life, involving even more totally un-guy concepts -- like curtains, bedspreads, napkins, special hangers, little soaps shaped like fruit, and decorative boxes that hold tissues that already come in a box. While guys, left on their own in the wild, will develop lifestyles that don't involve any of these things.of course, even by the most basic standards, these two are living like savages. But they honestly don't know this -- because Guys, in their natural state, aren't any more aware of domestic standards than a trout would be aware of the stock market. And this causes women a lot of concern.Laundry's a big issue - and a deep and puzzling mystery to guys. My own wife Michelle, for instance, is an accomplished sportswriter and mother of an extremely young child, yet she is still able to maintain a vigorous clothes-cleaning regimen bordering on the super-human. And I'm not allowed near the stuff.These are clearly secret codes, that women intuitively understand but cannot adequately explain -- just like how a lot of guys understand the Infield Fly Rule, without being able to explain that.Because you're special, Sweetheart.So now that we've heard your thoughts. The frustration, the exasperation... the obvious question comes to mind: Why go through it? Why have guys in your life at all? They look at him.I think it's time for the conclusion now.Well now you know where things stand. You've learned a little bit about guys, and the critical roles they've played in the past and in modern society today. And for better or worse, they're here with us to stay -- so the best thing you can do about it, is continue to learn about them - by coming to see this movie lots and lots of times, and bringing more and more of your friends back every time you do. Because the more people that understand guys, the better for everyone. And the more people that -- (as the Lawyer launchesHey what do you know?

But we were both invited to the same party, by different people who we only knew marginally - only the party got cancelled, and I guess that's how marginal we were, because no one told us. So we came in different cars and found ourselves at the same front door - with no one home. So Gene asked me out to eat.You were in love. You told me you loved me, that first night!You were eating mashed potatoes. You said you loved me. You said because your name was Gene and mine was Kelly, that that just proved it. We were meant to be together.It'll be all right.Trust me, it'll all work out. After a while, there's no more harm they can do. Roger comes around from the side door. SLOSHING feet. Holds a dripping PART.And then they cover it all up with duct tape and then come out and say it's supposed to work that way.Not during the playoffs anyway.Who is he?I'm with you.

Why did I even think this would be a good idea -- to work my ass off every single day of my life? So I could come in here and dictate letters like this?And what does it get me -- a twin- turbo convertible that I don't even get to drive, because I'm always traveling and renting shitbox cars in other cities where all I do is take clients out to lunch and tell them how to negotiate their golden parachutes? You ever sit in the driver's seat of one of those renta cars?Brand new cars, not even two thousand miles on them, and already they drive like camels. The seat's got no cushion left already, and you're lucky if you don't need a chiropractor after twenty minutes in one. What do people do in those things?Yeah. I want something. I want the number of that hang-gliding place out on Route 33.I want to teach hang gliding.I don't do that. I want to do that. I've always wanted to do that, and lots of other things too -- only I'm stuck doing this all day long. And I don't even know what this is half the time, just that I have to spend every waking hour doing it.
