{"Hangover-The": {"VICK": {"raw_line": "Tracy, it's Vick. Parked on the dirt road behind Vick is his near-totalled 1967 Cadillac Deville convertible; it's scratched, dented, filthy - - and missing its passenger side door. Slouched inside are TWO OTHER GUYS, also looking like hell.Listen, honey...The bachelor party got a little out of control and, well...we lost Doug.Yeah, that's not gonna happen.Stu, relax, we're still on the 10.The one on the left is gonna be a hottie. The other one, not so much. Stu protectively snatches the photos back, muttering:Of course they are, Doug. Jesus, Alan's been dating Becky for 14 years. When they first met, Alan had braces and soccer hair, and Becky had a functioning hymen.Asking Alan if he's still with Becky is like asking the sun if it still rises in the east. The guys try not to laugh; Alan scowls.Oh, great. Yeah, I'm working on bringing the next big dessert craze to Los Angeles. It's gonna be huge.Bavarian custard. We ran the numbers, and it's gonna be bigger than fro yo. Doug and Stu nod, impressed; only Alan looks skeptical.Our plan is to open three stores in the Valley and then franchise it. Shares are selling fast, but I can probably squeeze you guys in...Tattoo-To-You was an idea ahead of it's time, Alan! And don't come crying to me when there's a Custard Cabana on every street corner in America and you didn't buy in--!Checking in. Lennon comma Victor. The man types into his computer.Hold it right there, Atashir. This is my best friend from childhood, Douglas Billings. In two days, he is to marry a woman of great beauty and strong teeth, do you understand? A woman of gigantic bosoms who will give him many, many sons... Atashir looks confused. Alan looks embarrassed.My two other childhood friends have travelled great distances, across many deserts, to be here. This isn't a night in a hotel for us, Atashir: this is a family reunion. Perhaps you too have family situated great distances away, in a foreign country with much sand? Atashir looks like, sort of...? Vick reaches over the counter and touches his arm, simpatico.Then I have but one question for you, friend: if they came to town, would you put them in an economy suite?Well, then. I think one of us needs to get back on his little computer and find us a suitable room. Atashir frowns...but types away at his computer.Dean-o will be fine. Send up a case of Cristal, two bottles of Patron, four ahi sandwiches, and a crate of skinless mangos... Vick turns to the guys:You guys want anything? The guys stammer, too stunned to speak.And have Jean-Marie cook up a dozen of those duck skewers I like so well. He knows the ones.American Express. Atashir looks up to accept the card. After a beat, Vick turns to Alan:Dude, give him your AmEx.Don't worry, we'll hit you later. Alan stammers.Dude, come on, I paid for gas. Stop being such a Jew. Alan stammers some more -- then angrily pulls out his card.Get dressed, ladies. We're wheels up in ten. Stu and Doug race off to find their bedrooms, leaving Alan standing alone, just staring at the decadent suite.This is Vick.He's in Vegas?! You're kidding me!I said all right, dude! How many more times you want me to say all right?!Boy Party in the bathrooooom--! Miner's cut, 2.6 Carats, slight pink tint, street value: 26, 27K. Vick studies it in the light. Alan just rubs his temples.Well gosh-golly, Alan Mervish, good for you! Where'd you get the ring?Check it out, Stu's already wasted. Vick starts refilling everyone's glasses.Jesus, what do you take us for?We'll be good tonight, Doug.Damn, dude, why are you retarded? Both men are ragingly hungover. A long beat as both of them rub their faces, then:Um, Stuey?Why do you have a mullet? Stu does, in fact, have a mullet haircut. But he's too hungover to understand.You know, business on top, party down the back? Stu still looks confused. This is excruciating for Vick.Your hair, dude. You have a mullet. Stu touches his hair. Then he stumbles into the bathroom. After a beat, we hear his voice:Get him up. I'm hungry. Stu disappears back into the bathroom. We hear the SHOWER turn on. Beat. Then we hear Alan slowly awaken:Jesus, dude, put away your sack. Alan looks down at his hairy nakedness, totally bewildered.We might not smell very good. The guys shake their heads, yeah, no.Please stop talking. If I don't focus on eating I'm going to throw up all over myself. The guys nod, right. They keep eating. After a long while:You gonna finish that cruller? Stu shakes his head, no. Vick takes it, packs it into his already stuffed mouth. Then Alan realizes:Probably left him in the room. Vick pulls out his cell phone, starts dialing.I'll call his cell. Then a phone RINGS in Stu's pocket. He answers:It's me, meatdick.No answer. Vick goes back to eating. Alan frowns.I'm eabing.Relax, it's Doug, he's probably crashed out on someone's couch right now. All we have to do is retrace our steps from last night, and we'll find him.Well, we started on the roof...Then...I think...we had steaks at the Palm?That sounds right... Stu throws up his arms, already giving up.I vaguely recall...doing body shots ....at some point? Is that...maybe?I think we went to the Flamingo after that...? And then, I just remember a lot of blue light...and the overpowering smell of baby oil.Give or take.Yes. Yes. Doug was with us. I tackled him...for some reason. The guys nod, okay, okay.The valet ticket says we returned here at 4:57AM.Why do we have a matchbook from The Golden Pony All Male Revue? The guys exchange a look, alarmed.Absolutely not.Of course you're with Alan, you're both gutless cowards. But we're not calling Tracy. You never call the bride from the bachelor party. Ever. If my balls were on fire and Tracy was sitting next door with a tall glass of water, I still wouldn't call her. It's a rule.She has a watch, she'll figure it out.And I think I'm beginning to see why you're always a douche--I can't believe we're doing this.Who's Roger?What do I think it means? Well, Stuart, your ass is all torn up and you're wearing thong underwear declaring your love for another dude -- I don't think we need the CSI team for this one! You got reamed last night, man! Stu covers his mouth, horrified!Look, I'm sure Roger is a very nice, considerate young man--Come on, Stu, you're nowhere near cool enough.But sort of...it does? Stu grows increasingly frantic.Um, what?Yeah, no you didn't.I think I'd remember, dude.Unbelievable.Please, you're so not his type!Look, Stu, one homosexual experience doesn't mean you're permanently gay, okay? A lot of guys test the waters. ...the FATHER and SON wheel right back around and exit.No! We're not gay!Quickly, and from a great distance. Alan's hand accidentally hits a brass railing and CLINKS...What now? Alan holds up the source of his CLINKING: on his ring finger is a huge, tacky, silver WEDDING RING with a unicorn on it.Oh my God... Oh my God...\"Now & Forever Wedding Chapel.\" They guys exchange a look.Well, at least it's a lead. Beat. Then Alan turns and THROWS UP all over the slot machine. Nearby OCTOGENARIAN SLOT PLAYERS look over, disgusted -- but continue playing their nickels.So, we go to the wedding chapel, we find out what we did with Doug, we recover him, and we're back in LA before sundown. Easy as Stu's ass. No one laughs. Tense SILENCE as they wait for the car.Guys, relax. Everything's gonna be cool... Just then the Valet drives up inI'm not emotionally prepared to talk about it just yet, Stuart, but thank you. Vick dons his sunglasses and heads for his destroyed car...Well, now you did. Just not to her. Alan glowers at the city going by... Then he sits up--Yeah, that was a different shirt. Alan doesn't look so sure. They drive in silence. Then:Left turn. Stu, sitting shotgun, braces against the empty doorframe so as not to fall out of the car as they turn left...Does the pope wear a funny hat?! Let's do this thing! Steve CACKLES and guides them over to a table; Alan scowls.Uh, it was such a lovely ceremony, wasn't it?Sadly, I believe you... The guys look at the photos of Alan's wedding from the night before. They're typical wedding shots, only the guys are all wearing MEDIEVAL COSTUMES, swords, bows, tights, even armor. They look incredibly happy -- and incredibly drunk. The next photo is of Alan and his BUSTY BLONDE BRIDE. She's having a blast in a white medieval gown and tiara.Hello, Chastity... Alan just closes his eyes, oh God.Stu, please, show some class. That's Alan's wife you're talking about.You can't put a pricetag on love, Alan! OW! You just can't!It's good to be seen, Carla. It's good to be seen.For you and Chastity to watch on your anniversary... Alan just clenches his jaw, I fucking hate you.And it looks like real velvet, Alan, so no machine wash, okay?Me too! Hey, can Stu and I get a shield?That's his girlfriend of 14 years. I'm sure this'll only take a minute...Yeah, did she ask about us?! Off of Alan's hate-filled glare, weTurns out Doug was in all the wedding photos, which means -- if the time stamp was right -- we had him in our possession until 11 pm.Hey, Steve, you don't happen to know where we were heading when we left here last night, do you?Your negativity is like a little black cloud over our car, Alan. You've got to let go of this.You're broke? I thought you wereAlan. Honey. Have you considered, even for a second, that maybe the things we do when we're drunk are what we secretly want to do?Or, after 14 years, maybe you don't have the balls to leave Becky, and this is your way of getting her to leave you.All the more reason to freak out. Alan opens his mouth to respond, but nothing comes out. Vick nods, chew on that, and continues slowly reversing the car.I love you, Alan Mervish, I do, but you've always had a major pole up your ass. Maybe last night was your inner cool person trying to get out-What the--?! They look up to see two MASSIVE SAMOAN MEN in loud Hawaiian shirts, KALOLO FANALUA and KIKIOLANI, 30's, standing on either side of the car. And they look pissed.Stu, please. I think there's been some sort of mistake, Mister...?Those so aren't their real names.Alan? Relax. These men aren't going to hurt us. They're from Hawaii.Okay, okay! Cool it with the bat! Jesus, why is everyone trying to kill my car...? Vick undoes his seatbelt and reaches for his door handle. Kikiolani lowers his bat -- and Vick throws the door open, right into his nuts! The huge Samoan staggers back, OWWW, and Vick slams his door shut andI honestly don't know how you two are still alive.No! No cops!Nothing! I just think we should focus on finding Doug and not get distracted by every little thing!Oh please, those guys are from Guam. Get a grip.Fine. Let's just go back to the hotel -- Doug is probably back from wherever he spent the night, we'll get him, we'll straighten out whatever we did to those angry Samoans, then we'll get the hell back to LA, okay? Left turn. Vick angrily takes a harder-than-necessary left turn. Alan hangs on tight, almost flying out of the car.Doug? Doug? Alan quickly checks the room phone.Smart move, man. Stu opens the closet door -- and freezes.Whoa.No. I think she's Alan's wife. Stu covers his mouth, oh shit! Vick produces the wallet- sized photos from Alan's wedding, compares them, and nods.Alan? Wanna step in here, buddy? A second later Alan enters, what's up?Alan, Chastity. Chastity, Alan. Alan looks down, sees Chastity SNORING on the closet floor, her body all contorted, and freezes. Oh my God.Because she's your spouse, dude! Scowling, Alan slowly crouches down. Then, a little scared, he nudges her. Nothing. He nudges her harder.Pinch her tit. It always works. Alan shakes her a bit harder and -- BRRAPPPP -- the girl lets out a massive burp and awakens, COUGHING. Alan jumps back up, terrified. The woman, CHASTITY, looks around, disoriented.Yeah, I really like her, man.So, um, did you take Alan's name?What a responsible, upstanding young Jew. They don't make `em like that anymore, am I right? Chastity smiles, sweet, as she straps on her 6 inch heels.Yeah, not so much.You don't happen to remember what time we met you last night, do you?It's the All-American love story, isn't it? What happened next?And was Doug with us then?Interesting... Do you have any idea where we went after the wedding?I know.Look, we can get your grandmother's ring back. We just gotta go about it in the right way.You are the best bridesmaids ever.Two-for-ones, man.What do you think we're doing?We're getting into the mindset of last night, to see if it sparks any memories. Now: is this exactly how you were dancing for me last night, Starr? She nods. Vick nods, pensive, scientific.Yeah, still no memories. Keep going -- and put your back into it.No. Stu, sit and enjoy your dance. Stu looks between them, torn.I'm trying to save your life here, Alan Mervish.I'm not kidding, man! Life is one long series of emergencies, and if you don't learn to stop and have a little fun along the way, you're gonna grow into a joyless old prick like your dad. I'm sorry to bring Moshe Mervish into it, but it had to be said. Now yes, we have 18 hours to find Doug -- which means we can afford to spend ten minutes celebrating the special talents of these gifted young body-artists. So sit down, have a jager shot, and smell the goddamn roses for once in your miserable life. Chastity, honey? When you're ready? Chastity pushes Alan onto the red leather banquette and starts dancing for him. He tries to squirm away:Because if he hadn't, I would've. They continue watching on in silence.Not for me. More watching in silence.Not that can do that.Because she's been touched by God. They continue staring, amazed. Just then, the door is kicked open and KIKIOLANI and KALOLO FANALUA burst into the Champagne Room, peering through the darkness, looking for our guys. Vick and Stu see them immediately.Shit. They both hop up. Alan remains sitting, however, hypnotized by Chastity. Vick grabs him.Alan, come on, man, we gotta go!Come on, man! We got company! Finally, the Guamians spot the guys and lumber for them!Chastity, honey, is there a back way out of here?! Thinking fast, Chastity grabs her clothes and darts over to a darkened, unlabeled FIRE DOOR.I'm really starting to like this girl. The guys all follow suit, sprinting down the runway and leaping over the patrons! Then the Guamians blow through the curtain, panting, very upset. They lumber down the stage -- and the patrons at the end of the runway clear the hell out of the way.Come on, Alan: tell me that wasn't just a little fun...No idea.Ditto. Officer Bladen SLAMS the table with his fist.Stu: stop talking. Alan: sit up straight. Officer Merriweather, I've told you twelve times now: we have no memory of last night. Now either charge us with a crime, or let us go. Merriweather scowls and nods at Bladen, who steps over to a TELEVISION and turns it on. Merriweather, meanwhile, pulls out a photograph of a slick ASIAN MAN in a red suit, slides it onto the table.We have no idea who this man is.Yeah, that's right. ON THE TELEVISION, grainy surveillance camera footage of a birthday party starts playing. In the video, JIMMY LANG sits in an upscale restaurant, in front of a BIRTHDAY CAKE, as a table full of hip ASIAN GUYS serenade him with \"Happy Birthday To You.\" When the guys sitting next to Jimmy lean forward to help him blow out the candles on his cake, however, we see that it's Vick, ALAN, STU, DOUG, and some BLACK GUY, all very drunk!I love you, Jimmy Lang! Merriweather FREEZES FRAME on Vick kissing the top of Jimmy Lang's shaved head. In the interrogation room, Vick, Stu and Alan sit, frozen. Silence.I know Jimmy Lang. Everyone stops, looks at Vick.Jimmy and I tried to raise capital for Girl-nasium, a 24 hour fitness center and day spa for tween-age girls, but it never got off the ground. It was an entirely legitimate enterprise -- I had no idea he was a criminal. We must've bumped into him last night, and he must've invited us to join his birthday celebration. No crime in that, is there, Officers? Merriweather gets in Vick's face, intense.Stu might. Stu shakes his head, unbelievable.Now: are you gonna charge us with something, or are we free to go? The cops look at each other, scowling. Beat.We got out, didn't we?If we'd cooperated with them, we'd be in jail right now, Alan. They reach the curb, and Stu starts trying to hail a cab. Desperation is setting in.Stu, don't. Doug is fine.Stu: Doug is fine.Stu! Enough!What did you just say?Is that right?Why do think you're so much better than us, dude?!You're out of your depth, Alan--What's so great about any of those things?!None of us ever liked you, Alan! We only hung out with you because Doug made us! Alan recoils, whoa, stung. This is clearly news to him.Why would anyone like you, dude? Have you ever thought about that? You're uptight, you're judgemental, you're cheap, and yet somehow you think you're sweeter than everyone else! Well look around, man: no one wants to be you! I'd rather be Stu than you!You punch like...your sister... Stu runs over and jumps in, trying to break them apart.That's funny, because Alan's daddy taught him tax law. Chastity smiles, a little confused. Alan is quick to retort:It's a disease, dude--!What if it's Tracy?!Because she knows you're the most easily tricked.No we don't! Tell her nothing, Stu! Stu turns back to the phone, rattled.I'm working on it! Buy us some time!What are you, retarded?! Honesty is never the best policy! Especially not with brides!Okay: tell her Alan got really drunk last night and fell down, and the doctor said not to move him for a few hours, but that we'll be back in time for the wedding.It's a fictitious canard, Alan, get over yourself! Stu: tell her!Fell over drunk.For a few hours! We'll be home before the wedding!Tracy?! Vick! How are ya, hon?Nothing! Stu is a moron. Listen, Alan hurt his back last night, so we're gonna be laid up here for a bit, but I promise we'll have Doug home in time for the wedding, okay?Yes, luckily he had a steel rod surgically implanted up his ass at birth, so the doctors anticipate a complete and swift recovery. Alan flips him the bird.What? No! No, you can't actually, Doug...Doug is out.Where is he? He's aaaat...the pharmacy. Yeah, picking up Alan's medications. Listen, Trace, I'm losing you, but we'll see you tomorrow, okay? Bye, sweetie--! Vick hangs up and nods confidently.She bought it.Maybe we should go back to the hotel and--At the top! We hit every club we went to til someone remembers what we did with Doug!Naaah, couldn't be.You think we would've remembered this...We're going to love you either way, Stu... Stu nods, focussed, nervous, like before a big game.Excuse me, friend, can you tell me where Roger is?He's cute...I guess...? Stu shrugs, yeah, I guess...? As they draw close, Roger sees them, and smiles.Listen, man, we don't really remember what happened last night, can you fill us in?Wait-- what?!You insisted?! Why'd you insist?!Not cool, Roger. Not cool.The guy from the Jimmy Lang surveillance video. The guys nod, right.We must see that video.And what time was all this?Did we lose him along the way?Hello?Atashir, many greetings to you.What?! Are you sure it's him?!Oh thank you, Atashir! You are a man of great honor! A thousand blessings upon your ancestors! Vick SLAMS his phone shut, overjoyed.Doug is in the room! A maid just found him! He's passed out, but he's okay!Atashir swears it is! The guys all laugh, a massive weight lifted.I don't even care! Hug me, you big shiny homosexual!How we doing on time?We'll be in LA by dawn. I told you bitches this would all work out... They drive off into the night, grins all around.They always have kids.Yeah, she's a total canwego.You know, she's the girl at the party who's always like \"Can we go? Can we go?\" Chastity laughs. Alan does too, shaking his head.Wait: you're going to tell her?Dude, she still hasn't forgiven me for scratching her Queensryche CD in sixth grade -- she's neeeeever gonna forgive you for marrying a stripper in Vegas.She's gonna cut your dick off, dude.Keep `er close, Paco. We'll be right back.Doug! Wake up, man!Where is Doug?They were gonna hurt me, man...I can get it! I can! I just--You have Doug?Yes! Yes. Jimmy nods and heads for the door. The Samoans follow him.Do you really think I wanted my life to turn out like this, Stu?! Do you really think I don't know that I'm a massive loser?!Jesus, you guys got out of high school and you just knew what to do, you went to college and got good jobs and found cool wives and made beautiful children -- what do I have to show for the last decade of my life?! Nothing! Vick swats a lamp off a nearby end-table -- it SMASHES against the wall! The guys freeze. Tense silence. Vick grows emotional.Jesus, I'm almost 30, and the only thing I really have...the only thing I really have is you guys.No, man, it's true! I put on a good show, but my life is so goddamn hollow and vapid and lonely, it scares me, man. I-I don't know how much longer I can keep this scam going. And now I've gone and ruined the one good thing I had... Tears threaten in his eyes. He wipes at them, angry.Just...please don't give up on me, okay? I-I don't know what I'd do without you guys. I really don't... Alan and Stu exchange a look. They've never seen brash, cocky Vick this vulnerable before. Stu can't help but give in.Love you too, bro. Love you too. They hug tight. For a while.What?!No! No. That's...that's plenty. Vick desperately tries to clear the image from his mind. Alan just frowns at his watch, stressed.12 minutes.Dude, how many Red Bulls have you had?There's only one thing left to do. They all exchange a knowing look...Shut up, Stu.We gotta go, man. Alan nods, yeah, and gets in the car...We're gonna give Jimmy a dummy bag of money, grab Doug, and make a run for it.Jimmy Lang doesn't do payment calendars, Alan! Trust me: this is our only shot of getting Doug back! Left turn! Vick skids onto Highway 12 -- a barely labelled dirt road. Things are quickly going from bad to worse...This all the cash we got? The guys frown at their empty wallets, yeah. We areAlan I need you positive please.Stuart?There's an emergency bottle of tequila in my glove box. Get it out please. Stu opens the glovebox, pulls out a bottle of Patron. He opens it, takes a swig, then passes it to Vick, who takes a pull and passes it to Alan, who also drinks. They all watch the white Yukon draw ever closer.Let's see Doug! Jimmy Lang nods to Kalolo, who opens the back door of the Yukon and pulls out a GUY with his hands tied behind his back and a plastic RALPH'S BAG over his head; he struggles a bit. The guys look a bit alarmed.Pull off the Ralph's bag! Jimmy yanks the bag off of the guy's head to revealWho the hell is that?!Yeah, you got the wrong Doug, man!Yeah, man, our Doug is white!I don't know what to tell you, bro, this isn't the Doug we requested!Christ that hurts!Who cares! Go go! Alan floors the car while Stu and Vick SPRINT and DIVE in! The caddy peels the hell out of there, kicking up rocks and dust! The Guamians FIRE after them!I can't believe you just drove my car into Jimmy Lang! Alan drives, his eyes as big as saucers.Yeah. It's probably time.I still can't believe Stu banged my sister. Vick hands the bottle to Alan, gets out, and makes for the pay phone...In the desert, on the pay phone, looking through his busted aviators into the rising sun.Tracy, it's Vick.Listen, honey...The bachelor party got a little out of control and, well...we lost Doug.Yeah, that's not gonna happen...Look, I'm really sorry, Trace. This is all my fault--What the--?! Alan gets on the phone with Tracy, his heart racing.What are you doing?So how did--?I don't believe it...It's so obvious!How'd you figure it out?!Honestly, dude, you're a genius.He's on the roof! Stu looks confused, the roof?And all day he's been throwing his crap off the roof, trying to signal someone to get him down!Okay, no, that's cool!Why'd you do it, sweet Atashir?! Why did you betray us?!Fair enough! See you next time, you beautiful Judas! They blow out of the hotel...Look, Doug, I think I speak for everyone in the car when I say I'm really sorry about locking you on the roof of the hotel.Sorry, Mapquest took us a crazy route. We ready to do this thing? The bridesmaids sit up, stunned.She looks beautiful, man.That's cool. I get it.We did it, fellahs. We pulled it off.Give him time.Hey Beck--!This just got complicated...Okay, okay, I'll go with you. Just...don't ruin the wedding. Then JIMMY LANG enters the bathroom on RED CRUTCHES.Um, what...?I will pay you back, you know.Well, Alan married a stripper, Stu went gay, and I learned a very important life lesson from an obese hoodlum.To Doug and Tracy.", "clean_line": "tracy vick parked dirt road vick near totalled cadillac deville convertible scratched dented filthy missing passenger door slouched inside guys looking like

kids?!Haylee is two, and Kaitlin is already four! Can you believe it?!Jesus, dude, those are my children--Yeah, you're good.Maybe you could wear a helmet to Doug's wedding.Me too, man! I love pudding! Alan just shakes his head, unbelievable.Dude! I can't believe I get to party all night, and then, tomorrow ...I get to sleep in! It's almost too much! And FYI, if anyone gets really drunk and craps themself, just let me know, I can have you cleaned up and partying again in under three minutes. No joke. I am a master of stool removal... They rocket off into the desert, LAUGHING...This is bigger than my house. Vick blows past them, totally unfazed.Anyone got any nipple lube--? Jesus would you look at the size of that thing?! Stu grabs the ring from Doug.Jesus, who made this thing? Diddy?Dude, it's for Becky! Alan's finally going to propose!Thish is so great! I love you guys!Dude, I'm a dad! I don't have time to get plastered anymore! It blows!Because my dad was a bad dad.Have I showed you guys pictures of my kids yet--?Oh yeah! That was hilarious! And remember when I blacked out at Homecoming and you wrote on my face with permanent marker?! That was awesome! What'd you write again?Ahh, good times, man. Good times...Yeah, we've totally grown up since then. Doug looks at them, highly dubious, then hoists his glass.Yo.What?Dude...I have a mullet. Then we hear ALAN'S VOICE in the bathroom, groggy:Whoa, did you sleep in the tub? Beat, then Stu pokes his head out of the bathroom.Check it out: Alan slept in the tub.Yeah, and it might be time for some manscaping, bro. Your bush looks like Yanni. Alan looks back up again, squinting, hungover.Dude, why is my ass killing me...?This might be the worst hangover anyone has ever had, ever.Yes: I left my hat in the room -- thank you, Alan. They continue eating. Alan looks up again, still troubled.Yeah. He's not here.Good morning, this is Stu?It's Vick-- Then Stu realizes. Oh.This is Doug's phone. Vick nods, ya. He's already dialing another number.Yeah, and we told Tracy we'd have Doug back to LA by five. Vick just looks at both of them, his mouth full of food:No, no. It's cool, I'm a dad. It's totally cool...Hey guys. DOUG! DOUG--! Then Stu registers what just happened. He stops and turns around -- enh? -- but the gay men are gone. Before he can comment, however, he sees Vick and Alan talking to Atashir atYou find Doug?Maybe he went for a jog?Or shopping? The guys just look at him like: you're an idiot.Okay, honestly? I don't even remember going to dinner.Was Doug still with us? Vick rubs his temples, trying to fight through the hangover.Hey! Look, we were at the Flamingo. A long beat of silence... Then the guys hurry to an empty BLACKJACK TABLE and start emptying their pockets of the detritus from the night before. They find matchbooks, receipts, room keys, a valet ticket...We drove last night? The guys wince, jesus...Yeah, totally! There's no way we went there! We're not gay! Hahaha! They frown, then stare at all the clues lined up on the blackjack table.Yeah, I'm with Alan on this one.Guys, wait. I need your help -- oh my God -- like right now. Come on.You don't have to look up my butt, just at it. Something is terribly, terribly wrong... Stu's jeans fall to the ground -- and everyone freezes.I-I-I don't know?! What do you think it means?!Really?! What?! Alan tries to think of one.Oh my God, guys: what if I'm gay?!I do watch Dancing With The Stars with the kids!And once, I caught myself gazing at a topless photo of David Beckham!And then I had those weird feelings for Vick that time in middle school, remember?! Everyone stops. Vick most of all.Yeah, that weekend we were all camping -- I told you this.I didn't?Yeah. I had weird feelings for you that weekend. Like really hot, really gay feelings. But then they went away. Vick is just looking at him, stunned.Wait, what? Just then, a FATHER and his YOUNG SON enter the men's room and see Stu standing there, pants down, in his G string...Wait -- so have either of you tested the waters?How am I going to tell my wife?Jesus, what kind of father am I? Alan's hand CLINKS against the railing again, and this time it registers. Alan looks down -- and stops cold.You think Erin will try to take the kids--?Cool ring. Also, my Dad is gonna have a field day with this. Vick, however, recognizes the implications of the ring, and starts back towards Alan.What's the big--? Oh! OH! OH!Maybe it's not a wedding ring?This is worse than my underwear! Vick takes the ring and reads the rest of the inscription:Check it out, some idiot threw his bed out the window last night. Stu points over at a huge stone GRIFFIN in front of the hotel with an ENTIRE BED impaled upon its ear.Really?You okay, Vick?Naaah.Jesus, she is stacked.Sorry. She looks really nice. But Alan is too busy gaping at the next photo, of him and Chastity atop a UNICORN in the chapel.No way! Awesome!I want a shield!Hey, how's Becky doing, man?!Look on the bright side, Alan. Vick found a great clue.That's another hour of last night that we can account for. Isn't that great?Great -- where was the feast?I ain't mad atcha, dude...Guys, come on, let's not use our angry words--Who are these guys?!Maybe they just wanted to talk!Oh my god I am such a bad dad!Yeah, Vick, what's going on?If anything ever happened to my family, Vick...Come on, let's toss the place. Alan starts wading through the crap in the living room, while Vick and Stu head off to check the bedrooms...Hey, check it out, Vick! I invested 30 grand in your custard store last night! Vick calls from the other bedroom.Hey, you wanna come in here a sec?! Vick enters a moment later to find Stu staring into the closet. Vick follows his gaze and sees a SEXY WOMAN snoring away on the closet floor, her blonde hair obscuring her face.You think she's what those Guamian dudes wanted?Wake her up, man!She seems really cool.Yeah, are you Chastity Mervish now--?They don't open.Dude, I think your wife's mad at you.Work friends?Dude.Don't be so hard on yourself, dude-- Just then Chastity runs back over with two BLONDE STRIPPERS.Dude: I might not be gay. Then Alan hurries in with Chastity; he looks pissed.I think I know why he married her.Is it weird that we're sitting this close watching?I really shouldn't be here. I have daughters. Then both of their heads angle the same way.How can she do that without dislocating her hip?Did she just do that in heels?!Did you see them trample those tiny Japanese businessmen?! I think they killed like four of them! Everyone laughs. Vick puts his arm around Alan.Honestly, man, I will confess to anything you want!Who is he?Did we kill someone last night--?!We're in a lot of trouble, aren't we.Oh no, sir, please don't!It was really nice meeting you--!Why hasn't he called? It's 8:30. The guys shake their heads, I don't know.Do you think he's okay--?I mean, we were hanging out with mobsters last night, man! They kill people for looking at `em weird--!Or what if we like drove Doug out to the desert and left him, just as like a funny prank--?!Okay, let's all take a breath--Look, we're all tired and hungry--Wait, what--? Too late: Alan charges Vick and TACKLES him onto the lawn! They roll on the ground, trying to punch each other, but it ends up being a mess of half-chops, pulled hair, and hands in each other's faces...Hey, no! Time out! We all need a time out--! THUNK! Stu is accidentally kicked in the face and goes down. Alan and Vick continue rolling on the lawn, trying to beat the crap out of each other. They could be kids again. Then, just when it starts getting way too intense,Good call on happy hour, Chastity. These tacos kick ass.Guys, come on! For Doug?\"Number blocked.\"Good evening, this is Stu!It's Tracy! Vick glares at Alan. Alan looks away, shit.Why is she calling me?!Hey, Trace! W-What's going on?Wow, that sounds amazing!Ummmm........Hang on. She wants to know where Doug is!Um, what'd you say?Yeah, um, hang on. She still wants to know!Listen, Tracy, Alan fell on aH-He was drunk. And the doctor -- a different doctor, not the one he fell on -- he said we couldn't move him until the wedding--But we're going to have the wedding at your home-- Tracy just looks really confused. Exasperated, Vick rips the phone away from Stu.Oh my God, guys! Look! Stu holds his hand under the UV light -- it's covered in STAMPS from all the clubs they've been to the night before! Stu yanks up his sleeve to reveal his ENTIRE FOREARM GLOWS, completely covered with stamps! The guys hurry back and slide their forearms under the UV light, too: they all have the same stamps! Their eyes alight:Where do you want to start?!Hey: is that guy wearing Doug's hat?! The guys look over to see that the DRIVER of the next car over is, in fact, wearing the DISTINCTIVE FEDORA-STYLE HAT Doug was wearing last night. The guy turns off the Strip.All right, this is the last place we went, \"Chaps.\" Vick rolls to a stop in front of...You sure we came here...? Then they look up at the marquee. It reads \"CHAPS: HOME OFMaybe I'll just wait in the car-- But Vick is already shoving Stu out of the car.Yeah, I don't think we came here...Those could be anybody's. Thousands of people go to Colorado State--I am so gay... Just then, a BUFF WAITER in assless chaps blows by, smiling.R-Roger?Oh. G-Good, thanks...?Is that true?Oh my god.Did we...you know...do anything?Was I...the boy or the girl?I'm really not sure we can be friends anymore... Finally, Chastity starts LAUGHING.No! That's cool, I don't need to see it--I'm a Dad, I-I don't get to the gym as much as I'd like...Annnnd that would explain the searing ass pain.That doesn't make any sense.He was passed out, how far could he have gone--? Just then, Vick's cellphone rings. The caller ID reads \"MANDALAY BAY.\" He answers:They're sure it's him?!Oh thank God he's okay...I know, if I actually was gay, I'd totally date Roger first. What a gentle soul. They get into Vick's clunker.We like you way better.Becky collects teapots.She has low fun sugar.Uh-oh. The door SLAMS behind them, and they whip around to see KIKIOLANI standing in front of the door, blocking their exit. He has an identical CAST on his right arm.Not good. Just then, a toilet FLUSHES and an immensely large man in a red suit exits the bathroom, drying his hands. We recognize him from his police photo as crime boss JIMMY LANG, 50's.How could you do this to us, man? We're your best friends... Vick looks away, ashamed.Oh my God...Was it for the custard store?Is that true, Vick? Vick just stares out at the city, not denying it.Were any of your deals...real?Dude, I manage an Applebee's, that money meant something to me... Vick spins around, furious:Come on, Vick--Come on, man, we've been bro's since third grade, it's gonna take a lot more than money to ruin our friendship. Vick looks down, deeply touched...What I don't understand is why you didn't just ask me for the money. I would've given you every last cent I had, man...I love you, man.Also, I banged your sister sophomore year. Vick pulls away.Sorry. Just seemed like a good time to tell you. Vick stammers at Stu, speechless.She had just broken up with that guy from Central, we were playing \"I Never\" at Tim Donahee's pool, one thing lead to another--I think I can get a 20 grand cash advance on my credit card...Time check!Chip check!Faster! Come on chip check!I stopped counting at six! I can hear my heart beating in my head! Alan finishes counting the chips -- and frowns.You sure we don't want red?! What if the ball lands on red--!I can't watch! My heart's gonna explode! Can your heart even explode?! Because I think my heart is gonna explode! I can't watch! The ball lands. Dead silence.It's red, isn't it?! I knew it! Tell me it's not red!So what's our plan?Here they come. They all look up to see a WHITE YUKON approaching on the far horizon, kicking up a trail of dust. The guys tense up.Yeah?I can't believe you just saved my life!He's gonna be really upset!That was you!Vick, who won?!Yeah, we threw it out the window.I don't get it.I-I still don't get it--Not...to me...so much?You think he's still up there?!Oh my god, I'm so glad you're okay!Yeah, you have every right to be upset! We validate your anger!Well, we can't drive! It's 350 miles to LA and the wedding starts at 10, which is in----three hours! Beat. Then Vick, Stu and Alan exchange a look...a smile slowly creeps across their faces.You gotta admit, it's a pretty funny prank... I mean, up until the part when we forgot all about you. Doug just stares out at the desert in stony silence.He's still not talking to us.You think Doug's ever going to talk to us again?Uh-oh. The guys all look over to seeOh, I missed you guys so much!We'll tell you the whole story when you get back from your honeymoon.To Doug and Tracy.", "clean_line": "dude best weekend oh pictures kids

tell story honeymoon doug tracy"}, "DOUG": {"raw_line": "No, dude, show `em. Stu fishes pictures out of his wallet and eagerly shows them to Doug in the front seat. Doug is clearly the core of this group, the glue that holds these childhood friends together.How cute... Good for you, man. Doug shows the photos to Vick; he nods, impressed.Hey so Alan, are you and Becky still together? But before Alan can answer--She still pressuring you to get married?What is it?Yeah, man, count me in.Yeah. I thought I'd be nervous, but I'm actually just really psyched. Alan nods, impressed.Oh yeah.Enh, I think he wanted more for his girl. I mean, I'm a teacher who makes 45 grand a year, and he's a titan of industry who makes 45 grand a day, you know? I sort of get it... Also, I'm banging his daughter. I'm not sure you ever get past that.You got floss? Alan gestures towards his toiletries kit. Doug picks it up, starts looking for the floss. Then Alan remembers something -- but it's too late. Doug has found the RING BOX inside Alan's kit, and opened it to reveal a HUGE DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.Holy Christ! Alan quickly reaches for the ring--It's Alan's. For Becky.Well: now we have two things to celebrate!Yeah, what happened, Stuey?! You used to be able to drink us all under the table!What? No!That's true, Stuey, but you're different. We've talked about this. Stu just stares at the guys, glassy-eyed. Beat.Little toast: to Tracy, the coolest, kindest, most beautiful woman I've ever met. I can't believe she let me come this weekend -- much less agreed to spend the rest of her life with me. I think both will prove to be massive errors of judgement on her part. The guys chuckle, hear-hear.And to being here, with my best friends in the world. There's nowhere else I'd rather be. The guys raise their glasses, touched.That said, let's not get too stupid tonight, okay? I'm getting married in 36 hours.I'm serious, dudes! Nothing above the neck -- no piercings, no weird haircuts, no facial tattoos. I gotta look decent on Sunday.Vick: you shaved Alan's eyebrows off the night before graduation!Well then...to a night we'll never forget. They CLINK glasses, shoot their shots, andDon't...even...talk to me. The guys stop short.It's a long story. All I can say is I'm so sorry. And I promise, for as long as we're married, I will never ever put you through something like this again. Can... Can you forgive me? Tracy studies his face, searching... All the guests wait with bated breath... The groomsmen wince, come on come on come on... Then, unable to be mad at Doug, Tracy smiles and kisses him. He kisses her back. The guests all SIGH in relief. The groomsmen exhale, whew. Vick and Alan covertly knock fists. The Minister clears his throat.To me and Tracy -- and to being here, with my three former best friends in the world... The guys LAUGH.There's nowhere else I'd rather be right now. They nod, heartfelt, hear-hear.That said, let's not get too stupid tonight, okay? I'm going on my honeymoon in 24 hours... The guys all nod reassuringly.", "clean_line": "dude em stu fishes pictures wallet eagerly shows doug seat doug clearly core group glue holds childhood friends cute good man doug shows photos vick nods impressed hey alan becky alan answer pressuring married yeah man count yeah thought nervous actually psyched alan nods impressed oh yeah enh think wanted girl mean teacher makes grand year titan industry makes grand day know sort banging daughter sure past got floss alan gestures toiletries kit doug picks starts looking floss alan remembers late doug ring box inside alan kit opened reveal huge diamond engagement ring holy christ alan quickly reaches ring alan becky things celebrate yeah happened stuey able drink table true stuey different ve talked stu stares guys glassy eyed beat little toast tracy coolest kindest beautiful woman ve met believe let come weekend agreed spend rest life think prove massive errors judgement guys chuckle hear hear best friends world guys raise glasses touched said let stupid tonight okay getting married hours dudes neck piercings weird haircuts facial tattoos gotta look decent sunday vick shaved alan eyebrows night graduation night ll forget clink glasses shoot shots anddon talk guys stop short long story sorry promise long married like forgive tracy studies face searching guests wait bated breath groomsmen wince come come come unable mad doug tracy smiles kisses kisses guests sigh relief groomsmen exhale whew vick alan covertly knock fists minister clears throat tracy best friends world guys laugh right nod heartfelt hear hear said let stupid tonight okay going honeymoon hours guys nod reassuringly"}, "ALAN": {"raw_line": "Hey, am I rubbed in? Stu glances over and sees un-rubbed-in sunscreen all over Alan's face.Enh, we've moved past the pressure stage...it's more like aggravated assault stage now? Like at the last wedding we went to, she threw a camera at my head, called me a closet fag, then ran out crying. The guys wince, oooo.But we talked, and everything's cool now.Great idea, Stu. Thanks.Isn't custard like a trillion calories--?Is this gonna do better than the hip-hop label you started, Vick? Or the topless sushi bar? Or the mobile tattoo parlor--?What?I am so not getting paid back.So, you ready for Sunday?Tracy's dad still hate you?Any closer to figuring out why?Ahhh yeah, I wasn't going to tell anyone about that-- Just then, Stu wanders in, wearing only his COLORADO STATE BOXER SHORTS. His gut is sizable.Actually, I-I was trying to keep it a secret, so-- Just then Vick blows in, singing, effeminate:Oh, it's a family heirloom. My grandmother smuggled it through the Holocaust, actually. I was going to propose to Beck this weekend. Doug throws his arm around Alan, happy for him.We've only had two shots, man!Seriously, man, we're your friends.Just give me ten more minutes, Beck...Wet. Water. Jesus, what's--?! There's a THUD as Alan falls out of tub. Beat. Then Stu and a very confused, very hungover, very wet Alan stumble out of the bathroom. Alan appears to be wearing his polo shirt from the night before. Only, as we PULL BACK, we see that his shirt is cut off at his chest -- he's naked from there down.What did we do last night?I can't taste anything.Hey... Are we missing something? The guys all slowly look around. Then Stu points at Alan:No. That's not it... There's something else... Vick nods at Stu as he stuffs food in his mouth.Doug. Guys, where's Doug? The guys look around. Hunh.You calling the room? Vick nods, uh-huh. He lets it ring, rubbing his temples. Then he hangs up.Ummm...shouldn't we look for him? Check-out is in like ten minutes.What an asshole. Stu, check the pool and the casino, I'll check the room and the gym. Maybe he's working out or something... Stu nods, and they slowly slide out of the booth.And Vick, if you could keep a close eye on the buffet, that'd be really helpful. Thanks, man. Alan and Stu saunter off. Vick yells after them, mouth full:Doug...? Doug...? Wake up, man. Alan enters the bedroom where Doug slept, and stops. It takes him a second to realize what's wrong:That's weird...I hate you all...No, I assume you didn't either? Stu shakes his head, no. Then Atashir hangs up his phone.Dude. It's 120 degrees outside.Great. So we've officially lost Doug. His wedding is in what, 22 hours?Okay, so last night... The guys wince, trying to remember. It's painful to think.Right, that was like, 6ish...?Yeah. Then...we played craps at the Hard Rock...maybe?I'm pretty much blank after The Hard Rock.So that was what, 10ish?Okay. So we only have a 13 hour window where we could've lost him. They guys frown. Shit. Stu puts his hands into his pockets, thinking... Then he feels something. A matchbook. He pulls it out. It's from The Flamingo Nightclub.ATM receipt from the Rio at 10:37-- For 600 dollars?!Here's a receipt from Sbarro. The meal was comped for some reason--Someone could've given that to us.I think we should call Tracy.What if Doug called her? She might know where he is. Stu shifts uncomfortably, tenderly adjusting his ass.But shouldn't we at least tell her we're gonna be getting home late?I think I'm beginning to see why you're always single.Jesus, what is it?Sweet mother of mercy...I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation for this...Yeah, maybe there isn't.Oh god, that doesn't mean you're gay.So what, he's a great-looking dude--Yeah, I think we'd all remember.Wait -- I was there that weekend. Did you have gay feelings for me?What?! I was a good-looking kid!All right, we're scaring the children. Let's go. The guys head for the door. Stu quickly pulls up his pants.Oh my God.Oh...my...God.\"To My Noble Husband, Alan.\" The guys eyes bulge, oh shit!That was us, dude.Yeah, there's no bed in Doug's room.Yeah, Stu, I really do.Seriously: what am I gonna tell Becky? For 14 years she's been begging me to get married...Wait, is that homeless guy wearing Doug's shirt? The guys turn to see a HOMELESS GUY weaving down the sidewalk in Doug's DISTINCTIVE ORANGE SHIRT from the night before. Once they pass, the guys exchange a look.What if they don't remember us--?W-Who's...Chastity?I am never...ever...drinking again.We got a unicorn?!A-And how much did that cost?I'm gonna kill you!I don't suppose you have any sort of return policy, do you?What. We hear someone YELLING AT HIM. Alan's eyes bulge.Oh, hey Becky! Hi! He steps away to take the call. Vick explains to Carla:No! I-I have no idea--! Then Vick calls over from the white plastic table, pissed:Nothing! Baby, nothing, the GUYSI know, baby! I know--Yes. I will. I promise.Yes, no, I love you too! Becky hangs up, rolling her eyes, unbelievable. STAY WITH ALAN as he closes his cellphone. Exhales.Amazing.I paid 7 grand for Sbarro?!Let go of what, exactly, Vick?! The fact that I married a complete stranger last night? Or that my girlfriend's about to leave me? Or that I'm broke? Which one?!I know you think it's like terminally uncool to be in a committed relationship, Vick, but I actually love Becky, okay?Yeah, no, you're absolutely right, Vick, I've always secretly wanted to marry a bottle blonde with big fake melon tits named Chastity!I was going to propose to her this weekend, you jackass!I swear to God, Vick, if you say one more word to me, I will destroy you.Vick, don't be a dick--!Why'd you do that?!Do you think we stole something from them last night?!I'm calling the police. This is getting way out of control--\"No cops?!\" Who are you, Fitty Cent?!Every little thing?! We were just assaulted by the Yakuza!They knew your name, Vick! Which means they probably know who Stu and I are, too!No messages.What...what am I supposed to do?Why me?!Listen to me. Just...did we, or did we not, have sex last night? Alan braces, please say no, please say no... Vick braces, please say yes, please say yes...Wait-- we didn't use a condom?!Can someone...please open a window?You work here? Behind him, Vick SLAPS FIVE with Stu, psyched.Look, I don't know how to tell you this, but--The Holocaust, man. Alan just stares into space. Vick takes him by the shoulder.I have besmirched my people.Please...don't. Just then a SPOTLIGHT finds Chastity and Alan, and the SLEAZY PONYTAILED DJ up in the booth comes over the P.A. system:Twenties?Look, I don't know how to say this, but my friends and I were very drunk last night. We would never come to a place like this-- He glances over at Vick and Stu -- but they're gone.Guys?What the hell are you doing?!We don't have time for this! We gotta find Doug!What?You are so goddamn selfish, Vick. You really are. Stu, let's go.Dude: Doug is missing! We have less than 18 hours til his wedding! We do not have time for this!Vick--!No, look-- I am like totally against this, morally and politically. Plus Becky specifically asked me not to--Whoa, whoa, I'm smelling the roses-- Vick literally yanks Alan up from the banquette.That was...a little fun. Vick smiles -- just as a LAS VEGAS POLICE CAR hops the curb, lights flashing, and cuts them off! Two mustachioed COPS get out and hurry for them, pointing, intense.Whatever we did, we're so sorry!Nothing?Oh my god--Officers, I swear, we have no memory of that ever occurring--We have a very important wedding--!You do?!Oh, thank you, Officers!Did you have to be such a dick?!Yeah, four hours later! If we'd just cooperated with them--What are we gonna do now? We've got zero leads on where Doug is!I said I knew I shouldn't have come this weekend, Vick!Yeah, that's right. I only came because Doug insisted. Vick steps towards Alan, heated.I don't -- I just think I'm better than you, Vick! And trust me, it's not that hard! You haven't changed one bit since high school! Jesus, you're 28 years old and you still talk back to cops?! Really?!And you're still the one getting us in trouble! Only then it was hiding your weed in our locker, and now you've got us partying with wanted felons! It's not cute anymore, man! We're too old for this! Vick scowls; this is actually hitting home...And all your stupid get-rich-quick schemes?! Girl-nasium?! Custard?! In Los Angeles?! Are you joking?!When's the last time you had a real job, man?! When's the last time you had a girlfriend?! Hell, when's the last time you picked up the check?!Those \"things,\" Vick, are what grown men do! Vick swallows, furious.Stu...? Is that true? Stu gestures, uncomfortable, enh, who's to say? Alan nods, I see, his face reddening.I've...always...hated you...Hey -- how'd you start Vick's car?And Vick's daddy taught him how to get really drunk at his kid's soccer games and then piss himself.What if it's Doug?We have tell her we lost Doug.No, just tell her the truth! Honesty is always the best policy!Why do I have to be the one that fell over drunk?!Perfect. We just told Tracy we'd have Doug home in 13 hours, and we still have no idea where he is... They pass a DOORMAN on their way out, who's standing with a stamp and a UV light reader.It's like a map of last night! The guys look at each other, hope returning to their faces!Nice clue, Stuey! I can't believe we're actually gonna pull this off! Stu grins over at the car next to them. Then he stops.Lots of people have hats like that. Stu nods, yeah, I guess...The Golden Pony. That's us.Then why is your underwear nailed to the wall? The guys turn to see numerous pairs of MEN'S UNDERWEAR nailed to the wall nearby. A sign above it reads \"CHAPS WALL OF FAME.\" We recognize Stu's COLORADO STATE BOXERS.Oh my God, are they autographed?Stay very close to me. She smiles and dances through the crowd.Some of my best friends are gay.Not...not really? I live in Connecticut, man, we don't even have black people yet. Stu nods, right. Then, after steeling himself, he enters...I don't know! I don't know why I insisted!So what did happen last night?Really? Doug did?And our Doug was with us?Wait, so we left with Doug at 4:45, we got back to the hotel at 5:00, and Doug was gone by 5:30 when Chastity met back up with us?After all this?! He's in the room?! They keep laughing and hug each other, heartfelt. Vick even hugs Roger.That was cool of Roger to give you all the tapes of your performance.This has officially been the craziest weekend of my life. Thanks for all your help. You were awesome.I'm sorry about all this, Chastity.Beg pardon?Okay, well, I'm sorry, Jennifer.Where you from?Oh yeah?You fly out every week?Kid?No kids. Same girlfriend for 14 years. Becky. Alan shows her a photo of Becky on his cellphone.Becky is great.She has low blood sugar.Jesus, guys! This is the girl I'm going to marry! If, you know...she forgives me for cheating on her...Of course I'm going to tell her! I could never keep something like that from her.Well, then that's just the price I'm going to have to pay. Alan looks off, stoic. Chastity pats his hand, proud.Listen, Mr. Lang, whatever we did last night, we are incredibly sorry-What's going on, Vick? Vick stammers, trying to find the words...Jesus, Vick...M-M-Mr. Lang?H-How much does Vick owe?200 thousand dollars?!How the hell could you blow that kind of money?!Jesus, Stu, wake up! There is no custard store! Vick was just trying to rip us off to pay back Jimmy Lang!Look, I'm glad we're all sharing, but we've got three hours to come up with 200 grand, or else... The guys nod, frowning, back on point.I'd offer to take a loan out, but it's 3 o'clock in the morning, I'm pretty sure my bank is closed.So that just leaves 180 grand... The guys frown at each other.Just over 100 grand. The guys wince, damn.It's not red... Stu turns, ecstatic--It's green. The ball has stopped on green, DOUBLE ZERO. Stu clutches his chest, like he's having a seizure. Vick inhales, grim. Alan slowly drops to his knees. Chastity closes her eyes. Their HUGE PILE OF CHIPS is raked off the table...No...It might get a little dangerous. I wouldn't want... He trails off. Chastity nods.Thanks for all your help. Awkward silence. The cold desert wind blows.Yeah, probably not... Alan looks genuinely sad.Yep, just driving out to the middle of desert to meet some mobsters, what could possibly go wrong...? The guys all frown.I think we should tell Mr. Lang that we couldn't get the money, but that, if he's amenable, we could create a payment calendar--Yes, good! What an airtight plan--!This is the dumbest plan ever.I can't believe this is how we're going to die... The Yukon pulls up about ten yards away. No one moves. The Yukon's doors open... The Cadillac's doors open... TIGHT ON the Jimmy Lang's RED BOOT as it hits the road...Jesus, what'd they do to him?Oh my God: it's the other Doug! Roger's friend, the cake designer!Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God...I'm being shot at! I'm being shot at!Oh my god, is he okay?!Yeah, I was just thinking that!Now can we call Tracy?Who wants to make the call? Beat. Then Vick reaches for his nose, odd man out. Stu and Alan immediately reach for their noses, too. It's close.What?! No! I beat you by a mile!Well, I'll be damned... Vick grabs the bottle of Patron, takes a long swig. Beat.Tracy, it's Alan! Hey, Vick is just joking around! We've got Doug right here! Vick looks like: what?!I know, Vick is such a prick! We'll see you at the wedding! Bye! Alan hangs up and races back to the car. Vick follows.I know where Doug is!Remember when we saw Doug's bed impaled on the griffin thing?!No: the windows don't open, remember?!And that's why we've been seeing Doug's clothes all over Vegas! He was trying to signal someone!And it totally jives with the timeline, right?! We brought Doug back to the hotel at 5:00, he was passed out...The Patron, man! It reminded me of our first drink of the night!After Doug passed out, we must've taken him up there in his bed as a prank, so he'd wake up on the roof or whatever? Then we forgot him.Only one way to find out...No flights to LA with empty seats!Totally understandable, man. Whenever you're ready...I never had a doubt. They LAUGH. Alan smiles, more relaxed than we've ever seen him. They sip champagne and watch Doug and Tracy enjoy their first dance on the dance floor.Yeah. Like a decade or two-- Then Stu sees someone approaching over Alan's shoulder.I-I'm so sorry, I can explain-- Then there's a WOMAN'S VOICE behind them.Jennifer? Chastity smiles that he called her by her real name.She's my wife. Becky's jaw drops. Chastity smiles slightly. Stu and Vick grin, oh shit!We don't make each other happy anymore, Beck. And we can keep not making each other happy for another 14 years -- hell, maybe even another 50 years -- but let's not. Let's find people who make our hearts race. Let's be excited and fun and alive again... Alan looks at Becky, sincere, honest. Beat.I'm sorry, Beck. I really am. Can I buy you a free drink? Chastity smiles, takes his arm, and they walk off together towards the bar.Let's start with dinner, and see where it goes...?Damn straight you will! They all LAUGH.We really are sorry, man. Doug nods, I know.

Then she notices the guys staring down at her. She smiles, recognizing them:Oh hey, guys! What's up? She shakily climbs to her feet to expose a skimpy skirt, a snug tube top, and mascara smeared all over her face. The guys have no idea what to say. She kisses Alan on the cheek, very intimate -- like, well, a husband and wife.Morning, honey... She exits into the living room, picking her wedgie. Beat. Alan is speechless.Well...ya? Alan slumps, his life over. Vick pumps his fist, YES!But we waited til we were married. Alan GROANS.I know -- he even wanted to use a rubber. Alan breaks into a COUGHING FIT.It's cool, I sponge. Alan leans against a wall, dizzy.So you guys don't remember any of last night?Hey, been there before, right? Sucks, though. The wedding was really fun. I'm bummed you don't remember it, Alan. She smiles, a little saddened. Stu whispers to Alan:Sure, we met at the bar at like 10:00? Then we got married on my smoke break, which was like 11:00?Well, I had to go back to work. But when I got off at 5:30, I met up with you guys back here.No.No, but I bet some of my work friends do. You were partying with them pretty hard.Yeah -- and this is the pole where we first met! She stops at a pole, around which a BRUNETTE STRIPPER currently spins. Alan looks ill.It's always been my lucky pole...Come on, let's go meet my bridesmaids!These were my bridesmaids, Anastasia and Starr!Oh my God, he's playing our song! This song was playing when we met, remember?! You kept sliding twenties into my thong and saying \"I will always love you. I will always love you.\" Alan closes his eyes.Yeah, it was so sweet...Come on! The guys race after her...Come on! Chastity, in six inch leucite heels, sprints down the main runway, leaps over the patrons sitting at the end, and hits the floor running!That might not be like, the smartest place to fight? Vick and Alan look over at the huge LAS VEGAS POLICE DEPARTMENT sign right next to them. They frown...Yeah, I always come here when I get out of jail. The guys exchange a quick look.Oh, my daddy taught me how to hotwire almost anything.Guys: he's kidding. Roger breaks into a smile and slaps five with Chastity. The guys all exhale, incredibly relieved.Anything for my hubby. Alan's smile flickers slightly.I'm kidding, Alan. I know last night wasn't, you know, real... She looks out at Vegas as it flies by.Jennifer.My name is Jennifer. Jennifer Elly. Alan hesitates; suddenly she seems a lot more...human.Oh, don't be. Last night wasn't the first flaky decision I've ever made in my life. I mean, I am a stripper. Alan tries not to laugh. She smiles, a twinge sadly.LA. Tarzana.Yeah. I work here on the weekends.Yeah. I'd move, but my kid is in a great school.I have a little girl, Sarah. She's... Well, she's everything. Chastity proudly shows Alan a photo from her purse of a cute little toddler. Alan smiles.What about you?Wow, she's stunning. Stu turns around, unable to keep quiet any longer:A what?Good for you. She smiles at Alan, impressed, pulling her hair from her face. Alan looks at her anew... It's a sweet moment...Well, it is Vegas... The guys' eyebrows all rise, you think...?Would you like me to come with?I'm so sorry...about everything.There's no sense...in exchanging numbers or anything...right?Well...I'll always remember you as a great first husband, then. They both smile weakly.You can just send the divorce papers to the Crazy Horse or whatever... Alan nods, okay. Another awkward pause.Thanks for reminding me that there are still some really good guys out there, Alan. I don't...I don't get to meet too many of them. She smiles a bit sadly, kisses him on the cheek, and walks off. TIGHT ON Alan's Grandmother's ring still on her finger. Alan doesn't remember the ring, however; he's too busy watching her walk out of his life, and feeling a real sense of loss... Then Vick fires up the car next to him.standing behind them in a very sexy, very elegant dress, her hair back. She cleans up nicely. Alan swallows, whoa.I-I know I wasn't invited, but I just had to return this... She hands Alan his GRANDMOTHER'S HOLOCAUST RING.
