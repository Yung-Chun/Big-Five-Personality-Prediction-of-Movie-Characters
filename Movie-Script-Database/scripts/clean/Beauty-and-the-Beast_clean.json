Have you lost something again?To return this book to Pere Robert. It's about two lovers in fair Verona.There must be more than this provincial lifeTwo cities in Northern Italy. I didn't want to come back.Have you got any new places to go?Thank you, Pere Robert. Your library almost makes our small corner of the world feel big.Oh... isn't this amazing? It's my favorite part because you'll see Here's where she meets Prince Charming But she won't discover that it's him `Til chapter threeYou've read it?Sorry, not tonight.No.Papa, do you think I'm odd?I don't know. People talk.Just tell me one more thing about her.A rose like the one in the painting.And every year, you bring it.I'll see you tomorrow!Stay safe...The laundry.Come!...over the dark wood.All I wanted was to teach a child to read.I'm not ready to have children.It's a small village, Gaston. I've met them all.Gaston, we could never make each other happy. No one can change that much.I might be a farm girl, but I'm not simple. I'm sorry, but I will never marry you, Gaston.Can you imagine? Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless...Madame Gaston, can't you just see it Madame Gaston, his little wife No sir, not me, I guarantee itI want much more than this Provincial life...I want adventure in the great wide somewhere I want it more than I can tell And for once it might be grand To have someone understand I want so much more than They've got plannedPhilippe?What happened? Where is Papa?!Take me to him!Who said that? Who's there?Papa!? Is that you?Oh, your hands are ice. We need to get you home.Who?!Who's there? Who are you?I've come for my father.Liar!I asked for the rose. Punish me, not him!A life sentence for a rose?Come into the light.Alright, Papa. I will leave. I need a minute alone with him.Are you so cold-hearted that you won't allow a daughter to kiss her father goodbye? Forever can spare a minute!I should have been with you.Forget you? Everything I am is because of you.I love you too, Papa...I'm not afraid. And I will escape, I promise.He is my father.Don't hurt him!My room? But I thought --AHHH!What are you?And you can talk.Why would I be startled? I'm talking to a candle.Why, what's in the west wing?It's... beautiful.Is everything here alive? Hello, what's your name?But I'm not a princess.Just a minute.You've taken me prisoner and now you want to have dinner with me? Are you insane?And I told you no!I'd starve before I ever ate with you!I told you to go away.I'm so worried about him. He's never been on his own.But he said, \"If she doesn't eat with me, she doesn't eat at all.\"Surely you're as trapped here as I am. Don't you ever want to escape?Lumiere mentioned something about the West Wing...Good night.Nothing.Getting out of here!You have to help me... you have to stand...If you held still, it wouldn't hurt as much.Well if you hadn't frightened me, I wouldn't have run away.Well you should learn to control your temper.Try to get some rest.Why do you care so much about him?But he has cursed you somehow. Why? You did nothing.How in the midst of all this sorrow Can so much hope and love endure? I was innocent and certain Now I'm wiser but unsureWhat happens when the last petal falls?I want to help you. There must be some way to lift the curse.Love can transpose to form and dignity. Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind. And therefore --So you know Shakespeare?Actually, \"Romeo and Juliet\" is my favorite play.Sorry?Like what?It's wonderful.Have you really read every one of these books?Was that a joke? Are you making jokes now?The air is blue and keen and cold And in a frozen sheath enrolledEach branch, each twig, each blade of grass Seems clad miraculously with glassBut in that solemn silence Is heard the whisper Of every sleeping thing: \"Look, look at me Come wake me up For still here I be.\"There's something sweet and almost kind But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefinedAnd now he's dear and so unsure I wonder why I didn't see it there beforeNew and a bit alarming Who'd have ever thought that this could be?True that he's no Prince Charming But there's something in him that I simply didn't see!What are you reading?Guinevere and Lancelot.But still... it's a romance.I never thanked you for saving my life.They know how to have a good time.Me, too. The villagers say that I'm a \"funny girl,\" but I don't think they mean it as a compliment.Almost as lonely as your castle.How amazing.Paris.It's so much smaller than I imagined.This is the Paris of my childhood These were the borders of my life In this crumbling dusty attic Where an artist loved his wife I thought that I would find an answer Here where his heart has always livedNow I see it's empty and abandoned Easy to remember Harder to move on Knowing that the Paris of my childhood Is goneThat's the only story Papa could never bring himself to tell. And I knew better than to ask...Let's go home.I don't know...Could anyone be happy if they're not free?My father taught me to dance. I used to step on his toes a lot.Very much.I'd like to see my father.Papa! What are they doing to him?!What did you say?Thank you.STOP!Open this door! He's hurt!My father's not crazy! Gaston... Tell him!I have just come from the castle and there is a beast!You want proof? SHOW ME THE BEAST!There is your proof!No, don't be afraid. He is gentle and kind.He's not a monster, Gaston. You are. The beast would never hurt anyone.This isn't over Gaston, you'll see!I have to warn the beast --He let me go, papa. He sent me back to you.He took me there. I know what happened to maman.I understand.Will you help me now?Yes. Yes it is.Where is he?!NEVER.NO!I tried to stop them!Stop! Gaston, no!No! It's too far!Of course I came back. I'll never leave you again.We're together now. It's going to be fine. You'll see.No... please, no...Please, don't leave me.

My future wife. Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village. That makes her the best.I know. Belle can be as argumentative as she is beautiful.Yes, but ever since the war I've been missing something. And she's the only girl I've met who gives me that sense of...I don't know what that means.Right from the moment when I met her, saw her I said she's gorgeous and I fell Here in town there's only she Who is beautiful as me So I'm making plans to woo and marry BelleGood morning, Belle! Wonderful book you have there.Well, not that one. But, you know. Books. For your dinner table. Shall I join you this evening?Busy?No, LeFou. It's the ones who play hard to get that are always the sweetest prey.That's what makes Belle so appealing. She hasn't made a fool of herself just to gain my favor. What would you call that?It's outrageously attractive, isn't it?You are the wildest, most beautiful thing I've ever seen. No one deserves you, but at least I know our children will be beautiful.What is it, LeFou?Oh well. It's hero time. I'm not done with you yet.Belle! Heard you had a little trouble with the headmaster. He never liked me, either. Can I give you a little advice about the villagers, though? They're never going to trust the kind of change we're trying to bring.The only children you should concern yourself with are... your own.Maybe you haven't met the right man.Maybe you should take another look. Some of us have changed.Belle, do you know what happens to spinsters in our village after their fathers die?They beg for scraps, like poor Agathe. This is our world, Belle. For simple folk like us, it doesn't get any better.Picture it, LeFou -- a rustic cabin. My latest kill roasting on the fire. Adorable children running around us while my love rubs my tired feet. But what does Belle say? \"I will never marry you, Gaston.\"A great hunter doesn't waste his time on rabbits.As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidatingI needed encouragement; thank you, LeFouYep.When I hunt, I sneak up with my quiver And beasts of the field say a prayer First I carefully aim for the liver Then I shoot from behind!I don't careI'M ESPECIALLY GOOD AT EXPECTORATING!When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs Ev'ry morning to help me get largeAnd now that I'm grown I eat five dozen eggs So I'm roughly the size of a barge!Who can make up these endless Refrains like Gaston?I use antlers in all of my decorating!Ah LeFou, you're the best. How is it that no girl has snatched you up yet?I'll help you, Maurice!Everyone! Stop making fun of this man at once!Don't thank me, Maurice. Lead us to the beast.Look, enough is enough. We have to turn back.I'm done playing this game of yours. Where is Belle?There are no such things as beasts, or talking teacups, or... magic! But there are wolves, frostbite, and starvation.So why don't we just turn around go back to Villeneuve? I'm sure Belle is at home, cooking up a lovely dinner...Because I want to marry your daughter! Now let's go home.IF YOU SAY BEAST ONE MORE TIME, I WILL FEED YOU TO THE WOLVES!Widows...Please, forgive me, old bean. That's no way to talk to my future father-in-law, now is it?If Maurice won't give me his blessing, then he is in my way. Once the wolves are finished with him, Belle will have no one to take care of her but me.Are you coming?Oh, Maurice! Thank heavens. I've spent the last five days trying to find you.Maurice, it's one thing to rave about your delusions. It's another to accuse me of attempted murder.Agathe? You'd hang your accusation on the testimony of a filthy hag? No offense, Agathe.You're right. Don't take my word for it.LeFou, my dearest companion, did I, your oldest friend and most loyal compatriot, try to kill the father of the only woman I've ever loved?Maurice, it pains me to say this, but you've become a danger to yourself and others. No wonder Belle ran away. You need help, sir. A place to heal your troubled mind.Everything's going to be fine.Have you ever seen the inside of a mad house, Maurice? You wouldn't last a week. Just give me your daughter's hand, and I'll set you free.Take him away!Belle, you know how loyal I am to your family, but your father has been making some unbelievable claims.We all admire your devotion to your father, but you'd say anything to free him. Your word is hardly proof.This is sorcery!Look at this beast. Look at his fangs, his claws.The monster has put her under a spell! If I didn't know better, I'd say she even cared for him.I have heard of the effects of dark magic, but never seen it with my own eyes before! This is a threat to our very existence!We can't have her running off to warn the beast. Lock her up too.DO YOU WANT TO BE NEXT? Fetch my horse.That creature will curse us all if we don't stop him! Well, I say we KILL THE BEAST!So it's time to take some action, boys It's time to follow me!Through the mist, through the wood Through the darkness and the shadows It's a nightmare but it's one exciting rideSay a prayer, then we're there At the drawbridge of a castle And there's something truly terrible inside It's a beast, he's got fangs razor sharp ones Massive paws, killer claws for the feast Hear him roar, see him foam But we're not coming home `Til he's dead, good and dead... KILL THE BEAST!Screw your courage to the sticking placeCall it war Call it threat You can bet they all will follow For in times like this they'll do just as I sayShow me the castle!Don't lose your nerve, LeFou.Sorry, old friend. It's hero time.Hello, beast. I am Gaston. Belle sent me.Were you in love with her? Did you honestly think she'd want you?Belle?When we return to the village, you will marry me, and the beast's head will hang on our wall!I'm coming for you, beast!No. Don't let me go. Please.
