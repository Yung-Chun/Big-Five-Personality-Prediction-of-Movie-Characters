Even with the trailer-trash veneer, she's strikingly beautiful.(stepping out of the trailer, hands on herAnother bad dream? He struggles for a moment, nods.It's just stress, Jeep, that's all. You do too much worryin'. About this place. About your dad.See what I mean? You're worried about a girl eight months pregnant and it isn't even your baby. Now that's enough to give anybody nightmares. Jeep turns away, dejected.C'mon, I was only kiddin'. You know how much I appreciate everything you and Bob are doing for me, but a month from now, this baby'll have a new family and I'll have to start thinkin' about what the hell I'm doin' with my life. This is not news Jeep wants to hear.Jeep, I'm not ready to be a mama. Christ, I can barely take care of myself as it is.You gotta stop carryin' the weight of the world on your shoulders. Jeep nods, tries to hide the fact that he's dying inside.Now can we go back in? I'm freezing my ass off out here.Guess I should think `bout quittin' then.You can buy a whole pack inside.Only if nowhere's right, `cause that's where you are.Bob'll probably let you use the diner phone if you ask him real nice...And pay `im somethin'.Yeah, we got a buttermilk stack for three seventy-five. We also got french toast for four dollars if you're into that. I personally like the pancakes though.Yeah, I'm okay. This guy's just lost. Jeep nods, uncertain, eyes Kyle another moment, then he shuffles along out of sight. Charlie brings the cigarette back up to her lips. An awkward beat.I hope Salem Lights are okay, `cause that's all we got left.Bob, do you see where am I right now? Can my condition really get any worse? `Sides, you ain't one to talk.Yeah, so why you still carryin' that fancy lighter `round for?That's for sure.Where do I start?Yeah, in the Fifties.Don't look like a test.Percy's right. I didn't feel nothing.Have a seat wherever you want, Ma'am. Specials are on the board.Okay, what'll it be?And how'd you like that cooked?Coming right up.Yeah.So they say. I'll be right back with your water. The old lady turns to the Andersons.Just about there.I wouldn't know.Out of sight. Out of mind.Nope. Gladys starts to dig in to the steak with a real ferociousness you wouldn't expect from an old lady. More FLIES begin to land on her body. On her food. Charlie is still trying to wave them away.No, I prefer it that way. I don't a need a man tellin' me what to do.I've got it under control.What did you just say?Go to hell, lady. She slaps the check down on the table and walks back toward the kitchen, passing Jeep and Bob.Total fucking Jesus freak. Gladys begins to laugh innocently as she continues to devour her meat. Red juice drips down her chin. The flies are swarming now. How did so many get in here? Sandra and Howard are mortified at this sudden turn of events.(nods, peakish, toOh, thank God, the police!We don't know anything. Nothing's working here. The TV, the radio, the phone... Michael just shakes his head.Let `em go! Michael's eyes flit momentarily in Charlie's direction. Considering her. The diner door opens and Percy steps cautiously out with hand and hook held up to show no threat. He's followed by Sandra and Audrey. Michael sees them, but offers no indication that he cares.Thanks...He brings them here and then he saves us from them? You're a genius, Bob. Bob falls silent, confounded. Audrey hesitantly approaches Michael.Me?! Why me?!No way! But Michael isn't joking and Charlie's laughter becomes genuine fear.Go fuck yourself, Bob!Look, this is not possible! I'm just a waitress! I'm nobody! I can't give birth to the Savior of Mankind! I don't even own a car!That can't be. I'm only eight months pregnant.It's coming soon, isn't it? Michael nods. Charlie sways on her feet. Jeep rests a hand on her shoulder, steadying her. With a CLANK Michael re-arms his weapon, turns to the group with finality.Percy? He takes a step forward, then falls to ground. The entire back side of his body is gone. Burned away.That can't be more than an hour up the highway from here.Hey... Jeep sees the strain on her face.You mean besides the fact that I just found out that I'm the mother of the Messiah? Jeep smiles, nods.Crazy thing is...I didn't want this baby. I even went down to the clinic, you know that? I remember sitting there in the waiting room, absolutely sure I was doin' the right thing...And that's when the feeling started. Like I was falling into the deepest, darkest hole imaginable. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't speak. I kept thinking this must be what death is like. And when finally they called my name, I ran.How come you have so much faith in me, Jeep? God knows I've never given you or anybody else a reason to. Or is it that you just can't find any other hard-luck case to follow around? Jeep's face hardens. He gets up. Hurt. Frustrated.We have to get `im back in here! Bob springs into action. Pushes the booth away from the front door. The sound of a gun COCKING. Bob looks over to see Michael pointing a gun at his head.Oh, no. Audrey... Out the window they see Audrey drop down from the roof and run towards Kyle.Do you have no heart?! She's just a kid! But he's immovable.You can't let her die! (grabbing a gun from theMichael!I'll get some water! Charlie dashes behind the counter to the sink. She fills up a pitcher of water. She turns away from the sink with the filled pitcher... And SCREAMS! The YOUNG BOY with the lifeless white eyes stands before her wielding an ENORMOUS BUTCHER'S KNIFE. The pitcher shatters LOUDLY on the floor. The boy swings the knife at her, slicing open the waitress outfit covering her pregnant belly. Charlie tumbles back to the ground behind the counter. She frantically pushes herself away from the approaching boy.Where is he?! That's when the electricity goes out once again, PLUNGING THEOh, no! Michael lowers his flashlight. CLEAR FLUID runs down Charlie's legs.I don't...I... Audrey looks to Michael, unsure.So are we safe now? Is it over?And what happens until then...?What makes you think I can do that? What makes you think I want to do that? If he's so important, why don't you take him?What's he talking about? The baby CRIES LOUDER.Michael, what the hell's he talking about?!Audrey...? Audrey moves to hand over the baby to Charlie...Give him to me!No... I... Sandra is almost to the front door.Wait! We can't leave him!Come on, Jeep!Is this what I think it is?Jeep, your arm! Jeep sees it, eyes go wide.What is it? A beat, as Jeep remembers Michael's parting words...The swarm, it's fading! Jeep looks back to the road as, sure enough, the FLY SWARM suddenly dissipates all around them, revealing a CLEAR VIEW of the highway ahead. Jeep knows at what price this good fortune has come.Look, I'm sorry for what I said to you earlier, `bout you following me around. I didn't mean it.C'mon, Jeep!Jeep! She kicks open her door and begins pulling him out.Alive.Nothing could have survived that.She saved us, Jeep. Audrey saved us. Now c'mon, we gotta go! Charlie, the baby bundled in her hands, leads Jeep away from the demolished Cruiser.How can this happen?How can this happen in a world so beautiful? Jeep follows her gaze to the sky. Endless stars. Confounding. Jeep shifts his eyes to the TOP OF THE RIDGE just ahead.Stop! Please! Don't kill him! But Gabriel is doing just that. Jeep is rapidly losing consciousness. The battle is lost.Stop it! I'LL GIVE YOU THE BABY! This gets Gabriel's attention. Charlie climbs to her feet, holding the bloody bundle out to him.I don't want this responsibility! Tears run down her face. She's dead fucking serious. Gabriel lets go of Jeep. He falls to the ground, gasping desperately for air.Yep, we sure did.

Everybody else does.So you're still going through with it...?I could help you. We could do it together, you know? I want to. Charlie smiles sadly at him, touched by his sweetness, but this just isn't where she's at.Go on. I'll be right there. Charlie kisses him on the cheek and heads back to the trailer. He watches her, longing in his eyes. With the clank of the door, she's gone. And over Jeep's troubled look, the perennial holiday cheer of FRANK CAPRA'S \"IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE\" MIXES up.You okay, Charlie? They both turn to see Jeep behind the diner, wearing mechanic's coveralls and holding a DUSTY OLD CRIB. Charlie quickly hides her cigarette behind her back. Busted.Yeah...Nothin'... Jeep tries feebly to block his path, fails. Bob looks down at the crib with dismay.Found it under a bunch of stuff in the storage shed. I know you never like to throw anything away... Bob considers him, softens.What...?Oh whatever, leave me alone.Don't say that about her! She's not like that!Look, I know it doesn't make any sense to you, but it's just something I have to do. Bob sighs, feels for his boy.C'mon Dad. You can't blame yourself for what she did--Damn it! He pulls himself up. Grease covers his face and hands. The sound of a CAR APPROACHING catches his attention. He watches as a beat up EIGHTIES CUTLASS SUPREME pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at the pumps. It's a mystery how anyone could see through the LAYER OF DUST on that windshield. After a moment the car door pops open and the LEGS OF AN ELDERLY WOMAN swing down to the ground, followed by the metal frame and wheels of a walker. The LITTLE OLD LADY gets out of the car, steadies herself on the walker, and then slowly makes her way toward the diner with the rickety frailness of an old turtle. Jeep watches her disappear inside. He then looks toward the horizon again. The WALL OF DARK CLOUDS are growing ever closer.The carburetor's shot. Don't know why. Looks brand new.I could try to rebuild it, but it'd take a while, and I don't think we have all the parts. If we call right now, we might be able to get a new one down here tomorrow morning.What? Across the diner, Charlie places a bloody red steak in front of Gladys.I couldn't pull the trigger. I froze. I saw what I needed to do, but I was afraid... She could've killed you!You guys!How `bout the trunk? They go around to the BACK OF THE CAR. Jeep slips the key in. The trunk POPS open, revealing a PILE OF DEAD CATS. ROTTING.(sees something up theWait a minute. Check it out. It's LAPD. What's an LA cop doing way out here? Bob and Jeep look over at Kyle.Charlie, wait! The men begin to run toward her... While out of the police car steps...No, shark teeth, Pop. Bob lowers the gun.C'mon, Dad, tell `em you're sorry. Tell `em you were only kidding! But Bob can't even speak, he's so scared. He squeezes his eyes closed.Dad, I can handle it.I said, I can handle it! Michael's eyes narrow, studying Jeep.Fuck it. And races after his father.Where is it?! Audrey shakes her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. She looks over at her mother. Sandra's eyes are closed. It's too much.You mean you're... Michael considers Jeep, then:You're sayin' she's the mother of the Messiah?What did you do...you know, before you came here...? Michael considers the question a beat, then:Well, what changed? What made you leave?So what happens to you...after this is over? Michael pauses a beat, as if unsure how much to say, then:We should get back out there...Red Rock...Guess it's your turn not to sleep. Charlie looks up to see Jeep sit down across from her.You okay?You shouldn't say things like that, Charlie. It isn't right. You'll get through this. I know you will. She turns to him, the bitterness overtaking her:You know, you're not the only who's suffered, okay? Let me know when you stop feeling sorry for yourself. And with that, Jeep walks away, leaving Charlie to stare after him, disturbed and surprised by his response.He's bleeding!Dad! Jeep can't get a clear shot. Bob's gasping for air. Michael grabs the boy and fiercely rips him off of Bob's back. He swings the boy around like a living shot put.She's never said. I just assumed it was Joe Danvers. You know how she's always had a thing for bad boys. Bob hears the spite in Jeep's voice.I thought you said I should move on?What was that...? The SPECTRAL LIGHTS dot the landscape now with untold numbers.We're not gonna make it outta here, are we? Bob looks at his son. The agony stretched across his face.Something's happening. They're moving away.Your orders... Michael looks at Jeep.You were the one who was supposed to kill the baby? That was the order you didn't obey. Michael nods grimly. Charlie looks urgently at Michael.No! With a sweep of his hand, Gabriel sends Bob flying across the diner where he crashes down behind the counter near the stove. Michael GRABS JEEP'S HAND before the boy can rush back into the fray.Me?! What about you?But I don't know what to do!Prophets? What Prophets? What instructions?! And that's when Jeep opens his hand to find the KEYS to Michael's Police Cruiser. Jeep looks up from the keys to see Charlie, Audrey and the baby. The responsibility crashing in on him. Then he closes his hand around the keys, determination building.C'mon!We have no choice! We have to get to Red Rock! He pulls Charlie past the counter toward the back office. Jeep stops when he sees his father's broken body lying on the ground by the stove in a pool of his own blood. Bob's half open eyes focus on his son. In his outstretched hand is that goddamn ZIPPO LIGHTER... and next to that, a BROKEN GAS PIPE leading to the stove. Jeep is terrified.Dad! Jeep tries to help him up.But Dad...! Bob smiles weakly at his son and says simply:I'm trying! Jeep gives it some gas, but the ENGINE'S NOT CATCHING. A DARK SHAPE POUNCES ONTO THE HOOD OF THE CAR. The light catches it, revealing the disfigured face and beard of a SHOPPING MALL SANTA CLAUS, his oversized belly gruesomely distended. Charlie screams.Fuck! Jeep pumps the gas and the ENGINE BURSTS TO LIFE! The creature's about to punch a fist through the glass(throwing the car inOkay, we need to figure out our weapon situation. Hopefully Michael didn't take everything out of the car. Jeep places his Glock on the dash. He sees that he's got a police issue shotgun in the front seat rack. Charlie searches under her seat. Pulls out a...GRENADE.Yes. Now just put it down... Slowly. Charlie places it onto the seat. Audrey fishes around in the backseat.Okay. Okay. Handgun. Shotgun. A a flare gun... And a grenade. Alright. Load this.Try real hard, okay? Audrey anxiously sets about loading the flare gun.I can't fuckin' see! Charlie's desperately trying to soothe her SCREAMING baby. ON THE AIR VENTS as FLIES start crawling in.Oh, no.The instructions...Thank you...Oh, shit!No...It's just starting...Better not hold him too long. Might get attached. Charlie looks over, feels his lingering anger.Nothin' to be sorry about. It's true. I did follow you around. At least now I know there was a good reason. Charlie's reacts, a bit stung. Jeep tries to hide his pleasure that the tables have turned at least a little. Charlie is about to respond when Audrey leans in from the back seat.Okay, all we gotta do is --Duck! BLAM! Gabriel takes one in the shoulder, but it doesn't slow him down.Audrey, the flare gun! Audrey desperately tries to load a flare while avoiding Gabriel's grasp. Jeep can't get off another shot without the risk of hitting Audrey. Gabriel is almost entirely in the car now. Audrey swings the flare gun toward Gabriel, but he knocks her hand aside just as she pulls the trigger and the flare goes off INSIDE THE CAR! Jeep ducks. The CAR SWERVES MADLY. The flare RICOCHETS through the cabin, lighting it up like the Fourth of July! Gabriel lunges for Charlie just as the flare bounces off the windshield - PING! - and nails him right in the face, SETTINGGet down on the floor! Charlie pushes herself and the baby down on the floor in front of the passenger seat. Jeep PUNCHES IT. The speedometer leaps ahead.The baby?And what about...What?C'mon, we're almost there. They are only a few steps from the EDGE OF THE RIDGE when --Charlie, no! Gabriel takes the bundle from Charlie, turning away from her.We made it.I'm sure they're just over the next ridge.

Cleanin' up the messes she makes while she steps out with every guy around here other than you?! Jeep stiffens. Turns to his father:You really think she's gonna stick around here after that baby's born and off her hands? Jeeps shakes his head, burns.See that up there? Your mother thought I was crazy for wanting to buy this place, middle of nowhere...But I just knew this was what I was supposed to do. Told your mom, \"just wait.\" Told her when they finally ran the freeway through here like they were plannin' on, this place would be like Grand Central Station.Yeah, I can. And I'm sayin' you're about to make the same damn mistake I made, believing in something that's never gonna happen...Or someone.Now get to work on that truck. I wanna have these people on the road by nightfall. Bob walks back into the diner. Jeep is about to turn back to the garage when he notices something off in the distance. Ominous DARK CLOUDS line the horizon to the south like a living wall. He shifts his gaze up the highway to the north. Same thing. DARK CLOUDS are pushing their way over the distant mountains. A storm is coming.(holding up a silencingWhat's wrong with you today?What the hell do I need that crap for?I got all the history I can take.What's your problem now?You know this was the top-of-the- line model when I bought it.You shouldn't be watchin' anyways. Okay, baby, this is gonna do it. Bob gives the TV one final wallop -- WHACK! And the picture snaps into FOCUS. Only it isn't the picture he was expecting. The STARK GRAPHIC OF THE EMERGENCY BROADCASTING SYSTEM and its accompanying HOLLOW TONE fill the diner. Everybody in the place stops and turns to the TV.See? Clear as day.It's just one of those test things. That'd be true, except for the words at the bottom of the screen, which read:In the back past the kitchen. Make it fast. Kyle hustles passed Percy. Charlie is standing by the Anderson's table, clearing dishes. Everybody's eyes are locked on the TV.Hey, Percy, give that old radio of yours a shot. Maybe they got some news about the TV. Percy grabs an old battery powered radio off a kitchen shelf. Switches it on. STATIC. He spins the dial until he reaches a clear signal. The same HOLLOW TONE of Emergency Broadcasting. Station after station the same thing. The diner is overwhelmed by a chilling chorus of HOLLOW TONES. Everyone goes very still.Not if it was centered in the desert.Yeah, `cause of the radiation they give off.Well, for cryin' out loud. There's no use in speculating. I'll just call my brother up in Needles. He must a heard something.Whaddya talkin' about?You're shittin' me. Kyle shakes his head, sits down at the counter.Relax, Mrs. Anderson. Nothing to get excited about. Probably just working on the lines.(glances over at theThat's not gonna happen. Goddamn phone's out.What happened?Don't move! But Gladys not only moves, SHE SCURRIES RIGHT UP THE FUCKING(struggles to cock theThe fuck was that?! What the fuck was that!?

Her adult facade giving way to that of a frightened child A DROP OF RED HITS AUDREY'S CHEEK, causing her to look up and see Gladys's TRAIL OF BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THE CEILING. An ungodly horror.I don't understand how she was still standin' after Percy hit `er with that goddamn fryin' pan. Broke her fuckin' neck. I saw it. I swear I did.It's okay, Jeep. It's okay. But for Jeep it's not okay. He's hurting real bad inside.There's nothin' to be ashamed of, Jeep.(catching Percy by theThe hell you need that for?!She's cold as a freakin' ice cube. If I hadn't just seen her walk in here, I'd say the old bag's been dead for hours. Bob rolls Gladys over, revealing her face -- her enlarged mouth filled with dozens of razor sharp baby teeth.I don't get it. Why don't they come closer?You see anything?Careful. Old lady could have some kind of rabid poodle locked up in there. Jeep slowly swings the door open and that's when the smell hits them.Jesus. Kyle opens the passenger door, looks in. Dark, dirty. But nothing unusual.Least now we know where that smell was coming from.Okay, now we're talkin'.Give me the shotgun. Kyle hands the shotgun over to Bob.Take one step closer and I'll drop you right here. A long beat as Michael considers Bob. Icy cold.Mister, after what we've been through here today, you're lucky we didn't shoot you first and greet you later. Now let me see your teeth. Michael stares at him blankly.Your teeth goddamn it! Lemme see `em! Michael offers up a dangerous smile, revealing a not so well kept but definitely normal set of teeth. Bob and the others ease slightly.Okay... Suppose you tell us your name then.Sorry about all that, Michael. This old lady just went crazy inside my place here. She had these teeth. Never seen anything like `em. Practically bit a man in half. Michael remains silent. Doesn't seemed shocked in the least by what he's heard.So what are you doin' out here? Gotta say you don't exactly look like a police officer. Even one from L.A. Then again, you have to be, right? I mean, who the hell'd be crazy enough to steal a cop car? Bob chuckles for a moment. When Michael doesn't respond in kind, Bob falls silent. Anxious. He slowly raises the shotgun again. Michael sizes up this raggedy group. His gaze drifts over to the loosely wrapped body in front of the diner. The plastic table cloth flaps wildly in the wind. Turning back to Bob:Back off, fella...Wait. I don't think that's such a good idea.He's just a kid --C'mon, Jeep. We gotta go!Jeep, get the flashlights!Alright, Rambo. You got us up here. Now you mind explaining what the fuck we're fighting? Michael is about to answer, when:Yeah...The hell is that? The CALLIOPE MUSIC grows louder, the melody more distinct. Now we recognize the song: SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN. But instead of filling them with cheer, it fills them with dread.Shells! Percy tosses him a box of shells. But Bob fumbles the catch and the box slides halfway down the sloped roof.Fuck! With the gun still in one hand, Bob reaches frantically down for the ammo. Stretching... Further...Gun!(jamming the gun in herPull me up! Percy extends his hook hand, helping Bob ascend to safety.Hold on. (approaches Michael,Right and yesterday I was the fuckin' Easter Bunny. You know, fuck this. I don't even believe in God.How do we know he didn't bring them here himself?Wait a minute, isn't Mary supposed to be a vi--On the house. She looks up at him. Smiles weakly. Takes a sip.You hungry?Well I figure just cuz the world's coming to an end, it doesn't mean a man's gotta starve. All I can say is thank heavens they left the gas on. Sandra takes another sip of beer. Considers it.Just gimme another minute with him, okay? Jeep nods, quietly leaves his father at the side of his dead friend.What the hell are you talkin' about? This is our chance!We back in business?Jesus Christ, what the hell is that boy doin'!Damn it all to hell!Get back! BURSTING OUT OF THE FLAMES, Michael marches confidently into the diner. Jeep slams the door CLOSED just as the WALL OFWhat the fuck?What a way to bring a child into the world. She ever tell you his name?Jeep, sooner or later she'll realize you're the best thing that's ever happened to her.Can't a father be wrong sometimes? Jeep considers Bob with a smile, then comes the sound... A DEEP, LONG, BODY RUMBLING TONE rising up off the plain, as if emanating from the largest HORN ever constructed.I'm sorry Jeep. This shouldn't be happening to you... Jeep rests a comforting hand on his father's shoulder. Bob pulls his son close and hugs him with all his might, tears filling his eyes.Who?Don't do it, lady!Sonuvabitch! Bob charges at the creature, sub-machine gun blazing. Gabriel reacts by instantly UNFOLDING HIS WINGS and launching himself into the air. The bullets clawing up the wall behind him. But Bob's heroic move has given Jeep time to get up and run with the baby for the back of the diner. He thrusts the child into Charlie's hands. And without even thinking, she pulls the child protectively to her chest.Leave me, Jeep. My place is here, remember?Run. And so Jeep, fighting back tears, does what his father says.Sorry... We're closed.

He spots the truck stop diner just up the road ahead...Darren, your fuckin' directions suck, man. He checks his cell phone again. No chance of a signal way out here. So he shuffles around to the side of the diner in search of a pay phone. The good news is that he finds one. The bad news is that it's been broken for ten years. Leaning next to the broken phone, however, is Charlie wearing a shabby, faded WAITRESS uniform stretched tight around her very pregnant belly. Adding to her perfect mother-to-be look is that cigarette dangling from her lips. The plastic name tag pinned to her chest says \"CHARLIE\".Hey... She eyes him, mildly intrigued, takes a drag.You know that shit right there ain't good for the baby. She lets out a long slow exhale.Now hold on, girl, let me bum one before you do.Tell ya what. You let me have one of yours, and I'll give you two from the new pack you're gonna sell me. She considers him for a moment, then pulls out a cigarette. Lights it off the end of hers then hands it to him. Kyle takes a drag, pulls out his crumpled map.Am I in the right place?Sonuvabitch. There another phone around here? You know, one that works?I can handle that. You got pancakes here?Three seventy-five, huh?If I can smoke `em, I'll take `em.Hey man? Bob turns to Kyle. Doesn't like what he sees.Can I use your phone? My cell doesn't get a signal out here and the pay phone outside is busted. Bob is about to respond when:Yo, am I the Invisible motherfuckin' Man here? Do you have a phone or not? Kyle peels a five dollar bill off a serious WAD OF CASH. That gets Bob's attention. Bob snaps the money out of his hand.Let me talk to him...Cuz a father should be able to talk to his son, that's why. Now put `im on the phone. Is that my little man...? Yeah, well I'm working hard, so that I can be with you. You bein' good? (strange STATIC can beWhat the hell... He keeps trying. Nothing.I don't think so. Kyle has reappeared in the diner.Phone's dead. Just tried to make a call.Press your hands over the hole! Sandra looks fearfully up at Kyle, at the gun still in his hand.Don't look at me like that, lady! I'm tryin' to fuckin' help you! Now put your goddamn hands over the hole before your husband bleeds to death! Obeying, she cups her hands over the hole in his neck, desperately trying to stop the flow of blood leaking out between her fingers. Percy scrambles over with a first-aid kit and together he and Kyle get to work on Howard's neck.How far to the hospital?They're fuckin' clouds! What the fuck do they look like?Well, I don't care how long she's been dead, the bitch ain't stayin' in here with us.How the fuck am I supposed to know, man? You askin' me to explain the behavior of a motherfuckin' pestilence. A CLANK and Jeep notices the old lady's car keys have dropped to the ground.No Twilight Zone shit if that's what you mean. Jeep slips the key into the driver's side door. Unlocks it.Agh! What the fuck is that? Bob covers his nose.Nothin' here.Bitch's got motherfuckin' dead cats in her hoopty! What the fuck is wrong with white people?!Yeah, it was a real motherfuckin' necessity we figured that out, man.I'm from Nevada, man. They consider the police car a moment more. See the SHATTERED PASSENGER WINDOW, the BLOOD STAINS.Know what?Easy! Easy! Michael's expression is totally calm. Merciless.What the--? Michael turns, sees the lights.Now that we're locked in here, what the fuck are we supposed to do? A flicker of LIGHT. And then FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CUT THROUGH THE DARKNESS...coming to rest on Michael's pale face. Michael looks up at the ceiling.Where the hell did they go? Bob turns to Michael sharply.Ice cream. TWO HEADLIGHTS appear in the darkness. And sure enough, an ICE CREAM TRUCK rolls slowly toward the diner. The EERIE CALLIOPE MUSIC emanates from a speaker on its roof. It's too dark to see who's behind the wheel.You've got to be fuckin' kidding me.Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. That's when the Ice Cream Man's JAW UNHINGES, STRETCHINGIs that it? Not even close. A RUMBLING OF ENGINES. HEADLIGHTS. A freeway full of VEHICLES of every variety punch through the wall of dust, racing toward the diner. They are THEThey're running! We got `em! Kyle turns happily to Michael. Gone. Kyle looks around the roof with alarm.We got `em runnin'! Then Kyle notices the broken window, takes in the room, his excitement falling.Where's Howard? No one responds. Sandra and Audrey are huddled together. Crying. Bob and Percy follow Kyle in, still shaking from the adrenaline.I'll go. Bob grabs Kyle's arm.Possessed by what? Demons?So what, we're supposed to just hold those things off until Mary over there squeezes one out?Oh we're fucked. We are so fucked!Okay, what's your plan?You were in the Army?What was it like? Being in a war?What?No. I uh -- keep it for protection.From people. Percy looks at him skeptically.Yeah, people who might try to give me a hard time, you know?Yeah, well, no, not regular, regular people.I'm talkin' people whose job it is to give other people a hard time. Kinda person who doesn't get enough fiber in their diet, you know what I'm sayin?Exactly. Strictly business.Who the fuck are you to be sweatin' me, man? I got my reasons for doin' what I do. Percy just stares at him, penetrating. Finally:...Then you just flip this -- Audrey flips the safety.I bet they did. After a moment, Audrey switches the safety back on. Hands the gun over to Kyle. Audrey stares into the red nothingness surrounding them. Her expression growing distant. She seems to have aged years overnight.Yeah?The only time my old man ever paid attention to me was when I was doing somethin' bad. So you know what I did?I got really good at being bad. She smiles at this confession. Can obviously relate. He wipes a tear from her cheek. She leans in. Kisses him. Passionately. Desperately. His hands trace over her body. She claws at him. Her passion growing out of control. She's practically devouring him. Kyle can barely keep up. It's like something else beyond sensual need has taken over. She moves down his chest. Further. Kyle leans his head back. Further. Just then the SPOT LIGHTS that illuminate the roof sign come to life. The young couple stops to look up at the brilliant red word \"Paradise\" illuminated above them. Down below, the gas pumps LIGHT UP. The station's FLUORESCENTS flicker on.I don't know. HEADLIGHTS appear on the highway.You better get downstairs.Just in case. The headlights become a FAMILY MINIVAN careening wildly off the highway to stop at the pumps.Get ready. They aim their weapons at the vehicle. A well dressed MAN in his mid-thirties jumps out of the car. He looks around nervously, scared. Then, seeing that the coast is clear, he offers a calming wave to his WIFE and YOUNG BOY who wait anxiously for him inside the car.Wait a minute.It's a trap. They saw them coming and turned on the lights. It's a fucking trap! Kyle and Audrey wave their arms frantically at the family.I got you! Kyle moves on to the mother. But something odd is happening. The creatures have stopped coming at him. In fact, they're just standing there watching him. Waiting. Kyle freezes. CLOSE ON HIM as he senses something terribly wrong.", "clean_line": "shit spots truck stop diner road ahead darren fuckin directions suck man checks cell phone chance signal way shuffles diner search pay phone good news finds bad news broken years leaning broken phone charlie wearing shabby faded waitress uniform stretched tight pregnant belly adding perfect mother look cigarette dangling lips plastic tag pinned chest says charlie hey eyes mildly intrigued takes drag know shit right ain good baby lets long slow exhale hold girl let bum tell ya let ll new pack gonna sell considers moment pulls cigarette lights end hands kyle takes drag pulls crumpled map right place sonuvabitch phone know works handle got pancakes seventy huh smoke em ll em hey man bob turns kyle like sees use phone cell signal pay phone outside busted bob respond yo invisible motherfuckin man phone kyle peels dollar wad cash gets bob attention bob snaps money hand let talk cuz father able talk son im phone little man yeah working hard bein good strange static bewhat hell keeps trying think kyle reappeared diner phone dead tried press hands hole sandra looks fearfully kyle gun hand look like lady tryin fuckin help goddamn hands hole husband bleeds death obeying cups hands hole neck desperately trying stop flow blood leaking fingers percy scrambles aid kit kyle work howard neck far hospital fuckin clouds fuck look like care long dead bitch ain stayin fuck supposed know man askin explain behavior motherfuckin pestilence clank jeep notices old lady car keys dropped ground twilight zone shit mean jeep slips key driver door unlocks agh fuck bob covers nose nothin bitch got motherfuckin dead cats hoopty fuck wrong white people yeah real motherfuckin necessity figured man nevada man consider police car moment shattered passenger window blood stains know easy easy michael expression totally calm merciless michael turns sees lights locked fuck supposed flicker light flashlight beams cut darkness coming rest michael pale face michael looks ceiling hell bob turns michael sharply ice cream headlights appear darkness sure ice cream truck rolls slowly diner eerie calliope music emanates speaker roof dark wheel ve got fuckin kidding oh shit oh shit oh shit ice cream man jaw unhinges stretchingis close rumbling engines headlights freeway vehicles variety punch wall dust racing diner thethey running got em kyle turns happily michael gone kyle looks roof alarm got em runnin kyle notices broken window takes room excitement falling howard responds sandra audrey huddled crying bob percy follow kyle shaking adrenaline ll bob grabs kyle arm possessed demons supposed hold things mary squeezes oh fucked fucked okay plan army like war uh protection people percy looks skeptically yeah people try hard time know yeah regular regular people talkin people job people hard time kinda person fiber diet know sayin exactly strictly business fuck sweatin man got reasons doin percy stares penetrating finally flip audrey flips safety bet moment audrey switches safety hands gun kyle audrey stares red nothingness surrounding expression growing distant aged years overnight yeah time old man paid attention somethin bad know got good bad smiles confession obviously relate wipes tear cheek leans kisses passionately desperately hands trace body claws passion growing control practically devouring kyle barely like sensual need taken moves chest kyle leans head spot lights illuminate roof sign come life young couple stops look brilliant red word paradise illuminated gas pumps light station fluorescents flicker know headlights appear highway better downstairs case headlights family minivan careening wildly highway stop pumps ready aim weapons vehicle dressed man mid thirties jumps car looks nervously scared seeing coast clear offers calming wave wife young boy wait anxiously inside car wait minute trap saw coming turned lights fucking trap kyle audrey wave arms frantically family got kyle moves mother odd happening creatures stopped coming fact standing watching waiting kyle freezes close senses terribly wrong"}}}
