What did Little Eddie ever do to...Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand.If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.

Police?I don't believe this. I've been out forty seconds...Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable... Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.Looks like you've been expanding your...My next word was gonna be \"consciousness.\" Swear to God... tubby.That's your definition of \"Hard?\"Three minutes, 51 seconds.Not anymore. Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's. Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino. What the hell's a Nintendo?The man knows, the man knows!Oh, not much. Mario Brothers want me to do a job.Ah, had the perfect amount of foam. Just get me to the bar... It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....I read about these people in Newsweek. Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe? Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph? Captain Bob's steering wheel?This is Pizza? Reindeer Goat cheese? I admit, I've been known to go wild and order a Canadian Bacon in my time, but..Can you take a sunrise and sprinkle it with dew?The Candy Man can, Felix. You know, I thought this was a country where you could do any stupid thing you wanted; drive to work naked, make love to a V.C.R. Guess I'm wrong. Maybe that's why I became a serial arsonist.The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.What job?The only thing you can't do is get sex for free. I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to stop me from committing crimes. You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.How was I supposed to know they were women? Besides one of them was bald and kept saying \"Soitinly.\"Yes.Uh, yeah. Cut to the chase.What else do you got under there ... I don't want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame.Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look at this.It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....The safe's a Simpson 71. Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing? Where's the want ads? Gonna sell some spatulas.This isn't funny. I'm not into this. I...You're not...LISTENING!I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates. Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.

Haven't you ever heard of stamp collecting, or curling?I'm a bum.Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.Cameras?Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...5:32. \"Swinging on a Star.\"\"A mule is an animal with long funny ears.\"\"Or would you rather swing on a star, carry moonbeams home in a jar.\"\"Or would you rather be a fish?\"\"A fish is annuh nan na nan na brook.\"And though he's slippery, he still gets caught.\"\"And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo.\"What am I doing here?

Gates just had his tonsils taken out. The hard way.The Butler did it. Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head. He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.\"Attempted.\" At-tempt-ted! I'm not happy about having to steal that horse, but I do have my pride. Face it, when it comes to burglary, and sex, I....Boing. Uh, this I don t understand...Because I'm tired of not understanding things. Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up.Alex, my man, it's time to play a little offense. Where's your tux?All these years of attending auctions, I still get goosebumps. The paintings, the sculptures....the things that aren't really paintings or sculptures...I couldn't agree more.

I think that auctioneer landed at La Guardia.Neither's flossing.Life don't get much better than this.This is the worst night...No shit.Don't I know you...Bastard, you're going to need another nose!But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.To what do I owe the dishonor of a reunion, you centrally intelligent scumsicle.Three minutes, twenty-three seconds. If you think I'm doing another...Employer? The president?I'm supposed to fall for that?No. Way.Yes way.You could host American Bandstand in here. Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?My life is not some deal. I...Whatever. You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads. You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right. I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is. Man, why didn't you just buy the horse? What am I saying, you did buy it...If you're pausing for a \"thank you,\" give it up. So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?I guess that's a no.Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.Alfred, you're a very polite psychopath, but if you...Think he's already got today's ball-balls. Five more minutes please, it's been so long...Anybody have a cigarette? But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison. I don't care anymore. I hope you have the receipts for the threads.You wouldn't risk the dime to call the police. You have no proof.I'm robbing the Vatican. The nuns at St. Agnes predicted that I'd end up doing this...Excuse me, I'm being blackmailed into robbing the Vatican by a psychotic American corporation along with a CIA...Forget it, man. Go tackle a jaywalker.Operator, I want to make a collect call to Alex Messina, New York....Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...That's what you theenk.Never, why do you ask?Whoa. Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment...Could you believe that crazy elephant?Whoa, part 2. Does it go to Times Square?The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.Oh, you read that.You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.God, I wish I could say the same thing. What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....And I'll bring my entourage...Said.Hello, operator. I'd like to make a collect call to New York number...Thank you, operator, thank you.Come on, Alex, pick up, you Reindeer goat cheese-eating motherfucker.A-lex, A-lex, come on Alex.Why George, you big softie...You know Kaplan, if you weren't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived, I'd feel sorry for you.Tonight?

They even got the CIA involved!Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...This doesn't taste like cappuccino.Shucks, I'll just take it back.Another piece of the puzzle for the Da Vinci Alchemy project.Just browsing. Don't touch me....Oh weeeeelly, don't hurt me? Even if I do this....And this....Surely this must offend....Things are getting a little loose at the Da Vinci workshop tonight. \"Put your left leg in, take your right foot out.\" May I call you Minnie....Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....Two minutes, 35 seconds. Damnit, I'm involved in this thing, so I just wanna know what this thing is. I wanna be treated as an adult.That's two down to Kitty Carlisle...Alchemy.Sure. The Kremlin. Makes sense. The Kremlin. Why not? Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man. Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...You want an address on that last one?Bunny, not you too?I'll kill all you. Even the old lady.You bastard! You fucked my freedom for a lousy job!No.....Alex! Wake up, you can't go out like this.You bastard. You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of my life. What was your per-diem?And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman. I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.Oh. Well, what's this?You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.You better believe I can. I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.Selfish attitude? I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...The world is beautiful. Every day in prison I made sure to remember that. It's only when I actually got out that I forgot. If I was sane, I'd be on that plane to Rio. But being beaten and abused to fulfill some corporation's perverted vision does something to your mental health. The world is beautiful and I'm tired of being fucked. It's Darwin and Minerva's turn to bite the pillow...Rio, Alex? After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.Fits my new image. A thief for the masses. This is one job I'm not going to feel guilty about enjoying. Gum.Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain. All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was \"Who Shot J.R.?\"Yeah, I mean, come on, going through the Iron Curtain is supposed to be crawling underneath barbed wire, it's supposed to be strangling a guard...It's supposed to be parachuting in the moonlight....Count of three?Okay.Oh-Eee-Oh-A-Whoa-Oh.Three. Oh. Oh. \"Side by Side.\"\"Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money.Don't worry, we'll get it...Uh, I guess so.\"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt\"That was close....You can be lookout!.....

I gotta get Anna. Hang in there...But you're going to tell us anyway...If you think you're getting past me...Don't be stupid...they...Just shut up and hit me!Damnit, I hate this! I'm a cat burglar! Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.Let's just forget it, I mean...Oh, come on....Why does this have to be so hard...Take this to Hell with you...Wow, this is really gonna hurt the resale value...Oh, honey....We did it man, we...I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...This is too bad to be false.Last rites, sister?She killed Alex.You killed a friend. Why should I help you go for the gold?Except yours-yours.

A polite push, perhaps? A clear shout of \"watch out, Anna\" would have done nicely...Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?But it is his gift as an inventor who drew together science and art that is most incredible.Tough guy. What are you--How's your head.As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.Question, sir?

The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals. It's actually not that an unusual set-up. The secret passageway on the other hand....Nice. But right out of our brochure.Actually I wrote it. It's a good sentence. It can apply to people.I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls. And I buy my own clothes. My life's a little boring...I'll bring my entire repertoire...Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to. There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's. Say 10:30.Father, it's obvious. He's up to something.Yes, sir.No, your Eminence. I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.That's the best kind. A wise woman once said \"Polite conversation is rarely either.\"Yeah. The big E.Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....Prison?How long were you in?Wow, you were \"in the joint.\" \"Doing hard time.\" It's funny, but that excites me. I seem to have a thing for sinners.Yes. Something to go.What have you been doing?Oh, I'm so sorry...I'm sorry. I can't. I....It's also been a long time for me. I--Somebody robbed the Vatican.You really went and did it. With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it. Nobody does it better, Hudson. You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.What are your plans for the weekend? Hoisting away the Colosseum? Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces. Their Sforza replica was as fake as the \"gas leak\" that supposedly destroyed it.The C.I. what? God, no...Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.Why didn't you tell me at the restaurant that he had hit the Vatican tonight. My people will not be happy. I want to see Kaplan.When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...Actually George, it's not it. What are we doing in this castle? I happen to know the Mayflowers bought this castle last year when they found out Da Vinci used to do...Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some \"neat\" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.Cat got his tongue?How sweet. I trust you will see Hudson Hawk is given to the proper authorities. I recommend leniency...Forgive me Father for I have sinned. It's been 1200 hours since my last confession.I betrayed a man. A good man. An innocent man. A thief.He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure. But he knew Right and Wrong. Oh, and we kind of messed around...A little petting is not the issue!You got it. Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline. I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.I'm going to find out.I know, I know, your Eminence, just say \"God go with me.\"Oh thank God, you're dead...Hudson, don't you understand...I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization. The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...Where did you get this?It's from the machine. All they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already. We can't let that happen.Something like that.Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...It's that kind of selfish attitude that...You re not \"some guy\" anymore, Hudson. Right now, you're the only guy. Without your help, I....That was beautiful.Ketchup. Stupido Americani...Uh, yeah. Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.
