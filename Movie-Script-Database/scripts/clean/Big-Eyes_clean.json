She gets busy, penciling in LARGE OVAL EYES. Then -- quick marks for the mouth and nose. Impatient, Jane spies on Walter's canvas.Hey! Your canvas is blank!A-hem!I remember when Momma painted that. Huh? Suddenly, Margaret freezes. She hadn't anticipated this. Margaret looks to Walter. He stares back, waiting.Sure I'm sure! It was in our old apartment, and you had me sit on a stool in the kitchen --No, Mother did! Look! I'm wearing my blue dress.Well you did a really good job.Mom! I wanna come in.Let me in! What are you doing in there? Why's the door always locked?Who's that?Take the bed. I can sleep on theDo you live far away?But you never see Walter?Does he talk about me?Yeah, mine's the same.I have some peanut butter hidden in my sock drawer. Do you wanna eat it? Lily smiles: Sure. Jane opens a drawer and removes a jar of Skippy. The two girls sit on the floor, happily eating the peanut butter with their fingers.Go, Rembrandt! Get the ball! She tumbles, and Rembrandt licks her ear. She giggles.Can I come? No. I can never come. No! I shouldn't even ask. Jane glares glumly. Margaret peers hopelessly at her daughter... then goes inside.Mom, what's for dinner?Mom... I know.I'm not a child anymore.Ow!Mom, what are we gonna do??! Margaret thinks.But where are we going?Really...? Margaret smiles softly. We slowly PUSH IN to her.No, I'm gonna surf with the gang. Margaret tightens up.That's right!

I have a daughter to support.I studied at the Watkins Art Institute in Nashville, then took Illustration classes in New York. Here's a pastel I did... here's some fashion design... a portrait in charcoal... though I enjoy mixing mediums, preferably oil and ink... She's alive, enthused. The guy shakes his head.Deirdre, look at you!\"Dee-Ann\"?!Jane -- is swell. She's started in a sweet little school.Do they only show Modern?What's espresso?Today's a special: Two dollars.All finished. Her customers gape, impressed. She smiles. The guy counts out four quarters, then happily leaves.I'm just glad they liked it.M-Margaret... Mmm. He grins, checking her out... her loose sexy blouse and tight black capris. She flushes.Wouldn't you rather flirt with those dolls over there?Mr. Ulbrich is out of the picture...!I can't believe you lived in Paris.I've never even been on an airplane.You're a romantic.I've never acted freely. I was the daughter. The wife. The mother...Walter, I'd bet you could paint anything.This is moving fast. You're my first date in a long time... Neither of them speaks. The tension builds -- There is a spark between them...Sweetie, could you stop fidgeting?Jane! Don't bother Mr. Keane. You know creativity has to well up from the inside...I believe things can be seen in eyes. They're the windows of the soul --Eyes are how I express my emotions. That's how I've always drawn them.What was that??You're a -- Realtor?And you're... ashamed?He told the court Jane doesn't have a proper home. It's beyond my abilities as a single woman... Margaret trails off, shaken. Walter gulps unsurely. Then, he takes her in his arms. We\"Hawaii\"? M-marriage?You're right... this is paradise. Only God could make those colors.Oh, can't we stay here forever??This is a waterfall... the air was so fresh you could taste it. Here's an ancient altar... that statue is Kane, the god of creation. I said a prayer to him. Oh! Here's Walter and Janie, building a sandcastle -- Dee-Ann raises an eyebrow.You're talking about my husband!I'm not naive. Well, I am naive. But I know the man I'm marrying. Walter can act rash... but he's a good provider. And he's wonderful with Jane.\"You are on the threshold of untold success.\"I think people buy art because it touches them --I've never posted bail before. Silence. He has no idea what to say. His aplomb crumbles.Since when are you thin-skinned? Artists have to handle criticism.I don't understand. Why would you do such a thing?!Don't ever do it again.There must be two-hundred dollars...Walter, they take at least a week. There's layering, shading --Mrs. Cava, I'm sorry to bother you so late... but would you mind watching Jane?Walter...? He spins -- shocked at her presence.Why are you lying? For once, Walter has no answer. She bores in, emotions racing. Confused. Hurt.You're taking credit for something that isn't yours. He looks ill. Wheels spinning, looking for an out --Those children are part of my being!They couldn't meet me, because you told me to stay home!!I'm glad you can dash off your pieces without any emotional connection...!Don't you mean... one of your good ones?What about... honesty?But... isn't it strange? Artists get shown. They don't build their own galleries.Are you -- sure? That was a long time ago.L-lots of girls have that dress... Margaret trails off, sickened. Not knowing how to lie. Walter takes charge. He kneels, then smiles gently at Jane.Hello. I've -- never really done this before. I'm not sure how you...I lied to my child. Pause.My husband... he pressured me into doing it.Ummm, no. I don't think of him that way. I mean, he likes to tell stories... maybe he exaggerates a little... but he's a good man.\"Harm\"?? Oh! Not at all.N-no. That's not what --Well... he's more established.Thanks for coming. Margaret grabs a drink and hurries away. Dee-Ann stands there, irked. Margaret cuts over to Walter. We MOVE IN TIGHT ON THE COUPLE. He grins and grabs her.I don't... know.Uhh, you can't. Mommy's busy.Maybe I'm lightheaded from the turpentine. I've been in here all day.Do you -- like it?You're going to be on television?!Maybe you have an unhealthy obsession with little girls.Walter... art is personal. Walter picks up a picture of TWO LITTLE GIRLS IN TUTUS. He stares, perplexed.What about your Paris street scenes? Why do you paint those?And was it really all sun-dappled streets and flower vendors? Huh? Walter stares off at the Waifs. They peer out from broken windows... chain-link fences... And then -- he gets it.What time is it?I've been... busy.No --! It's just... something I'm working on. It's not for the world. Walter gives her a funny look.No, please! Walter, it's -- personal.Yes it is.It's a self-portrait. Beat.I thought... maybe... I could sign it myself. Hmm. Walter's eyes narrow.Yes, I know... but... when people ask me if I paint, I don't know what to answer! I just want the pride of being able to say -- that's mine. Walter's wheels are ratcheting.Nobody!No! NOBODY saw it!I KNOW! My God! I live with this every minute of my life!C'mon! You haven't picked up a brush in months! We used to paint together! Easels next to each other, side-by-side --I've kept my end of the bargain! I've never told! Please! Just let me have this! Walter recoils, unable to take this. He relents.Oh... from the world around me. And I love Modigliani's use of line.Walter?What is going on here??!No you didn't.Did she just move in??How can you keep something so big a secret???I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.I painted it!Yes, we don't use my name, since people don't take women's art seriously.Luckily, my maiden name is Margaret Doris Hawkins! \"M\" is the 13th letter of the alphabet, \"D\" is 4, \"H\" 8! If you add up 1 and 3 in 13, that gives you 4, making 4 plus 4 plus 8 equals 16, then 1 plus 6 equals seven! The man's head is spinning. He's lost all interest. Across the room, Walter sees this debacle. He marches over.Rembrandt, shush! In the foyer, Margaret opens the front door. And standing there is Dee-Ann. Dazzled. She laughs with surprise.Yeah. That driveway is long. Honestly, I can't believe I live here. Dee-Ann glides in -- then freezes, agape.I know! Two acres, a pool, fiveWhat?I know. North Beach is 30 miles, but it might as well be 300...Oh, please! She's Walter's friend. He brings people by... the Beach Boys were here. But, it's pretty isolated. Dee-Ann goes silent. Margaret seems dwarfed by the house.Jane has nice friends. Sometimes I pick them up at the junior high, and we all get pizza.Good! I'll whip us up two gin fizzes. Margaret forces a smile and scurries behind a giant curved wet bar. She pulls out ingredients: Gin, lemon juice, soda...When we moved in, I thought a wet bar was extravagant... but it's surprising how much use you can get out of it. Dee-Ann watches the drinkmaking.He couldn't be happier. He has everything he ever dreamed of.No --! You can't go in --Dee-Ann, please! STOP -- Margaret rushes to block her -- but Dee-Ann pushes open the door, revealing...W-Walter paints in here too. Hmm. Dee-Ann walks about, examining the canvases. Then, her gaze settles on the Big Eye that Margaret was working on. Below the easel is the wet brush on the open jar of paint. Margaret sucks in her breath. Dee-Ann sees this.I won't.Okay, honey. I have to go work.Where did you appear from? Didn't you hear? No visitors! Rembrandt wags his tail, his little eyes bright. Margaret peers.Is this what it's come to? You're the only living soul I can tell my secret? Well -- I painted them all! It's TRUE! I did every single one -- She gestures, then catches sight of a Walter street scene.Well, every one except that street scene.No you don't! It's nice to have company, but that sofa is new. Let's find you some carpet to lay on.I think there's a scrap back here... She rummages, sliding the junk aside. In back is a TATTEREDWell what's this? Margaret swings the bulb closer. The crate is covered with SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS and international markings. Margaret's interest is piqued. She tugs at the lid, pulling it off. Revealing inside a STACK OF STREET SCENE PAINTINGS. Ten or fifteen of Walter's canvases. Or so it seems.Maybe you should give her one of your street scenes.No, Walter. She's a dignitary. Doesn't she deserve a piece that comes straight from you?Unless Madame Chiang Kai-shek already has a Cenic.Cenic is the name of the artist who did all your early paintings.The more you lie, the smaller you seem.Then why do you paint over the name? Walter gasps, floored. Margaret bores in.A bit of advice: Don't use a water- base over an oil. It flecks off. Walter cowers.No, I haven't.Walter? He turns. She winces, pained.Have you even been to Paris? Walter blanches. He shakes, broken up. He looks away, then staggers to a chair. He falls into it. Trembling. Not able to look her in the eye...I don't want you sleeping in this room any longer. I -- I can't keep living these lies.A new MDH. Something for me. It's about a woman trapped in an uncaring world. I call it, \"Escape.\" Walter bites his lip, afraid to talk.What?And then -- YOU'LL paint them?If you knew the basics, you wouldn't be at the easel. You have to sketch it first! Walter tightens, feeling stupid. He lets go of the canvas. Margaret stares, deciding. Then, she tosses him a PAD. Walter catches it. Slowly, he crosses over...I dunno. You tell me. You're the creator. He frowns.Oh, a Keane! How witty.How old is the subject?It matters! A young child's head is round. An older child's head is oval! He feels pressured. Hand shaking, he draws a crooked circle.NO I'M NOT! Every line is a decision!Walter!! Huh? He lurches, startled.I know the truth.NO! Absolutely NOT!! I still hate myself for giving you the Waifs!Oh, I'll talk as LOUD AS I WANT --What??!You're threatening me...?! Fine, kill me! My God, I've kept our secret for years! I've never once --What do you want, Walter? Everything with you is calculated. We're back where we had our first date... Walter's eyes widen. We MOVE IN TIGHT on them. He drops his voice. Dead serious.What masterpiece?You sound insane. Artists don't announce a masterpiece --He worked on that for FOUR YEARS!It's too big. Why'd you promise them Cinerama size?You're right! Where are your preliminary sketches?? All that time in art school, and somehow we waylaid your youthful experiments! The half- finished charcoals, the struggles...Get out of here. I'm trying to work. She brusquely spins away, back to the canvas. He shoots her an uncertain, dirty look. What just happened?W-what are you doing in here --?Jane, you don't know anything!! Jane's face tightens. Insulted.I was happier selling paintings in the park. He gapes, appalled.Friday, I file for divorce.How could anyone... say something so cruel?is mortified. This is all too awful. Silent, she watches Walter back out of the party...Walter! He throws ANOTHER MATCH.We're leaving. Determined, Margaret runs to the curtained wall. She whips it aside -- revealing the sliding glass doors.I'm sorry I wasn't the mother I could have been. I -- I should have done this years ago...Where we're going, we won't need much.Yes, Hawaii. Because it's paradise. There's flowers, and birds, and beautiful colors.Hello?It's a decree of legal separation. I would appreciate if you signed it.Walter, our marriage is over.Walter, I want a divorce.If that's the price.My God, Walter! How much more money do you need?Would you like to go into town? I'm stopping by the post office.Your friends are a bit... wild.Y-you know I can't have people over to the house.I'm not interested. She starts to close the door... but they continue.I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. The lady glances at Margaret's glass. She smiles gently.Sounds like my ex-husband. Margaret laughs. Surprised, the women laugh, too. Margaret peers at them. At their Bible.Would you like to come in?It's been so long since I've been happy. But, I don't even know why I'm telling you... two complete strangers.So you're -- Jehovah's Witnesses?I've explored so many religions. But they all had their flaws...And how do you know...?What does that mean, exactly?It says here a worshiper of Jehovah must be honest in all things. Jane snorts.I have nothing to hide!No... Big Lolo. Everything you just said is false. Margaret takes a deep breath. Working up her courage.One: Walter is no longer my husband. And Two: He's not... a painter. Margaret exhales. The D.J. is confused. He checks his notes.No. Though he's been taking credit for ten years.He made me sound crazy!!But how can I?! He claims I copied HIM! That he taught ME how to paint! \"She used a slide projector to trace my work and fill in the colors.\"I was forced into it. You had -- She stops, bothered by this awkwardness. She looks away from Walter, to the Jury instead.He had me dominated. He would rant and rave if I didn't do what he wanted. I was afraid. I didn't see any option, so I went along. I felt very bad...I just gave in. I allowed him to take credit for the big eyes. They reflected all my feelings... and... it was like losing a child...That's you, Walter. Jekyll and Hyde.No! You're outrageous! Constantly criticizing! Wearing me down! Saying I'd be \"knocked off\" if I ever told the truth!! The Jury GASPS. Walter throws out his hands.takes a pencil. She peeks over at Walter -- who's still glued to his seat. His face tight, his expression queasy. Staring off to some faraway place. Margaret looks up at the CLOCK. 3:20. Okay then. Totally calm, in a motion she's done so many times, she focuses on the canvas and starts outlining a Waif. Everybody watches. Effortlessly, she pencils the EYES. They are enormous. The largest orbs she has ever done.fills in more detail. Ears... nose... then, little fingers clutching a fence. The child is peeking over it, staring right at us...finishes penciling. She leans back, satisfied with the composition. Then, she reaches for... the PAINT. She unscrews a tube and squirts it on the palette. She rests it on her lap and starts mixing a flesh tone...peers at Walter, knowingly. She's not surprised. This was his only way out. A look between them -- and then she cocks a half-smile and turns back to the canvas. She squirts out some white oil paint, then begins painting the eyes.Thank you! Thank you so much.\"Exhibit 224.\" They all ROAR with laughter. A Reporter does a stand-up:Oh... it was never about the money. And honestly -- I doubt Walter will even pay.I just wanted credit for what I had done. The justice is...

I thought there were four.Crazy. A fake daughter... Dee-Ann's eyes take it all in. Astonished.It's been so long since I've seen you.You're probably busy, hanging out with your new rich buddies.I'm thirsty.How's Walter?And so do you! Fabulous. Dee-Ann smiles archly. She glances away -- and notices Margaret's STUDIO, the door half-open.Oh, is that your studio? Margaret turns -- and gasps.I just want a peek.

Est-ce que tout va bien?Je vais bien! I'm with a beautiful woman! Could life be any grander?? They get led in. Margaret is dazzled. Walter whispers.And I don't even have to pay! I'm set because I gave the chef a painting. You know what he said? \"Nobody paints Montmartre like Walter Keane!\"Best time of my life...Well you have to experience these things! Grab 'em!!Damn right! A wistful shrug. He chugs his glass.Of course, walkin' away from the bourgeois scene wasn't a snap. I had to quit my job. Leave my wife. These choices aren't easy... She stares at her wine.You shouldn't knock your work. I'd give an eyetooth to have your talent. Margaret is taken aback. He's absolutely sincere.You can look into someone and capture them on canvas! You paint people! I can only paint -- things. My street scenes are charming... but at the end of the day, it's just a collection of sidewalks and buildings. Walter goes silent. He has revealed his fears.Er, you can't rush inspiration --Don't worry. She's not bothering me...! Walter leaves Jane. He points at Margaret's canvas.There's something I gotta ask you. What's with the big crazy eyes...?Yeah, but, c'mon! You draw 'em like pancakes! I mean, they're WAY out of proportion! He's having fun, but she remains serious.Um... we should hear from Permits by Thursday.I'm in commercial real estate. A stunned beat.Of course!

In a debonair move, he creakily drops to his knee. He exudes a hammy, wonderful romance:Margaret, I'm on my knee! C'mon, whatdya say? Let's get married! We can be in Hawaii by the weekend.I knew you'd love it.Well, I don't know about forever. But maybe... I can arrange another week.Ruben, good day! Do you got a minute?You're gonna love my stuff today.Nah! That was painted in the Fifth Arrondissement. This is the Sixth Arrondissement!It's all up here. (beat; a sentimentalWould they want... this?No... they're my wife's. Fascinated, Ruben glances through Margaret's oils. Canvas after canvas of sad kiddies against gray, bleak backgrounds.So... what do you say? Ruben looks up, amazed. Walter seems oblivious.How dare you! Lots of people would like this.We'll never break in...! Because there's a CABAL. A secret society of gallery owners and critics, who get together for Sunday brunch in Sausalito, deciding what's \"cool.\"Heh! You're livin' in fairy land! People don't get to discover a thing. They buy art, because it's in the right place at the right time. O.s., MUSIC BUILDS. Muddled, Walter turns. He looks -- and then -- his eyes light up. He is getting an idea...Hey, Banducci. I love the music tonight. It's a gas.I'm Walter Keane. I'm a painter.No -- I'm an artist. I used to be based on the Left Bank. But now I've relocated to the \"States,\" and I'm looking for an... exhibition venue. Beat. Banducci frowns.Okay! I respect that. You're a businessman, not a charity! So how 'bout if I, uh... rented your walls? Hm?! Banducci raises an eyebrow.Yes! The paintings are available for public viewing daily, from 7 to 3! Er, no. 3 a.m. It's in a nightclub. Maggie! It's promotion time! We gotta lay the racket! Margaret puts on a smock, a bit dumbfounded. Walter spatters some paint on his shirt. He grins, then holds up his brush and SIGNS the painting: \"W. KEANE\" Margaret forces a \"cheese\" smile, with her Waif. FLASH! The camera pops.Ah, beautiful! An art lover! Yes sir, how may I help you?Yeah.Why, thank you...! Thank you so much!It's INSULTING! When people see art, they shouldn't think of SHIT!I'm -- I'm sorry. Banducci... laughed at our work. ...So I socked him.You're right! I know. But... I was already in a bad place. I'd had a couple... and earlier...It was a misunderstanding. And then, I didn't want to jinx the sale.Don't give me a hard time. I'm just grabbing my stuff... Across the packed room, he spots Banducci with a black eye. Walter halts, uncertain. A bristling tension... Until -- Banducci suddenly rushes and GRABS him! Walter flails, freaked. Banducci DRAGS him into a back kitchen --I'll see you in COURT, you son of a bitch! I'm suing you for assault! Slander! False arrest!! Banducci storms away. Walter shudders, \"upset.\" CUSTOMERS peer at him... then at the paintings. Curious, they migrate that way...I thought you only did celebrities.Huh? Uh, sure -- Dick smoothly drags him to the bar. Dick waves the bartender.Well, when I was in Paris...What do you wanna know...?!Ding-a-ling! Wake up, we're a HIT! Margaret rolls over, groggy. Walter jumps on the bed, grinning. He tosses her a HANDFUL OF MONEY.What a night! I sold out all your Big Eyes!! She rubs her eyes, amazed.They adore you! Cause of that article, the joint was PACKED. And then, a famous journalist showed up, and -- I need more paintings! Now! He hungrily KISSES her. She laughs.Of course! But, this is opportunity! Ah, we're gonna make a crackerjack team: Me schmoozing up the club, while you're back here, doing what you love! She stares at him -- then smiles. MUSIC......yeah, eyes are powerful. A poet said they're the windows of the soul. Margaret smiles, touched. She comes closer....You got it! That's why I paint 'em so big.If you like this style, I'm working on a few new pieces. I've got a little blonde girl in a blue dress that'll tear your heart out.Baby!I was... trying to close the deal --I'm just a salesman! You know, buyers pay more if they meet the painter --Shh, QUIET! He grabs her, pulling her behind a curtain. He's desperate.Don't blow this! Look, we're makin' money! Your pocket, my pocket? What's the difference?!Not all all! But it's not about ego! You wanna say you did the street scenes? Fine! I don't care! Say a monkey painted it! She breaks into tears, sobbing.Ah, honey! I just wanna share them with the world!Hey. Who is that remarkably handsome and confident man?I am! Walter swoops over and grabs Olivetti in a hearty clasp.It's a delight to meet you, Signore! Buon giorno! Have you been an art lover for long..? We move in tight on MARGARET, as the SOUND DIALS DOWN.We made five grand!! Five THOUSAND dollars...!!!No. No no! One of -- OUR good ones. Look at those zeroes! We've hit the big time! We are now hanging in the collection of Italian industrialist Dino Olivetti! With his patronage comes credibility! And with credibility comes RESPECT! Margaret stares at the check in her hands. At all the zeroes.Aw c'mon! The paintings say \"Keane\"! I'm Keane, you're Keane. From now on, we are one and the same. Walter pulls her tight. She doesn't resist.On behalf of the children of the world, we present this painting to Mayor Christopher!In the interest of peace through culture, we donate this painting to the people of Russia!Miss Crawford! In recognition of your cinematic craft, we bestow this painting, \"The Lion and the Child\"!Joan said \"Marvelous\"! MARVELOUS! That's worth more than 1000 critics! Hey, maybe she'll come to our opening.Says who?! Like John Q. Public cares? He's FED UP with abstract neoformalism! She responds -- but he sexily puts his finger to her mouth.He digs real art. Your art! It's beautiful. You're beautiful... Walter starts rubbing against her, dancing sensually. She laughs, embarrassed, her wet paint brushes smearing his chest. She relents and relaxes. They dance around...Ruben's gonna choke when he sees this! Little Jane tiredly glues another poster. She yawns.You have a good eye, sweetie. I painted it, but I was trying to mimic your mother's style. You know, the style she USED to paint in.Ah, my sweet! Are you enjoying the scene?Give a hand to my beautiful wife. Without her, none of tonight would be possible! The crowd APPLAUDS politely, condescendingly. Margaret smiles strangely. The Tipsy Man leans in.That? Oh, wow. Probably... months. First the thinking, the sketching, and then time with just me and the oils.Oh --! You mean that painting! Uhh, sorry! It's like a jumble of ideas, rattling around in my brain! Beat.What do you mean?Well, er, I've just always loved kids. Though mostly I was influenced by my darling daughter... An odd beat.I remember when she was a baby... Walter gets a far-off look.Yeah. Cute little thing. I'd stare into those big orbs. Sometimes I'd get out my Brownie and snap a photo... but... that's not subjective. You know? It doesn't capture your feelings. So that's when I started painting her... We hold on Walter, unsure where reality begins and ends...Janie, sweetie, you need to respect your mother's privacy. Sometimes grownups need alone time.Whew! Out of this world...!Ah, Jane's grand! She's eating ice cream! She has new shoes. She has a college fund. Beat.Well I don't want you feeling like a prisoner. Take a break! Walter glances at one PAINTING -- then does a take.Is that a tear...? You've gone deep! Margaret bites her fingers, worried.I love it! ...How'd you get the eyes so lifelike? Is it the highlights?I owe you an apology. I was initially dismissive of your kids, those emotion- wrenching blobs of humanity... but they have a real strength.I'm trying! Ah, you know me. See -- this is why I need your help! I want to go on tv, to defend our art.Yes! But... what will I say??Cute.Funny! Keep 'em coming! You're a regular Steve Allen. You want heat this winter? Help me out!What would make a grown man paint a picture like this?! No answer. He thinks of stories, wheels spinning.I grew up, surrounded by six sisters.Well, because... I lived it! I experienced it!Well -- NO! Of course not. It was after the War. There was destruction everywhere...I traveled the Continent. The ravages were horrifying...My psyche was scarred in my art student days. Nothing in my life has ever made such an impact as the sight of the children: War-wracked innocents, without homes, without parents, fighting over garbage... He sits in a half-circle of PROPER WOMEN, who are spellbound.Goaded by a frantic despair, I sketched these dirty, ragged little victims... with their bruised minds and bodies, their matted hair and runny noses. There my life as a painter began in earnest. Walter sadly looks up to the HOST. The man is shellshocked. Mute. Walter waits, then sighs.The insane, inhuman cruelty inflicted upon these children cut deeply into my being. From that moment on, I painted the lost children with the eyes. Those eyes that forever retained their haunting quality. The ladies are stricken. A few dab their eyes.Good afternoon! Delighted! How many sales today?It's the craziest thing. I started charging for the posters! First a nickel... then a dime. YES, Maggie! It's cuckoo! So it got me thinkin': Would you rather sell a $500 painting, or a million cheaply- reproduced posters?!Whew! Something smells in here. You should open a window. Margaret blinks, a bit dazed.I dunno. 6:30, 7? ...Didn't Janie get dinner? Margaret shrugs. Walter leans in.When's the last time you washed your hair?What do you got back there? Lemme see.\"The world\"? Baby, it's me! (stepping forward, a bitIt's a completely different style.How am I gonna explain that? She shifts about.That seems a bit confusing. \"Keane\" means me.Who'd you tell about the Big Eyes?You tell anybody, the empire COLLAPSES! Do you wanna give back the money? We've committed FRAUD!Janie thinks I'm in here, painting.That was the honeymoon period! Margaret breaks into tears. Walter tenses.Jesus, you're so fragile.Yep! Walter and his girls! With galleries in three cities!Yeah, we don't talk about it. Sadly, people don't buy lady art.The bar's over there. Dick goes to get a refill. Walter shoots Margaret a look.Yeah, Margaret's a superb artist, in her own way. I even steal a few tips from her, now and then!Oh, for Christ's sake, Margaret! Dick writes a gossip column --What a talent! Look at these Keanes! If you cut open our veins, we bleed oil! Er -- turpentine.Ah! A little treat! The fourth member of the Painting Keanes! Margaret and Jane turn, confused. Walter whips openLily, honey, how are you?! He gives her a giant hug. She responds stiffly -- a girl who doesn't see her father too often.Really? Did you get in a fight?Well is the tooth fairy somethin' I gotta deal with, or did your mother already handle it?Good! Good good! Well, just go throw your stuff in the kids' room, then you can come join the fun! Lily toddles out.Didn't I? Sure. Lil's from my first marriage. Margaret struggles to hold her rage. Disoriented...That's Lily. I'm sure I mentioned her --No! Her mom's just going to Vegas for the weekend.She's a sweet girl.I put up with your daughter. I never said a peep. Margaret's jaw drops.I'm sorry. Sorry! Please... let's just try to get through this.Yeah, Walter Keane and Gauguin have a lot in common. They both walked away from successful careers to travel the globe, live on a boat... We move... finding Margaret alone in a small ANNEX. It displays a few of her sad blondes, alongside Jane and Lily's paintings of flowers and Mr. Potato-Head. Margaret sits, seeming like an adult at the children's table. An urbane RICH MAN glides by... and is taken with one of Margaret's nubile blondes. He gazes at the lounging figure. Margaret sits up. Alert, pleased with his interest. She tingles. Then, happily excited, unable to hold it in:Psst! Maggie! Can I have a second? Good grief! What the hell are you babbling about?! Long division?? Could you please help the world and shut your mouth? You want just one number in his head: The sales price! Her face drops, hurt. Acquiescing.What the hell's going on here?!!You KNOW I don't like anyone seeing my work before it's done! Walter rushes to the Waif, then for show grabs up the wet brush and quickly starts to \"finish\" the painting. Suddenly -- an odd expression crosses his face. He eyeballs the canvas, realizing he doesn't know what to do. A furtive glance. Then, unbowed, he hastily dips the brush and slaps a little black onto the shaded background. Walter spins, victorious.There!You and your whole non-representational crowd are FRAUDS!!Get outta my house! My big house!I don't want her ever invited here again. Margaret nods, terribly sad.M-Maggie! What're you doin' up? Margaret glares. Not speaking. He shrugs.I had a helluva night. Worked three or four clubs. Stumbled onto some hot gossip: Madame Chiang Kai-shek is coming to town! Straight from Taipei! I think we should present her with a painting -- get Dick to flack it...Yeah? Maybe you're right. She probably doesn't have a Parisian street scene hanging in her palace. Margaret nods, as if they've settled something. She turns to walk away -- then suddenly SPINS.\"Cenic\"...? Uh, what's that? Margaret stares, eyes sharp.Huhhh? Urgh... oh! CENIC! Cenic was my nickname in Paris! All my art school pals loved my scenic views, so they called me \"Scenic\"! But since those Frogs can't pronounce a hard \"e,\" I became \"Cenic.\" He looks up at her hopefully. But she shakes her head.How DARE you accuse me of lying! I'm proud of my early Cenics!You sound crazy! For God's sake. You've... you've SEEN me paint!!!!I studied art in Paris. I went to school at the Beaux-Arts. The Grand Chaumiere. I spent hours in the Louvre, gazing at the greatness of the Masters...I wanted... I so wanted to be an artist. But -- it just never turned out good. Margaret stares, seething. Then, without comment, she storms away. She SLAMS the door shut. BANG! Walter doesn't move.What are you working on?I figured out a solution to our problems.Teach me.Sure! Why not?Y-you're right!So...? What's first?It's a -- Keane.YEAH YEAH! Point taken. I'm standing here naked and humiliated in front of you. Look... can we just do a crying child? She gazes at him. Fingering her pencil... Trying to jump-start things, he starts to draw a circle --Huh? C'mon, it's a head --The child is this old!How's SALES?How many posters are back here?Does the printer owe us more? Do we owe him??What about the OILS?! Are there more at the warehouse?For the LOVE OF MUD! What am I PAYING you for? The girl freezes, rattled. Walter spins, flipping out.Hypothetical question: If you were a man, would you marry Kim Novak or my wife? What?Okay! Different question! If I got crippled and had to stop painting, how long before the gallery ran out of inventory and went belly up??What's it all mean? Why are we put on this earth? A 100 years from now, will people even know we existed...?It's not even mine! It's one of hers. Aching, he staggers off. Sweating, woozy, he sits at a table. Distracted, he glances down at a newspaper...This doesn't change anything.Who cares?! This is all your fault! Maybe it's time to shake things up. Start puttin' my name on the MDH's. Margaret is astonished. A fury crosses her face.Quiet! Lower your voice --NO YOU WON'T! Or --If you tell ANYONE, if you squeal, I'll take you out! I -- I know people. Remember Banducci's cousin? The liquor wholesaler? Pause. Margaret breaks into tears.Christ, wipe your face! You look a mess.Look, I don't deny I need you. You're the one with the gift.Exactly! What have I been missing all this time?! Da Vinci has his Mona Lisa... Renoir has his Boatmen's Lunch... but where's my defining statement?Why not?! Didn't Michelangelo know he was hittin' a homer, when he was on his back painting the Sistine Chapel?Posterity, baby...!! She empties her drink.And here's the best part. It's for Unicef! Unicef is sponsoring the Hall of Education. Aw, we can finally give back to the children of the world!! Margaret stares, wavering...Because it has to encompass all children. All races! One hundred stricken faces! Marching to infinity! The ultimate Walter Keane!Oh, a publisher says it's good timing to put out a coffee table book. You know, classy: \"Tomorrow's Masters.\"I know you're being sarcastic, but these are all good ideas. Berlin war orphans... early self-portraits...Stop. Let us appreciate this moment. This is what we've worked toward our whole lives: Rarified air. Inside this house are the movers and shakers. Kennedys. Rockefellers.You are one crazy bitch. Walter spins and grandly enters. He grabs two CHAMPAGNES from a server.So maybe you have problems with the choices we made... but -- c'mon! Wednesday, the World's Fair opens. Thursday, our book goes on sale!Aw, why are you always so miserable?Mrs. Teasdale! Walter Keane. I just want to thank you for hosting this absolutely enchanting soiree. Walter takes the woman's hand. She smiles stiffly, silently horrified. She glances around for help. She catches a SOCIETY MAN's eye, and he hurries over.Er, no. Honestly, I've been so busy all day preparing for this lovely --What do YOU care?! That's MY name being dragged through the mud! Walter CRUSHES the newspaper. He spins on the guy.Is he here?What are you afraid of??Why does a man become a critic --?? Because he can't create! You don't --Don't interrupt! You don't know what it's like! To put your emotions out there, naked, for the world to see.looks around -- then quivers, realizing he's out of control. Shamed, he slowly drops the fork. People breathe a sigh of relief.What's wrong with lowest common denominators?! That's what this country was built on!! He KNOCKS over a lamp. Crash!I'm gonna sue EVERYBODY! I'll sue that pansy critic! And the World's Fair! And -- Unicef!But I can't sue you, can I? You were the ultimate betrayal! You FAILED me with that painting! Suddenly, he pulls out a BOOK OF MATCHES. He lights a MATCH and waves it sinisterly --You crossed over from sentimentality to KITSCH! He THROWS the match at them.You like making me look bad?? You enjoy people laughing at me??! He PUNCHES the wall, then tosses the match. Fwoosh!Lemme in, you BITCHES!!Ow!You got all that paint and turpentine in there? Well I'm gonna burn you up! He pushes the lit match through the KEYHOLE.You're gonna blow like an atom bomb!Maggie --? She freezes.Boy, you were sure hard to track down. Thought I might never find you... I'm a little agitated. I got the strangest papers in the mail today. Margaret tries to stay cool.Aren't you acting too rash?Granted, our romance may have seen its better days. The bloom is off the rose.Whew. It hurts to hear you say those words. Silence. He is feigning \"hurt feelings.\" Struggling for a response. Finally, his thoughts sharpen up, smart and shrewd.I sure hate that it's come to this.Really?!Uh -- okay. And... then, we have to consider future revenue stream.It's -- the marketplace! I gotta stay fresh. Surely you understand?Nah, Warhol's like me. That fruitfly stole my act! \"The Factory\"? I had a factory before he had a soup can! The girls scrunch their faces, lost. Then -- DING-DONG! Walter peeks out the window, then grins.Ah! It's my art supplies.Holy mother of GOD! Walter JERKS UP -- feral -- like an animal sensing danger. He whirls and looks around. Paranoia ratcheting. Is everybody staring at him? Walter starts shaking in horror. Then -- he jumps and BOLTS OUT.Margaret's gone berserk! You gotta help me! I need a story, a wire story -- national! -- to calm things down. Dick peers shrewdly.But it's nuts! It doesn't even make sense. When I was studying art at the Beaux Arts in Paris, she was still a kid in Tennessee! Dick reacts. Walter whips out the \"Tomorrow's Master's\" BOOK.Look! These are my early sketches. (he flips pages, like aExactly! It's impossible! We didn't meet for another nine years! After she busted her first marriage.She's unhinged! She left me and moved into the jungle. She fell in with a bunch of religious zealots:Oh! These people are gone! Solid gone! They don't celebrate Christmas, they can't salute the flag... they won't even let Janie go to the prom! Dick is startled.I'm angry as hell! But I'm lucky to have the mighty Gannett News Company watching my back. I expect to have this whole trial dismissed by noon.\"Good luck\"? W-where the hell are you going?!I've always taken care of myself, Your Honor. And I don't need a bunch of rent-a-suits to defend my good name!I'm the sole creator of my art. This is my total life. My contribution to the world --Oh. Right! Ah, sorry, Your Honor.Mrs. Keane. It seems impossible that you'd expect anybody to swallow your fantastic story --Mrs. Keane. You seem like a lucid woman. Reasonably intelligent... So how could you possibly have gone along with such a far-out scheme?I want to remind you you are under oath. The Judge SLAMS his fists down, enraged. Walter jumps.S-sorry. Margaret turns back to the Jury.Hm! It sounds like you've described two different men. One a sadistic ogre... and the other a delightful bon vivant. Margaret stares him in the eyes.What an outrageous statement! I demand we strike that from the record!Your HONOR! I ask for a mistrial! Both Keanes starts QUARRELING. The Judge STANDS.I'm sorry for the emotions. I'm an artist. The Judge stares harshly.I call as my witness... Mr. Walter Stanley Keane! A strange beat. The Jurors glance at each other. Walter reacts, like he just heard his name. He strides jauntily over to the witness stand. The BAILIFF gives the Judge a weird look. Then, he pulls out a Bible. Walter slaps down his hand.Mr. Keane. There has been a lot of innuendo and contradictory testimony about the genesis of the \"big-eyed waifs.\" Would you mind clarifying to this court, once and for all, who spawned these paintings? Walter sprints back into the witness stand. He sits, then reacts coyly, as if he's surprised.Why -- I created the children. Walter starts to stand again -- but the Judge SLAMS his bench.I've had a wonderful life. I've been an artist, a world traveler, a friend of untold celebrities... But when I look back at it all, when I peer into my heart and define what mattered...it is that I was dedicated to the hungry children of the world....the orphans were clutching the barbed wire. Their bodies lacerated, their fingers scrawny, their eyes big and helpless. Imploring me, begging me... \"Do something!\"...and then Miss Joan Crawford walked up to me......Kim Novak......Liberace......Wayne Newton...Miss Natalie Wood walked up and said, \"That is the greatest single painting I have ever seen in my entire life.\" The Judge is bored out of his mind.I was born in a small town. My father made upholstery for the automobileB-but, I'm not finished --looks ill. Wracked with uncertainty. The Judge turns to him.is melting down. In total crisis...feels all eyes on him. He has to do something. Hesitantly, visibly shaking, he rises from the table. Margaret notices this.No -- it's --I -- I don't think I'll be able to paint today.sinks down in his chair, beaten. All life gone. He stares at the emerging canvas, eyes wide, and we PUSH INTO WALTER'S FACE. He is witnessing the end of his empire... the destruction of everything that makes him who he is. We push in TIGHTER... TIGHTER... until the screen fills with his two eyes.What a group of idiots... a quagmire of incompetence...", "clean_line": "wanna touch lay gonna break excuse ladies better spare change shouldn sell

back do these go?This is a very strange case. These paintings hang in museums all over the world, attributed to Mr. Keane. And regardless of the truth, Mrs. Keane has contributed immeasurably to the confusion... The Judge stares off... then makes a decision.It seems impossible that Gannett's actions would ever meet the legal standard for libel. So -- the charge against them is dismissed.Mr. Keane, you appear to be without counsel. Would you like a postponement, in order to get your affairs in order? Walter glances over at Margaret. She stifles a laugh. He glares daggers. Then, cocksure, foolhardy, he jumps to his feet.Mr. KEANE! I've told you, you must ask the witness questions! If you're acting as your own attorney, you cannot make statements at this time.Overruled!!HEY! This is not a domestic squabble! Or -- maybe it is. But the rest of us have no interest in watching you two go at it. Walter calms himself, contrite.Maybe.The choreography is not necessary. Just sit down and testify. Oh. Walter sits, then gathers his thoughts... We slowly PUSH IN. He smiles, wistfully...You're done. Walter stops, surprised.Actually, you are! I cannot stomach one more wild tangent or shaggy dog tale. You're not testifying -- you're filibustering! The Federal Courts are overburdened enough, without your docket-clogging nonsense.NO! It's not a mistrial!! In my opinion, there's only one way to clear up this thicket. You are both going to paint. Walter gasps, stunned. All color drains from his face.Now, I'm not looking for a masterpiece. I don't know much about these things -- I'm a jurist, not an art critic -- but, is one hour enough? Margaret nods: Sure. Shaking, Walter barely moves his head.Okay then. You've both been provided with identical supplies... so -- without any further business... Mrs. Keane, Mr. Keane, the court is yours.Mr. Keane?Mr. Keane!
