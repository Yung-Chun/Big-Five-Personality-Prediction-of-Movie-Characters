{"Box-The": {"NORMA": {"raw_line": "Did you hear something?Are you sure that was the doorbell? From down below... the DOORBELL rings again.Quarter 'til five. Norma gets out of bed and throws on her bathrobe. Arthur sits up, hair sticking up in every direction. He has sideburns that run down the side of his face like daggers.Someone left a box.I don't know. There was a car waiting... but they drove off. Norma hands the box to Arthur. He examines it.Is there a note? Arthur reaches inside the box and retrieves a small WHITE ENVELOPE. Printed on the envelope in CALLIGRAPHY is the name:Mr. Steward will call upon you at 5I couldn't see. It was dark and 1 didn't have my contacts in.I don't know. But the bus will be here if five minutes... so eat.Put on your hat... A young girl, DANA is waiting at the end of the sidewalk. She is wrapped head-to-toe in warm clothes... EARMUFFS and SCARF around her neck.Good morning, Dana.I'm thirty-one!Well you'll be a geezer one day too, smarty-pants.My love embarrasses you?What if I give little Walter a little kiss in front of all his friends on the school bus? Dana's eyes widen. A MISCHIEVOUS GRIN emerges from behind the scarf that covers the lower part of her face.Dana... you're baby-sitting for us tonight, right?Eight o'clock.Bus-Driver Bud! Merry Christmas...Rex Morgan... I need you back here no later than seven. Rehearsal dinner starts at eight. Arthur grabs his BRIEFCASE and a BASKETBALL.Don't get stuck in Friday traffic...Not in the house!It's fine. She pushes him toward into the FAMILY ROOM... opening the door that leads out to the garage. They exit the house and the CAMERA drifts back toward the kitchen table... moving in toward the box.From you?Don't be late tonight.So what does that mean for me?Starting when?Okay.Yeah, me too. I've got three weeks to figure out how to tell my son we can't afford to send him to Collegiate any more. The drop of blood has begun to flow down onto his upper lip.Yeah... your nose is bleeding. Poates reaches for his HANDKERCHIEF and puts it to his face, wiping off the blood. The MORNING BELL rings.Okay... everyone quiet down! Take your seats! Norma moves toward a stack of METAL TRAYS on her desk. Inside of each tray is a BALL OF BLACK MUSH.Today is the day many of you have been eagerly awaiting. You get to dissect owl pellets. A MALE STUDENT pumps his fist...Hey... watch the language. You say another cuss word I've gotta send you to detention, okay?Is what true?Yes... this is true. The classroom gasps in disgust... others laugh.Grey forest owls feed upon field mice, squirrels and small birds. The owl will then regurgitate the bones and waste matter in a ball of black mucous. Inside this mucous you will likely find the entire skeleton of its prey. Norma goes to the front of the room and lowers a SCREEN.I'm going to show you a film about the digestive process of the owl, and how the owl pellet is formed. The classroom whispers with excitement.Hmmm?What happened... to my foot?Well... it's a long story. She looks at her watch.We've got five minutes until second period. She looks back at her class and sees that their curiosity has been piqued. She has no choice now but to tell them.Alright... I'll tell you what happened to my foot.And so I go to see the doctor. He goes to take an X-ray of my foot to see if the bones are broken.They found out that the tissue in four of my toes had been completelySo they have to amputate four of my toes. And then they had to take a bunch of skin from my inner thigh to cover the front of my foot. This is back in 1963... so they didn't have the skin graft techniques they do now.You guys want to see it? Now that the secret is out... I don't want you spreading rumors about my mangled foot. The class responds enthusiastically.Come on... gather round... take a look at the freak show. As the kids gather around... Norma removes her right shoe and reveals her disfigured foot... missing every toe but her pinky. A rounded piece of SCAR TISSUE covers the rest of it.Hey honey.Because you're nine years old. You're not a geezer yet.We're not buying you a moped, Walter. Stick with the bike... and be home before dark.Hello? There is silence on the other end of the line.Hello? A MOMENT OF SILENCE... then the caller disconnects. Norma hangs up the phone and starts unloading the groceries. The box sits on the table... but she takes no notice of it.Yeah.Oh, yes. Yes we did.The button unit. That's what you call it?Sure. Norma turns and leads him back into the kitchen. She retrieves the button unit from the table.So what it this thing? I assume you're trying to sell me something?Yeah? What are you selling?Are you for real? Arlington smiles back at her.Who do you work for?Wait a minute... you're just going to leave me with this thing.Hey mom.Nothing... I just... The CAMERA continues to zoom out, revealing her husband, JIM BURNS laid out in a recliner, watching television.No... something just happened and...Nothing. I don't want to talk about it right now.Hmmm. I think they're spending more on their wedding than we did on our house.A little, yeah. That damn bone. The skin from my leg, it's not as tough as it should be.Who?Well... it's been what... thirteen years? Bound to run into each other at some point, right?What's this?Oh my god!Oh my God, Rex... how'd you do it?I don't know what I'd do without you.Yeah... I'll tell you about it in the car. We're running late. Norma leans down and kisses Walter on the cheek.We'll be home late... your bedtime is ten. Dana watches them go... her eyes transfixed on the box in Norma's hands.And before I could ask him anything else... he got in his car... and he pulled off.No.I was little overwhelmed, Arthur.Those were his exact words.No.Yeah. He said it was two-hundred thousand. It looked real to me.You don't want to know. I think he's a burn victim. Poor thing... half of his face is gone.I think maybe he's a life insurance salesman. Maybe that's what it is. It's some kind of survey. We push the button and he offers us a discount on a two-hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. Joke's on us.What the hell are you doing?!No!I don't know. He was... he seemed very sure of himself. If it's some kind of survey... then... he's a really good salesman because I believe him. I believe that he might give us that money.I don't know. Arthur takes the box back from her. He shakes it... then flips it over. He sees that there is a SINGLE SCREW on the bottom corner that holds it together.What are you doing? Arthur is now unscrewing the bottom of the box.Why do you get to hold it?Neither can you.Fine. Norma goes through her purse and hands the small envelope to him. They move toward the entrance to the country club.Jesus. All this for a rehearsal dinner... Deborah is so lucky. Remember our rehearsal dinner?Uh-huh.Arthur has been working at Nasa.Arthur made me a new prosthesis for my foot. Some space age formula... it's incredible.You gotta let it go. You gotta learn to forgive and forget.That's right. He shakes her hand... fascinated by her.That's right. There he is right over there. She points over to Arthur the bar. Powell looks over at him... and they briefly make eye contact.Two-hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money, Arthur.We could get out of Richmond... move to California.You can't arrest someone for pushing a button, Arthur. It's not a weapon. It's not a gun. We wouldn't be culpable... not in a court of law.What if it's some murderer on death row in China?Yeah. Doug and Donna.I know you better than you know yourself.Even better than I know you. They spin around on the dance floor.Life insurance. Arthur gazes across the ballroom toward the bar. Nathan sits there alone... finishing his drink.Dana... Dana's eyes slowly open.Arthur will drive you home, okay?Where's Walter?Can you turn off the Christmas tree lights?It's a fire hazard.We could die.Fine. Leave them on. She goes upstairs... leaving him alone with the glowing tree. Arthur looks down at the coffee table. The box sits there... taunting him. He retrieves the KEY ENVELOPE from his pocket and stares at it. He then walks over to the wall and unplugs the Christmas tree lights.We'll never see that much money.Be realistic Arthur... you work for the government.We'll never leave Richmond.We have to put Walter in public school.Collegiate withdrew the faculty tuition discount.Yeah. They did.We'd have to enroll him at Hopewell. Unless...Yeah. Norma begins to dial the number on the card.Is this Mr. Steward?How did you know it was me... are you tracing this call?If we push the button... are you going to murder someone?How will they die?Are you selling life insurance?Why do you do this? What do you get out of this deal?Can we meet in person? I'd like to see you... before we make our final decision.Excuse me?Hello? There is no response.Mr. Steward? Are you still there? Norma hangs up the phone. She stares at the box... then at her husband, as he sits down across from her.We're gonna have to pull Walter out of that school.I'm scared to.Ladies first. She then reaches out and presses down on the button with her index finger.Hi.Uhh... yeah... it's in the kitchen. Norma goes to the kitchen to retrieve the box, leaving Arthur alone with Arlington.Oh... sorry... Norma reaches into her pocket and retrieves the small envelope and places it in his hand.You said before that the box is re- programmed...So now what? Are you gonna go and make the offer to someone else?I don't know. Arthur paces around... thinking. He then opens the briefcase and starts counting through the money.I don't know.Hey dad...I need a favor.I need you to run a license plate for me. Someone just came by the house... and we think he might... He just seemed real suspicious and Arthur got the license plate and I need you to run it.No... if you could just run the plate and find out whose car it is.Hello?Yeah. Norma begins to write them down.Hi... I'm trying to reach an Arlington Steward.Yes.Yes.Arthur...This isn't real. This isn't happening.We're off to run an errand. Be back in a few hours, okay?There was owl... in our back yard.He said it was his owl.No exit.it's pronounced Sartre. Jean-Paul Sartre. The French existentialist. She begins to thumb through the pages of the play.It's a play... I read it in high school. It's about three strangers who find themselves trapped in a room together for all of eternity. They've quickly discover that they've all been sent to hell. Norma turns back to the inside cover of the book. Someone has written in crisp penmanship:Hi... we're looking for an archival Times-Dispatch from September of this year. She offers them a warm smile.I feel like I'm gonna faint... She stands up to leave.Bathroom. Norma moves.taward the main library... leaving Arthur alone.About five seconds after I laid eyes on him.In college. My sophomore year. He was a year younger than me. We dated for two weeks and then... She stops herself.Then I thought... this is too good to be true. When he sees my mangled foot... he's gonna be out the door in ten seconds and he's gonna go tell all his friends.We were at the drive-in... and he caught a glimpse of the scars on my thigh. He asked me what happened... and I felt this sense of dread.Because you can just see the glow disappear in someone's eyes when they discover something about you that they just can't stomach.No. Not Arthur. He was different than the others. He... said that... my scars were cool.I felt.. . She stops herself... afraid of how he might respond if she is honest with him.I felt...Love.Yes.Because of my foot. Because of my disfigurement. I thought of all the pain I've felt in my life because of it... the physical pain... the emotional pain.I thought about what it would be like to have that pain magnified and projected onto my face... onto a part of my body that I can't hide with a shoe. There are tears welling in her eyes.I saw all of that pain in your face and I understood it... and I felt an overwhelming feeling of love for you because I knew I'd never feel sorry for myself or my goddamn foot ever again.I don't know. Norma notices Walter standing in the doorway.We did? She sits up in bed... looking at the clock radio. It is 6PM.The wedding. It starts in an hour. We've got to get ready.They didn't have lids...I had the same dream. Arthur's mind is racing... he glances through the crowd nervously, afraid that they are being watched.The library. He was asking me all of these questions... about you... about our marriage.There are no mirrors... so they will never be able to see their own reflection... but only the faces of their tormentors.Because Hell... is other people. The look into one another's eyes... Norma sees a WAITER pass by with a tray of CHAMPAGNE. They both take a glass. Jim crosses the lawn to greet them.My little sister once asked me... what's the best thing about being married? Norma looks across the lawn to the table where Arthur is seated, next to Walter and their parents.I told her that... it's knowing that for the rest of your life you'll never feel alone.That is... until you get divorced. There is laughter from the crowd. Deborah blushes... leaning her head on her new husband's shoulder.Or... until he decides to kill you. More laughter.Say what?I don't know... I thought it was funny. Guess I've had too much champagne.No.No. Norma is still searching for some other explanation.What if it's all a test for the aspiring astronauts?A psychological test. They want to see how you'll respond to a moral dilemma... the fate of a human life... determined by the push of a single button. Think of the men on the Apollo thirteen mission... sound familiar? They turn slowly on the dance floor... Arthur closes his eyes... his mind racing... A VOICE breaks through the music...It's okay Arthur... Arthur looks at him... then back at Norma. His face has gone pale and he looks for a moment as though he might faint on the dance floor.I'm sorry for that. I can't control what people say.Yes. You have my forgiveness, Earl. People make mistakes... and if they seek forgiveness... they should be forgiven.Walter?Walter? A BLACK SEDAN pulls up next to her... and Reston steps out of the car. Norma locks eyes with him... recognizing his face...Yes.Yeah? Where is my son? Where is my husband?Arthur!Where's Walter?What does it want? Cahill glances at Teague... who looks to Cahill.What did he say to you when you were in the car with him?What have you done with our son?That's not fair.If Arthur has to do it... then I want you to make it look like a suicide. Arthur shouldn't be punished for something that I did.This isn't happening... She starts the engine... and they drive off. Arthur watches the parking lot full of MEN reflected back at them in the side-view mirror.All these years... I've given you the impression that Walter was an accident.And... it wasn't exactly an accident.Because I was so afraid of losing you to someone prettier than me. Arthur just stares at her... unsure how to respond.For that alone... I deserve a bullet in the heart... don't you think?No.Where is our son?Walter! Norma reaches down and takes her son's hand.Walter! It's mom! Can you hear me?!He could get hurt...Come downstairs, Arthur. She takes his left hand... as he clutches Walter's hand in his right.Arthur...Arthur... I love you, and I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry that I did this to us...I'll be waiting... counting the days until my Arthur comes to see me.It's going to be harder for you to live than for me to die. Arthur closes his eyes... the noise is excruciating.

Norma retrieves her WATCH from the bedside table.What time is it?What is it?Who?Maybe... it's up to you. Arthur opens the lid and sees that there are FOAM PEANUTS inside. He digs down and retrieves a WOODEN BOX. Its dimensions are 8\" x 8\" x 8\".It's for you, Norma. Norma opens the envelope and removes a folded piece of white stationary. Printed in elegant calligraphy is a single sentence:I dunno. You tell us.What kind of car was it?Do you realize that this is the first time in my life that I will be taking more than a week's vacation, June? Norma arrives in the kitchen. She now has a slight limp.And enjoy it! Don't worry about the office!The Viking Squad has a game at four.Okay June. He starts bouncing the ball on the kitchen floor. She grabs the ball in mid bounce... annoyed with him.How's your foot?It's your Christmas present.From your secret lover.I've got your present at work. It's almost finished. He smiles... then peels off down Monument Ave. From Norma's REAR VIEW MIRROR... Arthur's car disappears down the road. She reaches up to re-adjust... her eyes appear in the mirror's reflection. INSERT: Norma's VIRGINIA license plate. The Oldsmobile drives down the street in the opposite direction.It all comes down to water. Arthur points to an OVERHEAD SATELLITE PHOTO of Utopia Planitia, a raised level of martian terrain in the vicinity of the site where VIKING II landed. There are dry river-bed formations in the soil.If we find water beneath the surface... and the topographic maps of Utopia Planitia indicate that there were once rivers on the surface of the planet, it's possible that we'll eventually find evidence of life.I see.Are they really with-holding some of the Mars photos?It's a salinic compound.Christmas present for Norma. Arthur retrieves a WHITE CERAMIC MOLD. The mold has an extrusion that is shaped like a WOMAN'S FOOT... only the end of the foot is round and missing its toes, save for the PINKYYep. Arthur carefully impresses the MOLD of his wife's foot into the pink goop... sealing the mold at the edges into the tray.The compound they're developing for the pilot chairs on the space shuttle.When she was seventeen... still living in Texas, her brother dropped a barbell on her foot... broke three of her toes.So this dumb-ass Richmond doctor takes the x-ray... then he goes to check on another patient down the hall. Arthur discards a king.This dumb--ass... he left the x-ray machine on.She had to sit there in a hospital bed in the same position for six months, waiting for it to heal. Wendell stares at the mold on the laboratory table.Oh yeah. Her family sued. They won.Forty thousand dollars. Arthur pulls the ceramic mold out of the pink goop... and we see the IMPRESSION of her disfigured foot inside the newIf this sucker works... she can, start jogging again.Not too bad. Maybe an hour and twenty minutes.A little gift from Dr. Rex Morgan. She opens the present and retrieves the PROSTHESIS.It's a material they developed for the new shuttle chairs. It'll absorb the pressure of your foot and re-distribute it across the entire surface area. She then slides her disfigured foot into the shoe... and begins to walk around the room.I just figured out a way to make it better. She crosses the room and gives him a hug and a kiss.Merry Christmas, June.Yeah... what's it all about. Did he show up?Did you get the license plate?Your dad is cop, Norma. Always get the license plate number.Somewhere in the world... someone you do not know will die.Did he say how they would die?And he showed you the cash.What did he look like?Really?Did you bring the key with you? She hands it to him. He takes the key and inserts it... opening the glass dome. He then takes his INDEX FINGER and places it on the button.You think it's for real. She takes the box back from him.Do then you think he's a maniac and he might go kill someone?Open the glove compartment. There's a philips head screwdriver in there. She opens the GLOVE COMPARTMENT and retrieves a PHILLIPS HEAD SCREWDRIVER for him.I'm gonna see what's inside of it. He removes the screw... and sees that the wooden base rotates on a ROD MOUNT on the opposite corner. INSIDE... it is completely empty.Nothing... no transmitter... no radio. If we pushed the button right now... he'd have no way of knowing. She takes the box from him and closes the dome.Let me hold the key.Because you'll lose it Norma. You can't hold your liquor.What if someone takes your purse? I have pockets. Let me hold it.Yeah. Keg party in our back yard. Susan and Jim are standing with ARTHUR LEWIS, SR and BEV LEWIS . Arthur and Norma go over to greet them. The CAMERA drifts over to a PLACARD that reads:Never.Nathan! Arthur stands up and gives him a hug.It's been years. How have you been?Nathan and I are gonna go grab a drink... He begins to wheel Nathan toward the bar.What'd you ever do to Norma?You can't think of it that way.You didn't leave the x-ray machine on, Dr. Stupid did.You're no more culpable than the company that manufactured the barbell. Stop punishing yourself. Nathan smiles in appreciation and takes a long swig of Jack Daniels.Who?What would we do with that kind of money?Then we could cross the border into Mexico if they ever came after us.What if it's someone's baby?What if it's our neighbor across the street. Do you know our neighbors across the street? Have you ever met them?Hmmm. I haven't met Doug or Donna.Do you know Walter?It's just a stupid prank, Norma.Are you sure you don't need a ride?Good night, Dana. Dana exits through the front door. Norma stands up and moves toward the foyer.I like leaving them on.It keeps the Christmas spirit alive while we sleep.Everyone dies eventually, Norma. She stares at the tree.Why do you say that?Maybe not forever.Do you want to move?Why?No...No...Unless what, Norma? She reaches out and holds her finger over the button... thinking. She then picks up the business card with her other hand, flips it over and stares at the number.Are you gonna call him?What do you want to do Norma?Then push it.Well... if you don't push it... then I will.There's no turning back now. Seconds later... THE DOORBELL RINGS. Both Norma and Arthur jump in their seats.Thanks... we trust your word. Arlington offers him a broad smile.I got his license plate.What are you thinking, Norma?Did he mean that we're next? Is that what he meant?Who is this?Norma...Tell me this isn't real. Tell me this isn't happening.I don't think I believe you, Norma.An owl?Are you hiding anything else from me, Norma?Never read it.Arlington Steward... I remember the name now. He used to work atAn engineer at the NASA Langley research center was struck by lightning yesterday evening...The man received third degree burns over fifty percent of his body...He got struck by lightning on the night we received the transmission from Mars.You alright, Norma?Where are you going?Was that you on the phone? You're his mother...Wow.No. She reaches out with her hand.I'm not gonna touch you, lady.You called me a cuckold. You made a statement... made an implication to me that my wife was going to be killed.Norma... Her eyes open. She looks around... disoriented.Norma... what happened?I don't know.Yeah.Your mother did.I don't know.Where did you get this?You and Walter were there in the room. You were wearing a black dress, identical to the one you have on now.Walter had a blindfold on.Yeah.What's the last thing you remember?The play tells the story of uhree people, condemned to hell. They are to remain in a second empire drawing room for all of eternity. He closes the book... his mind dissecting what he has just read.They soon discover that their eyelids are missing... and for all eternity they will be unable to sleep. Norma remembers most of the play from high school.This is Sartre's vision of hell.Sure. Arthur walks away with Jim toward the edge of a PATIO that overlooks the whole party.Yeah... I know him. He works atNo...No...Yeah. Of course. Arthur looks down at the lawn. Norma is staring back at them.Why did you say that?In your speech. That joke about me killing you.Did your dad tell you about Robert Bevilacqua?He shot his wife yesterday morning. Did you know his wife?What do you mean?I.. I'm gonna be sick Walter... He places his hand on his son's head for a brief moment and then stumbles up the stairs. ON THE DANCE FLOOR... Norma is now slow dancing with Dr. Stupe.Bevilacqua...My wife.And now she's dead. Did you kill her?Where are you taking me? Bevilacqua retrieves a NASA DOSSIER from the dashboard and hands it to Arthur.Name sounds familiar. Does he work at Langley too?What are you doing?How is she going to die?Jesus! You're gonna get us killed!Yeah.Yeah...Thanks.What?Yes, sir.Norma! She hugs him... neither has slept in two days.I don't know. Reston steps forward.Yeah.My camera... took this photo...Something about breaking the chain. He wanted to find the next test subject... and prevent them from pushing the button. Cahill is writing diligently on his NOTE PAD. Reston can now feel something taking control of him... he looks to Teague... terrified. He closes his eyes... his body begins to twitch. Teague stares at his friend... realizing what is happening. Reston opens his eyes... now possessed... blood draining from his ears.Why...Is there an afterlife? The twins smile cryptically in response to Arthur's question.Because this is purgatory, right? The earth is purgatory... and you're here to start shutting things down... right? The twins appear impressed with his foresight.Right. I get it. Reston then turns to the window...Tell me this isn't happening, Norma.Yeah... and?Why?No... I don't. She manages a smile. A tear rolls down her cheek as she stares out at the pavement and the endless trees lining either side of the interstate.We need to kick the door down.Norma...I'm the one who told you to push the button... so don't apologize. He looks out through the window at his back yard... likely for the last time.I love you too... and please know... that I regret nothing in this life we've lived together.Well then.Yes. This is Arthur Lewis at 1560 Monument Avenue. I've just shot my wife... can you please send an ambulance? The Operator begins to ask more questions... but Arthur does not listen. He hangs up the phone. The thumping from upstairs has now subsided.Yes... can you hear me?What do you see? Where are you Walter?Can you see clearly?Everything is bright. Everything is bright Walter... you're gonna be okay, buddy.You're gonna be okay, buddy. That's all that matters.I'm sorry, Jim. He stares Arthur down as he is put into the back seat of the cruiser.

Her eyes light up, as she remembers the name and the box. Arlington then rotates his body... revealing the RIGHT SIDE of his face. Norma's eyes widen in horror at what she sees. Nearly all of the right side of his face from his cheekbone to his lower jaw has been burned away. His rear MOLARS and GUMS are exposed beneath the absence of tissue that is supposed to conceal them. Norma immediately feels a strange connection... a deep sympathy for him and the pain he must have endured.I assume you received the box that I left on your doorstep. His speech has a slight impediment from the burn that extends to the right side of his mouth.And you retrieved the button unit inside of the box. Norma smiles. He smiles back at her.Indeed. May I come in?Well... in a way, yes. I do have an offer to make.A financial opportunity. Arlington gestures toward the table with his briefcase.May I? She nods. He places the briefcase down on the table. He takes the button unit from her and sets it down on the kitchen table. They both sit down. He then withdraws a SMALL YELLOW ENVELOPE from his suit jacket pocket.inside of this envelope is a key. Arlington opens the envelope and withdraws a small METAL KEY.This is the key that opens the glass dome of the button unit. Arlington then inserts the key into a small HORIZONTAL SLOT at the top edge. He turns the key, and the LID that houses the GLASS DOME pops lose. The METAL BUTTON is now exposed.If you push the button, one of two things will happen.Then, you will receive a payment of two-hundred thousand dollars... tax free. Arlington opens the briefcase. Inside are neatly stacked rows of ONE-HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.The money will be delivered to you in cash. Norma covers her mouth... shocked at the sight of so much money.Mrs. Lewis, I can assure you that the offer is real.The guarantee of payment has several restrictions. One... I am not permitted to disclose any information about to the identity of my employers.You have until five o'clock tomorrow evening to make your decision whether or not to push the button. At that time, I will return to retrieve the button unit from you. It will be re-programmed and the offer will be made to someone else. Arlington places the key back into the envelope, seals it with crisp precision, and hands it over to her. He then closes the briefcase and stands up to leave.Until then... a good day to you, Mrs. Lewis. He nods his head and turns toward the foyer.My name is Arlington Steward, and I can assure you that this is no joke. The offer is real, but I am not at liberty to disclose any more information than I already have. He withdraws a BUSINESS CARD and hands it to her.Good day. He heads down the walk toward his car. She looks down at the card and sees that his name is printed in an embossed BLACK FONT:Hello Mrs. Lewis.Of course it is.Time is running out... have you made your decision? Norma looks to Arthur... who paces around the kitchen.When you push the button... somewhere in this world... someone you do not know... will die. I never mentioned the word murder.I'm not at liberty to disclose that information. Besides... it would spoil the fun.I am not at liberty to disclose any information about my employers. I can only remind you that the offer is real... .and it expires in approximately eight hours.Absolutely nothing. The reward is for you.Is there anything else, Mrs. Lewis? I have an appointment to make and I don't want to be late.Why... I'm looking at you right now, Norma.The grey spotted owl... in your back yard. Norma turns and looks out the large picture window in the kitchen nook. Outside in the back yard, an OWL is perched on a planter. The large bird sits motionless... its large SAUCER EYES do not blink. Norma stares at it for a long moment... transfixed. Arthur paces around the kitchen... facing in the other direction. Outside... the owl flies away before Arthur notices it.Hello, Mrs. Lewis.Do you have the button unit?And you must be Mr. Lewis.And the key?Thank you. Arlington then opens the BRIEFCASE and shows it to them. Inside... the bills are stacked neatly in rows.Two-hundred thousand. You can count it if you like. Arthur takes the briefcase from him and then closes.As you should. He then turns to leave.Yes.Why yes. That-'s how it works, Mrs. Lewis.Any harm that comes to them will be their own doing. Arlington takes the bag and moves toward the hangar entrance.Officer Burns... my name is Reston Steward.. an inquiry about my brother Arlington.Yes. My brother works at the Langley research facility.Have a seat... Mrs. Lewis. She looks around... realizing that the library is now completely empty.Don't be afraid. I may look like a monster... but-I can assure you that I am... only human. His face contorts into a broad smile.Please... sit down.Tell me Norma... when was the exact moment that you realized you loved your husband? There is something about him that now makes her feel safe... willing to tell him anything.And when was this?You became frightened about something.How did he respond when you showed him?Why?Did the glow disappear from his eyes?And what emotion did you feel when you first laid eyes upon me, Norma? She thinks silently for a moment.You felt what?Pity?You felt love for me?Why?Take my hand, Norma... She stares at him, unable to move... then takes his hand...Where is he?I need to see him... now.Hello Senator.Call me Arlington.Do you have my money?As much as it takes. Powell sighs out loud... irritated.First the nose... Powell turns around and there is now BLOOD GUSHING from his nose...Then the ears... BLOOD begins to ooze from both ears... as he covers his face... feeling the warm fluid rush from every orifice...Then the eyes...Bud... Bud grabs the briefcase from the desk and pops it open. He sees that it is filled with stacks of cash.You tell that sniper you have perched on that roof next door that I can smell his cheap cologne.I think it might be Old Spice. The Sniper smells his shoulder.Please have a seat. Reston sits down next to his twin brother... Arthur and Norma sit down across from the twins. Arlington has now locked completely into his brother's spirit... The movement of the two men is in now in PERFECT SYNCHRONICITY, staggered by exactly one second... Reston following Arlington. Arlington's eyes remain closed in deep concentration... Arlington's lips move silently... and Reston repeats them out loud. Reston's demeanor is now kind... gentle... almost apologetic for his past behavior.Mrs. Weller... do you have the button unit?", "clean_line": "mrs lewis arlington steward eyes light remembers box arlington rotates body revealing right face norma eyes widen horror sees nearly right face cheekbone lower jaw burned away rear molars gums exposed beneath absence tissue supposed conceal norma immediately feels strange connection deep sympathy pain endured assume received box left doorstep speech slight impediment burn extends right mouth retrieved button unit inside box norma smiles smiles come way yes offer financial opportunity arlington gestures table briefcase nods places briefcase table takes button unit sets kitchen table sit withdraws small yellow envelope suit jacket pocket inside envelope key arlington opens envelope withdraws small metal key key opens glass dome button unit arlington inserts key small horizontal slot edge turns key lid houses glass dome pops lose metal button exposed push button things happen receive payment thousand dollars tax free arlington opens briefcase inside neatly stacked rows dollar bills money delivered cash norma covers mouth shocked sight money mrs lewis assure offer real guarantee payment restrictions permitted disclose information identity employers clock tomorrow evening decision push button time return retrieve button unit programmed offer arlington places key envelope seals crisp precision hands closes briefcase stands leave good day mrs lewis nods head turns foyer arlington steward assure joke offer real liberty disclose information withdraws business card hands good day heads walk car looks card sees printed embossed black font hello mrs lewis course time running decision norma looks arthur paces kitchen push button world know die mentioned word murder liberty disclose information spoil fun liberty disclose information employers remind offer real expires approximately hours absolutely reward mrs lewis appointment want late looking right norma grey spotted owl yard norma turns looks large picture window kitchen nook outside yard owl perched planter large bird sits motionless large saucer eyes blink norma stares long moment transfixed arthur paces kitchen facing direction outside owl flies away arthur notices hello mrs lewis button unit mr lewis key thank arlington opens briefcase shows inside bills stacked neatly rows thousand count like arthur takes briefcase closes turns leave yes yes works mrs lewis harm comes arlington takes bag moves hangar entrance officer burns reston steward inquiry brother arlington yes brother works langley research facility seat mrs lewis looks realizing library completely afraid look like monster assure human face contorts broad smile sit tell norma exact moment realized loved husband makes feel safe willing tell frightened respond showed glow disappear eyes emotion feel laid eyes norma thinks silently moment felt pity felt love hand norma stares unable takes hand need hello senator arlington money takes powell sighs loud irritated nose powell turns blood gushing nose ears blood begins ooze ears covers face feeling warm fluid rush orifice eyes bud bud grabs briefcase desk pops open sees filled stacks cash tell sniper perched roof door smell cheap cologne think old spice sniper smells shoulder seat reston sits twin brother arthur norma sit twins arlington locked completely brother spirit movement men perfect synchronicity staggered exactly second reston following arlington arlington eyes remain closed deep concentration arlington lips silently reston repeats loud reston demeanor kind gentle apologetic past behavior mrs weller button unit"}}}
