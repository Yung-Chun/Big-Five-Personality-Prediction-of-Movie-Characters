{"Double-Indemnity": {"NEFF": {"raw_line": "Late enough.I'm fine. Let's ride.Okay.Uh-huh.Office memorandum, Walter Neff to Barton Keyes, Claims Manager. Los Angeles, July 16th, 1938. Dear Keyes: I suppose you'll call this a confession when you hear it. I don't like the word confession. I just want to set you right about one thing you couldn't see, because it was smack up against your nose. You think you're such a hot potato as a claims manager, such a wolf on a phoney claim. Well, maybe you are, Keyes, but let's take a look at this Dietrichson claim, Accident and Double Indemnity. You were pretty good in there for a while, all right. You said it wasn't an accident. Check. You said it wasn't suicide. Check. You said it was murder. Check and double check. You thought you had it cold, all wrapped up in tissue paper, with pink ribbons around it. It was perfect, except that it wasn't, because you made a mistake, just one tiny little mistake. When it came to picking the killer, you picked the wrong guy, if you know what I mean. Want to know who killed Dietrichson? Hold tight to that cheap cigar of yours, Keyes. I killed Dietrichson. Me, Walter Neff, insurance agent, 35 years old, unmarried, no visible scars -- Until a little while ago, that is. Yes, I killed him. I killed him for money -- and a woman -- and I didn't get the money and I didn't get the woman. Pretty, isn't it?It began last May. About the end of May, it was. I had to run out to Glendale to deliver a policy on some dairy trucks. On the way back I remembered this auto renewal on Los Feliz. So I decided to run over there. It was one of those Calif. Spanish houses everyone was nuts about 10 or 15 years ago. This one must have cost somebody about 30,000 bucks -- that is, if he ever finished paying for it.Mr. Dietrichson in?The name is Neff. Walter Neff.Look, it's Mr. Dietrichson I'd like to talk to, and it's not magazine subscriptions.How soon do you expect him?How do you do, Mrs. Dietrichson. I'm Walter Neff, Pacific All-Risk.Pacific All-Risk Insurance Company. It's about some renewals on the automobiles, Mrs. Dietrichson. I've been trying to contact your husband for the past two weeks. He's never at his office.The insurance ran out on the fifteenth. I'd hate to think of your getting a smashed fender or something while you're not fully covered.No pigeons around, I hope... About those policies, Mrs. Dietrichson -- I hate to take up your time --Where would the living room be?That's okay. I always carry my own keys.It's perfect for my money.With two f's, like in Philadelphia. If you know the story.The Philadelphia story. What are we talking about?It's on your two cars, the La Salle and the Plymouth.We've been handling this insurance for three years for Mr. Dietrichson... That's a honey of an anklet you're wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.We'd hate to see the policies lapse. Of course, we give him thirty days. That's all we're allowed to give.Could I catch him home some evening for a few minutes?That would be fine with me.No, the All-Risk, Mrs. Dietrichson. Why?If your husband's a member.Well, he'd have to join the club and pay a membership fee to start with. The Automobile Club is fine. I never knock the other fellow's merchandise, Mrs. Dietrichson, but I can do just as well for you. I have a very attractive policy here. It wouldn't take me two minutes to put it in front of your husband.For instance, we're writing a new kind of fifty percent retention feature in the collision coverage.I've had eleven years of it.It's a living.All kinds. Fire, earthquake, theft, public liability, group insurance, industrial stuff and so on right down the line.Accident insurance? Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.I wish you'd tell me what's engraved on that anklet.As for instance?Phyllis. I think I like that.I'd have to drive it around the block a couple of times.Who?Sure, only I'm getting over it a little. If you know what I mean.How fast was I going, officer?Suppose you get down off your motorcycle and give me a ticket.Suppose it doesn't take.Suppose I bust out crying and put my head on your shoulder.That tears it.Eight-thirty tomorrow evening then, Mrs. Dietrichson.Will you be here, too?Same chair, same perfume, same anklet?I wonder if you wonder.Is he sore, or just frothing at the mouth a little? Here, park these for me, sweetheart.Sure, I know Mr. Gorlopis. Wrote a policy on his truck. How are you, Mr. Gorlopis?Wait a minute, Keyes. I don't rate this beef. I clipped a note to that Gorlopis application to have him thoroughly investigated before we accepted the risk.Okay, turn the record over and let's hear the other side.And you loved every minute of it, Keyes. You love it, only you worry about it too much, you and your little man. You're so darn conscientious you're driving yourself crazy. You wouldn't even say today is Tuesday without you looked at the calendar, and then you would check if it was this year's or last year's calendar, and then you would find out what company printed the calendar, then find out if their calendar checks with the World Almanac's calendar.I love you, too.I'm considering it.That's okay. I was working on my stamp collection.Unless you have a bottle of beer that's not working.You did?But he's not?That's terrible.Don't bother, Mrs. Dietrichson. I'd like some iced tea very much.Fix it your way.Seeing it's the maid's day off maybe there's something I can do for you.Like running the vacuum cleaner.I used to peddle vacuum cleaners. Not much money but you learn a lot about life.Where did you pick up this tea drinking? You're not English, are you?They say native Californians all come from Iowa.Make it Walter.Right.Twenty percent. Why?I can always use it.Not for an executive, is it?You mean a crown block might fall on him some rainy night?But that's the idea.Bad.It could.Uh huh.Enough to cover doctors' and hospital bills. Say a hundred and twenty-five a week cash benefit. And he'd rate around fifty thousand capital sum.That's if he got killed. Maybe I shouldn't have said that.Mr. Dietrichson would understand. I'm sure I could sell him on the idea of some accident protection. Why don't I talk to him about it.They're all tough at first.Sounds pretty dull.Is that what you married him for?Anytime his thumbs get tired --How's that again.Wait a minute. Why shouldn't he know?A lot of people are. Funny, isn't it?Sure. I've got good eyesight. You want him to have the policy without him knowing it. And that means without the insurance company knowing that he doesn't know. That's the set-up, isn't it?I think it's lovely. And then, some dark wet night, if that crown block fell on him --Only sometimes they have to have a little help. They can't quite make it on their own.Of course, it doesn't have to be a crown block. It can be a car backing over him, or he can fall out of an upstairs window. Any little thing like that, as long as it's a morgue job.Not that crazy. Goodbye, Mrs. Dietrichson.Look, baby, you can't get away with it.You want to knock him off, don't you, baby.Who'd you think I was, anyway? A guy that walks into a good-looking dame's front parlor and says \"Good afternoon, I sell accident insurance on husbands. You got one that's been around too long? Somebody you'd like to turn into a little hard cash? Just give me a smile and I'll help you collect.\" Boy, what a dope I must look to you!I think you're swell. So long as I'm not your husband.You bet I will. You bet I'll get out of here, baby. But quick.Did I?Sure. Put it on the chair.How did you know where I live?So it is. Peel off your coat and sit down.Your husband out?I knew you wouldn't leave it like that.Like it was this afternoon.Okay.What do you want me to do?It can't be like the first time. Something has happened.That's what I mean.What's the matter now?What of? He's in Long Beach, isn't he?Maybe you oughtn't.If you want to.Sure. Right now.How were you going to do it?Kill him.I'm crazy about you, baby.That perfume on your hair. What's the name of it?We ought to have some of that pink wine to go with it. The kind that bubbles. But all I have is bourbon.Soda?Get a couple of glasses, will you.You know, about six months ago a guy slipped on the soap in his bathtub and knocked himself cold and drowned. Only he had accident insurance. So they had an autopsy and she didn't get away with it.His wife.And there was another case where a guy was found shot and his wife said he was cleaning a gun and his stomach got in the way. All she collected was a three-to-ten stretch in Tehachapi.See if you can carry this as far as the living room.A colored woman comes in twice a week.Once in a while I squeeze a grapefruit. The rest I get at the corner drugstore.What daughter? Oh, that little girl on the piano.Ever think of a divorce?I suppose because it would cost him money.But he had when you married him?And now you hate him.Nothing for you at all, huh?So you lie awake in the dark and listen to him snore and get ideas.Only sometimes you wish he was dead.And you wish it was an accident, and you had that policy. For fifty thousand dollars. Is that it?I'll tell you what it would be like, if you had that accident policy, and tried to pull a monoxide job. We have a guy in our office named Keyes. For him a set-up like that would be just like a slice of rare roast beef. In three minutes he'd know it wasn't an accident. In ten minutes you'd be sitting under the hot lights. In half an hour you'd be signing your name to a confession.Not if there's an insurance company in the picture, baby. So long as you're honest they'll pay you with a smile, but you just try to pull something like that and you'll find out. They know more tricks than a carload of monkeys. And if there's a death mixed up in it, you haven't got a prayer. They'll hang you as sure as ten dimes will buy a dollar, baby.Just stop thinking about it, will you.So we just sat there, and she kept on crying softly, like the rain on the window, and we didn't say anything. Maybe she had stopped thinking about it, but I hadn't. I couldn't. Because it all tied up with something I had been thinking about for years, since long before I ever ran into Phyllis Dietrichson. Because, in this business you can't sleep for trying to figure out the tricks they could pull on you. You're like the guy behind the roulette wheel, watching the customers to make sure they don't crook the house. And then one night, you get to thinking how you could crook the house yourself. And do it smart. Because you've got that wheel right under your hands. And you know every notch in it by heart. And you figure all you need is a plant out in front, a shill to put down the bet. And suddenly the doorbell rings and the whole set-up is right there in the room with you... Look, Keyes, I'm not trying to whitewash myself. I fought it, only maybe I didn't fight it hard enough. The stakes were fifty thousand dollars, but they were the life of a man, too, a man who'd never done me any dirt. Except he was married to a woman he didn't care anything about, and I did...Sure I believe you.You're not going to hang, baby.-- you're not going to hang, baby. Not ever. Because you're going to do it the smart way. Because I'm going to help you.Me.Sure I know what I'm saying.We're going to do it together. We're going to do it right. And I'm the guy that knows how.There isn't going to be any slip up. Nothing sloppy. Nothing weak. It's got to be perfect.You go now.Call me tomorrow. But not from your house. From a booth. And watch your step. Every single minute. It's got to be perfect, understand. Straight down the line.The first thing we had to do was fix him up with that accident policy. I knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted was his signature on an application. So I had to make him sign without his knowing what he was signing. And I wanted a witness other than Phyllis to hear me give him a sales talk. I was trying to think with your brains, Keyes. I wanted all the answers ready for all the questions you were going to spring as soon as Dietrichson was dead.A couple of nights later I went to the house. Everything looked fine, except I didn't like the witness Phyllis had brought in. It was Dietrichson's daughter Lola, and it made me feel a little queer in the belly to have her right there in the room, playing Chinese checkers, as if nothing was going to happen.I suppose you realize, Mr. Dietrichson, that, not being an employee, you are not covered by the State Compensation Insurance Act. The only way you can protect yourself is by having a personal policy of your own.I always say insurance is a lot like a hot water bottle. It looks kind of useless and silly hanging on the hook, but when you get that stomach ache in the middle of the night, it comes in mighty handy.Dollar for dollar, accident insurance is the cheapest coverage you can buy, Mr. Dietrichson.Just as you say, Mr. Dietrichson.Sure. All we need on that is for you to sign an application for renewal.Good night, Miss Dietrichson.Neff.This is where you sign, Mr. Dietrichson.The applications for your auto renewals. So you'll be protected until the new policies are issued.In about a week.San Francisco, Mr. Dietrichson?Great football school, Stanford. Did you play football, Mr. Dietrichson?On that bottom line, Mr. Dietrichson.Both copies, please.One is the agent's copy. I need it for my files.No hurry about the check, Mr. Dietrichson. I can pick it up at your office some morning.One forty-seven fifty, Mr. Dietrichson.Good night, Mr. Dietrichson. Good night, Mrs. Dietrichson.Fine.Sure he signed it. You saw him.Watch it, will you.Listen. That trip to Palo Alto When does he go?He drives, huh?Not this time. You're going to make him take the train.Because it's all worked out for a train.Look, baby. There's a clause in every accident policy, a little something called double indemnity. The insurance companies put it in as a sort of come-on for the customers. It means they pay double on certain accidents. The kind that almost never happen. Like for instance if a guy got killed on a train, they'd pay a hundred thousand instead of fifty.We're hitting it for the limit, baby. That's why it's got to be a train.Something the matter?For me? What for?Which way would that be?Oh, sure. Vermont and Franklin. North- west corner, wasn't it? Be glad to, Miss Dietrichson.Roller skating, eh? You like roller skating?Only tonight you're leaving it?That does sound tough, all right.You mean it's not Vermont and Franklin.I'd have to think it over.That comes expensive, doesn't it?Never use it, thanks.It'll straighten out all right, Miss Dietrichson.Hello, Nino.Look, sonny, she needed the ride and I brought her along. Is that anything to get tough about?Not so loud.Let me talk first. It's all set. The accident policy came through. I've got it in my pocket. I got his check too. I saw him down in the oil fields. He thought he was paying for the auto insurance. The check's just made out to the company. It could be for anything. But you have to send a check for the auto insurance, see. It's all right that way, because one of the cars is yours.Quick, open your bag.Can you get into his safe deposit box?Fine. But don't put the policy in there yet. I'll tell you when. And listen, you never touched it or even saw it, understand?Okay. When is he taking the train?What?What's happened?This one?Go ahead. I'm listening.That knocks it on the head all right.Nothing. Just wait.Until he can take a train. I told you it's got to be a train.We're not going to grab a hammer and do it quick, just to get it over with.Only we're not going to do it other ways.Plenty. But not as bad as sitting in that death-house.Just don't let's start losing our heads.We're going to do it right. That's all I said.It's getting me just as bad, baby. But we've got to wait.Good-bye baby. I'm thinking of you every minute.Hello, Keyes.Thanks. How would you like a cheap drink?How would I -- Do I laugh now, or wait until it gets funny?Me? Why pick on me?That's crazy all right. I'm a salesman.Nobody's too good to be a salesman.That'd bother anybody.It's still a desk job. I don't want a desk job.Walter Neff speaking.Of course I am. Can't I call you back... Margie?I'm listening. Only make it short... Margie.One hundred percent better. Hold the line a minute.Suppose I join you in your office, Keyes --Go ahead.Yeah -- sure.What color did you pick out?Navy blue. I like that fine.So long, Margie.I'm sorry, Keyes.If I told you it was a customer --Why don't you, for instance?Look, Keyes, I've got a prospect to call on.So you went back and started investigating her. That it?I get the general idea. She was a tramp from a long line of tramps.I don't think I want it. Thanks, Keyes, just the same.How about a wash job on my heap, Charlie?Anytime you get to it, Charlie. I'm staying in tonight.That left front tire looks a little soft. Check it, will you?You start just as soon as the train leaves. At the dairy sign you turn off the highway onto the dirt road. From there it's exactly eight-tenths of a mile to the dump beside the tracks. Remember?You'll be there a little ahead of the train. No speeding. You don't want any cops stopping you -- with him in the back.When you turn off the highway, cut all your lights. I'm going to be back on the observation platform. I'll drop off as close to the spot as I can. Wait for the train to pass, then blink your lights twice.Sure, I will. Just you take it easy going home.Can you make up my berth right away?I'm going back to the observation car for a smoke.No thanks, I'd rather stand.Palo Alto.Uh-huh.Used to be.My cigar case. Must have left it in my overcoat back in the section.Dietrichson. Thanks. I really prefer cigars. Maybe the porter --That's darn nice of you. It's car nine, section eleven. If you're sure it's not too much trouble.Okay. This has to go fast. Take his hat and pick up the crutches.Hang on to that rug. I'll need it.Let's go. Stay behind me.Get in. You drive.Let's go, baby.Sure, I'm going to kiss you.I love you, baby.It's okay, Charlie. Just walking down to the drug store for something to eat. Been working upstairs all evening. My stomach's getting sore at me.Let it go tonight. I'm busy.That was the longest night I ever lived through, Keyes, and the next day was worse, when the story broke in the papers, and they were talking about it at the office, and the day after that when you started digging into it. I kept my hands in my pockets because I thought they were shaking, and I put on dark glasses so people couldn't see my eyes, and then I took them off again so people wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them. I was trying to hold myself together, but I could feel my nerves pulling me to pieces....Okay.That Dietrichson case?Anything wrong?What have you got so far?When is the inquest?What do the police figure?I couldn't sell him at first. Mrs. Dietrichson opposed it. He told me he'd think it over. Later on I went down to the oil fields and closed him. He signed the application and gave me his check.He took it out a few days later, Mrs. Dietrichson.I could have hugged you right then and there, Keyes, you and your statistics. You were the only one we were really scared of, and instead you were almost playing on our team...Hello... Hello, baby.... Sure, everything is fine... You were wonderful in Norton's office.How do you think I felt? Where are you, baby?Okay. But be careful. Don't let anybody see you.Hello, Keyes.What's on your mind?What are you talking about?So what?What the dickens are you driving at?Because he didn't put in a claim? Maybe he just didn't have time.Sure, I did.No I haven't.Maybe Norton was right. Maybe it was suicide, Keyes.What else?Such as what?Murder?I'm sorry. Who do you suspect?The wife?You're crazy, Keyes. She wasn't even on the train.Good night, Keyes.Only you haven't got a single thing to go on, Keyes.It's not what he knows. It's those stinking hunches of his.Not if we're careful. Not if we don't see each other for a while.Until all this dies down. You don't know Keyes the way I do. Once he gets his teeth into something he won't let go. He'll investigate you. He'll have you shadowed. He'll watch you every minute from now on. Are you afraid, baby?What are you talking about?Shut up, baby.Hello.Yes. Of course.Sure. Come on into my office.Is it something to do with -- what happened?I'm terribly sorry, Miss Dietrichson.Lou, do you mind if I use the office alone for a few minutes?Won't you sit down?Queer? Queer in what way?Sure. We got along fine, didn't we.When your mother died?No. Who?You're not making sense, Miss Dietrichson. Your father fell off a train.Look. You've had a pretty bad shock. Aren't you just imagining all this?You don't like your step-mother, do you? Isn't it just because she is your step-mother?You'd better be careful, saying things like that.All this that you've been telling me -- who else have you told?How about your step-mother?And you didn't tell that boy-friend of yours? Zachetti.Where are you living then?Four walls, and you just sit and look at them, huh?About what?I'm listening.He wasn't?You're way ahead of me, Keyes.It's fancy all right, Keyes. Maybe it's a little too fancy.How do you do.Fifty-one, according to the policy.Never.Nope. Never fish.No relation.Mrs. Dietrichson?... This is Jerry's market. We just got in a shipment of that English soap you were asking about. Will you be coming by this morning?... Thank you, Mrs. Dietrichson.Come closer.Everything's the matter. Keyes is rejecting your claim. He's sitting back with his mouth watering, waiting for you to sue. He wants you to sue. But you're not going to.He's got the goods. He's figured out how it was worked. He knows it was somebody else on the train. He's dug up a witness he thinks will prove it.Yeah? And then you're in court and a lot of other things are going to come up. Like, for instance, about you and the first Mrs. Dietrichson.The way she died. And about that black hat you were trying on -- before you needed a black hat.I've been seeing her, if you want to know. So she won't yell her head off about what she knows.Keep her out of it. All I'm telling you is we're not going to sue.It isn't the money any more. It's our necks now. We're pulling out, understand.I said, leave her out of it.Stop saying that. It's just that it hasn't worked out the way we wanted. We can't have the money. We can't go through with it, that's all.Watch it, will you. Someone's coming.Yeah, and I was the one that fixed him so he was dead. Is that what you're telling me?Yeah, I remembered it all right. Just as I remembered what you had told me, Keyes, about that trolley car ride, and how there was no way to get off until the end of the line, where the cemetery was. And I got to thinking what cemeteries are for. They're to put dead people in, I guess that was the first time I ever thought about Phyllis that way. Dead, I mean, and how things would be if she was dead. Because the way it was now she had me by the throat. She could hang me higher than a kite any day she felt like it. And there was nothing I could do, except hold my breath and watch that day come closer and closer, and maybe pray a little, if I still knew how to pray... I saw Lola three or four times that week. I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes, after what I had done, but it was only with her that I could relax and let go a little. Then one night we drove up into the hills above Hollywood Bowl...Why are you crying?You won't tell me?Zachetti? What about him?What makes you say that?You promised not to talk that way any more.Sure, it's all in your mind.Hello, Keyes.What for?How do you mean?The somebody else?No kidding?No thanks, Keyes.I've got to get a shave and a shoeshine. I've got a date.They give you matches when they sell you cigars, Keyes. All you have to do is ask for them.Twelve.Phyllis? Walter. I've got to see you... Tonight... Yes, it has to be tonight... How's eleven o'clock? Don't worry about Keyes. He's satisfied... Leave the door on the latch and put the lights out. No, nobody's watching the house... I told you Keyes is satisfied. It's just for the neighbors... That's what I said. Yeah. Eleven o'clock. Goodbye, baby.Hello, baby. Anybody else in the house?What's that music?Just like the first time I was here. We were talking about automobile insurance. Only you were thinking about murder. And I was thinking about that anklet.I'm all through thinking. This is goodbye.It's you that's going, baby. Not me. I'm getting off the trolley car right at this corner.I have a friend who's got a funny theory. He says when two people commit a murder they're kind of on a trolley car, and one can't get off without the other. They're stuck with each other. They have to go on riding clear to the end of the line. And the last stop is the cemetery.You bet he has, Two people are going to ride to the end of the line, all right. Only I'm not going to be one of them. I've got another guy to finish my ride for me.You arranged it for me. I didn't have to do a thing.An acquaintance of yours. A Mr. Zachetti. Come on, baby, I just got into this because I knew a little something about insurance, didn't I? I was just a sucker. I'd have been brushed-off as soon as you got your hands on the money.Save it. I'm telling this. It's been you and that Zachetti guy all along, hasn't it?It doesn't make any difference whether it's true or not. The point is Keyes believes Zachetti is the guy he's been looking for. He'll have him in that gas chamber before he knows what happened to him.Don't be silly. What do you expect to happen to you? You helped him do the murder, didn't you? That's what Keyes thinks. And what's good enough for Keyes is good enough for me.Sometimes people are where they can't talk. Under six feet of dirt, for instance. And if it was you, they'd just charge it up to Zachetti, wouldn't they. One more item on his account. Sure they would. That's just what they're going to do. Especially since he's coming here, tonight... Oh, in about fifteen minutes from now, baby. With the cops right behind him. It's all taken care of.Right. And it's got to be done before that suit of yours comes to trial, and Lola gets a chance to sound off, and they trip you up on the stand, and you start to fold up and drag me down with you.That's cute. Say it again.Yeah, and for once I believe you. Because it's just rotten enough.Only you're just a little more rotten. You're rotten clear through. You got me to take care of your husband, and then you got Zachetti to take care of Lola, and maybe take care of me too, and then somebody else would have come along to take care of Zachetti for you. That's the way you operate isn't it, baby.I don't like this music anymore. It's too close. Do you mind if I shut the window?What's the matter? Why don't you shoot again? Maybe if I came a little closer?How's that. Do you think you can do it now?Why didn't you shoot, baby?Don't tell me it's because you've been in love with me all this time.I'm sorry, baby. I'm not buying.Goodbye, baby.Hey you. Come here a minute. I said come here, Zachetti.The name is Neff.Look, kid, I want to give you a present.Here's a nice new nickel.Suppose you go back down the hill to a drug store and make a phone call.The number is Granite 0386. Ask for Miss Dietrichson. The first name is Lola.Tough, aren't you? Take the nickel. Take it and call her. She wants you to.I know who told you that, and it's not true. She's in love with you. Always has been. Don't ask me why. I couldn't even guess.Now beat it. Granite 0386, I told you.That way.It's almost four-thirty now, Keyes. It's cold. I wonder if she's still lying there alone in that house, or whether they've found her by now. I wonder a lot of things, but they don't matter any more, except I want to ask you to do me a favor. I want you to be the one to tell Lola, kind of gently, before it breaks wide open... Yes, and I'd like you to look after her and that guy Zachetti, so he doesn't get pushed around too much. Because...Hello, Keyes.Up pretty early, aren't you? I always wondered what time you got down to work.Or did your little man pull you out of bed?Wouldn't be surprised.I wanted to straighten out that Dietrichson story for you.How long have you been standing there?Kind of a crazy story with a crazy twist to it. One you didn't quite figure out.That's right. You can't, can you? And now I suppose I get the big speech, the one with all the two- dollar words in it. Let's have it, Keyes.Thanks, Keyes. That was short anyway.What for? So they can patch me up? So they can nurse me along till I'm back on my feet? So I can walk under my own power into that gas chamber up in San Quentin? Is that it, Keyes?Well, I've got a different idea. Look here. Suppose you went back to bed and didn't find these cylinders till tomorrow morning, when the office opens. From then on you can play it any way you like. Would you do that much for me, Keyes?I need four hours to get where I'm going.You bet I am. I'm going across the border.Good enough to try for.That's what you think. Watch me.So long, Keyes.I'm fine. Only somebody moved the elevator a couple of miles away.You know why you didn't figure this one, Keyes? Let me tell you. The guy you were looking for was too close. He was right across the desk from you.I love you too.You know why you didn't figure this one, Keyes? Let me tell you. The guy you were looking for was too close.

What is it?Pacific all-what?Is there anything I can do?Perhaps I know what you mean, Mr. Neff. I've just been taking a sun bath.That's all right. If you can wait till I put something on, I'll be right down. Nettie, show Mr. Neff into the living room.I hope I've got my face on straight.Won't you sit down, Mr. -- Neff is the name, isn't it?What story?About the insurance. My husband never tells me anything.I guess he's been too busy down at Long Beach in the oil fields.I suppose so. But he's never home much before eight.You're not connected with the Automobile Club, are you?Somebody from the Automobile Club has been trying to get him. Do they have a better rate?No, he isn't.You're a smart insurance man, aren't you, Mr. Neff?Doing pretty well?You handle just automobile insurance, or all kinds?Accident insurance?Just my name.Phyllis.But you're not sure?Mr. Neff, why don't you drop by tomorrow evening about eight-thirty. He'll be in then.My husband. You were anxious to talk to him weren't you?There's a speed limit in this state, Mr. Neff. Forty-five miles an hour.I'd say about ninety.Suppose I let you off with a warning this time.Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles.Suppose you try putting it on my husband's shoulder.That's what I suggested.I guess so. I usually am.I wonder if I know what you mean.Hello, Mr. Neff.Aren't you coming in?I hope you didn't mind my changing the appointment. Last night wasn't so convenient.I was just fixing some iced tea. Would you like a glass?There might be some. I never know what's in the ice box. Nettie!...About those renewals, Mr. Neff. I talked to my husband about it.Yes. He'll renew with you he told me. In fact, I thought he'd be here this afternoon.No.Nettie!... Nettie!... Oh, I forgot, it's the maid's day off.Lemon? Sugar?Fresh.I didn't think you'd learned it from a correspondence course.No. Californian. Born right here in Los Angeles.I wanted to ask you something, Mr. Neff.Walter.Tell me, Walter, on this insurance -- how much commission do you make?I thought maybe I could throw a little more business your way.I was thinking about my husband. I worry a lot about him, down in those oil fields. It's very dangerous.He doesn't just sit behind a desk. He's right down there with the drilling crews. It's got me worried sick.Please don't talk like that.The other day a casing line snapped and caught the foreman. He's in the hospital with a broken back.It's got me jittery just thinking about it. Suppose something like that happened to my husband?Don't you think he ought to have accident insurance?What kind of insurance could he have?Capital sum? What's that?I suppose you have to think of everything in your business.You could try. But he's pretty tough going.He's got a lot on his mind. He doesn't want to listen to anything except maybe a baseball game on the radio. Sometimes we sit all evening without saying a word to each other.So I just sit and knit.Maybe I like the way his thumbs hold up the wool.I want to ask you something, Mr. Neff. Could I get an accident policy for him -- without bothering him at all?That would make it easier for you, too. You wouldn't even have to talk to him. I have a little allowance of my own. I could pay for it and he needn't know anything about it.Because I know he doesn't want accident insurance. He's superstitious about it.If there was a way to get it like that, all the worry would be over. You see what I mean, Walter?Is there anything wrong with it?What crown block?I don't know what you're talking about.Are you crazy?What's the matter?Get away with what?That's a horrible thing to say!I think you're rotten.Get out of here.Hello.You forgot your hat this afternoon.Don't you want me to bring it in?It's in the phone book.It's raining.Long Beach. They're spudding in a new well. He phoned he'd be late. About nine-thirty.It's about time you said you're glad to see me.Like what?I must have said something that gave you a terribly wrong impression. You must surely see that. You must never think anything like that about me, Walter.It's not okay. Not if you don't believe me.I want you to be nice to me. Like the first time you came to the house.I know it has. It's happened to us.I feel as if he was watching me. Not that he cares about me. Not any more. But he keeps me on a leash. So tight I can't breathe. I'm scared.I oughtn't to have come.You want me to go?Right now?Do what?Walter, for the last time --I'm crazy about you, Walter.Something French. I bought it down at Ensenada.Bourbon is fine, Walter.Plain water, please.Who didn't?Perhaps it was worth it to her.It's nice here, Walter. Who takes care of it for you?You get your own breakfast?It sounds wonderful. Just strangers beside you. You don't know them. You don't hate them. You don't have to sit across the table and smile at him and that daughter of his every morning of your life.Yes. Lola. She lives with us. He thinks a lot more of her than he does of me.He wouldn't give me a divorce.He hasn't got any money. Not since he went into the oil business.Yes, he had. And I wanted a home. Why not? But that wasn't the only reason. I was his wife's nurse. She was sick for a long time. When she died, he was all broken up. I pitied him so.Yes, Walter. He's so mean to me. Every-time I buy a dress or a pair of shoes he yells his head off. He won't let me go anywhere. He keeps me shut up. He's always been mean to me. Even his life insurance all goes to that daughter of his. That Lola.No. And nothing is just what I'm worth to him.Walter, I don't want to kill him. I never did. Not even when he gets drunk and slaps my face.Perhaps I do.Perhaps that too.The other night we drove home from a party. He was drunk again. When we got into the garage he just sat there with his head on the steering wheel and the motor still running. And I thought what it would be like if I didn't switch it off, just closed the garage door and left him there.But Walter, I didn't do it. I'm not going to do it.I've got to go now, Walter.Will you call me, Walter?Walter!I hate him. I loathe going back to him. You believe me, don't you, Walter?I can't stand it anymore. What if they did hang me?It's better than going on this way.You!Do you know what you're saying?Walter, you're hurting me.Straight down the line.If we bought all the insurance they can think up, we'd stay broke paying for it, wouldn't we, honey?Got some thing better to do?It's not that Nino Zachetti again?Now you're not going to take my car again.He was a Stanford man, Mr. Neff. And he still goes to his class reunion every year.I guess that's enough insurance for one evening, Mr. Neff.I think you left your hat in the hall.All right, Walter?He signed it, didn't he?End of the month.He always drives.Why?It's all right. Go on, Walter.I see.It's going to be a train, Walter. Just the way you say. Straight down the line.Walter.I wanted to talk to you, Walter. Ever since yesterday.But listen, Walter ---Yes. We both have keys.I'm not a fool.Walter, that's just it. He isn't going.That's what I've been trying to tell you. The trip is off.He had a fall down at the well. He broke his leg. It's in a cast.What do we do, Walter?Wait for what?We can't wait. I can't go on like this.There are other ways.But we can't leave it like this. What do you think would happen if he found out about this accident policy?Don't ever talk like that, Walter.It's not our heads. It's our nerve we're losing.Walter maybe it's my nerves. It's the waiting that gets me.Maybe we have, Walter. Only it's so tough without you. It's like a wall between us.I had to call you, Walter. It's terribly urgent. Are you with somebody?Walter, I've only got a minute. It can't wait. Listen. He's going tonight. On the train. Are you listening, Walter? Walter!He's on crutches. The doctor says he can go if he's careful. The change will do him good. It's wonderful, Walter. Just the way you wanted it. Only with the crutches it's ever so much better, isn't it?It's the ten-fifteen from Glendale. I'm driving him. Is it still that same dark street?The signal is three honks on the horn. Is there anything else?Color? Oh, sure. The blue suit, Walter. Navy blue. And the cast on his left leg.This is it, Walter. I'm shaking like a leaf. But it's straight down the line now for both of us. I love you, Walter. Goodbye.You all right, honey? I'll have the car out in a second.Take it easy, honey. We've got lots of time.Mrs. Tucker went along with her husband last year, didn't she.Remember what the doctor said. If you get careless you might end up with a shorter leg.It makes you feel pretty good to get away from me, doesn't it?Don't forget we're having the Hobeys for dinner on Monday.Maybe they do but I've already asked them for Monday.Don't worry.I said don't worry, Walter.I remember everything.Walter, we've been through all that so many times.Car nine, section eleven. Just my husband going.It's all right, thanks. My husband doesn't like to be helped.Goodbye, honey. Take awful good care of yourself with that leg.I'll miss you, honey.Good luck, honey.Walter.What's the matter, Walter. Aren't you going to kiss me?It's straight down the line, isn't it?I love you, Walter.How do you do.I've met Mr. Neff. How do you do.No. All I know is that your secretary made it sound very urgent.No. I remember some talk at the house ---- but he didn't seem to want it.I see.His safe deposit box hasn't been opened yet. It seems a tax examiner has to be present.What sort of things?Please.Thank you.He was perfectly all right and I don't know of any financial worries.Do what?I don't know anything. In fact I don't know why I came here.Don't bother, Mr. Norton. When I came in here I had no idea you owed me any money. You told me you did. Then you told me you didn't. Now you tell me you want to pay me a part of it, whatever it is. You want to bargain with me, at a time like this. I don't like your insinuations about my husband, Mr. Norton, and I don't like your methods. In fact I don't like you, Mr. Norton. Goodbye, gentlemen.I felt so funny. I wanted to look at you all the time.At the drug store. Just a block away. Can I come up?How much does he know?But he can't prove anything, can he?For how long a while?Yes, I'm afraid. But not of Keyes. I'm afraid of us. We're not the same any more. We did it so we could be together, but instead of that it's pulling us apart. Isn't it, Walter?And you don't really care whether we see each other or not.Hello, Walter.What's the matter?What's he got to stop me?Prove it how? Listen, if he rejects that claim, I have to sue.What about me and the first Mrs. Dietrichson?Walter, Lola's been telling you some of her cockeyed stories. She's been seeing you.Yes, she's been putting on an act for you, crying all over your shoulder, that lying little --Because you don't want the money any more, even if you could get it? Because she's made you feel like a heel all of sudden.Because of what Keyes can do? You're not fooling me, Walter. It's because of Lola. What you did to her father. You can't take it that she might find out some day.Walter, it's me I'm talking about. I don't want to be left out of it.We have gone through with it, Walter. The tough part is all behind us. We just have to hold on now and not go soft inside, and stick together, close, the way we started out.I loved you, Walter. And I hated him. But I wasn't going to do anything about it, not until I met you. It was you had the plan. I only wanted him dead.Yes. And nobody's pulling out. We went into it together, and we're coming out at the end together. It's straight down the line for both of us, remember.In here, Walter.Nobody. Why?A radio up the street.And what are you thinking about now?Goodbye? Where are you going?Suppose you stop being fancy. Let's have it, whatever it is.Maybe he's got something there.So you've got it all arranged, Walter.Just who are you talking about?What are you talking about?That's not true.And what's happening to me all this time?Maybe it's not good enough for me. Walter. Maybe I don't go for the idea. Maybe I'd rather talk.And that'd make everything lovely for you, wouldn't it?Listen, Walter. Maybe I had Zachetti here so they won't get a chance to trip me up. So we can get that money and be together.He came here the first time just to ask where Lola was. I made him come back. I was working on him. He's crazy sort of guy, quick-tempered. I kept hammering into him that she was with another man, so he'd get into one of his jealous rages, and then I'd tell him where she was. And you know what he'd have done to her, don't you, Walter.We're both rotten, Walter.Suppose it is, Walter. Is what you've cooked up for tonight any better?Walter!No. I never loved you, Walter. Not you, or anybody else. I'm rotten to the heart. I used you, just as you said. That's all you ever meant to me -- until a minute ago. I didn't think anything like that could ever happen to me.I'm not asking you to buy.
