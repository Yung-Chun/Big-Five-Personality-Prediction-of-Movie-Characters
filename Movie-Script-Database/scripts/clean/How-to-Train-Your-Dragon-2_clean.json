{"How-to-Train-Your-Dragon-2": {"HICCUP": {"raw_line": "This... is Berk. The best kept secret this side of, well, anywhere. Granted, it may not look like much, but this wet heap of rock packs more than a few surprises.Life here is amazing, just not for the faint of heart. See, where most folks enjoy hobbies like whittling or needlepoint, we Berkians prefer a little something we like to call--Dragons used to be a bit of a problem here. But that was five years ago. Now they've all moved in. And, really, why wouldn't they? The racers chase each other through a sprawling hangar and into a vast cave, teeming with colorfully painted dragon stables. They exit through the far side and circle back through the village, blasting past many of its dragon- friendly additions.We have custom stables... all-you- can-eat feeding stations... a full service dragon wash...Even top-of-the-line fire prevention, if I do say so myself. Astrid rolls her eyes, peels away from the other dragon racers, and yanks open a spout on the overhead network of aqueducts, dousing the flames with a surge of water. HTTYD 2 - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 4.Yep. Berk is pretty much perfect. All of my hard work has paid off. And it's a good thing, too, because with Vikings on the backs of dragons, the world just got a whole lot bigger.Yeah! They jackknife, heading skyward, rolling and tumbling through the ethereal cloud-scapes and joining high-flying Timberjacks as they soar in formation. Hiccup is bound head-to-toe in a snug, aerodynamic flight suit -- an asymmetrical, functional design of leather and articulated plates. It has an air of Viking bike leather.What do you think, bud? Wanna give this another shot?Toothless! It'll be fine. With a click of a lever, he LOCKS the pedals in the flared tail position. Hiccup then unhooks himself from the saddle.Ready? Toothless SNORTS unenthusiastically. Suddenly, Hiccup SLIDES OFF of Toothless, peeling away from him like a skydiver from a plane, YELLING as he plummets.This is amazing! A cloud layer washes past, exposing a towering ROCK FORMATION, dead ahead.No longer amazing! Toothless! Hiccup tries to steer himself away, to no avail. Toothless POURS ON THE SPEED, trying to catch Hiccup as he HURTLES toward collision. His locked tail makes maneuvering difficult. He's UNABLE TO PULL UP at a steep enough angle.Oh, no! At the last second, Toothless BLASTS the jagged rocks just ahead of Hiccup, then WRAPS Hiccup in his wings as they fly through it. The obliterated peak rains down around them. Toothless emerges through the cloud of debris and HURTLES into the trees of a neighboring peak. They tumble down the uneven terrain, coming to rest on a small plateau. Hiccup emerges from the cocoon of Toothless' wings. He switches his prosthetic riding foot to his walking foot and stows his leather wings.That really came out of nowhere. The blown up sea stack collapses.We gotta work on your solo gliding there, bud. That locked-up tail makes for some pretty sloppy rescue maneuvers, eh? Hiccup reels in his dorsal fin and removes his helmet, revealing a 20 year old Hiccup framed by wild hair, complete with a Viking braid. He walks to the edge of the cliff, taking in the NEW LAND stretching off into the horizon, its tall cliffs and sea- stacks adorned with swaying gold birch trees basking in the dappled afternoon sunlight. HTTYD 2 - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 9.Looks like we found another one, bud. Toothless FUSSES and SNORTS, not amused, shaking off dust and pebbles like a wet dog. Hiccup flinches as a pebble WHACKS him on the back of the head. He looks back to Toothless, who averts his eyes.Oh, what? Do you want an apology? Is that why you're pouting, big baby boo? Well... try this on! Hiccup TACKLES Toothless and tries to put him in a headlock.Ya feeling it yet? Huh? Picking up on all my heartfelt remorse? Toothless simply stands on his hind legs, lifting Hiccup off of his flailing feet and dangling him over the cliff's edge.Oh, come on. You wouldn't hurt aYou're right! You're right! You win! You win! WHAM! Toothless flips him over, pinning him to the ground. Hiccup squirms, throwing mock punches. Toothless playfully retaliates with feline taps to Hiccup's head.He's down! And it's ugly! Dragons and Vikings, enemies again, locked in combat to the bitter -- URFFF! Toothless rests his head on Hiccup -- SQUEEZING THE AIR out of him. Toothless then suddenly starts grooming Hiccup, lapping at his face and covering him in slobber.Gaaaaagh!You KNOW that doesn't wash out.So what should we name it? Toothless GURGLES as he gnaws under his wing, preoccupied.\"Itchy Armpit\" it is. Hiccup carefully draws the new island's outline.Whaddya reckon, bud? Think we might find a few Timberjacks in those woods? The odd Whispering Death or two in the rocks? Who knows... maybe we'll finally track down another Night Fury.`Afternoon m'lady. Where have you been?Avoiding my dad.Oh, you're gonna love this. I wake up. The sun's shining. Terrible Terrors are singing on the rooftop. I saunter down to breakfast, thinking all is right with the world, and I get...Okay, first of all, I don't sound like that. What is this character? And second... what is that thing you're doing with my shoulders?A truly flattering impersonation. Anyway, he goes... You're the pride of Berk, son, and I couldn't be prouder...WHEN have I ever done that with my hands?Okay... just... (holding her arms, mock-You're all grown up, and since no chief could ask for a better successor, I've decided--You're gonna wear out the spring coil. The calibration is very sensitive! HTTYD 2 - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 13.Yeah, so... this is what I'm dealing with.I didn't. By the time he turned around, I was gone.It's not me, Astrid. All those speeches, and planning, and running the village... that's his thing.I'm not like you. You know exactly who you are. You always have. But...I'm still looking. I know that I'm not my father... and I never met my mother... so, what does that make me? HTTYD 2 - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 14.Maybe. But, y'know... there is something out there.Stay close.What happened here? HTTYD 2 - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 15.Easy, bud.Astrid! Look out!Look, we don't want any trouble.Wait...You think we did this?What do-gooder -- there are other dragon riders?Drago what-fist? Does anything you say make sense?Just give us back our dragon, and we'll go, strange, hostile person whom we've never met.And this is Toothless. He says we're going. Now.Sorry. Got held up. Hey, Dad, could I have a word?Not quite the itch you're thinking of, but yes.Could we just talk in private for--Dad, this is actually a little more important than building saddles.But, seriously, I really need to tell you about this new land we came across.We didn't stick around to find out. These folks weren't particularly friendly.No, this was different. Not the standard run-for-the-hills hoo-ha I've come to enjoy. These guys were trappers. Dragon trappers. HTTYD 2 - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 22.I've never seen anything like it. And worst of all, they thought we did it!They are building a dragon army.Or at least the guy they work for is. Dargo Bloody Fist or something.Uh, yeah. Wait. You know him?What? Why?!Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait! What is happening?Because some guy you knew is stirring up trouble in some faraway land?Then let's ride back out there. We'll follow those trappers to Drago and talk some sense into him.It's our duty to keep the peace!War? Dad, if Drago's coming for our dragons, we can't wait around for him to get here. Let's go find him and change his mind.I have to.Come on!Nope. It's your lucky day. We give up.That's one Night Fury, one Deadly Nadder, and...... two of the finest dragon riders west of Luk Tuk. That oughtta make the boss happy, right?Excuse us. HTTYD 2 - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 27.Toothless, stay.The dragons don't really care for cramped spaces, so they'll just hang out with you. They won't be any trouble.Unless you do that. Wooden boat, big ocean. How's your swimming?Oops. Almost forgot. Can't have armed prisoners!Just what every dragon trapper needs. One end coats the blade in Monstrous Nightmare saliva. The other sprays Hideous Zippleback gas. All it takes is a spark and...Oh, yeah, there you go!Once they see you as one of their own, even the testiest dragons can be trained, right, bud?No game. We just want to meet Drago.Because I'm going to change his mind about dragons.Once you've earned his loyalty, there is nothing a dragon won't do for you.I can change yours. Right here. Right now.May I?Put me down! Snotlout! What are you doing?I DON'T NEED to be rescued!No.-- I'm trying to protect our dragons and stop a war! How is that irresponsible?Maybe.I'm still going to try.This is what I'm good at. And if I could change your mind... I can change his, too.Don't worry, bud. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. I promise. Toothless' ear plates perk up. He glances over his shoulder to see a disturbance in the blanket of clouds. A strange and arresting MASKED WARRIOR rises from the clouds, standing upon something unseen. Its armor and cape flap in the buffeting turbulence. The warrior eyes Toothless and Hiccup, pulling up alongside them. Hiccup senses the approaching figure in his periphery and sits up, flustered.Hold on, hold on. Toothless GROWLS a warning. Suddenly, they're ambushed from behind. Hiccup is plucked off of Toothless by another DRAGON and carried off.Toothless! With the tail unmanned, Toothless PLUMMETS helplessly. He FLAPS wildly then CRASHES through the ice into the black, frigid water. FLAILING and CRYING OUT, he struggles to stay afloat as he watches... Hiccup disappear into the night sky, carried off in the talons of the strange dragon -- one of TENS that accompany the warrior in a cavalcade. Toothless BELLOWS in distress, desperately trying to take to the air. As he LEAPS and CRASHES, time and again... A group of SPINY DORSAL FINS split the ice, carving a path toward Toothless. Beneath the ice, a pod of SEASHOCKERS approach, two-headed, with Manta Ray like wings GLIDING silently in the gloom. Fixated on Hiccup, Toothless is caught by surprise as the Seashockers surface and DRAG HIM UNDER. Hiccup's helmet bobs to the surface, marking all that remains.We have to head back for my dragon!Who are you? The Dragon Thief? Drago Bludvist?Do you even understand what I'm saying? HTTYD 2 - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 37.Toothless!It's okay. I'm glad to see you, too, bud. You really had me worried there.Uh, should I... should I know you?Hold on! Wait just a minute! Come back here!You can't just say something like that and run off! You're my mother?! I mean, what the -- do you grasp how INSANE it sounds?!Where have you been all this time?What've you been doing?! They said you were dead! Everyone thinks you were eaten by... Hiccup trails off as he enters...This is where you've been for twenty years?You've been rescuing them.Unbelievable.What? No. I don't know. It's a bit much to get my head around, to be frank. It's not every day you find out your mother is some kind of crazy, feral, vigilante dragon lady.I suppose there is that... ... one... specific... thing...I don't have the words.--I found him in the woods. He was shot down and wounded.Heh. Well, crazy thing is... I'm actually the one who shot him down.It's okay though. He got me back. Right, bud? You couldn't save all of me, could you? You just had to make it even. So... peg leg!He didn't take it all that well.But then... he changed. They all did. Pretty soon everyone back home had dragons of their own.No, really, I --Yeah, it runs in the family.How did you survive?Wait, that's the ice-spitter? He's responsible for all that destruction?Wow.Uh, yeah. I could eat.Hey, I thought we were going to eat?And from Dragon Island, I found this archipelago...Free.It's all well and good to call yourself a dragon.But can you fly?Oh no. Toothless!Man! Almost! We just about had it that time!Well, not bad yourself.Did YOU know about this?That sounds... amazing.This is so great! Now you and I can go talk to Drago -- together!But we have to --Meatlug! What's wrong, girl?Are you kidding me? How'd you get in here?We?Dad! There's something you need to know!This isn't an on-the-way kind of update, actually... HTTYD 2 - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 60.... more of the earth-shattering development variety.Dad, unlike most surprises I spring on you, this is one you'll like. I promise! You just have to handle it delicately, so...Dad, can you put the sword away... please?Mom, you'd never recognize it! Where we used to make weapons, we now build saddles, wing slings -- we even fix dragon teeth! You wouldn't believe how much everything's changed!Thanks, Dad.And once you move back in, with all of your dragons, Drago won't even stand a chance. Everything will be okay!Oh. Gotcha.Gobber!Toothless?What's happening?Oh, no...Welcome aboard, dragon rider!Oh, y'know. Catching up with Mom. HTTYD 2 - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 72.Well, now you know where I get my dramatic flair.There! Come on, Toothless! Show them what you got, bud. Toothless dive-bombs the swatter and DESTROYS it with a plasma bolt, freeing the dragon.Thatta boy!STOP! Stop!All of this loss, and for what? To become unstoppable? To rule the world?Dragons are kind, amazing creatures that can bring people together.Then why a dragon army?Or maybe you need dragons to conquer people.The world wants peace. And we have the answer, back on Berk. Just let me show you.Toothless? You okay, bud? What's going on?Uh, what did he just tell you?Toothless, what's the matter with you? What're you doing?Knock it off! Stop! Snap out of it!Toothless! No! Toothless! Don't! HTTYD 2 - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 79.Dad!No... you...No! Get away from him! HTTYD 2 - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 80.Toothless! Hiccup tries to go after Toothless, but Valka holds him back.I'm sorry, Dad.I'm not the chief that you wanted me to be. And I'm not peacekeeper I thought I was. I don't know...I was so afraid of becoming my dad. Mostly because I thought I never could. How do you become someone that great? That brave? That selfless?Not all of them.They're babies. They don't listen to anyone!Well, it's a good thing that I never listen.Get Toothless back and kick Drago's-And that thing.No...Toothless? It's me, bud. It's me. I'm right here. Come back to me.It wasn't your fault, bud. They made you do it.You'd never hurt him.Please. You are my best friend, bud.My best friend.Thatta boy! That's it! I'm here!Yeah!Hang on!Almost there, buddy. Almost there!We need to get those two apart.We gotta block him out, Toothless. Do you trust me, bud?We can do this. You and me. As one.That's it. Now let's try this one more time! HTTYD 2 - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 90.Shut it out, Toothless!Not again.Come on, bud!Hold on!Yeah! We did it!Hold him there Toothless!It's all over now.Oh, no! HTTYD 2 - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 92.He's challenging the alpha!Now do you get it? This is what it is to earn a dragon's loyalty.The alpha protects them all. HTTYD 2 - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 94.You never cease to amaze me, bud. Thank you.Toothless! You know that doesn't wash out.Y'know, Skullcrusher's gonna need somebody to look after him now.Thank you. I'm really glad you're here, Mom.Ha, ha. Still doing that one? That's hilarious.This... is Berk. A bit trampled and busted and covered in ice, but it's home. It's our home.Those who attacked us are relentless and crazy. But those who stopped them? Oh, even more so!We may be small in numbers, but we stand for something bigger than anything the world can pit against us.We are the voice of peace. And bit by bit, we will change this world.

He might very well be the last of his kind.And look, he's your age! No wonder you get along so well.And retractable teeth? Ah! How did you manage to--This Snafflefang lost his leg to one of Drago Bludvist's iron traps. This Raincutter had her wing sliced by razor netting. And this poor Hobblegrunt was blinded by a tree snare... then left to die alone and scared. And what of this? Did Drago or his trappers do this, too?What did your father think of your Night Fury friend?If only it were possible.-- Believe me, I tried, as well. But people are not capable of change, Hiccup. Some of us... were just born different.Berk was a land of kill or be killed, but I believed peace was possible.Stop! You'll only make it worse!It was a very unpopular opinion.

It's feeding time. Toothless tucks himself beneath Cloudjumper's wing, trying to befriend him, but Cloudjumper isn't having any of it. He grimaces and follows Valka out.Oh, we are.When I'm up here, I don't even feel the cold. I just feel...This is what it is to be a dragon, Hiccup.Incredible.All this time, you took after me. And where was I?I can teach you all I've learned, these past twenty years. Like...Now you can make those tight turns.Every dragon has its secrets.And I'll show them all to you. We'll unlock every mystery, find every last species, together, as mother and son.What? There's no talking to Drago.-- No. We must protect our own.Now come on, we should be getting back.Well, what sign did I have that you could change, Stoick? That anyone on Berk could?I pleaded so many times to stop the fighting, to find another answer, but did any of you listen?Oh stop being so stoic, Stoick. Go on... SHOUT, SCREAM, SAY SOMETHING!I'm... a little out of practice.No need for drastic measures.Yes!We have to save the dragons.You cannot take our dragons! They are controlled by the alpha!No. No.Thank you.I'll do my best! Come on, Cloudjumper!No!Stoick... She helps Hiccup to turn Stoick's body over. Valka presses her ear to Stoick's heart, confirming his death with a mere glance to Hiccup. He tears up, overwhelmed.It's not his fault. You know that.Good dragons under the control of bad people do bad things.No, don't!You came early into this world. You were such a wee thing. So frail, so fragile. I feared you wouldn't make it.But your father... he never doubted. He always said you'd become the strongest of them all.Go get `em.No! No...To protect you.
