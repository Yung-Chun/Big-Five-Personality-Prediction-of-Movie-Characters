{"Snow-Falling-On-Cedars": {"ISHMAEL": {"raw_line": "It was the first murder trial on the island in thirty-one years.Our only newspaper was the San Piedro Review, a four-page weekly that I operated alone.What, I wondered, could the Seattle boys know of the hearts of these people...Neighbors, sitting in judgement. On their neighbor.Kabuo Miaymoto sat with the rigid grace of a Samurai warrior. As if detached from his own trial.Did he know how dangerous his demeanor could be? With this jury.Hatsue Miyamoto had been without her husband for 77 days.He was in jail. When his baby son learned to walk.Earlier, I noticed her in the corridor.Are you all right?Please don't be like th...He was a mountain, all right. Anchored the line for us little fellers.Lucky I got the camera in my helmet.A gill-netter works through black nights with only himself to talk to. And learns to be silent. They were lonely men and products of geography....men who, on occasion, realized that they wished to speak, but couldn't.Three kids. What's she going to do?Excuse me, Gjovaag.Like the Sheriff, I did not work the sea, and could never merit trust. Or respect.So who talked to him? Out there.Let's say...someday I need some cooperation from you on this thing. Do I get it?Course, we grew up together.Her mom had this Mrs. Shigemura come on Wednesdays. Teach her how to be Japanese.Dances, calligraphy. Doing her hair. How to sit without moving...She would tell me stories of this woman and her lessons. As if complaining, or at least ex- plaining her world...But I always fantasized. The lessons were for me.My lessons came from my father. They were different. Or seemed so, at the time.He operated the Review alone, with an integrity and passion for principle that made him a figure of respect. If slightly larger than life.He never spoke of wanting me to succeed him. And, in truth, it was the last job on earth I thought I'd ever want.When I was five, he casually mentioned that if his sleeve got caught in the press, he'd be instantly popped open like a child's balloon, and splattered across the walls.Even his bones would disappear, to be discovered later on the floor, as strips of white confetti.Which, of course, made me certain that life would have no meaning until I could run that teakettle.He was, for better or worse, the only God in my life. I guess it's our nature to resent those we know we can never measure up to......which keeps us from accepting the warmth. The way we should.Every summer, after harvest, the Strawberry Festival was Dad's favor- ite story to cover. Good news was his preference. Making him an oddity among journalists.Highlight was crowning the Strawberry Princess. Always a Japanese girl, sort of an unwitting virgin sacrifice to the concept of racial harmony.Senior Year. It was Hatsue.She winked at me. In public. Which was unusual.I had kissed her once, when we were ten. Looking at fish through a glass-bottomed box. It was just an impulse, and no big deal.At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me. As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.I told myself that was good. That it made our friendship special. And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.I thought about her. Sometimes, all the time. I knew I was unhappy. But I knew if I told her...It might be a mistake. I could never correct.Do you know what I mean, Hatsue? I've always liked you.I knew in my heart that we would love each other forever.The way she kissed me. She knew it, too.She avoided me for a week.So this way, I could see her without...bothering anyone.I was certain everything would work out.And frightened.By two weeks, I knew I had made the defining mistake of my life.I'd ruined everything.Sorry. It sort of...happened, I just...I followed you. I'm sorry.I'm sorry I kissed you on the beach.Let's just forget about it. Forget it happened.Me neither.The best part was that there was a 'this'. To debate the wrongness of.Your friends would. Your dad would kill me with a machete.Why? We're only talking.We kissed for half an hour, that first time. And I knew there would never be another day like it.No matter how long I lived.Know where it is?It's in my other hand.Your mother went to the bathroom. She said I could show them a trick.I gave her all of my soul to love. I knew someday we would live in France. Italy. Somewhere. Far from the things that upset her.Well, I don't do it for just anybody.There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...Well. Since I never told your folks, I guess I'm lying to 'em, too. But you don't hear me complaining about it.Hey, Mr. Lamberson, over here!I have a radio, too. Don't you want to be sure I got the message?Just checking.It was a special edition, an extra. My father wrote, 'These people are our neighbors, they have sent their sons to the United States Army...''They are no more an enemy than our fellow islanders of German or Italian descent.'I guess courage never inspires the young. Until the danger of it bites their butt.It'll be over soon. I can get you money.It's just Pearl Harbor. People are a little crazy, right n...Maybe we can fix your eyes.Don't let this hurt us, okay? Whatever happens.See, you bring it on yourself. 23 ladies honored by the PTA, you single out three names. And they're all Japanese. That isn't journalism.Because journalism. Is just the facts.Hence. The letters.Integrity is expensive stuff, huh?It's not devious, it's what we have to do. You're leaving tomorrow...You write to my house, and put Kenny Yamashita's name on the return address. It's no big deal.You smell like cedar.Let's get married, okay?I want to marry you. Is that okay?When something that means your whole life. Is the last time ever...God should tell you. Or it's not fair.It felt right to me. It felt like getting married.On Monday, March 30, 1942, the United States Army graciously transported the Imada women to the docks.Lifelong neighbors came to watch. Curiosity masked as kindness......with some exceptions.Her letter reached me on the North Island of New Zealand. So I had a month to think it over...I wrote her four times. 'I hate you with all my heart. I hate you, Hatsue, I'll hate you always!'I never sent the letters. I wanted to kill as many Japs as possible.Eric Bledsoe was bleeding to death. Thirty yards away.I knew nothing could save him. Hell, I didn't have so much as a band-aid. I also knew I was a coward. For not giving up my life to try.I wanted to live. And I didn't know why.Some colonel came down the beach. Any man who didn't go over the wall at 2100 would be court-martialed, disgraced and imprisoned...The captain who followed said shot on sight.My arm was dealt with by a pharmacist's mate, whose surgical career was four hours old.He used a handsaw.I dream of it, now and then. The way my fingers curled. Against the wall....fucking goddam Jap bitch!It was all I could think of to say.There was nothing more to say. For a long while.Whatever she said, she was Hooks' star witness. The jury, especially the men, would not betray this fine lady with a not guilty verdict. How could they face her?My father had bought the DeSoto fifteen years before. Driving it reminded me of him. Which I considered a neutral fact...Actually, it was pleasant.Snow made all the fields into one. The notion that one man might kill another for a small patch, made no sense.But I knew such things occurred. Having been to war and all.May I give you folks a lift?I didn't look at her. I thought that would be best.Okay, I'll help.I know it's caused you trouble. But don't you think the snow is beautiful, coming down?We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...Maybe I should write a column. What do you think?I think people. Should be fair.I might just.I was part of her life again. I was a person.You have the night watch? On the radio.And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.All kinds of radio transmissions? Fisherman in trouble, and such.I'd been back two months. It was the first time I'd seen her.I couldn't say anything. I just stood there, hating her.The Japs did it.They shot it off. At Tarawa.I'm sorry, I'm sorry I said that.I'm sorry about everything. All of it.September 16. At 1:42 A.M., the dead of night. The S.S. West Corona, a Greek-owned freighter, was lost. In heavy fog.They radioed to the lighthouse. They would have to dogleg, bisecting Ship Channel Bank. And Seaman Philip Milholland wrote that down. In his report.Carl Heine drowned. In Ship Channel Bank. And his watch stopped. At 1:47.A huge freighter plowing through. Throwing a wake big enough to fling any man overboard.How long you have this detail?You mean, early morning the 16th?Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever. No one knows.Guess I'm not completely sure. What that was.I left the grocery, and wrote a letter. I apologizes from my heart. I should never have said that word to her. I never would again.It sat in my desk for two weeks. Before I threw it away.I knew her car. And sometimes when I'd see it, I'd...drive that way. At a distance.Can I talk to you?There's no one here, and I've got to talk to you.Don't you owe me that?I'm like a dying person.I don't sleep. I tell myself this can't go on, but it goes on anyway.You'll think this is crazy, but all I want is to hold you. Just once. And smell your hair.Look, I want to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.Please? As one human being to another, just because I'm miserable and don't know where to turn. I need to be in your arms. If it's just for thirty seconds.I drove from the lighthouse to my mother's place. I brought her some groceries.Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma. We just don't pretend we know.That's a long time ago. What a child feels...that's different.I felt Milholland's report in my pocket. And wondered why I wasn't telling her. Telling someone. What I'd found.Seattle boys think he's guilty. They say the evidence is rock solid.Those aren't the facts that matter.Someday I'll get lucky, too....but he found you.I'll stay tonight. Thanks for asking.I came back from the war to this room. I stayed a few months. Until my father passed.Well...I thought it then. And often since. A balance, he's said. Finding the facts. That folks needed to know.Milholland's report was like her letter. Something no one else. Would ever read.Thing about having only one hand. It's hard to tear pages up. And I wasn't carrying a match.So I thought of my father. The man who would have taken this report to Judge Fielding.But every reporter. Chooses his own balance. FInds the facts that matter.After all, the freighter was only a theory. It proved nothing at all. There were other facts. That mattered.Tomorrow I would write a column. About prejudice. And she would be grateful. For my large...and gentle...heart.Her husband would be judged. And she would be alone.Alone. The past looks different.I did. But the jury won't s...I know he didn't.I can't.Tell your mom. I want a rain check.Won't take two.You said there was a lantern in his hand. When you found him in the fog.And another one. Lashed to the mast?Two. Lanterns.It's the sheriff's math. I'm wondering about.I call it keeping your promise. We said if I ever needed some cooperation from you...Same idiots who'll believe you cracked this case. When I tell 'em you did.It's public record. If the public cares enough to read it.You said there was a coffee c...Actually. I was hoping you got it right. What's that, up there?Pieces of twine aren't nothing.Have a look. At nothing.You're right. I better use two.A dozen or more, all figure eights. All cut clean through on an angle.It's on the twine, too. But it's not r...There's a stretch of ground between guessin' and provin', Sheriff. I'll give you that.Not what I'm looking at. It's what I'm looking for.It's the way it happened, I know it is.You're wondering why I held it.Yes, he was.To my father. Everything counts.Well. It shows the prosecutor was wrong. It was Carl's boat that was dead in the water. Or he'd never have put up the lantern.That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.Because the second lantern, the one on the mast. Was never found. So we have to ask......where did it go?Maybe it went. Where Carl went. Over the side.That's when he fell.Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left. Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing. But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there. So he climbs up. To cut it down.Coincidences happen. You run a yellow light just as a car comes out of nowhere. Split-second tragedy happens every day. Or maybe...Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working. Same report Milholland heard. And that makes him get the lantern fast. Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.Then where's the lantern? And where's the knife?Coroner found an empty knife sheath on Carl's belt. But they never found the knife.He climbs up. His hand wound still bleeding. That's the blood I found on the mast. And the twine.He cuts the lantern free, the freighter's wake hits, the boat rolls hard, his bloody hand slips. tracing blood along the mast...He falls. The lantern, the knife, go into the water. Same as Carl.And inside the cabin, a coffee cup falls off the counter.But there's no one around. To pick it up.The freighter started through at 1:42. The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47.He hit his head. On the way in.The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely. We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel. Just below the mast.Anything. That had a blond hair.I'm sorry, was there a question in there?Twelve.My expertise. Is that I'm a journalist.And journalism. Is balance. Finding the facts folks need to know.Then putting them together. So truth is revealed.Oh, yes.But no other way. To explain them all.And since they all happened. This is the only explanation that's the truth.Like you couldn't believe.He didn't want to lose any more.He'd lost a lot in the war, you see. I had sent him away. To a concentration camp. But a nice one. Far less brutal than the Nazis. Because I'm a civilized person.That's how journalists. Answer questions.May I answer the question, Your Honor? Anout the defendant's motivation to lie?I didn't say. I did it alone.So there he was. His father lost his health there, finally died. They lost more than Etta Heine's seven acres. They lost their liberty, their dignity. Their ideals about this country.They lost their trust in us. We had treated them worse than animals. How would we now see tham. As human beings?This man lost a lot in the war. He didn't want now to lose his babies. Or the woman who loves him.And my expertise in this, sir. Is that I lost a lot in the war myself.And the fact that I am the only witness. Who placed his right hand upon the Holy Bible. Is the least of it, sir. I assure you of that.That's curious. I was appealing to their intelligence.No, sir, I can't. Not beyond a reasonable doubt.It's fortunate that the man who needs to prove his fancy story. Beyond a reasonable doubt. Is someone else.I'm sorry, Mr. Hooks. I apologize for my tone. This is not a contest. Between you and me.For it is not. As Mr. Gudmundsson so wisely put it. A small trial. In a small place.I lost more in that war than anyone will ever know. So did a lot of folks. And what we got back in return......was a country. Where a man was innocent. Until we proved him guilty.Whether we all got cheated. We're about to find out.Cigarette?I've always thought so.You ever been strangled by a single hand?Better take three...Maybe they'll keep us waiting.A reason.Your client's wife ever mention? We go way ba...We don't let go, you s...She was an honest person. Doing the best she could.It'll be there.God's kindness, my father said. Despite the hardship...it reminds us. Of our place in things.What the hell. Did he mean by that?Things fall on us, I suppose. From the sky.Wars. Freighters plowing through...And we seem...helpless. Until we understand.Accident rules every corner of the universe...Except the chambers.

struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a single overturned cup in its wake?My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that?If I did that Your Honor, I'd be dead.Right. In the middle. Of the floor.I think you testified all the lights were on. Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...And yet you started the engine right up. With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge. Did that strike you odd?Does it now?You have to wonder.You found three batteries, you say. A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery. A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8. It would be too large for the deceased's well.But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there. Why not use that?Maybe he carried a spare that was too large to fit. So he'd have to bang out the flange to squeeze it in?Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on defendant's boat?No spare.So the defendant went out fishing for the night with no spare battery, hmmn?I'm curious. The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?You don't. Think so.You don't. Remember.Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it possible. Possible that he struck his head after death. Possible?So this...foam you found in the lungs. How does it get there?Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.Your report says death by drowning, which means he went into the water alive and breathing. And the report is accurate...?Of course, it is. Now as to the head injury. You say made by an object narrow and flat. That is your inference, correct?In your motorcycle example. Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled against an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around? Or would both look the same.So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...Is it possible?Is it fair to say that you do not know for certain which it was.And that you can't say for certain whether the head injury was sustained before or after death?But you are certain that he died by drowning.Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand. The report says 'recent origin'. How recent? As much as 24 hours before death?Are you absol...Thank you, Horace. No more questions.Objection. Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.Just three questions. The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?Second question. What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it? If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.It is.You, too. No further questions.Your daddy played. I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?White or black?Nice. When two fellas understand each other.I think you like learning.Me, too. That's why I come.Bet there's a few things you could teach me. Kendo, for one.You're wonderin'...how come I never ask. If you did it.Now, you've told me you killed four men. In Germany. So I know you are the kind of man who can kill. When there's a reason.You feel guilty. That you took their lives. That's in your eyes.Prosecutor thinks. What was your reason? To kill Carl Heine.Well, there is the land itself. Raise your children where you were raised. Sleep with your wife at night, 'stead of bein' alone on the sea.There's fairness and honor. You were cheated by that old bitch. Boy, she is something.And prejudice, like you say. Your people locked in a concentration camp. You go off to fight for our country's freedom. Come back to this.But Mr. Hooks has missed the one reason. One reason. You coulda done it.I read you Etta Heine's deposition. So I could watch your mind. Like I do when you move your rook, or when I move mine.And you weren't thinking about her. Or about land. Or about you.No, someone cheats you, you can rise above that. You're a family man. You put them ahead of you, hmmn?Wasn't you she dishonored.Your father was a strong and tireless man. Honest to a fault. Kind, and humble as well...Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...Your father needs you. To return to your family.So every time you think about showing that jury strength. Or honor or composure. Or dignity.Show them an innocent man.Now your testimony was interrupted yesterday, when that power line set fire to your mother-in-law's farmhouse...How is your mother-in-law?And her farmhouse...?Well, just to put it back in our minds, could you repeat what you told us. About the type of batteries you found. One Carl's boat.Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in. Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.No further questions.So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all. It was human, yes? Type B positive.But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.And the blood could not have belonged to defendant. Seeing that his type is O negative.You scraped the dried blood from the butt of the gaff. Where a fella's hand goes. And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...?No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?Well, if the blood got onto the gaff by crushing a man's skull...You don't.The coroner testified that Carl Heine had a cut. A fresh cut. Probably one or two hours old.On the palm. Of his right hand.With no bone or scalp or hair present. Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull......or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable?You're right....that's the jury's job.So your husband said he's think it over. Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.So the defendant was encouraged to hope. Or could have been.I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.Of course not. But it was emotional. A friend's plea set against his mother's attitude.Those 'dirty looks'. Defendant ever aim one of those at you?Carl ever say he got one?You can speak for what he said. Just like you did for Mr. Hooks...Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...The question is more about the defendant's attitu...But Carl didn't say yes.Well, in the week that followed, the week before Carl's death... did your husband pursue him?And when did you first learn. That Carl had drowned?Thirty years fishing alone. Ever had an occasion to board another man's boat except in an emergency? Maybe to socialize or some such?Now, Mister Gi...Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?I'm sorry about that. It wasn't mine in the first place.So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare. Even though it was too large f...Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work. So how would he signal for help?All right, what if the defendant heard? So Carl let him aboard, to help. And then the fishing gaff?Well, what if?Thank you, Mr. Gillanders. Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.But the toughest scenario. Is the one Hooks will never raise.That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said. Gave him the battery. Like you said. Asked him about the seven acres. Like you said.Only. He said no.And something...happened. That you'd never planned. Because you're not a cold-blooded killer.You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is first-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.So if the jury thinks you did kill. but only in the heat of anger. They have to acquit.And you couldn't. Be. Re-tried.I want you. To tell the truth.I told your wife. Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks believe is true. That's sad. And it's real.A question first. Why do you want to know?I believe you are a good man. Who belongs with his family.And I believe. You didn't do it.Objection!...not a single witness has testified to anything that could suggest pre- meditated murder. Not in the days before Carl Heine's death...or at any time...has anyone described a murderous rage toward the deceased.Etta Heine had cheated his family. He had asked his childhood friend Carl to sell him the land. And Carl was considering it.There is no evidence of anger at Carl, much less rage, much less murderous rage. No reason for premeditation and no evidence of it. Anywhere.And yet the state is required to prove these things. Beyond. A reasonable. Doubt.Can you seriously think there is no reasonable doubt? Why is Kabuo's D-6 battery in Carl's well, if Carl was helping him?Why isn't the blood on the gaff more consistent with Carl's hand wound than a skull fracture? Given the absence of bone or brain tissue.What Mr. Hooks asks you to believe is that no proof is needed. Against a man who bombed Pearl Harbor.Look at his face, the prosecutor said. Presuming that you will see an enemy there. Treacherous by nature, by a thousand years of something or other.An argument I find as despicable as it is dishonest and twisted and insulting to us all. Mr. Miyamoto is a much-decorated hero of the United States Army. For God's sake.If someone said you should convict Carl Heine. Or his lovely widow. Of murder. Without proof. Because their ancestry is the same as Hitler's. You would spit in his eye.And every decent American. Would applaud you.Now Kabuo Miyamoto did one thing wrong. He was afraid to trust us, at first. Afraid that he would be crucified by prejudice. As Mr. Hooks is urging you to do.Well, we sent him. And his wife. And thousands of Americans to concentration camps. They lost homes, belongings, everything. We did that, folks. Can we now be unforgiving about his uncertainty? His mistrust?You may think this is a small trial. In a small place. Well, it isn't.Every once in awhile. Somewhere in the world. Humanity goes on trial. And integrity. And decency. Every once in awhile, common folks get called on to give the report card for the human race.Now here in America. We relish those chances. Give us that one, we say. That's why we built this country in the first place.Be Americans. Make your children proud.Well. It's imaginative......I'll give you that.No, you don't.That report. About the freighter? You didn't find that tonight, did you?You went right to the cell. Then to the boat. Then here. How long did you know about the freighter?This tastes horrible, hmmn?I'm wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones. in the middle of the night.Your daddy. Was quite a feller.He's looking down. And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday. He's proud of the man you are tonight. That's what counts.What if I told you he once said to me...don't matter the road we take. Just so we get there.Doesn't make me wrong.All right, let's say that twine had been there to lash a lantern. That it had come from the shuttle of twine found in the deceased's pocket.Now to re-open a trial that had gone to jury...new evidence should be pretty important.Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.Now you believe there were two lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand. The second lashed to the mast.Well, why does it?Your Honor, all of this is speculation. Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.So how does this fit with what you told us at the start? The freighter that plowed through Ship Channel Bank...Fell.Still lashed to the mast.Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?Maybe...?But you could be wrong. He could have climbed up earlier.The knife. What knife?Still a coincidence. Timing and all.Still and all. Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...You think so?Well, anything coulda caused that.Request introduction of Exhibit 18. One single blond hair. Which Sheriff Moran dug out of that fracture. Below the mast. Of Carl Heine's boat.We will call Sheriff Moran, who will confirm this. And Coroner Whaley to testify that the damage to the gunnel is of a size and nature not inconsistent with the deceased's skull fracture...But for now. Your witness...All things considered......you were adequate.I could make a few quibbles, but I am loathe to hurt your feelings.I'll take two. One for later.If I whistle. Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'. You're the story today.Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.Prejudice is like any obsession.There's a reason why we can't let go. Even when we want to.Hate or love. It works the same.It's a rare thing. Takes a turning point.You gave this jury three chances. To turn.No other way to explain it all. That was one. I caught some of 'em fluttering, waking up, on that.Second. You sent him to Manzanar, and you didn't do it alone. I liked that one, they didn't. No surprise.Last. You gave your arm. To buy this woman back her husband. Are they gonna cheat you out of that?Some let go, some don't. Where did you?The prosecutor, the judge, cut her off. She was desperate. Her husband helpless...I was helpless...You couldn't let her. Be helpless.When this verdict is read. She may look for your face.Here's what she needs to see: This is nothing.
