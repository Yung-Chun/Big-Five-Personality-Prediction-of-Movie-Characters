{"Princess-Bride-The": {"WESTLEY": {"raw_line": "As you wish.As you wish.As you wish.Of course you will.Hear this now: I will come for you.This is true love. You think this happens every day?Can you move at all?I told you, \"I would always come for you.\" Why didn't you wait for me?Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.There will never be a need.Ha. Your pig fiance is too late. A few more steps and we'll be safe in the Fire Swamp.Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 57.It's not that bad. I'm not saying I'd like to build a summer home here, but the trees are actually quite lovely.Well now, that was an adventure.Singed a bit, were you?Well, one thing I will say. The Fire Swamp certainly does keep you on your toes.This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship \"Revenge\" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 59.You see, what I told you before about saying \"please\" was true. It intrigued Roberts, as did my descriptions of your beauty.Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, \"All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning.\" Three years he said that. \"Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning.\" It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.Well, Roberts had grown so rich, he wanted to retire. So he took me to his cabin and told me his secret. \"I am not the Dread Pirate Roberts,\" he said. \"My name is Ryan. I inherited this ship from the previous Dread Pirate Roberts, just as you will inherit it from me. The man I inherited it from was not the real Dread Pirate Roberts, either. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 60.His name was Cummerbund. The real Roberts has been retired fifteen years and living like a king in Patagonia.\" Then he explained the name was the important thing for inspiring the necessary fear. You see, no one would surrender to the Dread Pirate Westley.So we sailed ashore, took on an entirely new crew and he stayed aboard for awhile as first mate, all the time calling me Roberts. Once the crew believed, he left the ship and I have been Roberts ever since. Except, now that we're together, I shall retire and hand the name over to someone else. Is everything clear to you?No. No. We have already succeeded.I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...Now, was that so terrible? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 64.You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.It will not happen!DEATH FIRST!!What was that?We are men of action. Lies do not become us.You have six fingers on your right hand -- someone was looking for you --Where am I? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 68.Then I'm here till I die?Then why bother curing me?So it's to be torture.I can cope with torture.You don't believe me?... tr ... oooo .... luv...I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.Why won't my arms move?Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.I've always been a quick healer. What are our liabilities?And our assets?That's it? Impossible. If I had a month to plan, maybe I could come up with something. But this...My brains, his steel, and your strength against sixty men, and you think a little head jiggle is supposed to make me happy? I mean, if we only had a wheelbarrow, that would be something.Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.All right, all right. Come on, help me up.Now, I'll need a sword eventually. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 101.True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it? Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.Not yet.Light him.FEZZIK, the portcullis. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 106.Give us the gate key.There's a shortage of perfect breasts in this world. It would be a pity to damage yours.Gently.Gently!!What hideous sin have you committed lately?It never happened.It never happened. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 117.Did you say, \"I do\"?Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?No. To the pain.I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.It won't be the last. To the pain means the first thing you lose will be your feet, below the ankles, then your hands at the wrists, next your nose.I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why ---- so that every shriek of every child at seeing your hideousness will be yours to cherish -- every babe that weeps at your approach, every woman who cries out, \"Dear God, what is that thing?\" will echo in your perfect ears. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 119.That is what \"to the pain\" means. It means I leave you in anguish, wallowing in freakish misery forever.It's possible, pig -- I might be bluffing -- it's conceivable, you miserable vomitous mass, that I'm only lying here because I lack the strength to stand -- then again, perhaps I have the strength after all.DROP-YOUR-SWORD.Have a seat.Tie him up. Make it as tight as you like.I thought he was with you.In that case --Thank you, but no -- whatever happens to us, I want him to live a long life alone with his cowardice.Have you ever considered piracy?

My God! He's climbing.I want to duel him left-handed.Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.Hello there.Slow going?Sorry.I do not suppose you could speed things up?I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.You don't know any way you'll trust me?I swear on the soul of my father, Domingo Montoya, you will reach the top alive.We'll wait until you're ready.I do not mean to pry, but you don't by any chance happen to have six fingers on your right hand?My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.The six-fingered man returned and demanded it, but at one-tenth his promised price. My father refused. Without a word, the six-fingered man slashed him through the heart. I loved my father, so, naturally, challenged his murderer to a duel ... I failed ... --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 29.the six-fingered man did leave me alive with the six-fingered sword, but he gave me these.I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, \"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\"More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.You are ready, then?You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.Begin!You're using Bonetti's defense against me, ah? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 31.Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.Unless the enemy has studied his Agrippa--- which I have.You are wonderful!I admit it -- you are better than I am.Because I know something you don't know.I am not left-handed.I ought to be after twenty years.Tell me.Who are you?!I must know.Okay.Kill me quickly.I am waiting for you, Vizzini. You told me to go back to the beginning. So I have. This is where I am, and this is where I'll stay. I will not be moved.I do not budge. Keep your \"Ho there.\"-- So did Vizzini -- when a job went wrong, you went back to the beginning. And this is where we got the job. So it's the beginning, and I'm staying till Vizzini comes.-- I -- am -- waiting -- for -- Vizzini -- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 80.It's you.Perhaps not. I feel fine.That's enough. That's enough! Where is this Rugen so I may kill him?How many could you handle?That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many. I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 82.No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black ---- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --To find the Man in Black, obviously.Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace.There will be blood tonight!!His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering? Excuse me ---- pardon me, it's important ---- Fezzik, please --Thank you.Where is the Man in Black?You get there from this grove, yes?Fezzik, jog his memory.Father, I have failed you for twenty years. Now our misery can end. Somewhere ... somewhere close by is a man who can help us. I cannot find him alone. I need you. I need you to guide my sword. Please.Guide my sword.It just is not fair.Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.Have you any money?I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 91.Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?We need a miracle. It's very important. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 92.He's already dead.Sir. Sir.We're really in a terrible rush.Sixty-five.This is noble, sir. His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.He's dead. He can't talk.What's that?True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.-- But this is Buttercup's true love -- If you heal him, he will stop Humperdinck's wedding.Humiliations galore!That's a miracle pill?Thank you for everything.What's the difference? We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.Your guess is as good as mine --We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.Let me explain -- -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 99.Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.There is but one working castle gate.And it is guarded by sixty men.Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?There we cannot help you.Where did you get that?Why? You can't even lift one.I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --Right, right, sorry.What?Now?Now?Fezzik, tear his arms off.Hello.
