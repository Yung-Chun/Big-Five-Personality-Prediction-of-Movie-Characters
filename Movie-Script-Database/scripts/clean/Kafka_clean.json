{"Kafka": {"KAFKA": {"raw_line": "I gave it to him yesterday.No, I left it in his office.I've never seen him. I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.I'll commit that to memory.I'm sorry to disturb you -- I wonder if you know where my friend Eduard is?-- I didn't want to bother you.My friend Eduard, I wonder if you've seen him? He hasn't been in to work, I thought he might be ill.You didn't have to get out of bed -- I could have taken the key.Well, he's not here.Do you think you ought to do that?Miss Rossmann?I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --I'm sorry, but I just wondered --Hello.I'd like to hear them.I've lived all my life in this city -- it frightens me. As it draws me closer into its web.No, but do you realize why? -- it has no present.Even the so-called New Town isn't so new. Only the people. People of the future living in buildings of the past. Has anyone seen Eduard?What d'you mean, oh him? He's a perfectly nice person, he's never missed a day before.No, it's me who always wanted to run away with them -- except that that life would be far too hectic for me. I'm worried about him, no one's seen him.When you work for a medical firm you can't call in sick. They know malingerers like a dog knows fleas.You have been hearing the sordid side then.My father always said I had no ambition.I've never seen you here before.Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.No, really, I have to go home too.Up there.It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.A glorified office block. They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.It's more than hollow. It's stillborn. For all its size it serves no purpose. It's just there -- like death -- hovering over a breathing city.I'm writing a story about a man who wakes up one morning to find himself transformed into a giant insect.I don't know what you could have read.-- In magazines nobody reads.Did you?\"As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from disturbing dreams he ... from unsettling dreams ... uneasy dreams ... Gregor Samsa ... Gregor ...?\" Carl. George. Rudolf ...... Yes.... Yes.Yes. Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?Wednesday. We left the office together.No, we said goodbye outside the building. He went off, as usual, toward his house.-- Accident and Compensation Association.Eight -- and seven months.Well -- other departments are, yes.Yes. Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends. How was Eduard ...I don't know.No. He didn't seem to be. Do you think he drowned himself?No, I suppose not.Can I ask -- how you found me?I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.He wasn't a lonely man, though.... Just a perception.Probably not.I'll bear that in mind.You wanted to see me, sir.... My ... social situation?To do my work well, I have little time for --I usually take lunch by the River.I did not realize it was obligatory.No, sir.Well, I ---- Eduard --In a small way.My assistants, I presume.I'm Kafka.You look like brothers.Have you worked here long?Well, we'd better move things from my old desk.On the Embankment.No.I suspected that he -- well.That he was -- satisfied in that regard. I didn't want to pry.This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.How long were you and Eduard --No, I don't. I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?He wasn't robbed. He was identified by his wallet.When I have no reason to doubt.-- What could he have done to warrant that?Tonight?... All right.Last year. I -- it was broken off.And you ...?-- I don't know the Musil district.Strangers make better foes than friends. Will you tell me who you are altogether, if not individually?Ah -- we're back to the \"authorities\" you spoke of.... Was Eduard one of you?... Why take me into your confidence?I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.The distance to my fellow man is for me quite a journey. As for being an outsider, it's never been a matter of choice.What proceedings?What of it?And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.I have no right to be, I know. My experience with real life is practically nil.People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.Propaganda of the dead?So that's who my foes are -- policemen and file clerks. Law and order, you might say.My only concern is the human tribunal. Isn't it yours?At the cost of others? You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony. Did you go to the Castle with Eduard? Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.How was your evening?What was the matter with it?Do you?I didn't realize you'd been here that long.You don't think it's a horrible double life from which there is probably no escape but insanity?I'm glad for you.Yes.Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?Why were you given notice?It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.You don't believe that.It seems I knew Eduard a little bit, after all.Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides. It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.Burgel doesn't like anybody!He's jealous, yes, but that jealous? He's too cautious.Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?I've heard of it happening.Usually.First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel. If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.Now Burgel's one of the authorities?You won't make any sense of it while you're upset.... I don't see anything. I see a message on its way to me -- with all the right answers. Only it never arrives -- it's always just on its way.But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one. I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one shut -- not at all.If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible?You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant. When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.She's missing. I went to her house and she hadn't returned there.Maybe it's true then what she said.That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.-- She didn't think Eduard committed suicide. Any more than I do. She was convinced of it.Good question. Who are my friends ... would also be of interest.Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.Bachelorhood is just the slow form. The bachelor doesn't sew seeds. Only the moment matters. The space he occupies grows smaller and smaller -- until the only space right for him is his coffin.Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.I haven't got the energy. I mean, I have to conserve my energy.That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.No -- not even success. My writing is not for making a living -- it's for living. Not for other people, it's for me.... I'm the exile. Gabriela was right about that too.That's mad.-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful. If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small. No poor young clerk could find himself in such a fix.He worked on routine claims. His visit to the Castle was probably as minor a mission as he said it was.Then why haven't I been --Oh, Burgel! Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard. They were both members of this group. If any crime's been discovered and people are paying for it, I'd look to yourselves!It usually is.Yes. Isn't it there?He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance departmentWhat's the matter?It's gone out so quickly?-- You mean my Chief has it.Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.I wonder if I might look to see if there's an address for family -- I thought I'd like to write to them.No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation. He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.Yes, sir.Orlac is an account?All these in the last year?I did read that. They gave him a posthumous medal.This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?What if I petitioned one of the Directors?Where do our records go to in the Castle?I could always apply there.Do you mind!You mean you've actually begun some?My assistants! You might as well have fallen from the sky for all the thought that was spent in choosing you!What's the matter with you?-- You should meet my father.All right, you might as well go home -- go on.-- Help! HELP!So. You're the guides up there. And we thought it was Burgel.I don't want any favors from the Castle -- just my rights.For all your incompetence I was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me. You're very good ham actors.It's a farce.What position? Being prosecuted in a case like this means having already lost it.Close only by virtue of antithesis.My assistants. I should have known. Nothing is given to me. I have to acquire everything.It would be more accurate to say that it has pursued me.You've dropped some money.You work in the cemetery.The Castle cemetery.Official channels -- a lot of good they've done me. My only hope is to approach the officials personally.The Kafka men are famous for it, you know. Delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter, picking up sacks of flour with their teeth ---- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally? -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something. Isn't there?An empty tomb?Not a chance. I'm the thinnest person I know.-- You appreciate my writing.Will you do me a favor then?If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them. All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.It's my last and final one.A true friend would do it.I didn't --I'm, uh, looking for the Medical Records Section.Thank you.No ...... I'm new.Are you the Head of Medical Records?... A piece of paper ...... A piece of paper ...It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.\"Accident and Compensation\" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see. And I find you. A body snatcher.And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in. You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.Lying in the gutter where they belong.The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?Gabriela! -- you did get away.-- I've just come from the Castle. It's over.Gabriela ...?I -- I found your jailer.They're dead now. We can get help.There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.I told you, they're dead. It's finished.No -- not this time.-- Listen to me ---- Gabriela!", "clean_line": "gave yesterday left office ve seen believe keeper files hasn noticed right burgel thought easier long passing

2:30.Hello again.Have you looked?Yes.Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.Not today, Burgel. Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.You're just doing your job.You're detestable.Eduard and I had lunch together one day ... and you saw us.I was having an affair with Eduard. He didn't tell you?He would have. You were his best friend. A better friend than me.What?It's not that we wanted to deceive anyone -- but you know how these things are looked upon at the office.What's funny?As long as it's on their terms. If your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.Two or three months, that's all. -- I seduced him.You know as well as I do that he didn't commit suicide.Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here? This will always be the ghetto.And you believe everything the authorities tell you.The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests. For all you know he was killed at the hands of the police.Are you free tonight?There are some people I'd like you to meet. Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?You almost married recently, didn't you?Eduard wanted to marry me.I'm suspicious of men who want to marry. I believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.You won't have any trouble finding it.They're ubiquitous. What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.I nominated you as a possible candidate. You were Eduard's good friend. He read me some of your work.You strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men. And yet you're able to remain an outsider. With the concomitant air of ... superiority?The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle. Did you know that?He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division. Apparently one of his claims was relevant.He was never seen alive again.He was murdered.You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.As the bomb never went off, we can only assume he was caught with it -- and summarily executed.You think what we're doing is so wrong? And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness? For what? To answer to some supreme tribunal?Yes -- which is why \"quiet, dependable people\" have to take charge of their own lives.Your human tribunal will betray you. Just as its members will be betrayed when they find no supreme oneJoin us, Kafka.It's sheer folly for anyone to try to pull through alone.I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.They're not obliged to tell.Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember. He could've killed Eduard.I wouldn't put it past him.You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.It's still easier for you to understand suicide, isn't it.Burgel hated Eduard. And me. I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark. People disappear up there regularly. If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?Or what if there really was an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it? One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.For all his big talk he is. Does he really have access to the Directors of the firm as he always claims? -- or only the Deputy Managers -- people of no importance whatsoever. Someone ought to follow him for a change.Burgel is only there for one purpose -- to spy on the employees and report any and all indiscretions, real or imagined. If he didn't send Eduard to the Castle, you can be damn sure he's in league with whoever greeted him there. All those bastards are in league with each other -- why can't you see that!Eduard ...Your ignorance of the way things are here is so appalling that it makes my head spin to listen to you and compare what you say and have in mind with the real situation!I knew you walked this way to work. I wanted to find you before they did.Over? It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss. It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.Have you ever watched a person deteriorate? Day by day. I don't mean in a spiritual sense.Only two steps back? Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.This is the result of their elixir of youth. They were to come and check on it during the night. I contrived to miss the appointment.I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.I know there is. And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.Why should I believe a man who never believed me? They're absolutely right, you know -- guilt should never be doubted. It's easier that way.I think you've just escaped for the moment. Just as I did. As Eduard did. As they let us do. But only for the moment.I know better than you what people will say when they have to. When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.I do. Always. You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka. And what it's becoming.
