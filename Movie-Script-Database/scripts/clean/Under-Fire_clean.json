I didn't know you were here.Well... yeah... you looked great. Why aren't you partying?I printed that up for Alex.Jesus, I'm sorry. Who left who this time?That's pretty clean.To cover you or the war?I don't want to wait for you again. We've been circling each other since the Montreal Olympics.Thanks.Wait here.You have something to do with this?Nifty.I'm Russell Price.Looks like you guys have a lot of bang-bang down here, eh? Little misunderstanding between the poets and the government?You're a helluva translator.Who is Rafael?I don't really give a damn... but the guy's got a great face.How would he like to be photographed?Wanta lay odds?Just one more thing -- is Rafael owned by the C.I.A. or the K.G.B.? I'll figure out the rest.So far this war's got it all over Africa.You still hanging in there with Claire?Younger men.Just now.What'd ya get?Who's Tacho?I don't know who the players are yet.Let me look.Well...Got Africa all wrapped up and pouched to my editor.We gotta get alone somewhere to talk.Alex is one of the world's leading experts on military strategy.Well, hell, I just got off the boat... gimme the scoop on Nicaragua...No, no, no...

Taking pictures. The usual. Jazy got me released.Ahh... C.I.A. stories are all alike. I wanta find Rafael.No. You?I figure you probably want to do a little research on the history of Marcel Jazy's business connections in the third world countries with C.I.A. influence......are you a spy or aren't you, eh?Why was I arrested, and why did you get me released, and who are you?There's a rumor about this picture. Some people say you're a genius -- that you invented this scheme.It's supposed to be nasty there... a lotta people think Rafael's in the South. I want to find out.Rafael is near Leon?I dreamed about you.Yeah... so'd you.Is the tape on?I was on the deck of the U.S.S. Pueblo catching some rays when the North Koreans attacked... took a bullet right in the chest, but by luck I had an extra roll of high speed ektachrome in this pocket right here... over the heart...You heard about it?! I was lucky.Yeah.F.8 at a sixtieth.So was I. You ever dream about me?How was I?Me too.You thinking of scoring a Toyota?C'mon. Be careful.They're away.What the fuck are you doing here?It's beautiful.You bastard!I know who shot Pedro. I knew somebody was in the tower.I don't know... then they would've killed him I guess. I didn't want to interfere.I think I made the wrong one.I didn't? I picked up a gun. Jesus. Is something happening to us?Are you asleep?G'morning.You look beautiful.'Bout ten frames. Wait'll you see the pictures -- you look great.After they're printed.I talk in my sleep?Call the office.

I'll just... be over here.I'm a personal friend of Tacho's.Don't look, huh? No mire!Ahh, I'm a chicken, don't worry. Alex, listen to me...Within a year you're gonna be one of the \"Ten Most Admired Men in America.\"But it's great P.R. So what's the upside?What's the downside?How the hell could Tacho find Rafael.Is Tacho lying again? They did kill him, didn't they?One more, please! Una mas, por favor?We help each other, right? Could you move your girlfriend into the sun...Is Rafael alive or dead?Just one more -- thank you. I thought you knew everything?Carter don't need proof. He just sent twenty-five million in new arms to Tacho. I'm sorry... almost got it here.The State Department's gonna pull the plug on Tacho?! Pardon my French -- but whose fucking side are you on?Great job.Rough ain't it. Thank you everybody, very nice.I don't think Rafael is dead. I'm gonna find him.Con permiso -- who controls what today?You can drop us off.Wrong way!Go one more block.We want out!Periodista, periodista, periodista!Yeah. If it's possible.Rafael is dead.I can smell it.He's dead. I know it.You're crazy.Yeah. Commandante... Soy un periodista.I don't do things... like this.Or when you're in bed.Not so simple.I'm not gonna take it.Do what you want to do.I want to be here. With you. What do you want.I love you.Don't think so much.What's he doing here?On what?Fabulous.Because of me?Terrific... now... I'm a little slow here, Alex... what exactly did you come back for?No way.We don't owe him anything!He wouldn't understand.I'll take Alex to find Rafael -- we'll go to Sebaco on the road to Matagalpa -- the Guardia heavily control the area and they're scared right now -- they'll never let us through. We won't be able to get near Rafael. Alex will understand -- and we'll turn around and drive back without a story.Tell me about lies!We may not be able to find him, y'know...Everybody looks good in the tropics.Alex... I love her.It's past the thinking stage.No!Yes! Alex -- we're friends!Don't worry. I put this in your name.You get paid by the body or by the hour?You didn't have to nail Pedro.Why them? Why them?!You're a cocksucker!Fuck you.Why them?She dead?Some-motherfucker-took-my-fucking- pictures-I-don't-fucking-know-what- happened! Fuck me!I developed it in my room. Jesus Christ, Alex?!It was.Algo no esta aqui. Fotografias.Negativos, negativos!Oates said it was a Frog. How many Frenchmen you know around here? Jazy ain't 'facilitating' shit.Anything.Let's get out of here.We've got to talk to Alex.This is what I want to show you.It's not Tacho. It's Mussolini. Tacho went to Italy to commission a statue of himself, he found a warehouse full of Il Duces on horseback, got a great deal on one of 'em -- brought it back and switched heads. Ya can't tell, can ya?Dead!Alex... I think I finally saw one too many bodies. Somoza is a killer. I thought the war would end sooner. How many reasons do you want?It's great stuff, isn't it? We'd go down in a blaze of glory.It's a little dangerous looking for Jazy at the moment.Damn air conditioning.C'mere.Alex... let's go back.I don't know.Just a sec'... take a flag.You fucks! You fucks!Gracias.What're you doing here?!The Guardia did it -- I got pictures.Hola. Do you control this area?You murder people.No.Nothing. He asked for directions.We gotta get outta sight -- half the fucking army's looking for me...Aw, Christ...

C'mon, we've all got something to celebrate.Go ahead.\"Well\"... you finished your assignment in Chad?You're going to love this war, Russell... there's good guys, bad guys, cheap shrimp... And Alex is still singing in the background. I missed you.Jesus... he's doing it on purpose.Well... about sixty years ago the U.S. Marines invaded to protect American business interests and put down a peasant revolt led by a little man who wore a giant cowboy hat -- his name was Augusto Sandino... In nineteen thirty-four he was murdered at a peace conference, and the Somoza family has ruled ever since...The \"real\" stuff?... you mean a history of class struggle in agrarian societies?Oh. Okay... well... Just a couple things. One -- there's only two kinds of beer available -- Tona and Victoria. Victoria's better. And two -- if you see Miss Panama hanging around the hotel bar -- hot, hot, hot -- but don't touch. She belongs to Tacho, and if anybody gets caught with her then El Presidente has promised to personally cut off the guy's...Yeah... and throw it into Lake Managua.And the lake's already polluted.No.Three Mile Island.Jesus... Louis Jordan walks in, and I'm sitting with the Everly Brothers.He's a businessman in search of a business... he doesn't try very hard to cover up his connections to the C.I.A...But look at his moves -- can the C.I.A. light cigarettes like that?I want you to get me copies of the Government inventory lists of all captured Guerrilla weapons. I want to know if the guns are Israeli, Belgian, Russian, Cuban...Fine -- give me proof.Hi, baby! How are you? Has Grandmother spoiled you silly by now? She has? Good. Yes, I got your letter with the picture of your new boyfriend. He's very good looking... but he's a bit old, isn't he? No? Just how old is he?...You throw a journalist in jail -- it gets in the papers. You walk all over the same press credentials you pass out. I demand to speak to someone in authority or I'll go to Tacho myself... I don't understand you -- you're big and strong and handsome but you're not so smart! You should be trying to seduce us!You're okay?They love being beaten up by a woman I've been looking for you all night -- why'd they lock you up?Jazy?! You think there's a story there?You need help?No. When should we start.Oh. I assumed you'd just look him in the eye and say \"Gimme a break, for crissakes, Marcel, are you a spy or aren't you?\"Russell prefers pictures to words...And you're a businessman?These are not the normal duties of a businessman.Because he thinks she's seeing another man?We're going to Masaya... they say the Rebels have hit the cuartel.We're not doing a travelogue, you understand.Don't let us stand in the way.Did you dream about Miss Panama last night?Have a good time?And old war injury flaring up?Of course.And the bullet ricocheted off the film, grazed your cheek, and saved your life.Did anyone ever die next to you in combat?What did you do?That's an old joke. My question was serious.Once.Fast.I'm basically a coward, Russell, I hope you understand that. I hope we don't get shot.I thought it was quiet here.No problem -- we leave the car.Now what?Be careful?! Where the fuck we going? Better light?...June tenth... the evacuation of Leon... a woman carries a pig... signs for the F.S.L.N. are everywhere... a body...Russell?!You're okay?Much better than Koufax.Gracias. Can they get into trouble for keeping us?What about him?!Hello sweetheart, this is your mother. I'm in Leon and I miss you. Don't worry about me -- it's not dangerous at all. I guess you can't believe what you hear on the news. I'll put this this tape in the mail when I get back to Managua, but knowing what the mail service is like, I may be home before it arrives. I think about you all the time and hope I can make it back before you graduate from Jr. High.I love you and I'll finish this letter when I get back to the hotel.Why didn't you tell the guerrillas?It wasn't an easy choice.You didn't take any pictures when it was over.Yes.No.What are you doing?How long have you been doing this?I'll bet I look great -- give me the film.I'll develop them myself -- give it to me or I'll start taping what you say in your sleep.Girl's names and F-stops. Terrible.Oh!Bloody.You haven't been here very long.About what?I like your cheekbones. Alex, are you all right?You decided to go with the network.Alex...Alex...The C.I.A.No, no, don't be ridiculous.For the moment.You're late to your own luncheon, Mr. President -- we can schedule this for another time.We are a stunning couple. Mr. President, you own one fifth of all the land in Nicaragua, you own the shipping port, the national airlines, the Mercedes dealership...Do you always hold hands with reporters?Would you care to comment on the fall of Leon to the rebels?There are reports that the Guardia operates a torture chamber at Coyotepe.Since the earthquake in 1972 destroyed half of Managua, over three hundred million dollars in foreign relief aid have poured into the country, yet nothing has been re-built. It is said that the money has gone into your pocket.Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Brazil, and Panama are reportedly on the verge of breaking off diplomatic relations with your regime. Would you comment?How do we find the guerillas?Go two or three blocks and turn right at the sniper.Then let us out.He just wanted to see credentials, for crissakes, what're doing?Si.Do you know why we're here... exactly?Rafael's tent?What is it?I don't know.What're you talking about?Then why did they bring us all the way here to see him?If Washington thinks Rafael is dead, they will ship the arms to Somoza. Do you understand.I spend my whole life separating how I feel from how I think and what I see from what I say -- that's called journalism, isn't it?It's disciplined. It civilized. It involves distinctions. I'm great at distinctions. I wish I wasn't so good at them. Sometimes I envy you -- you don't make any -- it's very convenient. The only time I don't worry about all those things is when I'm with my daughter.Yes! My job is to find a story, then tell a story -- whatever it is -- because I believe that if enough people hear enough stories then somehow, through information alone, we all have a better chance to survive. I believe in information. That's a very romantic streak I have running through me -- maybe it's a weakness. Information is good -- lack of information is bad. Simple, eh?You're God damn right it's not. You take that picture you'll take it for all the right reasons -- I understand.That's fine for you. But do I go back and say I interviewed Rafael? Do I go back and say I missed the biggest story of the war? Or do I say Rafael was stone cold dead -- that's the information, isn't it? Or do I say he entertained us all in his inimitably charismatic manner around the ol' revolutionary campfire? Can we throw up our arms and say we fell in love with the querillas because their cause was... sympathetic? Journalists don't fall in love. Which story do you want me to tell?Christ, what the fuck are we doing here?I want this war to end. I'm not going to tell the world that Rafael is dead.I think I love you.Under a steel gray July sky... start again... under a gray steel Managuan sky... scratch it... In an extraordinary development in Managua, President Anastazio Somoza has ordered the Air Force to begin bombing his own capitol, under a sky... fuck it...Oh my God...A Scotch, please... Double.I have no idea.Well, yes... it's fabulous.Why are you back?You look good. Things're okay?We've got to tell Alex what happened.I'll tell him. He deserves to know.We owe him that! He got you started in this business... he covered for your missed deadlines and made excuses for your unprofessional attitude before the world fell in love with your pictures... Before kids fresh out of journalism school were rushing off to any war they could to interview bullets and take pictures of bodies -- like Price! He took care of you before you were hot!Before Nicaragua you wouldn't understand. I'm not sure I exactly understand. What are we going to do?That's a lie!I don't want to tell him either.Commandante Cinco's body was just found on the road to Matagalpa.I don't think it's Jazy.Christ!Are we looking for negs or prints?Que quiere?No esta aqui.Una novia suya.No, no, no...Russell? Russell?You think our flags are big enough?I think what he's trying to say -- what we're trying to say -- is that things aren't exactly what they seem to be.Alex! That's not why we're here.Rafael is dead.Who cares how?!No! I wanted Rafael to be alive.I'd do it again.Anything you want.Oh Jesus.She's an officer in the Rafael army -- we saw her in Matagalpa.I wish I was home.Do you think it's almost over?Heard from Russell?Wanta help me find him?Fuck off, Hub, get outta my way.Do you know where the American journalist was killed?Have you seen him?Russell!Alex!You got caught by some boys?Yes.You picked the wrong side.You okay? Russell... what did Alex do?They're not looking for me.Let me have the film... ...if I can't get to the hotel I'll come back here...Russell... it's more dangerous being with you than being alone.That's great advice.Yes... perhaps they will.Have you seen La Guardia?I don't know.Yes.Can you help us ship it home?Did you get enough pictures?", "clean_line": "strange war features provincial

You called it a \"strange war\" and an \"endless story.\" If you filed that story for me, I'd say you were editorialishing.Drunk? Only with the memories of making love with you on the plains of Fianga as the first Army of Liberation marched in and opened fire.Right.Christ, I don't want to go to this stupid party. I'm bad at false modesty.You can work out of the East Coast. We'll get a place on Long Island and burn our suitcases.Every Saturday night we'll have a party... invite all our friends, sit out on the veranda and interview each other.I haven't. Well, God dammit, I'm getting tired of memorizing who's the president of the... Republic of Maldives.Yeah, he succeeded Mamoon Abdul Gayeem.And I'm tired of Third World elevators.Don't leave me.Fuck Abou Deia and New York. I'm going to Nicaragua with you.I've heard it's a neat little war with a nice hotel.You may be asking yourself what exactly are you doing here in this \"strange war, just another chapter in an endless story... that grinds into its seventh year...\"Welcome to Managua.Well... I thought of calling your photographs \"Pictures from a Lost War\"... I'm great at captions -- the New York editors loved it since none of them knew where the hell Chad was anyway -- it legitimized their ignorance, got you a cover, me a feature, and packaged a class struggle in two words. Nifty, eh?I'm sorry... this is Isela Cruz. She works for the hotel and helps out as a translator.My Spanish is a little out of shape -- what'd he say?Russell's got a way with words.It depends who you ask.You're gonna have a ball.Hands off. I need an interpreter more than you do right now.I'm hanging in there like an interim post-war government waiting for the palace to be overrun... by younger men.Congratulations. The bastard won't talk to me.Want me to order you a hot dog and a program?There's not many piano bars left where I'm still welcome.If she can't sing in the key of C I'm in trouble.Sometimes I wonder why I spend these lonely nights, Dreaming of a song...Tell him we have pictures.Tell him there were pieces of body in the piano, and somebody was singing, \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco.\" What's he got better than that?Forget the Pope, Charlie. Every week you got the Pope somewhere. This is a very big story down here because it's the first sign of fighting in Managua. Yeah, well get a map and look up Nicaragua -- ya drive to New Orleans and turn left.Like hell I'm editorializing, the whole thing happened in a roomful of C.I.A. and press. What do you want?! How do I know they were C.I.A.? They wore name tags, what do you think? We're backing a Fascist again -- I know that ain't news, but see if you can find an angle!We don't have any pictures of Rafael because nobody knows where the son of a bitch is, and anybody crazy enough to go after him......is liable to get his nuts shot off.Yeah, well g'bye... Who the fuck are you?Who?How was Matagalpa?You find anything?Oh. How was Leon?Yeah... I'll bet... Claire...I'm tired of Nicaragua.Long enough, lets face it, you were right... everybody was right.My cheekbones. What do you think of 'em?This is a face made for television.Is he a good fuck?That's a reasonable question for a reporter to ask, isn't it?! I shoulda never come down here, eh? This is the way it's going to be. I'll make a shitload of money in television for just sitting there. I'm gonna show up to work at Rockefeller Center every morning and they're gonna hand me the news with my coffee and toast. I shoulda never come down here, eh? This war down here belongs to you guys, okay? I'm on tommorrow's plane.You want to take me to the airport? It's okay. I shoulda never come down here.Take this to check in. I'll be right there.Jesus, where'd you get this?Where else.We're grownups, Russell... Most of us.No happy snaps.You're sure about him?Don't get hurt.Yeah?Congratulations.On what?! The Washington Post, the Times, networks, wire services -- everybody's picked up the picture. It's fabulous.I came back because of Russell.Yeah... the whole fucking East Coast is falling in love with Rafael -- they were sure he was dead this time. Somebody wants to do a musical about him and his mug's on every T-shirt in Central Park.I think he's bigger than Farrah Fawcett.I'm happier in New York, sure, things are great. You guys?It's a great story. I want to talk to Rafael... and you're the only man in the world that can take me to him.I've got supreme confidence in you.Claire looks good, eh?Since I haven't been able to find Isela since coming back, you're going to have to translate for me -- what the hell does that mean?And she 'thinks' she loves you.I'd like to know something -- it probably doesn't matter in the great final scheme of things... but I'm interested... Did you ever lay a hand on her before she left me?That's the truth?I bet you go through a few rental cars.Oh my God...Russell, let's get outta here.Who gives you the pictures?Off the record.Didn't you ship the film to New York?Slow down. It wasn't your fault if somebody stole your stuff...What about Rafael?We drove through three roadblocks a half hour before curfew so you could show me a statue of Tacho.What the hell are you talking about?Well, they don't \"seem\" to be that great so I can't wait for this one... Hey, here we are! Two guys in the tropics in love with the same dame... bullets flying!Oh yeah? I left the country because of him... ...and I came back because of him... And now the cutest couple in town has me looking up a horse's ass on a midnight tour of Managua. What are we doing here?In the picture he's dead?How the hell...You saw too many bodies? That's a lot of bodies. You stupid son of a bitch. Did he talk you into it?In some way I understand him doing it, I don't like it but I understand... but you?You two have, of course, just served me up your balls -- if that's what they're called -- on a platter. I can bury you both. You're handing me your careers.Well, Jesus Christ... this is a motherfucking story, Russell... What am I supposed to do with it?They're holding the lead in the World section for Rafael.Oh yeah... I don't know what to do. I've gotta take some kind of a story back with me. Maybe Jazy, eh?Ah, danger -- I love it. You could ask the pointy-shoed little bastard about your pictures... and I could ask him whatever happened to Isela.You mean I slept with a Sandinista?I guess Rafael is alive, eh?Jazy's probably sitting in the bar laughing at us. Which way's the hotel?I'll ask her... be right back.", "clean_line": "party ll late called strange war endless story filed story editorialishing drunk memories making love plains fianga army liberation marched opened right christ want stupid party bad false modesty work east coast ll place long island burn suitcases saturday night ll party invite friends sit veranda interview haven god dammit getting tired memorizing president republic maldives yeah succeeded mamoon abdul gayeem tired world elevators leave fuck abou deia new york going nicaragua ve heard neat little war nice hotel asking exactly strange war chapter endless story grinds seventh year welcome managua thought calling photographs pictures lost war great captions new york editors loved knew hell chad legitimized ignorance got cover feature packaged class struggle words nifty eh sorry isela cruz works hotel helps translator spanish little shape russell got way words depends ask gonna ball hands need interpreter right hanging like interim post war government waiting palace overrun younger men congratulations bastard won talk want order hot dog program piano bars left welcome sing key trouble wonder spend lonely nights dreaming song tell pictures tell pieces body piano somebody singing left heart san francisco got better forget pope charlie week got pope big story sign fighting managua yeah map look nicaragua ya drive new orleans turn left like hell editorializing thing happened roomful press want know wore tags think backing fascist know ain news angle pictures rafael knows son bitch anybody crazy liable nuts shot yeah bye fuck matagalpa oh leon yeah ll bet claire tired nicaragua long lets face right everybody right cheekbones think em face television good fuck reasonable question reporter ask isn shoulda come eh way going ll shitload money television sitting gonna work rockefeller center morning gonna hand news coffee toast shoulda come eh war belongs guys okay tommorrow plane want airport okay shoulda come check ll right jesus grownups russell happy snaps sure hurt yeah congratulations washington post times networks wire services everybody picked picture fabulous came russell yeah fucking east coast falling love rafael sure dead time somebody wants musical mug shirt central park think bigger farrah fawcett happier new york sure things great guys great story want talk rafael man world ve got supreme confidence claire looks good eh haven able isela coming going translate hell mean thinks loves like know probably matter great final scheme things interested lay hand left truth bet rental cars oh god russell let outta gives pictures record ship film new york slow wasn fault somebody stole stuff rafael drove roadblocks half hour curfew statue tacho hell talking great wait hey guys tropics love dame bullets flying oh yeah left country came cutest couple town looking horse ass midnight tour managua picture dead hell saw bodies lot bodies stupid son bitch talk way understand like understand course served balls called platter bury handing careers jesus christ motherfucking story russell supposed holding lead world section rafael oh yeah know ve gotta kind story maybe jazy eh ah danger love ask pointy shoed little bastard pictures ask happened isela mean slept sandinista guess rafael alive eh jazy probably sitting bar laughing way hotel ll ask right"}}}
