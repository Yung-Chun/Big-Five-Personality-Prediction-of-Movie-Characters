{"City-of-Joy": {"HASARI": {"raw_line": "I'll send money soon. His Mother nods, as Hasari erupts in a small cough which, by habit, he suppresses. His Mother crushes Aloka to her.Scared? No -- why? This is very exciting. As soon as we get to our friend's house, everything will be fine. But, despite Hasari's charade of confidence, they are overwhelmed by the size of the station and the desperate energy of the humanity around them. As they press on, a small beggar woman huddled on the platform turns her eyes eerily on Manooj... as a deformed hand stretches INTO the FRAME. Aloka senses someone: A beggar, face half-hidden and eaten away by leprosy. This terrifying image presses the boys tightly to their mother and moves Hasari to encircle Armita with one hand and attempt to wrap the other three inside the embrace of his other hand. It does not seem possible that he can protect all of them against the predatory eyes watching them. He moves them quickly to a wall...Wait right here. Don't move.Please, can you direct me to my friend at this address? We are to stay with him. The Vendor gives the address a look, shows it to the Vendor next to him. Both look at Hasari. VENDOR #1 There's no such address as this in Calcutta.But that's not possible. VENDOR #1 Of course it is possible! I have lived here all my life. You are new. Who would know if a place exists or does not? VENDOR #2 Bombay, perhaps. Delhi. Look there.Manooj, go and get some fruit. Come straight back. Delighted with his task, Manooj sets off, his eyes on the marquee of the theater with its huge cardboard cutout of Kumar Kapur, starring in Hot Gun. Hasari calls out to him to watch where he's going; the mere crossing of the street is a potential parental nightmare. A hand ruffles Manooj's head and a TALL MAN with dark eyes and a sweet smile comes at the boy's anxious parents.Yes, how did you know?Three years without rain. Nothing came out of the earth but debts.I have only seventy-five, but as soon as I have work...My name is Pal, Hasari. Mr. Gangooly rented this space to --Gangooly. You must be his cousin, Mr. Moti.But this is true. We paid him a deposit of fifty --Don't let it frighten you. You have to be brave. I know we'll find work today. Fear and doubt fill Manooj's eyes. He nods.What man? Why -- did you ask him for money?Where is he? Shambu looks, but the car's gone.Don't do that. We're not beggars. Shambu is devastated. Out of his own desperation, Hasari feels he's been a little rough on the boy. He holds him close.Go back to the river. Wait for me by the tree. Don't go anywhere. Do you understand? Aloka, the boys nod. We WATCH them as Hasari heads off, quickly becoming a small figure disappearing into the sea.Yes, yes of course. But I'm three days without work. I'll take anything. The Clerk digs in his pocket, presses two rupees on Hasari.No, I don't want you to give me -- The next man in line forcibly moves Hasari out of the way.My wife, my children... Hasari rushes on. Suddenly we -- CUT TO:I told you to remain where I left you! I told you to stay there!I would be proud if you would share our food with us. Everyone looks at the food; there is no disguising their hunger.What? She doesn't want to say it, doesn't want to wake the children.It's all right -- what?No! Today, I'm just a mangy dog on the street, but soon, I swear, I'll look other men in the eye! I swear. Yet on his face we see the extraordinary pressure to make this promise reality.I thought you were only taking a little.I'm feeling a little dizzy.What are those?It sounds like someone needs help. Hasari bolts for the corner.What are you doing? A man's being beaten here! As Hasari runs down the alley, the MOTORCYCLE FIRES UP and SCREAMS OFF and the three goons take flight.No, please. Max finds his pockets empty. Then reaches for his wrist -- his watch is gone -- and then his throat -- his chai is gone, too.You see, I can keep up.I can do it. I could pull it.Oh yes, Babu. Can I... uhm...?Well, yes, Babu, I can do that. Would you like me to imitate a horse? Finished with the pimple, Ashoka wipes a finger on his shirt and takes a helping off a plate of sweetcakes as...I have a wife and three children, Babu.I shall be eternally grateful to you. From now on, I shall be as the youngest of your brothers.Someone has blessed us. A job, a roof, a school. Soon I'll be able to send money home... ... and put away a little bit for your dowry. In their excitement, the boys run.I'm sorry, I don't know where that is. You're my very first passenger.Yes, thank you, you can depend on me. The girl runs into the school yard, met immediately by friends. Hasari looks around at the clean, bustling school, at all the children in their crisp uniforms and a look of great yearning comes over his face.So we can watch something grow.Amrita, I saw a beautiful wedding sari today. Amrita is terribly embarrassed.If you have it.That's very generous but no, thank you.You have repaid me by sharing our supper.I can run and get Dr. Sunil.You're a doctor, how can you not help?I think perhaps you are a good man. Hasari brings his hands together and goes inside.I'm sorry, forgive me. It won't happen again.Oh, I am so pleased for you! Panting helplessly, Hasari smiles... as he helps the School Girl's Mother into the rickshaw.Good morning, missus. Briskly, he takes up the shafts and sets off.It's farther that way, missus.I was just...Yes, Babu.It's more than a father could hope.From the godfather's son. For you and the doctor. Amidst instant concern, Joan opens the envelope. Looks at Max. We hear the sound of BANGLADESH MUSIC.The Godfather.The Godfather.Is it permitted to speak? There are quick nods around the room. With great difficulty, Hasari says his piece.I want my children to be educated and cared for; this is our home, we have never had such friends. But many of us owe a great debt to the Godfather. He is strong and could kill us... But we must choose. I trust my Big Brother. I say we must stand up. There's still dissension, but somewhat more support. Said makes a fierce, unintelligible supportive sound. Surya sighs again. Eyes flick at the old man.Yes.No, please, get in. Max climbs into the rickshaw beside the two lepers and Hasari pulls away.I told them that your father provides us with a great deal and that -- Ashoka slams his hand on the register.Please, Babu, this is as if the ground has opened up. I have to speak to Mr. Ghatak! Hasari starts for the house. The Goonda stops him and, quickly, has Hasari on his knees, his arm twisted pain- fully behind his back. Ashoka jumps at Hasari, grabs his ear.I have a family!They took away my rickshaw. Aloka's hand flies to her mouth. Hasari peers at Max with his drunken gaze. It's a terrible moment for Max, but...But I trusted you.I don't know how I'm going to pay the rent, how we're going to eat.The children must leave the school; they'll have to work. And you will not have anything to do with the clinic or those people anymore. Ram joins them.You can't support all of us. You have a family in your village, too. Hasari touches his friend and goes into:Take more. The Attendant shakes his head.Take more. The Attendant looks at Rafik, who shrugs, nods... and allows the blood to flow on out of Hasari's body.Still stealing from refugees? Gangooly looks at Hasari, recognizes him, and gives him an amazing smile.I'm touched.I lost my rickshaw. Gangooly gives Hasari an appraising look for a moment, then...Which, fortunately, it is.It's not a question of money. We'll survive on our own. That's it. Hasari lies with his back to Max. After some moments of silence, Aloka indicates Max should go. And he does. After another moment...No! I'm your husband and you'll do as I say! Unless, of course, you've become an American wife and then you'll do as you please!Stay away from them. They are not part of us. They will only be good to you as long as you please them. The children, Aloka are frozen, she very close to tears. Hasari lies back down, again turns his back on them.If I were to go on the street with this machine, I would end up in a gutter with my throat cut.Doctor Daddah, I'm just a small man. Don't try to tempt me again with big thoughts. Hasari starts to leave. Max blocks his way.But can you be trusted?Close the door! Max is very surprised but, needless to say, pleased. He looks at the rickshaw, looks at Hasari.Close the door. The Godfather has more eyes than a pineapple.I was saying to Manooj that if a man bows down too many times, there will come a day when he will no longer be able to stand upright. The two men look at each other... and then Hasari gets on with his work.If a man makes a promise... Max brins his hands together and starts for the door. Hasari picks up one of the worn seat boards.You're my wife, Aloka, you and my children are all my wealth. But if Max Daddah and Big Sister Joan have need of you, you may go to them. Max comes out of the hospital. The two Pals stare at him.Max Daddah is our friend. If they're trying to harm him, then they're trying to harm all of us. We must stand by him as one.I'm going on the streets tomorrow. This gets everyone's attention. The pullers shake their heads, they're worried for him.I'm going to speak to his father.Babu, please, I beg you, hear my words! As the Goonda is about to land on Hasari we hear a feeble...May I say first, Babu, I wish you long life and good health.When you gave me work, I swore I would be as your youngest brother. Your son thinks I have been disloyal. He took my rickshaw. With my friend, I have remade this one. I beg you to let me go again onto the streets. I have my family. The old man looks at the rickshaw, at the obvious care that went into its renovation, at this unlikely team of refurbishers. He reaches a shaking hand out toward a shaft. Hasari brings it close. The old man rubs the shaft.Thank you, Babu.An allure, Babu -- thank you. The Godfather stares at Hasari, then at Max.If a man dies and he's not burned, what do you think becomes of his soul? The manager turns his palms up, continues chewing. Hasari stares through the window at the row of skeletons.I must provide for my family.What's going on?Friends! The Godfather at least is a caring man! This one, though, the son -- A signal from Ashoka and one of the thugs knocks Hasari down.Friends -- don't! If we stand -- He gets hit again. A number of the pullers come forward and a riot starts. The police move in, beat and arrest many of the demonstrators. Ramatullah and Chomotkar try to help Hasari, but they are descended on by cops who hurl them aside and beat Hasari senseless until the: SCREEN GOES BLACK.The life of a rickshaw puller is not one a man would choose if he had a choice. Our feet blister and burn up from the boiling asphalt, our noses burn from the fumes of countless motor cars and buses, our backs curve permanently from the loads we carry hour after hour, day after day. But I am proud to be one of the human horses who carry my countryman from place to place and I am thankful for the opportunity to make a living. But I will not keep silent anymore and I will not be cheated and threatened anymore. Life is hard enough. No more. Ramatullah starts to applaud. Rassoul follows suit. The Judge bangs his gavel.Fifty rupees, Your Honor? That's --Really -- a boyfriend, Amrita?Is there someone you care about? The look in Amrita's eyes tells us indeed there is. Hasari smiles at Amrita and then at Aloka.Then I must speak to his father and I must complete your dowry. Amrita squeezes close to her mother. This is serious and joyous.You will make people sigh at how beautiful you are. And I shall drop tears of joy.The monsoon is the great Durga's gift to the human horse! Hasari glances at Ram, who isn't a part of the joking.What's the matter?Eight rupees. MARWARI #4 What! I won't pay it!Who else needs a ride? I am available at a price!The price just went up! Ten rupees! In advance. The Marwari hesitates only as long as it takes him to dig in his soaking wet pants and to slap the bills into Hasari's hand and climb aboard. Hasari sets out with great difficulty -- and greater determination -- through the floodwaters, flicking his eyes at the Goonda as he goes.How can I help?Here! I'm here!Yes, that's correct. He looks at his brothers, on either side. They look at him.Yes, yes, I was, my daughter told me, thank you.It's too deep!I can offer no more than I've offered! No more! All right, I'll add two dhotis, two vests, and a punjabi. But that's all. Mr. Ghosh lights up a bidi, looks at his brothers, wrinkles his brows at Hasari.My daughter's qualities will make up for what is lacking.That's robbery! The child of a rajah might be worth that, and I'm not even sure of that! Impossible! We linger on Shambu a moment.Get back! Stay back!Please, don't touch her, Babu.I said, Please, don't touch her. Hasari glances over his shoulder, his eyes bouncing off the Goonda's impassive face. Now, the knife comes out of Ashoka's pocket, snaps open, glints in the light.Life is hard enough. No more. Leave us alone. Hasari backs off, leans against a wall, stares down at Ashoka, his hands in tight against his body. Manooj and Shambu stare at their father in awe. Shambu sees something on the ground where the first blow was delivered to Ashoka's chest. Everyone has moved slightly to one side. He bends and closes his fist around something. The Goonda steps between Ashoka and Max and Hasari.A man's journey to the end of his obligations is a very long road. And you have to remember that you can never give up. We pray that life will bless us, that we will be kings, with possessions and money that we can rule over all around us. But it's a mist; the only thing that makes it possible to endure life is our love, one for the other. A beat, the family and Max tightly bound together. And now we hear the dim sounds of RICKSHAW BELLS.I was dreaming the sound of rickshaw bells, and now I hear them. Max opens the windows. Manooj helps his father sit up.Are they here for me? Unquestionably, they are.A city so big. When we arrived, we didn't have a place to live, a friend. He smiles.Get serious! I've agreed to the bicycle, I've agreed to the 1000 rupees! I can go no further. I have nothing more to give!You never did belong to me. You were only lent to me by God until you marry and continue the wheel of life. Amrita stares at her loving father and slowly her arms come up around his neck, the flower against his curved back. Tears fill Hasari's eyes, but a smile graces his lips.I would be pleased if you would stand with me in the place of honor to the right of my daughter.", "clean_line": "ll send money soon mother nods

Around him, other single eyes pop open, searching for the source of this unmeditative sound. Max nods and smiles a wry smile as if to say: This just ain't doin' it for me, folks.Only what they promise in the brochure: Inner peace, serenity, and a nice chant that gets rid of this rock in my gut. E.S.T., they do you in a weekend.Impossible to predict, Betsy Ilene Kahn. Maybe you better give me my ticket.I think only you can answer that, Betsy Ilene Kahn. She slaps him.Do you really think that's an appropriate way to get rid of your Western rage, Bets? She swings at him again. He catches her hand hard in his fist.One slap is romantic. Two would call for retaliation... Lend me a hundred dollars. She yanks free, begins to chant her mantra as he grabs his knapsack and valise and goes out the door. Now, she's silent and, in the simplest sense, deeply hurt. She can't help herself; she cares. We STAY WITH her a moment as we -- DISSOLVE TO:How you doin'? The Clerk gives Max a warm smile.I've always wanted to walk into a little airport just about like this one and ask the guy at the counter the following question. Ready?When's the next flight to anywhere?I'm wanting to go wherever you're wanting to take me.Unattached trumpet player and recently-certified associate guru. As he takes a hit on the flask, Max's eye focuses on the little mirror on the dash. In it he can see Manubai's eyes. If we were to judge by what he sees in them, she doesn't find him the least bit amusing. He smiles his smile at her.He lies down on the bed. He's found Nirvana.I'm starving. He gives her his best saint's smile.You sure I look all right? The little boy nods. Max slips him several rupees... and he, Manubai, and Ravi fold themselves into her tiny car as --I said you have three days to get me into bed, and I'm betting you can't do it.Well, gee, I don't know. Maybe I could say something so amusing that you'd laugh so hard it would break that hot poker you have up your ass. She stares at him. He bends to kiss her. She doesn't pull away... but after a moment he realizes she isn't responding. He continues the kiss, but he opens his eyes... to find her staring at him. He pulls back. They stare at each other another moment, then Max senses someone in the doorway.The same sound of frustration and ennui he made in the ashram.No fruit basket? No mini bar? Max hands the Porter several rupees.They're in the shotgun. There's the snap from center, the clock is running -- five, four, three -- he has an open man at the Notre Dame twenty for the victory... and he freezes. He freezes! Mr. Choke chokes. The fans go -- A KNOCK at the door. Max shuts up, falls off the wall. He crosses to the door. Opens it. POOMINA is 16, beautiful and exotic-looking behind her excessive makeup.Got an I.D. on you? How old are you?I buy that. She approaches him seductively.Hold it, time out. Time, there's time out on the field.Is problems, yeah, just a couple.How 'bout some chow? I was just about to order some room service. Food. I call, they come, we eat. She stares at him. INT. MAX'S ROOM - NIGHT Max smokes a Monte Cristo and watches Poomina, like a frightened little animal, devour the last of a Green Acres room service meal and then wrap a small piece of fish in the paper napkin.Watching you eat was my great pleasure. Now you go home. As he escorts her toward the door, Poomina is distressed. Max realizes she can't leave empty-handed. He pulls out some notes.For you. She hasn't given up, though, and as he takes the money, she stands on tiptoe and kisses him. Torn, Max begins to respond. He stops himself, his grip on her causing her discomfort. His breath comes in little bursts.You're a very wet kisser. Work on it, get in touch in five years. He leads her toward the door. Like some lunatic comedy. she resists. He pushes. She locks her knees. He opens the door.Goddamn it, cut it out! Now, good night. He muscles her out the door, closes it, wipes his lips. He stares at a parade of cockroaches gliding along the wall as he listens to her CRYING quietly on the other side of the door. He debates... and he loses. Opens the door. Poomina stands there; the tears stop and a lip- twitching smile lights her face.Five years already? Gee, time really flies when you have no moral conviction. She slides into his arms, pressing against him. With his shoulder, he closes the door, leaving us outside.Short guys! Quit lookin' at us! This remark goes over big with the thugs. Max doesn't care. He knocks off the last of the beer in his bottle. The bartender brings them two shots of something in two unmatched glasses.For you, I would drink battery acid.I really don't think so -- oh no, nay, nay! I never lose the truly irrelevant contest.Well well. Seek punishment and ye shall find. Knowing what's coming, Max nevertheless unleashes a beautiful howl and tries to trample The Goonda off- tackle. From behind, he's hit with a length of stick. He goes down, looks up through blasted eyes at Ashoka as two sticks now land against his shoulder and his head...Oh, I like the way the room moves in circles. I suppose I should inquire where I am.Is that geographic or spiritual?Did I do that to your nose? I'm sorry.What was that -- a Shetland pony?Thanks -- got it. He ducks outside for some air.Pardon the expression, but Jesus H. Christ. From the tea shop, SURYA, a stout old Hindu man dressed in Western clothes, raises a hand in greeting to Joan. On the door Max and Joan have come through: \"City of Joy Self Help School & Clinic.\" Across the way, a young man is dandling a baby on his knee, rubbing its back and sniffing at its neck. Small group of children around a blackboard with a teacher, MARGARETA, doing numbers. RAM CHANDAR, the rickshaw puller, readies to go out to work. Trying to orient himself, Max turns...You a doctor?This is obviously one of those three days.I came to find my white light.Kept opening the doors and windows of my spirit, but couldn't see a goddamn thing.I suppose that depends how you define the word: I'm a doctor.Forget it. You've got your non- practicing Catholics. I'm a non- practicing doctor.Found out I just really don't like sick people. Well, I'm outta here. I owe you one.Thank you very much. Let me... He goes for his money.Come on, give him a shot. He's as fast as you and looks twice as strong.Absolutely. I trust the man. Suddenly, Ram comes to a stop.I hope you're taking something for that. Ram waves him off as Hasari lifts the shafts to his hips.I say he can do it. I'll bet you the fare he can do it. What do you think, rickshaw fans, can he do it? The crowd isn't in for fun. Hasari strains forward. The rickshaw moves with him. Ram moves alongside, shouting instructions and oaths. A cop comes on the run, screaming at Hasai... which makes Ram importune more strongly and Max joke more vociferously. Even under this incredible pressue, Hasari gains confidence and begins to move quicker, earning shouts of approval from Max and Ram, who now has trouble keeping up as they make their way through the maelstrom, an avalanche of oaths following them.Beef. You know -- cow? Minced, little salt, pepper, slap it flat like this, throw it on the grill, flip it. Now, though, he just glimpses the shiny gas tank and engine of a motorcycle around the hip of the waiter. He leans out.You know, I have to say you really don't look Jewish. I believe that's mine.Really? Max grabs Ashoka... who breaks free, and GUNS the CYCLE down a side street. Max gives chase, his aching ribs slowing him a bit.Oh... great... good...good timing ...him!Passport? I'm in the middle of a high speed chase. That guy --It's in my hotel room.Ready my lips: I do not have my passport with me at this... Ah, I see, said the blind man. The Cop obviously is doing this at Ashoka's behest. Max starts around the Cop. The Cop, however, sticks his club in Max's face; there's fire in Max's eyes... but a hand takes the Cop's stick before Max can make a big mistake.It's got to be like trying to drill a hole in water, though.Nope, no, earthly idea. You're pretty much outta my league, thought-wise.Only three -- okay. And what are they?Has it occurred to you that this obsession with charity is really a flaw in your character?One of us sure as hell is. The clinic's part-time doctor, SUNIL DASGUPTA, comes out of the clinic after a very long day.The same.No, I'm the visiting American soccer star, El Max.When I was your age -- two movies, plus cartoons every Saturday. Aloka and Amrita are cooking on an open fire bucket. Max almost knocks the fire over. Aloka looks at him, apolo- getic, shy... as Manooj knocks Shambu down at Max's feet. Max scoops the little boy up...There you go, little guy. Ut -- what's this? Reaching behind Shambu's ear, Max produces a boiled sweet. Aloka watches this with a smile; their eyes touch again... as Manooj lets out a cry at the sight of their father.That's only 40 dollars, isn't it?I'll send it to you from America when I get home tomorrow.Repayment for punching you in the nose.I don't have a cent on me. I'll owe you.I don't have any experience with leprosy.Pull me two c.c.'s of Coramine. He nods at Aloka; she illuminates the scene.Uh-oh, uh-oh, who's this coming' down the lane? Why it's -- is it possible -- way over here, in India -- yes, it's Mr. Choke. He comes to a stop. Everyone stares at him. Meeta moans. For a moment, he stays frozen. Aloka reaches out instinctively, wipes the sweat from his eyes. This gesture seems to free him; he looks at her, looks at the room and its expectant, trusting faces...I'm going to have to turn it -- the baby. Tell her she has to relax these muscles as much as she can. He doesn't finish the sentence. Aloka speaks softly to Meeta as Max takes Meeta's arm, makes a tourniquet. Joan hands him the syringe and he injects. Hands the syringe back to Joan and begins to work at turning the baby. Aloka takes Meeta's hand and it's a moment before we realize Aloka, with her fine hand, is holding Meeta's fingerless palm.Tell her again to breathe in short little bursts now. He demonstrates. Aloka does the same to Meeta. Meeta tries to cooperate. And suddenly Max has the baby turned.All right! Now, tell her to push. Aloka translates. Meeta pushes. The midwife, the little girl, Aloka lean forward.Again. Yes! Again. It's coming.We've got it, we've got it. Yeah!Never been so scared in my life. It's a warm, open moment between them. But now there's the ongoing desperation of her needs.Can't do it. Maybe you've got it in you to be a saint. I just don't.You could make a helluva nurse. A little smile comes over her face; no one's ever paid her that kind of compliment. She goes into Ram's hut, leaving Max and Hasari now.listens.But I want to go home with you.Yes.Good -- how -- name it.I would love to do that, Betsy Ilene, boy would I love to do just that, but I'm financially embarrassed at the --What credit cards? You know I maxed them before we left. Just lend me --They're calling our flight. I want to go home with you, Betsy Ilene Kahn. Because I have a vision. It's... He's trying to woo and charm her. He mimes a kind of house shape.I see you and me, Betsy Ilene Kahn, nibbling toward each other through a quarter pounder with cheese, chugalugging a frosty light beer -- great taste! Less filling! Bowling! I want to go bowling, Besty Ilene Kahn! He fires a strike through the watching crowd.I want... Oh, my Lord Amighty, I want so many American things --Isn't that your name?What should I call you? My girl, my significant other --You do -- so what?How could I possibly not understand a conversation as easy as this one, Betsy Ilene.Na ya don't.I know.You did.Will you at least call my mother and ask her to empty my savings account and wire --Guerilla theater, folks. 'All the world's a stage.' Don't know if that word reached you here yet. If you'd care to show your appreciation by a small donation... Many smiles... and several instant offers of rupees. A beat, then...Aw, what the hell. ... Swallowing his incredible embarrassment, Max takes the money.Okay, for starters, pick me out someone with something easy I can heal, make me look good. Aloka, you're my assistant, let's go. Aloka smiles, she nods, she accepts.I changed my mind.Okay, so I got left.Two weeks -- or until Mom sends me a ticket.No way. Six weeks -- and that's my best offer.Done.Thanks -- got it. The children titter. The teacher, Margareta, admonishes them to pay attention and be polite... as we --He's just malnourished. Is she giving him the milk we gave her or selling it? Aloka asks Meeta in Hindi. Meeta clearly swears she's giving the baby the milk. Aloka pushes her.Tell her to give all the milk to the baby.Psst. She looks at him.It's okay.Good night, Sunil.Wish I could, Selima, because I'm sure hungry! Sixteen hours of pestilence and misery always make me famished. I have to go with my man Anouar tonight. I've got lepers to heal!You're not tired, are you?Fifteen years from now: Miami, Florida, Dr. Manooj Pal, in association with Dr. Maxwell Loeb. For a moment, Hasari is swept up in this little reverie, then remembers reality.Am I stupid, but isn't this protection money money we're paying you to protect us from you?And how are we threatening your miracle?Well, I can't say I've developed a craving for it yet.I like your taste in neckwear. Joan puts a cautioning hand on Max's arm. Ashoka seems just the slight bit uneasy dealing with Max and so keeps trying to direct himself to Joan. He smokes a long Indian cigarette.I think I see a solution. May I? What if we were to work out a profit-sharing arrangement? We give you a share of our net profit.Beats the hell outta me, asshole. But you've obviously found a way. The question would seem to be whether Ashoka will have Max killed here or outside the house. His eyes on Max, Ashoka puts the cigarette out against the back of his hand... and smiles at Max.I don't think so... but with me, any duplicity is possible.How the hell do you proceed with caution against these people? You can't. You have to risk everything.You try to negotiate with these people, you make compromises with them, they'll eat you alive. Stand up against them now and they'll fold. I guarantee it. Underneath, they're cowards, they got no guts. We show them we're strong and the'll just move on to easier pickings.I'm not wrong. You bow your heads, you plead with your Gods to do what you won't do yourselves. You put up with this nightmare as if there were no choice. I'm telling you, if you don't stand up to that little pimple face now, he'll own you for the rest of your lives. Everyone stares at him. Many of them want to buy his commitment. There's another large sigh from Surya. Aloka and Hasari's eyes bang off of each other, she silently urging him to speak. He's deeply conflicted and deeply frightened.Okay -- shott.\"Irrigation\"?Well?What would you like to say to your wife?On no! Lepers! Lepers in my neighborhood!Oh, oh, I didn't get the concept -- of course, not lepers. I think you're going to fool a lot of people. I have only one question: Why are you here?Na, I'll just trot alongside Hasari.You're incorrigible, Anouar.The mistake's yours, putz. Get these people inside. Aloka starts forward, leading the lepers. She's stopped by a sudden blow from the Goonda's stick across her shoulders, knocking her to the ground, bleeding from the neck. Hasari bolts for his wife, gets caught up in the melee. Max swings around on the Goonda and for the first time we realize how strong he is, and that he knows how to box. The Goonda goes down and violence erupts. Anouar is chopping at the legs of one of the thugs working on Said. The massive Said tears free and starts to beat the crap out of the two thugs holding him. The noise brings everyone out of the square, those lined up at the clinic, the children from the school. Sunil comes flying out of the clinic. A stampede of those waiting outside the dispensary and those normally in the crowded alley ensues. Shanta runs inside for help. Shopkeepers barricade their shop windows. One of the thugs pours gasoline over Anouar and lights a match. Hasari kneels beside Aloka when he sees the match ignite the tiny leper. Without thinking, Hasari hurls himself on top of Anouar, rolling him in the dirt and against his own body to put out the flames. Joan shouts, demanding the violence stop. She's hit from behind; she decides talk isn't going to do it. She grabs a piece of lumber and starts to fight.Oh, little girl, little girl... Joan is suddenly beside Ashoka.If she's very careful and doesn't do anything to open the wound, the scarring will be minimal. Do you understand? You can't... You have to stay here. You make her stay here.Don't goddamn try, Joan! Goddamn do it! Poomina peers through her pain at Max, his hands putting her back together.I hate this place, I hate this place, I hate this place. Max looks at the doorway and he locks eyes with Hasari. Max breaks the contact. Hasari stares at him as we hear the godfather's MUSIC on the RADIO.I just don't... I don't want to... I don't want to care! I don't want to care this much! I just don't want to be invested in you people. In people! I became a goddamn doctor because my goddamn father wanted me to be a goddamn doctor because he was a goddamn doctor! He was the goddamn king of doctors! It's too goddamn hard! Out of breath, out of words, Joan reaches out and takes Max to her, brings him beside her on the cot. Beneath the \"Raft of Medusa,\" she sits with an arm around Max, as if he were her son.I didn't do the best I could! I did what I always do! I shot my big mouth off and did a half-assed job. And what I want to do now is I want to go back to America and make money and live a life without entanglements and demands and people hanging on me.Got it: To run, to spectate, to commit. Running spectator.So what do you want me to do about it -- get it back for you? Max takes away a step. Stops.I'm sorry. I'm going home. Because this isn't my fight. I got one person to look after -- me. Hasari stares at Max. On the roof, the children listen. At the tea shop, the late-night talkers listen.All right, I'm running out, okay? Because I'm a coward, this is me, this is what I do, I get in over my head, I let people down, I run.Well, that was your goddamn mistake! Max walks away, leaving Hasari desolate. Aloka comes to him.This is for Poomina. When I get home... He thrusts the money on Joan and Max offers his hand; she goes through the hand to embrace Max. Then Max and Aloka look at each other.What were those three choices again? Their faces. And his with just a wistful version of his old grin... and we -- FADE OUT. FADE IN: EXT. COMPOUND - DAY Hasari returns. Goes into Ram's hut.I need Aloka at the clinic. All right, they, the patients, need her. She's a good nurse. Come on, man, this is between you and me. Why take the kids out of school, why punish your wife? Hasari holds his anger in; he moves to a mat and lies down, his back to Max. But Max doesn't go.I have a little money, I can get it from the States...Hand me the scissors, please. Helpfully Said hands him the tweezers.Scissors, scissors. He demonstrates. Said fumbles through the instruments, picking up the scissors by the ends.Not that end -- No, that's fine, thanks, I've got it.You didn't steal this.How much?I'd like to show you something. Just take a minute. A beat as Hasari fixes Max with an empty stare and the family waits to see if Hasari will respond.Go ahead. Go on.I'm good with my hands. You're good with yours. What do you say? Hasari looks at Max, part resentful, part touched.Well, it's yours if you want it. You know the license, the cops, all that can be fixed. You'll own this -- it'll have nothing to do with the Godfather.You didn't want me to quit. Well, I came back.I hope so. Hasari can see the hope and desire in Max's face. After a moment, Max steps aside. Hasari bends his head and makes off. Leaving Max and a small sigh of disappointment.Going to look for work?Are you taking your medicine?You must have had a good doctor. Still no running, jumping, picking up anything heavy. And you stay here. You're going to help Sister Joan and you're going to school. Do you understand? A beat, Poomina nods. But now a look of abject fear comes over her face. The Goonda stands in the doorway. Max begins singing \"Sweet Little Sixteen.\" The Goodna stares impassively at Max.I promised Manooj and Shambu I'd take them to the movies. Is it all right?Thanks, guys. Who wants to go for more peanuts? No one. We're talking about rapt attention. We hear NUTS CRACKING. Max smiles.Ha ha! You can be both! Manooj Pal, swashbuckling physician!I wish my father loved me like your father loves you. Your dad's a very special man. And now, en garde! As the battle continues, the bright beams of a truck come at them.Time out, men. Off the street till this truck passes.I can't do anything here. He's got a compound fracture, he hemorrhaging. We've got to get to a hospital -- now!They'll admit him, but we have to pay for the blood. I gave him all I had. He wants more. Do you have anything?We haven't got any more! The Attendant doesn't move... until he sees Max is about to explode.If this child dies while you stand here, I'll kill you. The Attendant is smart enough not to push any further.Now, I need an X-ray room and I need an O.R. nurse.Then take me to one! As Max takes flight with the Attendant, Aloka strokes Shambu and Hasari hovers. We CLOSE IN ON Shambu's inanimate face and HOLD a moment.We pinned his leg. Couple of months, he'll be better than ever. They want to keep him today. We're a good team. Gimme five. He smiles, holds out a palm for them to slap. They look at the palm, unsure what this means. Yet, each takes Max's hand. EXT. CLINIC - COURTYARD - DAY The whole community is here, around the tree.This is going to cost me every rupee I didn't make today.A letter from your wife. Ram nods nervously. Max looks at the postmark as he slices it open with a finger.This is postmarked six weeks ago.So, what have you been doing -- incubating it?'My dear husband...''Your words brought tears of joy to my arid eyes.'Correct. Her eyes were dry, your letter irrigated them.Listen. I don't want you to think I'm crazy, but I don't think that truck was an accident.Can I go with you? I'll go with you. Can I go with you if I shut up? A beat... and Hasari gives him a small nod.Ashoka ordered me to go home. Well, I've come home.Last time you told me you were more than two women could manage.Okay, you ought to be good for another few days. Send in the next patient.My dear friends, it's just occurred to me what inspired me to stay here. Thinking he's about to make some cogent remark about this unified effort...The opportunity to acquire waterfront property at a reasonable price. Joan begins to laugh; the others don't get it, query each other as to what's funny about that.I'd throw my cape down, but I'm all out of dry capes. He sloshes through the water to them, wiping his muddy hands on his pants. He offers a semi-clean hand to each in turn.It's very nice to see you. Both of you.Shall we unload the car?People grow older; sometimes they even grow up. He smiles a sweet smile at her. She smiles back at him.We're here! We're here! Chomotkar holds the door up as Meeta holds the baby out in the direction of Max's voice. Max catches the baby as the house slips down, then grabs Meeta, who clings to him.Oh, Jesus, the guy went to sleep when he was supposed to be working? I gotta get up -- He tries to get up. Joan pushes him back down.All right. Yeah, I am, I'm all right. He is a little delirious. The boys come close, kneel at his side, instinctively reach out to him.Want you guys to know something. About me. Wanted to be the world's greatest heart surgeon, just one better than my dad. Just one. First time I'm the lead surgeon on a case, the main guy, I choke. Froze. The chief made me step aside. My teacher. Had to take over for me. Went into radiology. Photography. Had to have somethin' easy. No pressure. Wasn't too nuts about myself. Quit. Hasari reaches out and touches Max, telling him with a touch that it's all right. He stares up through bleary eyes at all of them with utterly open love. Amrita holds out a small gift to him: It's a banana leaf, holding a small scoop of rice and surrounded by little decorative leaves.You people... You... I love you guys.Hey, come on, don't do this.Don't do this.Why?You can't do this! He takes no more than a step at Ashoka, a hand coming up, when he's hit hard from behind. Goes to his knees.Jesus Christ. His hand comes away from the back of his head with blood. He tries to rise and is hit again.Why don't you go on home. I'll stay with him. Sunil nods. Max grips Sunil's hand strongly. Sunil goes down the steps. Max moves to Hasari's bedside. He watches Hasari breathing. He looks up at \"The Raft of the Medusa.\"Get serious.How's it going?What do you mean?But that's great.I thought that's why we've been writing all these letters.", "clean_line": "single eyes pop open

letters"}, "ANOTHER ANGLE": {"raw_line": "We see now that, contrary to our assumption that Veejay would be in the left seat, it's Manubai who's flying the plane. The NOISE of the ENGINE forces them to speak somewhat loudly.The Pals, scared, dispirited, weary, consumed by the crowd. They've been walking a long time. Shambu cries; Aloka tries to ease his fear. They stop numbly at the edge of the park, put their bundles down against a long wall. Across the way, a thin policeman shares a cigarette with a group of traders. There is a deeply fearful look in Hasari's eyes, a look he is having difficulty controlling now. He needs to revive the family's confidence. He takes out his precious bundle of rupees and gives one to Manooj. Manooj, though, is fixed on the cinema across the street. Hasari indicates a stall just across the main road.Ravi in her bathrobe.A line of a hundred men stretches from a door. Hasari is on the edge of panic, but when he turns to the family, he's wearing his confident smile. As before, he gathers the family into the protectorate of his arms and guides them onward. As he pushes off into the sea of humanity, we PULL BACK AND UP, FILLING the FRAME WITH street upon street, disappearing Hasari.Shambu runs to his dejected family.Max is guided by a grumpy hall PORTER wearing an off- white shirt and bellbottoms through the walled and well planted courtyard of an inexpensive hotel. Max gives the cow a bemused eye...Swarming police.Hasari seated on a stool, watching his blood leave his body, his face broken out in perspiration.Max on a cot in a tiny, spare room, a butterfly bandage under one eye. Joan, Irish, short, stout, hovers over him. Behind her, Hasari Pal.... to find perhaps fifty people, largely women and children, staring at him.Behind him, The Godfather walks up to the desk, putting his glasses on. He barely glances at his son, but waves him out of the chair. Ashoka doesn't like it, but he steps aside. As he does, he turns a look of hatred on Hasari. Through no fault of his own, Hasari has made an enemy. Ghatak chews on a pan and casts a benevolent eye on Hasari.Ram and Hasari return home. Hasari can hardly walk. Shambu runs to his father, explaining excitedly...It's an amazing sight. Two lepers: ANOUAR, bearded with a sharp intelligent, unmarked face, makes his way along on a small wheeled board, at an amazingly fast pace, ahead of SAID, a huge, mute leper. They stop some feet away. Lepers aren't often welcome. Out from behind Said steps Poomina.Joan turns to Max, who hasn't heard the exchange.Hasari, with Shambu in the rickshaw, arrives to take the children home. As he looks inside, he notices...Hasari arrives with Max, Anouar, and Meeta.Max . Max slings the Goonda against the side of a truck.Ashoka astride his motorcycle, behind his dark glasses, with more thugs, these with Molotov cocktails and pick- axes, ready to raze the clinic and school and the surrounding neighborhood. Sunil drags Mehboub inside. People chant: \"White Monkeys, go home! White Monkeys, go home! No lepers here! No lepers here!\" The thugs cock their iron bars and bricks and Molotov cocktails. Max picks up an iron bar of his own and starts for Ashoka. Suddenly, there's a DETONATION followed by a BLAST of air so fierce, Max is thrown to the ground. A bottle of GASOLINE has EXPLODED just behind him. He's enveloped in smoke.For the first time, we see who Ashoka's speaking to.Hasari seated on the stool, watching his blood leave his body, his face again broken out in perspiration.There, in the entrance to a building, is Gangooly. Seeing a potential victim, he swoops in.Max, in an Indian shirt, heading for the square; rather naturally, he brings his hands together in the Indian salutation. He carries several bottles of distilled water, a large value pack of bar soap, and a carton of medical supplies. As he passes, his eyes hook on Aloka's. He lifts a hand in greeting. After a moment, she ducks her head. He turns and continues on coming face to face with Ram, an enormous smile on his face. With him, Hasari. He glances at his wife in the water....he finds himself face to face with Aloka. Without a word, they start walking side by side toward the square. It's several seconds before she says...Max hurtles down the corridor with a young INTERN in tow. Almost a kid, he's been up for days. But he's going to help.We see Hasari and Max blocking the street with the new rickshaw. The Goonda jumps out of the car, comes threateningly at Hasari.Shoba, a deeply concerned look on his face. Slowly his hands come forward, holding his parrot, with a broken wing. He puts the parrot on the examining table.Max, Hasari, Rassoul, and Chomotkar up to their necks in water; Hasari and Rassoul have a door on their shoulders; on top of the door, a sick leper woman.

Max manages to sit up. Wishes he hadn't.You're in the City of Joy.Oh, now we require that each visitor decide that for himself. This gentleman and a young lady brought you here.I would have to inspect it more closely, but I believe that was one of our economy-size rats. Max clambers for the door. Too late, Joan thinks to say...Watch your -- Max cracks his head on the door frame.Oh no, I'm a corporate executive. Doctor arrives at half seven, but only three days a week.Indeed. What brings you to our country?Ah, yes. I take it you didn't find it.What do you do in America? Max is slow to answer. Discreetly, Hasari hangs back, listens.Oh, how exciting. Must be something illegal. Are you a criminal of some sort?I see. How long are you here? Perhaps I could recruit you for --How very distressing. Why's that?I can't imagine ever divining how to collect, but there are a few of us Indians, you know, who believe the tourist trade ought to be encouraged.I'm afraid they cleaned you out. Ram, here's your first rider. Take this.Go on, it's all right. You'll owe me two.Well, all right, junior, so you'll owe me three.Oh, it was just a whim in the beginning really -- to try to convince them not to be so bloody passive, that they could pull themselves up on their own. I get a little money from a Swiss organization. Now it's become a bit more than I can manage.We just need a few more hands on this little life raft we've set afloat here.You know what I've come to think in my middle age, Max?There are really only three actions open to a person.To run, to spectate, to commit. Max peers at her a moment, then around the square.Charity! It's not charity, dear child, it's love. You're very badly twisted around, aren't you?Good night, God bless, Doctor. Generous young man.It was Poomina who brought you to us. She has herself and her sister to support. It's all right, Poomina. Anouar, what is it? She moves to them. They're all three badly out of breath.Dr. Sunil isn't here.Max, I wouldn't ask, but it's an emergency. A pregnancy gone awry. It's a leper. Could you have a look? Max is clearly thrown by the sight of the lepers.Good Christ, son, because she's a leper doesn't mean she's not built like a woman!It's too far.Oh nonsense! It's not contagious!For a non-practicing doctor, that was pretty practiced.Max, please, won't you change your mind? We desperately need another doctor. Full-time. Think about it -- just give us a couple of months.Then what do you want? What are you going to be when you grow up? Good night, Aloka, Hasari. Joan goes inside, leaving Max, Aloka, and a very uncom- fortable Hasari alone a moment.Jesus, my brother, you who I am trying to believe are the light and salvation of the puking worldPlease see that we are living in madness and darkness here...... and we need help. Om, Jesus, om and amen. Suddenly, he hurtles into motion. He runs down the alley, his stride stretching out, swallowing up the distance between here and the world beyond the City of Joy in great gulps.I'll be happy to buy the medication, but Dr. Loeb is not part of this endeavor, Anouar; there is only his cherished memory.Well, well, well, I do so love to be surprised.Max, knock it off, give us a bit of hush. What happened?And I'm a bloody bathing beauty.Smart girl... So how long am I stuck with you?Not worth the aggravation of your prattle every day. Six months -- and not a day less.Two months -- and that's my final offer.Jesus and Mary. The Lone Ranger rides again. And now smiles creep onto all their faces as Max goes inside, followed by Joan... and then Aloka -- after she looks at Hasari, gets his nod of encouragement. Too late, Joan says...Watch your -- Thud!Well, I think we've got three very good potential scholars here. Behind the children's backs, she points at Manooj and indicates the kid's really got a head.Given him some time here, he'll be good enough for a proper school.We'd like to better serve the entire community, Mr. Ghatak.I understand the rent would have to go up if we rent larger quarters from you, Mr. Ghatak, but why should we have to pay more protection?But we can't afford it!If we pay you that, we won't have any money for supplies.Have you gone right off your rocker!? These people don't have a sense of humor. Are you trying to get yourself killed?Stop it, you... you... you nudnick! He doesn't stop, and as she storms off down the street, he stays right on her, tickling away.Well, I think Max has hit on the heart of what we're trying to build here: a self-help society. Each of us has to decide for himself. As for me, I suppose I think, really, that if the bastards are going to suck us dry, I'd like to get in a couple of good left- handers before I turn the other cheek.Yes, Mr. Bhose?They are going to be treated at the dispensary. You have no right to stop them.Go ahead, Aloka, take them inside. The Goonda puts his hand on Aloka. The policeman in the b.g. keep their distance.Take your hands off her, you waster! Joan is seized by a sudden fury and grabs the Goonda. He grabs her much harder. Said growls and pushes forward. Several thugs turn, step in to neutralize him. Joan elbows the Goonda and tires to westle free of him. As a reflex he raises his hand. And as he does, it's seized.We'll pay! All right then, so by all means, protect us! Ashoka raises a hand, The Goonda blows a whistle, and the fighting stops as suddenly as it began. The com- batants are breathing heavily. There is silence but for the groans and cries of the wounded and grieving.I'll try.Not everyone's cut out for this. You did the best you could. Better than many. It's all right.You know, the fact is from the minute we're born we're shipwrecked. Some see that as a lifetime of drowning, of fear, others only to endure, but to triumph. It's all in the individual spirit, isn't it?Then, by all means, go home, Max, and go with my blessing and my eternal friendship. The candlelight flickers against them as they sit side by side. Neither speaks.Hasari has forbid her to have anything more to do with us. He'd be very angry if he knew she was seeing you off. Max looks at Joan. Looks out the window.It's not like he's royalty or anything, so I'm not persuaded we have to wait for the plane to actually take off.Of course. Come with me, please. Joan leaves, followed by The Goonda. Max works care- fully at the fine line of scabbing on Poomina's scar... but then something takes his attention.You'll never get a taxi at this hour.I don't think it was an accident. I think they were aiming for Max. So, what we have to ask ourselves is whether his presence is endangering all of us.What's happened?I hate to admit it, junior, but that was actually quite witty. She whacks him on the shoulder with a wet, muddy paw.Ut-nobody laugh; it's a natural disaster -- we have guests. Everyone turns to...Sshh, sshh, sshh! No heroics, junior. Lay back.

Anyone can run at this pace. But you think it's easy to run and to pull?Will you still pay me when he runs you into a ditch?All right, you, come, step in here. Hasari looks on Max with enormous gratitude. Ram puts the shafts down, has a short coughing fit, spits some phlegm, looks at Max.Now, fine, pull, go. Hasari tries to pull, but the center of gravity isn't easy to find. This is enormously difficult and Hasari's very clumsy at it. The street is crowded. The traffic is beginning to back up behind them. The driver and conductor of the tram let fly a tirade of insults.See, mister! What did I tell you? Come on! What do you think this is -- some village street? You've got to move quickly. He turns to Max.You see, it takes a gift.Yes, yes, I am wondering, sir, we are, is it possible you might have something for my friend? Ram indicates Hasari, as if there might be some question to whom he's referring. Ashoka attacks the pimple.Let me explain it for your ears, sir. My cousin from Bihar has just arrived in our city --Oh yes! I have personally witnessed his excellence -- yes.Let Hasari go! The line of rickshaw pullers turns to Hasari. The other pullers wish him well as he comes forward. His heart pounds; ever so politely, he helps the School Girl into his carriage. She gives him the address of the St. Pius School.Feed the police! Other pullers laugh, call after Hasari... and as he approaches the first corner, he manages to pull out a rupee and deposit it into the hand of the impassive traffic policeman and then turn right.Another few months, I'll be able to pay off the moneylender in my village and go home and open a grocery shop. All around me sacks overflowing with all kinds of dal and rice, aromatic spices, piles of vegetables... and at night, I'll lie on my back beneath the trees sniffing fresh aubergines. This beautiful picture burrows into Hasari's mind. For a moment, he goes there -- home, to the village...If my wife will let me come within a hundred miles of the place where she herself resides. Ram laughs, Hasari smiles...It was six hundred rupees only. He laughs at the impossibility of the price.Doctor Big Brother, I myself would be willing to accept a gift. Could you give me five rupees in a note -- ten, perhaps. My ankle is badly swelled; the higher the number the more the swelling sinks. Max has to laugh.How much?You can't do that. They're outcasts, they're unclean. There are murmurs of assent from the others.It has come to me tonight to write a letter to my wife. Ram produces a mangled one piece letter -- envelope.Please.Yes -- what is the word -- that word -- when land is watered... with canals?Yes, yes, that word, I want that word in the letter. Max looks at him, nods, waits. Ram stares at Max; waits.Well?I don't know, Max Daddah. If I knew what to say to my wife, I'd never have left home. Everybody laughs, though Ram's remark hits Max on a deeper level. Manooj slides in beside him.What I earn is yours, too.Yes, he is. Ram has a small coughing fit.Yes, yes, but look at this. He points at the wheel of his rickshaw; the rim is cracked. Scornfully, Hasari walks on. Max and Ram glance after him. Max digs out several rupees. Ram takes them and goes. Max looks after the two men as they disappear. When he turns...Doctor Daddah, please, very important, only one moment.So?I was afraid. Ram waits, his hands twisting each other.Oh that's very hopeful so far!Oh, I'm in love! My words brought tears to her arid eyes! What does that mean -- arid? Manooj throws his hand up.Aaah!At my wedding I became so frightened, my father gave me things to drink to calm me down. I went out to piss and fell asleep under the village tree. When I woke I thought it was the tree I'd married. I still love that tree. The laugh. But Hasari's attention is on his daughter. He reaches a loving hand to her.I'm wet and I'm cold. Your daughter is getting married. Time is passing. I want to go home to my wife.All that stands between them now is the ounce of gold. Max Daddah, Joan Di -- is she a good reader?She read this letter to me. But I think she must have read it wrong. She said my wife writes that irrigation has come to our village.But it means I should go home to my wife.Yes, of course, I love her from here, yes; but, what if I go home and find I don't love her from there. Shambu takes him by the hand and tugs him quickly to the edge of the tea shop. The little boy indicates Max should bend close.

Can he neigh at least? You -- do your ears function?Neigh! Like a horse. Ashoka pulls back his lips, shows his teeth and imitates a neigh: \"Ne-igh! Ne-igh!\"Don't touch me. No one touches me.Not working? How will my father eat this evening?You have a daughter?Keep working. Give this to Sister Joan and your friend the doctor when you go home. Now he hands Hasari a sealed envelope and turns his ear loose. Hasari springs toward his passenger.You!The entire package we're proposing will cost you three thousand rupees a month. Joan is taken aback by the sum.I'm told you're very resourceful.How do you expect to make a profit off of lepers and the poor, Doctor?Who gave you your rickshaw?Who provides the food you eat?Remember: Loyalty. He gives Hasari's ear a last tug... and the car continues on, leaving Hasari. He looks at his children, ashamed to have been cowed. Manooj fixes his father with a hard look.You taking that to the clinic? You like it there? And they love your smile, don't they? She's fearful now and doesn't respond. He grabs her, the water pitcher crashes to the ground, he puts his knife into her mouth and lays her face open on both side with his knife.In a world such as ours, everyone needs protection. For the fee we discussed, from this day forward, I can assure you nothing like this will happen again.You. I warned you about the company you keep. He REVS his MOTORCYCLE and SCREECHES away, leaving Hasari staring after him in his dust.Well. What have you got to say?From this minute, you are off the list! You will leave your rickshaw here... where it will be reserved for a man who deserves our trust. He stands up. Hasari is near tears.My father's ill! You are speaking to me!The decision is made. I have made it. Now get out before I have Mr. Bhose break your legs. He gives Hasari's ear a vicious twist and slams his head against the table.Do you know how much it costs to change the spoke in a wheel? Or how much baksheesh I have to pay the police? Impulsively, Hasari moves forward. Cries from pullers: \"Who will be the victims of this madness? You?\" \"Hell no!\" \"You don't need the six rupees each old crate brings you per day to fill your belly! For us, it means death!\" The street is so packed with rickshaw and pullers now that cars can't get through. A chorus of HORNS HONK; drivers scream.That's what I thought. All right, get to work! Customers are waiting!We helped this man! We gave him a job, a place to live! This is how he shows his gratitude. Get on the streets now! Or turn in your machines! Hasari gets up and tries to speak.Go home, Doctor. Before he can respond, he's slammed down into the tub of water again and held there until it seems his lungs will explode. Then he's dumped backward, gasping for breath.You've become very brave of late, haven't you?Oh, I do what I please. You see, my father's dead, I'm in charge now. So you will get off my streets, you will leave my country, and that clinic and school will close.My father was weak. He let you and your European friend give these little people ideas. It's over.No, no, come forward. Come. Ashoka glides toward the petrified Amrita. The Goonda remains unmoving, watchful. Ashoka puts out his hand with its rings, and strokes Amrita's cheek.What a little woman already, hey?What did you say?She's going to give someone a lot of enjoyment. Yes.He said 'please' didn't he? 'Please, don't touch her?' The Goonda stares at Ashoka... And now Ashoka reaches out and we FOLLOW CLOSE on his hand as it moves ever so slowly through space to settle on Amrita's breast. And now Hasari explodes. He hits Ashoka. A hard punch to the chest. Ashoka stumbles and falls to one knee.Bhose, help me! Hasari unloads a punch into Ashoka's face; Ashoka's nose pours blood; he starts to whimper. He clutches Hasari hard to him. Holds him. Hasari struggles, slams his palm into Ashoka's chin, sending Ashoka to the ground, sending the knife skidding across the ground. Hasari grabs the knife, straddles Ashoka, about to kill.
