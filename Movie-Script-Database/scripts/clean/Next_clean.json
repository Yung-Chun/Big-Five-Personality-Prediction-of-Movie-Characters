{"Next": {"CRIS": {"raw_line": "And \"we\" is...?Just the check.It's a joke, but it's true. The future changes every time you look at it. Because you looked at it.Cause once you see it, you're different.Maybe just a little.And that changes everything else.It's got something to do with quantum physics.Try that one, man. I've got a feeling.Against my religion.Do it, quick, before somebody else gets there.Mainly I stick to blackjack. Boring but controllable.And safe unless they think you're counting.Grand Dad, rocks.Scuse me, sorry.Most of the time, I'm not paying attention. Just making sure I don't step in a mess.Sometimes I get a blast from far away.Or I can start with a glimpse of something close and keep pushing on.Usually it's none of my business.Guy around?Tell him it's King Midas.I need to cash some chips. - Got tagged.I've been trying to lay low.He was gonna kill you! You all would'a died!That was the night Donna broke off our engagement.I was so drunk I could barely see now.Christ, Guy, did you have to?Well, you can save your breath. Cause I know what you're gonna say.I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm done playing the market.Except last time, Neal didn't take \"finito\" for an answer.I can stay ahead of `em forever.Because I don't want to be used any more.Cause what I want is freedom. And you don't get it by giving it up.Enjoy it while it lasts.Looking for this?Don't mess with somebody who knows your moves before you even think 'em.Don't wait for me.I came to fix you dinner.Sometimes not knowing is better.If I tell `em the truth, you know what happens? I end up with the Feds. - And you know what they do to me?It's not funny, Irv. That's all I do, day after day, for the rest of my life. Watch the news until I lose my hair and croak.The best I can do is stay away from all of `em.I know, I know, but there's something I gotta do first.She's coming here. The Fed.Let's play it out.I've got the place all picked out. It's called Palau. Three hundred teeny islands in the South Pacific. Nothing ever happens there, so there's nothing to foresee.Her.I haven't met her yet.It has to be her.She's the mother of my child.I guess the doctors were wrong.He's got my thing.My thing.Agent Ferris, come in.Let's go in the kitchen. I've got a roast in the oven.Yeah, people say I could have been a chef.Everyone but you, of course.Trust me, it's better if I don't. It's better if I just mind my own business.Nobody's grabbed me yet.I know, I know, I've got the place picked out. But there's something I've gotta do first.I have to go.I know, but they're coming for me.This is for nurses and stuff, to make things a little easier.I looked, Irv, I really did. I went down every path, every treatment. Sometimes there's just no...Mind if I join you?Is that cruller any good?Shopping for a car?Rough day?I'm so sorry. I'm a spaz.Why would I do that?Look, I'm sorry. If I could, I'd do it over.Here.Well, Liz, your luck's about to change.You met me.An angel, actually. And we always reward the people who help us.You don't have to do anything.But I could use a ride.It already has.Not even a tingle?Then you're way overdue. For a reversal of fortune.Any kids?I mean of your own.I guess that's good. Considering.I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.He didn't want to adopt?It already has.Take this exit. Quick!Just take it!No it's not!Traffic was piling up. You didn't see it?We could'a been stuck there for hours.You're right. I'm sorry. I panicked. I get phobic sitting in traffic. It won't happen again, I promise.How `bout at the next gas station? Please. I'll fill up your tank.I am really really really really sorry.But lately I've been traveling all around Oregon. It's really peaceful up there.Exactly.Well, thanks for the ride.You're welcome.I understand...Well, see ya.Sierra Pale.Just a friend.Easy, man.Easy, man.No ho'pital. I don' nee' ho'pital.I'm sorry I'm causing you all this trouble.Actually, I wasn't standing for that long.Why didn't you?What a terrible quality. You're too loyal.Once you start watching, it's hard not to get involved.Almost.She wanted kids.It's just that...I can't.I don't know. You asked and...I guess I felt like you'd understand.That was incredible.This.You said it was broken.I - I didn't think of it. - I thought you'd be happy to see me.Do you want me to leave these somewhere?All right then. I'll just go.I've got a better idea. Run away with me to the South Pacific.But we're going to be happy together for the rest of our lives. Really, I peeked.Deadly.Let's go pack your bags. We'll leave tonight.Don't worry. That's always been easy for me.Why?They'll replace you.They can pick up the slack.I - I don't think it's okay. I'm not that kind of person. But I have this feeling, this very strong feeling, that it has to be now. We have to leave soon, or it's not gonna work out.Yes, but sometimes you have to make it happen. You have to seize the opportunity before it's too late.Your students are very lucky.But then you have to sign the divorce papers.I said I'll pay.No need for that. I'll give you cash. Okay? Will you take cash?Okay, three.What do you want me to do? Wait for people to die?Look, there's something I've been wanting to tell you.It does.It's not religious. I just happen to see my life before it happens.Flip it.Just do it.Heads.Flip it again. Tails.Tails. Heads. Tails.Now you believe me?Liz. Don't you see? I can get us all the money we need.Why? Because I care so much about kids that sometimes I overreact?Believe me, the feeling is mutual.What do you mean?You want to talk to my doctor? I'll get him on the phone. No, really, I mean it. I'll have him send you my records. Because I want you to trust me.All the time. - But mainly how to stay out of trouble.There's only one thing I've ever wanted.A family.Well, I was, as they say, left on a doorstep when I was two. Never found foster parents who could put up with me. - So to me, a family sounds like plenty.I wish.God, this is gorgeous.What's wrong?You mean, do I believe a higher power brought us together?No. I think we're just the last in a long chain of accidents that started with the Big Bang.Oh, but it is. Think of it: For us to meet, everything from the very beginning, every sub-atomic event, every galactic cataclysm, every step of evolution, every act, every accident, every decision in the history of the universe had to happen exactly the way it did just so you and I could be together, right here and now.To whatever happens next.Why?Late?I do now.I have no idea. Unless...But that still doesn't explain...Liz, I really did have this problem. I wasn't lying to you.But this is good. This is amazing. I want this baby more than anything.For both of us.You lying bitch! You betrayed me!Liz, please, I love you.Let me talk to you for one minute. I won't hurt you, I promise.The man I killed was there to rob the store. He was going to panic and shoot five innocent people.Because I saw them die.Yes.Not \"might\"! Those people died! - They just hadn't died yet.Once.That's why I don't go out much. So I won't be there to see.If they catch me, they'll put me in a cell without a trial, and they'll never let me out. They do that, you know.There's one decent path. But if we're gonna stay on it, I need you to do exactly what I say.Will you give me one chance? One chance in exchange for a miracle?A few steps on, your robe will get caught on a thornbush. You won't be able to get unstuck. Ferris and a tough guy will come help you. She'll say, \"You've done your country a great service.\"Be unpredictable. Surprise works to my advantage. - And read this when you're safe.Bet on it.Believe me now?Where were you going?I'll check on our ride.Right now I'm just trying to stay alive.Just the opposite. I never take chances.Did the doctors ever say why you couldn't have kids?What's that?Except you're not. And neither am I. We're different, that's all. We just had to find the right match.Oh shit. Oh no.I blew it.GET OUT! NOW! OR YOU'LL DIE!Why does everybody have amnesia but me?Don't let them know you're pregnant.I'll get us out of here. We can still make the plane.\"From now on, Cris, the bullets are real.\"I'm going. No need for a hotfoot.Why?I know what happens.You tie me down and never let me out.Because you're trying to force me.I don't believe you.Don't get too attached to your arms and legs.He hasn't got the balls.I'd say you have way too much.Give me your keys.If I see you, I'll kill her.\"We got off on the wrong foot.\"\"all been a big misunderstanding.\"\"We've never meant you any harm.\"I guess you're a better liar than I am.It'll never happen.When are they going to give up? After you're dead?To a gang of murderers?What's about to happen...you've brought it on yourselves.I'm planning on it.Get out!I guess...They didn't explain. They were trying to force me.Liz? Where are you going?But I have conditions.Liz...I can't. - I have to go.There's something I have to do. Something you'd want me to do. And I can't put it off any longer.Liz, it's not like that. I searched for you for a long time. I want to be with you forever.But a lot has happened since then.We're going to have a child.I don't expect you to believe me. But when you do find out, remember that we came together for a reason. That this wasn't just...one night. It was a special chance for both of us.I'm not...I'm taking the long way around.And I looked for a happy ending... But this was the best I could do.I wouldn't be surprised.I wasn't ready till now.\"The future ain't what it used to be.\" Ever hear that expression?", "clean_line": "check joke true future changes time look looked cause different maybe little changes got quantum physics try man ve got feeling religion quick somebody gets mainly stick blackjack boring controllable safe think counting grand dad rocks scuse sorry time paying attention making sure step mess blast far away start glimpse close pushing usually business guy tell king midas need cash chips got tagged ve trying lay low gonna kill died night donna broke engagement drunk barely christ guy save breath cause know gonna sorry hear playing market time neal finito answer stay ahead em forever want cause want freedom giving enjoy lasts looking mess somebody knows moves think em wait came fix dinner knowing better tell em truth know happens end feds know funny irv day day rest life watch news lose hair croak best stay away em know know gotta coming fed let play ve got place picked called palau teeny islands south pacific happens foresee haven met mother child guess doctors wrong got thing thing agent ferris come let kitchen ve got roast oven yeah people chef course trust better better mind business grabbed know know ve got place picked ve gotta know coming nurses stuff things little easier looked irv went path treatment mind join cruller good shopping car rough day sorry spaz look sorry liz luck change met angel actually reward people help use ride tingle way overdue reversal fortune kids mean guess good considering sorry mean pry want adopt exit quick traffic piling stuck hours right sorry panicked phobic sitting traffic won happen promise bout gas station ll tank sorry lately ve traveling oregon peaceful exactly thanks ride welcome understand ya sierra pale friend easy man easy man ho pital nee ho pital sorry causing trouble actually wasn standing long terrible quality loyal start watching hard involved wanted kids know asked guess felt like understand incredible said broken think thought happy want leave right ll ve got better idea run away south pacific going happy rest lives peeked deadly let pack bags ll leave tonight worry easy ll replace pick slack think okay kind person feeling strong feeling leave soon gonna work yes happen seize opportunity late students lucky sign divorce papers said ll pay need ll cash okay cash okay want wait people die look ve wanting tell religious happen life happens flip heads flip tails tails heads tails believe liz money need care kids overreact believe feeling mutual mean want talk doctor ll phone mean ll send records want trust time mainly stay trouble thing ve wanted family left doorstep foster parents family sounds like plenty wish god gorgeous wrong mean believe higher power brought think long chain accidents started big bang oh think meet beginning sub atomic event galactic cataclysm step evolution act accident decision history universe happen exactly way right happens late idea explain liz problem wasn lying good amazing want baby lying bitch betrayed liz love let talk minute won hurt promise man killed rob store going panic shoot innocent people saw die yes people died hadn died won catch ll cell trial ll let know decent path gonna stay need exactly chance chance exchange miracle steps robe caught thornbush won able unstuck ferris tough guy come help ll ve country great service unpredictable surprise works advantage read safe bet believe going ll check ride right trying stay alive opposite chances doctors couldn kids different right match oh shit oh blew ll die everybody amnesia let know pregnant ll plane cris bullets real going need hotfoot know happens tie let trying force believe attached arms legs hasn got balls way keys ll kill got wrong foot big misunderstanding ve meant harm guess better liar ll happen going dead gang murderers happen ve brought planning guess explain trying force liz going conditions liz want longer liz like searched long time want forever lot happened going child expect believe remember came reason wasn night special chance taking long way looked happy ending best wouldn surprised wasn ready till future ain hear expression"}, "LIZ": {"raw_line": "Yeah, actually I do.What business is it of yours?Aw Christ! Look what you've done!Yeah, you are.It looked like you spilled it on purpose.I don't know. To impress me?How's that?And what are you, a leprechaun?Great, what do I have to do?When does the luck kick in?I don't feel anything.Son, I haven't had a tingle in eight months.Thirty. I teach fifth grade.No, that was the problem. - I couldn't get pregnant.You didn't. I'm just running off at the mouth. - That's why I was in Vegas. To see another doctor.No, he had to have a Randy Junior.What, is there an accident?When does the luck kick in?I don't feel anything.Why?It's too late!Let go! Are you out of your mind?!Get out!GET OUT!!I don't give a flyin' goddamn! You don't grab the steering wheel!Damn straight, cause you won't be in the car!All right, I'm starting getting the picture. - Basically, you're a no- good, worthless ramblin' man who's never held a job in life.This is where I turn into town.Thanks for the card.No, no, I've gotta teach tomorrow.So long.Well, maybe just a quick one.Hey, George.I'll take the usual and he'll have a...He's not here now, is he?Thanks.We gotta split. My ex is here.Sure, Randy. I'll call you tomorrow.I'm not yours anymore, asshole!Get out of here! Get out!Stop it, Randy! Stop it!Get out of here! Get out!Oh God, I'll take you to the emergency room.God, I hate that bastard...Will somebody get some ice!Are you kidding? You stood up for me.Sorry it's so cold in here. The heater's broken.I really should've left him a long time ago. God knows he deserved it.Cause I don't leave. I never have. My boyfriends always left me.I get attached to people, and then I'll put up with anything.Sit in the light.I never minded that I was the more devoted one. Somebody's gotta be more this or more that.But they never appreciate it, that you're there for them.They just try and get away with more and more, and figure you'll just...Salty.Christ, I don't even know you. I have no idea who you are.Sorry to get you caught up in my soap opera.You ever been married?What happened?And you didn't?Why are you telling me this? These personal details.That was...I've never...What the hell are you doing?Well, you're not leaving till it's fixed, I'll tell you that.As long as it's done right.And what was the main staple of their diet?From the lake?Right. And the Washo were so jealous of their fishing grounds that when other Native Americans came to trade for dried fish, they were only permitted to remain one night.What are you doing here?Ice cream sandwiches? Do you have any idea how much fat they have in them? Don't you see how overweight half of them are?Well next time exercise a little forethought, okay?No.Put a few in the freezer. I love ice cream sandwiches.You have been such a bad influence. I'm gonna be up all night grading papers.Funny. We've only known each other a week.I think you're serious.And what'll we do for money?This is ridiculous.Well, first of all, it's the middle of the school year.And I'm in charge of science fair.It disturbs me, Cris, that you think it's okay just to duck your responsibilities.I don't believe that. If it's meant to be between two people, somehow it'll happen.What are you afraid of, Cris? Why are you running away from yourself?Now I've got to grade papers.Cris.So you throw rocks at them?Cris...I think you should move on. Today.It doesn't matter.What are you saying, you're some sort of prophet?Cris, it's sweet that you feel responsible for people. But I think you need help.Why?Yeah. And I don't want to have anything to do with you.Don't follow me. Don't talk to me. Get out of my life!Cris...I think you should move on. Today.I swear, I can't figure you out.Sometimes you seem mindlessly impulsive. But other times I feel like you're utterly calculating, saying exactly what you think'll push my buttons.Don't you think it's kind of an amazing coincidence that neither of us can have kids?Then open up. Talk to me. Where are you going with your life?No goals? Dreams? Ambitions?What's that?That's all? Just a family?You've got to be making this up.You poor guy.I'll meet you inside. I need to pick something up at the drug store.Yes?He's not a killer. He needs help.You're not gonna let them.Okay, I'll talk to him. I'll try to get him to...I ran into a friend I hadn't seen in a while.She said we could use her cabin up at the peak.Nothing.Cris. Do you think we met for a reason?Yeah.That's not very romantic.I shouldn't.I'm late.That's why I went to the drug store. To get a pregnancy test.You know what this means?How did it...?It's like a miracle.Cris, I know you don't mean to hurt people. But you need help or you're going to keep on hurting them.How do you know this?Like yesterday, with the car?You were afraid something bad might happen so you...What if you hadn't done anything? Have you ever waited to see what would happen?Cris, you're a good man. And I will stand by you through this. But you have to...I won't let it happen. I'll get you a lawyer.Cris...Cris.And then?Will I see you again?Then why do I feel like a traitor?I trust him more than I trust you.You've never even met him.I'm getting used to miracles.No idea. I was just trying to be unpredictable.So what's the plan? Bonnie and Clyde?It's starting to sound really good.Will we make it?Christ, you live dangerously.I grew up at Love Canal.A neighborhood back East built over a chemical dump. A bunch of my friends had birth defects. I always figured I was lucky just to be sterile.And somehow we did.You make it look easy.I promise.Work with them Cris. So we can be together.You're not going to kill me. That's what the bad guys do.Cris isn't the enemy.Can't you just leave us alone?This is what they wanted you to prevent?And you wouldn't help?You're not leaving?Fine. Then go. What do I care?Don't overdo it. We just met last night.While I was sleeping?Then you really are an angel.Then why are you running away from me?I don't understand.
