{"42": {"RICKEY": {"raw_line": "Gentlemen, I have a plan... As of now, only the Board of Directors and my family know.My wife says I'm too old, That my health isn't up to it. My son says that every one in baseball will be against me. But I'm going to do it.I'm going to bring a Negro ballplayer to the Brooklyn Dodgers.There's no law against it, Clyde.So be it. New York is full of Negro baseball fans; every dollar is green. I don't know who he is, or where he is, but he's coming.No.A heck of a player. But too sweet, they'll eat him alive.Too old. We need a man with a future not a past. (holds up his ownA four sport college man, out of UCLA. That means he's played with white boys.For refusing to sit in the back of a military bus. Ft. Hood, Texas. The driver asked him to move back. The MPs had to take him off.I see he resents segregation. If he were white, we'd call it spirit!Robinson's a Methodist. I'm a Methodist. God's a Methodist. We can't go wrong. Find him. Bring him here.Do you have a girl?A man needs a family relying on him. It insures he'll behave responsibly. Do you have a girl?You think so? Jack looks to Sukeforth who smiles placidly. Back to Rickey.Do you love her? Rachel?Marry her. What? Rickey stands, walks to a window. Jack looks at Sukeforth who raises a hand as if to say: Give it a chance.Baseball's a hard life; a man needs a good woman by his side. You don't want the only person waiting for you at home to be a catcher. Sukeforth chuckles at that. Rickey fingers open a slat on the blind and peers out. Jack looks hard at him.This is about baseball. Rickey opens the shade. Sunlight floods in. Rickey follows it to the chalkboard, to the list of players under Montreal.I see you starting in the spring with our affiliate in Montreal. If you make it there, we'll try you down here with the Dodgers. The white Brooklyn Dodgers. Jack looks to Sukeforth who nods: Yes, you heard right.I'll pay you $600 a month and a $3,500 bonus when you sign the contract. Is that agreeable? Believe it or not that's a lot of money to Jack on this day in time. This is all becoming a bit overwhelming.There is one condition. I have a pile of scouting reports. I know you can hit behind the runner, that you can read a pitch. The question is can you control your temper?Yes your temper! Are you deaf?! Rickey furious, the avuncular old man gone. Jack sits there, fists now balled. Rickey to Sukeforth like he's not there:He looks proud. Willful.I want to win! I want ballplayers who can win! Are you one of them?!A black man in white baseball. Imagine the reaction. The vitriol. Rickey strides forward, gets in his face.The Dodgers check into a hotel. A decent good hotel. You're worn out from the road and some clerk won't give you the pen to sign in.The team stops at a restaurant. The waiter won't take your order. Didn't you see the sign on the door? No animals allowed.I want one who has the guts not to fight back! There are people who will not like this. They will do anything to get you to react. If you echo a curse with a curse, they will only hear yours. Follow a blow with a blow and they will say a Negro lost his temper; that the Negro does not belong. Your enemy will be out in force, but you can not meet him on his own low ground. We win with hitting, running and fielding, nothing else. We win if the world is convinced of two things: that you are a fine gentlemen and a great ballplayer. Like our Savior, you must have the guts to turn the other cheek. Jack considers Rickey. Rickey looks worn out.Can you do it? Jack poised at what will be his Rubicon. He crosses.Who's the best shortstop you ever saw?Rabbit Tavener? And you call yourself a sports writer?Pop Lloyd.Wagner is number two. And Rabbit Tavener would not break my top 25. Where do you suppose Jackie Robinson will end up on that list?Alright then, where would he rate at second?High praise. He'll have to be the best in the minor leagues first.I'm saying it's going to be a very interesting spring training. A lot of players are coming back from the war and with gas rationing over, we can train down in Florida again.Those towns may as well be a million miles from Daytona.I spoke to the Daytona mayor. He assures me there'll be no trouble. But Rickey doesn't sound so sure. They consider each other.Mr. Smith, are you a Communist?I have a business proposition. What's your salary at the Courier?I will pay you an additional fifty dollars a week plus expenses if you will attend spring training with Jackie Robinson. You will watch over him, help him to avoid the harm that could come if he were to do or say anything out of turn. You will act as his chauffeur, you will secure accommodations for him wherever the team may be, help him find restaurants, etc...Unprecedented access for any reportage you feel appropriate. What do you say, Mr. Smith?Ebbets Field actually, but yes, I agree. The world is ready.How are they looking, Leo?A bus? Harold, how in blazes did he end up on a bus?! BOB BRAGAN, in his catching gear, passing by with pitchers RALPH BRANCA and KIRBY HIGBE. Higbe asides to Bragan:Listen to this, Harold. Whenever I hear a white man - yours truly - broadcasting what a Moses he is to the Negro race, then I know the latter needs a bodyguard. (Parrott tries toThe minor league commissioner of baseball said that! I pay part of his salary! You wouldn't stab me in the back like this, would you?Why didn't you say so?!Clay, I'd like you to meet Jackie Robinson. Jackie, Clay Hopper, manager of the Montreal Royals. Hopper shakes his hand as they exchange greetings.I agree. And I'll state another obvious, Clay, I need the players to act like gentlemen around him.To treat him as they would any other teammate.To be natural, to impose no restrictions on themselves. To all work together in harmony. WHACK! The hit & run is on. The man on first runs on the pitch as a LOW LINE DRIVE shoots for the gap between 1st and 2nd. Robinson turns himself inside out to dive on his belly and catch it before it hits the ground. He spins himself around, pivots on a knee to throw the runner out before he can get back to first. \u00c2 Rickey is astounded.That was superhuman.Clay, I realize that attitude is part of your heritage; that you practically nursed race prejudice at your mother's breast, so I will let it pass. But I will add this: you can manage Robinson fairly and correctly or you can be unemployed. They both look over as Jack comes off the field toward them.I see... Yes, I understand. Wake him up and get him out of there. Put him in the car and start driving for Daytona Beach. Now. And, Wendell, under no circumstance tell him what this is about. I do not want him to get it in his head to stay there and fight.I've spoken to the mayor. I've explained how much money we'll spend in Daytona. But still, when this fine young Negro man steps on that field today, he and the Dodgers will technically be breaking the law. A law which says white and black players cannot enjoy the same field at the same time. Does that make sense to you? Does Jim Crow make any sense when placed against the words of the United States Constitution? When placed against the word of God? POP OUT to reveal he sits beside the DODGER BATBOY, so short his feet don't touch the ground. Rickey offers his peanut bag. As the batboy takes one...I'll tell you, it does not make sense to me.Watching from a seat behind third.Thataway, Jackie! Thataway!Bermuda grass grows so well here. I wish we could get it to grow like this in Brooklyn.Me, too. Rickey consider the field a moment, then Jack.Jackie, it's my pleasure to tell you that you've earned a spot on the Montreal Royals. When they head north Tuesday for opening day against Jersey City, you'll be on the train. Jack trying to hold down his excitement.I know that.Give her my regards. Jack about to head off when he looks back..I'm an opportunist. With you and the Negro players I hope to bring up next year I'll put together a team that can win the World Series. And the World Series means money. Jack studies him a beat, not quite buying it.Don't you believe that?Agreed. Therefore, run the bases like the Devil himself.Worry those pitchers so they come apart. Sometimes they'll catch you, but don't worry about that. Ty Cobb got caught plenty. Just run as you see fit. Put the natural fear of God into them.Good evening. I have something very important to talk with you about tonight. Something that will require courage from all of us.I have a ballplayer on my Montreal team named Jackie Robinson. The start of applause. Rickey motions for it to stop.He may stay there or he may be brought to Brooklyn. But if Jackie does come up to the Dodgers, the biggest threat to his success, the one enemy most likely to ruin that success, is the Negro people themselves! There is shocked silence in the room. Rickey notices a group of KIDS watching from a raised running track, soldiers on:I say it as cruelly as I can to make you all realize the weight of responsibility that is not only on myself and the Dodgers, but on Negroes everywhere. For on the day Jackie enters the National League, if he does, I have no doubt every one of you will form parades and welcoming committees. You'll strut. You'll wear badges. You'll hold Jackie Robinson days and Jackie Robinson nights. You'll get drunk, fight and be arrested. This is too much. People are slackjawed. Rickey powers on.You'll wine and dine him until he is fat and futile. You'll symbolize his importance into a national comedy and yes, a tragedy! So let me tell you this! If any group or segment of Negro society uses the advancement of Jackie Robinson in baseball as a triumph of race over race, I will regret the day I ever signed him to a contract, and I will personally see that baseball is never so abused and misrepresented again! Is he done? An embarrassed smattering of applause. Mostly shock and stares. As Rickey stands there uncomfortably...Thank you, Mr. Miller. I'm sorry; the spotlight will be on us all.Another spring training is upon us. In Panama. I need to know your attitude toward Jackie Robinson.Eight times in the Bible we're told to love our neighbor. It's one of God's most repeated commands.If by nice you mean soft, no, not particularly.So you have no objections to him?Yes. Oh -- and Leo?The Bible says a thing or two about adultery as well.Pipe dream? What do you mean by pipe dream? INSERT: Panama City, Panama. March 18, 1947.A team full of tough war veterans? Immigrants' sons? Boys from impoverished parts of the country?You really believe they won't accept him? Once they see how he plays, how he can help them win.Bragan, most of your teammates have recanted on this petition nonsense. Are you really here to tell me you don't want to play with Robinson?And your friends here in Brooklyn? Then I will accommodate you. If you give me your word that you will try your very best for this team until I can work out a trade. That gets Bragan's goat. He jumps up, really mad.Only on yourself apparently. You can go, Bragan.I received your letter, Dixie.I realize, Dixie, that you have a Southern upbringing, that you would have to subordinate your feelings for the welfare of this venture. I for one would deeply appreciate it. I think we can all learn something.Is that what you're you afraid of? Bragan's a third-stringer, but you bat clean-up. You're popular in Brooklyn. Children look up to you!I'll start looking for a trade or a sale. But it won't happen until I get value in return. Until then I expect you to drive in runs.Branch Rickey cannot afford to upset team chemistry and so the only thing keeping Robinson off the Dodgers now, plainly, is the attitude of the players. INSERT: Brooklyn. April 9, 1947.If it softens at the sight of Jackie's skills, he'll join the club some time between April 10 and April 15. Otherwise, Robinson will spend the year back in Montreal. For the love of Pete, he batted .625 in the exhibition games against them, us, them -- Against us! Judas Priest! Rickey flummoxed as the phone RINGS from the outer office.Durocher. Of course, he's my ace in the hole. Very good, Harold. The phone still rings. Rickey looks to his open door.Jane Ann! Are you out there? Grumbling, brambly eyebrows twitching, he makes the mistake of answering his own phone.Branch Rickey... You're speaking to him... The Commissioner of what..? Oh, yes put him on. The commissioner of baseball.Fine. What can I do for you, Happy?I'm sorry, Happy, I thought you said lose Durocher for a year.Anyone who sets foot in Havana is seen with known gamblers.You're joking.Now I'm sure you're joking. Happy checks his nails, returns his hand to the MANICURIST.You know very well my organization is about to enter a tempest. I need Durocher at the rudder. He's the only man who can handle this much trouble, who loves it in fact. You're chopping off my right hand!You can't do that! Happy, you son of a bitch! DIAL TONE. Rickey steadies himself, looks to Parrott.Trouble ahead, Harold. Trouble.I'm so sorry about the rush. Events are unfolding too fast to keep up with. The burden has finally fallen to me and so be it.Yes, yes. As Jack poises the pen -- Rickey suddenly aghast.Stop! The pen a millimeter over the page.History. And I'm blabbing, blabbing through history... Rushing it along. What am I thinking?Jane Ann, come in here. Harold! Parrott sticks his head out from an office down the hall.Get some employees up here!Harold, telegram the press. Say this: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Brooklyn Dodgers today purchased the contract of Jackie Robinson from the Montreal Royals. He will report immediately.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As Jack takes it in, he's the only one not smiling.Opening day, Harold. The world is all future and no past.It's a game of inches, Jackie!Baseball has returned to Brooklyn, Burt. Another season is underway.Inevitable I suppose. I asked him if she was worth it and he said yes. How's the retirement?It's a helluva thing when a man has good health and enough money and absolutely nothing to do.Is that so?Roses and sleep are two wonderful things, Burt. But sleep you can get inside your casket and flowers look good on top of it. You don't look like a dead man to me.I need you to manage the Dodgers. We're a ship without a captain; there's a typhoon ahead.Do you miss the game, Burt? Look me in the eye and tell me you don't. Shotton considers Rickey a beat and then looks away.You promised her you wouldn't put on another uniform. You didn't promise her you wouldn't manage. Wear a suit and tie; Connie Mack still does.You remember what the peanuts smell like roasting, how the crack of the bat sounds, the roar of the crowd?My car's parked right out front. Harold will show you where. Now what do you say?What's he saying?Rickey watches as he disappears inside. Finally exhales.Stands, watches. Praying this doesn't go south. As Jack finally continues on, Rickey closes his eyes in relief.You can't, Jackie. You know it.These men have to live withYou don't matter right now, Jack. You're in this thing. You don't have the right to pull out from the backing of people who believe in you, respect you and who need you.If you fight, they won't say Chapman forced you to; they'll just say that you're over your head. That you belong where you are.That every downtrodden man who wants more from life is over his head. Jack's either going to explode or break into tears.No. You do. You're the one living the sermon. In the wilderness. Forty days. All of it. Only you.Of course there is! You can stand up and hit! You can get on base and you can score! You can win this game for us! We need you as well! Everyone needs you. You're medicine, Jack. Rickey reaches out, touches the wall to stay standing. Jack just breathes as familiar sounds reverb down the tunnel.Who's playing first? Jack considers him. Everything hangs in the balance. Then:When I first told you about Jackie, you were against it. Now all of a sudden you're worrying about him. How do you suppose that happened?Sympathy, Harold, is a Greek word. It means to suffer. I sympathize with you means I suffer with you. This Philadelphia manager has done me a service.Is there an echo in here? Yes, he's creating sympathy on Jackie's behalf. Philadelphia by the way is Greek for brotherly love. The intercom BUZZES.What do you want, Bragan?What about Robinson? Bragan's been staring at the floor. He looks up now. The low afternoon sun hits his face.Why?Do you remember the story, Burt, of the 99 sheep? How one was missing?I find myself at odds. I want integration and the pennant. I want to punish Dixie and at the same time I want his salvation.It would be so much simpler if he wasn't batting .385. As Walker finishes, he passes Jack whose turn it is.Nevertheless it must be accepted calmly, Harold. What is it? A headline: PLAYERS STRIKE. Parrott reads...Madness! What are they thinking?!National League President Frick says this is America and baseball is America's game. He says one citizen has as much right to play as another.Because my job is to win. I have an obligation to Brooklyn to put the best team on the field I can. Your presence on the roster increases our chances of winning. Not buying it, Jack looks over at him.You look lovely, Mrs. Robinson.I don't know how you do it. Every day, from the 1st to the 9th. Myself? I could pay $100 for a suit and in twenty minutes I'd look like I fell out of bed. Even my shoes look rumpled. They watch Jack crack one high off the Schaefer Beer sign.Is that so?How did you two meet?Trying to catch her in a race. She was the fastest girl in town. Beautiful legs. I finally caught up; we've been together ever since. They sit a moment. Below: Jack nails another one.I wanted to apologize to you.Everything. I can't apologize to him. He and I both knew what we were getting into. But you. A newlywed, trying to blossom a marriage under all this pressure.Your husband has humbled me. When this all began I thought I was changing the world and that Jackie was my instrument. Can you imagine? I wish I could help him, but I'm just a spectator.Is he able to get things off his chest? So he doesn't burn up?Good. It's too much to carry inside. Does he have any friends on the team? They're spectators, too. They do admire him though. Rachel looks out to where Reese and Stanky play catch.Even the worst of us recognizes courage. Moral courage especially. I have to think they see it. Jackie's a man on trial. He's responding with glory and grace. No one can take their eyes off him.I suppose we all are. You're an astute woman, Mrs. Robinson.If I'd met you first, I wouldn't have looked so long for Jackie.I mean if he was good enough for you, he's certainly good enough for the rest of us.What can I do for you, Herb?Twenty years. Maybe more.And why's that, Herb? His name's Jackie Robinson by the way.Herbert, what your team does is your decision. But my team is coming to Philadelphia. With Robinson. If we have to claim the game as a forfeit, we will. That's 9-0 in case you forgot.Do you think God likes baseball? I do.It means you're going to meet God one day, Herb, and when he inquires why Robinson wasn't on the field in Philadelphia and you answer because he was a Negro, it may not be a sufficient reply. As Rickey hangs up the phone...What can I do for you, Pee Wee?It's an important road trip, we're only three games out of first.Cincinnati's nearly a home game for you.Nigger lover. Watch yourself. We will get you, carpetbagger. Typical stuff. Reese takes the letter back, a little hurt.How many of these letters have you gotten, Pee Wee?I'll tell you what they aren't, they aren't letters from the Jackie Robinson fan club. Here -- He thrusts a sheaf of it into Reese's hands. As Reese flips through the stack of hate, reads:Of course he knows. And the FBI. They're taking a threat in Cincinnati pretty seriously. So excuse me if I'm not too shocked at you being called a carpetbagger. You should be proud of it!I understand. I bet Jackie just wants to play ball. I bet he wishes he wasn't leading the league in hit by pitch. I bet he wishes people didn't want to kill him. But the world isn't so simple anymore. I'm not sure it ever was. We just, baseball ignored it. Now we can't.Coming up out of his seat along with the fans around him.Get out. Let me talk to my first baseman. Go. He's getting stitched up for Pete's sake. The reporters move off for other interviews. Reporter Two hesitant to let it go, finally drifts off. Rickey watches.Sticking up for yourself is what you'd expect of any man. Some find it galling to see it in a Negro.Sorry? Sorry for what?I told you, Jackie, all the best base runners get caught sometimes.Do you know what I saw this morning? I was passing a sandlot and a little white boy was up to bat. You know what he was doing?He was pretending he was you. Wiping his hands on his pants, swinging with his arms outstretched like you do. A little white boy pretending he was a black man.We had victory over fascism in Germany; it's time for victory over racism at home.I love this game. I love baseball. I've given my life to it. Forty odd years ago I was a player coach at Ohio Wesleyan University. We had a Negro catcher, best hitter on the team. Charley Thomas. Rickey starts slowly rubbing the baseball in his hands.A fine young man. I saw him laid low. Broken because of the color of his skin and I didn't do enough to help. I told myself I did, but I didn't. The game I loved had something unfair at the heart of it. I ignored it. But a time came when I could no longer do that.You're a force of nature, Jackie, you've complicated everything but yourself. You're changing the world, and refusing to let it change you. I for one am in awe. Jack reaches, takes the baseball from him. A beat as they consider each other. Finally, a promise...Rickey here.And eliminates the Giants and Boston. He puts an \u00e2\u0080\u0098X' through Boston and the Giants. The rest of the NL are already crossed out. Only the Cardinals remain. At the same time, Parrott X's the same out on his notebook.We'd have to lose nearly every game for the Cardinals to catch us now. One more win may do it.

Imagine the abuse you'll take from the newspapers alone. Never mind how it'll play on Flatbush. Please, Mr. Rickey.Jackie Robinson's on a bus leaving Pensacola.Maybe you could have Durocher hold a press conference. Demand that he get Robinson on his team.Get some glasses, ump!How's Florida, Burt?You'd better just talk to him. A beat as they reach the door. Parrott knocks.I'm going in that Phillie dugout tomorrow and wring Chapman's neck! Rickey considers Parrott, starts laughing. Parrott is hurt.Did I say something funny?Well, any decent minded person --A service?!The news isn't good, sir.A National League players' strike instigated by some of the St. Louis Cardinals against the presence of Negro first baseman Jackie Robinson has been averted temporarily and perhaps permanently quashed.Come on, fellas! We have twenty minutes to check in and then get to Shibe! Chop chop. No one is listening as the TEAM DRIVER opens the lower compartment and the players grab their bags.We're the Dodgers. We have a reservation.You mean Robinson can't stay here?We've been staying here ten years.Fellas! Burt! Please! Take the bus to the field! Worry about the game. I'll find another hotel.Jackie, excuse me, um, a request came in. The Phillies manager Ben Chapman, he'd like his photo taken with you. Jack pretends to sniff the air around Parrott.Mr. Rickey thinks it's a good idea. He says it'll be in every sports page in the country. An example that'll show everyone even the most hardened man can change.Mr. Rickey says it doesn't matter if he's changed. As long as it looks like he's changed. Chapman said he'd come down here. Or meet you in the runway. As Jack slow burns...We did it, Boss! We did it! We swept Cincinnati! That puts us seven games up.

The umpire passes one hand over the other: Safe. Jack looks over at the catcher, gives him a pointed look as he goes -- The catcher shoves him in the back. Jack turns, shoves back. As the two men wrestles each other to the ground --I'm going to the toilet.Take that hose out of the tank.Take it out. We'll get our ninety- nine gallons of gas someplace else. The attendant blinks. He takes a look from Jack to up and down the deserted highway. No business in sight.Excuse me?I think so.I don't make much money. Between the army and now baseball I've been away a lot. And Rae, Rachel, she wants to finish school. Considering all that, I say I think so.Yes, sir, very much.Coach Sukeforth here said you were starting a new Negro League. That doesn't make sense to me.What's this about, Mr. Rickey?Yes, sir. That's fine.My temper?Yes.Mr. Rickey, you give me a uniform, you give me a number on my back, and I'll give you the guts.Rae, I'm in Brooklyn.I don't want to say on the phone. In fact, I'm not supposed to tell anyone. She can hear the tingle in his voice.I'm here, RaeWe've been tested you and me. Our loyalty, our faith. We've done everything the right way. Me trying to make money. You finishing school. Separated by the war, now by baseball. We don't owe the world a thing. Only each other. She's actually getting a little scared now.The Brooklyn Dodgers just signed me to play ball up in Montreal. It might lead to bigger things. To something wonderful.Rae. Will you marry me?Now.Yes. They reach the door. Jack gets out a key to unlock it. Rachel looks nervous, steps back across the hall.Everyone looked happy. I've never seen so many people looking happy.Too late. You already do. It's you and me, Rae.It can wait one more nightI will, Mama. Mallie hugs Jack and then kisses Rachel.They have food on the plane, Mama.I couldn't tell her no.No one's going to mistake you for a bumpkin in this.The flight to Pensacola leaves in an hour... You okay?We're not in Pasadena anymore. A sudden momentum carries her forward.Honey... Rae -- He takes a step after her, stops as she disappears inside. Jack unsure what to do. He looks around. Looks back. He doesn't need this right now.I promised Mr. Rickey we'd stay out of trouble.Before I promised.Excuse me?No. You hang onto those. Mastering himself, Jack slides out. Drilling the cook with a look, he offers his hand to Rachel as she slides out as well.Just a hop to Daytona now. As Rachel nods, an AIRLINE EMPLOYEE boards, MISS BISHOP. She makes her way over. She spots who she's looking for.When's the next flight?Look, I'm with the Brooklyn Dodger organization. I've got to get down to Daytona. I'm supposed to report to spring training in the morning.You gave away our seats! Get us back on that plane! Miss Bishop picks up a PHONE, holds it in Jack's face.Mama knew... He holds it out to Rachel. She slides over, takes it, takes a bite as well, smiles at him. He smiles back.My who?It's a joke, right?I'll try to remember... As the kisses become more urgent...It's okay.If they ask something, I'll answer.Sure, I had no problem with white men in the service or at UCLA.I'll duck. That gets some laughs.Reese plays for Brooklyn. I'm worried about making Montreal.It's about getting paid. Jack doing beautifully. Smith breathes a sigh of relief...I'm just a ballplayer, Mr. Brock.No thank you, sir, I don't drink.Mr. Brock, do you have a desk? I'd like to get a letter to my wife.I was just getting loose. Smith sticks his head in the door.I wonder what he wants?What are you talking about? The man close now. As Jack cranks down the window, Smith floors it. The Buick SCREECHES away, SWERVING around a CAR coming the other way.What the hell, Wendell?!Why didn't you say so?I thought you woke me because I was cut from the team. Jack LAUGHS harder. Wendell LAUGHS as well. As it fades, Jack looks back over his shoulder. Jesus...What!? Why?You swing that thing you better hit me between the eyes with it.I said okay, Skipper, tell him... Ah'm a-gittin'. Sho'nuff, ah is.I did. Then I took a long shower. We lost 2 to 1. She takes a few exaggerated steps to amuse him.You're not getting away from me.Get back, Rae. Go back. Cracker stops square across from him. Jack's fists balled.Yeah, what's that?You wanted to see me, Mr. Rickey? Rickey nods, consider the field a moment.I like the way it smells when they mow it.I won't let you down.If you don't mind, I've got to go tell my wife.Why are you doing this, Mr. Rickey?I don't think what I believe is important. Only what I do.My daddy left. He left us flat in Cairo, Georgia. I was only six months older than you are now. I don't remember him. Nothing good, nothing bad. Nothing.When did I ever not write?Rae, you're in my heart. She sighs, rests her head on his shoulder.I will not. God built me to last. He kisses her. She kisses him back.It might be Montreal. A certainty grips her. She passes it on to him.I've got to go, Rae. She nods. They kiss, embrace a last time. He starts away down the walk. She watches. Something not quite right. A tug as Jack stops, looks back at her. Fighting back her emotion and then impelled forward, she runs to him. They come together. She practically disappears in his arms. They do not want to be apart.What do you want me to do with this?I've never played first base in my life, Coach.You again. Smith leans back, blinks.Come on. Jack continues past. As Smith follows...Do I have to entertain you? More silence, then...If I start talking, will you stop?I apologize. You've been there for me through this more than anyone besides Rae and Mr. Rickey. But I guess that's what bothers me.I don't like needing someone to be there for me. I don't like needing anyone but myself. I never have.You remember the last time we were at a red light? Down in Florida?And we got a long way to go. The light turns green. Off they go.Hello?This man does not. He stands bare chested in his boxers staring out the window of a MCALPIN HOTEL ROOM. Considering the world before him. Wondering where his place is in it. INSERT: April 15, 1947. 3 AM. It's a lonely moment. Until Rachel appears behind him in her nightgown. She wraps her arms around him, looks over his shoulder at the world out there. Finally, softly...No I don't.Black, white, we're both pink today, huh?That's fine. That's how I prefer it. Right out in the open.Walks toward the plate. More cheers. Mostly.I'm not complaining, I just, I don't know what they want.I'm not sure yet. It looks good.A fastball inside. He leaps back again. This one was even closer to hitting him. As Jack glares at Dutch...Grips the bat. Watches for the next pitch with bloody mindedness. He hacks at it, lofts a routine fly into left. He's about halfway down to first when the left fielder catches it and Jack can mercifully return to the dugout.Steps to the batter's box, starts digging in that back foot.Waiting for the pitch. Takes a mighty swing -- CRACKS a towering POP-UP between home plate and the mound. Dutch watches his catcher Seminick settle under it. Waiting.To hell with this. The next white son of a bitch who opens his mouth, I'll smash his goddamn teeth in. Rickey stands there until finally, opening his mouth...I'm supposed to let this go on?I have to live with myself, too! And right now I'm living a sermon out there. I'm through with it! Jack is at the end of his rope. All Rickey has are words.Is that so?Do you know what it's like, having someone do this to you?!And not a damn thing I can do about it.They're taking the field.I'm gonna need a new bat. As Jack heads back down the tunnel for the field.Steps into the batter's box. Chapman and his sidekicks step from the Stygian abyss of the visitor's dugout.You shouldn't have waited.Give these boys time. It's a three game series. A beat between them, framed by the steel girders around them.I don't care if they like me; I didn't come here to make friends. I don't even care if they respect me. I know who I am; I got enough respect for myself. But I do not want them to beat me.They're taking their best shot. I don't want you coming tomorrow. I don't want you to watch that, them beating me.I did good the day I met you.Thanks.Why are you doing this, Mr. Rickey?If this is winning, I'd hate to see us on a losing streak.What's your average, Joe?No matter how fast you run, you'll never hit as much as you weigh. Garagiola signals for another fastball.What is it, Rae?Don't worry. It's okay.I know. I'm sorry for that. Rachel squeezes his hand back.Yeah?It worked. I didn't hear a thing. She tries to smiles. As the tears streak her cheeks, he leans in kisses her forehead.They're just ignorant.Hold on.Long as we hold on, it'll be okay.What's that supposed to mean?What do you want from me, Walker?So am I! I'm here to win!It might do you some good the way you're swinging the bat lately.Watch your damn hand! And they're lunging at each other. Separated by Reese, Stanky, Branca and Bragan while other players hold off Shotton. Two fights about to break out at the same time.You been drinking, Harold?Chapman hasn't changed. He's just trying to take the heat off.You want a picture? Sure. Jack steps to the on-deck circle, grabs a BASEBALL BAT. Chapman's eyes widen as he starts toward him with it.We'll hold the bat. That way we don't have to touch skin. Chapman nods, looks relieved. A photographer hands over a bat. Chapman has two hands on the handle. Jack puts one hand on the barrel, the other stays on his hip.Ben, I hope all your friends back home like the picture. Jack smiles as the flashbulbs go off. Chapman looks dumb.What's up? Now cries of CARPETBAGGER! cut through. PEE WEE, HOW CAN YOU PLAY WITH THIS BLACK BASTARD!? Reese stares up at the worst hecklers along the first base line. He looks a little sad.Just a bunch of crackpots still fighting the Civil War.Better luck next time, Pee Wee. Reese impulsively puts his arm around Jack's shoulder, stares into the Cincy dugout.What're you thanking me for?Gin.The stadium electric as Jack steps in, his left leg bloody. He takes an inside pitch at the knees. Bastards! Here comes the next one. WHACK - He singles hard up the middle, nearly takes the pitcher's head off.I don't care what happens, I don't care what kind of play it is, when I get to second I'm gonna knock someone into centerfield.Bouncing up and down, wearing that badge of potential violence and action. The crowd buzzing, the electricity practically hits you in the face. Jack's going to score.Walker at bat. Jack steps out, checks on MARION the shortstop. He takes another step out, looks to Schoendienst.You saw the play. I had my foot inside the bag. He was out by a mile. But he kept coming.What are you asking me for then?I'm sorry, Mr. Rickey.I lost my cool out there. It probably cost us the game.I wasn't thinking. Rickey pulls up a chair sits across from him, leans in.Sitting on a fastball?Why are you doing this, Mr. Rickey?Why are you doing this? Come on now. A long moment between them. Finally, Rickey looks away.You're welcome.I won't get picked off second base again. Not this year.It's pop's last long road trip of the year, little man.I know. I won't.I'll be home in a week.Seriously?And what'll happen then? She clucks a 'hit' sound, makes an 'ahhhhhh' crowd sound.We win enough of these next games and we'll bring home the pennant.We got room right over there. Between number one and number two. She mock grimaces at his bad joke.Rae, you're in my heart.I promise.Come on, Casey, get him out! Pitch that ball!I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable.Give me something I can hit!I'm home.", "clean_line": "umpire passes hand safe jack looks catcher gives pointed look goes catcher shoves jack

When?Did my mom look happy?Did my gram look happy? Swinging the door open, he looks at her. The air charged.Did Jack Robinson look happy?Until the wheels fall off.I'd follow you anywhere, Mr. Robinson. He picks her up, carries her over the threshold. As the door clicks shut behind them...We will. She reaches in her bag, brings out a cardboard SHOEBOX; it's ever so slightly greasy at the bottom.I know she means well; I just don't want to be seen eating chicken out of a box like some country bumpkin. Jack runs his hand over her coat.Well, they'll know I belong on that plane or wherever I happen to be.I've just never seen one before.Did you promise him we wouldn't go to the bathroom? You've done it.It was just a toilet. You'd think the commodes were made of gold. The busboy watches as Jack and Rachel slide into a booth. As Jack reaches for a MENU, here comes the COOK.It's good.It's Rachel.First time. We have our problems in Pasadena, but not like this.Where are the other wives staying?I'm sure. Thank you. As Jack enters, Mrs. Harris starts back down.I like it. The love nest. She kisses him. He's starting to like it, too.Remind me dinner's at five.Jack's got a thick skin. He'll be okay.Who can blame them?You didn't?Ah'm a-gittin', ah'm a gittin'. He laughs, takes her hand. He's going to kiss her.I think I might be sick.I'm sick. I don't know why. The older woman rolls off a piece of paper towel for her.Thank you.I'm late.Emerging up the runway. The field opening up before her. There's Jack standing down there. The sight of him settles her. As she puts a hand gently over her belly...Oh, Jack... Oh Jack...Jack! Jack! INSERT: November 18, 1946. Pasadena, California. She is in labor and we are in Huntington Memorial Hospital. A CRY. The DOCTOR holds up a slick, wailing NEWBORN.Promise me you'll write.I want you to know I'm there for you. Even if it's words on paper. He's sees she's raw, takes her in his arms with the baby.You're getting close now. The closer you get, the worse they'll be. Don't let them get to you.See you in Brooklyn in eight weeks.It's going to be Brooklyn. I know it is. Power in her words. He nods, looks off toward the taxi.Hello?What did I tell you?I love you... As he closes his eyes, absorbs it...Watches from the stands. Pleased at the cheering. She holds the baby up to see, whispers to him...Okay, okay, that's good. As Jackie's eyes find hers...And me? I'm just young and scared and amazed at how brave you are. He grins at her, almost gets a forkful in when LAWSON BOWMAN, the Black owner, pulls up a chair, shakes Jack's hand.You're lucky you're a boy. DOORWAY - Dressed to go, Rachel holding the baby, looking anxiously out on the street. Suddenly, ALICE the baby-sitter is there. Here she comes up the steps, opens the door.It's okay. Rachel gently hands the baby over.It's so cold and raw out, I don't want him getting sick at the game.I'm going to be late. She kisses him goodbye, frowns as she heads outside --As the Dodgers take the field, Jack heads to first. Almost wincing, wondering if it's going to start again.Look at me, baby. Look at me. Finally, Jack glances up to her. She offers her eyes: I'm with you. He looks away. Her witnessing makes it worse.Sick for her husband.Witnessing.Steal it, sweetheart. Take it.They haven't made a day long enough that I wouldn't wait for you.They are never going to beat you.Wherever you are, I am, too. Look at me. Jack... He looks over. It's not easy for this most proud of men.I have to watch. So our hearts don't break... Plus I already bought a scorecard. She holds it up. His name the only one filled in.And I put your name on it. See? Jack Robinson. He puts his hand out, takes hers.Baby, you hit a home run.Oh Jack...Nothing. It's just, sometimes when I sit up there with those bastards, those loudmouths in the stands, I know you can hear them.No, it's not okay. And I can hear them, too. Jack looks at her, takes her hand in his.We're in it together. When they start in on you, you know what I do? I try to sit up as straight.Straight as I can.I got it in my head that I can block it from you, some of it, if I sit up straight. Isn't that dumb? Closing the space between them, he takes her hand.If they knew you, they'd be ashamed. She puts her arm around him, draws that strength.I am holding on.Thank you.I used to think Jack was conceited.It was the very first thing I noticed about him.I saw him at a UCLA football game. Even in uniform with a helmet on, his vanity was awful. It was the way he held his hands on his hips. I hated him!For what?Don't worry about me. Or us. We know who we are. Crack. Jack hits another.You help him plenty. Believe me. They watch him rip into another pitch.Yes. I have to let him have that silence at first, let him come to me. But he opens up eventually.Do you think so?He's had himself on trial since the day I met him. No man is harder on himself or gets to himself worse than Jack. But I hope his team- mates know, they're on trial too.How do you mean?Careful you don't wake him.I don't like seeing you leave, that's all. He looks at her a beat, resumes packing...Eleven days. That's a long time without you. He doesn't answer, packs away. Finally:Try not to lunge at the plate.That's why they're throwing the fastballs inside. He looks at her, a little shocked.Fight those inside fastballs off, foul them back. Sooner or later they won't be able to help but throw a curve. He steps to the bed, leans over her.Pennant? Where are we going to put a pennant? All these baby diapers hanging everywhere. Jack looks around the room, at the diapers hanging.Win one if you have to, but bring yourself home; that'll be plenty. They kiss.Promise me you'll come home. That you'll always come home. As he looks at all he loves in the world...Come on. Throw him a strike.Safe.Stay just like that. She kisses him. And kisses him.

Pittsburgh Courier. I'm going to be your Boswell.Your chronicler, your advance man. Hell, even your chauffeur. Mrs. Robinson.Man, you two look wiped out.You ever been down South before, Rachel?Mr. Rickey says we follow the law. If Jim Crow and the state of Florida say Negroes do this and that, then we do this and that.Joe and Duff Harris live here. He gets out the black vote, does a lot of good for colored folks.Mr. Rickey set it up himself.Brooklyn plays downtown; Montreal a few blocks from here. You'll stay with the Harrises except for a few days at the end of the week. The whole Dodger organization is going to Sanford, about 45 minute away. You'll stay here though, Rachel.There are no other wives. You're the only one Mr. Rickey allowed to spring training. As the HARRISES step out on the porch, wave hello...The first day of Spring Training. My Pittsburgh Courier readers need to know how it feels.That's not exactly a headline.Look, Jack, right now it's just me asking you. But you get on that field and it's going to be the New York Times and the Sporting News. You should think about it.Alright, but you know when you're at the plate, you want to feel like you see the pitch come in slow? Well, you want to see the questions come in slow, too. Jack just looks at him. Gets out. Smith sighs.Between his legs, good one. He must've read a joke book. If he can read. Jack just gets in the car. Smith sighs, drum rolls the hood of the Buick.Hi, Wendell, how are you...? Well, looks like I got a long drive to Sanford.I'll have one. I'm a stereotypical reporter through and through.Okay as far as I can see. A MIDDLE-AGED WHITE MAN, LUTHER exits the car and starts toward them.Who is it you're looking for?He's asleep. Maybe you better come back in the morning.Don't just sit there. Pack your duds. We're blowin'. A phone RINGS somewhere. They hear Brock answer, then:To run us out of town.Man came by while you were asleep.Mr. Rickey was afraid you wouldn't leave, that you would fight. As it becomes clear, Jack starts to LAUGH.What the hell are you laughing at?How about you?It's just a walk.You okay?I'd be sick at a swing like that, too.His hands resting on the top of his typewriter.Come on, Jackie. Come on, batter.Nearly drops his typewriter, pushes his hat back as he watches Jack start his home run trot. Smith laughs. Joy.Robinson jogged around the bases, his heart singing... The crowd loves it as he continues toward third where Sukeforth is clapping for all he's worth.And our own hearts beat just a bit faster, and the thrill ran through us like champagne bubbles...That's right. Me again. Something wrong with that, Jack?They can't keep you on Montreal for long. After these exhibition games, they've got to bring you up.You ever wonder why I sit out in right field with my typewriter on my knees? Does that ever cross your mind? Jack stares out the passenger window, not in the mood. As he looks up at some of the taller buildings they pass...It's because Negro reporters aren't allowed in the press box. Jack doesn't answer, doesn't look over. Finally Smith starts talking to himself. Pretending to be Jack.Why I'm from Detroit, Jack.My daddy used to work at Fair Lane. That was Mr. Ford's estate. My daddy was Mr. Henry Ford's cook.Cooked for him for years, but never once broke bread with him. I'd go to work with daddy sometimes. Play baseball out on the lawn with Mr. Ford's grandchildren. We all had a real good time. But it was understood, if they got tired of playing ball and moved inside to the bowling alley or swimming pool, I was not invited or allowed. The grass was as far as I got. So guess what? You're not the only one with something at stake here.I'd be happy to. Smith stops at a red light.How do you mean?You are a hard case, Jack Robinson. Is it okay if I keep driving you or should I let you out so you can walk? Jack bursts out laughing. So does Smith.New York City now, baby. We've come a long way.Eddie, what's all this talk about your Cardinals refusing to play?Hey, Garagiola --Hey, Stan, what's the story?St. Louis didn't win the world championship last year without using their heads. They have the same heads this year and should know that they can't pick the players of another club.See the ball come in slow. See the photo come in slower.Jackie leads Dodgers to victory. Again. Under that: white Italian guy does ok. They all laugh.Thirty-two and fifteen actually.

Sort out our differences! He hits another. This time to the outfield where veteran DIXIE WALKER gives chase, finally gives up on it.C'mon, Dixie, get after it!I'm gonna squeeze one more year out of that worn out body of yours!Keeping the women happy! That's what it's all about!Rusty, Mr. Rickey. But we'll get \u00e2\u0080\u0098em oiled up and ready in no time. You find your lost sheep yet? Troubled, Rickey shakes his head \u00e2\u0080\u0098no'. As he does, Harold Parrot hurries over. He's the Dodgers travelling secretary.He didn't come to play; he came to kill. Durocher starts out to the mound to talk to Higbe.Yeah?I'm bowling. Wait, I'm snowshoeing in the Alps. I'm trying to sleep, Mr. Rickey. It's still dark out.I don't got an attitude toward him. The girl rolls over to look at him. She is the actress LORRAINE DAY and she is stunning. As Durocher regards her...I don't know much about the Bible.But I didn't go to school just to eat my lunch either. I'll play an elephant if he can help us win. To make room for him, I'll send my own brother home if he's not as good.We're playing for money, Mr. Rickey. Winning's the only thing that matters. Is he a nice guy?Good. He can't afford to be. Nice guys finish last.None whatsoever. Can I go back to sleep now?What?I'm sure it's got a lot to say about a lot. Good night. Durocher hangs up the phone, looks to her.What am I gonna do with you?It's a pipe dream, Mr. Rickey.I mean it ain't gonna happen. The Dodgers are never gonna demand Robinson be brought up from Montreal. Ball players are conservative.It - ain't - gonna - happen.I'm not saying they won't accept him: I'm saying they won't ask for him. I'm saying Robinson's good medicine, but they're not gonna like the taste. I'm saying bend over, boys, and get ready, this one might hurt a little.Yes, Mr. Rickey.We are the only people awake on this entire isthmus, Mr. Rickey.Yes, Mr. Rickey.Wake up, ladies! Wake the Hell up! It's come to my attention that some of you fellas don't want to play with Robinson. That you even got a petition drawn up that you're all gonna sign. Well boys, you know what you can do with your petition?Come on what?!Screw your hardware store, Dix! And if you don't like it, screw you! Mr. Rickey'll be happy to make other arrangements for you. Durocher suddenly marches to Higbe, looks like he's going to belt him. As Higbe gulps, Durocher turns to the team.I don't care if he's yellow or black or has stripes like a zebra, if Robinson can help us win, and everything I've seen says he can, then he's gonna play on this ball club. Like it, lump it, make your mind up to it because he's coming! And think about this when your heads hit the pillow, he's only the first, boys, only the first. More are coming right behind him. They have talent and they wanna play! He lets that sink a moment.Yes, sir, they're gonna come diving and scratching. So I'd forget your petition and worry about the field. Because unless you fellas pay a little more attention to your work, they are going to run you right out of the ball park! A petition? Are you ballplayers or lawyers?

I got a wife, a baby, and I got no money. I don't want to step in anything.So let him show what he's got. Robinson can play or he can't. It'll all take care of itself.Opening day nerves. Doing my stomach something awful. Jack nods in commiseration. It's awkward between them. A RUMBLE as a GARBAGE TRUCK goes by.There goes another one.Know when I first heard of you?On a troop transport, coming back from Guam. A sailor heard it on the radio, told me the Dodgers had signed a Negro player. I said that was fine by me. Then he said the guy was a shortstop. Least you were then. That got me thinking. Thinking gets me scared. Jack smiles, hefts his bottle of Pepto.Of garbage trucks? Terrified.Well, Mr. Rickey, it's like this, the series in Cincinnati next week.Yes, sir. You know, I'm from Kentucky.I got this letter, sir. I guess some people aren't too happy about me playing with Robinson. Rickey is not liking where this is going; he motions for the letter, scans it, reads the highlights...It's not typical to me.Just this. Ain't that enough? Rickey looks Reese over a moment. Pushing back his chair he steps over to a filing cabinet.What are those?Get out of baseball, or your baby boy will die.Get out of the game or be killed. He looks at one more, reacts to the vitriol, but does not utter it. Reese looks back at Rickey, shocked.Does Jackie know?We'd just like to play ball, Mr. Rickey. That's all we want to do.They can say what they want; we're here to play baseball.Hell, we'd a won that son of a gun if the cornstalks had held out. We just ran out of ammunition. Jack laughs. Reese has a funny way of saying it.Ain't gonna be a next time. All we got is right now. This right here. Know what I mean? Walker reacting out in right. The crowd shuts down, some in shock at the gesture. Jack surprised also.Thank you, Jackie.I've got family here from Louisville. Up there somewhere. I need \u00e2\u0080\u0098em to know who I am.Playing ball, ump! Playing ball!I'd call your folks for ya, Ralph. Tell \u00e2\u0080\u0098em how you did.We are on some kind of winning streak, huh boys? And I don't mean cards.This next series against the Cardinals, it's a big one. They look over at Jack who hasn't said a word. It's his play. He lays his cards down.
