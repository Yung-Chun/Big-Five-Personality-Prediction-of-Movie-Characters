{"Whos-Your-Daddy": {"TED": {"raw_line": "...But a lot of clich\u00e9s get to be clich\u00e9s because they're true. Your life CAN change in the blink of an eye. What I mean is, one day you're a regular chump, a wannabe something. You're not even totally sure WHAT you wannabe......The next day the doorbell rings and some stranger's holding your ticket to being SOMEBODY.It happens every day. Dreams come true. And not just for those dim witted chain-smoking hillbillies you see on TV. You know, the ones who win the Super Lotto and spend their fortune on a truck full of Goobers and a new set of front teeth. It could happen to any guy, any time...even ME.Uh, that's not me. I'm over here.You're disappointed, I know. I admit, I was hopeless back then. The 'do, the shades, ugh. But I always had good taste in women.That's Christy Malone. Head cheerleader, love of my life, lust of my loins.Look at that smile. That wink. That's no platonic wink. That's a wink that says, \"I don't just want you, Ted. I NEED you.\" So of course I had to ask her to the prom. I mean, she was practically begging for it.I've been looking for you, too.From your lips, to God's ears.Yeah?Yeah?SHUT UP! Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.Sorry about that. A cheap trick, I know. But it's my story and my fantasy. So cut me some slack.You and your pep talks.That's Charlie. My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer......a very gifted photographer.The senior class voted him, \"Most Likely To Have A Restraining Order Filed Against Him.\" But that's another story.I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.See? Did you see that?Were you always this sick?Someday, I'll find out.I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.I defy any and all limits.Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.There's one more person you should meet. Someone integral to my story.That's Julie Conroy. Unlike the rest of these losers, she didn't grow up in Xenia, Ohio. I just met her that day. But already, she had made a difference in my life.Merk's punishment was cruel. Expulsion without appeal. Or working for me on the school paper. The school paper would be torture for a gonzo reporter like Julie and we both knew it. But what choice did she have?That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning expos\u00e9 changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.Look, I loved \"Exposed!\" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.Me-ow.I have absolutely no intention--So you see, this is really about a triple-dog-dare. I don't even know what it means. I just know, unless it's a felony, a triple-dog-dare pretty much has to be met with immediate action.Uh, Christy, I was wondering...You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.But that smile.So you'll think about it?So that's a maybe?In my dreams. Of course. This is a dream. This is only a dream.But you triple-dog-dared me.There's gotta be more to life than meatloaf.If I never eat another bite of meat loaf again, it'll be too soon.Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!It's my private business! Mine!I hate Xenia! I hate my life!And until that moment, this was the worst day of my seventeen and a half years. And then it happened. Three, two, one...Whoa! Sorry, mister.I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?People pay good money for that?Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.My parents? What do you mean?You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?Dad, please.Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.You guys are my parents.They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care...Well, why should I?I guess.Yeah.I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.Like one of those \"National Geographic\" specials with the topless chicks?I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face....not the pit.Poor Freud, turning in his grave.Nobody knows about your mental retardation.Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.I think I'll reinvent a new best friend.Astronomical.Hi, I'm Ted Nelson.Well, Dad said...Maybe he got promoted.Don't. Touch. Anything.Cut it out, before you break something!We can't afford that!Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.Nice. Is that in the limo etiquette handbook, too?You're on the next plane home.I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.Perv.Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.Of course I like girls.As much as possible.Seldom? No kidding?Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?Be cool. Fake it if you have to.This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.Not ever. Never.I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.You kiss your mother with that mouth?So far away? In Xenia?I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.Yeah, I'm doing fine. I have so much to tell you. I don't even know where to begin.It's okay, Mom. Trust me.Just say it, Dad.Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.I better go, Dad.What is it now?Don't tell me. Another vision of incomparable beauty?I get it now. You and me. We're dead.Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.And some really fast cars.It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...Oh, how inappropriate is that!How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?Give me those!We were just--Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.I-I don't have the keys.I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.Got it.I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.Some of them have to be automatics.I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.The one with the horses.I almost didn't recognize you without...you know...that stallion between...your...uh...legs.That sounded so much better in my head.Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.Hi ho, Silver.Sorry, habit.What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.I always knew there was more. I felt it.I'll take the whole case.I like her.Tipping?Yeah. Everything's cool.Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.Truth is, I'm a little nervous.All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.I do?Me? The King of Coitus?Whoa. But...that's the thing... I've never even actually...The Potentate of Poon has arrived.I was like a different person tonight.I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.Really? You'd do that for me?You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.My parents always say hard work builds character.What kind of ideas?You think we should be more open minded?In other words, our scope is too narrow.That's perfect.Who's your daddy?I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part. For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.They tell me I've got my father's taste in women and cars. The faster, the better.And I'm really looking forward to the challenge of bringing \"Heaven\" magazine into the 21st century.Well? Surprised?Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from.Only the best for my mother.I'll make you very proud.Thanks, Principal Merkin.Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.Have you ever even looked at \"Heaven?\"I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?Yeah? You like?It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.Your article sucked.In the sense that there is no \"hidden agenda\" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.I'm trying to help.That's not ENTIRELY true.What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up.Me?Really? You wanna write about me?Absolutely...heavenly.Finally, some gratitude.You don't have to work another day in your lives.Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.You're free. You can do anything you ever wanted to do!Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.Forget the store. Think big.I have to admit, I always felt... different.I don't get the distinction.I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.I guess.No thanks. I prefer my penis at room temperature.You never know around here.Don't write that part.Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.Funny you should say \"peachy.\"My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor, you are extremely cavalier.See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.A little respect would be nice, that's all.Well? What do you think of her?You're implying she's, what, a gold digger?Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.Why can't you be nice to me?Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols.Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of \"beauty.\"Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, \"The Girls of Xenia.\" Just to show my appreciation.With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others. Ever hear of the First Amendment?If that were true, this would be one seriously constipated town. Most guys in Xenia have been looking at naked girls in \"Heaven\" since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress.I wouldn't want to name names, Mr. Needleman, or cause any undue embarrassment. But many members of this community have been loyal \"Heaven\" readers for the better part of the last two decades. Not to mention certain charter subscribers who have developed a voracious appetite for our video library as well. I don't suppose, \"Courtney Leaves The Convent\" rings a bell to anyone?Hello there...Looking great...Very nice.Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.It better not be my Aunt Trudy.Sorry to keep you waiting...Christy? You want to be in \"Heaven?\"I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.Really? So I'm doing OK?My father must've been amazing.It's okay. You need me?No problem, consider it done. I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?I promised I'd finish high school and that's what I'm doing. What more do you want from me?THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.Why don't you just admit what this is really all about? I'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore.No wonder I was so bored. No wonder I hated this one-horse cow town. I come from talented people who took chances and dared to imagine a life without limits! I was never meant to be raised by...GROCERS.Hmmm?Whatever you want.Wow...you clean up nice.Of course we were.Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.Come on, it's our only senior prom.What's your price, Merk? How much will it cost to make you go bye bye?A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.What do you want me to do?Hang in there, I'll think of something.I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.I thought I loved her.Everybody, listen up! This prom sucks! Let's party at my place!Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?You called the cops on us?Where are we going?I can't believe your dad built this for you.Whatever.He cared enough to want you to have it.I see.Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?I mean my father.It's all so complicated.I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.And then what?You're amazing.Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything.In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.He shut down your paper! You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...I have a great idea. Let's lose the last button.Get them together.I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.Seriously? I'm doing all right?I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to say...you can't change your Christmas past, but you sure can exchange your Christmas presents.I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books. Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.James, what are you doing here?Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?It's really late...do your parents know where you are?Most places are, Jimmy.So, what brings you here at his hour?Very funny.My room?It's not up to me.You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.You want it in writing?That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.Are they okay?I miss them, too.You're a peach.He was my Grandfather, too.That's a crappy thing to say.I didn't forget.Loud and clear.That's probably my office.He's on the move?Let's do it.I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.That has more to do with your proximity to me.I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.What about you?Tell me more.I see.A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very \"Cosmo.\"Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.Do you trust me, Julie?Come on.I want you to trust me.Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.But absolutely true.We just found the ULTIMATE centerfold for \"The Girls of Xenia!\"I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.You're quick. I like that.The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.I do? I mean, yeah, I do.Do it?I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.That was code for \"I like you.\"I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.You have changed since second grade.You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.God help me.You're doing just fine, Christy. Believe me.Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.God, you are so hot.I'm sorry, Christy. I've been crazy about you forever, and this is definitely a page right out of my palm pilot, but I just can't go through with it.Wait, Julie, wait!At least let me explain!Please believe me. It was just a kiss for old time's sake. I've had a stupid crush on her since I was seven, but I never got closer to her than four feet and then there she was right in front of me, completely naked.Yes?We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.It won't happen again. It will never happen again.I always thought I wanted fame and fortune and beautiful women. But sometimes your dreams come true, and they cause you nothing but grief. I just want to chuck everything and sell the stupid magazine. It's not worth the pain.You mean they knew who I was?I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.My legacy.They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.And the girl I love, she hates \"Heaven.\" If I keep it, she'll never respect me.Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.I need your help. I'm really in deep shit.--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!My job. Back off, Benedict.The only man I called \"Dad\" owns a little grocery store in Xenia, Ohio. He learned a lot of cool stuff from my Grandpa, who was a peach farmer in his day. Grandpa knew the right thing to say in every situation, and it usually involved peaches. My dad's a lot like him. And he taught me, you have to focus on the peachy side of life, not the pits.There was a time when canned peaches were the hottest, greatest thing ever invented. It was like a little taste of summer, anytime you wanted. Grocery stores couldn't keep them in stock, they were so popular. And even though other canned fruits like pears, plums, and pineapples have come along, people still need to know they can get their canned peaches, on the same shelf, whenever they want them. It's comforting, you know? It fulfills their expectations.You're probably wondering if there's a point to all this and I guess it's just that I goofed last month. I not only moved the canned peaches, I restocked the shelves with kiwi, guava, and mandarin oranges in heavy syrup. I challenged people's expectations. And you can't do that to your customers. So, I ask you for one more chance to fix things and give our readers back their canned peaches.Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.\"One can only hope that Ted Nelson will find bigger and better dreams upon which to set his sights as the years pass. And that he will remember, always, where he came from.\"Great.Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.I decided to let Helen run the magazine. I need to go to college, learn a few things, you know.And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a \"coxswain.\"The thing is, I'll need a first mate.Julie, you were right. All the naked girls in the world mean nothing. It's the one you want to cover up with your coat that you really love.I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called \"EXPOSED!\" An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.Yellow pages?They're playing our song. Dare I ask for this dance?So, as you can guess, everybody pretty much lived happily ever after. My parents didn't give up the grocery store......but they did manage to sneak away for a second honeymoon.Merk's appearance in \"Heaven\" turned out to be a good thing. He was spotted by a talent scout......and went on a European summer tour, fulfilling his lifelong dream. Naturally he brought Poochie, the only girl he ever really loved.After graduation, Charlie moved to Utah......where he married all three of the identical Taylor Triplets. Let's just say, they've been very busy...And even Uncle Billy landed on his feet.And now if you'll excuse me, I think I'll get back to being the coxswain on the ship of life.", "clean_line": "lot

Don't knock it till you tried it.One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked.You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.That's crazy talk.Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.I'm warning you. This is an official warning. Danger, Will Robinson, danger.One word, my friend. One word. MEATLOAF.I wonder if this is what it feels like to be born?Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.And nobody knows you're a virgin! Aw, who are we kidding......EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU'RE A VIRGIN!What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?Who the hell was your father?...A bouncer? Are you serious?This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight.Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.This is how the other half lives, bro. Enjoy it while you can.Something tells me we're not in Xenia anymore, Toto.I'm Charles. The handsome, devoted best friend. We're so close, we feel each other's pain.See what you do to me, baby.He never spits, ma'am. Ever. He can't even get a good hocker going. I've tried to teach him. It comes from the diaphragm.Everything? The publishing division, the real estate holdings, the retail outlets, the theme parks?I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.He likes them with the unbridled enthusiasm of a seventeen-year-old virgin who's been making mental beef jerky since he saw the bevy of tender young skirt steaks at his new hacienda.You said parties but you meant ORGIES, right? Stick with me. I know their codes.Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called \"Heaven.\"This is like my every wet dream come true. I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.Oh, god. Look. Look.I really love your peaches, wanna shake your tree.Oh baby, yes, yes, yes. Fuck me like you mean it.I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...Yeah, whatever.Check this out. Hurry!Hurry.Check it out!Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.Dead?Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.I'd feel like staying up all night! Forever! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK....where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.Cha-ching. Jackpot.Take a whiff of heaven.I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different. She wasn't your mother mother--A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.Let me get this straight...These are real, live women?God, I love being dead.Ain't life amazing? A week ago, you couldn't get to second base! Now you OWN second base!We reinvented ourselves.You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.Jealousy is so unattractive.Wanna see my hickey from Miss December?Call me Charlie. I'm a photographer for \"Heaven\" magazine. And a very cunning linguist.Sharp as a mashed potato sandwich.Oh wow, look...they've even got baby gherkins!You're like a centerfold waiting to happen. And let me assure you, I have some serious pull with the publisher.Send us a picture, sugar. We'll get back to you.You're late, bro!You'll never believe who's in there.With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.Here's the deal, Merk. Forget the \"rules and regulations\" malarkey and we'll give you seven minutes in heaven with the Taylor Triplets.I hear you, bro. We're Angus men in a ground round town.Why don't you just hitch a ride on the horse you rode in on?Don't forget your broom!Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.Take your pick. They're IDENTICAL.No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.I love those springy head puppies!Brilliant! Molly, give me all you've got. For Merk.Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold.Page three.He kicked major ass and you know it.You were born naked, wet, and hungry. Now you're hip, handsome, and rich. You are the coxswain on the ship of life.I taught him that.You got everything you ever wanted.I'm a sucker for a happy ending.

Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.--Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.No, Ted. This is an actual emergency.I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way.He reinvented himself into a dick.What gives, Don Corleone?New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.That explains the emptiness that haunts me.Second only to unfettered arrogance and the inability to see the irony therein.A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?In what sense?Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.Oh, right. You're probably not a virgin anymore. But as far as being a hack, that much is status quo.Then I'll write about YOU.\"Local boy inherits more money than god.\" Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.No offense, Wolfgang Puck, but dead flesh is dead flesh. This just happens to be better than most dead flesh on the planet.Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.Interesting.She said peanuts, you cretin.Is this an gritty expos\u00e9 or a candy ass press release?Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.Money can't buy respect, Ted. Saying what you mean. Meaning what you say. Being an honorable person. That's how you earn respect.You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.You've got enough people kissing your ass.The Girls of Xenia? Jesus.Isn't it true, Principal Merkin, that you only care now because \"Heaven\" is suddenly too close to home?Oops, sorry. Warning: You've got lipstick on your teeth.Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.Need a lift?To the best hiding place in the world.He didn't. He had it built.Not \"whatever.\" It's two different things.He phoned it in.I doubt it.The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.Your dad taught you everything.A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.It's incredibly simple.Eventually you'll let go.Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.I know.But you never do.Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.That's two words. And I'm out of the \"exposed\" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.See what I mean. He's squeaky clean. He makes Gandhi look like a war monger.Well? Where the hell are you?I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?Amen to that.I'm trembling with excitement.My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.Wearing them? Or humping them?That's refreshingly deviant.I'm very aural.Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.Not a chance.Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.Maybe someday.That's hard to believe.I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise \"The Girls of Xenia.\"I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.Which explains the continued success of \"Heaven\" for how many decades?You think you're working with chimps here?Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted.What's up, doc?Go away, Ted. Just go.Being naked is no big deal. It has nothing to do with emotion, nothing to do with love. You can be around all the naked girls you want and you won't be even one step closer to anything meaningful in your life.See that? You don't know me even one ounce better than you did before. You and your stupid magazine. I liked you better when you were sweet and kind and human, like the rest of us.\"It's easy to fall prey to petty jealousy when considering the young life of Ted Nelson. But how would any of us behave if one day all our dreams came true? Would we handle it half as well? Would we find ourselves making the same mistakes for which we criticize him?\"Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.And who might that be? Miss July? Miss August?I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.Very ambitious. I like that.I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.Let your fingers do the walking.You better.", "clean_line": "william randolph big scoop contrasted popularity rice crispie treats chocolate snickerdoodles annual bake sale let guess retail sales little chocolate sprinkles gone roof true ignorance bliss tell hot miss titty pom poms know gave best lip gloss retention blow job ahead ask prom triple dog dare ted actual emergency tried warn william randolph got stiletto heels hidden keds good twisted sort publicly humiliating way reinvented dick gives corleone new hushpuppies new man explains emptiness haunts second unfettered arrogance inability irony billion bucks suddenly cro magnon man year william randolph balls need scratching sense ah ha hidden know died king publishing world mean ounce smarter week ago better changed decimal point savings account oh right probably virgin anymore far hack status quo ll write local boy inherits money god crazy smell human offense wolfgang puck dead flesh dead flesh happens better dead flesh planet different different like dwarf basketball game different like lesbian pumps everybody tell different knew like tight rope walker secretly wants trapeze artist interesting said peanuts cretin gritty expos\u00e9 candy ass press release life peachy planet ted homework grandfather peach farmer undoubtedly aristocratic bartender sort bet lots lots mirrors planet ted time private jet quit acting like rebecca sunnybrook farm money buy respect ted saying mean meaning honorable person earn respect twitterpated miner hat pickax second unbridled narcissistic conceit ve got people kissing ass girls xenia jesus isn true principal merkin care heaven suddenly close home oops sorry warning ve got lipstick teeth eyeballs head william randolph assignment girl fit need lift best hiding place world built different things phoned doubt ozone fully depleted planet ted dad taught father sperm ted takes real man dad incredibly simple eventually ll let ll holding know cut chase william randolph audience way ahead words exposed business remember need graduate merk boy scout forget dislike good journalist lemons lemonade honing craft mean squeaky clean makes gandhi look like war monger hell got anonymous tip address cincinnati expected whips chains merk cattle prodded dominatrix leather hood amen trembling excitement desire betrays like goosebumps flesh figured hairy armpit guy wearing humping refreshingly deviant aural sounds voices music humming turn like switch portuguese boyfriend read phone book melt live learn realized important thing trust lose trust gone forever chance trust earn time inherit overnight like gazillion dollar empire maybe someday hard believe honest ted despise girls xenia mean pictorial bothers profoundly telling aroused roomful naked breasts explains continued success heaven decades think working chimps keeping word actually respect ted doc away ted naked big deal emotion love naked girls want won step closer meaningful life know ounce better stupid magazine liked better sweet kind human like rest easy fall prey petty jealousy considering young life ted nelson behave day dreams came true handle half making mistakes criticize bad hack future yellow journalism miss july miss august going ted champagne wishes caviar dreams ambitious like know number naked girls love hop board planet ted years happening know excellent editor chief let fingers walking better"}}}
