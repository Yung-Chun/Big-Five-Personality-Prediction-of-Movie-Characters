Can you feel the buzz? The city is pulling you in. The city of light. The city of diabolical promise. The city of answered prayers. thru thru... And it begins on a rainy night, only a few months ago.Our hero, Sherman McCoy, was about to make a simple phone call. And despite the existence of eleven telephones and seven different lines in the fourteen rooms of his six million dollar plus apartment, this was a phone call he could not make at home.She was right, of course. And Sherman knew it. Christ. How could he have been so stupid? A simple phone call... DISSOLVE TO:The next morning, Judy's words were still ringing in his ears. Cheap. Rotten. And a liar. Alright. But was it really his fault. In a way she had brought it on herself, hadn't she? He intercepts Campbell at the foot of the stairs.On the lifecycle again. You see? Like all those other women she spends so much time with. So drawn, so pale. You could see lamplight through their bones...He was still a young man, in the season of the rising sap. He deserved more than these... these ... social X-rays. And she was turning into one of them!Dragging themselves to their sports training classes, they keep themselves so thin, they look like X-ray pictures. Sports-trained to death.Sherman was a master of the universe. He deserved better.The roar enveloped him. Music to his ears. The sound of educated young white men baying for money on the bond market. Six hundred million in his hands. Six million off the top for Pierce & Pierce. One point seven million for Sherman. All in a day's work. He was there. At the top -- impervious, untouchable, insulated by wealth and power. A great height from which to view the rest of the poor world. A great height from which to fall. 36A ANGLE - FAX MACHINE 36A * SPITTING OUT the message: \"Sherman, Arriving New York * on the Concorde tonight. Best, Maria.\" * EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - NIGHTOf course, up to this point in our story, I was blissfully ignorant. I had no idea of the storm that was gathering. Never even heard of Sherman McCoy. Hadn't the faintest notion that soon his name would be inexorably tied to mine. That his fate would be inextricably bound to my own destiny.I had my own problems. And I simply had no idea that Sherman McCoy was the solution I was looking for. 105 ANGLE - CAROLINE HEFTSHANK AND FILIPPO CHIRAZZI 105 *Caroline. You devil. Come and have a drink with us.Yes. And a very pretty someone he is, too.Enchante. We're a little crowded.Why don't you squeeze in next to Billy Cortez. Billy, you keep your hands to yourself. Now, Filippo, you sit down on top of Billy and I'll see if I can get Caroline to sit down on my face.Gerald. Well. Hello.Yes. Evelyn. How are you?Gerald, have a drink. Please, I can explain.Ah. Yes. Well...Incroyable!I see. Yes. Yes, of course. Well, I am on to something right now... and I think I've got... it's just a matter of... this is something that is really going to break open! Moore just looks at him. Then...It was the end of the road for me. I could see it coming. See it coming? Christ, it was here!I'd had my chance and I'd blown it away in a bottle. It was over. And I had to face up to that fact. 108 INT. FALLOW'S BEDROOM - PETER - MORNING 108 *I could always go back home. Small town, small newspaper. Or I could take the time off, write a novel or two. Or I could slit my wrists. This last suggestion actually seemed the most appealing because, in fact, it required the least amount of effort. The TELEPHONE RINGS.And then the telephone rang. He answers.Hello? Peter Fallow speaking. CUT TO: INT. LIMOUSINE - ALBERT FOX - MORNINGUh... yes.No. No. No. No. No. Thanks. No. Fox's Assistant approaches. They all move toward the exit. *Well, yeah, but... Look, it's an unfortunate situation. But I'm not altogether sure there's a story in it.I see. Yes, but what's your interest exactly?My situation?I see. 114F INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT 114FDo you have a daughter?Does she have a little toy wagon?I'll have a Scotch and water. *He was a student of yours at Ruppert High. In your English class.He was seriously injured. I'm a journalist. I write for a newspaper.What I would like to find out is what kind of student he was.Would you say he was a 'good' student?His mother says he was considering going to college.Well, is there anything at all you can tell me about his performance or aptitude -- anything at all?Fallow.Do you have any of his written work?Well, there must be some record of how he measures up to the others...Well, by that standard, is Henry Lamb an honors student?But it was too late. It was gone. Six hundred million dollars. On Wall Street, a frantic salesman was a dead salesman. And Sherman knew it. He puts down the phone and stares at the newspaper. He sits there in his two thousand dollar Saville Row suit and his New and Lingwood cap-toed shoes and he sweats. Around him, voices come out of the chaotic room. VOICE #1 Feds buying all coupons! Market subject! VOICE #2 Holy fucking shit. I want out! I want out!! 128 OMITTED 128 *Peter Fallow, from City Light.Where are all the people?Peter Fallow, City Light. CORSARO * Oh, you're the reason we're up in this godforsaken place. You and your little newspaper article.Sorry about that.Look, Reverend, aren't you afraid we may be trying to make a mountain out of a mole hill here? I mean, honestly...Well, I am a journalist...I think maybe you've got the wrong man, here.Oh. Yes. Sure. Yes. CORSARO * I mean this Henry Lamb is... was ... is a nice kid. No record, neighbors seem to like him, an honor student.No question about it. CORSARO * Because, well, I don't give a shit, but he's gonna be a saint by the time we get through with him. So it would be good if it were true. You know?Excuse me, Mister McCoy?You don't know me but I'm... But Peter is buried in the onslaught before he can say another word.It was too much for me. All of it. Sherman McCoy had been swept away from me. Before I could even speak to him. And as the day progressed, I began to appreciate the power, the magnitude of the force that had been unleashed by my little story.Jackels. Dogs. Yapping at the heels of their prey. And I was one of them. Well, let them have it. Enough is enough. I was finished. I summoned what little dignity I had left and decided to go home...Jesus Christ.Yes. I know. I know that. What are you...?You need to get out of here.This way. Come on.Me either. Especially on a first date. But we don't really have a choice. They enter the subway.Are you alright?Look, I owe you an apology...You don't know who I am.Go where?Look. Sit down. Just sit down a minute. I'll get you home. *Would you like a drink? I happen to have a little something...Go on. Fuck it. What are they going to do? Arrest you?Not in a million years.Yeah. But he didn't live in the * South Bronx. Did he? *You look like shit. And you smell, too.Take it easy.Yeah.It's okay. Have another drink.This is you. You'll be right on Lexington Avenue.You're not important. You're just dinner. You know what I mean? And a week from now, a month -- nobody is even going to remember what they ate.How do you mean?What?!Wait a minute! Wait a minute!That same evening, just a few blocks away, I was being praised and congratulated. It should have been a very triumphant yours truly at Leicester's. But it wasn't.... my little encounter with Sherman McCoy was spoiling everything. The truth has a way of doing that.Where's the phone?Don't tell me I'm finally going to get into your panties.Listen, Caroline. I'm sort of with some people tonight.Yes. Yes, I do. Franco or Federico...Caroline, you're absolutely soused.Caroline, isn't that dangerous? Or at least unsanitary?You're joking.But how do you know all this?You don't know where they are?Arthur. Thanks for meeting me on such short notice.Yes. We've never met but I'm a good friend of... your wife.Yes. Uh... where is Maria, by the way?Uh, yes. And we're doing a little profile piece. We're calling it the 'New Tycoons.' And, naturally, we thought of you.Oh, there's no hurry. So Maria is in Italy. Where abouts?Well, there are some great hotels in Lake Como. Is she at the Excelsior?I'd like to talk to her, too. If I could. If I could get in * touch with her... *Yes.Arthur? Arthur?Excuse me. Hello? Excuse me. Waiter!!! The Maitre d' approaches the table.Mr. Ruskin seems to have suffered some kind of -- well, I don't know.I think you'd better call someone.Well, somebody has to do something. Peter tries to perform the Heimlich maneuver on Ruskin.Jesus.What?Mrs. Ruskin?My name is Peter Fallow. I just wanted to offer my sympathy.Ah, well, yes. I was actually quite close to him when he died.You shouldn't.Yes. Just one other thing. I understand you're a friend of Sherman McCoy.Yes. I gather you were not only in the car with him when he had his unfortunate accident in the Bronx. But I understand you were driving.I was hoping you might tell me exactly what happened that night.Fallow.Look, don't you understand? It is very possible that Sherman McCoy was not driving that car. And I can almost prove it.The hospital?! What are you talking about?Alright, alright. But Christ, Albert, this is a great story. This is my exclusive. And it's also the truth!I can't just drop this now. I can't just let it go.So I printed their little story. Well, why not? Why not be the best whore in the house? And anyway, I was beginning to see even greater possibilities in my situation. The shades are drawn; the room is dark. Weiss sits at his desk. Andriutti and Kramer are with him.Mr. Leach?I understand you been doing some creative wiring in this building. Peter and Leach continue talking.In less than three minutes, I had what I was looking for. It was more than a story. I had the makings of a book here. A great book. A prize winning effort. All I needed was a big finish.So I shipped off a little present to Sherman McCoy's lawyer and I waited for the fireworks... 262C 262 thru thruAnd there it was. The end of Sherman McCoy. And it wasn't the * ending I was hoping for. He was * finished. She might as well have put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. There was no hope now. The darkness closed in around him. And then I noticed the most peculiar thing. Sherman was smiling.Oh, sorry. I'm Peter Fallow. I'm Peter Fallow. Ha. Ha. Ha.Thanks. I needed that. ANGLE - SHERMAN AND JUDGEIt was the last I saw of Sherman McCoy...And so we come to the end of our story. Sherman, you see, who started with so much, lost everything. But he gained his soul. Whereas I, you see, who started with so little, gained everything... DISSOLVE TO: thru thruBut what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses ... Ah, well. There are compensations. Peter reaches the podium and faces a standing ovation. Cameras begin to flash. END CREDITS BEGIN.

Let's not lose our composure over a few hundred million dollars.Just remember, Rawlie. A frantic salesman is a dead one. A dead one, Rawlie. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYI need six hundred million to buy up the bonds...I'm confident on this, Gene. It's a real sleeping beauty. A THROTTLED ROAR comes out of the SPEAKER.What do you say, Gene. Are we in or out?Bernard Sachs is already in for * three hundred million. Does that make you feel better?A rich old man, Gene. A rich old man. Another ROAR of the CROWD comes over the SPEAKERS.I guess you had to be there. Eh, Gene?At ease, gentlemen. The meeting breaks up.I had to talk to you. I did the most stupid thing last night.Yes.

If we keep our heads, we'll be perfectly fine.It looks like...I think it's a...It's a wheel, that's all. It's a tire.Calm down, Maria. Please. It's a tire and some ash cans or something. Sherman starts to get out of the car.Well, I can't drive around it, can I?Yes. That's exactly what I'm going to do.No thanks. Hi. No, I don't think so. No. Thank you very much. Sherman is confused. He doesn't move. Maria gets behind the wheel of the car. Roland reaches slowly into his jacket pocket. He smiles and keeps moving toward Sherman. Sherman sees the hand moving out of the jacket pocket. He is still frozen. Maria BLOWS the HORN. Sherman wakes up finally.Excuse me. I have to go.Oh. Is this yours? Here. You take it. Sherman pushes the tire toward Roland. Roland pushes it back at him. Sherman throws up his arms. The tire bounces off his arms and knocks Roland down.Oh. Sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... ANGLE - MARIA HONKS the HORN again and drives the car toward Sherman. ANGLE - SHERMANLook out! ANGLE - ROLANDBe careful. There's... But before he can say it, a loud, dead sound -- THOK! Sherman looks back...I wonder if we should report this to the police.I mean we were almost robbed and I think maybe it's possible you... we hit one of them. There was this kind of... There was this sound. Did you hear it? Like we hit one of them.No.But if we called the police now...Meteorites?Yes. You have a point.I'd just feel better if... Maria drops everything and turns on him...It's true. We could have been killed.You drove the hell out of that car.It was instinct.He was big... wasn't he?We were both great.I don't know. I still think...We should move out here.Have you ever thought, I mean, what if we moved out of New York? What do you think?Do you think we could leave New York?My father did it.Nothing. I... uh... no, nothing special.A bond is a way of lending people money. Let's say you want to build a road or a hospital and you need a lot of money. Well, you issue a bond...No, I don't actually build them... MR. McCOY I think you're in over your head. More laughter.Crumbs? Really...Well, you can call them crumbs if you want to...Yes. Well... MR. McCOY Now it's not about anything, is it? Except the money.I don't make the rules.We're having a little... It's nothing serious. Really.I think you're exaggerating the situation, Bernard...... The franc is no problem. We can hedge that to next January or to term or both.No. I don't think that's necessary... And then shock as Sherman recognizes...Look, Bernard... uh, we've had a few minor -- hell, they're not even problems. So let's not get ourselves whipped up into a-a-a coma. Jesus Christ! No, not you, Bernard. Felix, let me see that paper.'Wait'? What do you mean, 'wait'?! What the hell are you talking about? Now you listen to me, Bernard. We can't wait! We've got to move now! You're raising phantom issues here. It doesn't matter what happens to gold and francs on a day-to-day basis! We've got to pull ourselves together and just fucking do it!! Look, Bernard. I'm sorry. No. Wait a minute. Wait, Bernard. Bernard! Don't leave me! Don't leave me!Have you seen this? Have you seen this perversion of the truth?Have you read it?Sporatically, Maria. Sporatically.Absolutely wrong! All of it. And who is this Peter Fallow? He has everything wrong. They don't even mention the other boy. And what about the ramp and the tire?! They're talking about a little saint here who was on his way to get milk and cookies for his widowed mother. As they go into the building...What's going on?You don't think it's weird this fellow showed up today. After that unconscionable piece in the paper.You don't think they could possibly trace the car to me?Right. There is the other boy, however. Suppose he came forward.What a wretched painting.I hope not. God, Maria, it looks like you.Where are you going?I'm upset, Maria. I just lost 600 million dollars. And possibly my job. I don't feel terrifically sexy at the moment.Maria, you are incorrigible.I suppose we could still go to the police. We could get a very talented lawyer...Hello, Tony.Right. What's...Oh, yes, yeah. On television. Last night. We said -- my wife said, 'Good Lord, we have a Mercedes and the license starts with an R.'Oh, really?Ah. Well. Yes. Sure. Would you...? Do you...?No. No. Not at all. Come up. Yes. 174D INT. ELEVATOR - SHERMAN, MARTIN AND GOLDBERG - DUSK 174D *Sure. Yes. Go ahead.When exactly was it?I don't know. Let me think. I'd have to figure...My wife. Sometimes. And the people at the garage.Yes.Well... yes.The car?Now?So you want to take a look at the car then.I see.I understand. But if it is a routine, well, I should, I guess I ought to... well, follow the routine that's appropriate to me, to someone with a car in this situation. You see? Martin and Goldberg look at each other. Then they follow Sherman into... 174G INT. LIBRARY - SHERMAN, MARTIN, GOLDBERG - DUSK 174G *Well, I mean, if you have a routine in an investigation like this -- I don't know how these things work, but there must also be a routine for a person like me, an owner of a car with a license number -- I think that's what I need to consider. The routine.That's what I mean. You see?No. I just think... I think that, just to be sure, certain, safe... I think...Well, look. I guess what I should do is, I should... I should talk this over with an attorney. INT. CRIMINAL JUSTICE BUILDING - HALLWAY - KRAMER -But suppose the other fellow comes * forward. I swear there was another one. He was big... *Look, you were recommended as the best criminal lawyer around. I'm not disagreeing with you. But I didn't come here to... I mean, I want to pre-empt this whole situation. I don't want it to go any further.It means I want to take the initiative. I want to go to the police with Maria -- Mrs. Ruskin -- and just tell them exactly what happened. I mean, I don't know about the law, but I feel morally certain that we did what was right -- in the situation we were in. And I don't see...But why?I understand you went to Yale.What did you think of it?What? What is it?I know it was six hundred million, Rawlie. Just stop saying it. I'll straighten it out with Gene first thing in the morning. Well, not first thing. I have a previous appointment.What? What car? No, Rawlie, I can't change it.Rawlie, I'll call you later. Just stay calm. But why do we need a car? They only live six blocks from here.We could walk.Then let's take a taxi.Because a car is going to take us six blocks and wait there for five and a half hours and then drive us another six blocks home and it is going to cost us three hundred and forty-six dollars?! We are hemorrhaging money, Judy. It is pouring out of us with every beat of our heart. Isn't that worth talking about?!? Judy sits down and thinks.Judy, please...We have to talk now.We haven't talked about anything for the last three weeks.Yes, there is. Something is happening here. You have to know about this. Tomorrow morning...I'm going to be arrested in the morning.Uh. Yes.Well, it's unlikely.Ah. Hello.Oh.Excuse me.Uh... Judy...Well, hi.Bonds.Bonds.I want you to meet Aubrey Buffing.The poet. He's on the short list for the Nobel Prize. He has AIDS. You'll love him.Uh, no.You mean he defected. *Are you sure?Maria, I need to talk to you. Something very... unexpected is happening.I'm going to be arrested in the morning.By the police, I imagine.I don't think it will be too bad. My lawyer -- if you can call him that -- has received assurances that it will all be handled in an orderly fashion.Yes. Well. You have a point.The other guy has come forward. He says I was driving the car. I'm going to be arrested tomorrow morning. I need to know from you ... I mean, what do you want me to say?Uh...Top notch. Look. You said this was just a formality.I told Maria. I saw her last night. In case we need her.I don't know. Why?But...I'm going to jail. Aren't I?I'm going to jail. EXT. CAR - MARTIN AND KILLIAN help Sherman out of the car and all hell breaks loose.Hmn? What?I am sorry.I am very sorry. Please forgive me.For my life. For everything. I am truly sorry.I repent all the sins of my past life. I repent...Excuse me, do you know where I can find a taxi?Sherman McCoy.I need a taxi.Oh, fine. Yes, thanks.No, you were very helpful.That's alright. Thanks. I should go.Well...Does this train go anywhere near Park Avenue?My father took the subway every * day of his life. *No. They both laugh.I look terrible.I think, when I was in the jail, I pissed in my pants.I'm alright.I can't think.... and then this newspaper thing started, this Peter Fallow person, and all the facts were wrong, total disregard for the truth. Why do they do this?They call me by my first name. Like they know me. Like they own me. Newspapers, lawyers, police, people I don't even know. How did I get to be so important?I should have called the police right away, when it happened. But I couldn't you see? It wasn't really my decision.I mean, I wasn't driving the car.Uh... no. What? *Excuse me... ANGLE - RAWLIE THORPE approaches Sherman.Rawlie.No. No.Yeah. I haven't really been able to talk to anybody.Oh, well. I should be down there in a day or so...Oh. I see. Well.That's final, huh?Yes. Yes. Of course. Excuse me.Judy. What is going on?But Judy, I mean, under the circumstances...I'm sorry. I am. Believe me.But can you forgive me?I beg your pardon...Well, that's very kind of you.Not at all... uh...Anyway, thank you.The apartment?Excuse me. I have to... uh... Excuse me. INT. LIVING ROOM - SHERMANPollard. How are you?Not at all. The more the merrier.You know, at first I wanted to die. Standing there in court, people calling my name...And then I thought, I have a gun. Twelve gauge. Double barrel... FOLLOW them INTO...Here it is.I wonder if I can get both barrels into my mouth. That's what I was thinking. And how do you pull the trigger. I read somewhere about a man who took off his shoe and pulled the trigger with his toe.And where would I do it? Who would find me?You want me to leave?This is my home...This is the only safe place I have. People are threatening my life. I have to protect myself. He loads the gun and fills his pockets with shells.Alter the facts?! The facts are that I have no place else to go! And you want me to move out?! Is that what you're saying, Pollard. You want me to move out of my home?! The guests begin to listen to this exchange.Why don't you move out, Pollard? If you're so fucking terrified!And you can start by moving out of this apartment right now. Out! Now!Oh, Pollard, you were a ridiculous fat blowhard at Buckley and you're a ridiculous fat blowhard now. Everyone watches as Sherman holds Pollard at gunpoint and steers him out of the room.Another word out of you, Pollard, and there's going to be an unacceptable situation right up * your ass! Now march! * The guests applaud. Sherman turns to face them.And that goes for the rest of you, too. Out. All of you.Out! Stinking lot of anorexic parasites. Get out of my house!Out of my house, out of my life!Sherman McCoy is dead. Sherman McCoy of Park Avenue and Wall Street and Southampton -- gone. Dead. I will never be Sherman McCoy again. Never!Where are you going?That's us! That's me! That's Maria! How did you get this?I suppose we could still go to the police. We could get a very talented lawyer...You mean the apartment was wired * -- bugged -- all that time? *Then we have this as evidence.What do you mean, 'my tape'?Then what good is it?An idea about what?What funeral?I'm sorry, Maria. I have to talk to you.Believe me, I had nothing to do with that. We didn't want your name in the papers any more than you did.You have to help me, Maria.Well, I know this may sound like a strange request, but you could start by telling the police what really happened.But you were driving the car that night.Maria, please...

Now you didn't bake that cake, but every time you hand somebody a slice of that cake, a little bit comes off, little crumbs fall off. And you're allowed to keep those crumbs.Yes. And that's what Daddy does. He passes somebody else's cake around and picks up the crumbs. But you have to imagine a lot of crumbs. And a great golden cake. And a lot of golden crumbs.

He turns, tire in his hands and sees... HIS POV - TWO FIGURES walking toward him. One big, young, powerfully built . He looks dangerous. The other slight, hesitant, a few steps behind the first one . They are both black.Sherman, get in this car.The police?Did you see him get hit?Neither did I. So if the question ever comes up, all that happened was, two boys blocked the road and tried to rob us and we got away. That's all we know. They go into... INT. BROWNSTONE - SHERMAN AND MARIA - NIGHT climbing the stairs.Yes, let's call them and invite them over here to our little love nest. They would love to get their hands on us.

Mr. Sherman McCoy of Park Avenue and Mrs. Arthur Ruskin of Fifth Avenue, recuperating after their adventures in the Bronx -- explain that to your wife.You don't have to feel better, Sherman. I was the one who was driving. And I'm saying I didn't hit anybody, and I'm not reporting anything to the police! And if you are a gentleman, you will support me in that decision. Silence. They are both out of breath. They look at each other. Then Maria starts to unbutton her blouse.We were in the jungle... we were attacked... we fought our way out.We fought. I feel like an animal.The hard part was getting into the seat, getting over that gear shift.That tire...You were bigger, Sherman. You were great...This could be the best sex we've had in a long time.Don't think, Sherman. Don't think. Just fuck.Sherman, darling. I was just thinking about you. Where have you been?Don't I get a kiss first?Oh, Sherman, you know I only read the newspapers spasmodically.Yes. Me, too. Now come on in and have a drink. I know just what you need.Excuse me, but what is going on here?Well, uh... I don't live here. I'm just a guest of Miss Heftshank. So...Christ. That was close.Nothing. Caroline pays $351 for this place. It's rent controlled. I sublet it for eleven hundred a month. But it's not legal. They would love to get Caroline out of here. But they have to prove she doesn't live here.Oh, Sherman. You are completely paranoidical. Look, I have to leave for the airport in twenty minutes. So we don't have much time.How? They don't have the full number, they don't have a witness, and the only one who could recognize you is in terminal comatosis.If he was gonna materialize, he would have done it by now. And the reason he hasn't, is because he's a criminal. Would you get my blue jacket out of that closet? Sherman gets the jacket.

Watch. Boris, darling, would you like me to eat your ass?You see? It went right over his head.Of course, darling, but keep smiling. My husband is watching me. Look at him. He's so pleased with himself. He's just closed a new deal. A charter business. He's going to take Arabs to Mecca on airplanes.Of course, the airplanes are all from Israel...He'll make a fortune.He called me a whore today. Right in front of the servants. I mean, really. How does he expect me to run the house if he humiliates me in front of the help?I'm sorry, Sherman. What are we talking about?Oh, Sherman, what...?!Yes?How very kind. Did you know Arthur?I've reprobated myself over and over again for being away...Well, thank you for the kind words. I must go now.I'm sorry...?Sherman would never tell you that.Look, Mr.... Mr.......

But I'm not sure anybody knows what really happened. Not anymore. And if anybody does know, it certainly isn't me.Was I? I don't remember. Isn't it funny how a little thing like that can slip your mind? God, there's something about funerals that is so stimulating. My panties have been wet all morning.Sherman. What's wrong with you?Then why are you all hunched over? Her hands slide down his back.Sherman, what's this on your back?This lump, this piece of metal, this thing on your back?!You don't have a belt buckle in the back. There's some sort of subterfuge afoot here. Isn't there?You are secreting something on your body!I want to see what it is. She rips open his shirt.And a wire! A wire! She pulls the wire.

In the audience, Bacon, Fox, Gerald Moore, Weiss and finally Peter Fallow taking notes.... and I wanted to report the incident but he wouldn't let me. He said he was driving and it was his decision to make.I was shocked. There are certain qualities of virtue that I admire in a human being, virtues that I hope I possess myself...We have time for a quickie.

Which means, loosely translated, that you have no evidence.Your Honor, the District Attorney, Mr. Weiss... JUDGE WHITE * I know who the district attorney is. I know Mr. Weiss. And the only reason Mr. Weiss is interested in the case is because Mr. Williams over there is a white man who lives in a nice big house in Riverdale.I don't follow, sir...

They would devour you. They would eat you up.Forget it's already a political football. Forget the T.V. and Reverend Bacon and Weiss has an election coming up.

Yeah. Yeah. He puts down the phone and looks at Sherman.We got a problem.They're going to arrest you. *How do you feel?No problem. They promised me.That explains it. She left the country this morning. You know some Italian painter named Filippo Sharutti, something like that?I think your girl friend found a new boyfriend.It's not going to be so bad. This is routine. I talked to Andruitti again last night. He promised me. We'll be in and out of there. No problem. Nobody is ever going to know it happened.What for?Wait a minute. What the fuck?! What press?! I talked to Ray last night. He promised no bullshit.Somebody is going to pay for this.Don't talk. What's going on here?!Let me get out first. Now listen. You don't say anything. Don't cover your face. Don't hang your head. You don't even know they're there. Okay?Don't make any statements! Don't talk to anybody, especially in the pens! I'll be upstairs when they bring you up for arraignment...Yeah? Fuck you, too, Kramer. ANGLE - PETER FALLOW pulls himself up off the ground. He is more dazed than hurt.Just say, not guilty.Your Honor, the defendant is under extreme stress. He pleads not guilty.Just shut up, Sherman. Defendant pleads not guilty!Your Honor, Mr. Kramer knows very well...This is patent nonsense. Bail has already been agreed to. The Spectators are booing and yelling at Killian to shut up.Yeah. I checked it all out. * Whoever sent me this tape is * either a big fan of yours or a not * so big fan of Maria Ruskin. *No. It's an illegal tape. Totally illegal. The guy who did this could go to jail for this. Now if this were your tape, it would be legal. But it's not.Well, if you were wired and you recorded your own conversation that would be okay.
