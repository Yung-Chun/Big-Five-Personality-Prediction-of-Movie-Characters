Ninety-nine percent of them think the answer is A). The truth alone triumphs. What do we think, Jamal? A hundred percent would have made me a little more reassured, maybe....Are you married, Jamal?Well, don't despair, there's someone out there who thinks our national motto is \"Fashion alone triumphs\". You two could be very well matched....won four thousand rupees!One more question before the commercial break. What will our Call Centre Assistant do next?Religion! Interesting.

Please follow me.This is....the Taj Mahal.The Taj Mahal was built by the Emperor Khurram for his wife Mumtaz who was maximum beautiful woman in the whole world. When she died, the Emperor decided to build this five star hotel for everyone who wanted to visit her tomb...but he died in- in fifteen eighty-seven, before any of the rooms were built. Or the lifts.

Which way?Oh. Well. She did come back, then she went away when Alfie split up with her and now she's back again.But it looks as if Alfie still fancies Mo after all, so-Rajneesh...- `friends and family'. I know.Two minutes.You have to dial when Prem says \"if\". \"If you want the chance to be a contestant on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire...\" That's when they open the lines.That's what Anjum in Technical says.

Prakash wants a shit.Since there was a customer waiting, that's when.You just lost me good money, you stupid idiot-Krishna, quick!- I saw him. He was with them.- he was with them!- shut up, Jamal, can't you? Just shut up!Ja!Go away. Ja, ja!She'll have the Security Guard onto us, standing there.No.I am the head of this family, now. And I say no. Piss off, you.We don't even know what the third musketeer's called.Useless bloody look-out. What good is she, huh?A saint.Okay, let's go, let's go! It's not a bloody holiday!Give me that.What, chot\u00e9 bhai? You got a problem?Here. For you.You'll earn double.

You got some disease? You force me back to this shit-hole, we leave our friends, a good life, loads of money- for this. Isn't that enough?No, you did, Jamal, not me. Me, I don't give a shit about her. Plenty of pussy in Bombay for Salim. Oh, yes, sir! You should come down the Cages on Saturday night instead of searching for your lost love.\"I'm going to Chowpatti\". There are nineteen million people in this city, Jamal. Forget her. She's history.I'm looking for Cherry.I'm Latika's brother.Is it her or not?Shit, she's sexy, man....No.Leave him. Get over there.Money.Maman never forgets.

Or Gunmaster G-9 will shoot you right between the eyes. Boom. Don't think he won't. You have five seconds. One, two, three, four-Jamal!God is good, bhai. God is good.Maman's boys were after us. Had to skip.Left a message at reception. Waited weeks for you in Nagpur.Bhai, I left a message.I know.Can you believe it? This was our slum. We lived just there, huh? Now it is business, apartments, call centres...Fuck USA, fuck China. India is at the centre of the world, now, bhai. And I am at the centre of the centre, Jamal. This is all Javed-bhai's.Who else would protect us from Maman's gang, huh?Anything he asks.He is coming. You must go. My card.You think I am going to let you out of my sight again, little brother? You stay with me now. Ab phut!Still? She's gone, Jamal. Long gone. Now go. Quick.Look at it, bhai, look at it!A\u00e9 khuda mujh\u00e9 baksh d\u00e9 main\u00e9 bahut gunaah kiy\u00e9 hain....Why can't you let it alone? You want money, I'll give you money. Girls? I can get you girls.You're like some crazy man- you're obsessed.Know what your destiny is, crazy boy? A bullet between the eyes. And after that, he'll kill her. Is that what you want? Huh?Yes. About that, you are right.I didn't sell her. Javed wanted her. He gets what he wants.She's doing alright. Get it into your thick head, Jamal. She's not yours and she never will be.Where you'll never find her. Or me. You could have joined us, you bloody idiot, been one of us. You've lost everything now. Everything.We're out. I'll just get- Syed.Final answer?That boy. He will never give up. Never.Crazy chutiy\u00e9.Ja. Go.- just drive. There won't be another chance. Go.It is not written.You have to.
