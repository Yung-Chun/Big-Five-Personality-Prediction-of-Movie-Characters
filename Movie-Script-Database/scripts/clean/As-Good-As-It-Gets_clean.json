{"As-Good-As-It-Gets": {"MELVIN": {"raw_line": "Come here, sweetheart... come on.Wanna go for a ride? Okay, sweetie?You've pissed your last floor, you dog-eared monkey.I'll bet you wish you were some sort of real dog now, huh? Don't worry... this is New York. If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere, you know? You ugly, smelly fuck.What's he look like?I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...How're you doing?What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?Hope you find him. I love that dog.I love throwing your dog down the garbage chute.'Somewhat in the dark, she had confessed and he had forgiven. This is what you live for, he said. Two heads on a pillow where there is only the safety of being with each other. How, she wondered, could she find such hope in the most shameful part of her.''At last she was able to define love. Love was... ''Love was... '... Son-of-a-bitch-pansy-assed- stool-pusher.Yeeeess!!!Well, that's a load off.Do you realize that I work at him?Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone... don't knock ... not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?Okay, then.Oh, I'm pissed!! Now I am really pissed!!!No touch. No touch. No touch.Police! Police! Fucking crooked police... doughnut-munching morons help me! Assault and battery and you're black.People who talk in metaphors can shampoo my crotch. Eat up.I'm starving.I've got Jews at my table.How much more you got to eat? Your appetite isn't as big as your noses, is it?The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will.Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend... now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, \"Thank you.\" No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.I see the help -- judgement call.What's wrong with your son, anyway?No.His name?Okay.How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.Just move on. No one here killed him.Ask him.I'm not saying nothing to you.Hey, where are you going? You can't do this. I can't take a dog. Nobody's ever been in here before.You're dead!!I don't have dog food. And I won't want dog food here. You'll eat what we have. You'll eat what we eat.Don't you touch anything.Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.It's okay -- I'll sit here.How old are you?If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.Otherwise, you're not ugly.What's with the dark?No... no... leave it... the bacon's for the dog.Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...It's a beautiful day for our walk.Don't be like me, don't you be like me. You stay just the way you are because you are a perfect man. I'm gonna take you home and get you something to eat... what you love.Let's go home and do some writing.\"He turned off the gas jets and carried her outside. He kissed her brow and when her eyes opened and found him, he said, 'there are easier ways to break a date.' She laughed. The only sensible ambition he had ever known was now realized. He had made the girl happy. And what a girl. 'You've saved my life,' she said, 'you'd better make it up to me.'\"Done! Yes, I hate the doggy... yes, I hate the doggy.Sixty-two books... done!He's a pain in the ass.It's been five weeks... another few won't kill me.Okay by me.That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.Over the dog... an ugly dog.Worst sidewalk in New York and look where they put in.Help!Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as \"obsessive compulsive disorder\" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?You changed the room around...Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time... I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?What if this is as good as it gets?No. No. Get Carol.What are you trying to do to me?Hey, elephant girl, call her or something... just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait. Do it!!!I'll be quiet. Just let me wait. No problem. Get her here -- have her get me two sausages, four bacon, two eggs over easy and coffee. I'm not a prick here -- I'm a great customer. This day is a disaster. I can't handle this, too.There's going to be trouble???Carol's last name?I'm hungry. You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.What about your mother?I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!How ya doing?You should answer when someone talks to you...Shut up, kids!I'll ride up front. Cover your mouth when you cough, kid.Yeah, yeah... any chance you'll get back to work today?I need this. Just say, \"Melvin, I'll try,\" okay?Great, wonderful. I don't need you to wait with me.What's it mean?Oh God, this is like a nightmare.I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.Is he dead yet?Absolutely.Sure thing.Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City \"Sailor want to hump-hump bar\"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here.Maybe I'll bring him some food by.It smells like shit in here?That cleaning woman doesn't...Where are all your queer party friends?Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.Don't piss on a gift, tough guy. You want to know why the dog prefers me... it's not affection. It's a trick.I carry bacon in my pocket.Now we'll both call him.Yo, yo, yo...Stupid dog. I don't get it.Carol the waitress?I was working... can't you just drop me a thank-you note?Note. Put it in the note.To get you back at work so you can wait on me.You waiting for me to say something? What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.What needs clearing up?I'm sorry. We don't open for the no-sex oaths until 9 a.m.Okay!!!! Anything else?!?So you'll be at work?I took a chance you were up.I brought you Chinese soup.I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back... But the tiredness -- boy... Not just sleepy.Yeah...I'm glad we did this.Good talking to you.It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.What's this?Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'\"What?\" Look at you... You sense a mark.About a dog.Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.Think white and get serious.Like the wind but I'm not doing it.He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.Okay. I'll take him. Get him packed -- ready -- tomorrow morning.Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.Last word freak.Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.Hey, what I did for you is working out?No... no thank you notes.Lovely.Nice of you... thank you.Now I want you to do something for me.I want you to go on this trip.I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.Two days.You take off when you have to.Bettes tells me he's doing fine.What's that got to do with it?Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.Is there another way to see it?Woo-woo.Are you still coming?Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next. That you might ask -- I'm not certain.Oh. We might. Yes. We can. Let's.Whether crabs are in season there now...No. Everybody gets their own cage?Put him in with that one, not that one... ... Builds his confidence.Soak it up -- it's your last chance at a hug for a few days.Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.I was going to do that for you.I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.Never a break. Never.You're really jammed back there.Welcome.I got the whole ride programmed.Just wanted to see what you'd do. No, we have greatness here.Doesn't matter. She's enjoying herself. Consider it part of the music.Nonsense!This stuff is pointless.You like sad stories -- you want mine.... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.Two bedrooms and the sofa opens...Yes... sure. I'll take the sofa.Can I ask you a personal question?Do you ever get an erection for a woman?Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...I give you that one... Nice packing.Dancing?I'm going to jump in the shower. I'll be right with you.They sell hard shell crabs here?Hi. You have hard shells, right?Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.What?No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.Wait here.I need a coat and tie.No.That jacket and give me a tie.You have hard shells?Everyone else says you do.No, it's all right. I'll just watch.I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.No... ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.Okay.Can we order first?Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer. Baked or fries?One baked -- one fries.Okay, I got a real great compliment for you and it's true.Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake. I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. \"Hate,\" I am using the word \"hate\" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.You make me want to be a better man.Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.Takes months to know... They work little by little. Talking like this is exhausting.Never.You don't owe me that.Well, ah... that's a personal question.There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...It's one idea...I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.It was a mistake.So then, the next thing I know, she's sitting right next to me, and then, well, it's not right to go into the details, but I screwed up. I got nervous. I said the wrong thing and if I hadn't, I could be in bed now with a woman who if you could make her smile you got a life. Instead, I'm here with you, no offense, a moron pushing the last legal drug.Did you have sex with her?Sorry, didn't realize she was right there. Did you have sex with her?I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...What are you talking about? You got real problems.Aww Jesus! No choice.Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.Do it then. Get the dog picked up. I can't believe you let it stay there.Good-bye. Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.Does it matter?What do you mean? You said you liked it.This one has a special meaning.Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.I'll take you... why not?Don't say anything.I told you to go on in.I think you gotta camp it here...They took your place furnished. Jackie said she grabbed your personal stuff -- they were supposed to set you up here. There's this extra room -- I never use. It gets good light. No other answer really.They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?I'll tell you, buddy, I'd be the luckiest guy alive if that did it for me.Look, we both want the dog -- and...Here. Take the dog.Hello.How you doing?That seems like a good choice.The two might go together.Cute.Okay to say something now?I should've danced with you.So long.You going to come talk to me or not?I'm a great guy -- \"extraordinary\"... ... and she doesn't want contact with me. I'm dying here.No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out. Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.Absolutely not.Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.I forgot to lock the door.Were you asleep?'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.Were you asleep?I'm sorry I woke you -- some other time.What a break...I had to see you...It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.Wait a minute, I'm overstating here, maybe the inside stairs. I don't want to sit with my feet in the gutter. What does that serve? It only...Boyfriend?Maybe we could live without the wise cracks.It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.Just let me talk. I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence... ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...I think most people miss that about you and I watch wondering how they can watch you bring them food and clear their dishes and never get that they have just met the greatest woman alive... And the fact that I get it makes me feel great... about me! You got a real good reason to walk out on that?I'm gonna grab you. I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.I know I can do better.", "clean_line": "come sweetheart come wanna ride okay sweetie ve pissed floor dog eared monkey ll bet wish sort real dog huh worry new york know ugly smelly

Here, good doggie...Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there! Have you seen Verdell?My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?Which color was that?Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I think you know that.Do you still think I was exaggerating?You don't love anything, Mr. Udall.Thank the good Lord... wow... my honey... where have you been?Just for a second, okay?Look at him... where was little baby?Go ahead, John, you earned your fun. How did he get down in the basement? I mean even if he got on the elevator how... ?My God! No!Mr. Udall.Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.Maybe this can wait.I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.Did you... do something to him?No, I didn't.No... actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.So the theory of confrontations is that now he'll think twice before messing with me?He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?Sorry, I was out in the studio doing some work and I forgot about our appointment.I usually make such a big deal out of picking models but Carl's so thorough. I'll bet he drove you nuts checking your references.This isn't a nude.Exactly what is your previous experience?Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, \"hold that pose.\" Then just try and comfortably hold it.No... Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching... an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.Hold it.You can put on anything you want now. I might be sort of done here...Yes... well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.Just a second -- he has to go.What's the matter, sweetheart?Why are you doing this?I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.That bad, huh?Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?How could you do that? He'll hurt him.You are very certain my dog is okay... because you have no idea...Okay, waiting gives the devil time. Now!Oh my... Where'd I go? Ummmm?Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?Thank you. Verdell... sweetheart? By the way, thanks for saving me.Verdell?Hi, sweetheart.No. Please, don't force him.Sorry. What are those cards?Terrify me?Well, I can't reach them.Here, baby... what is it, Verdell?... You miss the tough guy... Well, here I am, you little pissant mop, happy to see me? How about another ride down the chute? Oh, God... I don't mean it, sweetheart... I'm sorry. I know...I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?... Just tell me.Wow...Let's use just one poor, okay? Anyway, dear, thanks for everything. Forgive my recent crankiness and as soon as things are on track again I'll call.What's wrong?No, no.Hello?... yes... sure... finally, huh? Why, \"finally\"? Because I called you so many times. Maybe Oh, boy... I was hoping it was something like that. You didn't get one of them, huh? 'Cause I mean it wasn't only your office -- it was your home, hotel and the cigar club you like in San Francisco. No -- Sarcastic... Of course. I believe you. No, don't fire anyone... Please. Maybe I'm wrong about the 20 times. Take a breath... So, you miss me a little? Hey, strike the question -- How's the case going? Really. Fantastic. I didn't hear. I haven't been watching. Great. Just great. I'm so happy. Whoopie! Me? Well, I'm mending. No, I look fine. Well, some of the damage might still be noticeable if you look closely...Carl, I need some help and you're the logical one to turn to. No! Not 'cause I blame you for what happened. I hardly get how you can ever think that. No, I'm not being sarcastic. I guess because you hired the guy who did this you think... No, I am a sarcastic person. Well, if you must know, the reason I said you were the logical person is because you always told me how you thought I was this great person who made you feel good about humanity and everything. You do remembering saying that? Well, whew. Okay, so Carl. I hate asking but this money thing is ridiculously serious...\"Will you please loan me money? I will pay you back. I will give you whatever percentage of my income I don't absolutely need until I do. It will take a while. But I don't know what I'll do if you say\"... that. I understand... yes... No, I do. But you know, you know -- you didn't even ask how much, Carl? Well, Frank has no right to discuss how much I'm in hock... no, you're right -- not the point. So... what have you been up to??? Uh-huh... Oh, the group show... how was it? Well, I'm not surprised that there's that much talent around... great... Look -- gotta go... no, you shouldn't feel that way at all... take care, you, too... you, too... Good-bye. Pal o' mine.Thank you for walking him.If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.Go away.Please, just leave.Get out.Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?Rot in hell, Melvin.Is this fun for you? Well, you lucky devil... It just gets better and better. I am losing my apartment and Frank wants me to promise to paint hotter subjects and to beg my parents, who haven't called, for help... and I won't. And I don't want to paint anymore.So the life I was trying for is over. The life I had is gone and I am feeling so damn sorry for myself that it is difficult to breathe. Right times for you -- huh, Melvin. The gay neighbor is terrified... Terrified... Lucky you, you're here for rock bottom... me wallowing in self-pity in front of you, you absolute horror of a human being...Get out.Oh, my gosh.Come on, sweetheart...Would you leave now, please?Thanks.Got any easier questions?But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.So am I, Frank.I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.That's very thoughtful.I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.Do you want to know what happened with my parents?Well...Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.Okay. Well, one day my father came in on one of those painting sessions when I was nine -- and he just started screaming at her -- at us -- at evil. And...I was trying to defend my mother and make peace, in the lamest way. I said, \"she's not naked -- it's art.\" And then he started hitting me. And he beat me unconscious. After that he talked to me less and less -- he knew before I left for college, my dad came into my room. He held out his hand. It was filled with money. A big wad of sweaty money. And he said to me, \"I don't want you to ever come back.\" I grabbed him and I hugged him... He turns and walked out.Not it at all, really.Melvin...You consider your life easy.I can't, I'm exhausted.No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.Ah, this is Simon... I'm here in town... ... and, folks, you haven't come home later than 10 in your lives. Please pick up -- really... Okay... I'm going to call again in the morning. I need to see you. Or, at least get you to answer the phone.Hello... Hello???Was this supposed to be your room?Can you not be violent?No!!!Uh-huh...Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.How to die, mostly.Good night.Hold it.I've got to sketch you.I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.But you're beautiful... your skin glows.That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...No. No. This is great, this is so great. I can't get the angle with this cast.I just love her. How're you doing?Hello, hi, Mom -- I can barely hear you. Do you have to whisper? No -- don't apologize -- it was the luckiest thing for all of us that you didn't answer last night... I can't hear you... okay, dear, just listen to me then.... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye.I'm going back with you.I'll take care of myself --I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.You think you're kidding.Another place where?I love you... Let him take you home.Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...What are you talking about?I know the feeling -- you feel like your ol' self again, huh? -- Mommy and Daddy are home.Sorry... You're fun to mess with.Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.I love you.Where is my big hairy boy?Verdell, sweeties?Sorry, didn't know you were awake. I just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then...Should I get it?Hello.Hello. It's me. He took me in. Did you know? Hold on, I'll get him for you.It's Carol.Good luck.I'm coming.What did she say?Because... ... you love her?Okay... you tell me why -- \"You're dying here.\"Did you like it that much?Picking on me won't help.But you know where you're lucky?You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.What's wrong?", "clean_line": "verdell good doggie mr udall excuse hey seen verdell dog know mean little dog adorable face know dog looks like color frank sachs melvin udall franks

I'm walking out the door this morning and he says to me, 'Mom, I promise not to get one of my fevers or coughs during your date.'Little blonde angle. Eat everything.I owe you. I told you today... them's the rules. Oh, excuse me, Melvin.Will you please take it?\"Ready\" is not my problem.Go sit down. You know you're not allowed back here... Spencer's more excited about it than I am... He says, \"Mom, I promise not to get a fever or couch during your date.\"I know. He's just the best.It's not your table. It's the place's table. Behave. This once, you can sit at someone else's station.Or you can just wait your turn...Bryan says he doesn't care how long you've been coming you ever act like this again you're barred for life. I'm gonna miss the excitement, but I'll handle it.You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?If you ever mention my son again, you will never be able to eat here again. Do you understand? Give me some sign you understand or leave now. Do you understand me... you crazy freak? Do you?!?Okay. I'll get your order.I... I... I don't know... You got me.Let me just do whatever I do by myself... I'll catch up to you someplace I promise. Oh, no... don't look like that. No. I'm sorry if I'm a goof.Kissing... kissing boys. Oh my.Like what did you think I was going to do?Don't be silly. How bad?You can't smoke... He can't take smoke.Oh, God... I don't even notice anymore.That'll teach you.That wasn't an apology.Hey... this is just a little throw- up -- it's nothing to be so embarrassed about. Really. Thanks for the dinner. Let me write down which trains you take to get back.Okay.What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours... afraid it isn't clean?Just give yourself a little pep talk. \"Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out.\"What do you care?He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection... Is this bothering you?An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.Spencer.Spence.So what are you doing with a dog?You're not worried that someone might take him?Sorry.You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.Oh, please...And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age... how old are you?Okay, pal... I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.Dawn patrol -- major dawn patrol. My son had a full blown attack. And this time, for extra fun, they gave us the wrong antibiotics, so I get him home...You all set here?What are you doing here?Are you totally gone? This is my private home...What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?My son is sick, okay?How do you know about my mother?Sorry, honey... I'll be right there.Sorry. There is a limit, Melvin, and I can't handle you teaching my son manners.We are going to treat ourselves to a cab ride.Melvin, wait!Melvin... give us a lift. We've got to go see our friends at the hospital.Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital, please and quickly please.I owe you three dollars.No!!! Stay away from me!Hello? Hello?What? Please? Now? Tell me?!Not your name... what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better... and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and... you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold.No, I didn't. So why are you h...Huh?Stay out of this... Doctor?I'm a waitress.You're going to get the results today?!Since forever.Yes.Emergency room only.No.No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit... I'm sorry... forgive me.Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?His home number.Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?No.Doc!!! So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.It lets a crazy man into our lives.Uh, Udall?Yes.The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.That's not why I'm here... ... though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...Why did yo do this for me?But you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I'm worried that you did this because...I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.I'm not kidding.Just how grateful I am.Yes.I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts. This can't be right -- con- science.I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married. Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any. Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?Leave me be! Why are you doing this? Why are you picking at my sores... What is it that you want?... You want what? What's with you? I hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all I want is to not do this has some purpose. What is it, Mom? No kidding.What is it you want? What?Okay.We're going out.Okay -- we're out of here. I love you.Do you love me?Don't get it wet.So it's okay?I wanted him to know how much he'd done. Can you believe he's eating with someone.Melvin.A thank-you note for what you did for me.Getting loud, getting loud.I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city.So. Anything else?Okay.What you did changed my life.Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that. I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...... and I'm sorry for never spotting, right there at the table in the restaurant, the human being that had it in him to do this thing for us... You know what, I'm just going to start from the beginning... I have not been able to express my gratefulness to you... even as I look at the word \"grateful\" now it doesn't begin to tell you what I feel for you...Thank you.Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, \"what?\" I thought I said, \"what?\"... What?No, sir...The stiff one eye?I can't. I work.My son.Melvin, I'd rather not.Funny, I thought it was a strong point.Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?No.Well, here's a little suitcase shocked that it's been used.There's not way to pack for this trip... well, I'll tell you -- I'm not packing the camera.Hello?Yes.Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.You stand there and I'll wave to you from the back window.I love you.Sensitive, huh?!Hi.Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.Thanks, Melvin.Hey, I like this music.I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.Yes. I really would.No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.Now go ahead.Hey -- you let him...Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.Well, you know -- I still stay what I said. You've got to get past it all when it comes to your parents. We all have these horror stories to get over.No.No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?Hello... Hi, Spencer... Why are you out of breath? You did?!? That is great... So great... So -- no, wait a second, Spence...My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?What a nice compliment.I'm happy. And you're my date. Let's get dressed.Stop asking everyone.You promised a nice place -- can't you just... You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?My drink is following me.You look s...You look great.You wanna dance?And?Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.And mean it...Fries.I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...I don't quite get how that's a compliment for me.That's maybe the best compliment of my life.So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?Here's the trouble with never.That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.If you ask me... I'll say, \"yes.\"Sex with Simon?That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!I'll never forget you said it.Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.I don't think so. You need help with the pants?I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.I'm sorry... are you okay?Why? What have you been thinking about?Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.Good night.No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...Stop staring. Do a vase.Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...All right, cut me a break.I don't care how you put it -- We're being naughty here, pal.To hell with sex.We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.But what about...One night with me!I got a gift for you.Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!I don't want to hear that music right now.I don't.It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.I'll take a bus.I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself. You have my number.Don't want to. I love you.Yeah... Well...I can trust my brain.I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?It's really something that you're looking after Simon. And what I said on the street. That was a bad thing to say. And it made me sick to my stomach. It was a bad thing to say. And I'd be lying if I didn't say that I enjoyed your company... but the truth is you do bother me enormously and I know -- think -- that it's best for me to not have contact with you because you're just not ready and you're a pretty old guy to not be ready... and I'm too old to ignore that. But there were extraordinary kindnesses that did take place. So thanks for the trips...Go ahead.Okay. Good-bye.What do you want, Melvin?What do you want?Grouchy?What job?What are you doing here?I wasn't asleep!!Is it a secret what you're doing here?Because...Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.Maybe we could...See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.Okay.I'm sorry, Melvin -- but whatever this is -- is not going to work.Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well... I'm not the answer for you.You know what? I...No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so.
