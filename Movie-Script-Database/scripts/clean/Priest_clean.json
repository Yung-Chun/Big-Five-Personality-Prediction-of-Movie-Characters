{"Priest": {"HICKS": {"raw_line": "Since the beginning -- the two have been locked forever in combat... The vampires were quicker, stronger and had the gift of flight. Quick glimpses of a bloody, brutal battle. Men screaming. Talons ripping. FIERY ARROWS launched against an unseen enemy.But man had the sun. THE CAMERA TILTS DOWN to find another GROUP OF MEN -- more sophisticated than the first. Makeshift weapons made of metal and steel slung across their backs glinting in the sunlight. They stand before AN EARTHEN STRUCTURE, looks like a GIANT WASP NEST. Unsheathing their weapons, they step grimly inside. We HEAR a HISSING WAIL and the wielding of steel.Then came THE PRIESTS -- The Man turns and we see his face is shadowed by a large CROSS TATTOO, cutting across his eyes and down the center.-- Specially trained warriors in the art of vampire combat. They single-handedly turned the tide for the humans. Quick glimpses of a GROUP OF PRIESTS battling a FURY OF VAMPIRES . Their technique is otherworldy -- combining the brutality of a Maori Warrior. with the grace of a Samurai. The--combat-is intense. Glorious. An explosion of blood and s b m i lOver time the vampire threat faded. The once fierce race now fatally diminished. A shadow of what they once. were. Through heavy smoke, we see a pile of VAMPIRE CORPSES, a ragged collection of fangs and claws.The remaining vampires were put Into camps and -- by decree of the High Clergy the Priests disbanded. The former warriors to be integrated as members of regular society. We see a WAX SEAL pressed onto an ancient parchment. The document carefully rolled and stored in an ORNATE CHAMBER.The human race thrived in relative quiet. The vampire menace quickly forgotten for other, more modern threats.Thought you'd come back for a souvenir, hub? You gotta be the dumbest bloodsucker I ever come across. Priest steps into a pool of moonlight, illuminating his face.I'll be dammed. He casually spits some ATOMIC CHAW, hitting the floorboards with a SIZZLE.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2Scuse me a minute, He heads towards the crowd, the salesman continuing his pitch.You best get in that van and clear on out, mister.I got six right here.That's one. KAPOW! The windshield cracks like a spiderweb.Two. Immediately, the salesman quickly packs up his wares, scrambling for the van door. As he gets in, he catches a look at Priest, pauses a moment, then starts up the vehicle and quickly PEELS away. Hicks pulls the knife from the wall, holds the bag up to the crowd.Now you all listen up. This bag ain't good fornothin' but linin' that man's pockets with your hard earned money. Much shuffling amongst the people -- they trust in their sheriff but they're frightened. An older man named, CROCKER, steps up.I seen enough two-bit hustlers and carry barkers. He ain't no better.Take a look. Ain't nothin' but sand, flour and maybe 'a little garlic.. Oldest trick in theI filed a report with the Cities last night. I'm sure they're Join' all they can. The townspeople mutter amongst themselves. Hicks looks over to Priest, a GROUP OF CHILDREN have already gathered,. pointing and whispering at him.I've already had one of the boys send for your brother. We got him put up at Paddy's place. Priest gazes out . the; window. A group of TOWNSPEOPLE are milling out front, staring at him.. He pulls down the shade.You're gonna have to excuse the attention.. We don't get strangers `round here too much -- \"Specially no Priest. 'Course we ain't never had no vampire attack in.these parts before. But then you're just here to perform the service, right? Priest doesn't reply, staring at a yellowed wanted poster.Never much of a believer myself. I figure I got one bullet to shoot. I'm gonna shoot it my way... not how some BOOK tells me to.Stands apart from the others, hat in his hands. His eyes focused on Priest. Not even watching as -- Aaron plants the RUBY RED FLOWER at the head of the grave. Its glorious color almost obscene in this barren wasteland.Aaron.You mind if I have a word-with your brother? An awkward BEAT as the two stare at each other. Both knowing what the other's thinking.I'm sure you're well aware of the Vampire Protection Act.it strictly states it is forbidden for anyone to hunt vampires anymore.These days, things go through proper channels. Paperwork drawn up. investigators called in. Procedures followed. 'Course we both know after a week, girls taken by vampires either and up dead or worse -- turned.On the other hand -- if I go after Lucy there'll be a warrant on mybead too...and that'll put us in the same briar patch.We leave at sun up. Priest turns. A moment as each man studies the other.We're the only chance she's got. Priest picks a bullet from the table, a carefully notched CROSS now in its tip . He SNAPS it in the air.Better than I am with a knife. Priest considers this.What's with all the bullets anyway? I thought Priests don't use firearms.Didn't mean to be late -- My deputies are a little green about keepin' the peace all by their lonesome. Needed a pep talk.The Nightshade Reservation.. Ain't nothin' but red-outs and rejects. They're a fallen tribe.What happens in two hours?This is how most of the reservations are these days. We see faces peering out from wooden slats. Gaunt,: lifeless eyes. These'are FAMILIARS.Nobody really enforces it. most come from the fringes. Drifters. They're creepy as all hell -- but harmless. They turn off their bikes and dismout. Hicks stepping awkwardly between the chickens. A MALE FAMILIAR stands with a butcher knife over a basin. His gaze is slack -- More dead than alive. He picks up a chicken and CHOP1 off goes its head, blood draining into the container. His voice a hissing rasp.We're looking for a Vamp Pack. They woulda' came through here a couple nights ago.Then you won't mind if we have a look around? The Familiar picks up another chicken. Raises the butcher knife.Not supposed: to do that without a warrant -- BAMI -- Priest kicks the door in. We hear the Familiar SCREECH as Priest steps inside --Lets loose with a mean roundhouse. Plugging him in the chest. in one quick motion he rips the butcher blade from his arm, flinging it at the nearestPulls off his COWBOY HAT. Activating a release. With a CLICK! thousands- of needle--like teat ext e d fro the brim. With deadly accuracy, he flings the hat: It FLASHES through the air, DAIS'iWHEELING around a Familiar's neck, pinpricking his skin and finally whirling back to Hicks' band likean obedient pup. A BEAT as the Familiar stands, mouth agape. Then with a wet SNAP his head rolls off his shoulders, THUDDING in the dirt. Hicks falls to the ground, his wound starting to get the best of him. He musters up his strength for another hat attack but before he can --Why?Dazed, watches as the vampire's body erupts with death spasms, arms and legs kicking the air in a violent frenzy until finally all life drains away.Jesus. Another VAMPIRE careens towards him. Coming in low, crawling across the ground on all fours. Fangs dripping. Hicks FIRES off a mess of bullets, peppering the creature as it flails backwards screeching. He snaps out the empty shells, reloading almost supernaturally fast, firing off a shot that SPLITS the Vampire's throat. He twirls the gun, flipping it into his holster. This leaves onlyShould we go after him?Lucky I guess. The blade didn't go that deep. Don't know what got into those Familiars to attack like that. They're usually harmless. Priest finds a KNIPE clutched in a dead Familiar's hand, tucks it in his waistband.You did this on purpose, didn't you? You knew we wouldn't. be out before sundown. You wanted this to happen.The stomach I got. I was in the Rangers two years. Even fought in the Boondock Uprising...I saw some crazy things.it comes easy to you... don't it?Killin'.What?Why? You gonna shoot me now? Priest's stare is piercing. A pause then Hicks pulls his six shooter, handing it to him. Priest checks the chambers, giving it a quick spin.You're teaching me to shoot?My ass I In case you didn't notice I was pretty damn good out there! And I sure as hell didn't see you doin' much when I had that blade buried in my arm.Ain't nothin' but a bunch of bullshit.Jericho. It's clear across the Plains. Gonna be a rough ride.Walkin' Pete talked about this place -- said it. used to be really somethin'. Everythin' growin' green as a goddamn dollar bill. . 'Course we had to go and screw it up by poisonin' everythin' -- nothin' pretty survives this world ...nothin' decent anyways.Sore. Cut's still open. As Hicks hands the canteen back, Priest suddenly grabs his arm it's completely healed. Not even a scar.My grandmother... she was raped. Nobody knows -- It's recessive in my family. No bloodthirst. No light sensitivity. I'm not proud... but it's a part of me. Ain't nothin' I can do. I woulda told you...just didn't want you treatin' me no different. It hangs there. the'silence stretching like a rope,then Priest REVS his cycle; a flurry ofdust kicking up as he speeds away. HOLD ON HICKS -- Eyes stinging, he watches Priest. Finally he starts his bike, following.Gotta be a desert rat. They park their bikes about twenty feet from the rickety structure, Hicks stepping off his bike and approaching. Carefully.Let me do the talkin'. The sun has a way of cookin' these people's brains so they ain't quite right - BANG! A rifle shot kicks up dust at Hicks' feet.Easy now old timer. I'm a sheriff. The old man snorts, spitting a thick stream of tobacco,. it sizzles when it hits the dust.Sounds like a bunch of religious mumbo jumbo to me. The old man stares fixedly at Priest.What is it?That's angel shit?Why we listen' to that crackpot? Crazy fucker's so blinded by faith he's batahit. That's called a zealot in my. book.This is bullshit. Lucy's been gone five days'-- every stupid minute we waste here is a minute more she gets farther-away. Priest turns and sees a STONE STAIRCASE, uneven steps leading. downwards...too dark to tell where though.Great.Shit. He wipes the blood on his pants, not noticing as a A LARGE SHAPE looms in the archway behind him...What the hell is that thing?II'm not stupid. Vampires don't look like that.Who the hell are you?! (7, She doesn't even bother to respond,.just shooting a look as the two warriors boundPoint A...meet point fuckin' B. He smiles, twirling his six shooters back into their holsters.- Hey.you guys better get a look at thisl The warriors lock eyes, knowing something's been started -- but.unsure of what. They head down the stone steps.That ain't no birthmark -- it's a brand. The Priestess studies the mark, something about it making her skin crawl. Maybe because it's in'theshape of a top hat.Guess they're not as endangered as everyone thought.Are Priests allowed to, you know...have relations?Look...I was uh, wondering --. how did he do that little stunt back there?Including you? She nods.So what's the trick?Remember... what?Yeah.. See what?I'll start with the sheriff.'Damn. He shakes his head, heading towards the holding area as --There ain't nobody left. Nobody.Where's Priest?Don't make no sense. What were they doin' out here?Who? The Priests just stare into the fire, not having any idea.I imagine you'll have to go back to the Cities, inform the Clergy. A sudden silence.It's a railroad spike. My pop used to work boxcars before they shut down -- Why the hell would anyone wanna swallow that? A beat as Priest puts it together.The Dunkirk Line. It starts all the way in the backcountry, bought the ore from the deep mines. There were about five stops along the route. I think. He draws several Xs along the line. His hand coming to a stop on a particular forboding PATCH OF MOUNTAINS.Looks like Jericho was, the last town it glances before'. heading around the Linwood Mountains...Then it goes to the last stop.The Cities. So there it is. The Priestess narrows her eyes.But headin' to the Cities is suicide. The sun will kill `em -- there's nowhere to hide. Priest gazes at the map, deeply troubled.Beggar's Pass...it ain't gonna be easy. As if on cue the last rays of the sun wink out behind the mountain.If we push it hard we'll gain two days on 'em. Should be enough to get us a jump.That's the funny thing about time -- He dips his hand in the water and raises it, letting the liquid leak from between his fingers.It's always runin' right through my fingers.You ever regret it? Bein' a Priest?What about a husband, children...A family?What? You mean Mr. Laffs over there?He's going to kill her, isn't he? If. she's turned.There's things that can be done. She doesn't have to die.And how many of you Priests are left now? A long moment before she speaks..I'm sorry.,I- ee itl Hicks points, reaching the top of the mountain.Six-shooter pointed right at him.Tell me you won't kill her. Priest doesn't reply.Tell me...or I'll shoot you where you stand.Don't turn this into somethin' it's not.She's your kin, goddamit!Things can be done. Things to lessen the thirst. She can have a normal life, she doesn't have to die. Priest nods grimly.And what is that? Some special Priest code of honor? You don't get it. Your \"way' -- It's over!This ain't done. He lowers his gun and walks away. The two warriors stand together, the Priestess gazing at Priest...hedoesn't return it. Without a word, he heads back to his cycle. She doesn't see as his hand touches his stomach. It comes up red.My.tuxn now, Priest. BAMI He kicks the door inShit. With a WAIL, the vampires quickly scramble from their coffins, sharp talons scratching at the wood, snapping the planks. Desperate, he wrenches open the door, darting into --'Dam. He site on the floor, breathing hard, knowing this is as far as he goes. Gradually another sound becomes audible. Hicks listens, nervous. He holds his breath straining to hear. It's someone else's BREATHING.Lucy? it is. That's when he sees something. Glinting in the darkness, just below her lip. Something sharp.Lucy, my name is Sheriff Hicks...I'm here to take you home. No response. She seems almost catatonic. He reaches into his pocket, pulling out her photograph, showing it to her.I'm here with your uncle. That gets her attention, she looks at Hicks -- And she looks scared.Stay behind me. I'll hold `em off as long as I can BLAMI BL.AM! Hicks FIRES, bullets peppering the creatures as they HOWL -- but they keep at it, the thick chain stretched tight, ready to snap.Lucy? WHAM! A WOODEN. PLANK slams him over the head, knocking the gun from his hand. Woozy, he spins around to find Lucy standing over him, holding the plank above her head. He scoots back just as WHAM! the plank comes back down again, splintering apart across the floor.Lucy, wait She doesn't, jabbing at him with the broken plank, he dodges it, barely, but she keeps coming.We should jump!You knew they wouldn't make it. A long time before Priest answers.When you're finished -- You know where to find me. A tense beat then Priest GUNS the engine. Hicks and Lucy watching as he blazes towards the Cities, the sky above the color of hellfire.Leans against the backwall watching. Lucy glances his way... then shyly looks away.Just make sure she keeps on the tea. It's a special brew -- lessens the bloodthirst...something my granddad taught me. Aaron nods hopefully, squeezing his. daughter's hand.It doesn't have to be like this. Priest just stands, staring. Hick's hand curls around the revolver. Priest looks to the cabin, the challenge hanging in the airD= I t- -make dQ this.Nothing to worry about, just a coyote. Aaron smiles, happy enough to be with Lucy.", "clean_line": "beginning locked forever combat vampires quicker stronger gift flight quick glimpses bloody brutal battle men screaming talons ripping

Maybe your Master will know.Wh re is she?Your.Master'll be dead. He shoves the slab more, the light rays hanging just outside the edge. And now The Familiar begins to laugh, a horrible rattling sound. Something in his mood has shifted.Leaps in front. Blocking his way.Not yet. With a HORRIBLE SCREECH the Familiars attack, LAUNCHING at Priest and Hicks. Blades in the air.Now we can do this easy -- He tosses the BUTCHER KNIFE, it sticks in the ground a hairline from a Familiar's head.Or we can do this HARD -- Priest flings another BLADE. This one PLANTS in the leg of the Familiar. He HOWLS.Where is she?They get your gun arm?You're gonna need it.We don't want a fight. We're just looking for the girl. The vampire sneers and as it speaks the following -- one by one, the OTHERS drop from the sky, flanking him. They're scraggly, a little undernourished.You were murderers.We're not going anywhere until you tell us where she is.,,Yea though r walk through the Valley Of The Shadow Of Death x will fear no Evil -- \" The vampires laugh. Fangs glinting.No need. He'll the at first light. Priest goes to the Familiars still lying on the ground. They're sobbing, having lost everything in the world that mattered. Completely wrecked. He grabs one by the scruff of the neck.Make 'sense.Emerges through the hole, exhausted, the LEAD VAMPIRE'S HEAD in his hand dangling by its hair. He tosses the head and it rolls to Hicks' feet, fangs flashing up at him. Hicks stares at the ghastly visage. Unnerved.How's your arm?Usually. A BEAT as they listen to the popping of the fire. A tension hanging between them. Then -You don't have the stomach for it --head back to Haibridge right now. Hicks glares at Priest.Killing a vampire isn't like killing a man. They come at'you like an animal. Tooth for tooth.What?it just comes. Easy's got nothing to do with it. He pokes at the fire, it CRACKLES, feeding off the bodies. Something about the battle's opened him up. His guard's down.I take no pleasure in it. Killing. I know I've done more than my share -- Whatever they do to me I have it coming.Give me your gun.Give me your gun.Don't anticipate the trajectory of your target. Know it. He stomps his foot into the fire, launching a GLOWING COAL OF ASH into the air. Priest quickly raises the gun and FIRES, the ash explodes, raining fiery red sparks.I'm teaching you to kill vampires. No more wild shots --There's always-two points. A and B. Know the points and you'll know your target.I see ten crypts ...but only eight vampires. We find the missing, we'll find-Lucy.' What's the next nearest town?Then you better get a good night's sleep. This bunch was easy, their bloodlines watered down by man.How's your arm?You're a halfbreed. A BEAT as Hicks looks to the ground, when he speaks, it's in a voice just below his breath.Miracle?You saw angels?How many?These angels...di.d you ever see them during the day?Home?Vampires sometimes use abandoned structures as a perch. Watch for booby traps. And with that he enters the--Stay here. If anything comes up the steps that isn't me -- Shoot it. Before Hicks can reply,.Priest heads down the stairs, darkness swallowing him with every step.No.I should be asking you the same question.Where?Hicks. He starts down the tunnel. The Priestess quickly following.It's too big to fit down here. That's why you're still alive.Leaps from below, darting up the rock, taking advantage of the distraction, landing on the creature's back and wrapping his arms around its neck. Going for the deathlock. With a SHRIEK the creature WHIPS its head with crack force sending Priest flying. The Priestess, still in mid-drop, CATCHES him and they both hit the ground with their feet.Better to keep it contained. The vampire's lathered into an animal frenzy now, wailing and scuttling around the circular wall in crazy patterns. Suddenly -- with a stone shattering BOOM! it BURSTS through the hole, FLYING out into the night.Darts behind a boulder just in time. The creature's talons SCRAPING at the rock before it soars back to the sky, He pulls out his bible, grabbing and tossing a handful of --This was a Pureblood..I don't know. A BEAT filled with awkward silence -- when the Priestess kt\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd speaks it comes as a relief for both. An unloosening of things long held tight.I heard that one too.Did you go to The Clergy?Could be. The Priestess glances towards Hicks.He knows.He won't be able to. She pauses a moment, regarding him.Me too...Like what?It's a tomb. Big enough for an army.Only one way to find out...You said the next nearest town was Jericho.Then we better go see.We separate. Go through each building, see what we find.On the ground KNEELING. Head down, engaging in some kind of prayer. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they slowly approach, wondering what the hell is going on. As they get closer they see the fullWe're not going back.We already are. Something in the flames catches the Priestess's eye, in the charred remains of one of the corpses -- SOMETHING'S GLOWING. She wraps her arm, plunging her hand through the bones, pulling out the object. Quickly, she tosses it into a'barrel of water. it hisses, steam rising as it cools. Priest reaches into the barrel, his hand emerging with aHe wanted us to find it. It's a clue.Where? He draws one final X at the end of the line. Looks up.They won't have to. And with the SHRIEK of the train whistle we CUT TO:Retreat!Maybe they were scared of what we could do.With or without the Clergy...we're still Priests. And we're the only ones who can stop that train.No.Whatever happens. .. Wherever it is we go. We'll go together. At that.exact moment something inside Priest shifts just a little bit, a door opens -- never to be shut again.What in greater than God but more evil than the Devil? The poor have it, the rich need it -- and if you eat it...you'lldie.It's a riddle. The Priestess thinks about it.Yes. The good nights. Do you think maybe tonight...I know you're there. A slight sound, the mist whipping into a pool as if something just moved through it. Priest quickly turns but there's nothing there.Show yourself. A BEAT as he stands in the ether, waiting. Then -- WHOOSH! Qurye -M onen. ieadjna straight-for pi=.This isn't the time to settle old scores, Rune.I'm older now. We can almost bear Rune smile.It was a war, Rune.Finally showing your true colors. A beat. The Priestess looks at Hicks.He's a halfbreed. Hicks cocks the gun.You've been itching to do this since Nightshade.if she's turned...she's nobody's kin.It's our way.Shoot me and it won't matter if you find Lucy. You won't stop that train -- and you won't save her. The Priestess steps between them, looks at Hicks.Make sure you get on that train,is thrown! His beloved bike FLIPPING across the desert in wild arcs. He hits the earth with a painful skid, using the momentum to roll back onto his feet. He checks his stomach, the wound's of enina t,}g xnorA, staining his shirt bright red. No time for first aid as he turns just in time to seeSnaps the chain above his head, bullwhip style, LASHING out. The sound of metal shredding as it tangles in Rider #1's handlebars, the bike SWEEPING into the other, CRASHING in a tangled mess. With a SNARL the fallen riders LAUNCH at Priest. These vampires are different than the Nightshade tribe. Stronger, quicker. Squat bodies of clenched muscles and fangs.Rips the BLAST HELMETS off his two attackers. With a SCREECH, their faces burn, bodies instantly SLACKENING in the harsh sun. Priest CRUNCHES a vampire in the ribs, knocking the creature off his bike. In a flash, he FLINGS.a helmet into the housing of the last cycle, the bike nosedives, sending the rider across the desert. Eyes brimming with renewed fury, Priest picks up the cycle, VROOOOMI! GUNNING the throttle, mod. ROCKETING towards the train...Seemingly from out of nowhere, motors up to the train car riding the vampire cycle. He grabs onto a gun barrel and SWINGS into an arc, lifting himself off the bike and -.How? Black Hat smiles, baring hi fangs..They turned you.By murdering innocents?who?So this is how you go about it? One by one killing every last remaining Priest?Yours.I don't believe you.With ferocious instinct, he launches forward, feet digging into the metal. The two bodies COLLIDE w th Mic impact. Rolling across the roof, bodies twisting to the edge before FLIPPING onto the next car. The warriors rise, locked in a furious coil.as WHOOSHI train car after train car passes beneath them. Each leaping at j ust the right moment to land onto the next. But Priest is,outmatched. As they hit the final car, Priest flies across the roof catching the edge with his hand just before he goes over, his body dangling over the side. Exhausted and bloodied.Give her to me! Hurry!-- They'11.get through the door any second! Give her to mei Screeching, ANOTHER VAMPIRE makes it through the opening, Hicks quickly taking him down in one crack shot. He picks Lucy up, handing her to Priest. Priest disappears with her, Hicks climbing down behind just as -- the chain finally SNAPS and the door BURSTS open with screeching vampires! Hicks BLASTS away but there's too many of them, they keep coming. He drops into the hole --Not until we stop the trains But now Hicks isn't even looking at him, his attention caught up in the horrible sight waiting ahead of them.What happens next happens fast: Priest GRABS Hicks, folding his body around both he and Lucy, hands coming together in prayer, feet leaving the train as -- E ERYTH ggas BLACK The sound of a heartbeat.A threshold. A zone of transition. A BRIGHT FLASH -- we see the TRAIN collide with the. Priestess. The massive grill of the engine CRUMPLING AROUND HER as if smashing into a building. She doesn't move.

MMMM gQES BLACK A BRIGHT FLASH -- and now Priest is falling through the air, his body shielding Hicks and Lucy, train care skipping across the earth, careening through the air.He stands, bruised and bloody, staring at the sky. Watching. A dazed Hicks beside him, Lucy in his arms as she comes to. A HORRENDOUS SCREECH fills the air. Led by the Purebloods, HUNDREDS OF VAMPIRES fly out from within the broken cars, taking to the sky in a massive black swarm, tangling together in flowing shapes. Beautiful. Terrifying. Then in one horrible instant -- They TURN as if guided by an unseen hand, flying towards the Cities. Sensing the blood that awaits.No, they're not.She knew. He turns to THE ENGINE -- its grinning teeth grill CAVED IN as if smashed by the very hand of God.Do you want me to?\"You shall wash me and I shall be made whiter than snow.

No belief, no voice to guide them through the wilderness. Sound familiar? Priest doesn't reply, warily eyeing him.Lack of faith.

By helping them discover' the mastery within themselves.By putting them in touch with a higher power.Me.
