{"Detroit-Rock-City": {"HAWK": {"raw_line": "Thank you, Cleveland! You're a great crowd. But after three and a half hours of kick-ass rock and seven encores on top of that, I'm sorry to say that this time we really gotta get back to our hotel rooms and fuck some groupies.Lex, quit trying to always jinx things. Don't worry, dudes. Nobody's missing that concert tomorrow night.Jam, listen up.Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary.Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.Anyway, listen up. They're gone!The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!He's got'm!Trip, he took your jacket by mistake. You must be wearing Jam's.Cool.Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?Both you assholes, SHADDAP!Enough of the mom-bashing, all right? Lex's mom is cool about us crashing over here while she's out of town. And if it weren't for Trip's mom, we wouldn'ta smoked that fine Panama Red last night. So leave the women who gave you life out of it. They're both cool.Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.YO, DOOFUS!Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.They're what?All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.As they say in the Tampon biz, see you next period.What are you, high?For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here.Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!You're way out of your league, Elvis.We're clear, dudes.A skirt just came around the corner.That's Sherry VanHafton.Whoa... she just farted.Weird...Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.Fuckin' A! Woooooo!Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.I'm afraid our constipated little friend is right this time, Trip. There is a catch.Our band \"Mystery\" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?Damn straight we are.And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check?Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.Curly.Ok, dudes, follow my lead.As I was saying, follow my lead. And maintain. Elvis just showed up.Five second rule, boys. See you on the other side.Yeah, Elvis.....Your ass on a lunch tray.On your marks and...Fire!Elvis, you ain't nothin' but a hot dog.Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.Yeah, I'm Philip McNutly.Ten even.If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?Tell the Big Guy not to mention it.Shit! This is such a lousy view. How the hell are we gonna know when he's lit?It's okay, we're old buds of Father McNulty... How's it hangin', padre?That was another dude. Anyway, we're here to take our bud Jam to the big satanic KISS concert tonight. Okay with you?Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!Shit! Anybody know how long it takes to fix a flat?Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.What's in Sandusky?Only a car full of guidos and stellas would ride someone's ass on a two- lane road and beep.What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?What the fuck!Hey, disco dude, it's cool...Could be.It could... bake on?Okay, Kenny? I don't mean to drain your keg or anything, but could you speed up this process? Don't get me wrong, we'd love to stand here and get shit on by the cast of Saturday Night Fever, but we're also on a schedule. So step on it.No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi. So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.It's not, huh? Well, then, tell me......what exactly did my mother say last night?You heard me, prick. What did my mother say last night?How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?Right, stella, and we'll deserve it. But let's really make it worth their while.By the way, when Kenny wakes up could you give him a message for me. Tell him, quote, Kool and the gang bite my bag, motherfucker, unquote.Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.Well, they may not make movies about four dudes going to a KISS concert. But if they ever did, the four dudes most certainly would not stop and pick up a stranded disco bunny.Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.The Village People? They're fags! You're a fag hag!You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.Hey, if you don't like that one, maybe you'll think it's funny when we throw your ass out the goddamn car!Why don't you kiss my hairy crack?There it is!Ample time to grab our tickets at the station. See, up ahead. W.A.R.P.Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.What was that D.J.'s name again?Simple Simon?We're right behind you, Simo. Just wanted to thank you in advance for handing over those burly-ass tix me and my buds won this morning.Well, here we are, dudes. One hour and thirty minutes away from the concert of the century... ticketless. All thanks to Wile E. Coyote, Super- Fucking Genius over here.Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.Now listen up. Here's the game plan.Cool, bro, now listen up...Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. I got... twenty-five.Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize.Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.Still too risky for my money. We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection......at twenty-thirty hours.For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there.Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.See you at 8:30, Jam. Later. Dudes? Later.Dude, this is all I got.Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.Like to sign up for the contest.Hawk.Got any KISS?Yeah, a man's drink......Dickey.I'm gonna need all the help I can get tonight.What's that?Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.Whoa... she is a killer.Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...I-I c-can't...You're right, Dicky. I gotta do it for KISS. Gotta put a bag over its head and Do it for KISS.Wow. I feel a hundred times better!Thanks lady.Maestro? As you were.Come on, dude, we got a bunch of frisky felines waiting for some entertainment! The show must go on!Thanks, miss.Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.Huh?Thanks.What the hell is that?Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.Who's Whiskey Dick?My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw......holy shit!Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up. What's next? Projectile diarrhea? Man. What a stud, huh?You love him?No, I mean... you love your son?And he loves you back, doesn't he?Well, shame on him if he doesn't.My mom died of a heart attack while she was having me. Man, I wish I had known her for even one day. If they ever invent a time machine, that's what I'm doing. Going back in time to meet my mom. I'm gonna say, \"Mrs. Pitchford?... or Miss Williams, depending on when I show up. You don't know me, but I'm your kid from the future. Just wanted to thank you for the blue eyes, pug nose and for tying the knot with a guy who didn't mind diaper detail... Oh, and, uh... cut down on the red meat, will ya?\"Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me....Thanks.Whoa! Whoa! WHOA! That better not be the last ticket! I hope you have another one for me!Fuck me!Any luck?Tickets?Well, dudes, the only way we're gonna see KISS this tour is by some fuckin' miracle.Nah. Couldn't be.Take it easy, Elvis. Don't do anything crazy. Just give me the tickets before someone gets hurt.Go ahead, Jam.Dude, you gotta let us in!

"What the fuck, Trip? That's my bass!Shit! It's Jam's mom!I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.Trip, you fuckin' asshole.You spilled my Sea Monkeys all over the bed.Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.Shit, that dork is Jam.Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!Wanna bet.Check!Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? Quit acting all squeezed out.Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.I've been in love with her since the second grade.I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.Heh-heh, sorry.Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...We won?!The Chinese have a proverb: \"That which appears too good to be true, usually is.\" There's gotta be a catch.But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!We are not stealing my mom's car.Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.Sunday, but...Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiarVery funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?Hello summer detention.Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.Now, how are we gonna do this?Not looking like that, Mr. Rogers.We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.My mom's hubcap!Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!Holy shit! We just pissed off the Incredible Hulk, his idiot half brother and two circus clowns.The paint!Not so fast, stella.Oh, thanks for letting us draw from your ample make-up supply. You must have the entire Revlon factory in your purse!What is it with you, Jam? You got a thing for that... thing?Your clothes may say disco, but your eyes say rock 'n' roll, baby.That last remark fell about 30 yards away from making any sense whatsoever.Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.Curly driving, Hawk. We still got two hours to spare.Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?Yeah, it's like you're possessed by The Flying Nun, or something.Uh... dudes?DUDES!Where's the Volvo?I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?But we took the keys?Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation....I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that......Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.I think we should try sneaking in.Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all \"re-enter\" the concerto. Voila!I can't believe I'm actually entertaining the notion of sneaking in. I oughta have my cranium examined.Whoa. Danger Will Robinson.Shit!Keep it together, Lex. Anything worth fighting for is worth dying for.WHOOOOAAA!This is real. This is not a dream! This is real! I've pierced the inner circle!Oh, God, they're in there!Dogs! Why did it have to be dogs!Wake up, Lex! Wake up, man! This part's gotta be a nightmare!God, if you ever get me outta this, I swear I will never masturbate again!I REALLY MEAN IT THIS TIME!Okay, okay, you're pissed off. I can see this. So... Maybe what we need... ah-ha.Play some frisbee, poochies?Alright! I give up! I hearby and forthwith defer my destiny to you mutts. I may be an intelligent, upright, walking, homo-fucking sapien, but you fleabags are a force of nature. So, I'm just gonna sit here and wait for you to decide. If you let me live, I thank you. If you bite my head off, I'll die knowing I did all I could. It's up to you.Well, how do you like that?Whoa! Whoa!You sonsofbitches could tickle a guy to death, y'know that? Sure you do... Sure you do...I'm here for the girl and the car. You can try to stop me, but I must warn you, it may be hazardous to your health.Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make... Hounds of hell? Say hello to dinner!One foot out of that office and your asses are Alpo!Aaaayyyyy!You got a phone in there?Call the cops.This oughta be enough to get you to Disco Inferno, Christine.No can do. But I made a promise to get you to that disco, and we KISS maniacs are men of our word. Besides... you're pretty cool... for a stella, I mean.I found the Volvo.No...

They make very scary movies that start out like that.It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.Trip!

I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.Sometimes I think I don't deserve friends as good as you guys.It was stolen!I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.I got...Wait! I know how we can get in!But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.Oh... dear... Lord!!Mom, what're we...?Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.Yeah.No.Beth? I can't believe it.Are you waiting for confession? I thought you were Jewish?I don't care. I wanna hear more.Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.Right, slow...Uhh, tying my shoe.Actually, yes. Last year I walked out of a candy store with a Reggie Bar I hadn't paid for, but went back and apologized the next day.I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?Ann Arbor?Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again.Bye.I'm gonna ask you nicely first. Mom, can I have my drumsticks back?Again, can I have my drumsticks?I know, mom, I've been in trouble for about twelve hours now! Hellooooo!?I'm gonna be spending the next two years of my life at St. Bernard's Boarding School, remember?! I'm gonna be outta your hair till I'm a legal adult, remember?! That way, all you have to do is go to church, light a candle, pray to a little statue for me, and voila! All is forgiven and forgotten, right mom?!! Then, you can spend your days in guilt-free pursuit of more constructive activities like telling everybody else how screwed up their lives are! That way you no longer need the patience and understanding required to communicate on some normal level with your own child!!! And that way you don't even have to think about how tough it was for you when you were growing up, and it's a good thing too. Cause if you did, you'd realize what a LOUSY, GODDAMN, SHITTY- ASS, PARENT YOU ARE!!!I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!For the last time, mom.
