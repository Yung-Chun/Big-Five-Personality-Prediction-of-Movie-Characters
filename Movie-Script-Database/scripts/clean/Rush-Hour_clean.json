Even for what it's worth now.That sure cheers me right up.One cut... two assholes in the hospital... Yep.Well, another day of baby-sitting my favorite bunch of people...They're not gonna transfer me.

Chopper's on its way.Check it out! Ahead, on the right!Yeah... but it seems too easy... I'll move up; he won't suspect a civilian car. Stay back, then get on his ass when I signal. We'll box him in.If the Mod Squad gets in your way, don't be shy about getting 'em out.He's gonna wrap it around something!Oh, shit...I'm in no mood...Let's get back to the Consulate.His Security Chief. There was a civilian with them -- fifteen-year-old girl from across the street. We're trying to reach the parents.I'm not so sure what happened here. Something smells. Asshole was acting like he wanted us to spot him...Start a trace!Yeah, you didn't know. And I'm Meryl Streep.Say you want to talk to the kids...Ask Dave if he knows how to find the phone's serial number.Oh, Jesus, those're explosives! Look at the TV -- this was just taken.-- Goddamn Negotiator's the last thing we need! This asshole sound like he was interested in bargaining?...You're gonna just pay up, count on his good nature to return the family?!-- They know their phones are tapped! They tap our fucking phones!This Consulate is my responsibility....Our worst enemy'll be the city. There are events gearing up all around town, and a dozen world leaders arriving. Add the Friday rush hour and usual L.A. bad behavior and it'll be a nightmare out there by 3 PM. It all works to the advantage of the kidnapper, hinders our pursuit efforts... You don't agree?You see one word of Peoples'- Liberation, Holy-Jihad, Revolutionary whatever-it-is-we're-pissed-off-about- this-week bullshit in this entire letter?-- Already doing it. We're coordinating with the Secret Service, the NSA and the CIA.If she'd changed her name when we got married, I wouldn't have to.My ass.-- Hey, do I go to the torture chambers in your prisons, tell you how to do your job?I'll coordinate the drop.It sucks.-- I expect him to expect it. He'll check the cash with an RF detector... Meaning he'll find this one. This only has a quarter-mile range, but on a frequency too low to detect. And I doubt the asshole will have an X-ray machine or a metal detector.Gosh, you're right. It could undermine their self-esteem and spoil their chances for rehabilitation.Just tell me if we can use it.Nothing but physical surveillance.Well, it ain't gonna happen. Not again...Shit... no way we can set up a stake- out in... -more-Must've bought a house same time we did.There's about a hundred ways he can scurry off like a cockroach from here... So spread out.Fuck! Okay, stay back. It's not like he'll be hard to see in that truck. Which way's he heading?We're made! Gotta grab him!Watch it! We need him alive!FBI. Call our office, they'll take care of you.Just don't kill yourself, you piece of shit...Helicopter or two would be nice!Not just now, dear...I coulda had a ranch... maybe some horses... but no, we moved to L.A.He's on foot, at the base of the elevator tower!Goddammit! He's in a blue Geo!Fingerprint it. He's not gonna tell us where to find the hostages... -more-Miranda! We need a copter, pronto! Get back to his van. There were no plates, but check the VIN, look it over, then meet us at the Consulate.Go!...Scrounge us some bodies: National Guard, State Troopers, CHPs, local PD's, meter maids --Look, I don't need you to tell me how fucked we are!Let's take stock. We've got a picture of where he hid the family, and recordings of his calls --Same with his fingerprints. But that means we need high-quality image and data transmission. We can piss away ten minutes coptering this shit to our offices in Westwood, or we can use your surveillance equipment.-- You want to play games, fine.South Korean Consulate's just down the street -- want to take a listen?Shitcan that thing, will you?!Got a digital scanner?You might want to drop a few bucks at Radio Shack and get with the decade. Dave -- get in here. Bring your computer, a city map, and the tapes of the ransom calls.This is Carson in L.A. There's a set of prints coming over. Narrow the search criteria: Male, thirties, Caucasian... French, Belgian, Swiss, maybe Canadian. Try kidnappers and bombers first. We need an answer in fifteen minutes.Dazzle me.We got one of the best sound guys right here in town... Newman in Audio Analysis...Get those tapes transferred to a sound guy. We need ambient and background analysis, the whole enchilada.No... 'cause you're fat.Jesus H. Christ...Do it.Any significance?Get the Bureau on it.Look, goddammit, you start skipping no-chance-in-hell leads, we can all quit and go to the beach right now.He grabbed the family at 8:30. The last certain visual we had was just before his van went into the alley on La Cienega at 8:42. He called the Consulate at 9:30.He probably waited a while to pad the time -- he wanted us know the family was still alive... ...So these crazy bastards wouldn't throw a premature shit hemorrhage, but he didn't want to call too soon, either. I say they're within 15 to 20 minutes, via surface streets, of where we last saw them.-- Bet he doubled back.Cute. He signed the name of the Allied Commander during the Korean War. Maybe he was a political.Who's got those kinds of skills: Electronics, vehicle customizing, computers, explosives?I'm going to the kidnapping site.Great, we'll hire a bus.Jump a copter to the Consulate. See if the manufacturer sells to the public. Find out what shops use their stuff; put people on the phones with a description of the perp.Twelve-gauge shell filled with magnesium and ignition powder. Shit's worse than napalm -- Geneva Convention outlawed it for warfare.Easy -- you can buy 'em mail order. Where's the Consulate's car?Shut up!Find it! How many bulletproof Mercedes could be cruising around Crenshaw?I hate this fuckin' town.Wasted trip: Witnesses say he was working alone, and he was a vicious son of a bitch. Old news.We going steady?Looks like the wheel of a car.I thought that about all of them. C'mon, think, dammit!!Call the outdoor advertising companies. Get the location of all the billboards for Japanese cars within our search parameters.Say what?Yeah, the U.S. is behind the whole thing. And we're knocking our heads, trying to find your people, just for show.Let's grab a few beers, kick back 'til five o'clock rolls by. Then maybe we can have a war over it. I think that's a great idea, seeing as how you fuckers have needed your clocks cleaned for fifty years now!Hey, I'm not the only one with a rep around the office... \"Dr. Knoll-It- All.\"Miranda... Shit.Everyone shut up! Guy on vacation, the Canadian --Six foot, sandy hair, spooky eyes?I need a full name, address, anything you got!That's appropriate... In 30 seconds you're gonna give me Paul Javal's shoe size.Carson...Whatta you got?How high up are they?Okay -- high-rises in our search area. Eight stories or higher.Sabatini! What about that billboard?LAPD will have a record of all emergency vehicles running Code 3 at 9:32 AM. Get their starting point and their destination.Where's that fuckin' address?!Get his Driver's License number; Social; bank accounts; charge cards; club memberships... find out what movies he rented. Get whoever's closest to the Auto Shop to get in there, interview everybody.Hey, he watched the news... Everyone knows the U.S. will do anything to avoid trouble with a mad-dog country.-- Quit apologizing for me!Sounds like her aim's a little low.Apartment 1060! He's in a high-rise! Sabatini -- you're with us. She's got the field experience.There's a TV station a couple blocks away. We'll land on their pad. K-EYE. Clear it with 'em. Have a SWAT team assemble, but tell 'em to hang back unless we need 'em.Oh, great, the media... It's the goddamn traffic girl!We can't get into that right now...This works out, I'll play the fuckin' banjo for you.We're hoofing it.Whoa... FBI..!How the hell you get here so fast?Terrific. Who else is here?Tell 'em to be cool. We're going up. Give me your master key.Wait here.I'm in. It's empty, but sit tight while I look around.NO! --I said keep everyone back!!Get out of my sight.What's the status?Hurry it the hell up.I should've known she'd come up.-- \"Should've.\" Shit, there's a familiar word. That day... I was there soon enough. We should've rushed 'em, before they could finish setting up...Twelve bodies -- only the hostages.-- Those kids were ten years old! Same age as the Han boy...C'mon! Who's pulling Javal's bank records? What about cross-referencing possible aliases? We got 33 minutes!Go to the bottom of the list, work back through the last 12 hours.Wait... go back... the one at seven this morning...Get down!MIRANDA!Get the fuck out of here!Shit, it's like a Godzilla movie out here!Miranda..!I want you to get out of here......The Colonel hired Javal, made it look like he was working alone. Then he made sure Javal got killed, so we'd never find your family -- and they'd have an excuse to drop their bomb. But what's in it for 'em?Negative -- his car's armored! And we need the bastard alive!!One of yours? What the hell do you need heat- seeking rockets for in L.A.?And they call me Mr. Overkill. Dave, what do you know about...Strela-2 anti-aircraft rockets?-- Skip the goddamn trivia! I need range, guidance, arming method, anything we can work with...That Kraut-mobile have any weaknesses you'd like to tell me about?No shit...This were a Hyundai you wouldn't be.Get me out of here...Anybody see him?Dave... You're sure those rockets are heat-seeking?Just keep working your leads...This is Carson. I need a copter.Something small and nimble. Anybody... come in low, from the south... I'm on an ambulance by the 9th Street exit.I'll make him open the sunroof. Someone can shoot tear gas or a percussion grenade inside.No way. I couldn't stand making so many people happy.You?! I wanted a police copter!Wrong-o...Got 'im -- looks like he's headed for the 101.Pull hard to the left, on my signal...Now!Well, what the hell were you doing out there?Oh, for Christ's sake... Hold on!I'll just use my outstanding people skills.That car's like a rock, right?Dave...Anything else come through?Not yet...You're shittin'... Where?!...Have the Manager evacuate the complex. Find out which unit the family's in, but don't let anyone go in 'til we get there.\"Fuck-you\" pumps??Apartment number would be real helpful, gang...Okay... work with me here!DON'T!We have to go out the window.Too risky. Let's concentrate on getting you out of here.Sound detectors?Pressure sensors. Use 'em in convertibles: Bad guy sits on your seat, he sets the alarm off. These are rigged backwards -- get up, you set 'em off.Nope. But I've had some car alarms in my day. For all the goddamn good they do...Slide your arm forward... Watch the meter... Keep the pressure on the armrest with your elbow...It'll squeeze the sensor, duplicate the weight of your arm... Okay... pick it up.Low-tech solution... Lean back... Carefully.Nag, nag, nag...You'll be over in five seconds...Tell 'em I'm gonna release the hook and ride down on the line.Release the cable from your side! Get out of here!...I'll call you next week.The Bureau.

C'mon, you'd die of boredom if we ever sold this house and moved.Lots of people bought at the top of the market...I don't know why we even talk about it. The city's not the problem. So we move. It wouldn't matter. What's that saying: \"Wherever you go, there you are.\"I hope you're current on your tetanus booster. Was it worth it?Ask for a transfer.I'm wondering whether to believe him when he says he's strictly motivated by money.I still want to check the MO against known politicals, terrorists --Have someone talk to the LAPD, give them a cover story for the media about the crash on La Cienega.I'm so enjoying this opportunity to finally work together...Everything indicates he's working alone. And his concerns do seem to be solely about the money... so I agree that he's only using the Summit and the tension with North Korea to create extreme motivation to pay the ransom.But it means we can get on with it.Get one thing straight, Mr. Walther. If the Bureau had listened to Pete, Beverly Thrift never would've happened.He'll expect a homing device --Why must you always refer generically to criminals as \"assholes?\"You been reading my magazines in the bathroom again?He's really exhibiting pressured speech... big effort here to sound calm. Same with his vocabulary... if he were in control, he wouldn't feel such a need to sound that way.If we needle him he could get sloppy and give us an opening, but I'm not going to risk it. This is the worst kind of perpetrator: anything makes him deviate from his carefully- scripted plan, he could become extremely volatile.Do we have back-up if the bleeper fails?It's real important we don't lose him. He didn't go through all the trouble of designing that bomb not to use it.Yes, please go ahead...-- I'm only here to see that everyone gets what they want --The drop is at the DeMille barn, across from the Hollywood Bowl. You're to leave the money in the center of the parking lot.Remember, Pete... we're dealing with a customer with a lot of rage.What happened?All right... Carefully...Love to be in the loop on this...Stop! The clock's running! Arguing is a luxury we can't afford! -more-Well, the normal procedure is to negotiate with the perpetrator...-- That's right! We can send them to our experts for analysis...Colonel, you saw the perp. Describe him to the Ambassador, see if it's anyone he knows.Photo enhancement... Isn't there some amazing tech with the LAPD --Given his behavior, this orange residue... I'd say Desoxyn, 25 mg. Amphetamines.It's consistent with the lone wolf scenario: A handful of these is pure bravery-in-a-bottle, 'til the psychosis and paranoia kick in. We could check pharmacy records, on the remote chance he got them legally... if we had a couple of weeks, that is.Forget it. It's a waste of manpower.That gives him about fifty minutes to get to his location, move and secure the hostages, and activate his time bomb.The most densely-populated part of the L.A. basin. This narrows it down to about 200,000 dwellings.He was traveling west --C'mon, that's total conjecture --You're telling me?No. The phony ice cream truck, the booby-trapped chairs... he could've -more-I want to talk to the witnesses.Then how did he get it?He means all of us \"you people.\"We talked about these billboards, when we were car shopping! Four- door... they make a wagon, too. Something Japanese... God, what was it? Toyota... Mazda... Honda... You thought it had no character.You think!! You were there, too!Pete! Christ, you're self-indulgent! There's nothing but anger and cynicism left inside you, so they're all you can express any more. No wonder everyone in the Bureau thinks you're such a nutcase!You've been dying to tell me that...Downtown, Century City, Westwood corridor, Museum Row, Mid- Wilshire... North of Sunset Strip there's a few...And have them narrow their foot- searches to areas around high-rises.This sure was a ballsy move for a car-alarm installer.Ambassador --Quit giving me reasons to!There still could be accomplices. If there are, they'll hear us in the helicopter.Traffic person.Sorry...Guess what, Sister... you're about to spend the next five years in a penitentiary for interfering with a federal investigation.Sorry...I like what you've done with the place...Stop it!Pete --The Bureau never would've let you. They want it by the book: talk them out.You were a greenhorn. It wasn't your decision. You can't keep living as such a raw nerve, never sleeping --Camry! The billboard! Toyota Camry! Where are the numbers for the outdoor ad companies?Go..!I heard. I'm in the copter.Shut up and keep your eyes on the road. That's my goddamn car. Dave? You staying on top of the research?Listen: the best way to help them is to stay at your computer. If any information comes in, holler. Okay?-- You don't \"work with\" rockets, Peter!Stay back. LAPD's putting up a roadblock.Still heading north on the 110.Are you out of your mind?Switch to a secure channel. What on earth are you thinking?Pete, you haven't gone... suicidal or anything on me, have you?You fucking lunatic!!Sorry...You're completely deranged!
