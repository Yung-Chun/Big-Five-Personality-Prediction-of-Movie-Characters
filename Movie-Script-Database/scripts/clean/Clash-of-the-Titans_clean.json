I was the boy's tutor years ago.He knows nothing and believes himself an ordinary man. He has never left his village. He can be overconfident, but it is from inexperience, not arrogance.

You've grown tall and strong since my departure. Perseus laughs at his old nickname and holds Amoun at arm's length.I am honored to serve the King as an advisor. His Magi Strategos.And a celebration of the treaty. A Page enters and whispers in Kepheus' ear. Kepheus is irritated.Perhaps the thought of her new life has made her frantic to enjoy the vestiges of her old one.Follow the lights and the sound of profane music.. Leviathan -- First dweller of the deep. Hewn by Tiamat from the dark blood of the earth.... All monsters of the sea are but shadows of Leviathan the Kraken -- colossal, rapacious, and nigh indestructible. The men turn to Kepheus; when he raises his face, he looks exhausted.Perseus! You had something you wanted to say to the King? All eyes turn to Perseus, who shrinks before them, self- conscious.You're 'listening'? We're talking about the precious life of your betrothed. Perseus meets his gaze, confused.Exactly! A newcomer with a fresh perspective. Share your thoughts with the King, your future father- in-law. The ministers are puzzled by Amoun's persistence. Perseus, uncertainly --I sent for him, Lord. This good man raised Perseus from infancy. He will help him now.Majesty, we can seek the counsel of the Norn Sisters of Skolothia. They know the hidden ways of the Gods. If Leviathan can be slain, they'll know how to do it.My King, with your permission... The King assents, seemingly lost. Amoun speaks to Perseus.I'll give you a map and much more. I'll go with you and bring a small band of comrades to help you on your mission. We can leave at first light. Diokles, the map. The men move to the work area, where the Aide selects a map from dozens. Something catches Perseus' eye.We head north on the Via Dahlia. If we can make it to the Disputed Territories... MOVE IN ON the tip of Amoun's pointer on the. we'll join the Cleon desert legion, the most formidable unit in all the army... With their escort, we can safely reach our destination in Skolothia, which lies to the east... We DISSOLVE THROUGH the map and pointer, which remain LIGHTLY SUPERIMPOSED over the following:Our guides will be Mongke and Tamburlane, father and son monster hunters from the Kingdom of the Iron Horde. Next, THE PRAETORIAN GUARD, commanded by a square-jawed old soldier, DRACO. His men, in heavy armor: KOSMO, Draco's lieutenant, and the soldiers ABAS, ICOS, THAD, BOREAS, KRIKOR, and POLLUC.Our escort will be a detachment of the Praetorian Guard, led by Commander Draco -- the staunchest security force in Joppa. Next, on a stunning pale horse, a pale rider -- the Wilting Girl.I thank the stars we have her. Besides, she takes her orders from an authority much greater than I. Next, Spyros; horseback riding is not one of his many skills. Behind him, Perseus and Amoun ride talking --No, Perseus!Your birth was written in the stars. I sought you out and took it as my cause to teach you.Understanding that is the first step toward knowledge.You can honor Boreas by the way you act from this moment forward.It is not your choice. You are what you are. Amor fati, Perseus. 'Love thy fate.'Concentrate on the task before you. All answers will come with that.A fierce group. Trained to fight... Amoun's DESCRIPTION CONTINUES as we --. behind enemy lines. A LOOKOUT peers into the dark desert, listening. Now he HEARS something, turns and shouts to another SENTRY:. They've been chasing Djinn Raiders in the mountains for years.Yes, Godly zealots, supposedly insane. They fight like Hades himself is keeping score... From the dark SURROUNDING DESERT, WE SEE the Night Patrol ride into camp and dismount... That's how the Desert Legion came to be called 'God-slayers.' I'm not ashamed to say I'll be relieved to have their protection the rest of the way... Amoun's Voice FADES. TILT DOWN TO the barren, desert flats. Suddenly, a miracle transforms the moonlitYou wanted to know about Djinn Raiders. Here they are.Muster to me!Come on! You can pass through! Draco bolts for the barrier. A Lotophagi spears Kosmo, killing him. Draco slides inside the swarm. He looks back at Kosmo in horror. Polluc slashes zombies and runs toward the swarm. He's almost there when one of the Lotophagi lands on him, sinking fangs into his skull. Polluc sticks his sword into the creature; they both fall over dead. Icos and Spyros fight their way to the swarm and jump inside. Mongke and Tamburlane kill a Lotus-eater and leap over the corpse into the protected circle. The tide of HOWLING and SHRIEKING Lotophagi claw at the barrier of insects to no avail.Only humans can penetrate the shield! Perseus takes quick stock of the group inside the swarm, thinking.No! It's too late for her!Have you learned nothing? If you break out now, we're all at risk. On the boulder, Kalibos grabs Vidalia's white flesh. Perseus is anguished; he knows he's in love.Because of you. You're the reason they saved us.Why don't you ask him?They have no mouths. That doesn't mean they do not speak.The Pillar of Moirai. Lair of the Norn Sisters.They're witches in the form of Strix. Not a pleasant sight, a Strix. They have powerful magic and dreadful habits. Baby-eaters, among other things. But they owe me a favor. When the war broke out, they lent their power to men against the Gods in exchange for infant sacrifice. Tiamat struck them blind for their treachery. When they came for help, I fashioned them an artificial eye, for their Second Sight.(pleased with hisLikewise, Urd. I seek your counsel.You know already... of course.Surely the beast from the sea has some weakness. You owe me this answer at least.No, good Sisters... the son of Zeus. The Strix react in horror and all land on the same monolith.You know the answer sure as you already knew the question. The Norn Sisters confer, enclosed in a curtain of wings.They're lying, Perseus. Perseus studies the Sisters, weighing his response.The Rape of Medusa? Everyone falls silent. The soldiers shift, suddenly nervous.Medusa was a tender young woman once -- a mortal creature of such rare beauty as to tempt even the Gods. One night, on the road home, she caught the eye of the God of Deserts and Entropy -- Set the Void.She hastened to hallowed ground, thinking the Goddess Tiamat would protect her in her temple. But the God Set followed. A SHADOW passes swiftly over the shattered pitcher, in pursuit.He ravished her on the cold floor. She felt the heartless passion of a God.Despoiled and broken in the shadow of Tiamat's altar, she prayed for comfort and pleaded for courage... But the Goddess of the Deep regarded Medusa with disdain. The prayers of such a frail and filthy mortal angered Tiamat. A bust of Tiamat chiseled from black crystal opens her BLAZING eyes, THROWING A LONG SHADOW OF MEDUSA onto the wall.The Goddess twisted young Medusa into a loathsome new thing... The contorting shadow shows the transformation. Legs twist and snap and become a slithering tail. Snake heads wriggle from her skull... and cursed her with a hateful stare that petrifies to stone all that look upon her. Grave silence. Draco realizes he's burned his dinner on the fire. Spyros shakes his head. Perseus just stares, a believer. NOISES come from the fog: SPLINTERING ICE; SLOSHING OARS. A SHAPE emerges -- an ice-cutting THREE-TIERED GALLEY, oars moving with precision.Charon's ferry.The Temple of Tartaros... Medusa's lair. Mongke and Tamburlane exchange words and point. They allMedusa must have turned them to stone. Perseus swings his sickle, measuring its balance, and adjusts his shield. He checks a canvas sack on his belt.Jove the Father is another name by which Zeus was known. This milestone dates from when city states were named for their patron deities. Perseus, filling his canteen, peers at the marker as Amoun uses one hand to cover the letters \"-VE\" and the other the letters \"-TER.\"'The Polis of Jove Pater' is the ancient name of --Yes, Joppa... once the most sacred site in the worship of Jove.. and transforms Joppa into the new church of Tiamat. The ancient abode of Zeus...We should stop for the night.Why don't we stop here tonight? Spyros smiles, looking off after Perseus.This is my fault. I've permitted .this infatuation to progress too far.If by some miracle you survive this encounter with Leviathan, the hand of the Princessa is your reward.Are you so selfish? Would you risk everything for the foolish love of -- A BLAST of HOT DESERT WIND blows into the Shrine. The berries turn brown and shrivel. Amoun grabs his chest. Perseus and Vidalia crumple in agony. SET THE VOID COMES INTO THE SHRINE. Amoun tries to invoke a spell, but Set touches his chest and Amoun splits open. Set points at Vidalia, slamming her into the earthen wall. The God is there in an instant, strangling her. Perseus staggers up and swings his sickle, but Set points, ripping the weapon from Perseus' hand. It flies across the shrine and sinks with a CLANG into the tablet that once held Vidalia's true name. Still choking Vidalia, Set grabs Perseus' arm. Perseus doubles over, paralyzed by the God's touch. Suffocating, Vidalia FADES MORE.

How does a stranger walk unmolested into the Throne Room of the King?Help him with what?But how? Perseus has no idea.With what army?

Two simple fishermen.Living at the mercy of the sea so long has convinced me some adventures are unexpected and some dangers unavoidable. It's all in your attitude.The Kraken is just another big fish. Perseus smiles, but is not as sanguine.Draco, tell me what this -- Everyone is standing perfectly still. DARK FIGURES surround them. The transformed Cleon Legion lurches INTO VIEW. The only resemblance to the soldiers they were is their armor.. Now they're monstrous creatures: LOTOPHAGI.It's no wonder they shy away from all strangers. Perseus looks ahead, where the Expedition is parting company with the Djinn Raiders. only one of the Djinn is staying -- SHAIKH SULEIMAN, a veiled priest.Stay away from my boy! Without touching him, the Shaikh throws the fisherman over his head, where he lands hard with an \"UMPH!\" Perseus jolts awake. He reaches for his sword, but has none. Spyros struggles to his feet to start another charge. Suleiman raises his hand and freezes Spyros in his position. The Shaikh's veil has fallen, revealing his frightening countenance: scaled skin of charred wood; eyes like slots in a furnace. Perseus listens to theTell us now! The Strix are torn, frightened.

It's not personal. Seeing you makes it real. I think a man should make his own decisions. I won't be the pawn of a King or a God.

I'm listening.I'm a newcomer here. I would not presume to tell these men --I know that I am young and have not seen much of the world, but it seems to me that nothing is indestructible. The Ministers react to the young man's arrogance.Father, how did you find me?He will help me destroy Leviathan. Spyros does a double-take, then swallows: \"Yeah, okay, sure.\"We have thirty days to find its weakness.We'll leave tonight.(uncertain, glancesWhy do we bring the Earth Goddess into this danger?Amoun, it seems an odd coincidence you came into my life as tutor, so long ago, and now, once again you instruct me.I'm afraid I've dragged you into real danger, Father, when I have little idea of what I'm doing.What's our attitude about destroying Leviathan?Joppa is pummelled by the Dark Goddess.By what name may mortals call you?Who do your worshippers pray to?Perhaps that is why they are falling in number?I have to call you something...That's a pretty name. Wait, better yet -- 'Vidalia'? How's that... 'Vidalia'? That's more than pretty, beautiful really, just as you are. She is pleased, self-conscious, concentrating on the road ahead.You don't like it? What's that? I missed it --Now is when an honorable man would turn around and walk away...Vidalia...I'm not the leader, Draco, Amoun is. I'm too young to start avoiding trouble. Perseus jumps up and approaches a roan Pegasus, speaking soothingly. It WHINNIES and threshes its wings, buffeting Perseus with gusts. The Pegasus rears up, and leaps over Perseus' head. It lands behind him, bucks its hind legs, and kicks Perseus face-first into the dirt. Icos and Boreas are laughing, but when Draco gives them a dark look, Boreas jumps up, sobered, and heads into the clearing.I didn't beckon the Humbaba.The monster killed my friend. I could not contain my rage. But you, Goddess, are aloof from the emotions of Men. Vidalia's eyes narrow, enraged.Master Amoun... You knew about me, didn't you? When you came to our village?You chose a poor student. I have learned little and my mistakes cost dearly.I'm no demigod, Tutor. I'm not even much of a human.I do not believe my fate is to be half a God. No demigod could feel as confused as I do tonight.Tell me of the Cleon Desert Legion.Djinn Raiders?I won't do anything rash.

Mongke and Tamburlane BLAST the swarm with HANDGONNES. Spyros lobotomizes one with his harpoon. Amoun opens a leather sack of sand.Only humans... He looks over the Lotophagi and sees Vidalia out there, alone, flinging sling-bullets as she fights her way toward the barrier.Drop the barrier! rDrop it, Amoun! At that moment, Kalibos grabs Vidalia and drags her to the top of an outcrop. At the top, he turns, LOOKS DIRECTLY AT PERSEUS and HOWLS, his message clear: \"If you want to save her, come and get her.\" He hungrily rips her leather bandeau. Perseus turns to Amoun.Take the barrier down or I'll go through it!I've learned one thing for certain! Perseus shouts at Thad, the massive Praetorian.Get down! Perseus backs away three steps. To the others --Get ready to defend yourselves! Perseus runs, plants a foot on Thad's back and leaps out through the swarm, which immediately dissipates around the humans. They have only a moment to react as the stunned Lotophagi come to their senses.Vidalia... we need to help them... He blacks out. Vidalia cranes to look over the edge of the cliff where Kalibos fell. She is mystified by whatWhere... Where are we? TheBut I thought the Djinn...Me? I don't understand.I thought they didn't speak.Tell me of them.You made only one eye?Spyros, he means me no harm. The Shaikh lowers his hand: Spyros falls into the dirt. The Shaikh pulls his veil over his face. He kneels before Perseus, head bowed.I hear you and I understand you. But I don't know how.You are praying to me? There must be a mistake. The Shaikh proffers the gleaming bronze sickle which has a zig-zag, LIGHTNING BOLT PATTERN engraved on the blade, honoring Zeus.An offering'? I thank you and take it humbly, as agift from a friend, not an offering. He takes the weapon and bows his head, surprising the Shaikh.You honor my father? You honor Spyros?Tell us what we want to know or your Eye has seen its last.Since you cannot see, let me tell you what's about to happen. I'm about to throw this evil Eye to the rocks far below. I fear its journey will be a taxing one. The members of the Expedition are impressed; Vidalia, too: the young demigod shows growing leadership. The Strix are panicked --You don't have to tell us the secret. But you will have to live as blind as she made you.Tell me first. If I like the answer, you get your Eye.I believe them. Here's your second sight. Verdandi launches and catches it in her beak, pops it in her socket.And Medusa! Where does she abide?How can she be slain?Tell of the Gorgoneion.I wish it, but I can't perceive the world that way.Nothing I have done has convinced me of that.I'm beginning to hear the wind. (senses something,Wait... She is already climbing the ladder. She stops for only aWhat?What do you see?From me?Then where? Spyros smiles, puts his huge, calloused hand on Perseus' shoulder.When does it go away?I'm going into the Temple.Of what?Yes. You?(from across theWhere?-- Joppa.Tiamat chooses the city of Zeus to take hostage. (as Amoun confirmsFather, we've seen much on this journey we cannot hold in our hands. Yet these things are real enough. At each turn, we find monsters and Gods.As you always said, they're petty, vengeful... and dangerous.No. Men must be accountable to themselves. Otherwise we serve poor masters.We must keep moving. Time is running out.Vidalia! Perseus slides from his horse and follows her. Mongke says something to Tamburlane; they LAUGH. Amoun toWho were they?I was mad with fear. I was no hero. I just didn't want to die. Perseus turns toward the altar.What is this? A marble tablet sits on the altar, its surface defaced. Vidalia runs her fingers along the scoring.How long do you have?What will happen?What about me?I don't believe that. Will love not buy another day, Vidalia?When you vanish, I'll find you.I'd rather look at you.Don't give away your secrets. You still have need of them.Where is she?It is not yours to permit, Master... with respect. Vidalia comes down into the shrine, her apron full of berries.I won't marry Andromeda.I want no reward.I am half God... and now is the time... Perseus rises. He cocks his arm and clobbers Set with an ear-splitting CRACK OF THUNDER and a sparking BURST OF WHITE ENERGY. Set drops Vidalia and lurches back, aghast. BLACK BLOOD shoots from his mouth. Perseus, his face contorted in rage, chokes Set. The God's body SPASMS and deforms in DEATH THROES.We must go quickly now. He pulls the sickle from the marble with a BRINNG! The light flashes off Zeus' LIGHTNING BOLT PATTERN on the blade.The combat has just begun.You'll have to tell them yourself. Vidalia's voice has become weaker.I will not fail them. He turns toward the Goddess, but Vidalia is gone.Vidalia? (realizing,I must get to the cliffs!May we all have a good ride today! He spurs Pegasus. it beats its wings, launching from the ridge with astounding power.Hello. (as she smiles,Are you ready to become a queen?Then you're ready to go home. Perseus raises one arm. The-AIR reverberates to a LOUD BEATING OF WINGS. Andromeda looks up in wonder. Pegasus appears out of the sun's glare, gracefully alighting on the water. Perseus helps Andromeda up and then climbs on behind her. Pegasus takes off. TILT UP WITH them until they are lost from sight.Perseus views the scene from a nearby hill. Behind him, Pegasus waits patiently, grazing the grass. Until --Yes.Yes.I have no people. You have stranded me between realms, neither man nor God.No. I thank you... Father. Zeus, mighty God, reacts to the word. His expression softens and he looks on Perseus with growing pride.You have freed me. I will not be a pawn for Men or Gods.You've made me understand that my responsibility is to myself. So it is with us all.It matters not. Whatever the source, I are only grateful. He looks off toward the funeral pyres and the human throng.This war will end the moment you choose for it to end... and Men agree. I think, perhaps, that is the free will that all realms share. Zeus looks at him, proud, yet wistful -- what an offspring, what a creation!I'm going to find Vidalia.", "clean_line": "fault gone fault fate gods history let friend die arms couldn purpose failed

think you can manhandle a Princess this way? As though she was hungry and needy as you, a mere servant? Another steamy kiss. In between liplocks, she whispersvery mistaken... a woman of my station... never be attracted... They go at it again.The Princess is not here.I don't care!To please you, I would submit to such a marriage... except I would rather die; Please let me know you're serious about this perverse plan so I can make arrangements to kill myself.Will you please give me someWhat did you say?Do you think just anyone can make intimate judgements on the royal family?Do you always start a seduction with an insult? Perseus moves to the rail, very close to her, and looks at the sea.What brings you here?I mean here, tonight. He looks over at her a long moment.It's not personal. You're not a bad-looking boy. I'm too young. I don't want to be married.Then why are you doing it?Since we agree, it's settled. No marriage.That doesn't mean we can't be friends. Get to know each other. I want to show you something. She leads him into a tall, hedged garden maze.I'll take care of you. They take two more jogs and find themselves in an odd sylvan chamber. Soft plants have been stacked in what could be mistaken for a bed.This is my special place. No one can see or hear or even find us now.Do you want to? When he turns back to her, she melts into his arms and gives him a long deep kiss. He's surprised, but handles it well. When she tries to continue, he slows things down, holding her at bay.Do you not find me attractive?Of course, you haven't been much in the world.Don't you want to make love to your almost-wife? Maybe we'll find we're not compatible.Is it true you're a demigod?I don't see it. But let's find out for sure... She kisses him yet again, pulling him toward the bed of foliage. He can no longer resist. Together they fall into the softness. He kisses her passionately as their bodies begin to move together. She breaks the kiss for only a moment, her voice husky --I think I'm becoming a believer... They start to make love.You're late.I want to thank you for seeing me home. I was so flushed with wine I can't recall much of the evening. Perseus half smiles and turns to the crowd.At what point do you plan to tell them we're not getting married?Them...My father was ready to sacrifice me to the monster.I saw it. I heard the words. My loving father, his beloved child. Only Perseus stayed his decision.The city is besieged, the people suffer.Because of me, because he did not offer me up. Is that right?Sleep? Sleep will come soon enough for me, faithful one. In one month... at the latest. The palace shakes with the ROLLING THUNDER.I would speak with the King in private.We can speak here, in the elements our subjects endure. The King's men exchange looks, then bow discreetly away, leaving father and daughter alone. Andromeda looks down at the tent city.You've sheltered me too long from the hard things in this world.And I thank you for the gift of my cosseted youth. But now, with Mother so... It's time I shared this burden you've carried so long. Filled with emotion, he puts an arm around her.No, no longer. Your protection of me has brought hardship to our people...and to me, perhaps, new understanding. I must ask you something, Father. She turns away from his gaze and looks down at the city.If you could end this siege with just one unselfish act, would you do it?Such an act is within my power. He studies her a moment, then becomes alarmed.Perseus and the others were willing to give everything.Be at peace, Father, I will not cause you any more sadness than I already have.Peshet, stop! I know what I am meant to do.I was afraid, Peshet. Afraid to understand that the fate of so many could rest with me.I'm not afraid anymore. I will do what I must. I will die so that they may live.We must get to my mother and father. A VOICE from the darkness:I think I am. He smiles.

Vidalia spins her shepherd's sling to pitch lead sling- bullets. Spyros leaps between Perseus and the monster and thrusts his weapon -- a VICIOUS-LOOKING HARPOON/BOATA delusion is planted in its mind. It thinks it's starving and it wants to feed on --I can't reverse the powerful curse. But if the monster's hungry, I can feed it. Vidalia raises her arms and shuts her eyes. A cyclone of CAWING RAVENS descends from the sky and dives straight into the monster's mouth. As the Humbaba tries to shake them away, Mongke is thrown clear.I should cast a spell upon you and leave you forever a stone upon this stream.You did, with your childish recklessness, and Boreas has paid the price! Perseus, already rife with guilt, is stung by the truth.Your safety is entrusted to me by the mightiest power on Olympos.But without a thought, you risk life and limb, your own and your fellows'.Yes, a tyrannical Goddess, who dares question your mad rush to annihilation.The Alkali Lotus... She stops, spotting something in the distance. Kosmo pulls up.What is that?This time you must do something rash. We all must. Kalibos leans close to Perseus.To save me, you risked everything -- your mission, your friends... the fate of multitudes. Men need better judgment in the one who is meant to lead them... No longer able to lecture, she regards him with love.You shouldn't have risked your life for me. It is a waste to save me when I'll be gone so soon. She strokes his hair and kisses his forehead.Thank you for your reckless disregard. Thank you, Perseus... Vidalia holds her palm above the floor and mutters a quick incantation. A small shoot APPEARS and SPROUTS FAT PODS. Vidalia squeezes the salve from a pod and covers Perseus' wound. The wound bulges, then squirms deeper into Perseus. Perseus shoots up, clutching his chest. Vidalia gently lays him down. Perseus gags. A VIPER WRIGGLES from his throat and slithers away with the fat lump of infection in its stomach.The poison is gone now.In the Djinn caravan. They're escorting us to the Skolothian border.She's got a tail and she'll use it just like that. Perseus opens his eyes.Keep your eyes shut! Open them with Medusa and it will be your last look.Good! Pleased, he doesn't sense her right cross, which knocks him down.Do you think the Gorgon will hit once and then surrender her head? He gets up, eyes closed, and resumes the defensive position, turning as she moves around him.Listen... you will hear her muscles coil. Feel her hunger in your gut. Ask, how will she feed it?You can. You're the son of a God.You do not see yourself clearly yet. In time, your actions in crisis will sharpen your view. Her faith touches him deeply. She resumes the lesson:You can do those things, Perseus, and much more. He shadows her movements more closely, back and forth.We think a room is silent until someone points out the wind. Then the wind is all we hear. She strikes. He dodges and locks her neck. Pleased, she flips him.You've learned enough for now.I know this place... Suddenly, she hurries to the trunk of an ancient tree. She probes the foliage, steps forward... and descends into the ground, out of sight.This is my church. Where I was born to the world. Where my people prayed to me.When I saw you come out with Medusa's head, I saw that a Man had done an impossible thing. Beautiful, yes, but not fragile. Resilient. Fearless.When the war began, Men ranged through the hills, stamping out any trace of God-worship they found. My true name was carved here. When it was obliterated, my worshippers lost faith and my last season began.Only days.I will vanish, quick as dew evaporating at dawn.No one will notice the moment because all thought of me will be gone.Nothing can save me.Close your eyes. 1Do what I tell you. I'm going to give you a spell.Let me give you this sliver of magic. I'll write it on your instinct. When the time comes, you'll know how to use it. She takes his head in her hands, pressing her forehead to his. Gently, her fingers slip into his mind. A TEAR runs down her cheek.Look what I've found for us -- She startles when she sees Amoun, dropping the berries.I'm so sorry, Perseus. A look of brutal, determined resolve grows in Perseus' face.The people are frightened. But they can triumph.. They need only one thing. Perseus turns to her, a question on his face -- \"Tell me... 11A hero. They're waiting for you, Perseus. Perseus looks back toward the city.
