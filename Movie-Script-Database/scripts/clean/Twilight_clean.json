You also called Mexico.Very romantic.I won't change my mind, mom.It's not about Forks, it's about Dad. I mean, two weeks a year, we barely know each other.I cut it since last time I saw you.Good.That's right. One bathroom.I can do itYeah... I think I remember.. Are they always like this?No way. The truck is for me?It's perfect!Maybe I can give you a ride to school.Too bad. Would've been nice to know at least one person.I'm kind of the \u0093suffer in silence\u0094 type.I -- no, I'm not news -- I'm, seriously, not at all(hurries to him,Just Bella.That's why they kicked me out.Sorry. There's always eating disorders, or Speedo padding on the swim teamWho are they?Who's he?I wasn't planning on it.Jerk.That'd be great, thank you.So... you eat here every night?I can cook.I do the cooking at home - in Phoenix. Mom's not great in the kitchen.A few people... Do you know the Cullen family?No... well, a little.... Okay.Mom, where's your cell?Dad, I'm heading out. EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - MORNING ON BELLA'S FACE as she opens the door and stops, dismay filling her. It's pouring down rain --the yard is full of puddles, some frozen. Bella shivers, wraps her coat tight.Great. WHIP PAN to the driveway as Charlie pulls in -driving her truck.Dad, I can drive myself to school.Ice doesn't help the uncoordinated.You got me new tires. No one's ever done that before.I mean... nothing.An animal?Be careful.And thank you. For the tires.Terrific.I'm... yes.You've been gone.Prophase.Like I said.Seriously? You're asking me about the weather?No. I don't like the cold. Or the wet. Or the gray. Or parkas. Or turtle necks.May I?It's complicated.My mother remarried.Phil is fine. Young for her, but nice enough.No... I -- I just..Did you get contacts?I'm fine, dad. Calm down.It's okay, Tyler.Dad, it's not his fault-But you didn't.It would have been a lot worse if Edward hadn't knocked me out of the way.It was amazing he got to me so fast. He was nowhere near me.You told her?! She's probably freaking.Can I talk to you for a moment? How did you get over to me so quickly?You were next to your car, across the lot.Yes. You were.I know what I saw.You stopped that van. You pushed it away.I wasn't planning to tell anyone.I just want to know the truth.No.Why did you even bother?... Yeah, false alarm..Prom. As in dance. I, uh - have to goNon-refundable ticket. Maybe you should ask Jessica.Hello, Edward.Really?How did you know about that?You haven't answered any of mine. You won't even say hello.And how did you stop that van?No way. Zero weirdness. You guys are great together.I know you do.Your fault, for telling her about the accident.He is.Should I know what that means?I'll go if you stop saying that.Thanks... but your mood swings are giving me whiplash.What does that even mean?So let's say, for argument's sake, that I'm not smart. Would you talk to me? Tell me the truth?Okay... how \u0091bout radioactive spiders? Kryptonite?No. I don't believe that. You're not bad. You can be a jerk, but it's like this... mask. To keep people away.Look, why don't we just - hang out. Like... come to the beach with us. It'll be fun - sand fleas, wind burn, salt water stinging your eyes..La Push.Is something wrong with that beach?You could ask him. (off Angela's flusteredGuys, this is Jacob. Are you stalking me?Definitely not.To be polite.You know them?You want to go look at tide pools?So, what did your friend mean about the Cullens not coming here?I can keep a secret..Like fur, fangs ... doggy breath?So the legend about the Cullens is..Didn't they just move here?Riiiight. So what was this treaty?Wait... what were they really?They just... ditch?It's a family thing.Port Angeles?.. Can I go with you guys?It looks great.Look, just take my bag.What -- no, how did you find --No. Bad idea.And you do?Okay, well. Thank you.I could eat.You're not eating?Like South Beach?So how \u0091bout some answers?I didn't ask for the square root of pi.How did you know where I was?Were you following me?So that's a yes?You said before... That you heard what those guys were thinking.. Can you... read minds?Why, what's wrong with me?What is it?Edward, you don't have to.EdwardI think I'm warm enough now.Your hand, it's still freezing cold.He died? How?The same kind that killed the security guard down in Mason?So it's getting closer to town.But that'sDad, I'm sorry about Waylon.That's probably not a good... it's not possible.. Off BELLA'S FACE, struggling to make sense of it all.. MATCH CUT:You're impossibly fast. And strong. Your skin is pale-white, ice-cold. Your eyes change color. And sometimes you speak like... you're from a different time.How old are you?How long have you been seventeen?I know what the Cold Ones are. What you are.... VampireNo.You won't hurt me. You're different.Where are we going?No! The sunlight will kill you.Slow down.No.I'm not afraid.No!Edward? Where are you?You're... beautiful..I don't believe that.I don't care.It doesn't matter.I trust you.I trust you, Edward. I'm here.Edward?Oh... I thought you hated me when we met.I know you can.I'm afraid.Not of that. I'm afraid... you'll disappear. That I'll lose you.Stupid lamb.How long have you been like this?Where'd he find you?Does someone have to be dying to become like you?..So Carlisle's the reason why you hunt animals, instead of people.Show off.Can they all read minds, too?Your house? With your family?But... what if they don't like me?I'm glad I amuse you.What is it?Come to visit your truck?A person did that?It's... wonderful.No... not moats. He takes her hand. She girds herself. They head inside.It's so light and open.Bon giorno?Oh, absolutelyI just assumed -- because you don't eat, you know..I would never, ever tell anyone.... Badly?And you're Jasper, right?Graduation caps?What a nightmare, repeating high school.So you're obsessed with music. But.. No bed?Ever?Depends. Alternative? Jazz? Sixties, seventies..I'd have to say... Debussy.No dancing.No tripping, no falling, no derision.You don't scare me.Don't you dare -In theory.Everyone's staring.Sorry I'm late. Biology project.Order one for yourself next time. You should cut back on the steak.Yeah, me, too.He's just a friend.We're not really going to talk about boys, are we?So spring training's going well?Actually, Forks is kind of growing on me.Maybe..Well... he is kind of a history buff.I, uh... have to go.I'll call you later, Mom.How did you get in here?You've been here before?You're a peeping Tom! Perv!Oh... I'm... oh.Wish I could say the same. I'm so embarrassed.I have a date with Edward Cullen.We're both juniors. I thought you liked the Cullens.Edward doesn't live \u0093in town.\u0094 And it's in the early stage and - whatever, he's outside right now.He wants to meet you. Officially.Be nice, okay? He's... important.No fair, reading Charlie's mind.And since when do vampires like baseball?Now I get why you need the thunder.That has to be a home run.Yer out?I said, leave me alone!Get out! It's over.I have to get out of this place. Out of Forks. I'm leaving. Now.I can't hurt him.No, Dad.I broke up with him.That's why I have to leave. I don't want this. I want to go home.She'll come home. I'll call her from the road.I want to drive. I need time to think. I'll pull into a motel in few hours. I promise.His face... I said the same words my mother used when she left him.If any of you get hurt because of meI wish he'd call.They could get hurt. It's not worth it.How do the visions work? Edward said they weren't always certain.So the course James is on now will lead him to... a ballet studio?No. I don't know. I used to take ballet lessons as a kid. The school had an arch like that.Yeah, around the corner from my house. But I haven't been there in ten years.No. Hell, no. I hated the place.Edward. Are you alright?No... we can't. When will you get here?Mom, I'm so glad you got my -Calm down, Mom. Everything is fine, okay? I'll explain every... Mom? Are you there?Leave my mother out of this.I... don't think so.Where should I meet you?8th and Palo Verde, please.Everyone makes fun of me.Mom, I suck.She's not here.Edward has nothing to do with this.No! Edward, don't..It's on fire! My hand!It's burning!Life... is harder.. An oxygen tube rests under her nose. She reaches for it, confused. A hand stops her as her surroundings come into focus. RENE (O.S.Edward? Where's -What... happened?Sounds like me.Mom, you're... texting.That's great mom.Mom, wait. I want to live in Forks. I have Dad..What do you think?Um, Mom, would you mind getting Dad? want to talk to him. Apologize.Is James - did you --I'm alive because of you.But you did.What? No! I want to be with you! don't wantYou really are trying to kill me.You're serious.At prom.Edward... why did you save me? If you'd let the venom spread, I could've been like you by now.I want you. Always.I'm dying anyway. Every minute, I get closer, olderNot the way Alice saw it. I heard her. She saw me like you.Based on what someone decides.

So you don't like him.But now you're unhappy.... no.It's just the fluorescents.I was standing right next to you.You're confused. You hit your head.And what, exactly, was that?No one will believe that.Can't you just thank me and get over it?You're not going to let it go, are you?Then I hope you enjoy disappointment.... I don't know.What's in Jacksonville?You didn't answer my question.Hello.Adrenaline rush. Very common. Google it.It helps if you actually watch where you put your feet.I know I've been rude, but it's for the best.Bella, it would be better if we weren't friends.You think I regret saving you?You don't know anything.No. Our bus is full.Edible art..I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't want to be.It means if you were smart, you'd avoid me.Probably not. I'd rather hear your theories.(levels his gaze,Which beach?It's just a little crowded.Get in.I should go back and rip their heads off.You don't know the vile, repulsive things they were thinking.Not hard to guess.Sorry I kept Bella from dinner.

To get to the other side, and 1 point 772453851.You knew that?I didn't.Don't go.I feel very protective of you.Yes, I followed you. I tried to keep my distance...until you needed help.I have no idea. I can read every mind in there, except yours.I tell you I read minds and you think there's something wrong with you?I... don't have the strength to stay away from you anymore.This is wrong.You're cold. We should go.That's my father's car. What's he --Carlisle. What happened?Waylon lived all the way down on Queets River. 75 miles south.Seventeen.... A while.Say it. Out loud. Say it.Are you afraid?You think you know me?Up the mountain. Out of the cloud bank. You need to see what really am. What I look like in the harsh light of the sun.Myth. You need to see the truth.Are you afraid?Then come with me. Someplace where no one can protect you. Where could do what I've wanted to do from the first moment I met you.Hold on.Are you afraid!This is what I am.Because you believe the lie. The camouflage. I'm the world's most dangerous predator. Everything about me invites you in - my voice, my face, even my smell. As if need any of that..As if you could outrun me. As if you could fight me off.I'm designed to kill.I've killed people.I wanted to kill you. I've never wanted a human's blood so much in my life. I'm dangerous to you.Don't.You... took me by surprise. I don't know how to... do this.Me, and my family, we're different from others of our kind. We're not nomadic, we have a permanent home. We only hunt animals. We've learned to control our thirst..I did. For making me want you so badly. I'm still not sure I can control myself.I wish I could understand this thing you see in me. You look at me with those eyes..Good.Be very still.And so the lion fell for the lamb.Sick masochistic lion.Since nineteen-eighteen. That's when Carlisle found me.In a hospital, dying of Spanish influenza. My parents had already died.Not just. Our bite contains venom. And once we taste blood, a sort of.. frenzy begins. It's almost impossible to stop.First with me, then with his wife, Esme. He found her in a hospital, as well. The others followed.... No, that's just Carlisle. He would never do... this, to someone who had another choice.Not the only reason.I don't want to be a monster.We call ourselves vegetarians, by the way... For our kind, hunting animals is like living on tofu. It keeps you strong but isn't very satisfying.It's not that impressive, really. Anyone in my family can do this.No, that's unique to me. But Alice can see the future.Her visions are very subjective. The future can change.Come to my house tomorrow.A complication.I'll pick you up tomorrow.You expected turrets, dungeons and moats?Thanks to tinted windows... It's the one place we never have to hide.I told them not to do this.She already ate.Ignore her. I do.Alice. ALICEI'll give you a tour of the house.A private joke. We matriculate a lot.True, but the younger we start out in new place, the longer we can stay there.... and this is my room.No sleep.No nightmares, no drool, no snoring.Do you have any favorites?Ooh, she knows her music. Alright, nineties. Eighteen-nineties. Classical.My favorite, too.Ever?I can always make you.You really shouldn't have said that.Trust me?Then close your eyes.Open.Not that guy over -- yeah, he just looked. Off his rakish, but reassuring smile..The window. As always.What else is there to do at night?Shh! The Chief will hear you!I just... like watching over you.There's something I'd like to try.I'm stronger than I thought.Don't be. But we have to be careful. I can never lose control with you. Ever.Chief Swan. I wanted to formally introduce myself. I'm Edward.I won't keep Bella out late tonight. We're just going to go play baseball with my family.Yes, sir, that's the plan.She'll be safe with me, sir, I promise.It's the American pastime. Plus, there's a thunderstorm coming. It's the only time we can play. You'll see why.Put your hair downI shouldn't have brought you here. I'm so sorry.James is a tracker. I saw his mind. The hunt is his obsession, and my reaction set him off --- We're a large clan of strong fighters all protecting one vulnerable human.The first place he'll go is your house. He'll track your scent there.Bella, don't do this. Just think about it, pleaseI'll be in the truck.He'll forgive you. Slide over..It was the only way he'd let you go.Your father's safe now, Bella. The tracker is following usIt's alright. It's just Emmett. Alice is in the car behind us.But not impossible. We'll tear him upI'll run Bella south, while you lead the tracker awayCan you keep your thoughts to yourself?Esme, Rosalie, put these on so the tracker will pick up Bella's scent.We won't, there are five of us, two of them. When it's done, I'll come get you.You're my life now.I'm coming to get you. (hates having to sayBella, we're in too deep. We can't change how we feel..In a couple hours. Then you and will go somewhere. Together. The others will keep hunting.I'm strong enough to kill you.Venom -No!It doesn't have to be that way.What's the other choice? You saidI -- won't be able to stopIt's alright, Bella. I'll make it go away.We took care of him. And the woman, Victoria, she ran off.You're in here because of me.The worst of it... was thinking couldn't stop -Bella, you should go to Jacksonville. Where I can't hurt you anymore..Prom is an important rite of passage. I don't want you to miss anything.Shall we?See? You're dancing.I won't end your life for you.That's how it's supposed to happen.Her visions change, Bella.Is that what you dream about?
