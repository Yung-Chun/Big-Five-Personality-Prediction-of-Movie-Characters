It's just up there.You don't have to ride, just climb up. She steps up onto the wooden platform, smiles back at him.Not if I can help it. He follows her up onto the ride. She weaves through the wooden animals. Starting to enjoy this secret adventure.Keep going, keep going -- She comes around the other side, catches her breath. The whole valley is spread out before her -- a glorious scatter of diamonds on velvet.Uh-oh.Ever hear of a carnival wedding? Roxanne shakes her head. Blaze is fiddling with a crisp, new dollar bill, folding it, making something.If a man and a woman walk around a carousel going backwards, they're considered hitched.Swear to God. He finishes folding the bill. The \"one\" is now neatly set on top of an ORIGAMI WEDDING BAND like a paper jewel.You want this?How'd I ever find you?I don't believe in fate.I know.

How do I make him lift the curse?What? What'd he say?Why don't you just go to the police?Your daughter -- why does Starke want her? Nomi takes a beat, looks away.

There's no reasoning with it. It doesn't have a conscience. It doesn't even have a personality.

The goons relent. Blaze and Nomi exit, leaving Rodenburg slumped on the floor, cradling his mangled hand.I think they're gone. Off Nomi's look, Blaze points at tire tracks in the dirt.Dual tracks.

He FIRES his gun again and again, but the bullets just punch through Blaze, creating more flaming holes-I'm sorry. soul, the fire expanding, engulfing Doyle.You asked for my help. I warned you what you were getting into. More a statement than an excuse. There are POLICE SIRENS on the wind. Blaze starts walking towards the pickup.S'okay -- just need to rest now --I don't even know if it's that's an option anymore. Every time I get close, I feel myself being dragged back -- --it's like being born all over again. Like every law in the universe is being broken. Blaze sits forward, gritting his teeth against the pain.See, the Ghost Rider -- it's drawn to darkness like a bloodhound. If it thinks you've sinned, it'll find you.Nobody's innocent. Think about it. Everyone's done somethincr. You. Me -- Blaze lifts up the coyote coin, flipping it over his fingers.Every night I spin this fucking coin -- and it always lands the same side up. I keep thinking -- ona time, one time I'm going to spin it and I'll see the other face. Sleep through the night without getting blood on my hands. But it never happens.I'm just so fucking tired -- Nomi moves to his side, struggles to help him up.What are you doing?What time is it?What time, exactly?They're just a kind of record. Let's go.Roxanne? Yeah, she's alive. She just doesn't know it. Coma. Probably never wake up.That's what he does, doesn't he? She nods. That's what he does.It's funny. That kid was supposed to be my second chance. Rox and I used to talk about it -- how things'd be different after she was born. Nomi didn't expect his honest vulnerability.What, kids?Make him pay, somehow --She's alive.No. We'll wait.Look, they're not going anywhere.If I what? Burn them alive? Eat their spirits?You still get it, do you? The Ghost Rider whales on whoever's got it coming, but it's Johnny Blaze that gets to remember their faces. And I Lb remember them. Every last one. Just then, we hear the RUMBLE of approaching MOTORCYCLES. Lots of them. Blaze turns, SEES a line of BIKERS chugging up the service road on ratted-out Harleys.I'll find her. You stay here. Nomi moves to protest, but Blaze silences her.If things go South and the Ghost Rider takes over, I can't guarantee he won't --You're welcome. Blaze leaves. Nomi starts in on the other bikes.Shit.Give me your gun! Nomi passes it back. The Gargoyles OPEN FIRE. Bullets zing and whine. Blaze shoves Gunt's cycle off the pickup bed The heavy wreck CRASHES and bounces, wasting the first Gargoyle. The others swerve around the sliding debrisbeing surrounded by Troopers, wrestled to the ground.I have to talk to the warden. You have to put me someplace else --Please, just listen to me. Put me in solitary, anywhere but here.You don't understand, people will die -- WHACK! A baton blow to the knee. Blaze CRIES OUT, staggers --Do not put me in here! Do not leave me with these men! They'll die if you do this!! ! The deputies force Blaze inside, using batons, boots. A stun gun SPARKS. Blaze falls. The cell door SLAMS. The inmates opposite are LAUGHING, waving, bashing their bars with every metal implement they've got as we --How--?I don't know.Yeah, I think there's something. Maybe not angels playing harps and stuff, butI don't have anything left to give, kid. Blaze stands, starts walking. Rain follows.I'm not.You can't.I don't believe in fate.It's not a church. It's a mission. They take people in. Blaze pays the driver. The truck roars away. Rain looks back to the mission, doubtful.Our car broke down a few miles back and my daughter and I were wondering if we could crash here for the night. Tolbein sizes them up -- doesn't like what he sees.What about a ride, then? Is there a town somewhere you could take us to? Other men have gathered behind Tolbein -- VISCOTT, WILSON. One of them, NUNEZ, nods to the South.That's not really an option.Look, you must have a cot, something. The kid's hungry --This is Rain.Those men outside --I know my way around a flywheel housing.Sure.What do you mean?No.She's dead.No. Rhymer studies Blaze, decides he believes him.Listen, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I've never really been a come to Jesus kind of guy.I can't stay. I'm sorry.I don't have any money.Guess so. After a long beat:She's all yours, Starke -- -- and lights it without a match, somehow conjuring the flame from within himself. He takes a long drag. In the pits of his eyes, something glows there -- a kind of lambent darkness.-- but you'll have to go through me if you want her. Starke stares into Blaze's eyes. Doesn't like what he SEES.That's not a life. And least now one I'm interested in living.Guess I'm willing to take my chances. Starke nods, accepting defeat. For now.

I know things.This thing that's riding you, the Ghost Rider. I guess it has a lot of names. But the one I grew up hearing was nagi ocanl sice. It means the Spirit of Vengeance.You kidding? I'm pure-bred Dakota. I can hear the mountains talking to each other. And I saw you light up those pricks like Chinese New Year last night. They reach the trailer. Nomi fixes glaze with a stare.He understands. He just refuses to speak it. Laforte continues to ramble intermittently. Blaze shifts, impatient, finally sits forward.The man you're looking for goes by lots of names. Coyote, Black Dog. In Dakota, he's Waka Sica. The Trickster. Look at him straight on, you might see a human. Look at him out of the corner of your eye at one of the in-between times -- dusk or dawn, you might see something else.Because it's his nature. Laforte elaborates. Nomi continues to translate.But Eagle, he had a clear eye. And he saw Coyote for what he really was. So he swooped down, scattered those pieces to the winds. The first men, they found the pieces, and not knowing what they were, they ate them. And that's, how all men came to have a little piece of Coyote in their hearts. Now Coyote, he'll promise anything to get those pieces back. There it is. Blaze exhales. He studies Laforte, those ancient, wise eyes.My grandfather says you've been looking in the wrong place. You need to look inward. The Ghost Rider is Starke's weapon. An extension of his rage. But it can't ride people unless it has something to latch onto in the first place. You understand? Blaze nods. He thinks he does. Laforte hands the coin back, returns his attention to the game. But as Blaze starts to rise, Laforte says one final thing:He wants to know if you're a bad man. If the Ghost Rider turned its penance stare on you, would you burn?I did. But I'm red. They said they'll \"look into it\". Truth is, I've had a few run-ins with them myself.Because he's her father. And he wants her back. Billy-Ray and the others, they're being paid to take her to him. Blaze nods. Things are falling into place now.You're looking for Starke. I'm looking for my kid. We find one, we'll find the other.I don't like this. I spent the last six years trying to forget this place.Billy-Ray dealt blackjack, poker. Worked the casino circuit. We met in Vegas. Things kind of went downhill after that.Believe me, Vince, this is the last place I want to be. But we need to find Billy- Ray. He took Rain.But you must've talked to him. Do you know where he's headed? Just tell me that.Never thought I'd be back here. They pass cautiously through the front yard. Nomi's pickup is parked nearby. The front door bangs back and forth. Nomi pulls a revolver from her waist-band.Listen, those things Vince said --Some of them are true.You can see the past?I was dying. I'd shot myself full of Billy's best gear. Figured I'd teach him a lesson and go out in style. Blaze nods, but he doesn't see Nomi now. He SEES --He smiled and said -- As Starke starts to speak, we hear:And I took it. What else was I going to do? I don't know what happened after that. I'm not sure I ever want to -- All I know is, nine months later, Rain was born.Billy-Ray hated her from the moment she was born. He knew she wasn't his, knew she was different -- If I didn't leave he would've killed us both.Been running ever since. In my heart, I guess I knew Starke would be coming for her one day.Sick irony, I guess. Billy certainly knew all my haunts -- This was a mistake, Blaze. We're not going to find anything here. Blaze glances down -- a HEAT HAZE has engulfed his hand. He clenches his fist, looks up --What're you --?He told you everything he knew. She's ten yards away, shaking. Not going to come any closer.Told you everything --I don't -- I don't know what else to do for you --I thought you were dead.What if you're innocent?Here, why don't you lie down for a little while? Blaze nods, too tired to argue. Nomi half carries him to the bed, lowers him down. Blaze settles back, exhausted. Nomi watches him, holding vigil. His eyes grow heavy. He shuts them a moment, opens them again --I'm sorry, I just --You must've loved her a lot. Blaze doesn't answer. Just takes the photos and wedding band from her, shoves them back in his pack. He pulls out one of the postcards, scribbles an address on it.A little after three.3:27. Why? Blaze ignores her, jots down the time. Licks a stamp and puts it on the postcard. Leaves it on the dresser.What is it with you and those postcards, anyway?You made a deal. Blaze nods.So what happened? Did she live?So he tricked you.What about the baby? Blaze just shakes his head.Maybe that's why we have themCan I ask you something? Honestly? What're you going to do when you find Starke?I'm sure you'll figure something out.How do you know ---? But Blaze isn't listening. His gaze is now fixated on the distant lights of the rock quarry.You think she's in there? Blaze nods.Then let's go -- Nomi starts forward, but Blaze pulls her back.You wait. I'm heading in.You don't know that. This is probably the best chance we'll get. They're sitting ducks. We can do this if you --They know we're coming, don't they? Blaze nods. Once again, Fate is royally fucking him.I'm going in. You with me or not?I know. I'm on my own. , Just bring her back to me. That's all I care about.Are you crazy?! Sit down! Then Nomi glances in the rearview mirror. Oh. My. God.Do something!!!Hold on to something! She brakes. The pickup fishtails. Carrigan also brakes, struggling to keep the Mack under control. Then the Mack catches a rim, flips, rolls --Honey, I don't know if we'll ever be safe. Rain nods, knew the answer instinctively. Something about her look -- far too fatalistic for a child her age.Who?You won't.Yes, I do, baby -- Nomi hugs her, desperate, as if the world were ending.

Came back to be with her dying grandpappy.Don't worry. She's got the kid with her. Carrigan watches Nomi and Rain climb into the pickup. The pickup chokes to life, carves out of the lot. Carrigan nodsI remember the deal. Just make sure you bring the money. He hangs up, follows his men to a couple of trucks waiting nearby -- a dusty Tundra for Albright, Chudacoff, Odell and Lloyd; an old Bronco for Landsdale, Fusco and Carrigan. Carrigan pulls a Glock from his waistband, chambers a round.Who wants to be a millionaire? Landsdale smiles back, an awful smile.Well, if it isn't Little Miss Running Bear. He grabs her by her hair, shoves the Glock beneath her chin.Gentlemen, you are looking at one of the finest pieces of ass I have ever had the good fortune of defiling.Now I might just take you up on that, Nome.

Sooner I get her out of my sight, the better.She's not gonna eat, Odell. Just shut up and get some sleep.Just put it out of your head.Look out there, what do you see?That's right. Miles and miles of nothing. And there's a lot of weird shit running around in that nothing. How many people you know seen a UFO, huh? Ten? Twenty? Hell, it's on every goddamn paper at the supermarket. You believe that shit, the whole country's being overrun by those bug-eyed motherfuckers.My point is; everybody's seen somethina. Ghosts, aliens, Bigfoot, whatever --Look, I don't know what that thing was. All I know is, Starke's paying us a butt- load of money to deliver the kid to him. We were told we'd see things and we were told to look the other way. You want to cut out? I'll pull over right here.Yeah? Based on his facial expressions, the news isn't good. He sighs, disconnects the call. Landsdale cocks an eyebrow.Rodenburg's dead. Oswalt, Weingrod, all those other inbred losers too. Looks like my ex-bitch has hooked up with the fire guy -- In the rear-view mirror, Odell's eyes grow wide.We're going to need reinforcements, some kind of escort to the meet.Make the call.Hey, kiddo, you're worrying my boy here. So shut your goddamn mouth --You better believe that, sweetheart. I'm just the dumb-ass that financed your whole fucking life. You and your mother both. And what did I get for that selfless act of stupidity? She burned down the house and gave me something to remember her by. He's referring to the scar under his eye. Rain turns away. Huddles against the door.Fuck. Ma. Carrigan fumes, glances at Rain -- then he just snaps, starts angrily kicking at the door. After a few futile moments, he stops, paces, looks to Landsdale.We're going to need a place where we can hole up `til tomorrow. Wait for those boys of yours.Where the fuck are those men of yours?An escort. We're making a delivery first thing tomorrow morning.Yeah, I'd say a certain amount of hijinx are likely to ensue.One.One man.Absolutely not. Lemme clarify things --See, this guy's not really a \"guy\". He's more like a demon or something.That's right.Like his head's on fire and shit. Arlo LAUGHS, the Pulsifers follow suit. Then Arlo turns to Landsdale, icy now.How `bout sixty and I'll throw in a kilo of coke?E a sy, gentlemen.

The coyote is still there, but it pays no attention to them.Yeah. Petrowsky slides the agreement to Starke, takes out a pen:Here you go. Just your standard rental agreement. You get up to 150 miles a day for free, twenty cents a mile after that. If you want additional personal accident insurance it's five dollars a day, another nine-ninety-nine if you want the loss/damage waiver. Your basic rental rate, plus applicable state and local tax. You just need to initial here, here, and here -- -- and give me your John Hancock on the line right here. Petrowsky offers Starke a pen. He doesn't take it. Instead, he pulls out a pair of bifocals. With agonizing slowness, Starke begins to peruse the rental agreement.Is there a o oblem --?I did? Starke turns the agreement around for Petrowsky to see.Geez, I'm sorry, you're absolutely right. That's the Caddy rate. Guess I entered it in by mistake -- Starke looks up at Petrowsky over the rim of his bifocals, the timbre of his voice taking on a decidedly frigid turn.No, no, not at all --Look, can't we just go with the contract we've got here?
