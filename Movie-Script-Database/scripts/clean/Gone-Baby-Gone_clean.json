Standing around posing for the camera like they have a purpose. That's why cops hate us.Cause they know we do the same thing as them without five years of jungle gym Police academy.Who's this?I heard about that on the news . . .Excuse the mess. We just finished another case. . .This is my associate, Angela Gennaro.Right. I remember that.What Angie is trying to say is: we usually get hired to find people who like, take off to New Hampshire without payin' for their jet ski-- Bea looks up at Patrick, confused.Hear her out, Ange.It's not that we don't want the job.Yes.

You just called me...This is Angie Gennaro.Jesus.Sounds promising.That's not what I meantI think you misunderstood my tone, sergeant detective. They gauge one another.I'm sure you've interviewed Ray Likanski.Ray Likanski. Skinny Ray?Well, with all due respect, we might be able to contribute on that point--The night Amanda went missing Ray was doing coke at the Fillmore Lounge for two hours between eight and ten.With Helene McCready. Poole and Bressant are genuinely surprised by this.I'll just grab a copy.. . As they stand, getting their things, Angie turns to Remy.What kind of name is Bressant?I thought you were from here.I'll have to mull that over. He takes the photos.I know you don't pay your rent doin' peoplers taxes.Just this one, Corwin Earle, is a molester. He might be staying with the other two baseheads. Just if you hear somethin' .We got hired to help find that little girl.With Skinny Ray.I thought you were down with them.Ray works for Cheese?He ain't my homey.But you and Ray kept the money?Helene, you went to St. Mark's?I was freshman when you were a senior. You were with Scott Flaherty?Seemed like he was already a faggot in high school.How did the money end up with Ray in Chelsea? I thought you went home after.Cheese never contacted you? They never left a note?The cops never asked you about Cheese before?What if Ray already spent the money?He didn' t have it.He couldn't tell them where it was 'cause he didn't know. Helene hid it.Guess they didn't believe him.It's okay . . .Did Cheese know you were on the ride with Ray?Okay . . . Where's the money, Helene? Poole and Bressant emerge from the house.Where?When we were ten. He hardly spoke English. His brother Jude was a sweet kid.And the name stuck.What about Ray?We' 11 get you some food.I donft know.I t ' s okay, w e ' l l f i n d h e r .1/11 t r y . I w i l l .I promise.Go i n s i d e .To talk to Cheese.That's a mistake. He'll never talk to a badge. I know him. If there's a deal to be brokered we're the ones who can do it.If you two go in, negotiate a ransom for a girl, then it is kidnapping and that's the FBI.Do you want to get the kid back or not?Sit fuckin' tight. We know him, he111 talk to us and we'll be right back.How you been, Chris?Good to hear it.We found what you were lookin' for in Chelsea.Cause I know one of the idiots who robbed you lives there.The one you just killed.Cheese, look at me. No one gives a fuck what you did. I never even liked Ray. You get the money. The girl goes home to her mother we'll say we found her in the bushes or whatever.No. Don' t do this, bro. This isn' t the time for that. This is where you take the offer. It's either this real quiet or it's ten thousand fuckin' cops kickin' the door down and arresting everybody.Yo, yo, what is this?If you point a gun at her again I'm gonna pull your fuckin' card, okay?'Cause your shitty pool-hall crime syndicate headquarters will be raided, your doped up bitches will get sent back to Laos and this dumb mutherfuckerYeah, that's it.He wants you off his fuckin' lawn.You know what the other half are?Cops. But don't hold it against me.No?Makes you want to have kids.There's a political party in Holland that openly advocates pedophelia and won seats in parliament. In America four hundred thousand kids get abused every year. There are half a million convicted, registered sex offenders, two-thirds of them for molesting children under fourteen, there are a hundred thousand child porn web sites. They busted one in texas had seventy thousand members-- people who gave their credit cards . . . There's a group, the 'Rene Guyon' society, whose motto is 'sex before eight or it's too late.' There's a rise in the victimization of 'pre-verbal' children, for the obvious reason that they can't report their accusers. One in five American girls is sexually abused or victimized before they turn eighteen. But only one third of those every tells anyone in their lifetime that they were abused. She gives him a look: 'oh, really?'It tells me there aren't enough gas chambers.I' d love to have a kid.I'm just not sure a kid would love to be here.I don't want to be the guy who fucked this up.What are you doing here?Caller: Bitch you better have my money.Detective Bressant: Who is this? Caller: You know who the fuck this is, fool - If you want that girl back you need to meet me up Quincy tonight. Fuck around for a minute and I throw that girl in the lake.I'll accept responsibility for--Chris Mullen was in the apartment when we made the offer.Well, it was probably him that killed Ray for Cheese. If I had to guess.I know he's a six foot, thirty year old, caucasian heroin addict. And I know it was him, not Cheese, who rolled up Pokey Jackson and shot him in the head.Dark, big, make sure he can get away.All he wants is the money. He just doesn't want to get arrested doing it.(listing the names of theFrom the kids who died tryin' to jump off em..We will. Bressant cranes his neck. A nervous tick. Finally:How are they gonna get Amanda to us upWhat happened?Right there! SOMETHING IN THE WATER. A flash of something flesh-colored. The minute she sees it, Angie SAILS OUT OVER THE CLIFF ANDIs your leg alright?Cops found no one up there. Shocker. I guess as soon as they had the money, someone shot Cheese and another guy came out shootin'. They must have tossed her in.I don't know. She saw their faces. For some people that's enough.Remy said the other two kids were black. So it wasn't Chris.No, but they got divers up there now, so.. .Yeah but, the one cop told me that two years ago some guy killed his wife and dumped her in there-- the divers found the body . . .but it was so dark they lost it and then they could never find it again. There's so many crags and outcroppings and old cars and shit.Oh, hey. It's okay. I know.Don' t say that.It's okay. We creep back slowly as the news plays.It's bullshit. He was trying to save her life.Can he fight it?What did he get?What about you guys?Hey. Angie doesn't say anything.I'm sorry.Yeah it is. I wanted to do this.I'm sorry this happened to us.I don't know. It just seems a little gay to have a couch like thatDo you even know who that is?Where?Why the fuck you want to go up Everett for?

In Roxbury he tried to tell us he never heard of him, now tonight he said he been snitchin' for him for fifteen years.This motherfucker lied to us about the reason Amanda disappeared--What?Let what go?After what we been through? You want me to 'let it go?'Something has to be wrong. He lied to me. What we've been through we deserve to know the truth. She looks at him.What do you want?Me, too.I was thinking about what we talked about other night.What i f I d o n ' t ?Can I t a l k t o you?Not h e r e .A l l r i g h t .

He lied to us because he didn't want us to know he knew Ray. That' s the whole thing.The same way everyone in this neighborhood knows everyone else's business.I understand that. I'm not asking you to believe I'm right. I'm asking you to believe in me.Where are you. I need to see you.No. There is a pause. Something in Patrick's tone stops Lionel.Fifteen minutes, Lionel.How long you known Remy?That's it?How long you known Remy?They have the internet now, Lionel.No, Lionel. Everybody don't know everybody.Why you lyin' Lionel?Do you have something to hide? Why can't you tell me?When you want to get away with a crime, Lionel it ain't bullshitting your way past ten questions. It's nobody asking the first one.You came to our house . . . .fuckin' explode.'Cause he was a cop.Bullshit. You bragged about taking a hard bust the first day we met you.So you knew 'Detective Bressant.'Why did you call Remy?And?You h e a r d Helene a n d Ray t a l k i n g a b o u t t h e money.I t r s a s m a l l p l a c e , t h e y were l o u d , you h e a r d them a r g u i n g .You a n d him t o o k Amanda, t o b l a c k m a i l your s i s t e r .F o r t h e money L i o n e l , t h e f u c k i n ' money.And you were fucked--Coke d e a l i n ' H a i t i a n would be a n e a s y t a r g e t f o r a frame--You t o o k y o u r n i e c e and l a i d i t o f f on a b l a c k guy.Go.Then what? Lionel pours another shot down his throat, gathers himself.Amanda McCready was taken by Remy Bressant !Put the fuckin' gun down! Put it down.Fuck you. You let this little girl die. You want to tell me how to live?'Do your best.' Fuck you, this is my best.You know? You let a girl go off a cliff. What do you know? You don't know.She was a child--Why would I expose a conspiracy I was a part of?Is corruption looked on lightly?How is getting a little girl killed looked on?It's fine, hot shit.He was probably killed by Sgt. Detective Remy Bressant or anyone else who wanted the 130K in his backpack.I trust the Police when they tell me something. And I had a fake ransom note and Amanda's blanket the cops left in my mailbox. And I heard the tape from when Cheese, or I guess it was Chris pretending to be Cheese, called the station.No. The call into the station from Cheese to Remy.No.I must have remembered it wrong. Remy read it to me.Look, I've cooperated. Unless you want me to go out there and start calling the papers to give 'em my Police corruption exclusive, I'm leaving.They kept my shoelaces.I don't want to do that tomorrow.Take a trip.You know where we are.Are you sure?He was a part of it. They don't tape calls. He handed us a transcript like it was evidence and he knew it was a forgery- -maybe he forged it himself. He knew what they were doing, he supported it and he covered it up.Had to be for something.For a guy who tried to ruin us, something' s plenty.No.Jesus.No.. .Angie, don't do this.I need you on my side.We're not sending her anywhere. That's her mother. She has a right to her child.Why? Because he has money and makes sandwiches?Helene loves her, too.She might learn from this.You can't take away someone's kid.~ l this time we wanted to bring herI need you to understand me right now. I need you to love me and say I know this is a hard decision but I stand by you. I need you to take me home and make this okay.You can't ask me to do something I can't do.Remy Bressant died last night.Hard to understand. He seemed like a good man.Men killed for.It's not your life to give. Helene is her mother. You think she's a bad mother you should have gone to social services. Short of that, it's her mother, it's where she belongs.I know I'm tired of being lied to and tired of being lectured by a gang of criminals. I'm calling the State Police in five minutes. They'll be here in ten.See you at the arraignment.Then I guess I will. I'll tell them I'm sorry and I'll live with it. And maybe that will happen, what I'm not gonna do, is have to apologize to a grown woman who says, why did you leave me? I got kidnapped, my aunt hired you to find me, and you did. You found me with a strange family but you broke your promise and you left me there. Why? Why didn't you bring me home?It don't matter how many outfits and snacks and family trips we took-- they weren't my family, they stole me and I was raised as a stranger to myself and the life I would have had. You knew about it, you knew better and you did nothing. And maybe that grown woman will forgive me but I won't forgive myself.The only thing I care about is that little girl. And I'm gonna bring her home. Doyle hears this. Has his reaction, something like a sagging, an emptiness, and a resolution.It's okay. She looks at himl almost sympathetic.Hi.Who?I'm sure he will.Howfs Bea?Yeah.Probably why she never paid my bill.How about youf Helene?

Beneath his image is written \"JACK DOYLE, CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN.\"This is why it's embarrassing to do surveillance three blocks from where we live.Go with him. I'll follow the mother.Where are you?Nguyen' s n a i l s a l o n .Yup. I ' m g e t t i n g my n a i l s d o n e . You s t i l l with t h e father?You d i d ?What's wrong with it?It's better than the old one.At a certain point the person who books half the business is entitled to her name on the door.Keep telling yourself that.I'm in the bathroom.Did you know her?This is horrible.Poor woman.I am so sorry, Mrs. McCready. I can't imagine what this time must be like for your family.I'm not sure we're who you're looking for.Every Police officer in Boston is looking for your niece. This is something they're qualified for.I'm not sure how much help we can be.How is Helene holding up?If a missing child isn't found in seventy two hours they are almost never recovered.I read that on the computer in two minutes while you were getting dressed.We aren't needed, we canrt make a difference and we can't take their money.I don't want to find a child in a dumpster.We have a good life, Patrick.You go out in the rain, you get wet.We're sorry to take up your time.Maybe we should go.What's Amanda like?You mind if we look in her room?Maybe she ran away.Good to meet you, CaptainI take it you didn't want us hired.We want that too, sir.We'll have a couple of tonics.Helene brought Amanda in here?Really?Ray Li kanski?Why don't you mind your business?Shut the fuck up.Don't be stupid, Lenny.Move.Patrick, letfs go. They move to the door.I'm fine. How's your hand.Thanks for that. He smiles.Helene was in there getting high--while her kid was at home for two hours. What kind of mother does that?A selfish one. They look out over the kids running past.Have you ever known me to bow out on anything before?Why? Because of those men? You think they were gonna rape me? She smiles at him.They' re not what I'm afraid of, Patrick.Is something wrong?Life's full of surprises.Is this who you think has Amanda?Isn't it usually someone who knows the victim?Why would she lie about that?Turns out the mother was down the Fillmore all night when her kid was taken.You ever sell to Helene?You didn't think it was worth it, for your daughter's sake, to tell people what happened?So, you bring in the FBI at this point?Why is that?It ' s kidnapping.He moved here when I did. There was a lot of tension between black American kids and Haitians-and he got it the worst.He had no running water at home. This one girl was on him real hard 'cause he smelled bad, calling him 'cheese.' All of a sudden, he breaks a bottle, holds her down, and carves the word Cheese in her face. She lost an eye. Someone found it on the sidewalk the next day.But I'm sure Amanda will be fine.All you're gonna do is scare him and the more scared he is the worse it is for her.Cheese, I appreciate you're seeing us. I know you're busy so we' 11 be quick.He said he didn't know anything but if we had his money we could leave it in the mailbox.Look, the Police taking over isn't necessarily a bad thing.They see more child exploitation in a week than we could in a career...Does it make you not want to?And that tells you you don't want children.Yeah?Yeah?What ?Really?Great.What does that mean?Or when he wants you brought up the back way.Captain, we were concerned for the safetyI just wonder.. .Are we rationalizing this? I mean, wouldn't a hundred police up there be better for her than the four of us? Doyle stops.I'm asking if keeping this quiet is better for Amanda, or is it better for us?Why is he bringing us all the way up here?No. Something's wrong.They're gonna kill her. I can feel it. He looks out the window.Is this where all the peak rocks have names?You be careful.Where did she fall!?Where is she?!It will be. You hear anything?Why?But you and me could recognize Chris.Have they found her?Then she could be alive. She could be hiding. She could be stuck . . .I'm sorry. . . I'm sorry. .I'm sorry.. .It's not your fault.I did, too.It' s okay.Hey. . . She puts her hand up to his face, the side of his head.Are you okay? He looks out through the glass.I h e a r d . How i s h e ?You found t h e boy?I know.Of c o u r s e I am.Why?Are you s u r e ?Okay. I'll be at home.love. Hi,Howr s Remy?Ray Li kanski?Patrick.--Patrick.Let it go.I don't care about Remy. I don't care if he's crooked. We don't need any more of this. It's enough.Yes.Why? Why is it important? Amanda's dead- fuck the rest of them. Crooked, liars, I don' t care.I want this never to have happened.Babe, Nick died.And how is it possible that he could know the money was stolen before anyone else.This is reckless. It's one thing to get obsessed yourself because that's what you need to go through-- but this man lost, basically, his child. If you do this, you better fuckin' be right.Why didn't you mention that?You h a t e y o u r s i s t e r .L i o n e l , t e l l me what h a p p e n e d .She was your sister's kid, Lionel.What happened?We'll go down to Zayre's tomorrow and get you some new ones.What do you want to do?You want to tell me where our trip has taken us?Yes.Why? For a third of a hundred and thirty grand? What for?When you're talking about ruining an old man who lost his child and gave years of service . . . \"something\" isn't enough.This is the kind of thing where if you do it, you want to be sure.No.She's alive.She's happy.She' s happy here.If you call the Police they'll send her back.I am on your side but I can't send her back.He's better for her.No.No. People don't change.Helene is arsenic. She'll kill her. She'll burn the life out of her.I don't want to. I want to leave their child with them.Because I know right and wrong when I see it.I can do that. I can take you home and I know how to make it okay.It will be okay because every now and again we'll talk about her and where she might be and what grade she's in and we'll be proud of her and that will be okay.You can't ask me to live with it,Patrick, for me.

Went AWOL around the time Amanda disappeared.He was gonna find him a kid he could keep in the house and have sex with.Not for Amanda it doesn't.--Who the fuck is this guy? You're here because Jack Doyle had us extend you a courtesy. You got something to contribute, be my guest. Otherwise go back to your Harry Potter book.Never heard of him.Fascinating.The kind they give you in Louisiana.Depends on how you look at it.

You know where I'm going with this?Did you know I used to work DCU?Right. So, I still know some of those guys real well. Anyway, I heard that someone ripped Cheese off on a New Hampshire run. You didn't hear that, did you? Angle on Patrick and Angie.Care to take a polygraph?Different questions this time.You want Amanda back or not? Silence in the room.Do you give a fuck about your kid? Another beat.rising, scary) How much? She takes a pull on her beer. Looks around. Fuck it.Howrd you do it. She exhales a long thread of smoke.Hey. Right here.

It was a cartoon Helene knows.That's the worst thing we could do.'Cause I don't want Cheese to open a bag full of newspaper and kill Amanda.I don't see a note. You see a note?We're investigating a missing children's case. Has nothing to do with kidnapping. He turns to Patrick and Angie.Fastest way Amanda gets home is we go to him, swap the money for her and walk away.Just keep your mouth shut, okay? We can get her back. It'll be fine. I have no fear of this idiot.That's the next step, yeah.You know what percentage of murders were solved last year in Boston? Twenty nine. Less in Chelsea.Where do you think you're going?Get back in your car.No. Me and Nick are handling this. This is too important.I'm gonna take that as a rhetorical question.Is that what he told you?Half the guys he grew up with are degenerates.What?Nah. You know what I hold against you? We had one chance to make this deal. You said you knew him, you said you could do it and you fucked it up. Now we have to get a warrant for a tap, start surveillance and hope to Christ we get lucky. If that costs Amanda her life, I won't have to hold it against you. You'll hold it against yourself for a good, long time.Guess you did something right.Cheese came around. Called in and said he wants to make a drop. Said he left something in your mailbox.Well, you're gonna have to check the mailbox yourself, but yeah.It is and it isn't. They tape calls coming into the station now.It means Jack heard about it, he wants you down here and he's fuckin' pissed.You don't have to be party to it, sir . . .They want to separate us. He points to diverging paths on the map.The note instructs you two to wait here on the south side for Amanda and Nick and I to be at the clearing by the edge with the money.I think we're all set here, Captain.Keep the lights off for now.Call us on the radio when you have her.Fuck it. And with that, he and Poole turn and head into the darkness.First thing I saw was something went in.We got one, the other took off.

You take a side. You beat a child, you molest a child, you hurt a child -- you ain't on my side. And hope you don't run into me because I will lay you the fuck down. Easy.Look, was he better off without the father? Yes. But okay, the kid might be out there, pumpin7 with a gun in his waistband. It's a war. Are we winning? No. Look, I got a great wife, money saved, hit my 30 in three months, pick up that pension and hail a fucking cab. Go down--Better than a good day anywhere else.
