{"GI-Joe-The-Rise-of-Cobra": {"DUKE": {"raw_line": "The hell's wrong with you, Stalworth, you didn't eat that Chicken A La King at chow did ya?What about it? Another day, another run.You're off the mission.That's what you want, right? Stalworth doesn't argue. Duke hands him back the photo.If your head's with them, you're no good to me. Stalworth nods. Duke steps closer, now one mean s.o.b.One thing, though: you step off this one, you're out of Special Forces. Gonna find you a nice desk and chair back at the base. You're be run of the mill. Regular.Then you should. Stalworth nods, grabs his kit, and leaves. Duke's hard eyes watch him go, then a slight smile creases his lips ...All right, listen up, the Cougars will be front and back, Grizzly in the middle carrying the package. Minimum distance at all times. Choppers will cover us overhead. The Lab Workers step up.--We have our orders. Okay, people! We're on the clock, let's move.Mother Goose, this is Bird Dog. We have the package and are on the dot to make Ganci Air Base ar 0900.Not me, I joined up for the jargon.Rip, if you ran the Army we'd stay up all night, fill our canteen with tequila, and call each other \"Bro\".Yeah, we'd be badasses. Eyes on the road, Rip.Keep your eyes on the road, Rip.Don't listen to 'em. you got plenty of thoughts up there. Keep rear security tight, boys.Please don't say the Air Forces.I thought we were done with that discussion.I don't think your daddy's crop duster counts as hours logged.Yeah, yeah, look, you want to get up in the air, we'll get you a trampoline back at the base.This continues to be the stupidest idea you've ever come up with, nd that's saying something.I don't wanna transfer to the Air Force, okay?I want to be in the fight, not flying over it.--Eyes on the road, Rip.Back up! Back up! Back up! Mother Goose, this is Bird Dog. We are under attack. Repeat --we are under attack!Out! Everyone get out of the vehicles! Now!You okay?Shut up.You're not gonna die.Jesus, Rip.Stay here.I'm gettin' that package. Duke leaps up and hauls-ass down the ditch, then crouch-runs up the embankment. --And comes face to face with a Viper, who raises his pulse rifle, about to blow Duke away. A hand clamps down over the barrel. The Viper looks at Ana beside him. Duke also looks at her, a flash of shocking recognition ripples across his face.What the hell...? Her face softens hesitantly.Air Force.. .right.Ana! She whirls around, drawing the weapons case over her chest and face, using it as a shield. Duke hesitates, because of the warheads or Ana? Heavy Duty goes to shoot at her.Stand down! Stand the hell down!Pointing weapons at me doesn't make you my friend. ABEL \"BREAKER\" SHAZ jumps out of the Howler wearing a computerized SURVEILLANCE SUIT, a French/Tunisian ACCENT:I don't know who you are, and I sure as hell don't know who they are, and until I find out, I'm not lowering anything or handling anything over. CLICK-CLACK. They turn to see Ripcord shouldering a rifle..you first.Those aren't the words that come to mind just now. We weren't told about any support for this mission, so you better tell your team to stand down. Ripcord eyes his sight.General hawk. Afghanistan, NATO Forward Command... Breaker sees his chance and gingerly steps up to Duke and starts sweeping a scanner across the case. Hawk smiles.No way. I signed for 'em. My mission, my package. I carry them, I deliver them. Breaker's scanner BEEPS. He keys a button. The BEEPING promptly stops. He throws a look at Duke.Fine. But you seem to be a little short on transportation a the moment. Team Alpha will deliver you to me.And where exactly are you, General?What kind of outfit is this? Not regular Army based on the accents. I have you as an Aussie... And you're a Johannesburger... And you: French North Africa. Algiers?But somehow you're all in the same unit. One you can't tell me the name of right?--You're gonna go after them aren't you? The ones that hit my convoy.General.I was never asked to join any Op group.Vaguely.This doesn't look like any Tac Op I've ever seen. Where are we?I've never seen combat gear this sleek, what's the trick?So who hit us out there?My team did everything we could out there. A lot of good men went down--That mission was classified, sir. Clearly, somebody sold us out..what happened to her? For once, Ripcord doesn't know what to say. Cover Girl walks in and hands a document to Hawk, who looks through it.When you move it, she's gonna come after you, you know that, right? And with her Intel, and her toys... she'll find you.You're going to go after her first. And I want to help.You scouted me four years ago, now I'm ready. Let's have at it.I know her.You said knowing is half the battle. Well, I know who she is. Duke reaches into his pocket, pulls out a photo and shows Hawk. INSERT PHOTO: Ana, four years earlier, much softer looking, staring lovingly at Duke as they're about to kiss.Her name is Ana Lewis, and I can tell you everything you need to know about her until... four years ago. After that, well, obviously sa lot's changed. Hawk just stares in disbelief.If I had to.I can. I signed on to deliver those warheads, General, and despite your present authority, I want to finish the job. Hawk regards him for a moment.Okay, I'll start right here: I hope that vault is tight, because she always gets what she wants...I've been wanting to do this before we deploy.Only time I'm buying one of these, so why not? They stare a each other, a touching beat. Then Duke screws up his face, worried?Well, what do you say? She's too emotional to speak. And then they hear:Thanks for killing the mood, Rex.We go at oh-five hundred.Ana, we can't--Speaking of classified information, you still haven't answered.I promise. She smiles and holds out her hand. He threads the ring onto her trembling finger. Rex smiles, but in his eyes is a glint of instability. Ripcord comes CRASHING OUT through shuttered doors and sprawls out next to them, arms and legs akimbo.Jesus, Rip. Ripcord rolls over and yells back through the doors:I'm done proposing.What's the record?C'mon, Rip. Ripcord tries harder, genuinely doing his best. But Scarlett us too fast. Ducking and weaving around Ripcord, as nimble as a cat. Five more shots miss her. And now Ripcord's feeling the pressure. He waits for her to move. Fires. She leaps up onto a corner wall and the bolt passes underneath. He fires again as she lands, ducks under it and rolls up to him. He fires his last bolt point blank. She catches it in her left hand by the stem as it leaves the chamber. Slamming her body up against his. Right hand behind his head, left hand holding the bolt. Their faces close. Lips closer. Ripcord's eyes on hers as he whispers:Again. They go at each other, fast and furious, the electrified pugil sticks crackling and sparking. Duke spins and attempts a stroke similar to Snake-Eyes' earlier move. Snake-Eyes blocks it, drops, and sweeps Duke's feet, taking him down hard before finishing him with another SPARKING HIT. Again, the Joes react. Snake-Eyes turns away. Duke shakes it off and pops to his feet once more.Again.You like her, I get it already.Really firing on all cylinders there, Rip.The warheads. They all rush out of the doors. Breaker stops to change a chess piece on the board before racing out.They can't be far.Put the case down, Ana, Rip trains his gun on Storm Shadow.Stop, Ana. Stop right there. But she doesn't. She just keeps slowly moving toward him.I will if I have to.Don't force this, Ana.Don't make me do this god-damnit!Move and I'll blow her away. Get the briefcase. Ana takes another step forward, daring Duke to pull the trigger. Ripcord, gun drawn and fixed on Storm Shadow, moves slowly forward to retrieve the briefcase. Ana is now an inch from the extended barrel. Ana and Duke are close enough to feel each other's breath. Their eyes lock.Graveyard dead.Like what?Mind control?Their weaponry, financing, intel, it has to be McCullen. Doing an inside job on his own warheads.And who says you're not a thinker. All of the sudden, Breaker rushes up to them, out of breath.Yeah, you found her all right.Who is he?That's where she's going.Per the briefing, we fast rope in, form up and assault the main lab... Rex--uh, .the science officer, stays back with Fireteam Alpha until Bravo enters and secures the building. Alpha holds the perimeter while science officer secures the WMDs. Five minutes before extraction and the airstrike. The squad nods. Duke looks to Rex again. Rex is sweating, trying not to show it. Duke hands him a piece of gum.Double Bubble? Rex takes it. Duke blows a bubble, smiles at Rex.Always helps me. You good?Go, Bravo. Bravo, a TWO-MAN fire team hit the door of the building. They disappear inside. Rex, a kit bag over his shoulder and a .45 Colt ACP on his hip, waits in a crouch, Duke next to him puts a hand on his shoulder. Duke scans the treeline for any treats. One of Bravo Team appears in the doorway and signals \"ALL CLEAR.\" Duke double taps Rex on the shoulder.You're good to go, Rex. You don't find it in four minutes, get out of there, because that house won't be standing in five. I already called for the air strike. Rex nods. Duke gives him a smile. Rex takes off and runs low to the door, entering the house. Duke watches him go, then looks back to the jungle and hears the WHUMP of mortars. Duke takes one more look, Rex disappears safely inside, then the mortar rounds start to hit. The ground is torn apart, dirt flying in the air, as Duke, Rip and the rest of the squad takes cover. We catch glimpses of the enemy, lots of them, in the jungle, firing. Duke and Ripcord pop up and return fire.I hate it when you level with me.No, no, no... It's too soon. ANGLE ON: The F-16s in formation streaking toward them across the sky. Duke looks back at the main building.Rex. Duke runs for the building. Tracer fire and mortar explosions all around him. Then the whistle of a bunker buster. Duke dives and BOOM! The building is flattened by the bomb. Duke is tossed through the air like a rag doll. Lands hard, barely registers the pain, staggers up, bloody and ripped, stumbles toward the smoking. Flaming rubble that was the building. The Blackhawk comes sweeping low, ready for extraction, the tracer fire and explosions intensify. Black smoke washes over Duke. Ripcord finds him in the debris.I can't.Yeah, we're working on it.What happened to you?I jumped over it.Yeah, you didn't know? INSIDE THE SCARAB: We see the Neo-Vipers are dead. Storm Shadow is incredibly beat and bloody, but Ana is just fine in her red Accelerator Suit. Storm Shadow grabs the weapons case and he and Ana leap out. Duke and Ripcord pick themselves up while Snake-Eyes crawls out of the TRASH CANS nearby. They see Storm Shadow and Ana emerge from the Scarab and hurry off towards the tower.C'mon! Snake-Eyes follows Duke and Ripcord, charging after them.Each warhead has a kill switch.Those nano-mites will level the entire city! Duke climbs up the side of the tower with his Accelerator Suit. Rip things about following, but then looks at the little girl in his arms, who smiles and hugs him. Snake-Eyes grabs him and they join the flow of people down the stairs. The NANO-MITES chasing them close behind. Below them, Scarlett, Breaker, and Heavy Duty are helping the police evacuate the Tower. INSIDE THE ELEVATOR: Ana and Storm Shadow race to the top.Why don't you?James?Ana listen--Loosen these, he'll never taser anything again. She taps the bonds on his wrists.Let me get this straight. You're with McCullen. You're married to that Baron. And you claim you're still in love with me.Maybe you just don't know who you are anymore.No, this isn't you, I still see the person I loved behind your eyes. Her eyes soften for a moment.She was smart, and funny. She was loyal as hell. She loved those she was close with, me, her brother... I did my best. With Rex. I'm sorry. He was my responsibility. I should have... It's why I left, Ana. Why I couldn't be with you. You were in so much pain... I thought the sight of me just give you more. She seems to be affected by this ever so slightly, then... a hard, cold look comes to her eyes, she shakes her head.No, it matters very much. We have the chance to make things right.I'm already happy. McCullen glances at Ana, watching the display with conflicted eyes. McCullen heads for the door, beckoning the Neo-Vipers to make Duke follow him.What're you gonna do with the warheads?Then you won't mind telling me.Millions of people are gonna die if you launch those warheads. What is it you want, McCullen?Who are you?Rex... Rex immediately has trouble breathing and returns the mask over his face.You sonuvabitch... Ana buried you.Why? .Why didn't you come in...?Does Ana know about this, about you?You sick bastard... you did this to your own sister?Why work for McCullen?That's bullshit. You could have had any job you wanted.Everything she's done, everything she's become, started because she thought you died that day.Ana! Duke looks over to see the Doctor holding his PDA, McCullen and two Neo-Vipers beside him, their rifles on Duke and Ana. Duke gazes at Ana, desperately feeling for her pulse.Put it down.Put it down! The Doctor doesn't move. McCullen watches the stand-off his right hand discreetly drawing STEEL HOSE out from his sleeve.Stay back!I said stay back!All I know is that neither of you deserves her. McCullen suddenly lifts the STEEL HOSE in his right hand-- --A BURST OF FLAME tears out at Duke who reflexively fires the PULSE PISTOL at it. The intense air blast from the pulse pistol catches the flames midway between them and blows them back onto McCullen. McCullen SCREAMS as his face is literally burned off. The Doctor freaks and drops the PDA, then yanks McCullen out into the corridor. Duke fires after them, then grabs the PDA, removing Ana's screen with a sigh of relief.There's nothing you can do?I'll visit you.You'll be here for the rest of your life, Ana. She looks at him, her face softening.I'm here.I'll visit you. And for a moment, she appears to crack... but then a sinister smile creases her mouth.What do you say, Rip? Ripcord looks at Scarlett, who throws him a wink and a smile.", "clean_line": "hell wrong stalworth eat chicken la king chow ya day run mission want right stalworth argue duke hands photo head good

If you want, I could--You know, I hate all the Mother Goose, bird Dog crap, I just wish they'd let us say, \"Hey, Pete, it's Bill, see ya in a few.\"Just saying, you know, if I ran things...But we'd be badasses, right Bro?Hey Duke, ya know how they always tell you to empty your head of distracting thoughts on these runs?And you know how people sometimes joke that it must be easy fr me to keep my mind empty?Well, the second I try and make myself not have thoughts, I always have 'em. Like now, know what I'm thinking about?The Air Forces.You were done with it, not me. Look, I loev flying... Duke \"mouths\" the following sentence as Ropcord says it:I've been flying since I was thirteen years old. Ripcord shoots him a look. Duke just smiles.Jets, man, jets. You know I always qualify when I'm on leave.We've done ten years in the Army, I just think we should see if the grass really is greener.Funny. Real funny.It's always about you, isn't it? Give me one good reason?Won't be saying that when you call in an air strike and I come screaming in to save your--Hey, on the training run weren't there herders around here? This puts Duke instantly on the alert.Jesus Christ! Bird Down!Who the hell is that? Duke grabs Ripcord and starts dragging him out.Duke?If I die...I just want you to know... you never could run worth a damn.I'm just saying, it's be nice if you could move a little faster. And that's when the Cougar blows, a concussive blast. Ana turns with the weapons case in time to see Duke and Rip go ass-over-teacups down into a ditch. She touches the stem of her glasses which ZOOM IN on Duke. DOWN IN THE DITCH: Duke rolls over and looks at Rip.Sure.What's your unit?Happy to turn this into a turkey shoot. Someone OFF-PROJECTOR hands Hawk a file, he looks at it.Told ya.Hey, you're cute.What's your name, darlin'?We are tough ... . but also sensitive. Whoa, that's some mucho primo stuff you gave me. Rip is high now, his eyes float up to Heavy Duty who stares back at him. Rip reaches out to touch his well-cropped hair..and a kung-fu grip.Are you kidding me? Duke wasn't born, he was Government-Issued!Duke, Duke, don't you get it: they're super secret, they're Mission Impossible. This tape's gonna self-destruct in five--I want in too. That way we can spend some bunker time together. A SWORD suddenly slices across Rip's face, an inch away. It's Snake-Eyes, checking his blade, seemingly innocent. But the message is not lost on Ripcord. Scarlett looks at Duke.We've been together forever. But not like that. Hi, I'm Ripcord.Okay, look, I didn't \"steal\" that Blackhawk, I was borrowing it... Duke shoots him a look. Hawk steps right up to Duke.Four years? My man had some issues. Duke shoots him another look, then turns back to Hawk.Oh man, I want one of those.Both. Scarlett's eyes roll. They descend into the DESERT COMBAT level, where soldiers train with desert warfare equipment.Who could possibly fund all this?That's the reason we got our asses kicked. Duke betrays nothing. Hawk looks at him.What's the other half? McCullen now appears next to Ripcord and walks through him.Jesus! And we realize McCullen is here courtesy of a HOLO-PROJECTOR. A ring of cameras provides him with images of the Joes.Hey, that's-- Duke cuts him off with a look. Breaker extracts a full 3D FRONT-VIEW of Ana's face from the photo. Then on an adjacent monitor, he runs an endless series of PHOTOS OF WOMEN.You okay?Let us in on this, General. Our team just got wasted. I think a little payback is in order.My hot tub only holds four.How was I supposed know she was married!? Nice rock! Hey, are you proposing?Not official until you answer my question. Do you love my boy?Now I've gotta find someone to love me, as many times as possible for the next three hours. WE PUSH IN ON THE PHOTO, then SMASH CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT.What's it accelerate?I just missed everything you said. How do I look? Pretty cool, huh?Don't tell me, Snake-Eyes?You can do this whole course with that thing in forty-five seconds?When I want something, I don't just shoot at it... When I get a target in my sights, I take it down. His meaning is clear. She holds his gaze, slaps a magazine into her CROSSBOW PISTOL and hands it to him.I wouldn't want to show you up.What can I tell you? I guess I'm just a considerate, humble guy. You'll learn that about me.I don't want to hurt you.What? You say something? Breaker sits at a chessboard. Heavy D sits across from him.Heavy told me she graduated college at twelve. No response from Duke, who is trying to get comfortable.She's like a freaky genius. A deadly, freaky genius.You haven't kissed anyone? Now Scarlett looks really furious. Rip instantly wishes he could take his words back. Duke just shakes his head.Hell with it. He strides across the room toward Scarlett. Breaker notices.Beach reading, huh? She groans and lowers the book only slightly.Hi, I guess we kinda got off on the wrong foot... Without changing expression she goes back to her book.Okay look, I'm attracted to you. And you, you're attracted to me. And him-- The Zen Master, he creeps me out, but what I'm saying is--Thank you.Okay, what are you saying?Okay, I'll get back to you on that. And he walks away scratching his head. Hawk steps in. Everyone comes to attention.And you get out of that...thing. Stalemate. Storm Shadow doesn't move. Ana turns and looks at Duke. Sets the case down, her voice is gentle.Don't listen to her, Duke. Was I really going to be your best man?Jesus, you okay?You're not fine, let me look at that.Take it easy, just trying to help.And what is that exactly?You know, not every guy you meet is an asshole. You do know that, don't you? Scarlett stops and returns to the sink, he ignores her, cleaning the blood off his face. She softens.Why not?You almost died. You're allowed to be concerned.Think he's be disappointed.I don't know how you teach anybody to win at everything every time.But I do know you can teach someone to get up when they get knocked down. Ripcord turn her gently in the mirror.Look at you. Still here. Maybe this is what he wanted you to learn. Scarlett stares at her reflection briefly.But of course, that would be an emotional response, one that can't be explained or quantified. Ripcord turns and heads for the door. Scarlett watches him.The weapons case! Everyone stops and looks at Ripcord like he's nuts.Remember he had us open the case for him. Remember that?I'll bet that code he gave us like re-activated the tracking beacon or something. Looks pass among the group, it starts to make sense.Wow, she traded up, huh? I mean... financially.I've gotta level with ya!Gonna be a long five minutes. Duke just grits his teeth and keeps firing. Then, in the distance, RUMBLING coming from the sonic roar of JETS.I love that sound... But then he looks to Duke, confusion on his face.Blackhawk's waiting. Come on, we've got wounded! And incoming enemy! Lots of 'em!Nothing you can do. Come on...! Gunfire bursts around them as Ripcord pulls Duke away from the ruins of the house.What about you? Don't you get a suit? Snake-Eyes just looks at him, \"Are you kidding me?\"Millions of dollars, got it. He promptly trips and crashes to the pavement. Picks himself up. Gets hit by a car. Picks himself up again.Sorry! Excusem moil Won't happen again.There's no door!Oh, man... Under the Scarab, Snake-Eyes pulls out his GLOCK PISTOL and fires into the unprotected insides of the FRONT TIRES, which promptly rip to shreds. The Neo-Viper loses control of the vehicle, SMASHES through a GUARD ARM onto train tracks. Snake-Eyes sees something, lets go, rolls free and crashes into garbage cans just as a METRO TRAIN barrels into the Scarab, which LAUNCHES into the air, hood-over-tailpipe. Duke and Ripcord are running too fast to stop. Duke manages to leap into the air, his boots barely scraping the top of the train while Ripcord covers his face with his hands and PLUNGES headlong into a window on the side of the train...I went through the train. What happened to you?You can do that?How do you say \"we're the good guys\" in French? Meanwhile, Snake-Eyes evades all the chaos by leaping up under the south base, scaling the iron lattice like a monkey.Where you going?It's too late! We gotta get off this thing!What are you doing?Can you find Duke?They're eating him!You did the best you could.You got it?We don't have time for this.The onl about i Dukendly force I careThink, think, think... At some point they gotta feed us or take us out for the interrogation. When they do I'll jump the lead Guard. Heavy, you go for his weapon and--I'm not gonna just sit here!What if it was one of you? What if they had Heavy or Scarlett, what would you do? The Joes trade looks - rock and a hard place.We're not doing Duke a damned bit of good sitting here. If it was reversed, Duke would be kicking down every door between here and the freakin' moon 'til he found me.They did away with the guillotine, right? They arrive at a door. The door is opened to reveal a man in a wheelchair, back turned. When he spins around, it's Hawk.That's it? They've got Duke!It's gonna be like trying to find whale spit in the ocean. Breaker sees a SMALL LIGHT flashing on his Ball-Eyepiece.That's my boy.Dukes' gotta be in there somewhere.No, no. Duke's our first objective.That McCullen's got some gadgets. Breaker gestures to the ice wall. Snake-Eyes uses his Katana sword to slice a circle in the wall and yank it out, revealing the DIVING BELL CABLES, but no diving bell.We find the kill switches and short out the nano-mites.I can fly anything. You just track those warheads and guide me in. We don't have long until they hit.Do me a favor? Save Duke. She gives him a nod, then leaves. Ripcord grins to himself.I see it, dead ahead.Uh, I've got a problem. The fire controls are not in here.I mean I can't see them anywhere!Fire! Shoot! Blast away! Still nothing, the missile streaking onwards towards the Earth.Teine.Teine! Teine! Teine! It's not working!How many different ways you want me to say it?Teine! And at last the PULSE LASER fires. Blasting the missile out of the sky. The CLOUD OF NANO-MITES floats aimlessly away.Just doing my job. Guide me to the other drone....man, I freakin' saved Moscow!Second drone in my sights.Taine! But nothing happens. Scarlett's voice yells in his head.Don't yell at me!Teine! The LASER PULSE fires, blasting straight at the missile which is lost in the atmospheric haze below. For a moment, he can't tell if he hit it or not.Actually, I think I'm just about close enough...Cur magh! The canopy explodes. Rip shoots back down into the atmosphere as the NANO-MITES devour the Night Raven, then float away...Good...cause I think I'm about to get arrested.I'm good. They all laugh. Rip steps up to her.So how do you feel about this?", "clean_line": "gonna explode stick chopper fly want know hate mother goose bird dog crap wish let hey pete ya saying know ran things badasses right

Heavy Duty reluctantly doesn't shoot, everyone watching Ana backpedal towards the waiting Typhoon. Duke charges like a bull and tackles her. Ana sprawls and the case tumbles free. Duke and Ana go eye-to-eye for a split second, then Duke goes after the case while the Joes take the opportunity to spray gunfire her way. Ana zigs, zags, and dives into the Typhoon, which is raked by the bullets.That's classified. Snake-Eyes discreetly grabs SHRUNKEN THROWING STARS from his belt, but a look from Scarlett makes him out them back.He's going into shock.I thought all the Special Ops guys were tough.We'd get tossed for telling.You two a team or something?Why do they call you that? Breaker laughs, reading Ripcord's file:Liquid armor. They reach the DEEP SEA COMBAT LEVEL where dozens of men and women are testing fantastic next-gen UNDERWATER VEHICLES.Whoever she is, she's clearly well- financed, with access to highly classified intel and state of the art weaponry. Their capabilities are beyond anything we've ever encountered.Breaker?Sixty-three seconds. Not Bad. But not good enough. Gotta get under a minute to qualify.Forty-five.No, me. Ripcord glances at Scarlett's CROSSBOW PISTOL.If you're going to shoot at something, kill it. Otherwise take up knitting.Here. Go on. Try it.Oh, that's so thoughtful of you.I'm the \"target in your sights,\" right? You've got ten rounds to \"take me down\".They're training arrows. The most I'll feel is a little jolt.Guess you didn't really want me that bad, rip. She holds his eyes a moment longer, then lets him go. As she walks away, Scarlett casually tosses the ARROW, it hits the ground and EXPLODES. Ripcord and Duke jump back. Ripcord glances at the underside of the pistol's magazine. Three words: \"CAUTION: LIVE BOLTS\". Both men watch Scarlett saunter back to the beginning of the course, awestruck. Breaker walks by eating a burrito and watching his bio-rhythm display.No, he doesn't. Do you? This time Snake-eyes looks up, his expression unreadable.See, he knows you have to listen to get to know someone. Right, Rip? Rip is happily stowing his liquid armor gear, glances over.You're going to teach me science? I read all about the positron emission tomography studies concerning sex pheromones when I was twelve. I'm just saying, it's not very romantic. Rip whispers to Duke, nodding towards Scarlett.Who am I shooting first? The laughter stops. Rip looks surprised.\"We're attracted to one another.\"That's what you're saying, not what I'm saying.Attraction is an emotion. Emotions are not based in science. And if you can't quantify or prove that something exists, well, in my mind... it doesn't.I believe you've got my luggage. Ana stares at Scarlett, then quick-draws a PULSE PISTOL. Her shot tears the CROSSBOW PISTOL out of Scarlett's hands. Ana's got her dead-to-rights until Scarlett triggers her CAMO- SUIT, melting into nothing right in front of Ana. Ana doesn't spot the RIPPLES OF AIR around her until she's stuck hard. The case goes flying. Another SMACK and her pistol is knocked free. Ana grabs a second pistol, but that's just as quickly twisted out of her grasp and dropped. Ana fights the invisible Scarlett as best she can, but Scarlett lands several unseen blows on her. Ripcord and Duke take out a pair of Neo-Vipers. Storm Shadow climbs back into the Arclight. Looking at ana as she falls near a vehicle on the blocks. Ana grabs an OIL PAN and flings the oil, which sprays over everything, including Scarlett, making her visible. Ana leaps on Scarlett, knocks her to the ground and angrily begins to choke the life out of her. Storm Shadow ignites the Arclight which jumps into the air, powered by an arc of blue light shooting out of its engine pack. He quickly swoops towards the two women and grabs ana by her arm, pulling her along. Ana grabs the weapons case and they soar up out of the motor pool and over the landing pad. The battle raging below them. Ripcord and Duke fire after them, but they vanish up into the next level. Heavy Duty, now back in action, takes out the last of the Neo-Vipers. Snake-Eyes checks on Scarlett who's nursing her neck.I'm fine.I looked at it, it's fine.I know what you're trying to do.I don't have time for this.It's not you, I... I didn't really want anyone to... see me in here.I don't know. All the people we lost last night. General Hawk... My neck is not that important.First fight I've lost since I was a kid. My father would be... he was my instructor.He taught me to win.We're not a couple. Snake-Eyes and me. We're... close, he's like a brother, but... we're not a couple. Ripcord looks back at her, nods, then walks on out.Nano-mites. I wrote my thesis on the theory behind them at Oxford. They've been surgically implanted behind the ear, all programmed to accomplish different tasks.Theoretically, the possibilities are endless. Increase their speed, agility, resilience. You program, they perform. That's the genius of nanotechnology, it can do pretty much whatever you want it to.I don't see why not.You may be right. Maybe he needed NATO to pay for his R D.What about it?Lab? Breaker call up an image of DeCobray standing in front of a huge PARTICLE ACCELERATOR along with some other scientists.They're gonna use him to weaponize the warheads.Heavy D and Breaker will stay in the Brawler, watch our back. The rest of us will break into the lab with the accelerator suits. Once the warheads are weaponized, they'll be extremely volatile. We can't afford to let any of them go off inside the city. Ripcord looks at Snake-Eyes.He doesn't need one.Keep going! With that, he leaps after the Scarab, just grabbing the back of the vehicle as it tears away. The Brawler stops right next to Scarlett, out of breath, her accelerator suitDon't worry about me, go and help Snake-Eyes! Duke doesn't need to be told twice. He leaps out and runs after the Scarab. Rips starts to follow, Breaker grabs him.Look at the moves they're making, they're heading somewhere. Breaker widens the map, plotting a route.Don't shoot! We're a special anti- terrorist unit! There's a bomb up there! POLICE CARS are now rushing up behind them. ON THE SECOND FLOOR: Ana and Storm Shadow speed over to the main tower ELEVATOR and barge their way inside. Storm Shadow hurls the ELEVATOR OPERATOR out as Ana opens the weapons case and removes one of the NANOTECH WARHEADS and its KILL SWITCH. Through the stunned crowd, they see Snake-Eyes reach the top of the stairs behind. Ana rolls the warhead towards him while Storm Shadow lines up on him with the Security Guard's pistol as if to shoot him. Snake-Eyes glares defiantly at Storm Shadow who just grins and lowers his gun at the warhead. A SINGLE SHOT AND THE WARHEAD EXPLODES. Snake-Eyes recoils. ON THE GROUNThe brain survives for a couple of minutes after death. We can read his most recent memories.He's not alive.They activated a self-destruct. The Neo-Viper's body starts to decay before them. Thousands of NANO-MITES literally eating away at his flesh and bones.Hurry, Breaker! But the NANO-MITES are too fast. The Neo-Viper's legs are now gone. His chest and arms next. Breaker rapidly scans through the MEMORY FLASHES. But now the NANO-MITES consume his head.And we'll do the same for him as soon as we get out of here. She has a thought and turns to Breaker.Partial? You said partial latitude and longitude.Maybe it was the whole coordinate, just 90 degrees latitude.Before the image went to snow,...it's the polar ice cap. RIP'S DOG TAGS hit the floor and slide to his feet. The Joes all look up to see several POLICE OFFICIALS looking at them.Maybe a northern one. Hawk smiles and wheels out the door.What?It's an underwater facility...Wait, what's that? Breaker ZOOMS IN on a massive TURBO-LASER CANNON.Could it take out our sub?Then that's our first objective.The main force can't attack as long as that cannon's online.Elevator cables. They've got a surface entrance. Shipwreck? She turns to the submarine commander, HECTOR \"SHIPWRECK\" DELGADO, a fiery Spanish naval combat veteran.Snake-Eyes, Breaker, Ripcord, and I will infiltrate the factory from above and destroy the cannon. Heavy D, as soon as we give the word, you lead the assault from outside.The arctic water would kill us.Then somebody has to go up there and shoot those things down.Can you even fly this thing?Ripcord? He glances at her, a moment between them. Then she presses forward and kisses him on the mouth. He stares back at her.Good luck.It's pressure plated and laser protected. Anyway around it?Give Ripcord the coordinates.It's gotta be voice-activated.You have to say the words into your flight helmet.Try \"teine\".It's Scottish for fire.Listen to my voice, \"Teine\".Ripcord? What happened? Rip!Ripcord? Talk to me...Ripcord! Still nothing. And now they begin to suspect the worst. Then:What happened? Are you okay?Yes...yes, it worked.Let's get out of here! Scarlett grabs Breaker by the scruff of the neck and hauls him out of the room.Snake! Snake-Eyes grimaces, then looks Scarlett in the eyes.I feel very... emotional.
