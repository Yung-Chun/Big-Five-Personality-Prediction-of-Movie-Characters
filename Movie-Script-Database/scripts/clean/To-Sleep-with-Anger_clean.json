He has been asleep all day.You should go back and rest.One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.I have someone I want you to meet.I will have to look for it.Harry, you know everything.No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.It would be nice.Are you feeling well?He is getting his things together.

I haven't had time to tend to my garden like I should.You are very sweet, but Gideon has already taken care of everything in case something happens to him. He has a policy.Excuse me.

The child had died and he was writing to give her some comfort. Hattie didn't know that deep down at the bottom of Harry's hate, there was some love.I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell.

I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end.

You ought to stop protecting him.You're always taking his side.I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.Instead of standing here doing nothing, I better give those chickens some scratch before they start cackling.Well, well, look who is taking up all the sunshine. Brother John, how are you doing?Tell me something. How do you get energy to stay on the move all day?Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.What did your wife get her?Boy, go tell your wife to come in.Babe Brother is a poor boy.I need about five pounds of laying mash and you better give me about the same of scratch.When are you going to have a sale on weed killer?What kind of a sale is a two-day sale? I thought sales last a week or two.All of the preachers were down in the basement of the church confessing their sins to one another. They were way down in the basement 'cause they figured no one would hear them. One of the preachers said, it makes me feel too shame to tell how bad I have been. You know them young gals that sit up in the first row. I can look at them and forget my text. I'm just lost when it comes to women, even them middle age sisters. Then another preacher said, I don't think I can tell you what my sin is 'cause it's bad. Another preacher said, Brother, we all amongst friends. Tell us what's troubling your soul. Clear your conscience.So the preacher said, we all got a bond 'cause we confessed to one another. So let me tell you, my sin is corn liquor. I just acts a fool behind that spirit water. I loves it more than preaching. Now ain't that a sin, lord. So all the preachers went on confessing, each one worst than the last. Finally they came to the last preacher who had been very quiet and listening to every word that fell. One of the preachers said to him, it's your turn. Confessing will lift you burden, Brother. Bare us your soul. We did. The last preacher said, no, my sin is the worst among all of you. One of the preachers said, ah go on man and stop all this suspense. So the last preacher said, like I told you my sin is the lowest. My sin is gossiping and I can't wait to get out and tell what I heard.I'll you a story about the terrapin and the rabbit. No, you tell me a story. Come on.I looked everywhere for my toby.Harry, good God Almighty, man! It's been, what, thirty years or more. Suzie, we haven't seen Harry since we left home.This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry.What are you doing in these parts?Why didn't you catch a plane?Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.Man, act like this is your home.You had to tread softly.Harry, I would like for you to meet my oldest son, his wife and daughter.It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the windowYou ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.Well, I would appreciate that.It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.In weather like this, you cannot walk around bare-headed.Haven't the years been good to Hattie?Good God Almighty, if it ain't like a parade of people from out of the past. M.C., where did you come from?Well, it's up to Suzie.I think we have enough. So now tell me a story.Be careful of the water.You tappy heads better not tear down my house.Tell me, how come me and Suzie have to be mother and father to your child? You never take the boy to the park, circus or anything. If we did not take him to church, he wouldn't have any sense of religion.Is that the way your parents raised you?No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.Junior spends time with his child.No, I'm too hot now.I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it. Son, you make me wish I was dead.Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.I'm worn out.I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.I will appreciate that.I don't want to stay here. Where is Babe Brother?Next time, I don't care how sick I'll be, don't take me back to the Veteran's Hospital.I tell you, I feel like a ghost.It's good to be able to hear that.How is the garden doing?How is that hen doing? I was meaning to pip her before I fell sick.I'm going to lie down. Take my, hand and help me up, lest I fall.Oh, I couldn't have last another day in that hospital. You get weary being in the old soldiers home, old soldiers and war stories. They wait to tell you their last story; the next morning the nurse pulls a sheet over their face.Suzie, I'm hungry.Suzie.Suzie.What, are you having another party?Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?Not our Harry?What happened to him?How long has he been dead?What happened to your hand?What did you put on it?I hope you will take care of your mother better than that when I'm gone.Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?How come you're not wearing my shoes?When is the undertaker coming?When are you boys going to fix that roof?Here I am thinking about myself when poor Harry is resting on the floor of the kitchen.Did I ever tell you the story about the man who wanted to make his own mind up about heaven and hell? He didn't want nobody's opinion but his own.He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, \"I thought the streets were paved with gold.\" \"They are but you won't see them,\" he said. \"Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness.\" So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. \"Man, this is a dream.\" He asked, \"What's you'll doing?\" They all hollered back, \"Sinning.\" The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, \"Please to meet you.\" He asked, \"I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire.\" Someone said, \"Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins.\" The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...I'm almost finished.

The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?Well, I don't want to put you out.Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor.Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.No, if I rest any longer, I won't sleep tonight. May I use your bathroom to wash up a bit?That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say \"go on in there brick and hit somebody\" and it would find its mark.All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.Good morning.Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil. And evil is a thing you work at.Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child. In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.In some things. When we were children, there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you didn't have something on you that didn't make a X.Did you have your child at home?Some folks take that natural stuff too far.Country people got so many strange ways,That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out.I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets. I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.How often is your wife called to help delivery?Everything these days is made overseas.Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways... ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you. It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what? I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead.I can sit here and look at train tracks all day. We laid enough of them, didn't we? So many memories are stretched along tracks like these.We'll go a little farther. The walk will do us some good.I'll be right there.Girl, do you still sing and dance?It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything.You can certainly tell how old you are, my dear.Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.\"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly.\"My sister, women can get away with so much. I don't have any enemies 'cause I don't live in the past. As Pushkin, you don't know him, said, \"In the hope of glory and good, I look without fear ahead.\"Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.We can have it here next week.Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?I already have, my dear.A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.Well, you and your husband are special. Ya, Gideon tells me you do volunteer work to help feed the poor.How many people do you all feed?Good God Almighty, bless your bones. But the problem grows.Of course not. Have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people? No you ain't. You have to take just one and fatten him up. When you spread help too thin, you , you just nickel and dime the situation. If you try to save all, all die but if you save one life, life goes on. You just have to remember, medicine that works leaves a bitter taste.You just take one; you thaw out the cold and hunger in his bones from sleeping on the bare ground.Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at you. Hey, you have to think of yourself. A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. There are too many bad people out there.Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.Take your wife and child home, boy.I got a surprise for you tonight.This old buffalo has been in the sun too long.Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.You folks excuse me but you know we have a celebrity from out of the past, our own nightingale. If you had any good times in your life, you remember Hattie. She use to keep those juke joints steaming. If Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith were the stars, she was the sun. Let's get Hattie to sing something from the old days.Man, I can't talk to you now. I'm filling in the gaps with these folks.Son, you haven't danced with your wife all night.Now who are we talking about?Wasn't Hocker lynched?What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.Those boys never did have good luck.Emory had made a lot of enemies. He had a big mouth.What's the problem here?How is everybody?Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?I hope that it's nothing serious.Let me earn my keep. I'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. Try to make him some cow tea next time.You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.When I came upon the valley of bones, the serpent said, \"Make this your home. Dry as my soul be, heaven is lost to thee.\" We all got to make way.A chicken hates to see the preacher coming to dinner.Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?Son, I can take everything you got with that deck. It is marked. Now I'm going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck somewhere.Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.That smells like fresh coffee.Only if you can spare it.Son, would you get me an old piece of newspaper?Lord if you ain't an angel.I will leave you something in my will.How old is that boy?Let's give Dry Bones a call to see if he is coming or not. Okra likes to exaggerate, keep you waiting all night.Let us walk awhile. I grow weary when I sit still too long.Give me your arm lest you fall.You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.How is he doing?I made a fresh pot of coffee. Okra and I thought you need a rest. I'll stand guard. Okra wants to talk to you anyway.Good afternoon, ladies.As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?You invited me.Like that boy next door playing that his horn. If he was a friend, he would stop irritating people, but if he stops practicing, he wouldn't be perfect in what he does someday.Okra, M.C. and Herman want to go back home with me. Suzie, I'm not a bad fellow; I just like to have a good time. M.C. is coming by to pick me up tonight. I'll come back to get my things. Well, I hope Gideon recovers. You know I have an extra picture of one of my sons that I would like for you to put with those baby pictures over your dresser. It's better than being in my dusty wallet with addresses and names of people who are no longer on this earth.I'll say my so-longs to Gideon before I leave and I truly wish that he will get well.Whose old piece of knife is this?I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.We are going where the action is. Ain't that right, Okra? Let's play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up. What would you give to be rich?I know your mind is on your wife but you should never treat a woman as an equal. You want to get your wife back, get another woman, one of those big hip women that will ride you till you sweat.Double the stakes?M.C., you ever heard of a real man having one woman?When one woman puts you out, you have another to take you in. You don't drive around without a spare tire, do you? The more mules you have hitched, the easier it is to plough.Herman, let me borrow a few bucks.Bless you. Bless you.Let me share something with you.Hattie is a snake. That woman broke up so many homes and caused a lot of misery and because she calls herself getting religion everything is put right.It's important to know the difference between the incoming fire and the outgoing fire. As Amos and Andy might say, \"We is the outgoing fire.\" Come with us, son. We'll show you some steaming hot juke joints, steaming hot women.We will wait for you as long as we can.
