{"Final-Destination": {"ALEX": {"raw_line": "Whoa! Whoa! Mom, you gotta leave that on. It's like... the tag made the last flight without crashin' or anything, right? So, it should stay on, or with, the bag for good luck.I will. Don't worry.Fuh-ck, do we have to put up with that shit the whole time?Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.John Denver...He died in a plane crash.C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?Qu'est-ce se?! THE PLANE'S GONNA EXPLODE!We have to get out!We have to get off this plane!Now! NOW!!I'm not joking! I'm not joking!Listen to me! This plane will explode on take-off!Fuck you! I'll remove myself!I... I saw it... like, I don't know... the plane took off. I saw it leave the runway... I looked down and saw the ground...And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.Only trip you're gonna take is to the fuckin' hospital.I wish you were on the plane!You're lookin' at me as if I caused it. I did not cause this.How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...No. I saw it. I saw it!Not like a dream... more than that. I experienced the plane exploding... it was so horrible... I know what they all went through tonight...I'm not a pyschic... I've never had this happen before...No!Because... I... never thought it would really happen.I don't.Then maybe you should lay off the J.D.Not here, not now. Not EVER!Ms. Lewton...I don't want to sound gay, or nothin, but... I miss you.That's a plan.What happened? Is Tod alright?What... what happened?Mr. Waggner...He wouldn't do it!He... he told me we would be friends again after you got better. After you got over George. Why would he make plans for the future if he were planning on killing himself?It's only the end of June.Like, um... you're mad about something?You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.Why were you there last night?Why were you there last night?I'm... really sorry.I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.What if Tod... is just the first... of us?I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe... I would know.This place?!That... him?That's him, but... he's not here. That... whatever... that whatever made him Tod is gone.Why..?I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...What are all those tiny marks?Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.You saying Tod did kill himself?Design?Maybe there's no way to win... but... if you figured out the game... you knew where the \"steel ball was rolling\" couldn't you avoid the trap and extend the playing time? Couldn't you... cheat Death at Its own game?I'm sorry we broke in.Yeah, we did.He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.How many died on Flight 180? From our group?Remember the gate number?Thirty-nine.Remember the departure time?Do you know when I was born?Right. April 25th.My birthday is the same as of the time I was meant to die! That's a reach!?I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.Clear, how do we know that by just sitting here, breathing this air or sipping the coffee, having crossed the street... we haven't started in motion the events that will lead to our death? Fifty years from now. Ten years. Tomorrow. You don't unless... you're able to open yourself to the signs I'm willing to show you.No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.The mortician said Death has a design. Now... if you, me, Tod, Carter, Terry, Billy, Ms. Lewton messed up that design, because, for whatever reason, I was able to see Death's plan... then we cheated it. But what if it was our time, what if we were not meant to get off that plane? What if it is still is our time? If... It... is still not finished with us? We will all still die; now, not later.Unless... we find the pattern. And cheat it again.Then there's no one left who can help me.Look, there's something you should all know.Dad... you and mom have helped me out, so much. But there's... some things I need to understand before I can talk... to anyone about it.That's Tod's seat...The path of the explosion... That's Death's design.Checking the air in her tires to make sure they're safe.I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.I didn't ask for what happened to me on the plane. You can make fun of me. You can think I'm a nut. I'm used to it. I saved six lives but the entire school acts like I'm a freak. Fine.I'm not suffering from Post Traumatic Stress. I haven't developed a narcissistic deity complex. I'm not going Dahmer. This just is. There's a pattern in place for you. And you. There's a design for everyone.And I'm not sure yet how... but I intend to break this one.No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.Ms. Lewton!Ms. Lewton!Are they up there?Somehow... is 180 still in flight? Somewhere... are they still safe?Most kids do, I guess.This won't be safe.No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.Why do you think I was hiding?They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...I already told you...Yeah. When she died... at that moment, I could tell she saw something... horrible.Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list.Billy, get out!You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design.That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.My intervention in the death of 180 surviviors will cheat the design.Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!After Billy... it's me. And then you.Hey, I won't let it happen, okay.Rusted. Tetanus. Nice touch. I overlooked it. You tried to capitalize. But I caught you, you fuck. I can beat you. Not forever, but I got this cabin rigged to beat you NOW!I... never moved. Christa asked me to move, but I didn't change seats. I would've moved up... next to Tod... How could I not remember... that... I never moved. Clear's seat was in front of mine...She's next.Don't move!You're grounded in the car. Don't touch anything. DON'T MOVE.NO!You know what to do.When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over.You know what to do. I'll always be with you.NO!", "clean_line": "whoa whoa mom gotta leave like tag flight crashin right stay bag good luck worry fuh ck shit time man george michael notch gay john denver died plane crash mon man like thought gonna tittie fuck em greenland qu est ce se plane gonna explode plane joking joking listen plane explode fuck ll remove saw like know plane took saw leave runway looked saw ground cabin banged left exploded plane blew real exactly goes trip gonna fuckin hospital wish plane lookin caused cause know think sort got feeling weird feeling explain saw saw like dream experienced plane exploding horrible know went tonight pyschic ve happen thought happen maybe lay ms lewton want sound gay nothin miss plan happened tod alright happened mr waggner wouldn told friends got better got george plans future planning killing end june like um mad went ve wanted thought limits night night sorry ve dealt death wasn alive grandparents died wish know mean heads feels like tod know wish time maybe know place tod gone friend best friend father tiny marks pull wire committing suicide father pretty fucked denial maybe couldn deal thought accident taking son saying tod kill design maybe way win figured game knew steel ball rolling couldn avoid trap extend playing time couldn cheat death game sorry broke yeah said death design said seeing patterns died flight group remember gate number thirty remember departure time know born right april th birthday time meant die reach layin bunch math talking indications omens day meant die aware saved plane clear know sitting breathing air sipping coffee having crossed street haven started motion events lead death years years tomorrow able open signs willing thing message hinting design mortician said death design tod carter terry billy ms lewton messed design reason able death plan cheated time meant plane time finished die later pattern cheat left help look know dad mom helped things need understand talk tod seat path explosion death design checking air tires sure safe believe ms lewton yes pattern occuring ask happened plane fun think nut saved lives entire school acts like freak fine suffering post traumatic stress haven developed narcissistic deity complex going dahmer pattern place design sure intend break long outta control ms lewton ms lewton flight safe kids guess won safe mean won safe home lewton ll think hiding blame tod plane crash told yeah died moment tell saw horrible knowing going easier makes harder matter list billy lewton ve pattern dead saved intervened like plane design skipped carter went path explosion billy intervention death surviviors cheat design course gods aren afraid die gods die billy hey won let happen okay rusted tetanus nice touch overlooked tried capitalize caught fuck beat forever got cabin rigged beat moved christa asked change seats ve moved tod remember moved clear seat grounded car touch know ll skipped ll know ll"}, "CLEAR": {"raw_line": "The airport doesn't endorse solicitors.Thanks.He's not a witch.Because I saw and I heard Alex. And... I believed him.Here's good.Thank you for the ride.Because of you... I'm still alive. Thank you.Alex!Get outta here!Almost Autumn.Yeah, but everthing's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming. Almost like bein' able... to see the future.Know what this is?A piece of debris... from the plane. I went to the shore off the crash site and it washed up on the beach.It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.Look, I've seen enough T.V. to know the F.B.I. doesn't investigate teen suicides. But they were there last night, that means: one, they still don't have a clue what caused the crash. Two, they haven't ruled out anything. And the fact that seven people got off the plane is probably weird enough, not to mention, that one of those people had a vision, or whatever, of it exploding minutes before it did explode, is highly suspicious. And it doesn't help that the visionaries' friend just committed suicide.Know what this is?It's you.Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehansible attraction.Before that day, you were just another suburban nothing that would never have anything to do with my life. And I'm sure you thought I was some Marilyn Manson body-pierced freak, or whatever. But at that moment... on the plane... I felt what you felt. I didn't know where all those emotions were coming from until you started freaking out.I didn't see what you saw, but I felt it. Okay, I'm not into all that X-Files bullshit... but it was a psychic connection. Why to me? Why to you?And you can still feel it, can't you? Something from that day is still with you. I know, because I can still feel you.That's why I was there last night.\"It?\"Is that something you're \"feeling?\"Then, let's go see him!Gives me a rush...Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.Good call. Very \"Quincy.\"I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?They said he hung himself, but there's no marks.Why would they say it was a suicide... if it weren't?We didn't find what we were looking for.The mortician was whacked.He was trippin' on formaldehyde.As in flannels and plaids?Thirty-nine.No.Like... 4:25.Wait. I thought you meant the time of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as in, month and day... that's a reach.You're sounding like those people who, you know... \"Oswald shot Kennedy from a warehouse and hid in a theatre and Booth shot Lincoln in a theatre and hid in a warehouse.\"That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.Hey, look! \"Coffee\" starts with a \"C\" and ends with an \"E.\" So does the word \"choke!\" We're going to choke to death! Oh no! Starbuck was a whaler. We're going to be harpooned!You'll go nuts if you start with that shit.She's leaving the school. Moving away.I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?Alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. But here... you're suggesting Tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active Presence.After hearing you, just now... I do believe......that Tod killed himself.Alex...I don't know where he is. He's not talking to me.Because I didn't believe him.What are you doing?They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.They'll follow my car. That's why you're taking me.Because he knows which one of us is next.He could be anywhere from here to a mile down the shore. You guys drive down there, start this way and we'll meet around the middle. It'll take half the time.When I was a kid, like, six or seven... I used to worry so much about my parents dying. Like lying awake at night... just worrying. I loved them so much. I didn't want them to get hurt. And what would happen to me? What would life be like? Every night... it seemed.Most kids never have it happen.When I was ten... my dad went into a 7-11 for cigerettes. I guess he heard somebody say \"Don't turn around.\" So on reflex, or thinkin' a friend was jokin'... he did. And the guy blew his head off.And, let me tell ya, I had every reason to worry before... because life became shit. I don't blame her, I guess, but my mom couldn't deal with it at all. She married this asshole, who my mom with my real dad would cross the street to avoid this guy. He really didn't want a kid. And so my mom didn't either anymore, I guess. If that was the design for my father... and my family... then fuck Death, FUCK IT!And so, anyway... I've thought of that \"somewhere,\" Alex. It exists, that place.Where my dad is still safe. Where he had a full pack of cigerettes and kept driving. A place where me and my dad and my mom... are still together....and have no idea about this second life, here. A place where our friends are still in the sky... where everyone gets a second chance.But that place might only exist in my heart. And maybe, now... yours. I haven't experienced too many second chances in my life. I haven't seen any. But because of all of this, I believe... because of you... I will get a second chance. Because of me, you will. With you in my life... that place, right now existing in our hearts, will spring out... and become a real part of this life.And that is the only way we can beat Death... by making something special out of Life.Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.Nothing is... anymore.We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house. Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.Knock it off!Not with us in the fuckin' car!I know what you're doing! It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.We're afraid, too, Carter, but we're not going to quit. Maybe you are. You act like you're not, but you are!So, stop what you're doing and STOP THIS CAR! Right fucking now!Move it!Carter, get out!Scared now?Bullshit. He saved your life...again!WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!Police are coming.You're losin' it. The police will be here. We have to go to the cabin. You can hide there. Get your head together.I'm not turning him in. There's another life that needs him now.I go with you.Don't hurt him.Run!No! No! Don't!I felt him! When the baby was born... I felt Alex pass through me... like the night he died...We beat it, Alex.I believe... that's what Alex believed.
