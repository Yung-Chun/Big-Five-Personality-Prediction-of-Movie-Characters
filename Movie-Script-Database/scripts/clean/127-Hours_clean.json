{"127-Hours": {"ARON": {"raw_line": "Nearly missed it!Hey. Are you doing the east pike? Can I come along with you for a while? The girls don't reply, just look at each other.I'm on my own. I'm Aron.Nice to meet you. What a day.Did you bike or come straight from the trail head?I left mine at the Horseshoe Canyon and biked here.17 and windy.I do this a lot. They laugh. He's crazy, but harmless.Wasn't expecting to see anyone in the canyon today.Sorry.Yeah, I know, I mean there's no one around for 50 miles.Let me guess... You're here for the paintings or the Cathedral?The climb's a little tricky but it's worth it.There's thousands of holds but you can't see them until you're almost upside down and then they just keep appearing... it's a bit of a act of faith so I'll go first... take off as much as you dare as there's a bit of a surprise at the other end...I swear I won't look but I swear you won't care when you get out here...... and the thing is, when you get to the middle... He lets go.... there aren't any more. We spin and watch him fall into the most exquisite emerald pool 60 feet below.Well, there's not really anyone special.Long story.I've done 46 of the 59 winter solo ascents.Well I figure no one else is mad enough to climb in the winter.What? No.Just like a MOTEL 6 then?Solitude. Great tunes. Empty mind. He indicates the wilderness.And I can sing Phish songs as loud as I like.Yeah, I know, I know.I'll get this. Leave no trace.Hey, but I like a beer like the next man. You know, end of the day.I'm not certified yet but that's what I want to do.It's hard to get the hours to qualify. Catch 22.Great. Now put your ass on my head.You'll have to chimney down a little ways - like here, watch - one foot on each wall then squat onto your right heel, now your butt's on the wall, so you can move your right foot across, now put your left foot under your butt lower down and scootch your butt down - watch that black part, it's slick, slime, try not to get it on your shoes - if you can get to these bomber handholds here it's like an elevator shaft and just think friction to control the slide. This is a keeper so always have someone at the bottom to boost you out. He looks up to them.Why don't you come with me to the Big Drop Rappel? I can give you a lift back to your car.About another 8 miles or so, I think.No, I really got to do this. Anyway I've my miner's lamp.No, it's great for seeing snakes in hand holds. Can I get a picture then? They pose with raven feathers in their hair.Listen, my friends are having a party tomorrow night. You should come.Drive on the east road and about 40 miles out there's a huge inflatable Scooby Doo. You can't miss it. Turn off and it's about 2 miles down that track. Starts late and it'll go right thru. Lots of cheek kissing and his last picture of them...No, I really got to do this.That's the one. I'll have 3 cold beers waiting for us.Easy Aron, easy now. He keeps moving, descending still, but a little more circumspect. He lets the change of pace allow him to whip round his pack and with the practice of thousands of times selects and plays a CD without stopping, slipping the headphones over his head.Won't be coming back this way.Yep.FUCK, get your hand out of there!No, no... more water.Relax. Stop. Come on. He breathes and breathes, taking stock for the 1st time.FUCK! What the fuck? How the fuck did you get your hand trapped by a fucking boulder? Its crushed, it's fucking dying man! He reaches up and touches the trail of blood, hair and skin left on the canyon wall as the rock pushed him to where he is. Looks under boulder, no blood - check. [He hears the crowd cheering on his headphones. It's been playing throughout. He switches it off]Not good. He blows the whole lot into our face with a mighty gust.When in a hole.... Alternative; he starts digging away at the wall instead, same result.Fuck. It's hard as iron. Pause.Shit!Shit!!!Sweet.Cool. He picks it off his arm and places it on top of the rock next to where he's working. It's a grain of sand on the seashore but it's something.Aahhhhh.Caw-caw.It's three-oh-five on Sunday. This marks my twenty-four-hour mark of being stuck in Blue John Canyon above the Big Drop. My name is Aron Ralston. My parents are Donna and Larry Ralston of Englewood, Colorado. Whoever finds this, please make an attempt to get this to them. Be sure of it. I would appreciate it. He takes long blinks and seems to avoid looking at himself though the screen is facing him. He looks alarmed and wide eyed, startled, in contrast to his slow slurred delivery.So... I was hiking Blue John Canyon yesterday... and this happened. He pulls the camera round to show where his forearm and wrist disappear into the horrifyingly skinny gap between the chockstone and the wall. As he does that weWhat you're looking at there is my arm, going into the rock... and there it is, stuck. It's been without circulation for 24 hours.It's pretty well gone. If the colour doesn't come across on the video, it's grey and blue.Unnhhhhh.......I'm in deep stuff.So I have very little water. He can't help look in the camera towards those who know what that means in this place.Yeah, I have about a third of a litre left. He picks up the water bottle and shakes it for the camera.So the way I see it... there's kind of four things happening here... I tried to move it with some rigging... useless... and I tried chipping away at the rock... I think part of the problem is, is that my hand is actually supporting the rock. Which means every time I chip away the rock moves a bit and settles onto my hand again. I can't feel it happening but microscopically, it seems to be, because the little gap over there between the rock and the wall seems to be getting smaller. And this chockstone is the hardest thing here.So the third thing left was to cut my arm off.I don't know whether I could do that but it's pretty much suicide. It's four hours to my vehicle that way and with very difficult climbing with one hand and the bike is like two, two and a half hours, that way but the climbing... fourth class climbing... which I think will be probably impossible with one hand... between the blood loss and the dehydration I think I would die if I cut off my arm.Which means I'm waiting for someone to come along. He summons up the guts to let the evidence out.I didn't tell anyone where I was going and I didn't leave a note on the truck.Dumb. The video whirrs on until he suddenly looks straight into the lens.No one's coming Aron.God, I am praying to you for guidance. I'm trapped in Blue John Canyon - you probably know that - and I don't know what I am supposed to do. I've tried everything I can think of. I need some new ideas. Please show me a sign. PAUSE - Just his breath. He switches on the head lamp and the inside of the bag explodes with light. There's enough light for any kind of heaven but it's just Aron in Blue John Canyon. He looks around his bag. He stops. Silence. Only his breathing to listen to. Heart rate... fast... too fast. Light off.OK, then, God, since you're apparently busy: Devil, if you're listening, I need some help here. I'll trade you my arm, my soul, whatever you want. Just get me out of here. You want me never to climb again, I can give that up. Just show me the dotted line.Ungg-gggu-ggga-gggngh!Yeah. Not very funny.Still not sure. I'll see you Tuesday.Always do.It's freaking me out looking at myself so I hope you guys are OK with thisIt's Monday - all day - bummer. I spent the morning trying to create a 6:1 system ration and lift the boulder but friction between the rope and carabiners is dissipating every bit of force I apply.All it's good for is sitting in...There's a raven flies overhead, I clocked it at 8.15. I'll bet it's there tomorrow too. I'll film it for you tomorrowI have about one hundred and fifty millilitres of water left. That's four ounces. I can't believe it but I peed twice today, within a few minutes of each other. How is this possible? It's two days since I peed, I'm dehydrated and I had to go so quickly I forgot to save the first. I saved the second in the CamelBak. Will I drink it? It smells foul, and hot but it'll settle. And I can chill it in the sand in the night. It's like Polar winter here for nine hours.No number twos. Which will disappoint my insect friends. They're gonna have to wait. The sunlight appears down here for a few hours. I get 15 minutes of it at 9.35... and apart from chipping away uselessly at this rock that's pretty much my morning routine.I keep chipping at the rock but just to generate warmth and give me something to do. I think it's making it worse. I know it's settling more on my arm as I remove material from it. The area where I chipped flakes off yesterday has already rotated down onto my arm.Oh yeah. That aches. He takes out the multi-tool and switches to the long blade. looks at it. Then he presses the blade and draws it quickly across his forearm. Nothing. Repeats it harder. Nothing. No cut, no blood, nothing. He switches to the short knife and saws viciously at the same point.Shit! He releases the tourniquet and as the blood flow returns a series of angry red lines establish themselves where he was sawing. He looks at them.Pathetic, Aron, pathetic.The blades are too blunt even to break the skin. I guess that's the chipping. It's not even a proper Leatherman. It's a knock-off one we got free in a gift pack with a torch... Mom gave it to me.I didn't get to hear firsthand how your championships went, but I heard from Mom that you placed very well at the national competitions, that you were tenth overall in speech and debate in the nation. Hot damn, girl. I'm very proud of you. Not just for that but for who you are. He looks directly in the lens for the first time.I can imagine you in your living room looking back at me.I've been thinking about what my friend Rob in Aspen says to me several... frequently.. Several times that, confusingly, 'It's not what you do but who you are'. I kind of got hung up on that a lot, because I always thought who I was, was very much wrapped up with what I did. That I was happy because of the things that I did that made me happy. If things you do make you happy, then they can also make you unhappy. I think that's why I found myself being as ambitious and energetic - The wind interrupts him and he shivers.It's cold... this place is an ice- box at night... And killing winds.(he struggles to complete the sense of theI did want to say, on the logistical side of things, I have some American Express insurance that should cover costs of the recovery operation when that does happen. Bank account balances should take care of my credit-card debts. You'll have to sell my house, Mom and Dad. Possession- wise, I don't know if Sonja can use my computer and video camera...No. No. Don't.See you later... ... swallows quickly 2 'spoons' of urine without disturbing the sediment. Tangy and bitter, the saltiness makes him wince.Fuck a nut, Aron. Pay fucking attention - look what you did? He stares at the stain - with all the dirt on his shorts it's already paste. He screws the lid on slowly and can barely be bothered to lift his lens into his mouth.Good morning everyone! It's 6:45 Tuesday morning in BJ Canyon. The weather is great! I figure by now that Leona, my housemate - Hi Leona! - has missed me hopefully since I didn't show up last night. Another hour and a half they'll miss me for not showing up for work. Hi Brion at work! Best case scenario is they notify the police and after a 24 hour hold they file a report, a missing persons report. Which means noon tomorrow it's official that I'm gone. I do still have the tiniest bit of water left. Well, actually, I've resorted...I've had a couple pretty good gulps of urine that I saved in my Camelbak. I sorta let it distill...it tastes like hell. So it's 70 hours since I left on my bike from Horseshoe Trailhead during which time I have consumed 3 liters of water and a couple mouthfuls of piss.Mom, Dad, I really love you guys. I wanted to take this time to say the times we've spent together have been awesome. I haven't appreciated you in my own heart the way I know I could. Mom, I love you. I wish I'd returned all of your calls, ever.I really have lived this last year. I wish I had learned some lessons more astutely, more rapidly, than I did. I love you. I'll always be with you.Ready for lift-off. He bounces his full weight in the stirrups and pulls on the haul line. It looks a better set up.Come on, move, dammit.Whoa, that's the bone. He pulls the knife out opening the wound more. There's barely any blood. He pokes at the gash with the tool.Ouch!This next part may not be for all viewers at home. It's a little after eight. At precisely eight o'clock I took my last sip of clean water... and... hide your eyes, Mom... He pans across the boulder and zooms in on the wound, smattered with bright red blood.I made an attempt - a short career in surgery, as it turned out - those knives are just not anywhere close to the task. I've got about an inch-wide gash in my arm that goes about a half inch deep. I cut down through the skin and the fatty tissue, and through some of the muscle. I think I cut a tendon, but I'm not sure. I'll never saw through the bones with this knife. I tried, anyways. It really just didn't go well. The tourniquet is relaxed at this point. Which actually is a little bothersome, considering I'm not bleeding that bad, barely at all. It's so weird. You'd expect to definitely see more pulsing and bleeding, but oh well.Shit missed it. 8:31AM. He's late and I still missed it.God, it's Aron again. I still need some help. It's getting bad here. I'm out of water and food. Listen. Give me the strength not to do anything against myself. I want to see this through, whatever. A rumbling thunderous sound grows and the inside of the bag begins to bear the image of the top of the canyon at dawn but crumpled like paper, creased like the bag [BUT STRETCHED ACROSS 2 SCREENS]. The noise grows and grows...Out of date. May Day. Not dead. He smirks.No raven today. Everything's fucked. Sonja... if you still want me to play at your wedding... there's a tape in a box in the basement of Mom and Dad's Lounge. It's me 1993 or 1994. We hear the music. Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, Chopin - he can hear it as he played it until...There was a little boy,and he looked like my cousin Charlie but he was too young. And I don't want to die... But I really don't know what to do. Pause.I hate this rock. The rage blooms purple in his mind.I hate it. His face swells with anger, nostrils flaring.I hate this fucking canyon.I hate this cold slab pressing me against this damp fucking wall. Smash, Smash, Smash.I know there's water near coz of these fucking mosquitoes.I hate this fucking mess.Shit.Get rid of it Aron, it's dead, it's garbage. He drops to his haunches but the webbing stops him at his waist. He detaches it and drops down again, almost able to squat. His trapped arm is the only thing preventing that. His face is suddenly open.Ok Aron, here we go. You're in it now.Hang in there Aron. At they get closer he summons a surge of energy from somewhere.My name is Aron Ralston. I was trapped by a boulder on Saturday and I've been without food and water for 5 days. I cut my arm off this morning to get free and I've lost a lot of blood. I need medical attention.No, we need to keep hiking. We need a helicopter - who can run fastest?- You, go now fast. Take him.Who? Who told you?Do you have a phone?Do you have a cell phone?Is it ok for me to drink so much water?I gotta stop and empty my shoes. You'll have to tie my shoe lace. As he sits his head slumps forward. He's absolutely motionless. Wayne and Erik try to talk to him but he can barely hear them. A pop song spins round and round distantly.Yes I am. Can I get a lift?I'm gonna make a terrible mess of your seat.Thank you for bringing me back. The most senior of the burly men says,Will you look after this for me please?Mom.Hey Mom.OK. Are you okay...Mom, I'm sorry I scared you.So are you guys ok with me?Christine told me.Yeah.I'm gonna finish the 49ers this winter or next.Rana, before I did it I was hallucinating, I saw this child,
