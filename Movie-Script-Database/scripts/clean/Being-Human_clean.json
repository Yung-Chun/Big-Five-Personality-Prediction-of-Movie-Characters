{"Being-Human": {"HECTOR": {"raw_line": "Go back home... leave me alone...No... stay here... stay! Hector takes a few steps. The Boy follows.No... go back... go away...Leave me alone! Stay here... Stay!Up the hill!Up the hill! They're down there already. I saw them!Don't move from here. I'll come for you in the morning. There's no food. Try and sleep in the branches. Don't cry. Don't make a noise. Hector moves off, looking back to his children in the tree. They too gaze anxiously at him. They don't wave. Maybe waving hasn't been invented yet. Hector heads off alone, higher into the hills.Yes.Two mice... and some bread...Two chicken legs, then, cold, and the bread. As Hector is given the food and pays for it, he sees another man, JULIAN, approach Lucinnius, trailed by TWO SLAVES. One of them is carrying a folding chair much more substantial than Lucinnius's. Julian and Lucinnius greet one another and sit down to talk, Lucinnius at something of a height disadvantage. The Two Slaves move off to one side. Lucinnius's mood has brightened since the arrival of his friend. Their conversation seems open and friendly. Hector gives his master his food, and then moves to join the Two Slaves, hearing a snatch of the conversation as he goes.When did you hear? SLAVE #2 Last night. Nepos knew. Pirates. They're sunk, he reckons. That could finish him, eh?This is the worst it's been. * SLAVE #1 You'll be up for sale before you know it!He's finished... you reckon? The other two nod their heads. SLAVE #1 Yes... at the baths... I could tell... they smelled blood...Well... if he'd pulled it off he'd be in Rome by now... SLAVE #1 And you with him... Hector nods his head thoughtfully.And me with him... half way home...Will he lend you the money?That's a problem.Have they?Yes.It sounds good. Lucinnius misses the irony in Hector's voice and enthuses about his own future generosity.You must.He kept me working until morning.He has no money and a lot of enemies. If he's very clever he'll survive... but the omens are bad... and he's not very clever.Nobody does. He's unfortunate. You get people like that. Clumsy and sad. Thalia looks out towards the sea.It's the Gods arguing. They're working out what to do with Lucinnius... he'll be lying awake down there... wondering what they're saying about him.If he goes down I'll ask for my freedom... he owes it to me... he said as much... you too... we could be free...What we talk about.I just made that up... I don't * know which way they are... anyway * ... you can't think like that. * Not after so many years... *We talk about it because it can * never happen. What we do is you * and me...Never. It's you and me now. That's all.Then I can see you every night. I'm tired.Sorry to trouble you... just fetching a chicken... good night ... the roof's free... The Man shakes his head with a smile. Hector leaves, the sleepy chicken going to meet her fate in his arms.Come on, miss, you can tell Lucinnius his future.You look happier.Will he help you?What if you don't...I don't know what to say.I don't understand. What do you want me to do... I don't think I can help you...I don't know what you mean. What mess? *You say we... I don't know... what is we? I've done nothing... I * know nothing... Lucinnius changes his tone, becomes more, in his own mind, frank, man-to-man.What kind of story?So I'm a conspirator?Can I sit down?This is the worst it's been.But even if it's round you can still fall off the edge. Hector has picked up a large metal plate to help him make his point.Do you believe everything that Greek tells you...?So, where is my home?Seven. Gallus walks out the distance from Rome with his fingers, * as if there is serious calculation. *I wasn't upside down... and how * could you see the sun round there ... I saw the sun at home... every day... Gallus is stumped for answers. *Yes, tell me tomorrow... I'd like to know... because my children are round there and I want to know that they're getting the sun... ask him something else, too... where are the gods if the whole thing is round?It's saying yes... there's a way...But you asked it if we had to die, or if there was another way... it's saying yes, there is...Maybe it's just hungry... The chicken is inscrutable, as they are prone to be. INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT A dead chicken adorns Lucinnius's table. He and his wife, DALMIA, and their son are lying on their couches picking at the food with their fingers. Lucinnius is drinking more wine than usual. Hector and the other household slaves are in attendance. Thalia is also there, serving her mistress. Dalmia knows something is up, but she doesn't know what. She attempts to break the silence. She calls on the cook from the kitchen.Only chickens.No... but I want something...I want to die a free man... I don't want to die a slave...In writing... so that when they find me... they know I died a free man... please...Thank you.What do you want me to do?I understand.You've done it... you've done it ... lie down... Hector speaks gently, like coaxing a frightened animal. He helps Lucinnius lie out on the marble floor.Close your eyes... you did it...Lie still... lie still...Shush... I'll need the knife...I'm leaving... come now if you want to... but we must hurry... I'm a free man... I'm free. Will you come?I have some mail for Tyre... where are the east-bound ships?We want a timber ship... they go west... straight to Rome...You can go to anywhere from Rome.Where is the Captain?Good morning, Captain... I'm looking for passage to Rome, for both of us...I'm the steward of Lucinnius the merchant... we have business in Rome... I need an immediate passage...Of course.When do you leave?Keen to start, yes.Yes, of course. We can tell he is lying.No... they can't be... they're lost...A bit cold... walking... She smiles at him. He sits opposite her in the wagon, and allows his foot to touch hers. She doesn't move away. Hector calls to the Driver.How long to get there?I thought I heard fighting... back there... Beatrice replies, but in a language that Hector doesn't understand.I don't know what you're saying...I don't understand. Beside Hector the Girl has stopped sobbing but she is still troubled. She turns to him and speaks quietly but with determination.I saw some fighting today... back up the road...I don't know. They all look the same to me.How do you know she's a widow?You did, Ronald.I won't be travelling today.I'll stay.I think you know what I'm saying ... a little...How come you don't speak like anyone else? Are you far from home? Home? Where you sleep and live?I'm far from home, too... way, way * over there... then across the sea...Have you ever seen the sea? Water * everywhere... right to the end of the world... I come from the other side of the little water, then * there's the big, big water... I * had a friend who sailed on that... * went too far... fell right over * the edge... into nothing. They never came back... they fell off the world... Hector smiles, pleased with himself. Beatrice laughs.You think that's funny? It's true... it's a sad story... you shouldn't laugh.I'm not making sense, am I? Well, let's go back to homes. That's where I'm going... I've been away for too long... Some people locked me up... I had to run away.We have to learn to talk the same... try it like me, say it... home...Home... home... try it... home...I don't want your word for home, I want you to say mine... home... home...Home... home... Beatrice smiles. In this tiny victory the dynamic of their relationship is set.Flea... a flea... thanks.Why don't we go somewhere and have a good session... I could do you... I'd like to give you a good grooming... They understand each other perfectly now. They look around for a more private spot.Yes, it does feel good. She gives his scalp a final delicious rub, and then stops.Got one... a tiny little one... yours are so small... and fair... * To Hector even her fleas are a delight. He seems to want * to keep it as a pet. There is no hope for this man. * Beatrice moans softly, happily. Hector still kneading * her scalp.I don't know your name. I'm Hector... who are you? I'm Hector. Beatrice replies with a hint of breathlessness.Beatrice.Yes, I think Beatrice is a good name. * Beatrice is sighing contentedly now.Good morning. Hector and Beatrice look at each other. The Priest looks at them in turn. Their cheeky act of innocence mocks him.You're a busy man, what with all these souls departing.Nothing at all.Moving on, as you told me to... we'll meet up, like you said. I'll wait for you at the channel.Witch my arse. Stop giving me orders. Both of them are unhappy now, confusing one another, spoiling their friendship.You're a strange fellow. Are you a priest? Are you jealous?You have work to do here. The Priest walks back up to the farm. Hector calls out * what might be an attempt at an apology or simply another * taunt.I don't understand you.I'm glad we're going the same way.Why do you smell so wonderful? He lifts his head to let her see him sniffing. *He's not moving. He must've seen us, though. She sits up and straightens her clothing, suddenly anxious.It's a dead man.Come on, we're going that way at any rate. They move cautiously. When they are closer to it, and * can see it for what is is, they walk straight for the dead body.No sign of a battle... only a few horses... or just one. He wasn't killed in a fight.That's good of you.It's all we can do. It won't keep the wolves away though.You've put magic in this stuff, haven't you, you're bewitching me... They appear to get the gist of one another's love talk.I don't know what you're saying but I like you when you talk.We should go now. We've been here too long.You said mama. I know what that is... mama... We can talk the same...I have to keep the sun on my back, that's what Ronald said... the sun on my back all the way home... I'll stay on this side of the river...I stay on this side...Oh yes... oh yes.I think we're going the wrong way. I want the sun on my back. We should have stayed on the other side.Is there water... to drink... to wash? He mimes with his hands. Beatrice understands that he wants some breathing space. She talks to her son.No, no... sit down... I just came to watch... please... sit... He guides the Mother back to the good chair. They struggle comically for a while, but eventually she allows Hector to settle her there. She mumbles unhappily.You must sit there... look... you need the light from the window... it's your seat... I don't want it... it's yours... I can sit on the box. The old woman allows herself a shy smile. Whether in innocence or mischief, she has secured the best seat in the house for herself. If he stays, Hector will never dare rest his bones in it.Ah... The Boy says something and points towards his sister. She stands by her cauldron, stirring the bubbling liquid. Hector goes to watch her work. He looks in the cauldron.Good color... for cloth?Ugh...Peepee? The Girl nods enthusiastically. The Boy is sniggering.Mmmm... good food....I have to leave soon. I can't stay... it would be wrong to stay for just a while...I have to go... have to keep the sun on my back... I have to get home... I have a family, just like you... I like you... you * smell good... wonderful...I had a wonderful dream. I was * lying under a tree, beside a river. I was dozing. I heard the water... beautiful clear water. I got up and drank some. I think I ate some * raspberries too.I think there's more chance of me eating you, Andre.I have a carpet and some cloth... I thought if we worked together we could make a better shelter... Francisco barely stops his work to reply.At least ask Dona Ursula...Well... would you take my cloth, at least?Good work, Andre.You go and sleep by the big fire, Andre. Keep warm.Thank you, Nuno.I'll start with two.But there's tomorrow, Nuno... we must eat tomorrow too...Dom Paulo would call it a waste. You must keep yourself strong, Nuno, that's what he'd say... so that you can help the others... God knows what we have ahead of us... we'll need strong people like you... Nuno is silent, unconvinced.Try not to think about Lopo any more... The guards wouldn't let you near him anyway.Goodnight!I hate it when people have to die. *It's foolish squabbling at all. We should be friends. Francisco looks at him for the meaning in what he is saying. Hector shrugs. He takes a small bundle from his jacket and gives it to Francisco.Some bread and raisins.Well this wasn't. It's for her... and you. Francisco looks Hector straight in the eye, looking for his angle. But this time there is none. Hector is simply a lonely man seeking to retrieve lost friendship. There is a glimmer of sympathy in Francisco's face.I must speak to her!How are they?Yours were fine?Have you any eggs left?You were lucky. What?You don't like Andre anymore?We're not going to die, Andre... Hector smiles at his own insensitivity.I've forgotten your name...Now I remember why we called you Andre.I will, Andre... I promise... I'll call you that... when I remember... Andre is satisfied, and leaves. Hector calls to him.Good night... Keta...Yes... good night...Hey! Stop that, will you? Think of the older people, and the sick... I'll give you an egg if * you stop... here...Stop that... leave her alone... get back to the camp... or I'll tell your mother... how can you play like this when there are people needing your help back there...? The Boy is standing now and fixing his clothing. He walks off back to the camp. The Girl remains sitting in the sand, buttoning her dress, too embarrassed even to raise her head to Hector.Come back... I didn't mean it... it was a joke... you come back... she's still here... I won't say anything...I'm sorry.Suck out the marrow... it's the best bit. Nuno follows Hector's example. Hector allows him to feel the benefit of his gift before he starts to talk.I'm sorry about today...But it does... it was mean of me... I was upset at something... I wasn't really angry at you...You don't think too badly of me?You still like me? Nuno shyly nods his head.You do?Well, that makes me feel better... we all have to like each other... and respect each other... that's important too. They are silent for a moment.If you don't respect me, just say so...I have a boy like you... maybe * you could meet him when we get home... This doesn't produce much of a response. Hector tries again. He starts to chuckle to himself and nudges Nuno in the ribs.You can take her back there tomorrow, eh?I'll be glad when we're on the move... the sound of the sea is driving me mad.Where is Ursula? Sleeping?Will you share a bottle of wine with me? I've had it since we left the ship... I want to drink it tonight, with you. This offer has found a chink in Francisco's armor.Yes.I know. I feel very guilty. I brought this too...Honeyed fruit. The last I have. Francisco can't believe such food still exits. He smiles in anticipation.I brought it for Ursula... Francisco talks through his munching.Surely... some fruit couldn't...Why is it always me? Why am I always guilty, always sorry... am I so bad?I had to get home... just like you...But... the other raft was sinking... FRANCISCO * So? *You must come with us.And afterwards... what will you do then?Alone?Francisco... I have to see her * before we leave.Ursula... it's Hector.We're leaving soon. I've come to say goodbye...I won't forget you... I won't forget India... I can't forget how I hurt you...We should have talked... I could have explained... many things... She manages a whispered word.Yes... I'll pray for you in Lisbon... at the Cathedral... She lies still. Hector lingers for a moment. Then he speaks again.I'm sorry I hurt your pride...Nothing, nothing... Ursula speaks one word, and then falls back into a dead faint.Ursula?Francisco, I must talk to you alone...Yes. I think so... *Is there anything that I can do for you? A letter... a message? * Francisco laughs softly.I want to ask you something. * There's no easy way to do it...Your boots... Francisco looks down at his boots.Can I have them? You can have mine... they'll be fine for here... but I have to walk six hundred miles... Hector lifts a foot to show Francisco his boot. Francisco is stunned into silence. But then a smile comes to his * face.I'll walk all the way home, Francisco... I'll pray for your soul in the Cathedral in Lisbon...Yes.They were made by Da Fosca, weren't they? Francisco is giggling now.How long?Damn them...It's Sandy's... whiskey...It's too high for Indians?If you did find an Indian, what would he be?We keep working?You think we'll get out?I'm not fast... you're slowing down. They obviously have this tiff every morning.What's the point of having two chronometers when you don't take the average?You're unscientific, Bobby... at heart... Hector writes in the book. He speaks pointedly.Seven twenty-five...Sure this is a good idea.Hi! Hello! The Indian backs off from them, holding his hands up and smiling crazily, as if to say, \"Don't mind me, boys, I'm just leaving...\" Hector and Bobby are equally silly in their response.Hey, come back... we're just moving through... don't apologize... we all got a fright... goodbye...Did you see him?Was he a Delaware?Yeah... I think he was an Indian too... What about the horse?Don't panic, Bobby...What did you see?An Indian... with long hair...Yeah... he was't tall...Let's get a bit further up. They move off. Bobby looks at Hector's backpack.Some food, the logbooks, my letters, a candle...No.What about bears, without a fire?What? No... not tonight...Dear, Father, I miss you. Three frogs are dead. Everybody misses you. Bring me a bear's head and claws and a gun. School is good. Miss White has married a fireman. Come back soon. Do not worry about the frogs, they did not have names. Nathaniel.It's not so funny now as it was.If you knew him... if you could picture him saying it... it would be funnier.I'm going home, for the winter...No.Tobacco?I was saving it... you have it...Well have it now... I don't smoke... take it...I was saving it for my birthday... I was going to give it to you then...Go on, smoke it... have it now...I know, Bobby... but that's how I feel about you, too... that's why we're friends... we try hard... come on... smoke your pipe...Come on... tell me... who would you rather be sitting here with... have a think...Yeah. He would be a help... but after Daniel Boone...No we're not... we're going to talk... all night... Bobby yields to this with the softest, most vulnerable smile we have yet seen on his face.So... where do you want to start?I know where you want to start...Alicia...I'm sorry...What do you mean, you're sorry... I'm the one that has to apologize...I've said who we are and where we're headed. Want to sign it, write anything?The peak we logged yesterday... I've named it Nathanial Mountain. After my boy... is that fine with you?North?What's wrong?Does it have to be bad? They might be friendly...What's wrong? *I'll do what you do. They leap to their feet and run. There is only one way to go, over the rise, through the women and children and across the stream. To the watching Indians it looks like a direct attack on their families. From behind trees and rocks they emerge and begin the chase. A tragedy of misunderstanding.They're not going to catch us. We're going home. Hector stretches out an arm to Bobby.Hold my hand, Bobby... They hold hands and run.What?This isn't really my building... it's my partner's... I just took the call and came right over... I have to leave town in an hour * or so anyway...3:35...Where is she? The Detective and Hector walk down the hall. They stop at the door of the bathroom. Hector looks inside. There is a large ragged hole in the floor. At the far side of it the toilet unit dangles at a dangerous angle into the hole, held only by its plumbing. Firemen are working to secure it and what is left of the floor with metal props and hydraulic jacks. Lying on the floor below, surrounded by rubble, and being attended by the paramedics, is an old lady, MRS. PHILIPPOPOLIS. She tries to sit up when she sees Hector peering at her over the rim of the hole. She looks angry.Not me, Mrs. Philippopolis... my ex-partner... I think you spoke * to him... How are you feeling? Hector says this clearly, for the benefit of the Detective and Mr. Santiago. The Detecitve is unimpressed.I'll make a couple of calls... I'll straighten it out... is she bad? Why don't they move her?She seems in good spirits...Boris... why did you do this to me? Get down here now... they want all kinds of certificates... They won't let me leave the building... I have my kids tonight, I haven't seen them in four years... I did tell you, I've been talking about it all week... how come they phoned me, this isn't my building? What? Don't tell me anymore... I want you here, now... and on your knee... I'll phone the lawyer... but you move. My weekend's ruined before it's started.Anna... thank God... you have to help me... I'm still in Queens... * I've got cops here and everything * ... I need your car... I don't have time to pick up the rental now... they won't let me leave the building... you come down here... and put my bag in the car... no.. * I have to pick the kids up by six, otherwise I fuck up her weekend too... she'll kill me... this is an emergency... what can I say? Please... right... okay...At the office... I might have some bills... it's not my building. * Santiago is talking almost to himself now, absorbed in the mundane mechanics of Hector's building.I don't really know...Can I do it Monday?Can I speak with Leonard, please... Mr. Deutsch? My name is Hector Troup, Borlonski and Troup, Real Estate... There is a moment's pause.Leonard... it's Hector... Borlonski and Troup... yes... listen, we've had a domestic accident at our Eighth Street building... a floor * ... and an old lady... she did mention the word sue, but it might have been hysterics... what I need to know is what certificates you have on file for the building... I * know it's Friday... just do one * thing... let me know if the insurance is current... I need to know that... I'm on my mobile... anything you have... before five ... thank you... During the call Hector has walked down the hall and back to the hole in the floor. He sees Mrs. Philippopolis, now strapped in a stretcher, being carried out of the room below. At the sight of him, she tries to sit up, straining on her straps.I'll be on the way in thirty minutes at the outside... I can't say... Queens to New Jersey, on a Friday... what do you think? I'll be there... it's important to me too, I've been trying to put this weekend together for years... I'll be there... I won't take it out on the kids, I can walk away from problems... as soon as I get the car... I'll be there... All the while Mrs. Philippopolis issues a non-stop * torrent of Greek expletives -- calmly and in a considered * tone, but obviously obscene. Hector is shocked. *I'm sorry about your mother...What?Well, I wasn't planning to...I've talked to your mother, given her my best wishes... she wants her family with her now... Any other Friday but this one.Look, George... here's what I can do... I'll visit her on Tuesday, I'll organize some flowers... lots... *They won't let me leave here... The Policeman this time backs him up.It's never been this bad, Boris. Deutsch is checking the insurance... did you bring the rest?What's with the we... it's your problem.She's a witch... her bones must be made of steel... she didn't break a thing... it might help if you make a visit to the hospital... why did you do this to me?I told you to stop doing that... why does this keep happening to me... my name is mine... use your own name, Boris Borlonski... will you remember that? Boris Borlonski!Yeah, I'm sorry too... you have to get out of this business... I thought I had...This is the worst it's been.You bring my bag?Sure. Thanks.Not much... just like I'm being executed...I'm glad you talked me into it.You're right... you're absolutely right... I was ready... I am ready, for everything... I'm fixing all that shit with Boris... I told him... it can't go on... I want my freedom. Anna is looking at him amusedly, nodding her head with every earnest pronouncement that he makes.... and the kids... that'll work out... we can have them over sometimes... Yeah?Right, when we have the space... when we get the bigger apartment... together...Yeah... I said it, didn't I?Yes I am... Together... I said it ... and get out of my car at the corner here... I don't have the time to go 'round the block.Thanks... for the car... everything...What? Anna, I can't...Hello... Leonard, hello... yes... we're insured... thank God... yes now I know God's a lawyer... thanks... On the outskirts of Jersey City he finds the suburban street he is looking for. If the last crosslight holds on green then he might even make it on time. Hector stops the car outside Janet's house and lets out a sigh of relief.Why didn't you say? I could have fixed up something else. I thought it would be a good place to get to know them again...Maybe this is a bit sudden for them... Maybe I should have come over a couple of nights and got to know them...Hi. They hardly lift their heads to him.Oh no... Jesus save me... what have I done...No... I can't face it, not just now... He looks at the kids.Let's go.Excuse me, kids... I have to consult the oracle...Hello... God? No, Leonard, it's Hector... just a joke... sorry to phone you at home, did Boris call you? The insurance is fine? Good ... but she could claim negligence ... oh, she's got a lawyer already? That's a bad omen... Betsy and Tom are listening in the back seat, eager for clues about this virtual stranger in front of them.Is there anything we can do right now... make her an offer... Sure, with the insurance company... sure... you're right... me, too... I have the kids in the car with me right now... sorry to bother you... 'bye...That's it! The last call... the weekend starts right now... we have things to do... look out for a Safeway... we need some supplies... and gas... oh my God, gas... soon... They return his look with blank expressions. He picks up the phone and offers it to them.Want to make any calls? Betsy? She shakes her head.Tom?But we called you Tom... that's what it says on your birth certificate...Right... it's your name... you * can do that... Safeway... keep your * eyes skinned... and I could murder * a Chicken McNugget. *What's wrong with that? It's a kitchen roll... why can't I pick a kitchen roll?Good point, Betsy... Betsy keeps on the attack.You're right.Well, get to it... I'll just tag along...Can I just keep a couple of those steaks? We can't live on chicken. *Don't mention the flowers.How about some eggs? They shake their heads.You don't eat eggs?Three. Is that all right?How about pancakes, Betsy... d'you like pancakes?I just wondered. Pancakes don't mean much to you?Nothing. The mystery of Betsy's pancake dream is evidently lost in infinity. Hector changes the subject.I thought we could walk into town this morning. I saw the Funfair when we came through last night.Let's take the walk anyway.No. We're taking a walk.Here's an umbrella... and there must be some old coats in here... and shoes... I only have these I'm wearing...I don't know if I want to wear Donald's shoes.Wow. Look at this. The kids' heights have been marked on the wall on some long-ago holiday. The dates are beside them.Six years ago. Look at that... What's this?It comes up every year?Where are the birds? Is it the wrong time of year?That's what Donald says?Please don't rain... please...Let's have a ride... He has stopped at some dated space rockets.Kitchen roll, unbleached, re-cycled, biodegradable... dry seats... Betsy has the grace to smile as the three of them climb aboard the rockets.This is ridiculous. Let's go somewhere and talk. Betsy smiles her small patient smile.How do we land these things?Sure you won't have a pancake, * Betsy? * Betsy gets impatient. *Okay, first question? *Well, that's a fair question... your mother and I got divorced... you're big enough to remember... she must have told you all that?You're right... what can I tell you... I went kind of crazy after that, for a good while... I came around a few times... remember?Well, it wasn't easy... everything with her and Donald happened pretty quickly. I missed you both really badly... but for a while I thought I should stay away, until your mother got settled... no, that's not really true... I missed you... but I was kind of crazy at the same time... your mother and I married young... I wasn't used to the freedom... it went to my head ... then you moved to New Jersey.You're right, you're right. I don't have too many excuses for the first year... the second year is easier... I was in jail. Hector is pleased with this. A solid excuse.We were doing government work, big contracts... there were some temptations... my boss asked me to shuffle a few papers... there was a lot of money in it... I had to testify against him... it was like killing somebody.You did?Well I appreciate that... but I'm glad your mother didn't let you. I'll tell you all about it some day. It was no fun. One year and eight months.I wasn't in great shape... I sure didn't want you to see me then... so I got back to work... in real estate... found a partner, we met * in jail... *Yes. We rent apartments... but we want to get into commercial property... people are a nuisance... does that sound bad? Betsy shrugs her shoulders.Just recently I've been feeling good, things have been going well... and I missed you two... so here we are...Who told you about her?Anna... she's nice... she wants to meet you, real soon... she sells flowers... well, you know that... and on Monday she's probably going to kill me...No... heck... no... did you think she was following us?She's right, Thomas... people should talk more.What do you mean? Is that what you thought? I was avoiding you two? No... you mustn't think that... that's terrible... They have almost exhausted themselves in this first bout of talking. Hector looks out at the sea.The rain's off. Let's go.Go on.I didn't leave because it was two days before your test... it was just what your mother and I decided... I taught you how to swim... we went to the pool twice a week... why would I leave?Oh, God, Betsy. I'm sorry.How did you do, in the test?Hey, Thomas! We're going home... we're having a barbecue... Betsy said she'll even let me eat a steak!Don't call him Tom, he doesn't like it.Your mother said it, when we split up... don't lose the children... didn't mean much at the time. But she was right.Betsy. On Monday will you come with me when I take the flowers back to Anna? I can't face her alone. She wants to meet you anyway.You'll be there, right beside me?Is that bad?Just tell them you were with your invisible dad.The funny thing is I fell in love with her before I ever saw her... I smelled her... It was the day I got out of jail... I was on the train and she was sitting behind me... it was just this incredible perfume... remember I'd been inside for nearly two years with four hundred sweating males... She got off the train and I followed her... I couldn't help it... that's how good she is... she listened to a bum who followed her off a train... Betsy looks at him kindly.... but she's still going to kill me on Monday...It's just like a big pancake up there, isn't it? Betsy doesn't take the bait. There is a silence.I remember when you two were tiny.. I used to watch you sleeping... it was like now... I felt close to you, could touch you... but you weren't there... you were gone... dreamland ... just when I was closest to you, you weren't there... I felt it last night, too.I'm not smart about things like that, usually.No?Is that a joke?Who are you? Who's inside there?Come on in, kids... that boat doesn't look too safe... They call back to him.I've just found you... I don't want to lose you. What would I tell your mother... come on in...Throw me the rope, Thomas, I'll pull you in. Thomas throws the mooring rope to Hector. It isn't attached to the boat. Hector ends up with all of the rope in his hands. He stands there, and they all laugh.This is one useless piece of rope, Thomas...I used to know how to do this...I did... I used to be really good at this... He wafts and blows ineffectually at a flicker of flame. There's not much of the caveman about him now.Ah... smell it... the smell of civilization... scorched meat... Hector serves the chicken onto their plates. He sits down beside them with his steak, and a glass of wine. He watches Thomas attack his chicken, and smiles.I'd forgotten that... how you eat... dedicated... like it's your religion!You used to hum to yourself too, when you ate... like everything was fine with the world. Thomas tries it out, eating and humming. It feels good to him. His head nods with the chewing and the tune.There she is... old Mercury...I'd forgotten... we used to watch * the stars... you could tell me the * names of all the planets... you * could recite them like a poem... remember... at the tiny window upstairs in the old house?Oh well, not to worry. I'm glad you still like astronomy though.Uh-huh?This is at school?Sounds like Donald said that...Well, I'm glad you two are thinking about the old planet. I'm proud of you. Look how beautiful everything is. Sometimes I think it's people that make it all wrong... we walk around with all our problems...Don't worry, you two... I'll tell you... it's just a big, black sheet up there with holes in it so the light comes through... that's the truth... the very latest... Hector has come to rest, and found peace at last, however temporary, here on the beach, beneath the same stars that our first Hector wailed at six thousand years ago. On Monday he will face the music. The kids will go back home, Mrs. Philippopolis will have to be dealt with, and the wilting three hundred dollar bouquet of flowers. In general, life will take over, on Monday. But at this moment of calm on the beach, let's leave him while he's ahead.No... I'll tell you... the whole thing... stars and everything... is sitting on the skin of a bubble of milk in a bowl of cornflakes... and somebody's just about to eat it... The three of them are laughing now.Okay... it's half-and-half... Perhaps that's just about as close as Hector and his * tribe of humans will ever come to working it all out. But they try. *Don't mention flowers, Betsy... please, not tonight.", "clean_line": "home leave stay stay hector takes steps boy follows away leave stay stay hill hill saw ll come morning food try

Bad omens. Get me something to eat. Just a mouse or two.He's a true friend, probably the only one I have left. Hector obligingly trots a step or two closer to Lucinnius to aid their conversation.He was honest about it. He said so, plain and simple. No.And the ships have gone... did I tell you that?Cyprian knows already. He'll want his money back too... We can see the concentration on Hector's face as he concocts appropriate responses. He has a tough occupation, being the alter ego to an ambitious loser in one of the most competitive and dangerous societies ever to exist. And he has to carry the stool and the towel as well.When we get home I want you to get some chickens... and fetch Hermas, the diviner.Are my ships from Sicily still afloat...?What do you mean?Do it again... I want you to do it again... Is it the Gods' will... * that Cyprian... be well disposed * towards me... in the future? *Cyprian loaned me half a million to fit out these ships... I'm * finished. Just when things were going well... I had plans for you too, Hector... in four or five years I was going to make you a free man... and then in ten years * you'd be a citizen... you... you * could've found your family... brought them here... everything...It does, doesn't it! Lucinnius is silent for a while as Hector continues to * rub his shoulders.I shouldn't give up. I can't... I'll visit Cyprian, first thing tomorrow... before the others can get to him... he's got to see reason... I can pay him back... sometime. It's the only chance we have, Hector. Should I do it?You're right. I must.Thalia, I think I need one of your massages. Hector, you can * finish the lamps. Hector does as he is told. He takes the torch from Thalia and discreetly leaves the room, hearing Lucinnius as he closes the door.Lower, Thalia.I can't sleep. Get me a chicken. I want to make another sacrifice. We'll do it ourselves.Relieved anyway... relieved that it's over at last. Lucinnius strides out of the courtyard with Hector following after him.I have to kill myself by tomorrow morning. He has all my letters to Titinius, none of them got through. He says it's like treason... and he says I should want to die for owing him half a million anyway...Then he will... and that wouldn't be pleasant... he would drag me to Rome... those letters... Lucinnius shivers to think of them.I'm done for, Hector... but it's strange... I feel kind of good about it... the struggle is over ... we've seen it through together, eh?Let's get home. We have a lot to do. Lucinnius quickens his pace.Tonight... peace at last... Lucinnius is obviously in a state of shock.We'll do it with a knife, Hector. When everyone has gone to bed. The two of us, to the end...We'll help each other, Hector. We must. We've been through this whole mess together... we must die together.You don't understand do you? I'm asking you to die with me... you're my closest, my dearest slave... what would they say about me if you refused to die with me? This is honor... we're choosing * death... we're not going to submit to the humiliations that Cyprian can heap on us, are we?Hector... at Cyprian's this morning ... I had to sign certain papers ... tell a bit of a story...A confession. That we were plotting against Cyprian and the provincial senate... we were short of names... most of the people I know were in the room... people I thought were my friends... so I mentioned you... I had to... Hector is stunned with shock...Yes. So you see, I don't want you to die with me just because of my honor... it's more complicated... I'm sorry, Hector. I would be honored... if you would die with me... I mean it... Hector manages to speak.Of course.If he eats the grain it means yes.No, it's saying yes, we should die.No, it's saying yes, we should die. The bird is certainly enjoying his food.Thank you, gentlemen... But I feel that I will be capable of taking care of my affairs tonight without your help... Thank Cyprian for his kind thought... The heavies metaphorically keep their foot in the door.Thank you. Good night.Thank you.Eight hundred sesterces... cash ... that's all that's left... what a failure... my father left me three farms and forty thousand...Nothing else to be done. Don't you want some wine?What is it?Hector, by this proclamation, I make you a freed man... I don't know the exact words... I've never done it before... But you're free, Hector.Very well...They'll find it in the morning. It's a nice thought, Hector... you were right to ask.Well... freed man, let's do it. *Nothing... I mean, not to me... I have to do it first... you understand that... and then you... if I don't succeed... then you must help me...No point in messing up the room. Let's go downstairs.Oh, that hurts, that stings! Lucinnius sits back on the step of the washing pool, holding his stomach. Hector sits down beside him. They both look down at the blade, still in Lucinnius' body.This is hopeless.Help me, Hector...Thank you, thank you. The movement has increased the spread of blood over Lucinnius' clothing. He raises his head.You do it now, Hector... hurry...Do it Hector... do it... you promised... It looks as if Hector is playing for time.Take it... do it...Do it, Hector... do it... do it... Hector has the knife in his hand, but still he waits, looking at Lucinnius, willing the last dregs of life from him.Do it... do it... do it... The whispers fade to a croak. Lucinnius lies still. Hector has won this final battle of wills. He stands up, suddenly repulsed by what has happened. But quickly he gathers his wits. He makes his decision. He throws the knife down. It clatters along the hard shiny floor. Hector has run out of the room before it has come to rest against the wall.", "clean_line": "going cool room bad omens hector bad omens eat mouse true friend probably left hector obligingly trots step closer lucinnius aid conversation honest said plain simple ships gone tell cyprian knows ll want money concentration hector face concocts appropriate responses tough occupation alter ego ambitious loser competitive dangerous societies exist carry stool towel home want chickens fetch hermas diviner ships sicily afloat mean want gods cyprian disposed future cyprian loaned half million fit ships finished things going plans hector years going free man years citizen ve family brought lucinnius silent hector continues rub shoulders shouldn ll visit cyprian thing tomorrow got reason pay chance hector right thalia think need massages hector finish lamps hector told takes torch thalia discreetly leaves room hearing lucinnius closes door lower thalia sleep chicken want sacrifice ll relieved relieved lucinnius strides courtyard hector following kill tomorrow morning letters titinius got says like treason says want die owing half million wouldn pleasant drag rome letters lucinnius shivers think hector strange feel kind good struggle ve seen eh let home lot lucinnius quickens pace tonight peace lucinnius obviously state shock ll knife hector gone bed end ll help hector ve mess die understand asking die closest dearest slave refused die honor choosing death going submit humiliations cyprian heap hector cyprian morning sign certain papers tell bit story confession plotting cyprian provincial senate short names people know room people thought friends mentioned hector stunned shock yes want die honor complicated sorry hector honored die mean hector manages speak course eats grain means yes saying yes die saying yes die bird certainly enjoying food thank gentlemen feel capable taking care affairs tonight help thank cyprian kind thought heavies metaphorically foot door thank good night thank sesterces cash left failure father left farms thousand want wine hector proclamation freed man know exact words ve free hector ll morning nice thought hector right ask freed man let mean understand succeed help point messing room let downstairs oh hurts stings lucinnius sits step washing pool holding stomach hector sits look blade lucinnius body hopeless help hector thank thank movement increased spread blood lucinnius clothing raises head hector hurry hector promised looks hector playing time hector hector knife hand waits looking lucinnius willing dregs life whispers fade croak lucinnius lies hector won final battle wills stands suddenly repulsed happened quickly gathers wits makes decision throws knife clatters hard shiny floor hector run room come rest wall"}, "BOBBY": {"raw_line": "They've gone... long gone!They've been gone a week, at least.We're ten days late...Cheer up. Have a look around. I'll start on a fire...Well done, my lad! Hector walks to the fire, pleased with himself. Bobby unfolds his fist and looks at what he has found, an Indian arrowhead with a few inches of broken shaft. He folds his hand over it again, keeping his secret. Behind them, nailed to a tree, is a plaque their companions have left. It reads, \"Pennsylvania Boundary Expedition 1761, Marker 152.\" Also on the plaque someone has written, \"We left here, 20th October.\"Even if we lose their track, we'll still hit the river... we can't miss that.Much too high. You won't find an Indian up here. We just have to keep our heads... no panic.You wouldn't... but he might be a Delaware if you did.Why not. We can log the peaks on the far side, just a couple of sightings a day... keep us busy...If we keep our heads. I wish I had some tobacco.Barometer... twenty-eight and three-eighths... temperature... * low... thirty-four... high... forty-two and a half... time...It's getting worse... you're nearly five minutes fast now...Exactly... you should throw yours away.I see her in the dewy flowers I see her sweet and fair... His voice rings sharply around the forest. Hector far ahead turns around, taken by surprise. Bobby has frightened himself too. He eyes the forest all around as the echo of his voice fades. Chastened, he begins to sing again, quietly this time, under his breath.There's not a bonny bird that sings But minds me o' my Jean...Let's get out of here.That was stupid...Sure I saw him.How the fuck should I know? He was an Indian... and Indians don't come in ones...I'm not going back down there.Why not? He runs off into the forest. Then he turns and shouts to Hector.Come on!Same as you.That's it... kind of short...That's the one.What've you got in there?A gun?We won't have a fire tonight. We should make a shelter though, in case it snows.Don't even think about bears, Hector.Maybe he's lost too... on his own... must be Delaware... they were chased up here years ago... everybody thought they'd cleared off west... the other side of Ohio... they were an angry lot... no wonder... they used to farm on the coast. He looks up at Hector, and allows himself a small smile.Go on, read it out... Hector looks up.I've had to listen to it every night since April... why not now?It wasn't funny then.I had a father like you... nine months on a whaler and then three weeks at home telling us all how much he missed us...Smell it?Goddam it... smell it?Where the hell is it coming from? He puts his head out of the shelter.I can't tell... a night like this it could carry for miles...I wish I had a smoke.What do you mean, you were saving it? You know the rules... no hoarding, tobacco or food... you've listened to me for a month, day and night... wanting a smoke...You've kept it from me, and you don't even use it...I have to wait until your birthday for a smoke? Who are you... the fucking king?I bloody won't... I'm not smoking on your command... I bloody won't. There is a brooding silence.God, your poor children... what do they have to do for a piece of candy in your house? It's very hard to like you sometimes... d'you know that?No... I'll have it in the morning.Daniel Boone?I can't think of anyone else... but you're impossible to like sometimes. Suddenly Bobby grows shy of their growing intimacy.We should sleep. We've got a lot of running to do in the morning. But Hector has other plans. He is in control of their friendship now.Well... what about Alicia?No... I'm sorry...Oh no you're not... It will be a worthwhile night for both of them.Isn't it a beautiful day? Hector finishes his writing, tears out the page from his book. He offers it to Bobby.No.I was going to call it Tobacco Mountain... or Mount Alicia... but Nathaniel's fine...Let's get away from here.Yeah. Keep the sun on our backs.We can move quicker without the horse... we just have to keep moving... we have to get away from here. Behind them they don't see the figure moving from the cover of one tree to another, and then another figure following the first. They move like ghosts.Quiet. They're on the other side...We're right in the middle of them...They were chased here... They should be on the coast growing corn...Oh-oh... *They're behind us. They must think we're stalking the women... Hector looks and sees nothing. Fifty Indians hold their breath. The forest seems empty. But Hector looks at Bobby. He is grey-faced, a man who is looking at death. Hector knows they are doomed.Do you want to run?When they catch up... fight... it'll be quicker... fight like hell...", "clean_line": "ve gone long gone ve gone week days late cheer look ll start lad hector walks pleased bobby unfolds fist looks indian arrowhead inches broken shaft folds hand keeping secret nailed tree plaque companions left reads pennsylvania boundary expedition marker plaque written left th october lose track ll hit river miss high won indian heads panic wouldn delaware log peaks far couple sightings day busy heads wish tobacco barometer eighths temperature low thirty high half time getting worse nearly minutes fast exactly throw away dewy flowers sweet fair voice rings sharply forest hector far ahead turns taken surprise bobby frightened eyes forest echo voice fades chastened begins sing quietly time breath bonny bird sings minds jean let stupid sure saw fuck know indian indians come ones going runs forest turns shouts hector come kind short ve got gun won tonight shelter case snows think bears hector maybe lost delaware chased years ago everybody thought cleared west ohio angry lot wonder farm coast looks hector allows small smile read hector looks ve listen night april wasn funny father like months whaler weeks home telling missed smell goddam smell hell coming puts head shelter tell night like carry miles wish smoke mean saving know rules hoarding tobacco food ve listened month day night wanting smoke ve kept use wait birthday smoke fucking king bloody won smoking command bloody won brooding silence god poor children piece candy house hard like know ll morning daniel boone think impossible like suddenly bobby grows shy growing intimacy sleep ve got lot running morning hector plans control friendship alicia sorry oh worthwhile night isn beautiful day hector finishes writing tears page book offers bobby going tobacco mountain mount alicia nathaniel fine let away yeah sun backs quicker horse moving away figure moving cover tree figure following like ghosts quiet right middle chased coast growing corn oh oh think stalking women hector looks sees indians hold breath forest hector looks bobby grey faced man looking death hector knows doomed want run catch fight ll quicker fight like hell"}, "BETSY": {"raw_line": "Hi.Are those for mom?What's wrong?It's bleached... and it isn't recycled... you don't care... you just buy junk... She picks up a more friendly brand of kitchen towel from the shelf and throws it into the cart. Hector has the sense to back down.Everything you buy is junk... I don't eat steak... and what's this... She prods a packet of frozen hamburgers.Ugh! Why don't you ask us what we like... it'll save you money... you buy junk, we won't eat it... A trace of girlish common sense has crept into her voice. Hector warms to her.I do it every week anyway.Are you going to bring the flowers in?Get me the books... all the books... all of the books... no, no, no... not the pancakes... not the pancakes... no... She changes in an instant from a bossy adolescent to a tearful, crumpled little girl. She sobs pitifully.... not the pancakes...How many have you got in there?For a week, maybe.Not much... why?They don't mean a thing. Why?The last two.They don't come over so much. The shellfish have gone... that's what...Yes... and it happens to be true.The seats are wet. Hector triumphs. He pulls a wad of kitchen roll from his pocket and starts to wipe the seats.All right, if you want to... Hector looks to Thomas. Thomas vigorously nods his agreement. Hector is happier. He looks down on the decrepit fairground.What he means is why did you stay away?Sure she has... but lots of people get divorced... that doesn't mean they disappear...It's forty minutes away on a slow bus...Thomas wanted to visit you in jail, but Mom wouldn't let him. * Hector looks at Thomas.That's what you do now?How should I know? Hector carries on with his story.What about your girl friend?Nobody.Shut up, Tom...Well, if people don't tell you things...I have to ask you something else.Why did you leave just two days before my swimming test? Hector is moved by the depth of her memory, her pain.I know... that's what I mean... why did you leave just then? Hector looks at Betsy. She is beginning to cry silently. He puts a tentative arm around her shoulder.It doesn't matter.I passed. Hector leaves his limp arm on her shoulder. It is too * soon for gestures of emotion. After a long moment she speaks.I'm a life-saver now.I'm allowed. Somehow Hector is touched by this.Who said I'd let you eat a steak? There is a silence. Then Hector speaks.Sure.I'd have to take the morning off school.No, that could be good...What's she like? How did you meet her?I think I'll paint the sunset tonight.That's what it's like... you should know that.Don't be so tough on yourself. You seem to want to be... you don't have to...No... we can do that...No, I mean it... look out for yourself... Hector looks at her in wonderment. One of those moments when another human being stands before you and is an utter mystery.You'll never know. Future generations of women are going to be just as unknowable to our Hectors as past ones were. Betsy moves off briskly along the beach. Hector trails after her, hooked.I thought he was taller.I suppose so. He's getting fat, too. I bet I could beat him at the breast-stroke now.We're fine! Hector tries to relax, but he doesn't have the confidence yet, or something. He is edgy.Why does it always go so fast...? Thomas is laughing at her. He has seen her attempt this before. Hector has other concerns. He is trying to light his barbecue. Match after match disappears into his elaborate stone structure, only to fizzle out.I don't know. If it wasn't for us there'd be nobody around to see it all. Hector stands to fetch another baked potato from the fire. We see the three of them in a WIDE SHOT, the evening sky now pulsing with more and more points of light. Hector's voice and laughter carry to us.Wait a minute... I know... the whole universe is inside a speck of dust that's lying in a ball of fluff in the cuff of a pair of pants hanging over the back of a chair...Skimmed milk...I've got a better one... we're all inside a speck of pollen that's stuck to the wing of a bee while it sits on a flower...", "clean_line": "hi mom wrong bleached isn recycled care buy junk picks friendly brand kitchen towel shelf throws cart hector sense buy junk eat steak prods packet frozen hamburgers ugh ask like ll save money buy junk won eat trace girlish common sense crept voice hector warms week going bring flowers books books books pancakes pancakes changes instant bossy adolescent tearful crumpled little girl sobs pitifully pancakes got week maybe mean thing come shellfish gone yes happens true seats wet hector triumphs pulls wad kitchen roll pocket starts wipe seats right want hector looks thomas thomas vigorously nods agreement hector happier looks decrepit fairground means stay away sure lots people divorced mean disappear minutes away slow bus thomas wanted visit jail mom wouldn let hector looks thomas know hector carries story girl friend shut tom people tell things ask leave days swimming test hector moved depth memory pain know mean leave hector looks betsy beginning silently puts tentative arm shoulder matter passed hector leaves limp arm shoulder soon gestures emotion long moment speaks life saver allowed hector touched said let eat steak silence hector speaks sure morning school good like meet think ll paint sunset tonight like know tough want mean look hector looks wonderment moments human stands utter mystery ll know future generations women going unknowable hectors past ones betsy moves briskly beach hector trails hooked thought taller suppose getting fat bet beat breast stroke fine hector tries relax confidence edgy fast thomas laughing seen attempt hector concerns trying light barbecue match match disappears elaborate stone structure fizzle know wasn hector stands fetch baked potato wide shot evening sky pulsing points light hector voice laughter carry wait minute know universe inside speck dust lying ball fluff cuff pair pants hanging chair skimmed milk ve got better inside speck pollen stuck wing bee sits flower"}}}
