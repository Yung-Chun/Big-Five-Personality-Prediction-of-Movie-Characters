You burn time in the vault.Surgical. Look at them separate the dye packs. Dick and Ronny know their jobs.What's he talking about, Angelo?Could've taken their gloves off before setting that card. Laser it for prints. Maybe held it to his teeth -- check the edges for saliva. Today was a scorcher. This Chevy doesn't have air conditioning...Well, what're your ideas on these guys?So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.Sorry.Yeah.

Uh, how do I get back in?My name's Johnny Utah!I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him.Bye.Tyler Ann Endicott.

Yeah, definitely.Shrimp and fries.I need you to teach me.I'm serious.Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.No, no. See, all my life I've done things for other people. In high school I played football because my old man expected me to. Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did. Football scholarship. Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right? But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals. And I hadn't been living my own life. So I wanted something for myself. Something that maybe didn't make any sense. You know what I mean?I came out here from Ohio a month ago. Never saw the ocean before. I didn't think it would effect me so much. Like I'm drawn to it, or something. I want to do what you do. It's the truth.Keep the change, Teach.Sure.Who's that?Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.Two years of surgery.

This was your lame-o idea in the first place. You gotta back me up on this.Angelo, pay attention. There's gonna be a test afterward. Lab is showing traces of toxins. PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right? And surfers are territorial. They stick mostly to certain breaks. If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?Whoa, brah, easy now... Don't move! Got some huge sucker crawling into your-- Got it! Uuuughhh.Saved your butt, bro. Close one.Latigo Beach.Big zippo so far.

He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House... ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.Cute. He was inside for about 20 minutes. The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck. They were scoping it out, right?!Yeah, or cashing a check.Wait, wait. Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit. Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit. You see? Summer's almost over. They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow. The next day at the outside latest. I got a feeling.Angelo... I'm right this time. We can still win this one.Woof, woof.They're gone. Son of a bitch. We missed them.No way. Not yet. Come on.I say we call it in. Get some backup. But you gotta do it. Harp won't listen to me.I say we don't call it in. Under no circumstance are we to call this in.Angelo, it's eleven thirty.Here, yours is the one that looks like a road kill. Enjoy.Here's your lemonade. Did you see that T-Bird pull up?FBI!! Freeze!! Right now!The hell are they?!You sure?!I got 'em. I see 'em. I'm on it, I'm on it.Not now. Not now!Nothing.Feta. My favorite.I don't know.Ouch.You're kneeling on my hand.Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.I'm glad you pulled me out of the water that day...Tyler, put the gun down.No. They live in Columbus Ohio.I work bank robbery. Guys I'm after are surfers. I needed you, at first, but not--Tyler! Wait!!Tyler I... look, I fucked up, okay. I know I fucked up. I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't -- I was afraid you'd leave... good guess, huh? Fuck, why can't I ever say what I really mean? I lied to you. I'm an asshole... but I need you, Tyler. I want you to know that I've never known anyone like you before in my life... and I... I hope you change your mind...Tyler! Wait, I--What going on, Bodhi?I don't think I wanna surf right now.How you figure?Takes guts to rob a bank. All that adrenalin pumping, waving loaded guns, taking out the guards, getting everybody on the floor, never knowin' who's gonna burst in... ... wondering what it's like to take a bullet. Must be some ride.One shot stopping.Nice.Once.Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--Oh, well, that's fine then. I feel so much better.So, who... uh, who packed my chute?You gotta earn trust.We gonna jump or jerk off?Whoooaaah! Shhiiittt! Whoooaaah!Great! GREAT!After you, Alfonse.

There's a gun on you right now.Where's Roach?You gotta tell me where she is.Look, Bodhi man. People are dead. The ride is over.The guy you killed was an off duty cop! If you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land. They have a new thing called radar. Maybe you've heard of it.I know you man, when they fall on you, you won't back down. They'll have to burn your ass to the ground. And I can't stop them... I'm the last person they're ready to listen to right now. Thanks to you.Shit may or may not happen.Look, you got a death wish, you want to ride to glory... fine! But don't take her with you, man. I'm begging you... tell me where she is. Then I walk away. We've earned that much trust, haven't we?Angelo! Don't fire!NOOO!!NNNOOOOOO!!!You're cold because all the blood is running out of your body, Roach. You're going to be dead soon. I hope it was worth it.Tell him to release Tyler.What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order. Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose. Do it, man, you owe me that much. Let me hear it before you check out.FUCK IT!!!Pull the parachute!!No games, Bodhi. Pull the cord! Now!!Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!You fucking crazy!? Pull it!!SHIT!!Jesus Christ, Bodhi!Storm's already here... It's bringing me the swell.No. But he's here.No problem.

Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.Pappas. Angelo Pappas.Welcome to Sea World, kid.Twenty-seven banks in three years. In and out in 90 seconds. Nobody ever gets shot. We're talking solid professionals.Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.Never go for the vault. They never get greedy.Reagan usually drives. Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance. When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish. And I mean vanish.The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.Just take the tape, Cole.What? Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?Cole and Munoz? I been on this case for two years.Yeah, I get it. Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?Sure. No problem. How about your office? Your office need vacuuming? We could do that too.Excuse me.Cute huh? They love to fuck with us.Don't tell me, let me guess. The switch-car was stolen this morning... They vacuumed and 409'd the interior, did the windows, emptied the ashtrays...You through, Mr. Wizard? Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it. Hell, it's only 7:30. The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.Forget about it, kid. They're ghosts. Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it. See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right? They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public. Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?You watch your fucking mouth! Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here!Yeah. That was thirty years ago anyway. L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean. So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents? Be a big hero?The fucking punks are surfers.I'm tellin' ya, kid, it's in our face. Lookit the tan on this guy.Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample. Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax. So I became a wax expert. There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.Now lookit the dates on the robberies. This is strictly a summer job for these guys.Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.The Ex-Presidents rip off banks to finance their endless summer!\"Best for your stick\", huh? This might not be enough. I better get two.Johnny, it's the only way.Look. Look at them out there.They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language. You can't just walk up to these guys.

No convection.What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?Johnny, all I can say is we better come up with something real soon.Yeah, yeah, I remember, last year. Guy got his jaw broken for it.Hell, what're we waiting for, let's go pick the guy up.Guy's the Toxic Avenger.No. But let's do it, anyway. It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.When you two are done makin' out, I need to talk to you.I just want to know if you surf here a lot.Not exactly, dudes.He moved.Surf's up, ace.Patience hotshot. Patience. It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.Johnny? You there?Uh, you guys seen a kid, maybe 10, 12, running with a car stereo?

Whole house smells from it's liftin' its leg all the time...You sure he isn't out back? You mind if I go take a look?Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?FBI, gorgeous. Now let's take a look around--Speak into the microphone.It's always been lasers and paper targets until today, right?No difference, Utah. Just a little more to clean up. It's alright.

You okay?Listen, uh... if you're okay, can it wait till tomorrow morning, kid, I...This Zen master surfer.Did he rob it?Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.Alright, look... banks are closed. Nothing's gonna go down tonight, right? So we'll be on these guys like white on rice... first thing tomorrow morning. Okay? Tomorrow. Okay?They're on their way to Maui.Jesus Christ, kid! The banks don't open 'till nine.Sure. No problem. I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious. Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay? We cover the bank, whatever. You and me. That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.Time for lunch.That place up the street has meatball sandwiches. Get me two.Damn, I could eat the ass out of an elephant. I shoulda had you get me three a these. What T-Bird?Jesus Christ!! It's them!Come on, kid, get in the car!

They get anything even resembles your guy, I'm on your beeper. Here. You like feta?Johnny...All I wanna know is one thing, why didn't you just take the shot?He knows his goddamn rights! Jesus, kid. I knew you were getting too close to these guys. Gimme the goddamn key to these things, Cole. Christ!Look, Harp. Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk. Let me ride him in.Harp, let me tell you something.

Whoa! Hold it, ladies. Give it a rest. Let's go.Do me a favor, Johnny, just keep walking.The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild. The other two always hang. They think they're some kinda death squad around here.They're punks. Nazis. Their brains are wired wrong. They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea.

Just you and the wave.I've watched you once or twice. You surf like it's some kind of street fight. You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you. Always trying to win.The only way to win out here is to surrender. You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync. Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.This one's got your name on it, Johnny.Let's go.C'mon brah, there's a righteous swell. Let's go!

Just gotta scare 'em a little, would be my guess. Now if I was gonna rob a bank, with all those guys wearin' body armor these days, know what I'd carry?.454 Casull. Most powerful handgun on the planet. Muzzle velocity of 2000 feet per second. Twice the kinetic energy of a .44 Magnum.'One shot stopping'... good, very good. I like you, Johnny. I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win. I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it. Check out the weight.Whoa. Careful. You got the muzzle pointing right at me, brah.It's a special day, Johnny U. A very special day...Ever done this before?Pure adrenalin, right?! The ultimate rush. Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.Yeah, I noticed you limping. But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all. We're not gonna land on land!It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer. One last speedstar.I did. What's the matter? Don't trust me?Then we'll earn it together. Here, take mine.My man!Utah, you copy bruddah?I'll take that as a yes.Ten thousand feet. Let's do it.Come on Johnny. Get in here!Relax, brah. I got you, I got you.You diggin' this?Purty-thirty and we're meat waffles, folks. See ya downtown!You gonna pull?Don't screw around man, pull it!One thousand feet. Pull the goddamn cord!Okay!Ya see... I told you Johnny U was gonna be just fine!C'mere. There's something you need to see.Insurance policy. Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah. Press play.She's a wild one, isn't she... Special Agent Utah?Whoa, whoa!! Think it through! I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything. At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see... ... six hours from now.Sorry, can't do it, brah. He's on the road. And where they're going there's no phones. Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do. I hate violence. See, that's why I need Rosie. I could never make this thing work, myself. No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once. We shared time in this world. But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism. Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness. Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes. Nothing I can do, unless I get there.So that makes us partners, doesn't it? Because now we both have the same goal... to get me where I need to go. Right?See! That's what I like about you, man! You're just sharp as a razor blade.Get the plane down to Santa Monica and top up the tanks. Let's go. Let's saddle up!Okay. All I'm askin' for is ninety seconds of your life, Johnny. That's all.It's basic dog psychology, brah. If you scare them, get them pissing down their leg, they submit... you control them. If you project weakness, you draw aggression... that's how people get hurt.Fear causes hesitation, and hesitation will cause your worst fears to come true. You project strength to avoid conflict.Here, you need this. You can't be comin' through that door with your dick in your hands, right?Sure you can! You may even like it... it's a killer rush. You'll see. Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?Wild, ain't it?! See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I. We make our own rules. Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?Ninety seconds, man, door to door. A small price to pay for someone who loves you. She does you know. It's not her style to fall so hard... I don't think she did with me.Sorry, Johnny. Guess you don't get to be president.Rock and roll!Everybody freeze!! Don't move!!Don't anybody fucking move!Goodbye, Johnny.But you're not alone.Around somewhere. Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U. What can I do for you?And let my policy expire? Sorry.I say when it's over!Back in the hotseat, campadre. NOW!Thanks for telling the nice FBI agent where we're going.We're gonna ride this out, all the way, Johnny. You and me. Let's go.Yeah, get some height. Take her up to eight thousand on this heading.Doesn't matter now. We're almost there, man. Here, let me help you get your gear on.You're gonna be fine. Just fine. Johnny, toss me that money bag will you. Easy does it.Hey, Johnny's just trying to psych you man, forget it. Just keep thinking about all those senoritas nursin' you back to health. Come on, amigo, let's get you set for the jump.Rosie, Rosie, this is Air Force One, do you copy, over?Why should I?Rosie, listen carefully. Surgery is canceled, is that clear? Repeat it back to me.I know it's hard for you Johnny. You want me so bad it's like acid in your mouth. But not his time. Let's go.You lose, campadre.Pretty radical, Johnny. Even for you. Why don't you pull it?Naw, you pull it!Go on, Johnny. Pull it. But you gotta drop the gun, first! Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man. Do it! Come on, you want to do it. You're gonna die, Johnny. Five more seconds. Four...Three seconds... two... one...Wild ride, huh?That pesky knee, huh? Too bad.You had me worried there, for a second, Johnny U.And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.You never were...It went bad, brah. Real bad. I just felt it was time...Time to dance with the universe. I could never handle a jail cell. You'll do this for me, won't you Johnny? Haven't I earned this much?Thanks, brah.", "clean_line": "hey tyler chill brah know johnny utah ohio state conference rose bowl years ago right happened got nuked quarter went pro mmm lawyer huh bad surfing life right let seriously alright warchild whoa whoa hold ladies rest let favor johnny walking decked bunker wiess big brother warchild hang think kinda death squad punks nazis brains wired wrong hurt surfing respect sea want radical mindless aggression ll spiritual beach saw going hesitate backed inch rare world nada come tyler knows bets afford lose way committed bells beach australia mistake pray ll tragic die love want ultimate thrill gotta willing pay ultimate price johnny demons johnny feel gentlemen time let utah time little stealth mission yeah crazy football man game score numbers field rules opponent wave ve watched twice surf like kind street fight jerk moment moment fighting comes trying win way win surrender feel wave accept energy sync feel moving blackness need got johnny let mon brah righteous swell let let howdy brah mon gear rollin hey happened ya cut shaving naw different johnny totally different gonna love mon let let time wastin brah life sure got sick sense humor think johnny news night guys ex presidents robbed bank yesterday day cashing check look assured trust place picking bucks cause leaving town bizarre huh waited day right middle kinda sorry missed liked ve seen banks insured brah long gets shot victimless crime gotta scare em little guess gonna rob bank guys wearin body armor days know carry casull powerful handgun planet muzzle velocity feet second twice kinetic energy magnum shot stopping good good like johnny like ll sacrifice win respect elevates little drones learned compromise hold check weight whoa careful got muzzle pointing right brah special day johnny special day pure adrenalin right ultimate rush guys snort jab vein gotta jump yeah noticed limping worry brah worry gonna land land little ceremony end summer speedstar matter trust ll earn man utah copy bruddah ll yes thousand feet let come johnny relax brah got got diggin purty thirty meat waffles folks ya downtown gonna pull screw man pull thousand feet pull goddamn cord okay ya told johnny gonna fine mere need insurance policy going sting bit growth brah press play wild isn special agent utah whoa whoa think knows let talk second ll fine rosie won long meet certain place time let hours sorry brah road going phones damn hate johnny hate violence need rosie thing work way hold knife tyler throat man woman shared time world rosie kind mechanism set motion won stop gift kind blankness noon comes straight ll gut like pig try shoes makes partners goal need right like man sharp razor blade plane santa monica tanks let let saddle okay askin ninety seconds life johnny basic dog psychology brah scare pissing leg submit control project weakness draw aggression people hurt fear causes hesitation hesitation cause worst fears come true project strength avoid conflict need comin door dick hands right sure like killer rush ll hey things johnny wild ain exist higher plane rules servant law johnny master ninety seconds man door door small price pay loves know style fall hard think sorry johnny guess president rock roll everybody freeze anybody fucking goodbye johnny listen kind hurry johnny let policy expire sorry hotseat campadre thanks telling nice fbi agent going gonna ride way johnny let yeah height thousand heading matter man let help gear gonna fine fine johnny toss money bag easy hey johnny trying psych man forget thinking senoritas nursin health come amigo let set jump rosie rosie air force copy rosie listen carefully surgery canceled clear repeat know hard johnny want bad like acid mouth time let lose campadre pretty radical johnny pull naw pull johnny pull gotta drop gun right use hand gonna hold way gonna happen man come want gonna die johnny seconds seconds wild ride huh pesky knee huh bad worried second johnny knew count agent utah went bad brah real bad felt time time dance universe handle jail cell ll won johnny haven earned thanks brah"}}}
