{"Fletch": {"FLETCH": {"raw_line": "So what do you figure?No idea at all?Like when?For sure?I think I\u2019d rather have drugs.Maybe tonight?That's what he said.I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.Wonder who his supplier is.I wasn't asking.I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.Creasy, how old are you?You're not taking real good care of yourself.What?Why not?Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?Nugent. Ted Nugent.Charmed.I always liked this part of town.What a coincidence.I came this close... ...to buying this placeThen I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange.I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.I commend you on your Spanish.Ahh, the library. Masculine but sensitive.Really, I love what you've done with the place. Must have cost you...hundreds.I'm all ears.You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.Why don't you try suicide?So why pick me?Maybe I'm just on vacation.Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?I'm still here.Wouldn't they normally be locked?I have the same problem with my help.I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.A .357.So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.I don't think you'll have to worry about that.Sure, all drifters do.Take it where?Where am I going?They serve dinner on the flight?You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?You sure those doors will be open?The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.You sure got the hard part.Sure.Thank you so much Hey, Larry!Can I steal you for a minute?Deal.Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.Don't say shoot, okay.Did you hear something?Me neither. See what we've got on a guy named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away.W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?Uh, almost.And a damn fine one, I might add.Two....Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?I never read the paper.What's the spread on the game tonight?Looks great.'Shame of Our City' is so good.Why not? Oh $hit...really?Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.Practically.I have pictures of him. Dealing....He's not the story! There's a source behind him.Well, there we're in a gray area.I'd say charcoal.Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God. I hope.'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.''Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'Spot right here.Thanks.Maybe.'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.I wonder if that's his doctor.We play tennis at the club.Yes.Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.That's Babar.One. B-a-b-a-r.But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.I don't know. I don't have any.No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.Mrs. Smith.Right.Margaret.Is she ever. I've got some stories....It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.Sure, but the end was so sudden.Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden. You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that....Honest, I feel fine. You better be married.Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh -- Ever serve time?Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?Right. Fine.Not recently.Uh, I'm not really prepared. My hands aren't sterilized.Where am I?I'm fine.Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.Thank you.My associates did a biopsy on this man recently. He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.That's it?This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.He'll be so relieved.Christ.What about breaking and entering? Are you wearing anything under that?I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.One on one?And the foul.She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that....My lawyer was a bum.I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.Are you serious?Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.I think I just won a million dollars!Damn...lost again. Sorry.Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.Thank God.Gail Stanwyk!I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.We used to fly together. I'm...John.John Ultrarelamensky.It's Scotch-Rumanian.So were my parents.Please.Yes, I'm with the Underhills.They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?Preoccupied with what?Good. Lobs are a very important part of the game.Why do you keep doing this?Try stepping into the ball with your left foot.There, much better.I have this effect on lots of women.Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?You are a rich woman.What's he doing in Utah?...then who walks in but George Bush. He took one look around the room......and said 'Sorry Mr. President, I thought it was Saturday.'I thought I was going to die.Thank you.Okay.First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even ---Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?God I admire you.Comanche Indian.Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?Yeah.Frieda's boss.My secretary.Larry, it's me....See if you've got anything in Stanwyk's background from when he lived in Utah. Also check on a realtor in Provo named Swarthout. And tell Frank I'm crazy about him and I'd like to discuss his maybe moving in with me.Later.They're after Gummy again. It's weird.Hey, what are you doing?You don't have to run with me, Crease.Why are you beating up on that kid?He's defenseless, and you kick the crap out of him. What do you want from ---What goddamn right do you have to take him?They didn't do anything.I busted their window, they didn't do anything.Not luck. They don't want me.Gummy and two cops....Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?She needs me, Frank.That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while.All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.Yeah.More cops. I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.I have some ideas.Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.Nothing to it.Hi, Jim Swarthout, please. Oh, hello, my name is Igor Stravinski and I'm looking for some ranch property.No, I just heard some people at the club talking about the property you sold him, and the way it was described, three million sounded like a pretty good price. What?Are you sure? Of course. I guess I was misinformed. Listen, I'd love to come out and see you anyway. When are you available?Tomorrow.What's your name fella? Fluff? Pom-pom?Sh*t.Sit-tuh!Roll over. Play dead. Good boy.You any relation to Doctor Dolan?I hate this.Make sure nobody comes in, okay?So much for your three million dollar ranch.Suck on this Cujo!Gimme a smile! There you go...oh, that's a nice one... Everything's fine, now...go take a little nap....Look! Defenseless babies!That dog is such an A**hole.'Bil-lie, Bil-lie...'If I took that out, you guys couldn't fit in here.You just planted that.Read me my rights.Hold it! I'll waive my rights.I hear he's mellowed a lot since he came out of the closet.You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?Fletch.Fletch F. FletchI'm President of the International Fletch Corporation.Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probaly explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.It was planted on me, sir.'Your men' might just be involved in all this.Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great.I don't like Tommy Lasorda.You can't keep me here.I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights.My God, you're serious.Can I ask anybody now?Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?Not a prayer.Not at all, Chief. But next time...no tongue, okay?How could you call him?It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.You'll have it.Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.Print this Frank.Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?One.I would, actually.Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.This is just the nicest place.It's John. John... Znhcneelsky.Hi.I was hoping you'd say that.Can I borrow your towel for a minute?I ordered lunch.Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.Here, take mine.Yes.Lunch....Come on in.No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.Sierra del fuego.I saved his life during the war.No. He was. I got him out.'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes....''I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching....''But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'Can I ask you a question?Are you still in love with Alan?Why'd you let me in?Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?Good point.What about his parents?How come?Thanks for the great time.Long story.Take one end.I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.Yeah.Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.That's what I want to know.He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.You saw a forgery.That's the real deed.Now, if this were at all legible, you'd believe me.Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented....I don't know. All I know is that he told me a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true.I'm really sorry I have to tell you all this.No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan?I'll take you to a game.I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.Act natural.If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?Jesus.Should've known. Goddamn it.Great. First I'll get a speeding ticket, then they'll shoot me. Terrific.All right, fella, smog check. Move over.Sorry, youngster, but we have to see what kind of fluorocarbons this thing puts out at ninety-five.Don't worry about the speed limit. That's what the police escort's for.Holy sh*t.Okay, kid. Just stand here with your hands on the car and wait for the cops. I gotta pee. Here, take my hat.Hello. I'm with the hotel catering. Are you enjoying your meal? Carrots overcooked?Thank you, Tony, thank you. As a lifelong friend of.... ...Fred Dorfman, I'm thrilled to be here.Many of you are probably not aware of Freddie's lifelong commitment to honoring a profession that frequently goes unsung -- the police. Many times Fred used to forsake a night with his wife and children to go out an sell tickets for the Policemen's Benevolent Association.Our men in blue are with us today, and I think we should all extend a shake of the hand, a slap on the back and a 'howdy' to them.When was the last time you hugged a cop? Do it for my good friend Tommy Lasorda. Doesn't it feel good? Don't you wish you'd done it long ago?Let them know how we feel, with a song. For every cop on every beat in every city of this great nation. 'For he's a jolly good fellow....' Everybody! 'For he's a jolly good fellow....'You're kidding.So he's going. Uh...are there any other tickets charged to the same account?Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and...is there anyone in the seat next to me?Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.What?Oh, thanks.'Bom-ba-bom-bom...bommmm.'The door was unlocked.No wonder.I commend him on his choice.I commend him on his choiceI was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's.Where is she?She moved out?I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.So you're saying she moved out.This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and Fredo, are taking over.Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.I'm her cousin.Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.I'm getting real tired of all this hostility.Evening. They oughta recall these things. One bump,the whole window goes.Are you Mr. Marvin Stanwyk?I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.My parents were great fans of the former President.Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.Right.I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub-insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?First, a couple of routine things: are you and you wife currently alive?Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?Okay. Now, the last time you saw your son was when?Ten days ago?Isn't that nice. Since when?Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.I'm sorry?You've met her?Has Alan ever mentioned the name Sally Ann Cavanaugh?Has he?Then he has.Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?And they're still married...Alan and Sally Ann.How long have they been married?Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to ---No, thank you.Frank told you that?You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.'welluh bless my soul whatsuh wrong with me? I'ma itchin' like a man Inuh fuzzy tree....'Yeah...No kidding. The Marriott at LAX. Sonofabitch...Checked in this morning. Great. Thanks a million. And call Gail Stanwyk at the Racquet Club. Tell her I have to meet her tonight. Eight o'clock at the club. Urgent and confidential. Thanks.Question:Question....What's wrong with my life?Question: Why does a man marry a millionaire's daughter in Beverly Hills if he is already married to a girl who lives in a crappy one bedroom apartment in Utah? Answer: Three million dollars. Big Question: What's with Stanwyk and Cummings? I don't know. Bigger Question: Why does Stanwyk want me to kill him?Biggest Question: Why do I eat this sh*t? Miss, I believe this has already been eaten.What's wrong, Gail?No.I think you better sit down.Gail, please.I got this from Alan's parents. By the way, they see him all the time.I checked.

Lie down, Gum.Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.Sit back down.Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.Sure you did.Twenty years.Can't do a thing with this robe. One more question, Gum...don't look at me.Where does the Chief get the drugs?Rio de Janeiro, maybe?That's Brazil.Wait here for me, Gummy.It's the only way you'll be safe. Believe me.You don't know me.I'm serious, Sam.Affirmative.Affirmative.For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy game me a deposition.I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or ---You don't have a piece of the action?Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.What?Gum thought Brazil.I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy.Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard.

I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.Read this, please.Cut the crap and read it.Unless my people hear differently, this letter goes out at midnight.Pretty hefty. Keep reading.You shouldn't be here.He doesn't read my stuff well. 'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.' That was stupid, Alan.Ahem. 'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.''By the way, Alan is a very big drug smuggler, but you can read all about that in tomorrow's paper. Sincerely yours, I.M. Fletcher. P.S. Have a nice day.'The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.How similar in build you and I are. then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.Whoops.That is a lighter, isn't it?Thank God, the police.Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?Whoa. Well, you two obviously have a lot to talk over, so we'll go catch the last ten minutes of Dynasty....with your money.Go ahead. Make my evening.I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.Away. I think it might take you a while to get your life back together. You don't need me around. Don't go back in there.You sure did.Far out. Larry? It's Fletch. Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but...any port in a storm. Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months.

I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.Oh, mine! Thank God. Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?John! You used to fly together!John who?Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.That's a strange combination.Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.Damn, I thought I had that one.What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!Who is it?John Ultramalensky?Hi.Uh...I'm just out of the shower.I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think...What do you want?You ordered it here?Down boy.I really should change.I mean put clothes on.Stop that!Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?God....All this goes on Underhill's bill?You were in the war?I can't believe I'm doing this. Well, lets eat.It's amazing.Your bone structure, shoulders, neck....Just like Alan. It's freaky.Depends on the question.No. I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.He never sees them and I never met them.Yes?What is this?John!You don't know the Underhills?I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?I think you should call me Gail, now.Why did you do it?A four hundred dollar lunch tab!I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?Who.So?What are you talking about?In a minute!How do you know about that?What does all this mean?Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in ---But I've seen the deed.Stop it. Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?Just wait, all right?!? I'm going to call my father. He'll know what ---Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.No...I've got to go to Mr. Underhill....What are you talking about?Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?I was afraid you'd say that.Sorry. Here. Thanks. Bye.I want you to know that dramatic phone calls about secret meetings scare the sh*t out of me.I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.So I told him...I told him I was just cold or something.I've never lied to him before. It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'Oh God, I hate things that start like that....What is this....Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???Bastard.I'm calling the police. Right now.Don't tell me I can't ---Your twenty-four hours are up, Fletch.I'm terrified.Don't worry, I can take it.I want to hear this.My God, Alan, you really are and a**hole, aren't you?You sonofabitch.'Whoops?'
