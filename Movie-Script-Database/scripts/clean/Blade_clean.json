{"Blade": {"BLADE": {"raw_line": "Where is Deacon Frost?Got something in your throat.Frost.Now don't we look dapper?Whistler!She's been bitten.She hasn't turned yet. You can help her.Just do it, old man.You shouldn't be here.-- he's a vampire.Stupidity.It's not worth the risk. We can't trust her.Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.Then I have to take you out, just like any other bloodsucker.We hunt them, moving from one city to the next, tracking their migrations. They're hard to kill. They tend to regenerate.I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.Get in. You\u0092re leaving.Remember what we said. Keep your eyes open. They're everywhere.You okay?Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.It worked, didn't it?He didn't. Get over it.He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner -- This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high.How 'bout you, Officer? You a good little bloodhound?Looks like our friend was blood-running. Where were you headed?Preventive medicine.It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!God-damnit!!! Do you have any idea what you just did?! He'll warn them. They'll be waiting!Let me set you straight on something, Doctor. What you've \"seen\" so far is nothing. The world you live in's just the sugar-coated topping. There's another world beneath it, the real world -- and it's a fucking bloodbath. If you want to survive in it, you'd better pull your head out of your ass.What the hell are you doing?! I could have killed you!Do you have a death wish or are you just stupid?There is no cure.What do you see here?Look closer.This isn't a gang tag, it's a vampire marking. It means there's a safe-house nearby. A place they can go if dawn is coming.Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city, and just like Domino's, they always deliver. You telling me you're ready to walk through that door?All right, then, listen up, Vampire Anatomy 101. Crosses and running water don't do dick, so forget what you've seen in the movies.You use the stake, silver, or sunlight, got it?Know how to use one of these?Safety's off, round's already chambered -- Silver hollow-points filled with garlic. You aim for the heart or the head, anything else is a one-way ticket to a pine box.Get out. Now.I know you're blood-running. Who's your sponsor?What's this? A birthmark?Still think we might be wrong? How much are you shipping?I've got a message for your masters -- the night's no longer safe for their kind.He will.Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them. See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.The way they move, they way they smell --The whore on the corner, she's one too. So are the two men standing under the streetlight.There are worse things than vampires out there.Like me.Where's the entrance?!I got news for you, butt-boy. You're already dead.After you.Some kind of archive --You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.This must be where they keep their records --Frost?Don't be. You're another notch on my sword hilt, nothing else.A sun lamp. We're gonna play twenty questions. Depending on your answers, you might get to have yourself a tanning session.What were you in such a big hurry to delete just now?And who is LaMagra?Where's the original, Pearl? You must have it around here somewhere.If he moves, cook him.That's the point.I'm expecting some company.He can take care of himself! GO!!!Nothing that won't heal by dawn.I need help with this --Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.Not quite. I'm a hybrid. Half-human, half-vampire.Don't even start, old man.You get used to the darkness.I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.Just get out of here.I said, GET OUT!!!China Town. I need more serum. What's all this?For your miracle cure?Cancer.We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.I'd wish you luck, Doc, but I never put much stock in optimism.How's it going, Kam?I was in the neighborhood.Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.Yeah. I know.Thanks, Kam. One other thing. Have you ever heard of a vampire called the Sleeper?I found this in there archives. I need to find someone who can read their language.How can you be out here?I don't buy it.Maybe I don't see it that way.You're wrong.Pass.You're not going anywhere.Any progress?You don't look so good.It's started.You've got another day or two at most.For what it's worth, I'm sorry.I'm here to see Miracia. Kam sent me.You're blind --I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.Who is LaMagra?His blood -- ?\"The Blood Tide\".How do I stop it?But I just got here --WHISTLER?!Jesus, Whistler, what did they do to you?Don't try to talk --No, we can treat the wounds --Whistler, I can't.Whistler, I --You should be. I've made some improvements.Mother -- ?!But you -- died --Fight him --Please --I've been better --How long have we been driving?We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.What are you talking about?-- go to hell --I'd kill myself -- before I turned into something like you.How could you be a part of this?You don't have to be.I don't believe that.Mother!Get out of here --You don't understand. The Thirst ---- tearing me -- apart.No --I can't -- I won't be able to stop --NO!!!!Never been better.Frost!!!Who dies first?Let's see if you can grow a new one of these!Next?Where are you?!Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.You don't have a few minutes, Frost.It's because I'm human that I can do this.For them.

They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them. Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.I thought you promised to give me some distance?Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about \"us\".You haven't started in on the internal organs?What?Sometimes ---- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.My shoulder -- dislocated --What -- ?I'm sorry, I --Who are you people?You're joking --Why did you help me?Why?What happens then?So what do you use, then? A stake?And you honestly expect me to believe all this?I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.That's ridiculous! No one's that powerful.So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?I need the police. This is an emergency --Hello? My name is Karen Jansen, I was with Curtis Webb at Mid-Town Hospital last night -- that's right, I witnessed the attack -- 115 Aurora, apartment 3G. Yes, I'll wait here. Please hurry.Get a grip on yourself, girl.Who is it?Yes, that was me, I'm Karen Jansen --I know. Listen -- do you have any idea what happened to Curtis, the other doctor?Why?He said it would work against vampires --How did you know?You used me as bait?!But, he could've --But he's a policeman --Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?And that's a good thing?What are you doing?!You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.You were going to kill him. What was I supposed to do?! Shut my eyes and pretend I didn't see what I saw?I remembered the address. I followed you --Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.You don't know that.What are you looking at?Graffiti --I know this place -- it's a blood bank.No.What if you've made a mistake?You let him go -- An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.How can you tell?So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.Like what?What is this place?Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.He moved.What are these?How did you find us?!You've been listening in the whole time?Whistler!You're hurt --What am I injecting you with?You're one of them, aren't you?Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?What happens if he doesn't take the serum?No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.Why do you hunt them?He killed them?How did you escape?And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?I'll take my chances.Blade?It's dark in here.Whistler told me about your mother.Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.Blade --I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.This is sodium citrate. It's an anti-coagulant. We use it to treat blood-clots sometimes. Vampire blood is thinner than humans, though. Watch what happens when I introduce some into a sample --Before you go, I'd like to take a sample of your blood.Is he sick?You care about him, don't you?My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.Some. It's been slow --I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.Excuse me.You make it sound like I'm already dead.All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia?So what about gene therapy?Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia.On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure -- The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.What happened to the power?Why haven't you killed me yet?How many of you are there?What happens then?LaMagra --You.There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --But you use blood banks --You're a monster.Are you all right?I don't know. I woke up just before you did --Is it bad?It won't work on you.Your condition's congenital, the genetic mutations occurred in utero. All the other victims contracted vampirism after birth.I can't cure you, Blade. I can cure myself, but I can't cure you. I'm so sorry.Blade --Curtis?!Blade.I'm not leaving without you.I know. Take some of my blood.It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.Don't stop --My God --Are you -- all right?Get away from him!Blade!Blade?I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise -- It's over, isn't it?", "clean_line": "took doa isn human blood know look blood smear red blood cells biconvex theoretically impossible hypochromic virtually hemoglobin look pmns binucleated mononucleated curtis morning mood practical jokes thought promised distance minutes second want hear word haven started internal organs remember ass hole snapped reality shoulder dislocated sorry people joking help happens use stake honestly expect believe leave life career police blood samples hospital ridiculous powerful guys patch send way need police emergency hello karen jansen curtis webb mid town hospital night right witnessed attack aurora apartment yes ll wait hurry grip girl yes karen jansen know listen idea happened curtis doctor said work vampires know bait ve policeman god want work good thing human murder going kill supposed shut eyes pretend saw remembered address followed look true chance turn ve got choice work need learn way ll able cure know looking graffiti know place blood bank ve mistake let hour ago ready kill man talk tell believe real like place isn little high tech thought vampires cobwebs coffins moved ve listening time whistler hurt injecting aren tell truth happens serum offense whistler exactly working state art equipment missed hunt killed escape blade exact revenge ll chances blade dark whistler told mother aren real memories kind recall human bleed like ve seen vampire blood running veins blade trip hospital night borrowed equipment sodium citrate anti coagulant use treat blood clots vampire blood thinner humans watch happens introduce sample like sample blood sick care mother cold heart dead heart slow tired ve night excuse sound like dead right let start basics vampires need drink blood vampirism genetic defect like hemolytic anemia gene therapy basically write victim dna alter dna produce proteins capable generating hemoglobin retrovirus injected bone marrow cells causes host dna mutate ve treat sickle cell anemia yes blade sure problem blade contract vampire virus bite like born irony probably cure vampire happened power haven killed happens lamagra need condition treated whistler working cure use blood banks monster right know woke bad won work condition congenital genetic mutations occurred utero victims contracted vampirism birth cure blade cure cure sorry blade curtis blade leaving know blood way know ll alive yes human stronger know stop god right away blade blade imagined happy sun rise isn"}}}
