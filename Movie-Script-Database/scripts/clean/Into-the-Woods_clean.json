{"Into-the-Woods": {"BAKER": {"raw_line": "Once upon a time, in a far off kingdom, there lay a small village at the edge of the woods...And in this village...... lived a young maiden...... a care-free young lad...... and a childless baker...... with his Wife-- \"The poor girl's parents had died-- Her two daughters, also blonde, FLORINDA and LUCINDA, appear on the stairwell. They're junior versions of Mom.And now she lived with her stepmother......who had two daughters of her own. CINDERELLA rises and shyly retreats, but the STEPSISTERS sweep around her menacingly.All three were beautiful of face, but vile and black of heart.The young lad had no father, and hisWell, she was at her wit's end--And then there was a hungry little girl who always wore a red cape... The BAKER turns to see a small hand rise up and snatch one of the BUNS off the counter.Hey! The BAKER swiftly comes around the counter where a small, plump young girl in a red cape, LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD studies the goodies.I don't suppose you're planning on buying any of these? The WIFE gives the BAKER a look, then hands LRRH a basket.And you might save some of those sweets for Granny.Who might that be?Then what is it you wish?What are you talking about?I had a brother?Where is she?How could you do that to me?I'm so sorry...I'm not wearing that.It was my father's. You heard what she said. This is all his fault. The BAKER throws the jacket to the ground.I want nothing to do with him! The WIFE sees that BEANS have spilled out of the pocket.No. I can do this on my own.Now tell me. What am I to return with?Deep within the woods, Cinderella had planted a branch at the grave of her mother. And she visited there so often, and wept so much, that her tears watered it until it had become a magnificent tree. CINDERELLA kneels in prayer.On her path to Granny's, the little girl suddenly found herself in a very unusual part of the wood.You frightened me! The WITCH swings to the ground.How am I supposed to get it?I can't just take a cloak from a little girl. Why don't you take it!This is ridiculous! ANOTHER ANGLE. LRRH is picking flowers off the path, blithely unaware of anything else. The BAKER gets up and hurries over to her.Hello there little girl.Have you saved some of those sweets for Granny?So I see! Now tell me...where did you get that beautiful cape?Is that right? I would love a red cape like that.May I take a look at it? He quickly unties it.I need it badly.I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure that you really loved this cape. Now off you go to Granny's -- and be careful that no wolf comes your way.What are you doing here? The WIFE steps out from behind a thicket.You shouldn't be here. It's not safe in these woods!No! THE SPELL IS ON MY HOUSE--Hello there, young lad.What might you be doing with a cow in the middle of the forest?And what are you planning to do there?Five pounds!Huh?Magic that defies description.Six....possibly. Here. He hands JACK the five beans, carefully dropping them one at a time into the boy's hand. The WIFE quickly takes the SIXTH BEAN and puts it in her pocket.Good luck there, young lad. As the BAKER takes the cow's leash, JACK wraps his arms around the bony animal.Take the cow and go home!Magic beans! We've no reason to believe they're magic! Are we going to dispel this curse through deceit?Five beans?!Of course. But...I'm just not sure I'm cut out to be a father.Because of my father.I don't know...All right. You take the cow and go home. I'll find the rest of the things. On my own. The BAKER walks away.The old enchantress had given the name Rapunzel to the child she had hidden away and locked in a a doorless tower. But little did she know that the girl's lilting voice had caught the attention of a handsome Prince.\"As the little girl approached her Granny's oak tree, she was surprised to see the door standing open.And with a single bound, the wolf had devoured the little girl. Well, it was a full day of eating for both.I can't believe I just did that. LRRH and GRANNY appear at the doorway behind him.No thanks!I'm a baker.You need to be more careful, young lady.Are you certain?Thank you. Thank you! Impulsively he gives her a kiss on the cheek and as he leaves, the girl wipes it off.The first night of the festival ball brought Cinderella her wish. The Prince danced only with her, `til he turned and she had slipped away. Suddenly CINDERELLA in her ball-gown rushes out of a back entrance and onto the terrace disappearing around a corner.A giant?Wait a minute! I'm not sure I want to sell.No, no, no! It's not that--Wait. I didn't say-- But JACK doesn't wait to listen. Taking the EMPTY SACK, he runs off excitedly.Hey, come back!What are you doing here?Yes. I've got the cape. Only two items left.Two. We've the cape and the cow.What have you done with the cow?!But she didn't!We were just going to do that. Here. He climbs towards her with the cape.You can have this--I don't like that woman.I shouldn't have yelled. Go back to the village. I will make things right. And then we can just go about our life. No more witches or dim- witted boys or hungry little girls. The BAKER'S WIFE starts to speak.GO!, please -- go. She goes.As the Baker's Wife bolted from the tower, the second night of the festival was thrown into chaos when Cinderella once again ran from the Prince. While the BAKER'S WIFE continues to run away from Rapunzel's tower, in the distance she sees a flutter of gold moving through the moonlit trees. CINDERELLA? She changes course in pursuit. SERIES OF SHOTS with MUSIC CLOSE-UP on CINDERELLA'S SHOES as they make their way through wooded path. ANGLE ON THE WIFE as she races towards them in pursuit. The WIFE catches up with CINDERELLA and tackles her to the ground, CINDERELLA'S slipper falling off. They both dive for the slipper, when an approaching noise catches the WIFE'S attention.Moo... Moo...... He HEARS sounds off in the distance.Please, if you would be so kind, may I compare this ear of corn with your hair? The STEPSISTERS scream.Milky-White! He hears something and hides behind a BUSH. Then, seeing it is his WIFE, he steps out.I thought you were returning home! The WIFE screams in fright. Then she recognizes him.Two.Where did you find it?Three!We've one entire day left. Surely we can locate the slipper by then.Well...perhaps it will take the two of us to have this child.Where did you get this?No, no, no - it's not how it sounds!When dawn broke, the Baker and his Wife had but one day left to reverse the Witch's curse. As for Rapunzel's Prince, he returned yet again to the forbidden tower.Jack took the little girl's dare and before he knew it, found himself fleeing from a Giant. Suddenly, the BEANSTALK shakes mightily, making JACK hold on for dear life. He looks up to discover the Giant climbing down after him; Jack feverishly picks up speed and jumps the last six feet to the ground. He quickly drops the harp and runs to a large axe embedded in the stump of a tree. JACK swings the AXE striking the BEANSTALK.We've only one day left! I don't know where to start.Right, where do I buy a cow?What are you going to do?The yellow slipper?Yes. The golden slipper, that's what I meant. How are you going to get it?You think you could get one?Right.The entire kingdom shook when the beanstalk came crashing down, killing the Giant......as for Cinderella, she fled from the Prince... again. ANOTHER ANGLE. Suddenly, when CINDERELLA is MID-FLIGHT on the steps, she falters, unable to move. She looks down to see that there is TAR on this step and her shoes are stuck. ANGLE ON THE PRINCE. Smiling as he sees he has finally trapped his prey. We FREEZE the action as CINDERELLA considers the situation.And in her haste, the Baker's Wife took no notice of a second beanstalk climbing skyward.As the Prince anxiously waited, the Stepmother took matters -- and Florinda's foot -- into her own hands.Minus one toe, Florinda mounted the Prince's horse, unaware of the blood dripping from the slipper. As the STEWARD steps back, he notices a tiny speck of blood on his white glove. He looks up to the PRINCE to show him his hand. The PRINCE looks back to FLORINDA who shrugs sheepishly.Lucinda was next.Minus a heel, Lucinda did her best to swallow the pain. At last, LUCINDA appears, masking her pain with a smile, and limps towards the PRINCE. She is followed by her MOTHER andAs punishment for their cruelty, Cinderella's birds swooped down upon the Stepsisters... and blinded them. The BIRDS enter the picture frame, more and more, their CAWING rising to a crescendo until their flapping wings are all we see.As for Rapunzel, the Witch had banished her to a swamp in the darkest depths of the forest. ANOTHER ANGLE. The R-PRINCE with a ragged scarf wrapped around his now blinded eyes, sits slumped over on his horse as the animal navigates its way through the marshy expanse. The R-PRINCE lifts his head as he hears RAPUNZEL'S singing.Come on! We don't have any time... Then the WIFE rushes in from another direction, carrying theYou've got the slipper!And the cape as red as blood.We've done it!We had a cow as white as milk. Honestly we did.And we thought you'd prefer a live cow.It's here...She's going to bring Milky-White back to life.She's a witch! She can do anything!It's almost midnight!And four, I compared the hair with this ear of corn.What? JACK grabs the ear of corn out of the BAKER'S hand.That was quick! The cloud that has surrounded the WITCH now engulfs the area until a brisk wind blows it away, revealing a beautiful woman standing in the BLUE LIGHT of the FULL MOON. The WITCH has been restored to her former self, and she likes what she sees. The final CHIME OF MIDNIGHT is joined by every other BELL IN THE KINGDOM -- a joyous cacophony as we:And it came to pass, all that seemed wrong was now right. The Witch succeeded in reversing her mother's curse. Cinderella finally stopped running from her Prince. CINDERELLA'S POV on the crowd. She sees JACK and his MOTHER waving; JACK'S MOTHER is over- dressed in brand new clothes including a ridiculous \"fascinator\" hat.Jack was reunited with his beloved cow and his mother could now dress in the best a golden egg could buy. Cinderella now sees the BAKER and his WIFE standing amongst the crowd, the WIFE holding their new BABY BOY.And the Baker and his Wife were proud parents of a strapping baby boy. The WIFE shows her the BABY.And so with the kingdom filled with joy, those who deserved to were destined to live happily ever...And the baby?But as they made their way back into the woods, their familiar paths were nowhere to be found and their lives were about to take an unexpected turn.Hello, little one. Are you alright? What are you doing here? With a suitcase?What do you mean?We can help you find Granny's without the path.Why does he always cry when I hold him?He doesn't want me. He wants his mother!I'll take care of him -- when he's older... They hear COMMOTION in the distance.It's the Steward and the royal family.What brings you into the woods?What is the Royal family going to do?A giant woman! Through the trees we see the furious face of a female GIANT. We never see her in her entirety -- but the volume of her voice matches her size.We haven't seen him. The WITCH, who has slipped in behind the group, comes forward startling everyone and moves directly to the GIANT.Don't upset the Giant!Listen everyone. If we're going to get through this we have to stick together.Okay, I promise.We're never going to find him.No. You can't be on your own.What if we get lost?You would leave our son with her?But what if the Giant comes back...Wait! Take this. It might be cold.Four eighty two... four eighty three...Earthquake? It's no earthquake -- there's a giant terrorizing the kingdom!Hah, the Prince? No doubt he's off somewhere seducing some young maiden.You look just like the Princess -- but dirty. Oh no, you are the Princess! He drops to his knees and bows.I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you.If you'd like you can come with me. You will be safe in our company. CINDERELLA thinks for a moment, then nods.This way.She should be back by now.No, I must go and look for her-- They hear a commotion. It's the WITCH, who has JACK by the scruff of the neck.Let go of him!(at the top of hisWhere did you find this? The WITCH releases JACK.It's my wife's!What are you saying? JACK can't say the words.No. No...! As the truth sinks in.This is my fault. I let her wander off alone. I should have made her stay with me.Yes! He's the one to blame! It's because of you there's a giant in our midst and my wife is dead!Away from here.It doesn't matter whether we're together or apart.You don't understand. My wife was the one who helped. I depended on her for everything.What are you doing here?I don't want to talk to you. It's because of you all of this happened. Go away!Why would you do that? Why did you take the Witch's beans?-- Selfish.You stole them and you were caught, and then you did what you do. You just ran away.... and your son.If you're looking for forgiveness, you're not going to get it.Then what do you want?Give me my son. The BAKER takes the BABY. The baby begins to cry.(pulling the baby close to comfortWe need to rid this kingdom of the Giant -- together.She'll be back soon; here's the plan. We're going to feed Jack to the Giant.We're going to use you as bait to lure the Giant towards the tar pit. Suddenly a swarm of BIRDS appears overhead.Okay, we don't have much time.Here's what we're going to do... The BAKER leads them away from the tar pit.Careful, there. Not so fast.Jack, there's something you have to know. Your mother...She didn't make it.No. It wasn't like that. She was fighting with the Giant, trying to protect you, and she was pushed by the Steward -- and -- she fell.No, Jack --You'll do nothing of the kind.It's not as easy as that.Go, Jack! Be careful.Ready?Jack, Jack!Jack, I'm here. CINDERELLA helps JACK lift the tree branch as the BAKER, breathless, crawls out from beneath its grasp. He is scratched up, but relieved. CINDERELLA takes the BABY fromAre you okay? Are you alright? We did it! We did it! Come here. They embrace the BAKER. There's a moment of realization of what just happened as they look up at the roots of the fallen tree.Now we can all return home.-- of course you can come home with me.If you want to.Here -- give him to me. The BAKER walks away from the group, trying to settle his SON. He wraps his SCARF around the BABY.Hey, hey, hey, come on now. Hey, please, come on, come on, it's okay. I know you miss your mother. The BAKER sits on a fallen tree trunk.I miss her too. The BABY cries.Sssh! The BABY still cries.Shhhh. As the Baker holds his son close, the baby begins to calm down for the first time in his father's arms and his WIFE disappears. The BAKER tells the story to his son -- THE SAME STORY AS WE", "clean_line": "time far kingdom lay small village edge woods village lived young maiden care free young lad childless baker wife poor

{"raw_line": "I thought if he was nice and warm he might produce some milk.Bullseye! JACK'S MOTHER was just exiting the house. The CUP falls down, narrowly missing her.Mother, no-- he's the best cow in theBut Milky-White is my best friend!Why do I have to go to the next village?But that's cheating.No more than five pounds. She grabs his ear and squeezes it hard.Hello, sir.I was heading toward market -- but I seem to have lost my way.Sell my cow, sir. No less than five pounds.I hadn't thought of that...Beans in exchange for my cow?Magic? What kind of magic?How many beans?Could I buy my cow back someday?One day, I'll buy you back -- Promise! JACK kisses the cow. The BAKER looks to his WIFE guiltily. Overcome with emotion, JACK runs back into the woods.But they're magic -- the man said --Mother -- no! She turns to grab JACK'S ear, failing to see the electric sparks that flare when the beans strike the ground.Good fortune! Good fortune, sir! Look what I have! Five gold pieces.So, here's your money, sir! Five gold pieces. Where is my Milky-White?Let's go find them! JACK grabs the BAKER and excitedly tries to pull him along.But you said I could buy her back. Do you want more money?Stop it! Stop my egg! The BAKER stops the egg and picks it up. JACK stumbles down the hill.Oh, brilliant! My Milky-White. And the owners. And my egg!From the Giant's hen! The BAKER'S WIFE examines the egg.And you can have it. Along with the five gold pieces.Now I'm taking my cow. JACK moves to MILKY-WHITE. The distant CHIMES OF MIDNIGHT begin to ring out from the castle.You said I could have my cow!Hey there - nice cape! The figure twists around, pulling a knife.Whoa! I don't want it.Well, look what I have! A golden egg. He shows her his GOLDEN EGG.I stole a hen that lays golden eggs from the kingdom of the Giant.It's true. And you should see the Giant's toy harp. It plays the most beautiful tunes without your even having to touch it.I could.I could!I am not a liar! I'll get that harp. You'll see! He runs off.There is?But Mother, look. The most beautiful harp.What's happening?Wow!Milky-White. You're back! I missed you so much! The BAKER looks up at the MOON...only a slither left, the rest covered by SHADOW.I'll do it. She'll only milk for me. JACK begins milking the cow, the others watching intently, but alas, nothing is coming out.Squeeze, pal! You can do it.The corn! The corn!You can use the silky hair of the corn--She's milking! The WITCH grabs the chalice.You're hurting me! The WITCH continues pulling the boy along.Make her stop!I'm sorry, sir...I'm sorry. I came upon her. She was at the bottom of a cliff...Maybe I shouldn't have stolen from the Giant...Where are you going?We need your help.If there were just some way we could surprise the Giant.He wouldn't leave his baby.I'm excited.You needn't worry -- this is easier than a beanstalk. ANGLE ON CINDERELLA. She's sitting on a tree stump, rocking the baby. LRRH returns.Wait until my mother hears I've slain the Giant.What?Was she killed by the Giant?The Steward will pay for this.After we slay the Giant, I will slay him.What he done was wrong. He should be punished.Here I am! The GIANT begins to move aggressively towards JACK. JACK and the BAKER load their slings.Ready! ANGLE on the GIANT'S feet, trampling everything in her path.

And if we fail...Why do you say that?You're not him.If you can't do this for yourself, can't you at least do it for me?Are you alright, miss?What a beautiful gown you're wearing. Were you at the King's Festival? CINDERELLA, preoccupied, collects herself so she can continue on her way.Aren't you the lucky one. Why ever are you in the woods at this hour? We hear the PRINCE'S ENTOURAGE approaching.(Breathless as sheI've never lied to royalty before. I've never anything to royalty before!If a prince were looking for me, I certainly wouldn't hide.Oh, my husband's somewhere in the woods.Oh, yes.

What I wouldn't give to be in your shoes. (looking to herWait! I need your shoes! The WIFE goes after CINDERELLA but then hears a distant COW MOAN. She turns around to discover that MILKY-WHITE has taken off.Milky-White! The WITCH appears from nowhere.Already?!Well... She doesn't want to tell him she's lost MILKY-WHITE.I see you've got the red cape!She ran away. I never reached home. I've been looking for her all night.She might just as easily have run from you!I'm sorry I lost the cow.Rapunzel, Rapunzel? Let your hair down to me. The window at the top of the tower opens and RAPUNZEL sticks out her head looking downward. The WIFE hides to the side.(in her best princelyExcuse me for this. She takes a fist full of hair and gives it a pull. Nothing. She tries once again, this time with more force eliciting a little yelp from RAPUNZEL. Finally, she holds on to the hair and just starts running away from the tower as fast as she can. We hear RAPUNZEL yell as the WIFE succeeds in pulling some of the hair from her head.I was trying to hold her here for you...Yes, of course. The STEWARD returns, covered in burrs and looking none too happy.Oh! It's you! And you've the cow! She runs to MILKY-WHITE.Three.Three! She shows him the braid of hair around her neck.Compare this to your corn. He does and it's a perfect match.And I almost had the fourth, but she got away.We? You mean you're going to let me stay with you?A golden egg! I've never seen a golden egg.Five gold pieces?Where are the five gold pieces?You can start by buying a new cow with the money you took from the boy.You go to the next village, you'll find a cow there.I'm going to get the slipper.The GOLDEN slipper!I have met a maiden with golden slippers these two previous nights.Yes, I'm sure of it. I'll meet you back here.Because we have to if we're going to be together... The BAKER and his WIFE start to go off in opposite directions when there is a TREMENDOUS CRASH with the force of an earthquake. The BAKER and his WIFE are knocked off their feet and tumble into a bank of FERNS. They scramble to their feet and look to one another.What is happening?Please, stop! Just hear me out!I didn't attack you. I attacked your shoe. I need it. I have a magic bean in exchange for it. Breathless, CINDERELLA stops. Stands defensively. The WIFE pulls out the bean from her pocket and hands it to her.Wait, please. I haven't much time!Does it make sense that you're running from a prince? The STEWARD approaches on HORSEBACK.(starts to take off aThank you! Thank you! CINDERELLA dashes off.It's mine.Please give me the slipper, kind Prince, and all will come to a happy end.Thank you. Thank you!I've found you! You've got the cow!We've all four! They hug with delight but are quickly startled by the WITCH who appears in the hollow of a tree.And the hair as yellow as corn.We've got them all. But suddenly the WITCH is suspicious.Of course she is. A desperate glance at the BAKER. He couldn't have screwed this up -- could he?She has to be! The WITCH walks over and smacks the animal. Flour puffs off its back.What? You didn't get a real white cow? The BAKER turns to the WITCH.She's dead.We're running out of time!What?Wait! We followed your instructions. One, the cow is as white as milk. Correct?And two, the cape was certainly as red as blood.And three, the slipper--I pulled it from a maiden in a towerWell, nothing. I happened to beIt's working!Thanks for the slipper. The carriage arrives at the entrance to the castle. As the PRINCE and CINDERELLA step from their carriage they are met by cheers. The STEPFAMILY awaits the married couple. The beaming STEPMOTHER with her DAUGHTERS who are now wearing dark glasses, holding canes and looking rather glum. RAPUNZEL stands with her PRINCE. The CROWD ROARS as CINDERELLA and her PRINCE wave. The STEWARD takes up a large speaking trumpet and the CROWD quiets.I think so.Yes, he's fine. There is another AFTERSHOCK. ANGLE ON RAPUNZEL. She is spooked by the commotion and runs off through the crowd and disappears.What's happened? Everything's so different. They discover LRRH sitting on her suitcase in what was once a lush area, now trampled and broken.Calm down.Yes. The WIFE is exhausted. She hands the BABY to the BAKER.Please take him for a few moments. The BAKER is clearly uncomfortable holding the BABY. They continue walking. The BABY begins to cry.You needn't hold him as if he was so fragile. The BABY wails. The BAKER hands the bundle back.I can't take care of him all of the time.Who might that be?No!I think it best we get back to the village. We'll take the girl with us. She holds out a hand for LRRH.You come with us. LRRH takes her hand. But then the ground begins to shake. A frightening and increasingly loud crunching noise. They fight for their footing. The STEPFAMILY drop their belongings and rush to each other. The BAKER puts his arm around his WIFE. Everyone's faces fill with terror as a huge shadow engulfs them.It's a giant!Look! What have you done to her?We should fan out. It'll increase our chances.I'll be all right.We'll count our steps from right here.No. You stay with the baby. The WIFE hands LRRH the baby and sits her down.Yes. He's asleep. He'll be safe with the girl.See?What if, what if! Five hundred paces. Go! The WIFE turns and starts walking.One, two... The BAKER stops her. He unties his SCARF.One eighty-one...one eighty-two... one eighty-three... one eighty-four... (looks up; startled;You must be here to slay the Giant.Yes. Surely you've heard there is a giant in our midst.Yes, it's a lady giant. Unusual, huh?I came with my husband.

It's what you wish. She moves towards the WIFE as the BAKER tries unsuccessfully to protect her. She points her gross finger towards her belly.Nothing cooking in that belly now, is there? And there will never be... She looks away.Unless you do exactly as I say. In three days' time, a Blue Moon will appear. Only then can the curse be undone.The one I placed on this house!In the past, when you were no more than a babe, your father brought his young wife and you to this cottage. They were a lovely couple. But not lovely neighbors. You see, your mother was with child and she developed an unusual appetite. She admired my beautiful garden and she told your father that what she wanted, more than anything in the world was--No. But you had a sister.She's mine now and you'll never find her! Small price to pay for what else your father stole from me. It cost me my youth, my beauty. My mother warned me she would punish me with the curse of ugliness if I ever lost them.And when your mother died, your father deserted you. Your father was no father -- so why should you be?Why are you standing there?! Go get the cape!Get it! Get it! Get it!You go up to the little thing, and you take it.It's the rules. Why do you think I asked you in the first place? I'm not allowed to touch any of the objects! We suddenly hear the lilting sound of a young voice singing in the distance. The WITCH, almost intoxicated by her sound, swoons with delight. Then:Rapunzel. Rapunzel. Let down your hair to me. The PRINCE, hiding within the brush.Don't you look lovely today, my dear.I brought your favorite. Blackberries, fresh from the garden.One midnight gone!Get that cow! The WIFE takes off after the cow as the CAMERA RISES above tree level. The BLUE SHADOW has moved a little further across the face of the MOON.I gave you protection and yet you disobeyed me.Your prince will never lay eyes on you again. He will never lay eyes on anything again!It doesn't matter because where you're going, no one will ever see you again. The WITCH lunges at RAPUNZEL with a pair of SHEARS and begins to hack off her hair. The girl lets out a mighty shriek.I see a cow. I see a slipper.Wait a minute!This cow has been covered with flour!Then where is she?Of course I'd prefer a live cow! So show me the dead cow and I'll bring her back to life!Stand back! They quickly move away, and the WITCH invokes some unintelligible incantation, and with the wave of her cape, the DEAD COW comes back to life, shaking off the leaves. JACK races over to her.Quiet! Feed the objects to the cow.You heard me! Feed them to the cow! The WIFE and BAKER walk towards the COW and begin feeding it a portion of the ingredients. Not an easy chew for the animal. The WITCH hands them a silver chalice.Fill this!Wrong ingredients. Forget about a child!Yes.Yes.Yes.You what?! What were you doing there?I touched that hair! I told you! I cannot have touched the ingredients!Yes! Pull it from the ear and feed it to the cow. Quickly! The BAKER grabs the ear of corn from JACK, pulls the hair from the corn and feeds it to the cow. JACK begins milking the cow again. We hear the distant CHIMES OF MIDNIGHT begin. Light pours from above bathing them in a growing haze of BLUE LIGHT as the SHADOW finally eclipses the MOON. The COW lets out a BLOODCURDLING MOAN.At last! The WITCH drinks the potion. She begins to shake. Blue smoke begins to pour from her and swirl about as if she is trapped inside a cloud. The WIFE lets out a shriek.. The BAKER looks at his WIFE, her belly begins to grow to nine- months-full of pregnancy.We'll get him for you right away. Don't move! LRRH races past the WITCH and brandishes her knife.Would you like a blind girl instead?Not always. The STEPFAMILY leaves.I don't know where they think they're going. The giant's already destroyed the entire village. Only thing left of my garden are these beans.We have no choice. Find the boy and give her what she wants.And if we don't she'll kill half the kingdom! She rushes back into the woods.Rapunzel! You're safe! Thank goodness.Surely you remember?This is who I truly am, my dear. Now you don't have to be embarrassed by me. You must come with me. There's a Giant in the land. She moves towards RAPUNZEL -- but suddenly the R-PRINCE rides up on his white steed. He jumps off and rushes to RAPUNZEL.She's not going with you!Then you leave me no choice. The WITCH pulls RAPUNZEL behind her and tries to cast a spell on R'S PRINCE. Nothing. She tries again. Still nothing. The PRINCE takes notice of the Witch.I was just trying to be a good mother!Rapunzel, no! You will never be safe with him.No! Rapunzel!Look who I found!I'll let go of him when I give him to the Giant.Wake up! When you're dead, you're dead. Now it's time to get this boy to the Giant before we're all-- CINDERELLA and LRRH block her way.This is no time to be soft-hearted! He's going to the Giant and I'm taking him.

Surely you can let me be there for one of them.Thank you, Mother. She dashes into the woods.Yes.Please. Don't let them know I'm here. She quickly hides herself in the brush. The WIFE turns around and looks to the top of the rise to see C-PRINCE on a black stallion, with his STEWARD and ATTENDANTS in tow. He calls down to the WIFE.Thank you.Well, what brings you here -- and with a cow?It's not quite what I expected.I have no experience with those things. We hear the far off CHIMES OF MIDNIGHT from the castle.Yes... No... I don't know...I must get home. CINDERELLA runs off.Don't come any closer to me!You have attacked me once before.Magic bean? Nonsense! CINDERELLA tosses it over her shoulder, but they don't see the SPARKS it sets off when it hits the ground and sinks into the earth. She starts to leave.That makes no sense!I must go!The tree has fallen. Mother's grave, destroyed.I shouldn't complain. I'm sure others have suffered worse after the earthquake.Well, I'm sure the Prince will see to it that the Giant is rid from our land.What?Please. Please... Get up! I'm not a princess here.I had to disguise myself. I'm not permitted to leave the palace unescorted. CINDERELLA looks away towards the wreckage of her mother's grave.Thank you.I'm sure she'll return.How awful...Keep away from him.Maybe I shouldn't have attended the Ball...You would leave your child?But wait...I knew you wouldn't give up.The birds can help!That doesn't matter now! What's important is that we find a way to defeat the Giant.The birds will do their part.Your father's being very brave. We're going to be very brave too. The C-PRINCE is passing a nearby path on horseback. He stops when he sees CINDERELLA.The Giant went in that direction. He rides closer.I'm well aware of that. He comes and puts his arm around her, but she pulls away.Maybe I'm not your only love.If you love me, why did you stray?If this is how you behave as a prince, what kind of king will you be?I think you should go.Consider that I've been lost. A victim of the Giant.My father's house was a nightmare. Your house was a dream. Now I want something in-between. She takes off her wedding ring and gives it back to him. He stands there for a moment, then mounts his horse.And I the faraway prince. The PRINCE rides off.I'm glad you're here to help me. LRRH turns her head away.What's wrong?Why?Not somebody. A giant who's done a lot of harm.I know.Good birds!Where are they?Jack?Oh, be careful, are you alright?He's not with you?Let me take him.I'll gladly help you with your house.
