{"Three-Musketeers-The": {"D'ARTAGNAN": {"raw_line": "Had enough?Thank you, sir.Mother...?Did you see us? You heard us, I'll bet. Girard finally surrendered a compliment... though I almost had to kill him to get it... Mother...? D'Artagnan comes upon an open door, a small room beyond. He pauses, then steps inside.Didn't you hear me? Girard --Father's sword.And now to me.I will.I won't.Never.Mother. Maybe I should wait. Until after harvest. D'Artganan's mother smiles, understands. And speaks gently to urge him forward.Yes. But what am I running from?Horsemanship. Got it. D'Artagnan digs his heels into the horse's flanks, shoots off across bright green fields. His Mother shields her eyes from the sun, feels a gathering of tears, and watches him ride into the distance.I've saved you and your friend from these bandits.The Queen?I didn't know. I thought...D'Artagnan.Wait! You didn't tell me your name! But Constance is gone. D'Artagnan stands in the middle of the road, feeling foolish and oddly thrilled at the same time. The two bodyguards groan and grumble.The man who attacked you... ... went that way. With a guilty smile, d'Artagnan spurs his horse and rides like Hell.Look out!Where are they? Where are the Musketeers? I'm in the right place, aren't I?But this is Musketeer Headquarters...You mean it's been moved?What do you mean 'disbanded'?But I just got here. How can I become a Musketeer if they've been disbanded?Any time.I'll be there ten minutes early.An hour in Paris, and I already have my first duel! Just then, d'Artangnan spies two familiar figures on horseback, distinctive cloaks hiding their faces. Anne and Constance, though he does not yet know their names. D'Artagnan hurries after. CUT TO:No.There is no Queen of America.I rode through a puddle, muddied your sash, the Queen of America except there isn't one, I'm in a hurry, and you were about to challenge me to a duel.That seems to be the local custom. Porthos lets out a weary sigh. He shakes his head.The great who?The world's greatest talker?Bring your own!Let me pass.I must speak to those young women.I have something that belongs to the Queen.A bracelet.No, you've been enough help already. Would you be so kind as to point out the Carmes-Deshaux Monastery? The Guard points to a large building in the distance with a large cross. CUT TO:Get off me! D'Artagnan pushes Aramis aside. Aramis grabs d'Artagnan by the scruff of his neck and pulls him back.You fell on me!I suppose you'd like to teach me a lesson in manners, too.How's two o'clock behind the Luxembourg? Aramis bows politely.Three duels in one day. I love this town.I have another appointment at one.I'll try my best to be on time.But you're wounded.If you'd rather kill me another time...Excuse me, monsieur. But not until one o'clock.Yes, sir. But not until two.I arrived this morning.I've also fallen in love.Excuse me, but there are four of us.I may not wear the uniform, but I believe I have the heart of a Musketeer. The three Musketters exchange smiles. D'Artagnan's youthful bravado manages a small dent in their cynicism.D'Artagnan.Pleased to meet you... How do you do?... Good to see you again... Meanwhile, Jussac and his Guards look on with increasing impatience. He clears his throat, draws his saber. The Musketeers turn toward the Guards, d'Artagnan standing among them.What's he doing?The Queen of America?I can't leave. I just got here.Why can't I stay with you? Aramis and Porthos look to Athos. As always, he will decide.Whatever happened to the motto of the Musketeers? 'All for one, and one for all.'Long live the Musketeers. And d'Artagnan draws his saber.Thank you.My sword --It belonged to my father.I'm not dead yet. D'Artagnan starts forward. But Rochefort raises the sword, points it at his throat. D'Artagnan freezes, feels the sharp tip of the blade.Where am I?The Bastille! I'm in the Bastille!What do you mean?He interrupted a duel I was fighting.It was a long day.Who?How?Give me my father's sword, and I'll cut out your heart. Bold words, bad timing. Rochefort snarls, slams the hilt of the sword into d'Artagnan's head. The youth slumps from the wooden stool to the floor, unconscious.I can explain that --Not a word, Your Eminence. I stepped from my cell for a breath of air, and became lost in the corridors, it's dark as you know, but then I saw a light up ahead, the light over your door, I...D'Artagnan.Yes, Your Eminence.I came to join the King's Musketeers.So I've heard.I'm honored, Your Eminence, but I don't think I would be very popular with the other men. Not after today.You, Your Eminence?I'm sorry. But I can't tell you what I do not know.What about my trial?Wait --Yes. I like it where it is.I don't know.I wouldn't tell you.But...?They're firing at us!The next right...?But the Guards.I haven't eaten in three days. I guess with all the excitement, I forgot.Three days.He was my father.He died when I was nine. The mention of the elder d'Artagnan's death casts a pall. D'Artagnan continues, tentative, the memory still hurts.All my mother would tell me is that he died in the service of the King.This other Musketeer -- is he still alive? I'd like to talk to him. Athos shakes his head. Porthos adds:I imagined his death a hundred time.On a battlefield, defending his King. Fighting bravely for France. And now... I will find the man who murdered my father and kill him where he stands.But you never knew him...And your father?You didn't have one.You were a priest...And you became a Musketeer.But who was that man...... I couldn't hear it clearly, I was standing by the door, the voices were low --The Cardinal sent someone to England. With a secret treaty.He's made an alliance with a man named, Bucking... Buckingham. The Musketeers look at each other with alarm.Do you know him?What are we waiting for, let's go.Yes.Four. Bold words. D'Artagnan matures by leaps and bounds. Athos almost smiles.He needs our help.Weak... weak. Comical... clown.'Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou are move lovely and more tempest, er, more tempered...' Ahh, to hell with it --Why is he sitting by himself?Come join us. Athos pulls d'Artagnan down with a dark smile. He fills his flagon for him.I'll drink anything you put in front of me.Love?Yes. Athos takes a long pull from the bottle of burgundy, wipes the blood red wine from his lips.Isn't that what people do when they fall in love?What?He loved her.Were we making too much noise?My head feels like it's filled with the King's marching band. Would you please stop whistling?Well someone is.I'm beginning to wish the Cardinal had chopped if off.Do you think we've lost them?My father used to hunt in a forest like this. He promised to take me on my tenth birthday. I don't know why he picked that year. Something about a boy becoming a man. I'd lay in bed at night and imagine it, just the two of us. But he died before I could go with him. Athos is unmoved, or so it would seem. He replies with quiet cynicism:I'd be proud to die for my King.I can't leave you here. Not like this.Athos... I can't.A duel then.We never finished the first.But...? Athos reloads, FIRES below. D'Artagnan recognizes the kindness he has received. That Athos cannot fully express it. And that there is no use arguing with him.At least take my pistol.I'll never forget you.He rides, straining to hear the sounds of GUNFIRE. As long as the SHOTS continue, he knows Athos is alive. Abruptly... the SHOTS CEASE. D'Artagnan swallows his heart, and rides.You.I... saw you in Paris. D'Artagnan notices that his shoulder has been bandaged. He looks around the large room. A FIRE ROARS in the grate. Food and drink have been set upon a table. D'Artagnan continues, still groggy, uncertain:Where am I...?Calais! The ship... Tuesday at midnight... D'Artagnan leaps out of bed. Then realizes he is stark naked. Milady smiles. D'Artagnan gathers a bedsheet around him.Where are my clothes?What day is it? What time?!Nine? Are you sure?How did I... get here?My name is d'Artagnan.Countess?I'm sorry.Countess, I'm very grateful for what you've done, but I can't stay here. I've got...Important business.No.Yes. I need my clothes.An hour?I am... thirsty. Milady pours wine into glasses, turns to face him. And offers a smile that dazzles and burns.I was thinking about my friends. Milady knows when to speak, and when to listen. She looks at d'Artagnan with gentle expression, allows him to continue. The warm room, the wine, her kindness. All conspire to loosen his tongue. D'Artagnan speaks quietly, from the heart:The three best friends a man could have. We were separated on our way to Calais. I'm afraid I'll never see them again.I'd like to tell you. But I can't.All I can tell you is... I'm on a mission for the King.I'm serious.I came to Calais to stop a spy from sailing to England.Yes.Musketeers are not afraid of anything.You did?A Musketeer is not afriad of danger.You're not dangerous.You're... beautiful.I'm sorry -- D'Artagnan pulls back -- just as Milady's arm arcs down toward his neck, holding a long sharp stick pin, almost a dagger, attached to an ivory comb. D'Artagnan sees it in the nick of time, parries with his free hand, knocking the dagger to the rug. Milady leaps after it, hands out- stretched. D'Artagnan follows, battles for the dagger, stunned with fear and surprise:What're you doing?! Have you lost your mind?!My God...You can kill me. But a surprise waits for you in England. That even Buckingham can't prevent.That's one thing I'll never tell you.The man at the inn... what did he want?Why?Did you murder your husband, Milady?I think he's not the first husband you killed. I once knew a man, one of the Counts of Berry. He told me a story... of beauty and danger. He was the bravest man I've ever known. And the saddest.My friends are dead.Two of them.I thought you were dead.What do you mean?Find the weakness. Take advantage. Got it. Aramis kneels at a dying man, delivers muttered last rites. A Bodyguard races INTO VIEW, means to kill him where he kneels. Aramis doesn't miss a beat -- he shifts, rises, delivers a punch and kick, knocking the man off the ship to the water below. A SPLASH is heard. And Aramis resumes a priestly pose, continues the litany. CUT TO:Porthos the Pirate?I love a good sea story. Do tell me sometime. Porthos reacts to d'Artagnan's jest. But before he can reply, the youth has bolted back to the fray.Yes.Athos. The spy... is a woman.A demonstration? What does that mean?But...?This sword belongs to me.What...?This is for you, Father.Take it back...?No!!Thank you, Your Eminence. I'll be watching you, too. Richelieu smiles his crocodile smile. Followed by guards, he turns and strides away, hands clasped behind his back, scarlet robes billowing behind him. Louis turns to the Musketeers. He indicates d'Artagnan.I have something that belongs to ... Your Majesty... D'Artagnan produces the bracelet he found on the country road. He holds it out to her. The King wonders, the Queen smiles.I know this is a stupid question. But what exactly does a Musketeer do?All for one...", "clean_line": "thank sir mother heard ll bet girard finally surrendered compliment kill mother artagnan comes open door small room pauses steps

"Have they all been accounted for?Three?I want those Musketeers, not excuses. Bring them in at once. CUT TO:How was your ride?Forgive me.But your welfare is more than a matter of personal interest. It is a matter of State. But rest assured, your secret is safe with me.You're homesick.Sometimes. Richelieu brings his eyes back to Anne, continues:Austria's loss is France's gain.Nonsense. He's young, not blind.Arranged marriages can be difficult. Your father and I thought yours would bring Austria and France closer together.May I advise you?Louis was only nine years old when his father was assassinated. He lost his childhood forever that day. I have watched him grow toward manhood, seen the toll his life demands. A boy who is not allowed to be a boy sometimes has difficulty becoming a man. He is shy, yet boastful. Giving, yet stubborn. But most of all, he is not yet sure exactly who he is. The boy who lost his father. Or the King of France.Flatter him. Make the boy feel like a King. So that the King may be your husband.Your Majesty.Perhaps if I knew the question...You approved the decision.Your Majesty, France is on the brink of war. We dare not hesitate.They are the bravest fighters in France.We'll need them in the field if we're to win this war with England. Buckingham plans to invade La Rochelle within the month. I thought it best to act quickly --Of course. Forgive me. A tense beat. Anne, feeling out of place, steps toward the door.Extremely.Very.May I advise you?She scares me too. As do all women who join beauty to intelligence. What's a man to do?The course of love is full of frightful turns. But, no matter how you feel, no matter how hopelessly afraid... never let her know that you are anything other than the bravest and most confident man in France. Make that your starting point, and everything else will fall... into place.Good advice for a shopkeeper. Let alone a King.I know. But don't worry.From now on, I'll take complete responsibility for your welfare. Indeed he will.That foolish boy is about to become a man. Which is all the more reason for us to act... quickly.She will receive me in ways she never thought possible. Privately. HOLD ON the Cardinal and Rochefort, watching the King and Queen below. CUT TO:I have an errand that requires your singular talents.Forget you? Impossible. Richelieu and Milady share a look of intimacy, two vipers from the same pit.Carry this to the Duke of Buckingham.The King left me no choice. Now that he's come of age, the boy believes he should rule France. Instead of me.Yes. Everything. You're to leave for Calais at once. A ship called the Persephone will carry you to England. It sails Tuesday, midnight. I want Buckingham's signature next to mine before the King's birthday. Friday.And doing so, shall earn you the gratitude of... a King.Rochefort. Violence solves nothing. Leave him to me. D'Artagnan reacts to the Cardinal's reasonable tone. Rochefort makes a sullen exit. The Cardinal smiles.Please. Sit down. D'Artagnan reacts with perceptible awe, as if seeing his first movie star. He sits in a finely brocaded chair, looks at the Cardinal, an apparition in red. The Cardinal speaks, his manner casual, friendly.How much did you hear?You may have many talents, my young friend. But guile is not one of them. Do you have a name?I've heard that name before. Are you a Gascon?Tell me. What brought you to Paris. And don't say 'a horse.'Bad timing.D'Artagnan, I like you. I could use a capable young man like you in my Guards.I suppose not. Your heart is set on being a Musketeer. When I was your age, I too had dreams of joining the Musketeers.Why not? Becoming a Musketeer is the fantasy of every young Frenchman. Or should I say it was... Like the Knights of the Round Table, the Musketeers have outlived their usefulness. They are a thing of the past. And so have your three friends. Tell me where they are, d'Artagnan, and I will spare your life.In that case, give my regards to the headsman.You've just had it.Why? Do you object to losing your head?Then tell me what I want to know, and perhaps you will keep it there a few years longer. Where are the three Musketeers?And if you did?I admire your courage, young man. You might have made a fine Musketeer after all.But we'll never know, will we? Rochefort steps into the room, grabs d'Artagnan roughly by the arm, hurls him from the chair to the floor. This time Richelieu does not utter protest. Instead, he turns to the Captain, commands:Find the three Musketeers and kill them.A comforting thought. Good night, d'Artagnan. Enjoy it. Morning comes quickly.A remarkable woman. The most beautiful I've ever known. And the deadliest. Which would explain my attraction. How is our young daredevil holding up?My carriage.One thousand pistoles on each of their heads, dead or alive. The boy knows our plans.Don't worry. Thanks to our winged friends, every mercenary and bounty hunter in France will be waiting for them. Isn't modern communication a wonderful thing?Your Majesty, forgive me.I need your help. And could not in good conscience wait another minute.Yes.Your... husband.I am worried about the King's... happiness.The Huguenot rebellion, occupation in the Antilles and Cayenne. The coming war with France. These are not the usual hobbies of youth.And now he wishes to postpone his birthday celebration.He feels it is not... appropriate.Which is exactly why we must celebrate. To show the world that the King of France is strong enough to face any enemy on any field. To show France... that he is King. He will listen to you. If you will speak. Richelieu makes his case with forceful eloquence, seeming loyalty. Anne considers, replies, noncommittal:Of course. Anne nods, turns back toward the chambers. Richelieu calls after.Your Majesty? Please understand that I do not underestimate the value of your assistance.And that I wish for you to consider -- in fact, to know -- all that you and I might accomplish. Together. For France. Richelieu steps away, his red cape swirling behind him. Anne feels a chill, pulls her robe more tightly about her body. CUT TO:I'm sorry to be late, Your Majesty, but I was wrestling with an important matter of state.I'm afraid... that's impossible.They have become outlaws. They are terrorizing the countryside, robbing and killing innocent people.No mistake. I have reports from the local constables involved.They are better off disbanded. Louis turns back to the balcony, the soldiers marching below. His mood glum and lonely. He sighs, moves on to another matter of business.There are so many to choose from. Is it the one about my alleged alliance with Buckingham? Let's see if I remember it correctly. While the English attack from without, I'll undermine the throne from within -- depose you -- and become sovereign of France myself. That rumor, Your Majesty?If there are any doubts of my loyalty, they'll be put to rest when we appear together at your birthday celebration.Your subjects are eager to celebrate the birth of their King at a time like this.I have an idea. Why don't you discuss the matter with your Queen? Louis looks up, wonders. As Richelieu draws him deeper into his spider's strategems.The wonderful thing about an imaginary opponent is that he is always greatly skilled, and always easily defeated. The pride of victory, without the risk of loss. If only life were like that.Milady has reached Calais.Buckingham's signature will be on the treaty by morning.Will proceed as planned. Thanks to the kind intercession of Queen Anne. Rochefort steps closer, speaks quietly.Will proceed as well. Richelieu pours two glasses of port, offers one to Rochefort. They turn, raise their glasses to the King's portrait. And drink. CUT TO:Impressive.And he has no qualms about...A man of faith. How delightful. Whatever you're paying him, double it. I want the King's birthday to be a memorable event. And rehang this painting in my chamber. Just as it is. HOLD ON Richelieu for a beat. Framed by a sky filled with stars. His evil intent. CUT TO:I'm not sure which is sadder... to die so young. Or to die a King. Richelieu turns from the procession. Speaks to Rochefort who pauses in the shadowy alcove behind him.France will not go wanting. A new King will sit on the throne. The true King after all...Is everything ready?Are you sure?Rest assured, Captain. You have.Your Majesty...Kill him. Kill her, too.Your Majesty, that document is an obvious forgery. I am clearly the victim of a conspiracy designed and perpetuated by these three Musketeers.You can't do this to me. I'm the Cardinal of France.Congratulations, Monsieur d'Artagnan.

Go away.The Cyclops is a Captain? He must've made a pact with the Devil.What's the difference?These gentlemen made a similar request.Probably. But I'll leave it up to my companions. Aramis?And what do you say, Porthos?Now. About those tunics... Jussac turns to watch Athos, Porthos, and Aramis step to the street. He mutters as if to curse:I was trying to remember the last time I saw you here. I know. It was the day you were kicked out of the Musketeers.It was the least we could do.And if we refuse?Do that, Rochefort. Tell his Emminence the Cardinal that we will continue to perform our sworn duty to protect the King. From enemies across the sea.From traitors who sit at his right hand. And tell him that he can take away our tunics, our muskets, even our swords. But he cannot stop us from being what we are. Musketeers.We'll meet at the Columbier-Rouge at sundown. To celebrate. And to plan our new lives.The three Musketeers. And that is all that remains.He crosses the courtyard to a large wooden door. But as he reaches for the handle, the door flies open and smacks him in his injured arm.Aaarrgghh...Not as far as I'm concerned.No. This was Musketeer Headquarters.I mean the Musketeers have been disbanded. Feel free to poke around for souvenirs.Some nonsense about being needed in the army. Now if you'll excuse me... D'Artagnan blocks Athos' path.I'd say you've got a problem. D'Artagnan grabs Athos by his injured arm. Athos, stif- ling pain, fixes d'Artagnan with a deadly look.You could use a lesson in manners. D'Artagnan touches his sword, eyes flashing at the pos- sibility of a duel.I'm in a hurry now -- but I'll meet you at the Carmes-Deshaux monastery at noon.Ten minutes early.You'll miss it, I'm afraid.I asked two of my friends to act as seconds, but they are not as punctual.Don't worry. I fight just as well with my left hand.Thanks, but I see my seconds coming now.Why not?How long have you been in Paris?You've been... busy.Better to die for love than to live for it. Gentlemen?I told you the next time we met I'd want an answer. But I didn't expect you so soon.This is not your fight. You're not a Musketeer.Have you got a name, boy?Athos... Porthos... Aramis.The Cardinal's Guards.You mean he's still alive?Last rites. Aramis takes death very seriously.Not if he leaves Paris. Which is exactly what he's going to do.Because I do not want you to. It's hard to say whether he's acting out of concern for the boy... or he simply doesn't give a damn. Whatever the case, d'Artagnan is crestfallen. The Musketeers mount their horses, Porthos and Aramis adopt a friendlier tone.Wake up, boy. The Musketeers are just a dream.Too bad.Gentlemen, your carriage. Compliments of the Cardinal.Hold on!You know I prefer wine.Turn right at the next street.Turn. Athos growls, d'Artagnan jerks at the reins. The carriage careens around the corner, tipping on two wheels.Gentlemen, this is the end of the line. I hope you had a pleasant ride. Unhitch the horses.Do as I say. D'Artagnan hurries to the horses. Porthos and Aramis climb from the cab. Porthos emits a contented belch.Your pistol and powder, please. Aramis hands Athos a sack of powder, and his pistol. Athos tosses the sack into the carriage, takes aim with the PISTOL, and SHOOTS it -- igniting the powder inside.Stand back.D'Artagnan, your father and another Musketeer were ambushed and murdered outside the Louvre. D'Artagnan pales, stunned and silent. He manages a broken whisper:Wait.Does the Cardinal know you have this information?Then he knows we have it too. And he'll do everything in his power to stop us.Stay on your horse.Don't worry. We'll help him.Mine was taller. Aramis swings out of the saddle and begins to perform last rites over the bodies. D'Artagnan still can't be- lieve what just happened. He turns to Porthos. Porthos raises the barrel to his lips and blows away the gunsmoke.See to our horses and bring us some food.You fight like a Musketeer. Let's see if you can drink like one.Famous last words. What shall we drink to?Love. Would you like to hear a story, d'Artagnan? A love story? Athos' voice reveals unexpected vulnerability, the pain he keeps inside. D'Artagnan is fascinated, moved. He nearly whispers:I once knew a man... one of the Counts of Berry. My native province. When the good Count was about your age, he fell in love with a visitor from Paris. A breathtaking girl of seventeen. She was more than beautiful, d'Artagnan. She was... intoxicating. And this man, the poor idiot, he married her.Be quiet and listen. The Count took her to his castle and made her the first lady of the province. They were happy for a time, as happy as a man and a woman can be. Then one day, while riding in the woods, the girl was thrown from her horse, and knocked unconscious. The Count hurried to help her. Her dress was torn.On her her arm, the woman wore a gold band in the shape of a serpent. It was the only article of clothing she refused to remove. The Count's curiosity got the best of him. He reached over and slid down the gold band. He saw something on her arm... something she'd kept hidden 'til then...The fleur d'lis. She'd been branded...The Count's angel turned out to be a murderess who escaped the Executioner's blade. She swore that she loved him. Swore that she had changed. And if he would just keep her secret, they would live a long life together. Athos pauses, imagines that life. The Count and his angel.But the Count was young and he was stupid. He was tormented by the ridicule of his social class. And so he rejected her. For her lies and for her past. And turned her over to the authorities to be executed for the crime.But you see... his heart did not agree. The Count soon realized what she had meant to him. And what he had done.That his... betrayal was far greater than her own. Soon after he foreswore the society that shaped him. Gave up his title. And was never seen again.He killed her. It seemed like the same thing after a while.Good. More for me.Only if I can lead.Well?A connon ball.Stay with us, and you just might get your wish. Athos spurs his horse across the field, d'Artagnan and the Musketeers follow. But they discover crude battle- ments in their path. Athos changes direction, sees six horsemen waiting for them in the near distance. He changes direction again, as the horsemen charge after.Split in half! D'Artagnan rides with me!Or hell!They'll catch up eventually.Well. You have your boyhood wish at last. The dark forest. The thrill of the hunt. The nearness of death. Only d'Artagnan is the hunted, not the hunter.I just wanted to save you from the life of a Musketeer. You don't have to go looking for experience, d'Artagnan. It'll find you soon enough. And when it does -- it will mark you forever.I'll hold them off for as long as I can. Go on without me.Ride to Calais and stop the Cardinal's agent.Go, or I'll kill you myself.You're insane.All right. I'll toss a coin. Tails I stay, heads you remain. Agreed?Tails. I stay.Don't let us down... Musketeer. There are tears in d'Artagnan's eyes. He knows Athos hasn't got a chance.Go! Athos turns away, SHOOTS at another horseman. D'Artagnan runs to his MOUNT, GALLOPS away.Sorry I'm late. Did I miss anything? D'Artagnan almost cries with happiness. He leaps to his feet and embraces Athos.Keep your mind on the mission, d'Artagnan.Boy, it's a miracle you're still alive fighting like that.First, always find your enemy's weakness. Second, take advantage of it. Watch me.Did you find the Cardinal's spy?Did you kill him?What?No.Stop!! Milady takes a halting step, then turns to face him. Athos holds his musket in a steady hand. A very long beat. Milady takes a step closer. Finally, she whispers, with love, with hate:How did you do it, Sabine? How did you come back from the dead?I did not.Give me the Cardinal's treaty.Then I will shoot. Athos cocks the trigger. Milady whispers:I know someone who does. D'Artagnan, Aramis, and Porthos watch in grim silence as Athos crosses the room to an imposing door. CUT TO:I'd like a word with your prisoner.No.I could not give it, Sabine. I was... a fool. Milady hears the regret in his voice, holds his gaze. Athos indicates Armand in the corner.Did you kill his brother and his father as he says?But not before. Not us.Do you know the Cardinal's plans?Tell me.I can't.Sabine. You'll die for your crimes. Nothing can stop that. But how you leave this world is up to you. Milady offers a half-smile, takes his hand in hers.Die in peace.No.Forgive me, Sabine. Please forgive.Musketeers.The King's life in danger. We have work to do.Look through the surrounding area. We'll try to reach the King...Go!Save the King!!Greetings, Monsieur Cyclops. Are we interrupting?Majesty, his heart has only one desire. To become a Musketeer. D'Artagnan looks at Athos, thankful for the intercession.

With the grace of an aerialist, Porthos jumps from the balcony and lands atop the chandelier. His weight causes the chains suspending it to break. With a whoop of pleasure, Porthos rides the chandelier down as it lands squarely atop Jussac's Guards, squashing them.Ready when you are. Athos and Aramis sheathe their swords, put on their hats, wrap their capes around them and cross the room to join Porthos.My aim was off. I was trying to hit Jussac.What did he say?Tunics? Coming right up. Porthos reaches inside his cloak and takes out a crumpled red tunic he took from one of the Cardinal's guards. He drops it on the ground, digs into a pocket and takes out another. He finds another in his boot and another up his sleeve. There's one in his hat. Like a magician, he keeps pulling red tunics out of the most bizarre places.It doesn't matter where I go or what I do. Sooner or later somebody's calling me 'outlaw.' Athos cuts him off with a look. He's familiar with Porthos' propensity for tall tales. But not here, not now. Athos turns back to the balcony. Rochefort lobs a taunt.Same thing, these days.Well, if we're going to be outlaws, I suppose we'll have to get our affairs in order.Alphabetically seems... fair.Outlaws.But, Catherine, don't you see? As an outlaw I'll be constantly on the run from the Cardinal's guards, a refugee. Think of all the places you can hide me. I'm thinking of them now.Do you know where this sash comes from?It is a gift from the Queen of America. Porthos' righteous indignation is more impressive than his knowledge of current affairs. D'Artagnan corrects.Madame Augustine, would you excuse me for a moment, I'm going to kill him. Now, where were we?I was?Everywhere I go, it's always the same. There's always some kid who thinks he's hot with a sword... some itchy punk who wants to go up against the great Porthos...The great Porthos. Me, you idiot.Don't you know who I am?All right, you little puke! You want to die? So be it! One o'clock behind the Luxembourg! And bring a coffin!What're you doing? You can't fight this man.Because I'm fighting him.Oh, don't be stupid. Of course we intend to resist. Just give us a second.Interesting odds. Five of them and three of us.Bold and brave.D'Artagnan? The name has meaning for all of them. The Musketeers look at each other, deadpan, shake their heads.It couldn't be.Well. Now that we're all acquainted...Damn monks. Always spoiling everybody's fun.They're about to get a little nearer to the hilt of my sword.Papist. Porthos slides over to handle one of Aramis' opponents. He'd rather bicker from close range. But Biscarat struggles to his feet, grabs his saber. Porthos sees him, sighs.Excuse me?God, I love my work.Do you know where this bolo comes from?Spain.Go home, find a wench, live long and prosper.He really is cold and unfriendly.Do you believe this kid.Rochefort's got the boy.Definitely. A plan. And with that, they gallop after.Don't worry, boy. You won't feel a thing. The Captain of the Guards gives Aramis a suspicious look.Well, what have we here?How considerate of the Cardinal to provide us with a snack.Trinkets for the ladies.Champagne?Don't go away.May I recommend this find Cabernet? Porthos hands the bottle to Athos. Athos hands the reins to d'Artagnan. D'Artagnan struggles with the reins, tries to control the horses. And beams, taking delight from every instant of adventure. Athos SMASHES the top of the BOTTLE, drinks deeply, settles back to enjoy himself.That's it. Next time, you drive.I'd give five years of your life just to see the Cardinal's face!I heard of a d'Artagnan once. He was a captain in the Musketeers when we were just recruits.I knew there was something familiar about this boy.You already have. His name is the Count De Rochefort. D'Artagnan isn't listening. He stands suddenly, turns, and walks away. He doesn't want the Musketeers to see the tears forming in his eyes. Aramis shouts after:Go on.The Duke of Buckingham?This messenger and the treaty will prove the Cardinal a traitor. If we can get our hands on them.But with three men trying, one of us might be able to make it.It's not a threat, it's a fact. If you don't haul those kegs away, you're dead where you stand. The Farmer laughs, contemptuously. He raises his pistol and aims it at Porthos' head. But before he can pull the trigger, THREE EXPLOSIONS ERUPT from under the cloaks of Athos, Porthos and Aramis. When the smoke clears, d'Artagnan is startled to see the three dead \"Farmers\" sprawled in the road and the three pistols emerging from beneath the cloaks of the Musketeers.Mine hit the ground first.There's only one rule, d'Artagnan -- stay alive.Ladies, you're in for a treat tonight. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm the Musketeer they call Porthos. Porthos beams, waiting for a big response but nothing happens. The Barmaids look at each other.Porthos.Oh, shut up, Aramis.I don't get it. I just don't get it.I said, 'A Queen is no different than a barmaid in the dark. Though less... practiced in the arts of pleasure...'If you're going to be a proper Musketeer, you'll have to learn the manly art of wenching. Right, ladies? The Barmaids heartily concur. D'Artagnan looks over Porthos' shoulder, to the dark-haired Barmaid seen previ- ously. Porthos follows his gaze, grins.Ahh, very good. Your first subject. But you'll need instruction. Watch closely. Porthos pulls one of the Barmaids to his chest, brings her lips toward his.The secret to wenching is the first kiss. For in that kiss, a lasting impression is made. If it is weak, she will think you are weak. And if it is comical, she will think you are a clown. With me?Very good. And as a Musketeer is never weak, and only rarely a clown, your first kiss must be all the things that you are. Like this... Porthos gives the Barmaid a powerful kiss. He breaks it, turns to d'Artagnan with a grin.You may speak first if you like, your name, her name, an endearment or two. But words are usually a waste of time.That's cheating. The Barmaid on his lap disagrees.Come on, d'Artagnan. We haven't got all night.The boy's a natural.Athos takes his drinking seriously. Ignore him. He'll be his usual warm, charming self by morning. Service! My lap is cold! A Barmaid scurries INTO VIEW. Porthos grabs her by the waist, adds the Barmaid to the one already sitting on his lap. The chair breaks beneath them, and all three go sprawling on the floor, laughing heartily.Aramis -- play something with some blood in it! I feel like dancing! Aramis launches into something appropriate. Porthos and a Barmaid get up and begin a festive folk dance. Porthos is damned good. His joie de vivre is infectious and soon everyone in the inn is clapping and encouraging him. Every once in awhile, another WEAPON -- a dagger or something -- drops out of Porthos' clothing and hits the floor with a CLATTER.Care to dance, Athos?Aramis! Athos made a joke!Beautiful morning, eh, d'Artagnan?You know, d'Artagnan, it's not a good idea to travel on an empty stomach. You really should have had a big portion of those sheep's brains...Whistling? I'm not whistling.The Barmaid's kiss left him dizzy.I hate cannon balls.And you?Here's just the thing. A nice, relaxing boat ride. At the bottom of the hill: a crude ferry lands at the bank of a swift, choppy river.What? Aramis takes Porthos by the shoulder and turns him so he can see their pursuers pouring over the top of the hill on their horses.We sail!Popularity has its price.We'd be happy to. Porthos produces a bottle from under his cloak.If you'll drink one with us to the King.All right. I'll object.Let's see. You are, by your dress and by your manner, members of a bone-lazy class of servile ninnyhammers whose slavish allegiance to His Eminence the Cardinal is as that of a dog who likes nothing better than to sniff today where he has peed the day before.Piss is piss, no matter what robes surround it.I was momentarily inspired.Maybe there's something about us that just pisses people off. At least I'd like to think so. It's too bad we can only kill them once.I've been called a lot of things in my time...But beef-witted is a little more than I can stand, not to mention unfair...What? Aramis indicates the opposite shore as the flatboat approaches it. There, waiting patiently, swords and muskets already drawn... is a patrol of Cardinal's Guards.No. My horse can.But...?No, no. Please. After you.Well I certainly hope so. After all that hard work.Remind me to tell you the story of horses that could fly above raging waters. A heroic tale of love, death, and Musketeers. Suitable for the general public. Porthos wades into the Bodyguards, at play, shouting as he goes.All right then. All those who wish to die, raise your hands! Don't by shy, there's plenty to go around! D'Artagnan grabs a sword from the deck, turns to join the fray. And finds himself face to face with Parker, the Indo-Chinese bodyguard. Parker has two Oriental swords spinning in his hands. One knocks d'Artagnan's sword out of his hand. D'Artagnan does a back flip but falls on the slippery deck. As Parker is about to chop d'Artagnan's head off, his face grimaces as he is lifted on a sword OUT OF FRAME. In the mist Athos is revealed!I told you I was famous.Privateer. There's a difference. Every Musketeer is running from something or someone. D'Artagnan deadpans:What about the King?Athos -- But Athos breaks free. Milady rises to her feet. Athos rushes to her.His name's d'Artagnan, Sire.Do my eyes deceive me?His lips, unused as they are to such a contortion, twisted and stretched... into a smile.Truth... honor...Weren't you listening?",
