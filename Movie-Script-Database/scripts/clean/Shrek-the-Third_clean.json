There's a mean person doing mean things to good people-And they really need your help to get them back! So why won't you help them?Piece of cake. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 78.I'm really sorry guys.Look, don't you know who he thinks he is? How dare you?He's a star people! Hello?! I'm so sorry about this Mr. Shrek.I assume you have everything ready for tonight! You did get the list for the dressing room?Ow.It's Artie, actually.Then who's it about? I'm supposed to be King, right?But you said the King asked for me personally.What's that supposed to mean?You were playing me the whole time.You know, for a minute there, I actually thought you -Oh please, don't act so innocent. You both knew what was going on the whole time and you kept it to yourself.It's not? I think it seems pretty clear. He was using me. That's all there is to it.Everybody stop!Who really thinks we need to settle things this way?You're telling me you just want to be Villains your whole lives?Didn't you ever wish you could be something else?Okay, fair enough. You're right. I'm not a talking tree. But, ya know, a good friend of mine once told me that just because people treat you like a villain, or an ogre...... or just some loser......it doesn't mean you are one.The thing that matters most is what you think of yourself.If there's something you really want, or there's someone you really want to be, then the only person standing in your way ...is you.No, no, no!
