{"Single-White-Female": {"ALLISON": {"raw_line": "And I want them to look like you.Sure. So, is this gonna be a real wedding ?You know what I mean, Sam. You've already been through the big ceremony with too hundred people.Naked skydiving ?It's OK. It's going to have to be a small one, you know. I've not been in New York long enough to know very many people.Oh, you're invited.And my friend Graham upstairs.You're the only friend I need. You're the best thing that ever happened to me.Hello ?... Hold on a second.Sam, it's your ex-wife. She gives the receiver to Sam. Still half-asleep, Sam takes the phone.It's Lisa.It's where you live. She's entitled.Talk to her now. You're already up. I'll get that. We hear the beep at the end of Allison's message.I take it back. She's not entitled.I'm sorry... Sam left. I told him to. And... And I can't be alone tonight... so I came up here.Thanks.What time is it ?Oh, my GodI've got a meeting. It's really important.Hi !I'm sorry, I'm a little late. They shake hands.Thank you.So...You can redefine your product on-screen without going to an expensive designing concept. This is Allison Jones' software, and it's a marketing tool no one else has.I stay to be the person to speak. That's included in the quote.Best for last.I think you'll find that's reasonable... as a ballpark.No, I wouldn't rely much on what she says. It was not a friendly split. And I did all the work. And... she took all the credit and she didn't like me telling her so.Well, I could go for something...I'll get this. You'll see it on my first expense report.It's just living alone, you know. I thought about buying those books like \u00abCooking for One\u00bb. It's just too depressing.Maybe it's all a sign I should go home.You'll find someone again.I know that. I can do it on my own.I'll just get a room-mate.Not if I have a room-mate.Oh, yes, that's a promise. Rent-stabilized, so you couldn't come on the lease.Oh !... Hi !Yes... I'm Allie.You know what ? I'm not. Would it be all right if you came back tomorrow ?No, I'm fine.I just... I don't think I had lunch, that's all. Hedra tries to get some water at the sink, but just gets a strange noise.It's only this one. The one in the bathroom works. Here...I use a wrench.Oh ! Wow !... Wow !... I'm so sorry. ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAYOh, yes...Hedra... that's unusual.Not Hedy ? Like Hedy Lamarr ? That's exotic.Thanks.Oh ! You can just toss that. I was just cleaning up. He's the reason why I'm looking for a new room-mate.Well, nothing going to change it, except for... maybe that my faucets will work. When can you move in ?Congratulations.I've got one friend. Graham. He lives just upstairs...Oh, not like that : he's gay. So, anyway, it's not a real friendly building, but, at least, there's no problem with privacy. 'Cause, I mean, you just close your door...No problem.Anyway.Laundry room.I don't go in there at night. It's a bit creepy. It's okay in the day, but, still, lock yourself in.No, that's mail key.Oh, it's not bad, it's just kind of old.Sometimes this gets stuck and you have to use this screwdriver.Excuse me.ElevenOkay.I think you look very comfortable.Oh !... I think that looks niceBut I found this.I think you'd look great with that.I think you should take them.Well, I think they go great with that dress.Well...God! I didn't know you were home. I was...I was... I was... God, I'm sorry. You haven't even been here two weeks and I'm already in your room. I was just about to go through your drawers !Oh, I hope you don't mind. I just... I always wanted to try that.Well... I don't really know about that. I'm an only child. Do you have... a big family ?Oh, that's so sad.Oh... nothing. It's just a little housewarming. It's like that.Oh no no...But I can't take these.Thanks, they're great.Excuse me.Hello ?...No, Sam. SAM Why not ?... Why not ?...No, it's not a good time.No, there's nothing to talk about anyway. Sam, there's somebody here right now...All right ?... Okay... Bye.Yoo-hoo !Well, I hope they meant it.Oh ! Come on.Okay. Come on. Shhh !God, Hedy, thanks. I never would've got it done without you.Ready ?Who, Hedy ?No, no, it's a lot of fun having a girlfriend again.You were great, Graham. I just had to spend some time with her. She needed a lot of help moving in. Plus, I've been working like crazy. I promised I'm not avoiding you.Fine. Sure, I'll watch Carmen.It's so cruel. We'll be fine.Oh !... That's Hedy. I really freaked her out about people knowing she's living in the building. I would've had you down to meet her... but she's shy.Well.Friday ?Hey, I thought you'd be at work.Don't tell me we have the same belt. Hedra looks down at her belt. She seems embarrassed by something.You have to see these. Look, cookies for dogs.I had to get them. They're so great.Buddy !What are you doing here ? Hedy !Why can't you just leave me alone ?Easier that way, Okay ? Is that so hard to try to make it easier on me ?Wait a minute. You lied to me ! If she hadn't called, would I have found out ? I think that's really scary, okay ? Please, if you want to be nice, just stay away.Well, I guess it is. And... I didn't get any letter. So, I wasn't trying to punish you by not answering it. I just didn't get it.Well, I didn't get those, either. What did it say ?You really hurt me, Sam.I don't know. Just got herself on hands. Haste wouldn't do. I'm sure she'll understand.God, Hedy, what are you doing in my room ?Sorry, I guess I just didn't think.Okay, okay, I'm sorry. It was thoughtless, really. You're making me feel like I'm sixteen years old here.Hey, are you okay ?Yeah... Yeah, I made him suffer.Right.Thanks.No, no, wait a little. You'll find someone, Hedy. I mean, God, if I can...Well, anyway, Sam's going to keep his place for a while. I know you just spent a lot on furniture.Nothing's happened, Hedy, come on. Look, I'll talk to Sam. Well... Well, maybe we'll move, I don't know. Maybe, we'll find some place like this, or... I don't know. But, we'll see, we'll figure something out. Okay ?Let's set up a demo, to show them something. Something special, something different, you know. Maybe at night, you know. Open bar, open minds. That's \u00abF\u00bb night.Great.Oh no, that's Graham Knox. He is my upstair neighbor. That was just for last night. Oh, he's the first one.Well, maybe you start spreading the word.Great. Press \u00abenter\u00bb. That's it.You thirsty ?I'll be right back, okay.We going ?All right, Hedy, he's fine. Poor guy's doesn't who's who anymore.No, I'm okay. I'm fine. I just didn't get a very good sleep, that's all. Nightmares. Okay ?You don't have to do that, Hedy. You're doing enough already.Oh, no, it's kind of an anniversary tonight. So I think we'll be eating out.It's easier this way, believe me. And this could be nice.This is such a mess. I just can't do it right now. I think I'm her only friend.Hello ?... Hi, Mitch...What ?God ! I know... I'm... No, I'm just... I'm just running a little late.I didn't forget. I dunno... Just hold them till five, okay ? Thanks.Thank you.Oh no, here, I've got to go. I'm just cleaning a bit.Well... Block up some time for me next week. Then... it's just a little late tonight.Okay... Something simple.All right... You know, this is just the Mickey-Mouse stuff, but it does come in handy. Close-up on the computer screen. The \u00abFontana Fashions\u00bb file is on. We see the outline of a model, then a small window appears on the model. It says \u00abAre you sure you want to quit ?\u00bb and below two choices, \u00abCancel\u00bb or \u00abOK\u00bb. Allison chooses \u00abOK\u00bb. \u00abFontana Fashions\u00bb file disappears, replaced by another window that says \u00abSearch by vendor\u00bb, and in the bottom of the window, \u00abEnter Vendor Name:\u00bb, with an empty box underneath.Okay. Enter the vendor's name.Very good.That's all right. Barbara will handle that.Well, I hope you're satisfied with what I've done.But this is it. I mean, there ain't much more. Just maybe a little fine tuning, that's it. I have some free time now, if you want us to set up some meeting with your colleagues.What are you doing ?Mitch, please, don't. That's enough.Mitch...Let me turn around, okay ?I can't believe I didn't see it coming. It's just so humiliating.But what I did... It was like something inside taking over. It was scary.He'll pay. I set up all my programs, so they have to eventually.You don't understand. It's the contacts more than the money. When I just took the job for the word of mouth and now that's gone. It's just like he's put me back to square one.What can I do ?Who are you calling ?Who are you talking ? Hedra shushes Allison with her finger.Gee, Hedy, I hope you never get mad at me.Oh, Hedy, I'm not really up for this today.Oh, Hedy.Thank you.You've got to be kidding.You just should've asked first.Can I have the Consumer Market, please.Thank you... please.Ellen Besch...Oh, no, thanks. I'm just going up and visit Graham.Okay.Have fun.Taxi !It's very important. She has something of mine.No, thanks.God, you've got to help me, Graham. You've got to tell me what to do.And she stole a letter that Sam wrote me. I have to do something. Graham gets up from the couch.You're right. I'll tell her tonight.I can't just throw her out on the street. I mean, she obviously needs help.That was very impressive.Thanks.Oh, tomorrow.Yeah.Oh... What do you hear ?Oh, no ! Oh no ! I'm... I'm sorry.I'm so sorry.Yeah. She's my problem. I'll handle it.Thank you for the tea. I'll see you tomorrow.Hedy ? She puts her keys on the shelf by the door.Hedy ?Hedy ?Hello, Mr. Besch, you don't know me, my name is Allison Jones. I think my room-mate Hedra is your daughter. Ellen. I'm not sure, really. She's... She's been under a lot of stress lately... And... Well... Huh... Huh... God... I really, really would not get into this on the answering machine. Could you please give me a call ? Or her ? I'm sure you have the phone number. It's 2-1-2-5-5-5-9-8-1-4.Oh, thank you.It's okay, it's just I was starting to worry. You've been in here so long. I'm making some tea. Do you want some tea ? Camomile.Are you crampy ? Sometimes tea helps. Something warm. We could talk.About Sam and I wanting this place for ourselves......It's just crazy keeping two places like this.Well, frankly, I think that's my business. I'm sorry, but it is.No, that's not it at all. You've been a good room-mate. It's just... This is the man I'm going to marry. I want us to start our lives together.Is it Sam ?I'm expecting a call from Sam. He might be coming in tonight.I understand. Hey, we'll still be friends. We'll keep in touch.Hedy ?... Hedy ?Hedy ? Hedra looks up at Allison, but doesn't stop her cleaning.No, Hedy, I didn't mean for you to move out today.Sure, that's fine. Look, I'm really sorry it didn't work out.I'll help.We can have breakfast when you get back.Sam Rawson's room, please, room 6-12..Oh... I just suddenly felt sick. It was the funniest thing. I hope I'm not pregnant.Oh, that's all right, I'm fine.Yeah. I can go out for a while. I feel much better now.Oh, it's in the blender. I've got to go out.I'm out. I'm just going to go upstairs and see Graham. He called while you were out.Maybe you're right.Why ?... Why ?But... but you shouldn't run. That'll only make it worse. I know you weren't yourself when you did this, Hedy.Hedy, it'll never work. Besides ... people have seen you. We just can't tell. We'll go to a lawyer or a doctor and they'll explain it to the police, or something.Nobody's home.He must be sleeping. We were up late last night.Graham ?Mmmm !Please...Shhh !... It's okay. It's okay.Great.Hm-m. And you can pay by credit card.L.A., right ?First class ?Well, we can use one of Graham's cards. I think I saw his wallet in the living room.I know I saw it somewhere. Maybe it's in the kitchen.No ! No ! No ! No !Be careful, she's crazy.Where is she ?No one who knows me will believe that I wrote that. I was never that scared. Well... not like that.Okay.I'm not like your sister, Hedy. Not any more. I'm like you now.Get off him !Graham, stay inside !", "clean_line": "want look like sure gonna real wedding know mean sam ve big ceremony people naked skydiving ok going small know ve new york long

{"raw_line": "Hi !... The front door was kind of open. Are you Allison Jones ?Oh, I'm Hedra Carlson. We spoke on the phone this morning.Are you sure you're okay ?Why don't you just... sit down.I'll make you some tea.I got terrible nicknames growing up, which I'm not telling you.Well, I wasn't that exotic in grade school... as opposed to now, right ?They're dry. She picks them up, gets them off the hangers, and gives her jacket to AllisonHere.Oh !...Do you know if there is a chance that you guys patch things up ? As... I do not want to move in and catch you being bound again, and then have things change. It would just be awkward.No, really ?Thank you.A friend ?Yeah.I'll leave you alone, you know... I mean, whatever's good for you.Wow !Hey, look, Allie, this could be good, huh.This one ?This is creepy.Fourteen, please.Look what I found.I'm not sure. Hold on, I'll check.Allie, it's Sam.Where do you guys learn to dress like that ? I mean, it's just so New York.Yeah, I never know what looks good.Yes ?Oh !OkayHey ! What do you think ?Oh God, you like them ?You take themI'll just borrow them when I want to.That smells nice on you.Oh God, no. anything you want... you want.Go ahead. Share and share alike.Hu-uh... There's just me.I am... Well, I was supposed to be a twin, but she was stillborn.I grew up like a part of me was missing.Allie ! God !It's beautiful. Thank you. What do I owe you ?Shhh !...They look beautiful on you.It's housewarming.Oops !Why don't we order some Chinese ?Buddy !Oh, yes, you're a good clean boy. You're going to cheer her up, are you ? Hmm ? You're going to cheer her up. So she'll let you stay.I know I shouldn't have, but they were just giving him away... in the market. But they said I could bring him back to-morrow.Well... his name's Buddy. I had a dog named Buddy when I was little.Tomorrow, okay. I promise.You're working so hard.I love helping. She tries to move the puppy, who wants to move the other way.Wait... Wait...Oh yeah ! Family portrait.Yeah.No.Well... Yeah ... Sorry... Listen, I have to talk to you.Oh, they're great.Can I just talk to you for a second...I tried to let you know.I've got to get out of here now. Unless you need me...Okay.Oh, yes, towards the front, against the wall.Hi, Allie, it's me. I'm just calling to see if you're okay. ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAYHey ! It's not for you !Where the hell have you been ? Allison gasps at that somber voice in the dark. Hedra switches the bed-light on. She is sitting on Allison's bed, with her legs covered by the sheet, and the puppy on her laps. She is wearing her night-dress, with a pink sweater on her shoulders.I've been waiting since six o'clock last night to hear from you. I'm worried sick. Buddy was crying. I thought I might as well come in here, so it calm down.No, you didn't. There's such a thing as a phone, you know. This is New York. Things happen.Yeah... Yeah. Just... forget it. So, I guess you've patched things up with Sam, huh ?Is that an engagement ring ?Beautiful ring.Really great. She walks to the door.I'm sure you'll be very happy ... you'll be very happy and I'll be alone.Why don't you look in the mirror ?... Huh ? Look !Look ! You're in a different league. I know that. You have this great personality. You have this great style. You're running your own business. You're always going to find someone. You'd have to be stupid to think that you wouldn't.Well, I guess you... you and Sam want to be together. So... I have to move out, right ?... No ?Yeah, your timing is great, Allie, it's really great ! You promised me this wouldn't happen. Exactly what...Well, you'd know more about that than I would.Oh, hi !Oh well... Well I think I'll turn in. Goodnight, Allie.Goodnight, Sam.They'll get cold.Hi !Scrambled or fried ?Buddy, come here, boy. She takes a piece of bacon out of the plate and shows it to the puppy.You've got a good day for it if it doesn't get too hot.Oh, I don't mind. It's clean when you can't tell I'm here.Oh... Hey, if the eggs were okay, maybe you guys can trust me with dinner. Do you know when you'll be back ?Really ? Well, that's great... Well, good luck. We can see, by her expression, that Hedra is not very happy about what she just heard, but she keeps a smiling face.Goodbye.Buddy, come here.Come here, sweetie.I know... I know.Buddy, come !What ?But I thought we could leave it open. I know you fixed it this morning.It's me. I interrupted you when I called you in for breakfast. And Allie, it's my fault.Allie !Are you still going on that trip tomorrow ?If I'd just let you finish your work this morning...No, Allie, don't turn this around. You're the victim. He should pay for this.What ! I'm not talking about getting paid, I'm talking about getting even.Only if you let him. But you won't let him, will you ?Oh, Allie...Of course, Sam's away. I didn't want to say anything... How he could go on that trip the day after Buddy died.Especially when it was his fault.Hello ! May I speak with your husband, please ?Yes, I know it's late. Tell him it's Allison Jones, he'll take the call.Listen, you pathetic shit. Do you want to hold on to your business ?... No, you listen to me this time, asshole ! If you trash me around town, you're fucked and your family is fucked, too ! You got that ? It won't just be you.Let me tell you, he is pissing in his p.j.'s right now.What ?No, no, no, this is going to be fun. It'll make you feel better, promise. Okay ? And I'm paying. Go.Let's go.It'll be fine, come on.Well, I wanted it to be a surprise. They stop at a newspaper stand.This feels so good on my neck. I didn't think you'd mind.Do you want me to fix you something before I go ?Okay.I love myself like this.Yeah.I love myself like this.Taxi !Hey !Come on, Jim.Diet.Yes.Allie ?I'm home.Allie ?Allie ?God...Goodnight.I'm sorry...No, Please... Please... I didn't do anything wrong.I'm sorry, I didn't do anything.What ?I can't hear you.Yeah... that'd be great.Mine always comes when I'm wearing something nice.About what ?Well... Well, I... I thought you wanted a long engagement so you could make sure you can trust him again.Huh-huh... It's me, isn't it ? I'll change, Allie. I can change.Well... He will cheat on you again, that's a promise. And when he does, don't come running to me, okay ? Cause... I've had it with you. You're so fucking weak !I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.Allie ?Hello ?Obscene phone call. New York !Find someone else, jerk !Just for a little while, okay. Sam will call back if it's busy.I'm sorry, Allie.It's no big deal. I'll find some other place. You know, I just... I don't want you making a mistake.Sure.No, it's Hedy.It's after two. Do you want me to wake her ?Goodnight, Sam. Sleep well.No, not Allie.Hey !Hey, sleepy guy.I knew it.I told her. Guys like you don't change. You can't be faithful. And now she'll know.You knew it was me. Come on ! You knew and you didn't care. Well, I think she should know that.Well, I don't expect you to understand her friendship.That's not true.Huh-huh.She needs me. Who was there for her when her boss almost raped her ?Could you care of her ? You were off on a business trip or screwing someone.That's right, she told me.So... don't try and make me think that we're not close. We lean on each other and we... we protect each other. We're best friends.Yeah, well, sticks and stones...Sam !I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look, I know you want to save face. I won't tell her, okay ? Just... Just pick up the phone and call her and tell her you're going back to your ex-wife, or something. And I won't say a word, okay ?Goodnight.Oh, hi ! I hope I didn't wake you. I got an early start.Oh, there, I think that's it.I hope you don't mind. I'm storing some of my stuff in the cage downstairs.That way, I won't have to bother... You see what I mean... You know... I mean...Well, I'd better get this stuff out of here. Allison walks to the door.Allie ?What are you doing down there ?Let me help you.I'll get some water.Wait !Drink some.Okay ?Feeling better ?I thought you said breakfast ?Dressed like that?Well, still, if you're not feeling well, you should wear more than that.Oh...You know why I think you're sick ?You're upset about Sam.You know Sam's dead, don't you ?Yeah, we don't have much time.Allie, he came in my mouth. Then he tried to beat the shit out of me because I wanted to tell you.You know, it was an accident. But he deserved it.Okay, come on. The police will be here soon.I know. I was you.Who is this Hedy anyway ?No one's seen her. She's not on the lease. There's not even a fingerprint of hers here. I've been cleaning like crazy. You have to come with me, Allie, or they'd put you away.No.Why are you making me do this ?We're friends, Allie. You could be in a lot of trouble without me. But I'm not going to leave you.That wouldn't be right. I won't leave you. Okay, let's go. Up ! Up ! Up !Go ! Go-go-go !No-no, up to Graham's. Come on. No-no, he's already involved.Use these. Come on, come on, hurry up. Go !He can't hear you.Your color was beautiful, but I can't go around looking like you any more, can I ?Okay now, Allie, don't laugh.Ta-dah !How's that ? Good ?22 and 24 are the movie channels. I've got to cash a pay cheque. So I'll only be gone an hour. I know how you hate to be alone. Okay... Are you good and comfortable ? All right.So, well... When I get back, we'll do your hair, too. Okay ? Be good. Bye.Excuse me ?Well, maybe next time I'll try blonde.Yes ?Oh !No, no, I'm just watching the place for the week-end like that. It's on a timer. Huh... Huh... I'm sorry.Please, I'll turn it off. I will. She enters the apartment and closes the door shut behind her.How could you do that ? Everything I've done, I've done for you. Don't you understand that ? People you hated, I hated.People like you don't care.Just like that stupid girl in Tampa. She called my parents, too. Told them all my secrets.You want to put me away, huh ?I can't... I can't keep making excuses for you, Allie. I can't... I can't... I can't... I can't... I can't...Oh God !... Oh God !... Ohhh !What ?... What ?No.Can you make reservations on this ?Yeah.Things are going to be different in L.A, Allie. You'll see.Is it worth it ?Oh... Me too. Okay, I'll go and see.Going down.No, he's on a cruise.Who are you ?Oh... There's no one named Jones on this floor.Well, I'm the only one here and I never met her. So... You'll excuse me.Get off of her.You think she wants you touching her, huh ? I said get off her !I don't want to try to be loved any more. And you know...I don't want to be scared any more. Or to kill any more. I don't want to kill any more. I don't want to be alone any more. I don't want to be anything any more. I don't need a reason to kill myself, I need a reason not to and there isn't one.You don't want to say anything special to anyone ?Okay, \u00abAllison Jones\u00bb, go on.Now they'll know it was you.Of course it's you. I never met anyone so scared of being alone. And I saved you from that, but you don't care.Did you know that identical twins are never really identical ? There's always one that's prettier. And the one who's not does all the work. She used me and then she left me. Just like you.Come on... take them. Come on, Allie, it's nicer this way.Allie !Please...Please...I'll kill you !No... No... No...No... No... No...Allie ?Hey, here you are.Don't make me come get you... Allie, come out now... Come on... Allie !...I'm scared ! Where are you ? The rat has reached Allison's hiding place. She pushes it down from the pipe where it was standing.Why are you hiding from me ?You think I can't find you ? Huh ? Your goddam shirt is sticking out of it. She opens the door, sees herself in a mirror at the back of the closet, and thinking it's Allison, bangs her hook on the mirror and breaks it.Allie...", "clean_line": "hi door kind open allison jones
