Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?Your war record? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.We'll be taking off real soon so we better fasten you in tight.That's good advice. You relax and I'll be back after we take off.Would you like something to read?How about this leaflet: 'Famous Jewish Sports Legends?'Ted, what are you doing here?You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.Excuse me.Would you like to order dinner now?I tell you what, Joey. I'll talk to the Captain and see what I can arrange.Would you gentlemen care to order your dinners?Oh, Ted, I never knew I could be so happy. These past few months have been wonderful. Tomorrow why don't we drive up the coast to that little seafood place and...What's the matter?Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.I love you.We have a visitor.This is Captain Oveur. Mister Murdock and Mister Johnson. This is Joey Hammen.We'd better get back now.Okay, if you don't get in the way.I remember everything. All I have are memories.Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!You got a telegram from head\u00adquarters today.It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.I found a wonderful apartment for us. It's got a brick fireplace and a cute little bedroom with mirrors on the ceiling. And...What's his problem?Who wants to be first?How's the weather?That's great. By the way, Joey Hammen asked me if you would autograph this basketball.Also, Supperware products are ideal for storing leftovers to help stretch your food dollar. This two quart \"Seals-M-Rite\" container with a special \"Close-M-Tite\" lid keeps hotdog buns fresh for days and prevents sugared cereals from sticking.Meat and dairy products are protected against unwanted refrigerator odors when sealed in this non-slip pastel colored \"Freez-o-leer\".Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.Yes?I'll see if I can find some Dramamine.Captain, one of the women passengers is very sick.I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.I'm sorry I had to wake you. I'm just looking for a doctor. There's nothing to worry about.Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?A hospital? What is it?Certainly.Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.He had fish.Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.He had fish, too.Just how serious is it, doctor?Uh, automatic pilot...automatic pilot?There it is!This is Elaine Dickinson. I'm the stewardess. Captain Oveur is passed out on the floor, and we've lost the co-pilot and navigator, too. We're in terrible trouble. Over.Hi, Steve!Yes. Yes, it is. Over.I'm standing over Oveur. Over.Three hundred twenty miles per hour.Thirty-five thousand feet.No, wait. Now it says thirty-four thousand feet. It's dropping! It's dropping fast! Why is it doing that?Oh, my God! The automatic pilot! It's deflating!Okay, but please hurry! We're dropping fast!Yes. Yes, I can see it.No.Well...No. No one that I know of.Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!Rain.And a little ice!Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.Doctor Rumack says the sick people are getting worse and we're running out of time.What happened, Ted?

I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?What a pisser.Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.You expect me to believe that?But if you'll just give me...Can you tell me if Elaine Dickinson is on this flight?I'd like one ticket to Chicago. No baggage!Smoking, please.Thank you.Yes.No. I've been nervous lots of times. I used to be a pilot myself...during the war.Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.Elaine, I've got to talk to you.Yes, I know. Things used to be different. I remember when we first met. It was during the war.We laughed, we talked, we danced, I never wanted it to end and I guess I still don't. But enough about me. I hope this hasn't been boring for you.It's just that when I start to talk about Elaine, I get so carried away -- I lose all track of time -- not unlike Oliver in 'Jesus: the Man.'My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.I love you, Elaine.Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.Headquarters!? What is it?Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.All right. Take five.That's Captain Geline. He thinks he's a pilot, still fighting the war.That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.No. No thank you.After the war, I just wanted to get as far away from things as possible. So Elaine and I joined the Peace Corps. We were assigned to an isolated tribe, the Molombos.I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.We did come back to the States. I tried a number of jobs...Well, I could go on for hours, but I'd probably start to bore you.You know, I really couldn't blame Elaine. She wanted a career. I was offered a job at Boeing but I couldn't bring myself to take it...You see, the day we left the village it was raining, so we had to take a special jeep to the main road...In fact, we were lucky to even get a jeep since just the day before the only one we had broke down -- it had a bad axle...The cockpit? What is it?Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.The stewardess said...Both pilots!Surely you can't be serious.Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...all together!!!Besides, I haven't touched any \u00adkind of plane in six years.Let's see, altitude twenty-four thousand feet, level flight, air speed four hundred sixty knots, course zero niner zero, trim, mixture, landing gear, balance.That's what I've been trying to tell these people.Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.Mayday!Yeah, I was just trying out the landing lights.Yes, Captain Kramer. Read you loud and clear.Let's not kid each other, Kramer. You know I've never flown a bucket like this. I'm going to need all the luck there is.Okay, I'm going to unlock the automatic pilot.Yes! The stewardess is here with me!The radio's all yours now. And keep an eye on that number three engine. It's running a little hot.And a little ice.Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?Surely there must be something you can do.Rats! I've lost number three.Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.He's right. I can't take the pressure. I was crazy to think I could land this plane.I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.I know what you're going to say, so save your breath.George Zipp said that?Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.I'll take it, Elaine.Listen to me, Kramer. Doctor Rumack says the sick people are in critical condition and every minute counts. We've got to land now!No dice, Chicago. I'm giving the orders, and we're coming in...I guess the foot's on the other hand now, isn't it, Kramer?I'll take it, Elaine. Listen, Kramer, I'm coming in. Do you hear me? I'm coming in right now! We have people up here who will die in less than an hour, never mind two. I may bend your precious airplane, but I'll get it down! Now get on with the landing check. I'm putting the gear down now.Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.Yes?Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.See them, Elaine?It's stuck.

How many times have I warned those people about food inspection?The airport management, the F.A.A., and the airlines, they're all cheats and liars! All right, let's get out of here.No, we can't do that; the risk of a flameout is too great. Keep him 24,000. No, feet!One of the passengers is going to land that plane.Possible, but it's a hundred to one shot. Thousand to one. I know this guy.His name is Ted Striker. I flew with him during the war. And that won't make my job any easier tonight.Ted Striker was a crack flight leader up to a point. But he was one of those men who, well, let's just say he felt too much inside. Maybe you know the kind.It takes a certain type to perform under pressure. Striker didn't have it.Ate his heart out over every name on the casualty lists. The upshot of it is that he went all to pieces on one particular mission. Let's just hope it doesn't happen again tonight.All right, Steve, let's face a few facts.As you know, I flew with this man, Striker, during the war. He'll have enough on his mind without remembering those days when -- well, when things weren't so good.Let me tell you something, Steve. Striker was a top-notch squadron leader -- a long time ago......but my feeling is that when the going gets rough upstairs tonight, Ted Striker's gonna fold up.Very well then. Put Striker on the speaker.Striker, Striker, this is Captain Rex Kramer speaking.All right. It's obvious you remember me.So what do you say you and I just forget about everything except what we have to do now?You and I are going to bring this plane in together.Before we start, I'd like to say something. I know that right now things must look pretty rough up there.But if you do what I tell you, when I tell you to do it, there's no reason you can't bring that plane in.Stand by, Striker. The one hope we have is to build this man up. I've got to give him all the confidence I can. All right, Striker, have you ever flown a multi-engine plane before?Shit!All right, Striker, now you listen to me and you listen close. Flying is no different than riding a bicycle...it just happens to be a lot harder to put baseball cards in the spokes. Now, if you just follow my instructions...First, I want you to familiarize yourself with the controls. Later we'll run through the landing procedure.All right. Now I'd like you to disengage the automatic pilot. But watch any violent movement of the controls, like you used to make in Spitfires and Phantoms.Not just yet, we'll have you in radar range any second now.I don't understand it. He should have been in range ten minutes ago.That's impossible. They're on instruments!This is gonna be a real sweat. Gunderson, let me know when you get anything.No, the risk of fire is too great. If she starts burning, you write off all those people who can't get out of there on their own power.No. A belly landing isn't all that simple. It takes a good pilot to keep from smearin' himself all over the runway.His only shot's with the wheels down. I've seen foam tear a man's guts out.That's a risk we'll just have to take.I told him to watch that oil temperature. What the hell's he doing up there?Striker, that plane can't land itself! It takes a pilot who can handle pressure.All right, but let's wait until they reach the control area.I know. I know. But it's his ship now, his command; he's in charge, he's the boss, the head man, the top dog, the big cheese, the head honcho...'Passengers Certain to Die?!?!?!?!?!'All right, I'll need three men up in the tower. You, Neubauer. You, Macias.Stand by, Striker. I'm going to the tower. And good luck.All right. Colosimo, you'll work the relay. Roberts, double check all air traffic within five miles.And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?Did you decide on a runway yet?Striker, you're going to have to work fast. After this message, do not acknowledge any transmission unless you want to ask a question. Do you understand? Striker, Striker, do you read me?You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.Steve, I want every light you can get poured on that field.Tower to all emergency vehicles. Runway is niner.Civilian equipment, number three.Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.Now, Striker...hold your present heading, put down full flap, bring your air speed back to a hundred and thirty-five, then I want you to take hold of the throttle...And stick it in your ear.Striker, get back to a thousand feet!Striker, you're coming in too low! What's your altitude?All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.Turn on your landing lights, Striker. It's the switch above your right knee.All right, now just listen carefully. You should be able to see the runway at three hundred feet.Aim to touchdown a third of the way along. There's a slight crosswind from the right, so be ready for it.If you land too fast, use your emergency brakes. The red handle is right in front of you.If that doesn't stop you...If that doesn't stop you, cut the four ignition switches over the co-pilot's head.Do you see us now? You should be able to see the field now.Yeah -- too quiet.There he is! Striker, you're coming in too fast!Sound your alarm bell now.Striker, now listen to me. You're coming down too fast!Bring it down! Easy!Remember your brakes and switches! Get ready to flare it out! You're coming in too fast! Watch your speed!You're coming in too hot! Put down full flaps! Watch your nose!Now ease her down! Down!Lift the nose! Throttle back!The brake! Pull the red handle!Hold her steady, hold her steady!Pull a lever!Push a button!You're too low! You're too low!Ted, that was probably the lousiest landing in the history of this airport. But there are some of us here......Lonliness, that's the bottom line. I was never happy as a child. Christmas, Ted, what does it mean to you? For me, it was a living hell. Do you know what it's like to fall in the mud and get kicked? In the head? By an iron boot? Of course you don't. No one does.
