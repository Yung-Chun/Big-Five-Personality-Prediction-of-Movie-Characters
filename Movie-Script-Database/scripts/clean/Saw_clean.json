{"Saw": {"LAWRENCE": {"raw_line": "You\u0092re not dead.There\u0092s no point in yelling, I already tried it.Would if I could.I don\u0092t know yet.Shh! Hang on a second, I think I found something.No one can hear you.Calm down, just calm down. Are you hurt?What\u0092s your name?My name is Lawrence Gordon, I\u0092m a doctor. I just woke up here, just like you.Recognize him?Well, do you have any idea how you got here?What\u0092s the last thing you remember?Well there\u0092s...there\u0092s not much to tell, really. I was on my way home from work and uh, I don\u0092t remember anything else.From the looks of these chains, someone didn\u0092t want us to go very far either.What?No one has taken your kidneys.Because you\u0092d either be in terrible agony, or you\u0092d be dead by now. Trust me.Yeah. So, you gonna tell me your name, or what?Well Adam, what we need to do is start thinking about why we\u0092re here. Whoever brought us there could\u0092ve killed us by now. But they didn\u0092t. They must want something from us. Question is what. That clock.It\u0092s brand new.So, someone obviously wanted us to know the time. Wait, I think I may be able to reach that door.What is that? Excuse me.Where did you find it?Come on, come on, come on....No?Use your shirt.Your shirt.Come on...Well, look around, there must be something else you can use.Well there must be something!Come on, you can do it.Come on, come on, again.Throw me the player.Look, we\u0092re going to have to work together if we want to get out of here. Now just throw it to me.Give me that. Now.Wait a minute.Shh, shh!Listen...There! Right next to you, on the toilet.Come on, come on.Anything?Take off the lid. Come on!Huh. What is it?Hey! Mind passing me the other one?He doesn\u0092t want us to cut through our chains. He wants us to cut through our feet. I think I may know who\u0092s done this to us.It\u0092s not someone I know personally. It\u0092s...just someone I know of.The last I heard...the police still hadn\u0092t caught him.And the only reason I know that is because I was a suspect.I\u0092ll start from the beginning.The newspapers started calling him the Jigsaw Killer.Actually, technically speaking, he\u0092s not really a murderer. He never killed anyone.He finds ways for his victims to kill themselves.Okay. This patient has an inoperable frontal lobe tumor extending across the midline. Started as colon cancer. The patient has come in for a standard checkup by which we are able to monitor the rate at which his condition is declining.The patient had...Thank you for that information, Zep. As you can see, our orderlies form very special bonds with the patients. Continuing on, the patient....Obviously someone doesn\u0092t want me to tell you what the patient has. Excuse me.Oh. Thank you, I do my best.That\u0092s fine. Now, how can I help you gentlemen?Why is it that you\u0092re interested?No, I\u0092m afraid that\u0092s...that\u0092s quite out of the question. I can\u0092t just leave, I have work to do. Plus, my wife has the car today, so...I\u0092m sorry, you\u0092ll have to tell me again. What is this all about?Of course not!I was seeing someone.I was visiting someone. It wasn\u0092t a patient. Alright? What am I gonna do?That was five months ago. He tried to set me up for murder.Good! Can I go home now?I\u0092d like to help, really, but...Okay.You mean....he was alive?Yeah, I\u0092m sure.I\u0092m in exactly the same situation you\u0092re in.What?That\u0092s not going to do anything.Well, you won\u0092t stop it. That\u0092s why we can\u0092t cut through these chains. It\u0092s why you won\u0092t break that glass. Every possible angle has been pre-thought out by him.To overcome something, you have to understand what a perfect engine it is. That\u0092s how you fight disease. Now the tape told us to find an X. That X has to be somewhere in this room. Help me find it.I AM thinking about that. I\u0092ve been the last thing I said to my daughter.Just a minute.Mmm hmm, mmm hmm, just gotta finish this paragraph.Nope! I\u0092m done.See? There\u0092s no one in your room. There\u0092s no such thing as the bad man. Now can you go to sleep?You are? Give me your tootsie. Oh, what a big tootsie. Remember this one? This little piggy went to market, this little piggy stayed home, this little piggy had roast beef, this little piggy had none, and this little piggy went \u0091Weeee!\u0092 all the way home!Well I have to go to work, sweetheart. You know what Daddy\u0092s job is like. Now, come on. Let\u0092s see. Try and get some sleep now, okay?What? What are you talking about? You mean, leave you and Mommy? No, no sweetheart, I would never do that. Who gave you that idea?Well it\u0092s not true, okay?How much do I love you?That\u0092s right, that\u0092s right! Good night, sweetie.Tomorrow, I\u0092ll read you your favourite story.Okay.What, what are you talking about?I am happy.Would you like to see her? (He reaches into his pocket and takes out his wallet, throws it across the room to Adam, who is sitting with his back against the wall, facing Lawrence. Adam picks up the wallet and opens it. He sees two pictures of Diana, side by side. The one on the left is Diana hugging a dog. The one on the right is a smiling portrait outside somewhere.Thank you.We\u0092ve talked about it, but uh, with our schedules, it\u0092s difficult enough to concentrate on one.There\u0092s another picture behind the one you\u0092re looking at. It\u0092s my favourite one because we\u0092re all in it together. Someone, usually me, has to hold the camera, which means I\u0092m always missing from the photos.What?Really? Are you sure?He...he must\u0092ve taken it. I...I am happy.We can talk about this alter, okay?Here we are. That was uh, quite an amazing story that poor woman told.Look, I\u0092m sorry I can\u0092t be of more help to your investigation.X Marks the spot... X marks the spot...we need to search this room again. What are you doing over there?Excuse me?I really don\u0092t see the point in us not helping one another.That\u0092s exactly why we need to talk. We need to think!Well then don\u0092t keep me in the dark about what you\u0092re thinking!What?Why?How come we didn\u0092t see that before?It\u0092s locked. The key, the one from my envelope. Where is it?Are you joking? You\u0092re gonna put something we found in this room in your mouth?I\u0092m trying the police. Shit. This was meant to receive calls, not make them. Wait a minute...this has happened before.Last night, after I finished at the hospital. I was walking back to my car. I thought I was alone, but I\u0092m sure someone else was there.That...thing. It was waiting for me. How did you know to turn off the lights?Yeah, but how did you know?Instinct?You know what? You\u0092re a terrible liar.What else aren\u0092t you telling me?Just stop it. You knew to turn off these lights.I\u0092m dealing with a juvenile.Yeah!Oh God... W...where did you get this?W...why didn\u0092t you show me this before?What are you doing to them you bastard?! Okay...okay.. Okay, I\u0092ve got to think now...Adam, listen to me. I want you to play along with me on this.You got that? (he turns the lights back on, both of them again wincing at the bright light. Lawrence glances at the surveillance camera, then looks to Adam.So you uh, still want that cigarette?There! I\u0092ve done it! I\u0092ve killed him with the poison, just like you wanted. Now where\u0092s my family?! Where are they?!What?What? That was our way out!Stop acting!All right, that\u0092s it! Ah, Damn it!!Who is this?Diana?Yeah baby, it\u0092s me. I\u0092m here.Don\u0092t worry honey, everything\u0092s going to be okay. Where\u0092s Mommy?Let me talk to her sweetie, okay? Put Mommy on.W...what man?Hello? Hello? Diana?Diana! Diana!Ally? Is that you?How do you know? Ally, what is going on?Hello? Ally? Ally? Hello? God damn you! If you so much as lay a finger on them, I\u0092ll kill you! You hear me? You son of a bitch! I\u0092ll kill you!My wife, she uh, she mentioned your name.She told me...not to believe you.She told me you knew me. Who are you?Stop the lies! You\u0092re a liar! I need to know the truth!That\u0092s because it\u0092s the truth.But...why?You\u0092ve uh, had these with you the whole time?Yeah, right. You\u0092re so full of it!Why did you um, deem it necessary to page me when you knew I was at home?But I gave you a precise time at which to page me. You can\u0092t do that.Look, it was wrong for me to makes you come here.-Please. I\u0092m sorry.You tell anyone you were here?For me? Hello?I-I have to go.I\u0092ve got to go. (He picks up his briefcase from the chair, and heads out the door.Who was it?The person who paid you to follow me, who was it?What does that mean? Does that mean you saw what happened to me?Clearly, whoever paid you to take the pictures of me is the one who put is in here.Maybe? What do you mean maybe? Of course it is! What did he look like?Was he tall, was he skinny, obese, what?You must remember something about him.You\u0092re telling me you don\u0092t remember a thing about the guy?Oh for fuck\u0092s sake! I give up!Tapp! Detective Tapp!No, no, he was discharged from the police force. He broke down after his partner was killed , but that didn\u0092t stop him from harassing me. The guy became obsessed. He\u0092s convinced himself that I must have somehow been involved with the murders. He\u0092s...he\u0092s crazy. And you helped him. You took money from him to invade my privacy. How could you do that?Right, right. You know what Adam? You\u0092re not a victim of this game, you\u0092re a part of it.I told you, he\u0092s not a cop. He\u0092s a bottom feeder, just like you.I did not cheat on her!!!How did I get here? I had...I had everything in order. My whole life was in perfect order.No.I know him. Zep! His name is Zep. He\u0092s an orderly at my hospital. Zep. You perverted little psychopath. I\u0092m gonna take great pleasure in seeing you pay for this! You bastard fuck!Is that you Zep, you bastard!? I know its you, you son of a bitch!Ally?Hello? Hello?Ally! Honey, are you all right?I don\u0092t know. I\u0092m being held captive in a room somewhere.I\u0092m so sorry, Ally.I\u0092m sorry for everything. It\u0092s my fault. Please forgive me. I\u0092ve always been happy with you.Ally!Ally!He...he electrocuted me...FUCK THIS SHIT!!No!!!!I can\u0092t be calm! My family needs me! No, God!You have to die.I\u0092m sorry...My family...I\u0092ve done it! Now show them to me!You bastard! I\u0092ll fucking kill you! I\u0092ll fucking kill you! You fucking bastard! I\u0092ll fucking kill you! You fucking bastard! I\u0092ll fucking kill you! I\u0092ll fucking kill you!Why?You\u0092re going to be all right. You\u0092re just wounded in the shoulder.
