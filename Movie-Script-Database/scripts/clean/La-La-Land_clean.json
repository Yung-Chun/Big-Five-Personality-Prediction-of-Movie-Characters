Did you just call yourself \"a serious musician\"?Can I borrow what you're wearing?Because I have an audition next week. I'm playing a serious fire-fighter.Uh... The coffee shop on the Warner Brothers lot. That's a classic.He just told you what to do.Mia.George Michael!Did you just get your keys?Can you grab mine?The Prius.The one with the green ribbon.Shit...They are...n't.Thank you for saving the day back there.Strange that we keep running into each other.I doubt it.What?Uh-huh.Oh my God.Eh.Agreed. I've seen better.Hey... Greg...? Can you hear me...? Yeah, I'm just leaving now... K, see you soon...Ah. Great... Well... Do you want a ride to your car?...Ok...Night.No...I have an audition. Remember?But you said --...Hi. What are you doing here?Uh-huh. How'd you get on the lot?I'm off in ten.That's the window Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart looked out of in Casablanca.Yeah. Greg.We've been seeing each other for a few months.I love this stuff. Makes coming to work easier.Oh yeah?A what?We need to wait here.Into...? Oh -- I -- my aunt was an actress. She was in this traveling theater company... And there was this little library across the street from my house when I was growing up. This was Boulder City, Nevada -- every house looked exactly the same. I was ten and already I needed to get out. And one day, my aunt flew into town, and she showed me the library's old-movie section. We spent a whole day watching one after the other. Bringing Up Baby. Notorious. Casablanca. I never knew the world was so big.I started putting on plays in my garage. I'd write the scripts and print up programs, and she'd give me props to use from wherever she'd just been -- New York, London, Paris. And then she'd jet off again and I wouldn't hear from her for another year.God no -- I didn't invite anyone. That would have been terrifying.Honestly, I wish I loved something else. I've tried so hard to want other things.I left school after two years to come here, my fourth manager just dropped me, and my last audition was for a teen soap pitched as Dangerous Minds meets The O.C. Should've been a lawyer. Revision 27.Well it doesn't need more actresses.What do you mean, \"just an actress\"?That is not what I said.Last thing I wrote was a stand-up routine for an open-mic night. It was horrible.Ok, I'll stop auditioning and make history instead.Anyway -- I'm getting a feeling there's something I should tell you...I hate jazz.It means when I listen to it I don't like it.I do hate some animals.I thought it was just Kenny G.I associate it with facials. It's relaxing.Right, but it's good to talk over. Where I grew up there's this jazz station they'd play at cocktail parties whenever they served the salami and cheese.Your club?Hi, I just missed a call...I got a call-back!That show I told you about.Right. It's -- actually more like Rebel Without a Cause.Obviously. No.It's the one I lie about....Ok. Revision 31.Ok. For research.Hi, Mom!Great, actually: I got a call-back on a pilot.Well -- it's not picked up yet.First they make the pilot, then if they like the pilot it goes on TV. Revision 32.Well, no, I have a call-back.It's another audition....Well when you put it like that it sounds like a huge accomplishment.Oxygen.You know what, I have to go. I love you.Two options. Follow my rules, or follow my rules. Kapish? You want to bully, you'd best be ready to get bullied --I can do it another way --Shit. No. Yes. I'll change...I'm sorry.I have an idea.It's a play. I'm going to put it on myself.Actually -- it's a -- it's a one-woman show...I think so.It's one-way!!Nice meeting you....You're just saying that.I don't know... Is the whole thing too nostalgic?But do you think people will like it?You always say that.Fine -- as long as you sit front-row `cause I'll probably throw up on the middle of the stage otherwise.I made something for you.It could be the name design. On the door.That's what you should name it.Sebastian, no one's going to a club called \"Chicken on a Stick\".No. Drop the chicken. Drinks and jazz. And it's time to start looking for other places.Make your own history.I'm doing that.So who was that guy at the Lighthouse?The one who offered you a gig.Why was it weird between you two?He did offer you a job.Are you going to call him?Ok......No, Mom, it's a one-woman show... No, I'm acting in it as well... No, I'm not getting paid, I'm paying to do it... He's great... He's going to open his own jazz club. It's going to be incredible... Well he has to get the money together first, and... He's figuring it out... Yeah, it's just been a little tricky lately...Look -- he's going to find a way to open it and you're going to love it. Ok? How's Dad?Thanks Harry, I'm good. Revision 52.I think today's San Diego. I'm not sure...Nothing...I guess. I'm adapting.He told me.Do you think he's happy?I mean with the band, the travel, all of it. Revision 53.Hey it's me... Not sure where you are -- maybe Boston? Or Dallas? Anyway... I haven't heard from you in a while... I miss you... Ok... Bye...Stay.I'm nervous. Revision 55.Because... What if people show up?I'm nervous to be up on a stage and perform in front of people. I'm terrified.I can.What time do you leave in the morning?Ugh.Boise?To Boise? Revision 56.Wish I could.Come to Boise?Because I have to rehearse.You mean anywhere you are?Well, all my stuff is here and my show's in a few weeks and -- I don't know, it doesn't seem practical...I know, but when are you done?When are you done with the tour? Revision 57.So it's...the long haul?I mean the long haul -- like, you're going to be in this band for a long time.I don't know, I didn't think the band would --No, that's not what I meant. What I meant was -- this band -- you're going to be on the road for -- what, years now?Do you like the music you're playing?It matters if you're going to give up your dream to be on the road for years. Revision 58.Yes. I do. I just didn't think you did.And now I hear you're going to be on the road for years, and I'm --What do you mean why am I doing this?To be in this band?Yes, I wanted you to have a job so you could take care of yourself and start your club.Why aren't you starting your club?Change the name!I do like jazz now, because of you.People will want to go to it! People love what other people are passionate about.You had a dream that you were sticking to, that --This is not your dream.Why do you care so much about being likedAre you kidding?Stop --It's over.I'm done embarrassing myself.No one showed up. I can't even pay back the theater.I'm gonna go home for a while.Not anymore.I'm ok.I'm good...You took down the swing.Oh God. Throw those away.Why did you come here?Ok...I know who she is.I'm not going.I'm -- no... That will kill me.Yes. Revision 70.I'm happier.I told you.Because it's another audition! I've been to hundreds of auditions. Do you want to know what happens? Either they interrupt me because someone ordered a sandwich, or they cut me off after two seconds, or I'm crying and they start laughing, or I'm one of a hundred lookalikes in the waiting room who never has a chance, because -- -- because --Because I'm probably not good enough.No. Maybe I'm not.Maybe I'm one of those people who's always wanted to do it but never had a chance. It's a pipe dream. Maybe it's like you said. Maybe I need to grow up.I can go back to school. I can find something else that I'm supposed to do. I left school to give it a shot, and it didn't work out, and it took six years, and I don't want to do it anymore.Why what?...Because it hurts a little bit too much.How did you find me?...Ok....About...?My aunt lived in Paris for a bit... She used to tell me these stories, when I was growing up, about living abroad... I remember -- she told me she jumped into the Seine once...They said the next couple of days... But I'm not expecting to find anything out.No, I'm not.Where are we?I mean -- where are we?What do we do?If I get this -- Revision 75.What are you going to do?Right.You know I'm always going to love you.I've seen better. Revision 76.I've never been here during the day.Hi... Iced coffee, please.No, no, that's fine.Bye, sweetie.

It's not my fault I got Shanghai'ed.What's the difference?Why do you say romantic like it's a dirty word?You're acting like life's got me on the ropes -- what you don't understand is, I want to be on the ropes.

Revision 20....Which one is it?Those look comfortable.You didn't give me much of a choice.It is strange. Maybe it means something.Yeah I don't think so either.

Probably gives you cancer, but you find your car more quickly.You don't live as long, but you get things done faster, so it all evens out.Not much to look at.No, that's fine... Thanks...Meetings.

I'll hide in the bathroom.What's your Bogart's name...? Is it Greg?How long have...?I know what you mean. I get breakfast five miles out of the way just to sit outside a jazz club.It was called Van Beek. The swing bands played there. Count Basie. Chick Webb. It's a samba-tapas place now.Samba-tapas. It's... Exactly. The joke's on history.Anyway, that's L.A. They worship everything and they value nothing.I know. They shoot movies on my street. \"C-stands.\" \"Apple box.\" \"Don't forget to sign out.\"How'd you get into all this? Revision 26.Who would you invite to watch? Your parents?...`Cause the world needs more lawyers.You're not just an actress.You said it yourself, you're a child- prodigy playwright.You're too modest to say it but it's true. So you could write your own roles. Write something that's as interesting as you are.All I'm saying is -- Louis Armstrong could have played the marching-band charts he was given. What did he do instead? He made history.Yeah? Revision 28.What does that mean? \"I hate jazz\"?But it's such a blanket statement. It's like saying \"I hate animals\".Do you need to be anywhere right now?Most people say they hate jazz because they don't have context. They don't get where it came from. All these people packed into flophouses in New Orleans, speaking five different languages, and jazz was how they talked to each other....What?It's not relaxing! Sid Bechet got into a gunfight `cause somebody told him he played a wrong note! Revision 29.Mia. These are things you can't unsay.It's not cocktail music -- it's a high- wire act. These guys are performing and composing and rearranging all at once.That's why you need to be in the space and see what's at stake. This whole thing -- it's dying. In twenty minutes they'll head off to cut commercial sessions or do pit at the Pantages `cause they have to -- but when I have my own place -- my club -- they'll play whatever they want....It's gonna be the old Van Beek. I'm getting the lease back. It'll be perfect.The world tells everyone to move on. Says the music's had its moment. But I love it too much. I'm not moving on.So?Really? For what?Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.?That's amazing! \"I got the bulletsssss!\"You've seen it, right?What? You're the movie person.Come on. You can't do this audition and never see Rebel. The theater near me's playing it. If you want -- I can take you. For research.10pm Monday at the Rialto. Cool?Keith? Revision 41.This is Mia. Mia, Keith. We used to play together.Great. You?Good for you.I'm good.I'm good.You bet.It's beautiful.No... I'm not.That's the point.Fuck `em.I truly believe it.I'll be front-row.What's that?Why does it say \"Seb's\"?Never.You don't get it. Charlie Parker got the name \"Bird\" because he loved chicken. So my club's gonna be old-school jazz and beer and chicken. \"Chicken on a Stick\".It's gotta be Van Beek. I can't let them samba all over its history.Your play's incredible.The whole world from your bedroom? Who's doing that? Revision 44....Which guy?You mean Keith? He's the worst.It's always weird with him.Right...No.Here's what we know. It's definitely Chicken on a Stick -- -- and your play is going to be a triumph.Well... Here I am.Where's the piano?Yeah, that...that... ...sounds good.You're holding onto the past. But jazz is about the future.Surprise.And... There's twenty-five pounds of apples in it. It probably destroyed an ecosystem but it tastes good.I have to head back in the morning but I needed to see you.Feels so good to be home.How's the play going?Why?Fuck `em!You're nervous about what they think?They should be so lucky to see it. It's going to be incredible. I can't wait.Yep. Boise.You should come.Yeah, you could knock that off your bucket list.Why can't you?Yeah.Can't you rehearse anywhere?...I -- I guess...Right... I just -- we're going to have to do things so we can see each other. We never see each other....What do you mean?But -- as soon as we're done with the tour we go back and record, and then we go back on tour.We tour so we can make the record, and then we go back on tour to sell the record....What does that mean?What did you think I was going to do?You didn't think we'd be successful.Yeah, feasibly -- I could be on the road for years with just this record.I don't know how that matters.Do you like the music I'm playing?Yeah, well, I --What are you doing? Why are you doing this?This is what you wanted from me.To have a steady job.So I'm doing that. So why aren't we celebrating?You said yourself no one wants to go to that club! No one wants to go to a club called Chicken on a Stick ---- and no one likes jazz. Not even you. Revision 59.What am I supposed to do? Go back to playing \"Jingle Bells\" so I can save money for some Shangri-La club no one wants to go to?Not in my experience.Anyway -- it's time to grow up. You know? This is what I'm doing. If you had a problem, I wish you would've said something earlier, before I signed on the dotted line.This is the dream!Guys like me go their whole lives and never do anything that's liked. I'm finally doing something that people enjoy. What is wrong with that?You're an actress, who are you to talk??Maybe you liked me more when I was a failure because it made you feel better about yourself.No.Wait --...Tonight?I thought that was next Thursday.Mia!I'm sorry --I'm -- I'm sorry I missed it -- and I'm sorry I was a dick and I -- I promise I'll make it up to you --...What do you mean?You didn't embarrass yourself... Revision 65....This is home.Oh God, I didn't see them.You look beautiful. I hope it was ok. I haven't played in a while.Yes ma'am....You still think New York?What...?Wrong number.Yeah, well...not anymore.I won't.\"Casting\"...? Revision 68.Because I have good news.Amy Brandt. The casting director.She was at your play. And she loved it. And she loved it so much that she wants you to come audition for a huge movie she's got....Excuse me?That's it?So you're happy here?Why won't you come?I don't buy it.Because what?Yes you are.Why?Why don't you want to do it anymore?I told them you'd be there at five-thirty tomorrow. I'll swing by here before I drive back at eight. Either you'll be outside or you won't.The house across from the library.When do you find out?You're going to get it.You are. I know these things.Griffith Park.I know... I don't know.I don't think we can do anything. Because when you get this --When you get this -- you've got to give it everything you've got.It's your dream.I've got to follow my own plan. Stay here. Get my own thing going. You know...You're going to be in Paris. Good jazz there. And you love jazz now.Right?I guess we're just going to have to wait and see.I'm always going to love you too.Look at this view.Agreed.Alright, I'm done. Harris did a nice job with it.No one touches the instruments. Carson's coming an hour early to test levels.How'd we do last month?Not too bad is great. See you tonight.Hothouse Eddie -- miss me?Yeah?
