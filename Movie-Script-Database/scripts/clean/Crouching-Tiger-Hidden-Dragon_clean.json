{"Crouching-Tiger-Hidden-Dragon": {"YU": {"raw_line": "Mu Bai...It's been too long.Good. And how are you?Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain. He said you were practicing deep meditation.The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you. My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.Why? You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.You were enlightened?What was it?We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.The Green Destiny Sword? You're giving it to Sir Te?I don't understand. How can you part with it? It has always been with you.You use it justly, you're worthy of it.So what will you do now?Come with me to Peking. You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.Join me once you have finished. I can wait for you in Peking.Thanks. Let's go into the city.Just doing my job.Thank you.Sir Te! It has brought him as much trouble as glory. Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me. Please accept our thanks.Please, Sir Te, what is it?I don't know...I beg your pardon. Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.The handle is heavy. And the blade is no ordinary metal. Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.Beautiful but dangerous. Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire. It's 400 years old.My friend Li Mu Bai. He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.You're too young to understand.Yes, I am. But I prefer the machete. Certain moves, however, call for a sword.Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.Sure. No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?So I heard. Congratulations. It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?What do you think?You're probably right.Return the sword, and I'll let you go.You've been trained at Wudan?Get down here! Give back the sword!Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?But the sword could be in his compound.How so?You're doing calligraphy?I never realized my name looks like \"sword.\"You write gracefully. Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.Thank you for seeing me. I hear your wedding day is near. You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.Do you think so? Let me tell you a story.Yes. Did you know I was once engaged to be married?His name was Meng Si Zhao. He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy. After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together. Our feelings for each other grew stronger. But how could we dishonor Meng's memory? So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it. But I have never tasted it.I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.But something is going on at the Yu household.You always suspected she'd fled to the West.Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?Be careful. Sir Te requires discretion. Official business is difficult enough. Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.No.It was Bo, Sir Te's man. I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.No, not yet...No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.What do you mean? Didn't you come back here for it?Then, why did you come?I'd bet my life on it!We must be careful. Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security. Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him. It might get Sir Te in trouble.Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs.I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.Yes. The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master. Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.Yes, from the West. He went undercover and and followed her here,I doubt it. This thief... it very unusual......And most likely smarter than a mere killer.The sword is back... are you happy?But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone. I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.I knew she would intrigue you.She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us. In any case, it will all be over soon. You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.But Wudan does not accept women.It's not our affair. Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.I wish there were something more I could do to help you.You think Jade Fox will show up?Come with me! Hurry!You thought she'd give it all up and go back West with you?Don't you want to see her again.Have some tea.Not everything is an illusion. My hand... wasn't that real?To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.Her husband.What about you?Not a bad idea. Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.It's you! How's everything here?Yes, and I leave again tomorrow. Your wife was due?Good!Mrs. Wu...How's the arm? Still sore?Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.Here you must be in proper attire.I'll give them to you.Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like. If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice. You can run from marriage, but not your parents.Go back to them first. Then you can decide about Lo.He really loves you. Come back to Peking with me. We'll find a solution.Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.How dare you accuse us? I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family. And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt. Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him. We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!Put the sword down!Jen!Everyone out. Shut the doors.Fine... the friendship is over.Don't touch it! That's Li Mu Bai's sword.Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.Give me the sword.I didn't have the heart.What happened?We followed Jade Fox.A poisoned needle!You can't die! Tell us what poison you used! You can't die! Tell us the antidote! You can't let Li Mu Bai die!That can't be! Everything has an antithesis! Why not this?Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu. She'll help you. Hurry!Mu Bai, hold on. Give me some hope...Save your strength.Use it to meditate. Free yourself from this world as you have been taught. Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath. Do not waste it... for me.Bo... please take this sword back to Sir Te.Now you must go to Wudan Mountain. Lo awaits you there. Promise me one thing, whatever path you take in this life... be true to yourself.", "clean_line": "mu bai long good monk zheng said wudan mountain said practicing deep meditation mountain peaceful envy work keeps busy hardly rest wudan fighter training enlightened preparing convoy delivery peking green destiny sword giving sir te understand use justly worthy come peking sword sir te ll like old times join finished wait peking thanks let city job thank sir te brought trouble glory help leave troubles ll able start anew ve good li mu bai accept thanks sir te know beg pardon li mu bai aren cowards handle heavy blade ordinary metal sword lightest weapons handling beautiful dangerous tainted blood beauty hard admire years old friend li mu bai given sir te gift young understand yes prefer machete certain moves sword fighters rules friendship trust integrity rules wouldn survive long writers wouldn sell books told sure place bathe days sleeping flea infested beds tell books heard congratulations important step woman life isn think probably right return sword ll let ve trained wudan sword governor yu seen sword sword compound calligraphy realized looks like sword write gracefully calligraphy similar fencing thank seeing hear wedding day near overwhelmed preparations fornuate marry noble family think let tell story yes know engaged married meng si zhao brother li mu bai oath day battle killed sword li mu bai enemy li mu bai went lot feelings grew stronger dishonor meng memory freedom talk desire tasted aristocrat respect woman duties sister let wish happiness marriage going yu household suspected fled west place safer nose governor yu careful sir te requires discretion official business difficult let personal feelings worse know poster sort trap bo sir te man hear followed thief yus sent home blame losing sword trust ll soon methods mean come come bet life careful governor yu court official charge security disturbance cast suspicion sir te trouble sir te excuse invite madam yu daughter best way trap fox cubs sorry feeling receive today know stole missing item thief returns sure sir te pursue matter sir te knows meaning people mistakes bring ruin families mercy shown murderer turned peking yes killer li mu bai master night killed policeman tracked yes west went undercover followed doubt thief unusual likely smarter mere killer sword happy sword anymore gave sir te job sword embarassing wasn ruin life father knew intrigue aristocrat daughter case soon ll kill fox ll marry wudan accept women affair wudan accepts husband object wish help think jade fox come hurry thought west want tea illusion hand wasn real repress feelings makes stronger husband bad idea tonight ll good night sleep headquarters yes leave tomorrow wife good mrs wu arm sore li mu bai coming stay night proper attire ll look trouble ve caused know giang hu life like think sister let sisterly advice run marriage parents decide lo loves come peking ll solution li mu bai arrangements sent wudan mountain dare accuse knew stolen sword ve protect family repaid contempt li mu bai spared insult wanted peace ve ruined sister sword jen shut doors fine friendship touch li mu bai sword green destiny sword heart happened followed jade fox poisoned needle die tell poison die tell antidote let li mu bai die antithesis horse compound mrs wu ll help hurry mu bai hold hope save strength use meditate free world taught let soul rise eternity breath waste bo sword sir te wudan mountain lo awaits promise thing path life true"}, "JEN": {"raw_line": "I'm your guest today. I am Governor Yu's daughter.I was looking for a quiet corner.It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!But I have had much practice. As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us. They'd let me play with their weapons. The scabbard is so beautiful.Exquisite! You said it belongs to...Li Mu Bai! The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?You're a sword fighter too?Really?It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!But you're just like the characters in the stories.You know what I mean. I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.You're not married, are you?No! You couldn't roam around freely if you were.Please sit.Put them down.Do you know her?I'll socialize with whomever I please.I'm tired now.It will be just the same. Enough! I'm tired.Show her in.I have a guest.I've missed you.I'm bored.I'll write your name. Just for fun.Maybe it is. I wouldn't know.Please.I'm hardly doing a thing. The less I think of it the better. My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.Am I? I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read. Like you and Li Mu Bai. I guess I'm happy to be marrying. But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.About you and Li Mu Bai?No, really?Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.Don't distance us. From now on, let's be like sisters.You say she killed a policeman?Greetings, Sir Te.Why are you still here? You killed a policeman. You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.I'll never live as a thief!That was just for fun. How can I leave? Where would I go?Shut up!I owe you nothing.You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain. You know... you've gone as far as you can go. I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10. You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu. But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened! Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.Lo?You shouldn't have come.You've been looking for me all this time?I won't break it.Give it back!My comb!You coward!It's mine. It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.Give me back my comb.Give it back.And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit. He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.Let them look.Don't send me back!Keep it safe. Return it to me when we are together again.If you don't, I'll come after you. And I won't let you off so easy.Go.Don't ever come back.Yes.It was just a cat.The cup is dirty.Long.Anywhere there's action.Don't bother.So what if I don't?He is my defeated foe!I want a clean room.Steamed whole cod, bite-size meatballs, a little starchy, but keep the sauce light, shark fin soup, mixed vegetables, and some warm wine.Hurry then.What kind of Iron Arm are you?Southern Duck? I don't eat anything with two feet. Who could remember such long-winded names?Who are you?Gou? I hate that name. It makes me puke! Too bad you're named Gou. You'll be the first to feel my sword today.A monk, in a place like this? You need a lesson!Who am I? I am... I am the Invincible Sword Goddess. Armed with the Incredible... Green Destiny. Be you Li or Southern Crane... lower your head... and ask for mercy. I am the desert dragon. I leave no trace. Today I fly over Eu-Mei. Tomorrow... I'll kick over Wudan Mountain!Sister Shu Lien...I'm just borrowing some clean clothes. I'm not staying.I was just passing by and wondered how you were.You, sister...They forced me to marry!You know about Lo?Where is he now?You're working together to set me up! I'm leaving!What do I care? You were never a real friend anyway. But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?Come and get it if you can.Don't be a sore loser. Go ahead. Take your pick. I'll wait. Go ahead.Take it!Not another lecture! On guard!Only the sword will settle this.What do you know about a true heart?What do you want?All right. If you can take back the sword in three moves, I'll go with you.Give it back!Never!Is it me or the sword you want?She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison. It goes straight to the heart.The antidote exists. She taught it to me. The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare. Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.Spare your energy.
