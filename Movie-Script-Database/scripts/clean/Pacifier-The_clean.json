Tell you what -- let's start over. From now on, you listen to me, and do what I say. And I... I'll listen to you too. Deal? Truce -- okay?C'mon c'mon c'mon...Mrs. Plummer... two men tried to get into the house tonight.No - it's okay. They're gone, everyone's fine. They were looking for GHOST, but they didn't find it.

So, she wrecked a driver's Ed. car -- she'll pay for the damage...Red two? I mean Todd?Has he been skipping class?He's not a NAZI.I'll talk to him.Another time, maybe...Did you kick me in the back? Is there a footprint on my jacket?Wait Todd, I want to talk to you...Smart kid.Zoe, you're in charge. If anyone gets within forty clicks of the perimeter, signal me. Keep all doors sealed, do your homework, preheat the oven, and make sure Lulu brushes her teeth!You want in or out?No. My hands are freezing.AT EASE. Would you listen, just once? Look, I don't know a hell of a lot about this kinda stuff, but... You're good. A lot to learn, but with hard work, discipline -- you could make a go of this.That guy's an idiot.\"Sound of Music\" is a great show. My dad took me to see it when I was a kid.Come on. Julie Andrews was hot.You know what girls think is weird? Wrestling. Men in leotards pinning each other to the floor? I've never understood that. Chicks dig guys who can dance.COMPANY -- CENTER STAGE!DO YOU, OR DO YOU NOT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO PERFORM THIS MUSICAL?No director? I have directed rescue missions in Afghanistan! I've directed numerous snatch and grabs in countries who's names you are not allowed to know. I have choreographed multi-pronged amphibious landings and stealth air attacks! Do you think I have the stomach to whip this production into shape, or not?YES WHAT?... What's up?I don't see what you see in this guy.It won't happen again.Okay. I promise. I won't touch him.Okay. Let's see. Once there was a family of Elves.One day, the little Elf family -- Uh. Went into the magic forest. To find a secret gnome... facility, where gnomes where turning mushrooms into... Uranium. The elves had to go in and take it out.They were ordered to. By the Elf Unit commander at Elf station bravo. So -- they waited for cloud cover, and they came in from the north...The Elf Team decided on an L Ambush -- so three elves formed a base leg and laid down a heavy suppressive fire on the gnomes while the others maneuvered around to the right flank and walked through finishing off anything left alive... I mean standing... D ISSOLVE TO:... And not one Elf got left behind that day. We got `em all. Even, the teeniest little elf of all -- Rodriquez.Oh, c'mon... I can't remember that thing.When you're down and low, lower than the floor. And you ain't got a chance. Don't make a move `til you're in the groove, and do the Panda Dance...Just hop three times like a kangaroo -- Sidestep twice, just like the crabs do.Take three steps forward and one step back...What are you looking at?Today you drive.Exactly.ot in a car, no... but it's a lot like a Bradley Assault Vehicle.Do you know what causes most accidents? ttention span. The most important thing is that you keep an absolute focus on...THE ROAD! Don't look at me...No. Keep going. I trust you.Good. Next lesson, 1500 hours.I know 437 ways to hurt a man without touching him. Broken promises lead to broken legs. Do we understand each other?Wow. I'm glad I never had you for a CO.Thanks.You look nice today.You said you wanted to wrestle. You win. Let's do it.I'll be sure to lock up when I'm through.Dislocated nerve, that's all. He'll be fine in two months.Let's go, Todd. I got my troops waiting.If you're ever lost in the woods, the first thing you have to do is find a source of drinking water! And make sure it's potable. If you're not sure, boil it for thirty minutes!You have to eat, right? Well let me tell you you're not gonna find Girl Scout cookies out here.No brownies either. A lot of roots are edible. So is some tree bark. When I HALO'd into Rwanda, I lived off the underground fern stem for three weeks!Insects. They look nasty but they're full of nutrients that may save your life.Wots of pwotien!Okay -- we'll put Von Trapps here, here, and... here at the top of the stairs. Now the Nazis are gonna come in, this way -- and the Von Trapp is set...Why don't we just let the Nazis win tonight -- huh? Now. From the top -- think of yourself as a gazelle prancing over the plains. Graceful.Gazelle. Prancing. Graceful. Again.Don't touch that dial sleep for a while -- HEAAAY! And say good night, Peter Panda.Good night, Peter.I'm not your daddy, Peter. But sweet dreams.That's my troop.Sound off!It's all in the wrist...What's wrong... Scott?How long you been together?That's longer than any relationship I've ever had.Hey. Your father cared about you very deeply. He told me you were the greatest things in his life. That what's bothering you? Cause -- we can talk about it, if you want.This was my dad's. He was the only family I ever had. Mom left when I was little, cause dad was always gone. Two years in... an indisclosable locale. Another six in... Another indisclosable locale. I didn't really have a home, so I went to military school -- then one day my mom got the letter. No more dad.I always wanted to be just like him. I'm starting to realize, I never really knew him. I don't know if I'm like him or not.The hardest part was living without any details...why? How? Where? I always wondered if he thought about me.You could say I just shut down my emotions. I turned off all feelings and dedicated myself to becoming the perfect soldier.Just another assignment. No reason for personal attachments.Hey Gary, your wings aren't clipped. How come you don't fly away?I guess you've got it good. Kids to play with. Three squares a day.All quiet on the western front. I guess I better fix that Playroom window. hane rises.What happened, Gary?What do you suppose this is?Sir! Excellent news. I think I found GHOST.No. It's in a steel vault. I've been trying all night, can't crack it, sir.One things for sure. After we turn this in to my CO, whoever's been bothering you guys won't be bothering you anymore.What's wrong, Lulu? You should be happy.You guys better get ready. Your mom should be home soon.Captain.That's kind of you, Sir... pause) But I'll have to think about it.Sir, all I've never known is the military. At nine years old my father put me in cadet school and from there I never looked back. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't trade it for anything and I have no regrets...But being with these kids has made me feel like there's more to life than taking out your enemy. And I think I want to explore that some more.Mr. and Mrs. Chun? They checked out-NOW!Bill, don't hurt the kids.I know the code. I'll get you in... just please don't hurt anyone.Anybody got any perfume? Hair spray... breath freshener...Zoe, Todd, Lulu, Peter, Tyler!The key is the kid's names. Watch.But... That was the code! I swear! I saw Plummer use it on his briefcase.Haven't got a chance.... When you're down and low, lower than the floor. And you haven't got a chance. Don't make a move `til you're in the groove, and do the Peter Panda Dance.Just hop three times like a kangaroo --Sidestep twice, just like the crabs do.Three steps forward and one step back.Wriggle like a snake `til you can't no more. Then better jump quick, like there ain't no floor.Almost done, almost done... \"Just hold your breath, and jump to the left.\"And that's the Peter Panda Dance.I was devoted to you, sir. And you betrayed all of that. All that we stand for.There will be no mercy.You're a... terrible neighbor.... Say, good night, Peter Panda!... GHOST.Whoa, WHOA! What are you doing to these kids??These kids are heroes. They just aided in exposing a high-level espionage ring. I suggest you call the FBI. Now.Just doing my job.Well. I'm kinda, re-conning the situation, here... And to tell the truth. I don't see anything but reasons to stay.... I don't know. I'm on dry land. You're the superior office. You tell me.Sir yes sir.Ah, come here you.He would've wanted me to give it to someone I care about. Like he did. Thank you. For everything.Your dad would be so proud.What are you talking about? I'm gonna see you Friday night.Tonight is the night we trained for, and failure is not an option! No detail is too small! We are the BEST! Remember your lines, hit your marks, and stay in character!
