Sure.Will I what?Now?I was kind of thinking the same thing.Hey, it's okay. I've been called worse.Sometimes I feel like everybody in the world saw that game. Like I could go to India and some little guy would run up to me and say, 'Boy, did you suck inSo, how come you're such a fan?Scared? Well... yes. Absolutely.Well, thank you.

Bookends.These are my guests.Why did you do that?That's what I was hoping.I guess they found one.What is it?Oh, God. I've got to go to the bathroom. It's far away, isn't it?Oh, man.

No. I'm here because ... I don't want to be alone.But to tell you the truth... I'm kind of scared of you.You know what hurtsTheir defensive end punched me in the mouth.Seriously. It's killing me.... after that game, after being beaten that badly in front of the whole country, after humiliating myself, my team, my school, my family, I mean -- did you know that I set two Sugar Bowl records?! I was sacked eleven times! I threw six interceptions!Anyway, after that, I could never seem to adjust in the pros. I was too scared. I lost my balls.You know what I mean. My nerve. I lost the edge you need to play this game.No. Somehow, I convinced myself that I couldn't ever win the big game. I got so down, that I was afraid to be playing when a game was on the line. I was afraid to screw up. That's the sure sign of a loser. From there, it wasn't very far to thinking that I'll never win, that I didn't deserve to win at anything. Including love.What's this?A visit. Who let you in?Lucky girl.Dallas Cowboys. Howdy.What do you want?I'm flattered that you actually think we have a chance to win.Is the union behind this 'visit'?I won't go out with herWhatever you say, Coach.Hut!

And I'm sorry. But now I want to go out there and either beat these bastards or die trying. I never wanted to beat anybody so bad in my life.Gentlemen, our problem is the Cowboys aren't afraid of us. But they should be!We've got one chance on offense to make our stand -- the first play of the half.No. But one nasty-ass play might. We just gotta be brave. And trust each other.Help me with this.Somebody has to tape me up.I'm okay. I owe you an apology.Yes. I'll explain later. But thank you for believing in me. You give me strength just looking at you.Suck my dick.Blue thirteen! Blue thirteen! Hut! Hut! Hut!Okay, everybody, stickBlack 98! Black 98! Hut!Hut! Hut!Put your tits on my head...I can do it.Just make it a good snap. And you'll do the rest, right?Lou, are you alright?What?!Hut!What would Unitas do in this situation? I have no idea.No problem, Mickey. Hell of a hit, Reese.Right after this play. So besides me, who really wants the ball?Yeah. You want it, Brian. Let's hook up. Blue left slot open 'A' right.
