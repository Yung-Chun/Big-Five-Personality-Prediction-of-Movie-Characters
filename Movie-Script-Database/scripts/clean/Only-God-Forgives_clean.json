{"Only-God-Forgives": {"JULIAN": {"raw_line": "Two fifty, three hundred...You did well out there. You've got something, Liang. Potential, yeah?Don't spend it all in once place.He still in there?You told him I was coming...Well maybe you didn't try hard enough. The Lizard takes the handkerchief away from his nose. Shows the bloodstain to Julian.When was the last time you slept? The Lizard smiles but stares at Julian with hatred in his eyes.No.You know where he is now? The Lizard stares at Julian.You go. I'm gonna look around. See if I can find him.Go on. He turns back to The Lizard.Which way'd he go? The Lizard nods his head towards the busy street. Julian turns and heads off... Gordon steps up to the entrance to the club. The Lizard sticks out an arm, blocking his way.You seen Billy?Well if he comes in, tell him I'm looking for him, yeah?Yeah, well... if you see him, tell him I'm looking for him... Ma Long nods as she takes the money. Julian is about to leave. He looks at the pretty prostitute again. Stares at her for a moment. Then walks out.Julian's not here mate. Fuck off... Beat - then we hear a voice from behind the door.What is it?I can't deal with my brother right now... Beat.What? No answer. Finally Julian gets up and wraps a towel around his body and slowly opens the door. Gordon stands in the hallway - behind him two Thai men from Julian's crew.What happened?Someone killed Billy... The camera ZOOMS IN on Mai.For now... We wait. Julian glances back at the body...Hello Mum. Beat.It's me... Julian... Something's happened.Maybe. Take your pick. Billy wasn't popular.You know Billy... He was eccentric. Jenna smiles to herself as if this brings back memories and Julian even smiles. Both sit in silence for a moment.I'll make sure it gets done.Yeah, okay, I'll do it.Ask him if he's Choi Yan Lee. At the mention of his name the colour drains from Choi Yan Lee's face. His eyes lock with Julian's.Ask him why he killed my brother.What's he saying? Beat.Who did that to him? Choi Yan Lee looks at the various faces that surround him - then stares directly at Julian.What's he saying?Tell me.How does he do that?Ask him who cut his hand off. Charlie Ling's reluctant to question him further. Julian insists.Do it.What's he saying?What did he say? Charlie Ling considers Choi Yan Lee. Realizes he's not going to get a better answer out of him...Nothing... We're not going to do anything... Just leave him. Leave them all.It's a little bit more complicated than that Mum.Mum, calm down...I know, you always say that - but this is different...Maybe... Maybe Billy had it coming......because of what he did. Jenna thinks it over for a moment.Why?What if... What if it was The Angel of Vengeance? Jenna stares at her son like he's finally lost the plot....it - or he - restores karma and order in the world.He loves all humans...I'm not, I'm just... Julian can't get the words out. He gets up.... I've got to go. ...and Julian leaves - letting the door to the office stay open. We pick up the sounds of the fighters training outside as we slowly ZOOM IN on Jenna. She turns to Gordon.It's alright... He drinks his drink. Silence...Nothing. Mai looks around the bar... It's half empty - some girls and men spread out. The waitress comes over and Mai orders a drink. They sit in silence, listening to the song...Nothing...I want you to meet my Mum. A pause, Mai slightly taken about.To show her... To show that I've got something here...When did you last see him?Did he have any enemies?Who?This his phone? Liang's Sister nods. Julian scrolls through the numbers. All have Thai names against them - except one. Julian considers the number, then redials. A beat. Then the SOUND of a phone ringing in the same room. Gordon looks round. Realises he's busted. Takes his phone out. Kills it. Julian stares at him. Before he gets a chance to say anything, there is a knock on the door.What is it?No, I'll talk to them.Good morning officers. How can I help you? Slowly Chang turns to face him. Julian stares at him as if he's in a trance...Never heard of him.I run a boxing club. Not much call for one armed men. A beat. Mexican stand off.What's this got to do with me?Then I guess you boys have got a lot of work to do - so have I, so if you'll excuse me...Sure, sorry. What do you want to know? Julian looks over to Chang who continues staring at the boxers. The way the ring is lit he's almost silhouetted.With my mum... Some of the boxers come over to Chang. They know him. They're reverential. With the effect of the lighting, it seems to Julian like they're bowing down before a God.You want to speak to her?Am I suspect? Chang turns round to face Julian. His presence is magnetic. Julian stares back at him, realizing that this must be the Angel of Vengeance... Chang walks over to them. Studies Julian for a long moment and then turns to Kim.I want you to find out who that guy is. Okay?Now. The SOUND of Nadee singing 'LONELY COMING DOWN' by Dolly Parton.You're him... Aren't you?The one who killed my brother. Chang says nothing for a long time.I came here to kill you.I don't know...Yes.Cause, all my life... I don't know.My mother wants me to kill you. Chang stares back at him.... I love violence.Thai style.You can't wear that.My mother's... Very particular about colours.She hates red. Come on, we'll get you something else. Mai stares at him, reluctant to give in.Come on.Look, I'm telling you. It's easier this way. Trust me. Mai gives in. Takes his hand.It's Mai, Mum.A year and a half isn't it? Beat as Mai quickly counts in her head...Mum, please...I saw her walking down the street. Jenna raises an eyebrow...And I thought - this is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen - so I just walked up to her and started talking.Mum, stop it, for fuck's sake.Leave her alone Mum. You've got her wrong. She's a good girl.Mum! A pause.The cops came by my club today. Beat. She stares at him.They're investigating a murder. The guy that killed Billy turned up dead this morning. Jenna looks bored. Lights a cigarette.I know it was you, Mum.He was there. He was with them.The Angel of Vengeance.No.I'm not going to kill him...This isn't about Billy. This is about me. All my life I've been running...- his name is Chang-Mum, don't talk to her like that. Mai sits down.Me. Jenna calms down. She looks at their reflections in the mirror behind the bar. We ZOOM in on the mirror, their faces refracted by the glass.Billy was a fuck up... He deserved everything he got. You know it and I know it.Yeah we were brothers, but we were never close... And he was only in Bangkok cause you couldn't control him. So you sent him to me---- So you sent him to me and what could I do?I did what I could. And that's more than you ever did.And what did that get him? I'll tell you what, a one way ticket to this fucking place, just like me.I'm only here 'cause of you. If you didn't exist, I wouldn't be here. Beat.I could've been someone, Mum. I was on my way... Jenna stares at him - this is a conversation she does not like having...Don't you think I know that? And look at me now. I'm a front for a drugs smuggling. He turns to Mai.It's true... The whole thing's a front. Every day I see kids coming in with great potential. And every day I see kilos of heroin going out. And it's all because of you, Ma. You and the money and the drugs. Jenna silently seethes, waiting for Julian to shut the fuck up. He quietens down...That's right Mum. That's what's more important to you. But what about me? Sometimes I think you only got me out of there so the cops couldn't trace it back to you... Jenna stares at him. Her face a mask....that's right Mum. Think about it. With me gone you were safe. And it turned out to be good for business as well. All very convenient. Silence between them. Jenna lights another cigarette - her hands now shaking.Is that what happened with Billy? Did Billy become a problem like I did? Wouldn't surprise me, he was a big fucking problem when he was here... Still, at least you didn't have him killed. Jenna slaps him hard on the face. Julian recovers. Looks up at her. Very intense.I'm not going to kill him for you, Mum. Doesn't matter what you say. And do you want to know why?'Cause I'm going to fight him. In the ring. Me versus him.I don't expect you to understand. Cause you don't understand anything that isn't about you.I don't know... But maybe this time I'll win. Like you say, only God forgives. Maybe this time he'll forgive me... Jenna turns to Mai.You never did, Mum. A pause. Julian's touched a nerve. Jenna recovers.I'm fine. Beat.I'll be fine. In a minute. Julian wipes his face clean. Pulls himself together.Sorry about that.Seeing when it hurts. Mai watches him. He doesn't flinch.Didn't you like what I got you?What do you mean?Don't to be so hard on her. Her life hasn't been easy.Don't say that, okay? You don't know what you're talking about. She'd do anything for me.Don't go there.You don't get to judge her. You think she's bad? You should've met my dad. But he's not around anymore, and do you know why? Cause she loved me too much. He lets go of her neck. Mai rubs her neck.How much do I owe you? He forces a roll of notes into her hand, forcing her to take it.Come on. Chang retreats. Shrugs at Julian. You come on. Julian moves towards him, but before he gets a chance to take out his frustrations, the bell goes. End of round one. Julian stalks back to his corner. He turns to look at Chang, a look of intense anger and frustration.What are you talking about?Give it a break mum. Just... give it as rest. He steps into the light. She reaches out to touch him.Yeah, well I lost.... No... it didn't make a difference... No difference at all.Nothing. I don't feel anything at all.What do you want, Mum? Beat.What's wrong Mum? She shakes her head. Can't say it.What's wrong?Who does? Beat. Jenna says nothing. Julian thinks... Cogs turn...Chang? Jenna nods.What did you do, Mum? What did you do? Jenna makes her hand into a pistol. Pretends to fire it into her skull. She tried to have Chang killed. Julian's speechless.We'll be okay - I'll do it, I'll take him out...We're outside.I need you here. Right now.Okay. Julian kills his phone. He's still for a moment, then:Let's make a move.What's it say? Charlie starts reading the article out:The Angel Of Vengeance.No way.Who said? Beat.My mother? Charlie Ling nods.What kind of a mother says that?No. We're not doing it.Only God forgives. And now mother - you will die... He rings the bell, raising the shotgun, ready to shoot. The doorWhere's is she?I'm so fucked...... Yeah.What did she say? What did she promise you?I've got to get out of Bangkok. Didn't want to leave... He winces.... without saying goodbye.My mother... She made me what I am. And now I've got nothing. And they're after me. Mai stares at him.I got about twelve grand at the club... Should be enough to get us there. Set ourselves up. Disappear...Right now. Mai looks around - they're alone.Stay here. If I'm not out in five minutes... Go. Mai nods.I'm sorry...Don't hurt her. He kicks him in the stomach.I'm sorry... Chang kicks him again - like you would kick a dog... Juilan groans. Chang squats down next to him.I don't know... I'm sorry. Chang gets up and walks on. He stops and turns round.Dark... Darkness. Chang looks at him in a strange way - like this answer has some meaning for him.No... Never. Chang considers this answer for a long moment. He gets up and returns to Mai - stares at her....", "clean_line": "ve got liang potential yeah spend place told coming maybe try hard lizard takes handkerchief away nose shows bloodstain julian time

"JENNA": {"raw_line": "I'd like to check in now please. The Concierge checks the computer.I'd like to speak to your manager. Beat.Listen to me... I've just travelled six thousand miles to see the corpse of my first born son and I haven't slept for thirty hours and he says I can't go to my room. The Manager just stares at her but is clearly taken back by her force...How much?...Fuck off you cunt, just hand me the fucking key... She lays the money on the desk. The manager looks around...Don't leave the money there. Some cunt'll nick it. Put it in your pocket. The Manager hesitates.Put it in your pocket.Put it in your fucking pocket. The Manager takes the money. Pockets it. Places the key on the desk.Hey... Open this. Jenna points to the Duty Free bag then starts running a bath, beginning to undress.I need a drink. The Porter is stunned.Well don't just stand there... The Porter fumbles, taking the gin out of the Duty Free bag, spilling the tonic in his nervousness as he makes her cocktail. Jenna returns in a dressing gown, takes the drink off him and takes a huge slug. The Porter is terrified, stunned. Rooted to the spot. Jenna sits on the bed and stares out of the window. Just as the Porter thinks it's safe to try edging out of the room again, she starts talking to him...I loved him so much you know... Billy... Beat. The Porter doesn't know what the fuck she's talking about.Everyone loves their children don't they? Well, not everyone, but... She looks over at him. The Porter smiles at her.Do you want to see a picture? The Porter nods, uncertain. Jenna gets up, goes over to her purse. Opens it up. A picture of Billy. She hands it to the Porter - who takes it and just looks at it, not knowing what to do... Jenna starts to cry. For a long time. Finally...What, yeah, thanks. She pulls a fifty dollar bill out of her purse. She hands the money to the Porter who leaves as quickly as he dares.It's me...I'm in Bangkok...I needed to be by myself...Raise Hell... Julian turns his back to the window.Could it be have been one of the gangs?What do you mean?But you're going to find out who did it, right?No, it needs to be you that does it. We need to show them. Do you understand what I'm saying?Good. HOLD ON Julian as we bring up the SOUND of Johnny Cash's Ring of Fire.Did you kill him? Beat. A shared look between Gordon and Julian.Complicated? He killed my son... What's so fucking complicated about that?Don't tell me to calm down. I want him dead. Beat... Julian does not know how to explain the situation. Jenna stares at him.We don't forgive. Only God does.How? Silence. Julian doesn't know how to answer. Jenna watches him carefully...What are you talking about?I don't care.Just don't - some Thai cunt murdered your brother and we're not going to let him get away with it.The Angel of fucking what...?'Restores' things? Who said anything about 'restoring' things? Beat.I don't know what kind of spiritual journey you're on, but you will killHow's business?What d'you mean?I'm here. Julian's here. Gordon shrugs. Jenna clocks it.What's gotten into him...? Is he high or something?Nothing?Not like you... Gordon smiles at her uncertainly.So tell me... What did he mean when he said it was complicated?So we kill them both.Okay. Well how about we start with the guy we do know?So... May, isn't it?How long have you two known each other then? Mai's about to answer but Juilan gets there first.Well it's always a rare treat to meet one of Julian's lady friends.So, where did you two meet?I hear that happens a lot in this part of the world... Tell me, what's your line of work, Mai?I bet you do. But tell me Mai, before you started serving my son, how many cocks were you serving? Was it over a thousand? Mai stares at Jenna in disbelief.I know girls like you. Just because you might be pulling the wool over my son's eyes don't think it's going to work with me.I'm sorry Julian, but I won't stand by and let a dirty little hooker take advantage of my son in the vain hope that her womb isn't so diseased that she can trick him into impregnating her and putting another cocksucking child on to this earth.What do you know about what's good? Beat. Julian says nothing.Well that's nice isn't it, I'm really happy for you--Oh really, shame that, still, live by the sword, die by the sword...I did what had to be done.Who?D'you kill him?Cause he as good as killed Billy. What I want to know is, what are you going to do about it?Yes you are. You're going to do it for me and you're going to do it for your brother.That's right you cunt, cause you always run away whenever there's a problem... just like you're running away from killing this fucking Angel of whateverChang?! Mai stands up.Sit down you cunt.So what am I left with? Julian stares at her.You're right. We're family. We stick together. But Billy was family too.That's it. I'm not listening to this. I don't ever want to hear you mention his name again... Do you hear me?You could have protected him.I would've done anything for him. Okay, he wasn't born with as many advantages as you were. He struggled with things. But I always stood by him.Don't you dare blame me for what happened back then.You would've been a great fighter... You could've gone pro.At least you're not behind bars and that's more important to me. Julian turns to her - he has been waiting all his life to say this.Surprise me.Well that seems sensible... And what do you hope that's going to achieve?And when you lose, what's going to happen then?Do you understand what he's talking about? 'Cause I haven't got a fucking a clue.I hope you find what you're looking for. 'Cause if you don't, it's going to find you and I'm not always going to be there to look after you. Jenna composes herself. Suddenly brightens. A different person.Nice to meet you Mai. Hope to see you again soon. Jenna shakes her hand. Mai's too shocked to resist. And then, as if nothing had happened, Jenna leaves. Julian covers his face with his napkin.Lovely, yeah. Just catching up, you know. Jenna sits down. Lights a cigarette.You're a piece of work, aren't you? Gordon blushes. Jenna blows out her match.No fucking hanging about with you, is there?I bet you do.We'll have to something about that the, wont we? But, first things first, what about Chang?My son's guardian angel.Good, then he won't be to hard to kill, will he?What did you have in mind? Gordon blushes. Moves closer, conspiratorial...I didn't say it was easy. But then, you're a resourceful man, aren't you?Well then you're going to have to find someone who's not a fucking Thai then, aren't you?Don't you worry about that. There are certain things that a mother and son shouldn't - and don't - discuss... Gordon thinks he does but isn't a hundred per cent sure.You really want to know?He killed my son.This is Bangkok. Nothing's that expensive.He doesn't want to see anyone. Mai is disappointed. Doesn't know what to say.Just give him time...Of course. Jenna hugs Mai close.We'll get him through this together.You deserved to win. You should'veI'll never get use to seeing you get hurt - even when you win.And did it make a difference? Julian says nothing.I want to know... Did it make a difference? Slowly he shakes his head.And how do you feel now?Don't you see, that's how I felt when Billy died... Julian studies his mother.What d'you think I want? I want it to be like it used to be... I don't want to lose you... Jenna starts crying. Could be real, could be an act - hard to tell she's so good...He knows... He knows it was me.He's going to come after me. And after he's come after me, he's going to come after you. Julian stares at his mother; fragile, terrified, alone.I'm scared, Julian. Julian stares at his mother.What are we going to do? Julian begins to realize what he has to do... and he looks at his hands. Finally...Not just him. We've got to take them all out. Julian stares at her - the power she has over him...Kill them all. The final solution.I came here to collect my son's body. Now it's released, my business in Bangkok is completed.Tonight.I've had no real contact with Julian since he ran away.I watched him lose. And he deserved to. You were the better fighter. My only sadness is that Billy got caught up in what he's doing out here. And paid for it with his life. Kim and the rest of the crew take this in.I'll never testify against my own flesh and blood, Officer Chang. But he's a killer. Chang senses something. Starts to become agitated.... It pains me to say it, but my own son is a killer. He killed a cop back in England ten years ago. He's been on the run ever since. I say son... But he hasn't been a son to me. Chang stares at the door to the bedroom. Feels the presence of someone the other side of the door.Not for a long time. Not since he killed that cop back home... That was ten years ago. He's been running ever since. And he'll never stop until he's caught. Until you catch him. Chang starts to push the door open... Behind him Jenna stands up. Before Chang fully opens the door, his mobile phone rings. It sounds INCREDIBLY loud. He takes it out and looks at the display with a feeling of dread. He answers...", "clean_line": "like check concierge checks like speak manager beat listen ve travelled thousand miles corpse born son haven slept thirty hours says room manager stares clearly taken force fuck cunt hand fucking key lays money desk manager looks leave money cunt ll nick pocket manager hesitates pocket fucking pocket manager takes money pockets places key desk hey open jenna points duty free bag starts running bath beginning undress need drink porter stunned stand porter fumbles taking gin duty free bag spilling tonic nervousness makes cocktail jenna returns dressing gown takes drink takes huge slug porter terrified stunned rooted spot jenna sits bed stares window porter thinks safe try edging room starts talking loved know billy beat porter know fuck talking loves children looks porter smiles want picture porter nods uncertain jenna gets goes purse opens picture billy hands porter takes looks knowing jenna starts long time finally yeah thanks pulls dollar purse hands money porter leaves quickly dares bangkok needed raise hell julian turns window gangs mean going right needs need understand saying good hold julian bring sound johnny cash ring kill beat shared look gordon julian complicated killed son fucking complicated tell calm want dead beat julian know explain situation jenna stares forgive god silence julian know answer jenna watches carefully talking care thai cunt murdered brother going let away angel fucking restores things said restoring things beat know kind spiritual journey killhow business mean julian gordon shrugs jenna clocks gotten high like gordon smiles uncertainly tell mean said complicated kill okay start guy know isn long known mai answer juilan gets rare treat meet julian lady friends meet hear happens lot world tell line work mai bet tell mai started serving son cocks serving thousand mai stares jenna disbelief know girls like pulling wool son eyes think going work sorry julian won stand let dirty little hooker advantage son vain hope womb isn diseased trick impregnating putting cocksucking child earth know good beat julian says nice isn happy oh shame live sword die sword kill cause good killed billy want know going yes going going brother right cunt cause run away problem like running away killing fucking angel whateverchang mai stands sit cunt left julian stares right family stick billy family listening want hear mention hear protected ve okay wasn born advantages struggled things stood dare blame happened ve great fighter ve gone pro bars important julian turns waiting life surprise sensible hope going achieve lose going happen understand talking cause haven got fucking clue hope looking cause going going look jenna composes suddenly brightens different person nice meet mai hope soon jenna shakes hand mai shocked resist happened jenna leaves julian covers face napkin lovely yeah catching know jenna sits lights cigarette piece work aren gordon blushes jenna blows match fucking hanging bet ll wont things chang son guardian angel good won hard kill mind gordon blushes moves closer conspiratorial easy resourceful man aren going fucking thai aren worry certain things mother son shouldn discuss gordon thinks isn cent sure want know killed son bangkok expensive want mai disappointed know time course jenna hugs mai close ll deserved win vei ll use seeing hurt win difference julian says want know difference slowly shakes head feel felt billy died julian studies mother think want want like want lose jenna starts crying real act hard tell good knows knows going come come going come julian stares mother fragile terrified scared julian julian stares mother going julian begins realize looks hands finally ve got julian stares power kill final solution came collect son body released business bangkok completed tonight ve real contact julian ran away watched lose deserved better fighter sadness billy got caught paid life kim rest crew ll testify flesh blood officer chang killer chang senses starts agitated pains son killer killed cop england years ago run son hasn son chang stares door bedroom feels presence door long time killed cop home years ago running ll stop caught catch chang starts push door open jenna stands chang fully opens door mobile phone rings sounds incredibly loud takes looks display feeling dread answers"}}}
