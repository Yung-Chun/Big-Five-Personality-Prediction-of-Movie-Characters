{"Fair-Game": {"VALERIE": {"raw_line": "Jessica McDowell. Cognis Chemicals. I hope I'm not late.I fly to Taiwan Tuesday then back to Dusseldorf. I really only need five minutes of his time..Oh I can imagine.Actually. If it's all the same-Well. I'm sure you're aware Mr.. You're aware that recently your subsidiary, Kopa Oleochemicals developed an organic, ester based lubricant derived from Kernel oil, that makes offshore drilling significantly more environmental. My company, Cognis CMBH wants-Canadian. Actually. From Toronto.Right. Uh. No. Not really.Oh I'm a fan. Dad's from Vancouver, so I'm a Canuck. Between us, the Maple Leaves suck. They should never have signed Mark Bell. Guy's a liability on an off the ice. So who's your team?Is that ok? I really don't wish to intrude.Mr. Tabir? Jessica McDowall, Cognis GMBH. Thank you for allowing me to come to your beautiful Home.Mr Tabir I wonder if you had time to glance at our proposal which would allow Kopa to access to Cognis' current Petrochemical Service Partners. Essentially its-Hi. I was waiting for Mr. Tabir.Why are we stopping?But he trusts you, Hafiz..Your car was swept an hour ago. Do not get out. If you get out of this car I can't protect you.Let go of my arm Hafiz. NOW.Listen carefully. Your uncle is in business with Abu Domar Khan-Khan has made contact with a terror organisation via an aid agency in Pakistan. They are seeking materials to build a weapon.Your brother is in Kalutara jail in Colombo facing execution for trafficking. We can help him.You have to think straight here Hafiz. Because I promise you one thing... Right now, you have no idea what we can and cannot do.We need information about your uncle. Contacts. Shipments. If you help us, we help you. If you don't, your brother dies and tomorrow you're sitting next to your uncle in a cell in Thailand and it won't be me asking the questions.You will get a call at 8am. You'll be asked if you need a cleaner. You want her to come three mornings per week. Do you understand? I said DO YOU UNDERSTAND?I work in Venture Capital. Brewster Jennings, here in Georgetown.Right. Retail and consumer.. Basically we create pooled investment vehicles..I guess. But you know..high risk, high return. Pretty boring actually. So what do you do?It's real scary.Joe thinks Disneyland is Vegas for kids.Every time. Every time we go out.He's drunk Joe. Everybody's had a hard day. They're just trying to let off steam-So you can't call him a racist pussy.Who's that?Hello.So who am I?Valerie Plame.Former Ambassador to Gabon. Ambassador in Iraq during the Gulf War. Married twice.. Has a reputation for trouble.I'm an energy consultant for a firm in Brussels.I love it.Didn't I say? She can't get here til after lunch.Are you sure-Hafiz hired a cleaner.What time did he call this in?We have a shipment. A holding company in Pakistan asks Tabir to purchase 200 un-identified units, trackable by part numbers, from..The shipment is delivered to Goza Tech in Secaucus, New Jersey...There it's bundled in with a second shipment of legitimate electronic parts, and documentation attached that masks its point of origin.Sir, we're from U.S customs. Can I take a moment of your time?Does it have other uses?This is a list of other components exported through the same network over the last 3 years. Tilt tables. timing equipment. High speed monitioring devices.I'm not stopping it.We keep the transaction live. Trace it all the way to the end user.The shipment arrives in Joburg on the 21st. It's put in an unmarked container and shipped to the free trade zone in Dubai. Our asset meets there with the buyer on the 23rd.Dr Forster and his team at Los Alamos have altered the impedence timings of the spark gaps by a fraction of a nanosecond. Basically, they won't know it doesn't work til it doesn't work.Too dangerous. This network has avoided detection for years. Expect meticulous operational security and counter surveillance. Any questions?Yes Sir.What about the Dubai op?Manucher Vaziri. Syrian National. Based out of Karachi. On a wire picked up in Cairo he talks about componentry from a known source in Pakistan he's moving to an unnamed Gulf state..Vaziri's devoutly Shia. Iraq's controlled by the Sunni. Saddam's Sunni. There's no way this is Iraq.And Martin Luther King and the KKK are both Christian.Don't fuck up.He's qualified. He's been there hundreds of times. Knows the arena inside out.He's been working hard to build his business. Then there's the twins. Money's kinda tight right now.You want to go out for breakfast. Or stay here?There's something I have to tell you.What are you thinking?Joe?I need to get you cleared.Actually. I work in Georgetown for Brewster Jennings. We're a small firm of Venture Capitalists.It pays the rent.This is Joe Wilson. Joe, this is Mike, the Deputy Chief of CPD. I'll leave you guys to it.I've seen them.When I seized them last year in Jordan. When I headed the covert team that intercepted them, bought back samples and delivered them to you guys at WINPAC.You're right. I'm no nuclear expert. But Dr. Houston Wood, at Virginia U atomic facility is. He also knows Dr Zippe, who's 89 and lives in Austria, and he told him that the wall thickness of the Iraqi tubes was three or four times the thickness of his design.A metal that hasn't been used in gas centrifuges since 1952.Joe. No one is saying you're wrong here. But if you're right, it's huge. So we ask the question. Right? We have to ask the question.They write a report. Give it to the analysts. It'll be re-written, then kicked upstairs where it'll be thrown in with whoever else's report they got-You can't compile Intelligence from a single source? That's not Intelligence. That's an opinion.Say who?What if you're wrong? One guy says it's true. It's not true. Lots of guys say it's true, it's still not true. It's intelligence. It's slow. Painstaking. But it works. Checks and balances.Probably neither. You're a teeny tiny weeny cog in a giant machine. But you did your job. You should feel good. They count on that. That's why they don't pay you.I can get the kids to make you a medal, if it'll help.I'll see what I can do.Why is the OVP here?Mike. The Vice President's men are here.Behind the curve Sir. Most of the intel is outdated. We don't have a single operative or asset in the country.With respect sir, you can't look at this problem from space and make a call.The defectors are unreliable. Most are supplied through a former asset the agency's had on a burn notice since `95. It's a racket. They walk in and get paid to say whatever the Pentagon wants to hear.We need sources we can rely on. We need to get in close.Inside.Thank you.Thank you.Sir, Dr Harper is in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She received a call yesterday requesting she stay home for 48 hours.I'm sorry for misleading you. But I'm here to ask you the same question. Because you are not Professor Aziz.I'm sorry to surprise you like this Sir. Your name is Doctor Harif Al Fallari. You were born in Basra.So you're not Doctor Fallari.You were not lead engineer at the Osirak nuclear installation outside Tikrit. You were never captured by the Mukhbarat escaping to Syria. You didn't spend three years in the Abu Dhan jail.You weren't tortured. Broken. You didn't finally escape and arrive here in Cairo with nothing.Dr. Al Fallari had two daughters. They were taken by Uday Hussein's private guard. He never saw them again.That didn't happen. They never existed.I need names. Of your colleagues in the weapons programmes. The lives of hundreds of thousands of your people may depend upon it.I know Tarif. I know what happened.No. We've got 29 names. I want to get to them all.Maybe.Hey, did I wake you up?I gotta go. I have to be at the airport in forty five minutes.I left a post-it by the lamp. Its all on the post-it.I didn't want to wake you. Are you OK?I'm going to Cleveland.I'll be home tonight. It's on the Post-It.Dr. Al Haddad? Is there somewhere we can speak?How long is it since you saw your brother?Would you like to go back and see him?We need to ask Sa'ad some questions. Do you think he would answer them?We can help your brother. Right now he is extremely valuable to us.He could come here Sawsan. He's an expert physicist. He'd have a job, his children, his family would be safe. You, your daughter could see him whever you want. Sawsan. Can you help us?Then do it for Sa'ad.How do you feel?Just remember, if anyone asks you anything, if anyone stops you stay calm and tell the truth. You're just visiting your brother. Keep it simple and keep to the truth.You have to know. Know why you're lying. And never forget the truth..I'm coming home.You can still smell it.Put on a coat.Don't think Churchill. Think Scott of the Antarctic.I was in Europe on business last week. I missed it.Thank Sue. Bottom cupboard.You're right Sue. Who knows?We need Mike to see this. And Bill.Sawsan's brother worked with five hundred scientists at the Safa factory. In `91 it was blanket bombed by B52s. Hussein Kamel, Saddam's son in law, kept the scientists together, threatening to kill them if they tried to leave. But sanctions destroyed the economy, and when Kamel was executed in `95, the team just drifted apart. They're all say the same thing Mike. Everyone.Bill. Wait up.I gave my word Bill.Hold the elevator please.What the fuck is going on Mike. It's like, if there was a baby on the ledge up on seventh, no-one would get up and save it in case the White House wanted it there.These scientists are the WMD. If we can't protect them, they'll run to the first country who can. And they'll put them to work.Beth! Who do you have in Baghdad? I need to get an RG-17 to an asset in Mansour.I'm asking you.Sa'ad, I know that. We will take care of your family. But we have to move fast.Sa'ad. Do exactly as I say, we won't let you down.Nothing. I'm just tired..I'm fine. Are the kids asleep.OK. I'm going to bed.The CIA's decision to send retired diplomat Joseph C. Wilson to Africa-Wilson never worked for the CIA, but his wife, Valerie Plame..Does this run overseas?Good morning Sir. Ma'am.I've already started a list Sir.Sir, I have several live ops at crucial stages, people in the field in critical windows of operation-Sir, why is Internal security here?Mike. We need to get a message to Baghdad. Sa'ad and his family are being taken to the border today. I have to get word to them.Mike. They're packed and ready. Mike you know what this means.Bill. I have eight, nine teams in the field. We have assets in Kuala Lumpur. Dubai. Mumbai.I need to brief my replacement in the Joint Task Force.I have a critical operation in Baghdad in a major ongoing-Hey guys. Give mommy a kiss.Well, did you say \"Please\"?Wow. That is one cool scarecrow. Don't eat that Sam. It's a crayon. It's icky. Give it to mommy.Don't pick it up. Who've you spoken to? Joe, who have you spoken to?Hello?Lisa. Yes. I read it. Listen- I'm sorry..I can't talk about this. I can't..I can't make a comment on this right now.I have to go. I'm sorry. I'll call you tomorrow.I don't want you to go on TV.I have to go. Samantha's crying.Joe-Joe-`84. Straight out of college.I had no plan for this day. Right now it feels like I'm.. Everything is smashed into a million pieces. It's like I'm suddenly in this-What?Diana. I know it's hard to understand, but it..It becomes normal.I know this is strange for you. And you may not feel like it's, but I need you right now. Because I'm-Hey guys. How was your day?Hello. Hello.It's OK honey. Mommy's just tired.So the caterpillar built a cocoon and it stayed safe inside for weeks. And when it emerged it was a beautiful butterfly..Sawsan. What are you doing here?Who?Sawsan, listen to me-We don't have him.Falli. Habbuck. Who else?Who else Mike?A call?You've.. We're killing them. We're killing the scientists.You'll drive them underground. They'll run straight to Iran. Pakistan.It's not my problem. It's not my problem. How can you sleep when you know-It's called counter-proliferation, Mike.I get death threats every day. People threatening to kill my husband. Hurt my children. I went to the agency and I requested security to protect my family. It was declined. Because quote \"My circumstances fall outside budget protocols.\" If this is a knife fight, right now, Sir - we're fighting it alone.What do I think? Do I want my photograph in Vanity Fair? Is that the question?I'm going to bed.My name is everywhere, Joe. My real name. Everywhere. All this publicity and noise and fighting talk, where is it getting us?It's the White House Joe. You seriously think you can pick a fight with the White House and win. They'll bury us.By the time they're finished here you won't know what that is.Hey.What's that?Joe wait-Joe. I didn`t send you. I didn't have that power.I didn't make the decision. I was asked to write a recommendation. What am I supposed to do. Not say my husband knows about this.Joe-So what do you want me to do Joe? Go to the papers like you did? Write a piece in the New York Times? You know I'd have to submit it to the Agency, and they'll-It's to MY FAMILY. I put my family first. ALWAYS. Were you putting them first when you wrote that fucking article?I'm taking different routes to and from school. I'm looking in empty rooms..under the beds every time I come home. A home we're going to lose because your work has dried up and your clients are running for cover. What has all this achieved? What changed Joe? Who won?How dare you?You think I'm lying to you.You fucking bastard..When we were at the \"Farm\", training to be field officers, they picked four or five of us and told us we'd stood out.We were bound, hooded and thrown in separate cells. They beat us. Deprived us of sleep. All you had to do was give up the name of one of the others. Just one name. For a glass of water. A sandwich. To avoid another punch.Another hour in a stress position.They push you until they find it. Til they find the point at which you break. Because they have to know. You have to know. And one by one, everybody broke. Except me. I never broke. I've been in situations, places where I was afraid. Where if you made a mistake, one tiny mistake, at any moment.. But I never made a mistake. And that made me feel special. I thought: I'm Different. Bullet- proof. You can't break me. I don't have a breaking point. I was wrong.OK. Say goodbye to your father.OK guys. C'mon.It's beautiful.How's is he?Yeah I see `em.Dad, I think my marriage is over.He wants me to go on the record. Speak out. Like that would suddenly make this all go away. We can't even speak to each other. I can't see how this comes round. I just can't see it, pop. Not anymore.Thank you.I don't care how angry you get. I don't care what they say about us. I don't care if you hate me. If they take everything away from us, but they are not going to take this. They do not get to take my marriage.You did good.I know why you did it. Thank you.This is who I am. Right here.So are you ready to fight?Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Valerie Plame Wilson, and I am honored to have been invited to testify under oath before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on the critical issue...", "clean_line": "jessica

Cosy.You work in the basement?That must be interesting work.I believe it's a concentrate obtained from uranium ore used to create fissile material for weapons programs. But I'm not a scientist.The UN Human Development Index ranks Niger the number one Least Liveable country in the world. I started my Foreign Service there. As Ambassador to Gabon, I travelled back many times. Then as director of Africa policy for the NSC under President Clinton, I frequently visited, often met with Prime Minister Mayaki. I know the former foreign minister. I know the Minister of Mines.Par la grace D'Allah. Comment allez vous, M. Bonzala ?So it would seem.500 tons of Yellowcake is not an off the books size transaction, it represents a 40% production increase in the nation's annual output of uranium. A sale that size would leave a huge paper trail.Any documentation would by law have to be signed by the Prime Minister, Foreign minister, and the Minister of the mines... But say it was an off the books deal..How do you hide the transportation of 500 tons of anything, let alone lightly refined uranium?The droughts of the 80s and 90s were met by millions of dollars of U.S Aid, which continues to this day. It just doesn't make sense Niger would compromise this lifeline. For that reason, and the others I've given, it's my opinion that the sale couldn't happen.What happens next?You guys are hysterical. I can't believe you're actually gonna send someone else all the way out there to ask exactly the same questions.I can save the CIA some air fare here. There isn't a snowflakes chance in hell this thing happened.Says me.What am I, a check or a balance?I'm not feeling that 007 right now.Us double oh's are more about the gratuitous sex.It's three forty five..Well...how long this time? I mean... Do we need childcare for tomorrow-Right. Its on the post-it.We've been leaving post-its for each other for months now.. we talk via Post-It. That fridge is like a dead letter drop. Jesus. Listen to me!. I sound like an old... Some- I don't know where you go. Who you meet. If you're in some jail, or lying in some ditch in Jordan, Beirut. And if you go missing, I can't tell anyone because you were never there. I'd never know what happened. I don't know where you go.Have a nice day.You want me to roll up a wet towel? Like a teenager smoking in his bedroom. Maybe sandbag my study?Oh right. Middle of winter. It's minus ten degrees. The whole point-Valerie. Steve. Help me out. Val. The whole point of a cigar you gotta get a little Winston Churchill vibe goin'. Slippers. A crackling fire.That's it. I quit.That's not quite true. It wasn't the Oval Office it was the Roosevelt Room.I haven't seen the intelligence. I'm not qualified to comment. We have intelligence services working hard to assess just this. But I have met Saddam. I've looked him in the eye, so I can tell you what I saw. During a particularly vicious period of bloodletting in the late eighties, Saddam was asked by his foreign minister why he had executed a certain official who had been a loyal supporter. He said he would rather kill a friend in error than allow an enemy to live. For me, that is the mark of a monster.She's fine. She's working late.Yeah. Well if you see her say hi. Listen Pete. I have a question. And it's real important.Hey. Are you OK?What's wrong Val?Whats the matter..what happened?Yeah. They're asleep.\"is an agency operative on weapons of mass destruction.\"They just went ahead and did it.Valerie. Where are you going?\"Two senior administration officials told me that Wilson's wife suggested sending him to Niger\" That means a Vice President, a chief of staff or top advisor.. I gotta go.It's been ringing all day.OK who wants to watch TV?Your mom called. And your Uncle. And Janey called from Chicago. I wrote them down. And Andrea Mitchell called. She says White House sources say that quote \"the real story here is not the sixteen words but Wilson and his wife\". Would I care to comment? Yeah I fuckin' would care to comment. She wants me on the show day after tomorrow.This is clearly designed as a shot across the bow to those who might step forward, those unnamed analysts who said they were pressured by the White House would think twice about having their own families names being dragged through this particular mud.I was sent to Niger at the request of the Vice President. I was not sent by my wife. The issue here is not who sent me here is whether a crime has been committed.It is a crime to reveal the identity of a covert agent working in the employ of this nations intelligence agencies. This is now a matter for the justice department Pete.The justice department need to establish whether those in the Highest Office sought to destroy the career of a public servant to punish me for speaking the truth.Valerie. Turn on MSNBC.I have another call. I have to go.Joe Wilson.Your support means everything to us. Really.The real heroes are in Iraq right now fighting a war which was prosecuted on lies and falsehoods.My wife and I have never sought publicity. But I know when I tell her about how much support there was here today, I know how thrilled and humbled she'll be.Karl Rove told the Financial Times they're rolling the earth movers over Joe Wilson. Quote.Go and play now.Did you send me to Niger? \"His business is struggling. He's on the slide. I'll throw him a bone.\" Was that it Val? You pull some strings for me? You help your old man out?Could I tell if you were?Can I help you? Excuse me. Can I help you?OK. This is a private lunch. Please leave us alone.OK. Leave now.OK. Leave my fucking table. Now.

You know that better than anyone. He's helped us before. Could you ask him to come in?Mr Wilson, what can you tell us about Yellowcake?What about Niger?The Office of the Vice President has received a report concerning a memorandum of sale between the governments of Niger and Iraq for the purchase of five hundred tons of Yellowcake Uranium ore..This is a request from the Vice President. Can you help us?What the fuck?Bullshit Jim. The only time a Vice President comes to Langley is to cut a fucking ribbon.It's a coordinated leak..Someone in the OVP leaked to the New York Times and now they're across the networks quoting the leak. \"Smoking gun\". \"Mushroom cloud\". They're using the same words. It's co-ordinated.Bill's right. This is just one snafu in a thousand we got right now. The scientists are-I never said this. If anyone asks, I deny any knowledge. How quietly can you do this?I don't what you're talking about..Sorry. I have to go.Valerie. What are you doing here?Valerie-I don't know what you're talking about.You were right. It's all about the scientists. We made a call.We passed your case files to liason. You know yourself we're not great at this stuff. Val, Mossad were already on the same page.Valerie-Valerie.

Number one I always open the window and close the door..Exactly. You can't be freezing your balls off in a GOOSEDOWN alone in the dark.My father smoked cigars at the dinner table for forty years. And look at me.Well Jeff. I don't know anything about these tubes. I'm not qualified. But I suppose the real question here is-Have you met him? Fred. Have you met Saddam? Have you looked him in the eye? Did he threaten you? Did he threaten to kill you? You don't know Saddam. You don't know what you're talking about.Can I get an American please. Just a regular American?Thank you.Is the President be referring to another African country?I don't know. I don't know what to do.Niger Pete. Yellowcake from Niger.So why has no one's come forward?It's the White House Pete. It's the President of the United States.Further down.How did it go?Hello? It's Lisa.They've launched an investigation. Ashcroft just announced it. They're saying he's going to convene a grand jury.I'll be home later. I gotta go over to Fox. They want me to comment on the investigation.We have to fight this Val. If we don't push back.At the end of the day, it's of keen interest to me to see whether or not we can get Karl Rove frog- marched out of White House in handcuffs. And trust me when I use that name, I measure my words.Tucker Carlson said yesterday that Wilson's wife sent him on a boondoggle. Said I needed the work. Who needs to work for free? Niger does have restaurants. The Opera. Reminds me alot of Paris.Someone from Vanity Fair called. They want to do a piece on us. Cover-story. Five thousand words. In-depth interview. Photographs of the two of us. What do you think?Val...what's wrong? What did I say?They'll bury us if we don't. How loud can you shout Val? Say we get in an argument you think you're right, and I think your wrong. You start making your point with all your might, and I start shouting back, except I'm the White House, and I can a shout a million times louder. Does that make me right? They lied Val. That's the truth.That is the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. On page thirty six it says \"the former ambassador's wife offered up his name\" and includes a memorandum written by Valerie Plame which says quote \"my husband has good relations with both the prime minister and the former Minister of Mines, both of whom could possibly shed light on this sort of activity.\" I've spent a whole year denying just this.Telling everyone who'll listen, on TV. In the press. My wife did not send me on a junket.You sent an email. The SSCI found the email.They have this now. They will call me a liar. It will stick. They have all the power here, what do I have?You have to defend us. Now.The agency? The.. Wait.. Is this the same Agency which won't give you protection for your children? Is this the same CIA that's erased your pension? Where's your loyalty Val? To your husband or the CIA?Maybe you're right. Maybe I should have kept my mouth shut. Is that what your dad taught you Valerie? That what Colonel Sam Plame said?Did you send me?My wife did not send me. I didn't receive payment. It was not a holiday. It was a fact finding mission in the run up to a war. But the fact is no one wanted facts.No comment.Hey guys.Come here.I'll see you both real soon OK?Good morning.She's fine. She's well. She uh..Hi. I'll just have a strong coffee. I'm not very hungry.No. Please.Shame on you. You call yourself a reporter. Shame on you. You're a self publicising hack. Fuck you. Fuck you.Pallisades.I'm fine.That's somebody else.Joe, we both know Freetown's a shit- hole.I wouldn't be so sure of that.Can we pull over. I'm going to walk. Look keep the change.No.I'm so sorry.I did it for me.Arguably the most important speech the president makes all year. Never more important when the nation is on the brink of war.How many of you know who put it in? How many of you know my wife's name? How do you know one and not the other?It was committed against you. And if you ever feel angry. Misrepresented. Ashamed even.Do something about it. In 1787 as Benjamin Franklin left the Constitution Hall after the last drafting session, he was stopped by a woman on the street. She asked---what manner of government have you bequeathed us? Ben said 'A Republic madam. If you can keep it.'If you can keep it.We are strong and we are free from tyranny only for as long as each and every one of us remembers their duty as citizens.Whether its a pothole at the end of your street or a lie in the State of the Union Address..Speak up. Ask the question. Demand the truth.Democracy is not a free ride...Man I'm here to tell you that. But its where we live. And if we do our job its where our children will live.
