That I don't do anything special enough to get in.Don't lie because you love me. My free form sucks.I love the necklace but you're still the best luck I'll ever have.Oh. It's a good luck charm. Doesn't always work.Lindsay... no. Not here.Ellison -- Mr. Ellison. He actually told me to break a leg.Know what would be great? If you didn't drop me off at the bus station. If we just kept going until we get to Philly.Right. This is the hardest, most important day of my life and all you can do is get there as soon as you can. Thanks, Mom.So I guess I'll see you later.Swim? You can't swim, Mom.Well, it's um, pretty self- explanatory. The theme.Thank you.Hi.Slept through most of it.Two suitcases. One big one.I'm kinda tired.Uh-huh.Thought you were moving to Fells Point.You bought a bed?Do you have a phone?You didn't at the last place. The last place I saw anyway.Over the summer. You blew me off for some gig on the road, remember? Can I call Lindsay? Let her know I got here alright.I feel fine. I feel like calling Lindsay.I can take the school bus. Tomorrow.Well, I know how to do both.-- I don't think I'll have time. I have to study, I'll be busy.Like you stay on top of yours?I didn't mean it like that.You don't have to go in with me. Since I'm all set. I mean, I have done this before. Gone to school. I'll be fine. I am fine. Really.Yeah. Sure. Whatever.About school? No. Not really.I'm not gonna be here that long. Besides, it's just a city, right?Thanks.It's a non-fiction novel. The first of its kind. Capote mixed true events with things he couldn't know, so he made them up.Yeah. That is part of it.Lots of people read them.Sara. It's Sara.God! Thank you!What's it called? What she's doing?No, I mean... the step, the...Asshole.He's in one of my classes. Thinks he's so... smart. So cute.So you know him?He's embarrassing.Fine. Tomorrow I catch the bus.What?I had a big lunch.It's a school night, Roy.I know it's too big.Who died and made you teacher?Nothing's up with it. I used to kind of dance. Ballet. Mostly.I don't know...For what?Look closer. And if I still look green, I think maybe you should wipe the crust from your eyes.I don't even know where it is.That's okay. I dance in circles. Probably around you.Chemistry.Right now it's taking me.I'll be asleep.Cool outfit.... I look okay?Hi.Is that... is he... yours?Chenille. She's ugly. She's fat!Wait. I have to ask you something. Do I really look alright?It's from the GAP.I'm not walking in there in my bra.Can't get much more underground than this.What are you, some kind of V.I.P.?Sara. It's Sara. And I know you. We have a class together.Maybe you came to the wrong spot, Nikki. I'm pretty sure this one doesn't have any Negroes.Rum and Coke, straight up. And a beer. I don't care. Anything.It's just a beer.Whatever.Whatever you want it to mean. You're the whiz kid, right? You know everything.I don't feel like dancing.Would I be here if I didn't?It's just a few blocks. It's okay.What?I have to look somewhere. The streets are deserted. Might as well look at you.It's not a question. It's the way you were beating that kid up. You looked so mad.Not like that. You were really kicking his ass.Are you laughing at me?Maybe he's my question. Your friend. Chenille doesn't like him.It was great.It wasn't the music I wasn't used to. I mean, it's not the first time I heard hip-hop, Patrick.Not all the time. But a lot.We passed it.Thanks for walking me.So. I'll see ya.I haven't said gee-whiz since I was six. But I really had a great time... okay?Oh.You're right. I should've said something. I'm sorry.Nope. Nothing special.Just adding to my collection. I heard some stuff I didn't have last night.Not as fly as you.Not yet anyway.Okay. Sure.Not to me.It was so... slamming, Lindsay. The dancing! I'm going again. What? No, I haven't seen anybody get shot yet. God, I didn't move to Bosnia.What happened?How 'bout fuck it? Or should I say fuck her? It's a fuck-fest, Roy.Sorry you got caught.Really? How often do you have it?I don't think it's realistic, what you're asking. Things happen. Things change. And the changes change you. What's the point of plans?You can't direct destiny.That was a long time ago.I don't know. Take a year off. Work. Go to college later on.Did you always want to be a doctor?Chenille. Everybody.What kind of doctor do you want to be?Do you have any? Kids.I wasn't being smart, Patrick.Screw you. I'm brilliant.I didn't get it. That thing you just did. Show me again?A releve. Over ice. With a twist.Ballet. I used to dance, Patrick.Uh-huh. Used to as in don't any more. And don't ask me why.Because I don't want to talk about it.Because it's not a big deal. Can we just concentrate on this?I have met somebody. Sort of. I think. I mean, there's this guy...What are you doing?Yeah I liked it. I was gonna go to Juilliard. That school fucked up my entire life. It's a long story.Why'd you do that?That's a good reason.You and Malakai?I don't get you guys. You seem so... different.Maybe you weren't then but you are now. You said you changed.I think Malakai's scary. And I know you're not.Patrick.That means you owe him something?No matter how much he messes up?I stole a hat once. When I was twelve. My mom found it under my mattress, made me take it back.You gonna turn me in?Yeah...tight... got along and shitThere's nothing to say.I'm sorry she's dead. God! What do you want me to do? Run through the streets screaming?Well, it won't. So drop it.Are you gonna tell me where we're going? Why is the surprise for me? You're the one with something to celebrate.I wanted to get you something and I couldn't figure out what. It's not much but I hope you like it.Wait. There's more.We have an audience. Work with me.Grab something.I can't. I can't go in.I know, but --I did.I'm sorry.I don't want you to think I didn't have a good time tonight, Patrick. I did. But ballet isn't a part of my life anymore.How do you know I have talent? Because I did some stupid leg trick.Maybe I don't want it to be real.What I want is to wake up and see my mom. For things to go back to the way they were. When they made sense. When my life made sense. And it's all my fault. She got scraped off the highway for me, for my fucking audition. She was rushing. It was raining. It was raining... ... But she promised to be there. I made her promise. And then I didn't wait for her. I should have but they called my name and I didn't say anything. I just went out and danced. I was mad. I needed her and she wasn't there.She was dying while I was dancing and I was mad at her and I'm sorry. I'm sorry...That's what makes it so bad. She always did what was right for me. I wanted to be a prima ballerina -- had to be. Even if it took most of our money, all of her spare time. I didn't care. It was my stupid dream and it killed her. All she wanted was for it to come true.I know... but she... I just don't think I can do it without her.Yeah. I do.Yeah. For my mom.See you tomorrow?It hurts! I'm out of shape and it hurts. Okay? Satisfied?Practice.I don't get in shape like that. But it's still a good spot. I got my application for Juilliard. Just in time too. They're holding auditions in Baltimore next month.I'll never be ready in a month.Mojo?You don't understand. Ballet takes a lot of time, a lot of preparation. I used to practice two, three hours every day. I'm so far behind...It's not as easy as that. My free form still sucks. It's still the weakest part of my routine. That hasn't changed.You will?Let's skip. Later.What?He's in D.C. Blues Alley. He'll be gone all night.Roy's demo. The only one he ever cut. Kinda grows on you.Wanna see my room?Sorry...Excuse me?Whose motto?Don't forget, they all have big dicks and beat their wives. Everybody knows that too.I don't have a favorite.I dunno. Maybe cymbidiums -- orchids. They're sort of show- boaty but they're pretty.Agua.Mmm. Mauve.Nut. What are you talking about?Why does he have to leave? We're all adults. Right?I hate being your daughter. You ruin everything.You mean it because he's black.Why's it bullshit? Because you hang with black guys and play jazz and have the hots for Angela Bassett?Keep telling yourself that. Just don't expect me to believe it. I saw how you looked at him. But you didn't see him. Well, for your information, he's a straight- A student with more heart and guts than you'll ever have!Want me to say it? You were a piece of shit husband and you're a piece of shit father! You were never there for Mom or for me. You took off and never looked back. So don't talk to me about guts.I have you figured out. You think you can make up all the time you missed, all the things you didn't do? You can't! I'm here because I have to be and it's a goddamned nightmare.How the hell would you know? You've been asleep for the past thirty-seven years!Over? I don't even know why it started... bitch. And don't say it's about Patrick because it's not. It's not about him.I like him, he likes me. And if you don't like that, screw you.I got suspended. Two days.I'm not sure. I think it's some kind of black female thing.It's alright. I'm okay.Look. It's not a good time. I'll see you later... I'm okay.Want me to take him?I'll get 'em.No. I explained about Nikki.She started it, Chenille. She wanted to start it. I told you what she said.So you agree with her? You think I don't belong with Patrick.We like each other. What is the big fucking deal? It's him and me. Not us and other 'people.'There's only one world, Chenille. I thought we were friends. Guess I was wrong.I gotta get home. Ready?Fuck you.We should keep going.I know I messed up. I'll get it right the next time.I can't work like this. I can't dance like this.Like this. You dictating to me.Nothing's wrong. I can't figure things out.Things, Patrick. Things between us. Things between us and them.Well, open your pretty brown eyes, look the hell around.Everything's screwed up. Nobody wants to see us together, not even Chenille. I don't know why they feel that way. How can I know? Maybe they have a point, Patrick.I'm just saying that we should think about this, that's all.Why are you getting mad?You're never gonna run your own life as long as you keep running back to Malakai every time he fucks up or fucks you over.I know he's lost, Patrick! Everybody but you can see that. And if you keep reaching back for him, you're gonna wind up lost too.They weren't rednecks!The hell with you too!Hi.Toni, listen carefully. You're a simple bitch and you don't have any friends, black or white, because nobody likes a fucking asshole.I was gonna tell you about the audition, Roy. I meant to.Uh-huh. The big day.You're not so bad. I didn't give you much to work with. It's not like I've been the perfect daughter.I don't hate you. I miss her. I miss Mom... ... Patrick's pissed at me. I'm pissed at him. He's not coming tomorrow and I want him there and I don't know what to do.I wanted somebody there who loves me.Yes... sir... they have... my music.Yes. Emo... Emotion.I'm sorry.

'Cause you don't wanna talk about it?Yeah, we can concentrate. But I think it is a big deal. Whatever it is you don't wanna talk about.What y'all doin' to my nephew?Didn't you like it when you 'used' to dance?Let me guess. You don't wanna talk about it.I stole a bike here once.'Cause I didn't have one.I used to do wild shit like that.Yep. Most of the time.We're not.Doesn't make me different from him. Not the way you think it does.What you mean by scary? 'Kai's tough. He has to be. He still got a good heart. I know.Let me finish. Me and him got into some shit awhile back. Real bad shit. We held up a gas station off 95. I bailed the ride -- jumped out the car. 'Kai kept goin', got caught. I knew what he was gonna do that night. Knew the car was hot. I woulda been guilty as him if they had caught me, if Malakai had served my name up. But he didn't.He did his time plus most of mine. I owe him that.We all mess up. Maybe Malakai gave up. But he's still m'boy and he still got a chance. I ain't just gonna cross him completely off and be like everybody else.Gangsta' Sara. Stole a hat. Call the F.B.I.I think I'll wait for you to surrender. Were you tight with your mom, Sara? I mean, y'all get along and shit?So she meant something to you. How come you never talk about her?Know why there's nothing to say? Because you don't talk about her. You won't talk about her.Why not? If it helps.And you call Malakai scary.We can celebrate together.I like it. I love it. Thank you.Work with you?Surprise... Sara?You have to go in. This is where I'm bringing you. The ballet.But what?I thought you would like it.You ain't actin' like you did.Why not? What happened? You just woke up one day and decided to waste your talent.I saw the look on your face when you did it, Sara. The same look I saw tonight. Goofy happy. So if you're gonna tell me somethin' about not dancing, at least tell me somethin' real.It's not your fault it rained or she died. Or that you danced. That's what you were there for. Your mom would've expected you to do what you did.You still got whatever you had when your mom was alive, Sara. She wouldn't want you to give up.Do you want to do it, Sara? I mean you. Do you want Juilliard?Then it's on you to make the dream come true.For her. For you.Lemme see that move you did. That cute leg relieve thing. Come on, Sara.That's what you call outta shape, what's it take to get you in shape?This is the perfect spot for that. You can run around and I can sit under the trees and watch you.That's great!Sara, you puttin' the mojo on yourself.Negative shit. White folks call it karma. The bad kind.Quit whinin' and catch up then.So I'll help you with it.Yeah. I'll help you. Tell me what you need to do and let's get busy.Nobody's watchin' you but me.Sara...?I'm sorry.How can a piece of shit tell?Back out my business, boy.How am I frontin', 'Kai? I made time for this bullshit, didn't I?Y'all hangin' tonight or what?Eastside? That's the wrong side.I ain't messin' with those fools over there. You know how they are.That ain't protection. It's an excuse for some unnecessary mayhem.How you know? You ain't tried nothing else. Now you sittin' up here strapped for no good reason. You askin' for trouble, Malakai. You think this shit's funny?Fuck you, Lip. I know what's out there. I also know you can get past it. But that ain't gonna happen, 'Kai, long as you keep gettin' in your own way.What's your favorite flower?Yeah, but if you did...What's your favorite color?What's your second favorite color?You're makin' this real hard, Sara. Those ain't exactly tuxedo colors.I was tryin' to get around to askin' you somethin' but since I'm some sorta nut, you probably wouldn't wanna go to prom with me...Chill, man. I'm goin'. You don't have to come off with all 'at.Druid Hill? Hell yeah.I got study hall. Don't matter anyway. Not with those suckers. I'll be back before the bell rings.Pretty bad. Can't even play a got-damned game of ball no more.Shit!I thought you had somethin' to say to me.Somethin' must be on your mind for you to get up in Sara's face, start all this drama. What you tryin' to prove, Nikki?What if she is? What's it to you? You didn't see me trippin' off that Howard dude and I could have. I coulda tripped hard, Nikki.How you gonna call it different?You don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nikki.I thought I was goin' someplace good with you. You the one called me off. But you ain't tryin' to remember that. Now you mad. Why? Because she's white and I like her? I'm with her.It ain't got no business settin' you off! Me and her ain't got nothin' to do with you and what you think. So keep your hands off her and that shit to yourself.How many times you gonna ask me that?Even if I did ride, you ain't got nobody but Lip and Lip will get a nigger's ass killed. Quick.That shit ain't funny.Have you lost your motherfuckin' MIND, man? Huh? Have you!'Cause you wrong, Malakai!You messed up.No. You gonna get it right now so you can do it perfect next time.Like what?What's wrong, Sara?What things? The audition? You ain't got nothin' to worry about. I told you. I'll be there.I didn't know there was a 'them.'They only got a point if you believe they got a point, Sara.That's a fuckin' 'nough.Because I like to think for myself, run my own life, and I thought you did too.First of all, Malakai ain't never fucked me over. Second of all, you don't know him, Sara, what he been through. Matter of fact, you don't know shit about none of it. So don't come off to me like you do.Who the fuck are you to say he's lost? Malakai had my back when you were busy gee-whizzin' in the woods with your backward-ass, redneck friends.You know what? The hell with you.Thought you might need this on Saturday. I ain't gonna be able to make it.They just got bad news, man. They don't need to hear it again. Arvel's fightin'. He's gonna pull through. Thing is, when he does, they don't think... he ain't... shit. Arvel ain't gonna walk again.Malakai... ... When it's on, I'll be there.I don't care what you said, Chenille.It's besides the point. Whatever point it is you tryin' to make.I gotta go.He's not a fool, Chenille.I still gotta go. Check you later.Pull over. This ain't helpin' nobody, 'Kai. I'm out. I mean it. Stop the car.What you gonna do, 'Kai? You gonna shoot me? Go ahead! You'll have to!Yes, sir. She's ready.You can do it. Ain't nobody watchin' you but me.All due respect, if ya'll don't let this girl in, you're crazy!", "clean_line": "white folks felt safe capote scared em took hard core crime ghetto dropped america yard makes book special capote wasn richard wright james baldwin thing wasn tryin read lots people like hello think gotta work fired ass nikki bye hit shut hell sweatin snookie happened lunch man hangin man feelin strong gonna stay right hoops school break free throw chump chumps like got problems snook ain gonna doctor nothin til letter big wouldn know difference ethyl glycol methyl acetate got elements parts versus blow vial right person hand misread component feetz ain square dance let think gonna gonna drop pick felt like ain anymore nikki bad choice best beer know drank mean like know standin supposed dizzy remember circles danced know let mon hips fast sara like hands flashlight neon light stop light everybody got little light sun man hell doin tryin sent couldn let slide malakai fuck parole ain gonna juvee eighteen jessup hardcore lockdown want definitely got stompin damn sure man chenille heard times okay okay come braveheart lookin wanna know somethin ask somethin mad wasn kid suburb mars right folks fight friend trouble likes stop trippin malakai good people way know like like feetz got music uh huh bet listen time gettin closer crib stop food water passed problem ya like gee whiz great time wait like ya ll bust cap ass darken doorstep okay shit man bomb shell thank snookie way soon outta throwin party fly night dancin mean fly maybe hook later school somethin work moves want way hammer pretty played got actually car wash work yeah job hangin think good idea kai try layin shit awhile chance know mean ain like good sense know mrs gwynn feel groove let music mess said wanna doctor tight watch butt pediatrics like kids come stay slackin wouldn time shit dance brought relieve thing cause wanna talk yeah concentrate think big deal wanna talk doin nephew like dance let guess wanna talk stole bike cause wild shit like yep time different way think mean scary kai tough got good heart know let finish got shit awhile real bad shit held gas station bailed ride jumped car kai kept goin got caught knew gonna night knew car hot woulda guilty caught malakai served time plus owe mess maybe malakai gave boy got chance ain gonna cross completely like everybody gangsta sara stole hat think ll wait surrender tight mom sara mean shit meant come talk know talk won talk helps malakai scary celebrate like love thank work surprise sara bringing ballet thought like ain actin like happened woke day decided waste talent saw look face sara look saw tonight goofy happy gonna tell somethin dancing tell somethin real fault rained died danced mom ve expected got mom alive sara wouldn want want sara mean want juilliard dream come true lemme cute leg relieve thing come sara outta shape shape perfect spot run sit trees watch great sara puttin mojo negative shit white folks karma bad kind quit whinin catch ll help yeah ll help tell need let busy watchin sara sorry piece shit tell business boy frontin kai time bullshit hangin tonight eastside wrong ain messin fools know ain protection excuse unnecessary mayhem know ain tried sittin strapped good reason askin trouble malakai think shit funny fuck lip know know past ain gonna happen kai long gettin way favorite flower yeah favorite color second favorite color makin real hard sara ain exactly tuxedo colors tryin askin somethin sorta nut probably wouldn wanna prom chill man goin come druid hill hell yeah got study hall matter suckers ll bell rings pretty bad play got damned game ball shit thought somethin somethin mind sara face start drama tryin prove nikki trippin howard dude coulda tripped hard nikki gonna different know talkin nikki thought goin someplace good called ain tryin remember mad white like ain got business settin ain got nothin think hands shit times gonna ask ride ain got lip lip nigger ass killed quick shit ain funny lost motherfuckin mind man huh cause wrong malakai messed gonna right perfect time like wrong sara things audition ain got nothin worry told ll know got point believe got point sara fuckin nough like think run life thought malakai ain fucked second know sara matter fact know shit come like fuck lost malakai busy gee whizzin woods backward ass redneck friends know hell thought need saturday ain gonna able got bad news man need hear arvel fightin gonna pull thing think ain shit arvel ain gonna walk malakai ll care said chenille point point tryin gotta fool chenille gotta check later pull ain helpin kai mean stop car gonna kai gonna shoot ahead ll yes sir ready ain watchin respect ya ll let girl crazy"}}}
