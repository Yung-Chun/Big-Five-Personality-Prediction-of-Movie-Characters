Strack laughs good-naturedly.Like anyone else.No, I understand.....Were you ever married, Louis?I'm sorry. Strack strains to conceal the bitterness of his grief.It must have been a terrible time. I wondered how you understood. About me. You've been very patient. And very kind. Strack smiles warmly. He takes her hand.Staring. She takes a step towards him. She stops, immobilized. Her jaw drops.

I'm sure my father never intended for you to know about it. I'm sorry if He's compromised you in any way. But I am asking you to understand. I'm not going to bore you with that old speech about how we all have to swim in the same pond.

Ordinarily you don't have to face it. Well, I face it, and a lot worse, into acynic--that's the easy way out, and I'm tougher than that. Strack gestures towards a table-top architectural model of the Riverfront Development.Take a look at that model, Julie. That was my father's dream. Now it's my dream. Acres of riverfront reclaimed from decay, thousands of jobs created, a building block--a very large building block--laid for the future. Not such a bad dream, as dreams go. And if the price of realizing that dream is the occasional distasteful chore, well...Let me suggest this. You excuse yourself for a few minutes, go to the ladies' room, leaving your briefcase here.

He takes her by the arm and starts to lead her across the crowded floor.I haven't wanted to bother you during your period of grief, but I have to know whether you've come to a decision regarding the Belasarius Memorandum.Do you remember when I mentioned a certain competitor of mine, Robert G. Durant?Believe me, I am no stranger to the frustration and anguish that comes from the loss of a loved one. He forces himself to rally his spirits.My dear, there's no cure for grief...But there is something that eases the symptoms. It's called... He sweeps her out onto the dance floor..Dancing!I've already spoken to Ed Pappas.Don't be childish, I had every right.

Didn't Ruth inform you that we have tickets to Der Fliedermause tonight?Excellent! I love to talk. Brandy?I'll have one;_ As he walks to a bar and pours himself a drink....Fair warning--it's Napoleon, and it's quite good--Darling, settle down. Don't be rash. As you say, let's talk..Your news has a bittersweet flavor... Of course I'm very happy for you. If there's anything I can do-- the finest medical care can be at your disposal--burn therapy, recon- structive surgery. How badly was he... mutilated? Julie has broken down. She sits down on Strack's sofa, her body wracked with sobs.... Where is he, Julie?Not now!... Who?... All right, I'll take it in the other room. He looks up at Julie.I won't be a moment. He walks into an adjoining room. He picks up the phone.Yes, Franz... And the closing price?...I feel sufficiently diversified... Franz, it is immaterial to me what the market is doing. I want you to buy...Yes, you did hear me correctly. I want you to buy. Ten thousand Krugerands. Fresh ones!.I'm sorry you had to find that, dear. Our relationship didn't need this further strain.Not me personally. I have an employee who does certain things for me, unofficially, off the books. Robert doesn't like to pay taxes.Hardly. You have nothing on me, my dear, and you'd find the extremely expensive police department quite unsympathetic. . Julie. Consider the big picture.I suppose this is goodbye then. Julie stares hatefully at him for a beat, then hurries out the door.Send Robert in. Strack strolls over to the window and stares out at his rising city. OS the door clicks open.You recall the little difficulty with my father and how you resolved it. We have a similar situation with Miss Hastings. It seems Miss Hastings has uncovered some unflattering information about us.Your wife died. I'm joking, of course. No, the good news is that I know who's behind our little troubles of late. When you retrieved my memorandum, you failed to excise the good doctor.He's alive. I don't like loose ends, Robert. Finish it.I believe we have a guide.We've consolidated the waterfront, Governor ...Yes, I'm aware there's been some unpleasantness but that's over now. Yes, I'm sure. You sound a little nervous, Bryant. Have a brandy, watch a cop show. The door opens. A security officer appears.You look like hell, Robert.And Westlake?g expect he'll pop up here soon.I'm glad you survived, Robert. I'd hate to see your kids deprived of a role-model.Kids need an example, Robert. When I was a young man my father made me work high steel. That's how he started out, and in his view what was good enough for him was good enough for me......It was just me and the Indians, no one else crazy enough to run around up here, against the wind, four-fifty an hour. Sure I resented it, but now-- call me crazy--sometimes I miss it, it sharpens your wits. Life on the edge. Five inches wide. Two hundred fifty feet down. High steel... He turns to face Durant. There's a gun in his hand.You don't have any kids, Robert.Or should I say, Doctor Westlake?Then I'm going to make a mistake. There's a long beat. The vein begins to pulse on Durant's temple. His eyes grow predatory, evil.You want to see the girl? Follow me, I'll take you to her... Durant/Darkman follows, taking the first few tentative steps....I must say, Dr. Westlake, you've certainly worked some mischief. Pretty much wiped out the security arm of Strack Industries. That's okay. I'm a good sport... He leaps from beam to beam, Durant/Darkman following cautiously behind....And I can handle my own problems. I do whatever I have to do. In fact, that's how I got my first properties. My wife--late wife--held certain deeds... I sent her on a plane trip over the Smokies and well, let's just say ;landed on My feet...Then share my dream. After all, you and I are pretty much the same. We should be working together. Both smart fellows. Similar styles. Same taste in women. I could use a man like you.Eventually, eventually... He proceeds nimbly along the beam.I guess you just don't have what it takes. I gather you run around wearing other people's faces now, since yours is so... loathsome. He shrugs..See I could never do that. The world has to take me as I am. And all this tit-for- tat stuff you've been up to. Silly.

Separated by ruthless forces, larger than they!--What a banal tale. In it, I suppose I play the villain. But wait, Julie--which of us is the monster here?!

With a sharp practiced motion, he plucks out the pin.Of course, there are serious emotional side effects to this operation. When the body ceases to feel, when so much sensory input is lost, the patient becomes alienated. The mind, cut off from its regular diet of input, has a never-satisfied thirst; alienation gives rise to loneliness, anger; uncontrolled rage is not uncommon.
