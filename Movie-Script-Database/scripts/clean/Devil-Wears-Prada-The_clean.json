{"Devil-Wears-Prada-The": {"ANDY": {"raw_line": "What floor is Elias-Clarke? Human Resources.This article was about the Take Back the Night march. This was a four-part series on the impact of busing on the public schools...And the other one--?Hi, I have an appointment with Emily Charlton--And you're replacing yourself.Yes. Of course. Who's Miranda?Sounds great. I'd love to be considered.What makes you think I'm not interested in fashion?What's wrong?Wow, this is like self-esteem camp.My name is Andy Sachs. I recently graduated from--I think I could do a good job as your assistant and--I came to New York to be a journalist and I sent letters to everyone and I finally got a call from Elias-Clarke and met with Sherry in Human Resources and basically it's this or Auto Universe.No.No.That depends on--I was Editor in Chief of the Daily Northwestern. I won a national competition for college journalists with a series on the janitor's union ----that uncovered the exploitation of--Okay, you're right. I don't fit in here. I'm not glamorous or skinny and I don't know much about fashion. But I'm smart, I learn fast and I will work very hard.Thank you for your time.Don't be a jerk.Okay, how is it that you know who she is and I didn't?Yeah, it's just that I'm not one of them.You should see the way the girls dress at Runway. I'm not sure I have anything to wear to work.I think I might.You are so full of it.Hello? Now?I'm almost there.Yes. She gave me the job.Actually, I'm from Cincinnati.What if the building's on fire or my appendix explodes or something?Man the desk at all times. Got it.How do I prove I'm not a psycho?Wait. What do I do if--Oh no. Mrs. Priestly's office. That's what I meant. Miranda Priestly's office.She's in a meeting. Can I take message? I'm sorry. Can you spell Gabbana-- Guess not.Hi, I'm Andy, I'm the new--That's very nice of you, but I don't need those. Miranda hired me. She knows what I look like.Actually, it's Andy.My name is Andy. Andrea, but people call me Andy.What kind of--Demar--Yes?Demarchelier... Demarchelier...She called me in and asked me about Pier 59. She said something about Simone and Frankie and someone else. And she needs skirts from Calvin Klein. I think that's the most important thing, but I couldn't tell. Oh, and there was something about a pony.I tried to ask her, but--Me?So I just, what, go down to the Calvin Klein store and ask them--Of course not. I'm going... to his house.Sorry. Got it. What's the nearest subway stop?Thanks.You're going to say a million girls would kill for my job.I'm about to walk in. I'll call you as soon as--There's a um, variety of skirts. Let's see...I'm sorry. What's your name?It's Liz.Is Ivan in by any chance?You haven't peed since I left?The run-through. Right.Is it always like this?You eat lunch?None of the girls here eat anything?I'm a 6.Okay. You think my clothes are hideous. I get it, okay? The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05But I'm not going to be working in fashion forever. I don't see any reason to change everything about myself because I have this job.No, no, no. It's just...It's just that both of those belts look the same to me. I'm still learning about this stuff, so--You should have seen the look she gave me. I thought the flesh was going to melt off her face.It's not funny. She could be the most horrendous person I've ever met. She's not happy unless everyone around her is panicked, nauseous or suicidal. And all the Clackers just WORSHIP her... They call them Clackers. Their stilettos in the marble lobby... clack, clack, clack...And they all act like they're curing cancer or something. The amount of time and energy they spend on things that DON'T MATTER!!! Poring over these minute details. And for what?So tomorrow they can spend an extra 300,000 dollars reshooting something that was probably fine to begin with? To sell people things they don't need?God, I'm not even hungry anymore. Maybe that's why everyone there is so skinny.I just have to stick it out for one year. Then I can do what I came to New York to do. I can't let Miranda get to me. I won't.And give me that sandwich.Good morning, Miranda!I have Isaac.Wow. Thank God it's Friday, huh?My Dad's coming in from Ohio this weekend. We're having dinner tonight. Then we're seeing \"Chicago\"...You doing anything fun this weekend?Dad! I'll be right down!How did you-- I'm gonna kill Mom. Thank you.It's so good to see you. You want to start grilling me now or should we wait until after dinner?Oh, just go ahead.Hey. Not fair. I wrote those e- mails.Oh please. Not this again.Because it's what you wanted. This is what I want.I'm an executive assistant.You have to trust me. Being Miranda's assistant opens a lot of doors. Emily is going to Paris with Miranda in a few months, she'll meet editors and writers from every important magazine.Dad, I swear. This is my break. This is my chance. This is my---boss.I have to get it.Absolutely, Miranda. Let me see what I can do.I'm so sorry, Dad. I have to deal with this.I need a jet from Miami to New York... A jet, any kind of jet... Yes, tonight, right now. From Miami to New York. As soon as possible. Please call me back as soon as the situation changes. I'm trying, Miranda. No one is flying out because of the weather.But--I've done everything I could think of. I don't know what else to do.I'm sorry, Dad. Miranda, you don't understand. Even if I get you a plane, they won't let you take off tonight and--Oh my God. She is going to murder me.I'm so sorry, Miranda.I did everything I could think of--She hates me, Nigel.I need your help. I don't know what to do. It's like I'm completely beneath her contempt.That's not fair. I'm lucky to be working for Miranda -- I didn't get that at first, but I do now. I want to be here. But it just seems like no matter how hard I try, I don't do anything right.Okay, fine!You're right. I'm screwing this up. And I know this could be a big break for me. I'm going to try harder, I promise. But there's one thing I can't do by myself.You do it with the other girls.Please, Nigel. Don't make me beg...A... poncho?Miranda Priestly's office. She's not in. I'll leave word.Can I help you, luv?What do you think?Wanna lift, stranger?Bang & Olufsen. Charlie Rose sent it to Miranda for her birthday.I looked it up online. It's 750 dollars. She doesn't want it, so Emily told me to keep it. Oprah sent a present. So did Jessica Simpson. And Nelson Mandela.Here... A bunch of Kiehl's, some Mason Pearson hair brushes...It's called \"Pink\". For women.Sure you can.Thing is, it turns out there's a lot more to Runway than fancy purses... you know who's coming into the office Friday? John Updike.Look, there's a piece by Jay McInerney, an essay by Joan Didion, an interview with Christiane Amanpour oh...Give me the phone.Give me the phone.Come on, guys. Give me the phone!Hello, Miranda. Fine. No problem. I'm leaving right now. You guys didn't need to be such assholes.I'm looking for James Holt...Hi, I'm Andy. I'm picking up for Miranda Priestly.You.I'll guard it with my life.Hi. I, um... I have to go.God, I love it when total strangers tell me how I feel.Christian Thompson? You're kidding. You write for every magazine I love. I actually reviewed your collection of essays for my college paper.No, but I did point out some factual errors and a penchant for confessional semi-fiction that borders on self-indulgent.Well, I want to work somewhere like the New Yorker or Vanity Fair. I'm also a writer, but--Thank you. That would be great. Anyway, for now I'm Miranda Priestly's assistant.Excuse me?I have to go.You. Are not a nice person.For your information, he's really handsome. And we already live together!Where are you going?But I came back so we could hang out.Okay, look, I'm sorry about that--Yes, she explained every detail of her decision-making, then we brushed each other's hair and gabbed about American Idol.What's a preview, anyway?And she tells them what she thinks?What does that mean?Last time I was here, James was having this cool party and-- --and this is why you don't like people riding up in the elevator with you.She pursed her lips and because of that he's going to change his entire collection?--Galliano at Pastis. Done.It's in the car.Of course. If I can deliver the Book, that means I must have done something right, that she doesn't think I'm psycho. Oh, and she actually called me Andrea instead of Emily. Isn't that great?Shit.But I can't... Shh...Okay, before you start freaking out, it wasn't such a big deal. The twins said hello, I said hello back, then I went upstairs and gave the book to Miranda--You're right. I made a mistake.Wait a second. She's going to fire me?Miranda, about last night, I--Of course. I'll run down to Barnes & Noble right now.Not that I can recall.So you want the... unpublished manuscript.She doesn't get it. There's no way I can get that book. I don't care who I call.Of course.No problem.Great. I have to get the impossible manuscript in four hours. And Smith and Wollensky's doesn't open until 11:30. How am I supposed to get the steak? She's going to fire me, isn't she? She's just prolonging the kill. Like an evil cat with a tiny unfashionable mouse.Or--It's for Miranda Priestly... it's very important. Yes, I know, it's impossible to get...Anything? Can you try again? I would really appreciate any leads at all... thanks. No pressure. If I don't have it by 3, I'm fired.Yeah. It's a real party.You probably don't remember me. We met at James Holt's party and I work for Miranda Priestly and--Listen. I desperately need a favor. And I don't know many people in the book world...I'm sorry to ask you. I'm desperate.We're talking about Miranda Priestly. There is no plan B, only plan A. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05Is she back? Am I fired?Harry Potter. The manuscript. It's for Miranda Priestly. I need it today. Can you make it extra hot? Like, center of the sun hot?Sorry, my boss is particular. Are you sure? You're my last shot. All right, well, thanks for trying.Actually, it is. A million girls would kill for it.Want a mocha?I failed. She's going to fire me anyway. Might as well beat her to the punch.Call you later.Hello?You didn't.No. That would mean I actually... did something right. But see... thing is... See, I was about to...Yes, I'm meeting someone...I'm begging you. You have to stall her. Just ten minutes.Actually I made two copies. And had them color-copied, re-set and bound so they wouldn't look like manuscripts.Anything else I can do for you?Listen, Nate--After I called you, I realized... It doesn't make sense to throw away all these months of hard work. I just had a moment of weakness. That's all.That's all it is, Nate. Just a job.I get the point, Nate.Gstaad. It's a ski resort. In Switzerland.Nate, it's not like I run the magazine. I just work there, remember?I'm the same person I was. I still want the same things.I promise. Same Andy, better clothes.What about these? These are pretty nice.And this skirt? Okay. What about this?Are you okay?Great. Thanks. That's perfect, because I need to get to Magnolia Bakery before they close......it's Nate's birthday and we're having a little party for him--Anyway, have fun tonight.Um... I thought only the first assistant went to the benefit.Don't look at me. This is the last thing I want to do.I need to learn all these people by tonight?Lily, just start without me. I'll be there as soon as I can.I will. I promise. Believe me, this is the last thing I want to--Oh, I love that. I'll call you the second I'm leaving.Will that fit me?Let's see. My feet are killing me, everything pinches......my breasts are squeezed into a ball and this hairpiece is like having a boulder pinned to my head...Never felt better.And you look... so thin.It's definitely working.That's... great.I was wondering how long you think we'll have to stay because I was hoping to--That's Massimo Cortileono, chairman of-Ambassador Franklin. And that's the woman he left his wife for, Rebecca. The woman he's leaving HER for is the man walking down the stairs in Valentino.That's... Jacqueline Follet, right? From French Runway.Alors, Jacqueline, ditez-moi, avez- vous rencontr\u00e9 Brad Pitt?Are you sure?Thank you. Thank you so much.I'm sorry to bother you, but I've been dying to ask you... Is it true that John Cheever used to ghostwrite the editor's page of Manhattan Magazine in the 50's?...Hey, I figured out a few things on my own, too. Turns out I'm not as nice as you thought.Do you really say things like that to people?I have to go...Well, maybe I could-- No no no. I can't. I just can't.Can you go any faster?Happy Birthday.Nate, I'm so sorry. I was trying to leave, but there was a lot going on and I didn't have a choice and--Can we at least talk about it this--I don't understand what's so difficult about scheduling a preview. If you want Miranda to give you any editorial, we'll need to see the clothing at least three weeks before the show. Yes, please. See what you can do.Yeah. I'm... fine.Miranda Priestly's office. Thanks. I gotta go pick up the Polaroids from the shoot.Great. No problem.Sorry. Busy day. And my personal life is going down the drain. That's all.Wait. You want ME to -- oh, no. No, no. Emily would die. Her whole life is about Paris.She hasn't eaten in weeks. I can't do that, Miranda. I can't.But--Emily--Emily, I have to talk to you.Okay. Emily. When you get in, I want to talk to you about something--Not exactly.I didn't have a choice. You know how she is.Look, I know you're mad. And I don't blame you.Emily--Okay, now you're scaring me.Lily, this show is amazing. I am so proud of you.What are you talking about? I wouldn't miss this.Come on.Actually...Sorry. I'll be too busy working. You'll have to find someone else's life to change.He's just a guy I know from work.You're making a big a deal out of--It just happened--Great. Now you're going to give me a hard time, too?Miranda asked me and I couldn't say no, okay? I didn't have a choice.Okay. I get it, you're mad because I work late all the time, because I missed your birthday party--You hate Runway. And Miranda. You think fashion is stupid. You've made that clear.So now I have no integrity. Great.That's absurd.You don't mean that.Then maybe this trip is coming at a good time. Maybe we should take a break.Nate!Hello, Miranda...Wait. This is not right. Miranda is staying in the suite.This is my room?Oh, do I?Actually, Miranda has a dinner.Oh, you're so full of it. You are not desol\u00e9 at all.Sure. No problem. I have it right here, um...But your table is full.So Stephen is not... so you don't need me to fetch Stephen from the airport tomorrow?Of course.Miranda, I'm so sorry. If you want me to cancel your evening, I can.Miranda, is there... is there anything else I can do?What do you mean?Oh, I just threw it on.What are we toasting?Nigel. I got my job months ago.You're leaving? Nigel, I can't imagine Runway without you.God. I'm so happy for you, Nigel. You deserve it....I've never seen anyone as dedicated as Miranda.I'm just saying, yes, there are things she does I don't agree with, but...Okay, so she's tough, but if Miranda were a man, no one would notice anything but how great she is at her job.I resent that.Sexy? Really?I have no idea where we're going. You could be leading me anywhere...You are unbelievable. Do you write that stuff down and file it away to use on girls?Well, I never understood why everyone was so crazy about Paris, but now...It's. So. Beautiful.I can't do this.Nate and I only split up a few days ago. I've had too much wine and my judgement is impaired. I barely know you and I'm in a strange city. I'm out of excuses.What the hell is this?Of?They're replacing Miranda?Miranda will be devastated. Runway is her whole life. He can't do that to her.And she has no idea...?I have to go.Oh, thank God. Where are you?I need to talk to you. Right away. It's about Jacqueline Follet, she--Shit!I have to talk to you.Miranda, wait. I have to talk to you. You can fire me if you want to after that, but... Irv is going to make Jacqueline Follet editor-in-chief of Runway. Christian Thompson told me, he's going to work for her. Irv's going to tell you today. I thought if I told you now, you could fix it.What? No. I specifically told them--You said it was your dream job.But you don't need her. You could just leave anyway and-You sure about that?But I don't think I am like that.I couldn't do what you did to Nigel, Miranda. There's no way I could do something like that.That's not what I -- that was different. I didn't have a choice.But what if it's not what I want? I mean, what if I don't want to live the way you do?You're such a pain.True.I just wanted to say...Nate, you were right. About everything. I turned my back on my friends, my family, on everything I believed in. And for what?Nate, I'm just... I'm so sorry.And?That's great, I... congratulations.Don't know what I'm going to do without those late night grilled cheeses.You think?Not sure.You think so?Thanks. I actually have a job interview today.That's fine.Learned a lot. In the end, though, I kind of screwed it up.Emily, it's Andy. Don't hang up. I have a favor to ask you.Thing is, I have all these clothes from Paris and I don't have anyplace to wear them, so I was wondering... is there any way you could take them off my hands?Thanks, Emily.

certainly has a bizarre sense of humor. Follow me.Okay, so... I was Miranda's second assistant, but her first assistant recently got promoted so now I'm the first...I'm trying. Miranda sacked the last two girls after only a few weeks. We need to find someone who can survive here. Do you understand?You didn't just ask me that. She's the editor in chief of Runway. Not to mention a legend. Work a year for her and you can get a job at any magazine you want. A million girls would kill for this job.Andrea, Runway is a fashion magazine. An interest in fashion is crucial.Oh my God. No. No, no, no.She's on her way -- tell everyone!Her driver text-messaged. Her facialist ruptured a disk. God, these people!I can't even talk about it.Oh no. You're still here. Go.No, stay. I don't want you walking past her. Just sit there and I'll pray she doesn't notice you marring the area.I'm so sorry, Miranda. I did confirm last night, but--Right.Nobody. Human resources sent her up about the assistant job and I was pre- interviewing her for you, but--She wants to see you.. Go go go....Andrea!Miranda decided to kill the Autumn Jacket story for September -- she's pulling up the Sedona shoot from October. You need to go into the office right this second. Pick up her coffee order on the way. Write this down.Where are you?I hope you know this is a very difficult job for which you are totally wrong and if you mess up MY head is on the chopping block.Okay, first of all, you and I answer the phones. The phone MUST be answered every single time it rings.Phones roll to voicemail, she gets very upset. If I'm not here, you are chained to this desk.One time an assistant left the desk because she sliced her hand open with a letter opener. Miranda missed Lagerfeld right before he boarded a 17 hour flight to Australia. She now works at TV Guide.Miranda Priestly's office. She's not available. I'll tell her you called. Yet again. Remember, you and I have totally different jobs. You run errands, you get coffee, etcetera. I am in charge of her schedule, her expenses, her appointments. And, most importantly... I get to go with her to Paris for Fashion Week in the fall.I get to wear couture, go to all the shows, all the parties, meet all the designers. It's divine.Okay, stay here. I'm going to the art department to give them the Book.The Book is a mock-up of everything in the current issue. We deliver it to Miranda's apartment every night and she returns it in the morning with her notes. The second assistant is supposed to do it, but Miranda is very private and doesn't like strangers going to her house. So until she decides you're not a psycho, I get the lovely task of waiting around for the Book.I have no idea.I have Miranda Priestly calling. I have Patrick.Did she say which skirts? Did she say what kind? Color? Shape? Fabric?You never ask Miranda. Anything. All right, I'll take care of the other stuff. You go to Calvin Klein.I'm sorry. Do you have a prior commitment? Is there some hideous pants convention?You're not going to the store.You are catching on quickly. We always send assistants to a designer's home on their very first day. You're going to his showroom. I'll give you the address.Good God. You do not. Under any circumstances. Take public transportation.While you're out... Miranda needs you to go to Hermes and pick up twenty five scarves we ordered for her. Cassidy forgot her homework at Dalton, pick that up. And Miranda went out to meet with Meisel, she'll want more Starbucks when she gets back.Oh my God. What took you so long? I have to pee.You do the coat.Now, be prepared. The run-through is at 12:30 and people are panicking, so the phone is going to be ringing off the hook.The editors bring in options for a shoot and Miranda chooses. She chooses every single thing in every single issue. Run-throughs are a huge deal.No. Sometimes it's busy.After the loo, Serena and I are going to lunch. This is her. The new me.I told you.Oh, no. I was quite serious.I get twenty minutes for lunch, you get fifteen. When I come back, you can go.They also need flip flops.Yes.Excuse me, where do you think you--I have no idea why Miranda hired her.I knew from the moment I saw her that she was a complete and utter----disaster.Guard this with your life.Yeah. Whoopee. Okay, now, it's very important that you do EXACTLY what I'm about to tell you.The Book is assembled by 10 or 10:30, so you must wait around until then.You'll be delivering Miranda's dry cleaning with the book.The driver will take you to Miranda's townhouse.Let yourself in.Do not talk to anyone. Do not look at anyone. That is of the utmost importance. You must be invisible. Do you understand?Open the door, walk across the foyer, then hang the dry cleaning in the closet across from the staircase.And leave the Book on the table with the flowers.You went upstairs? Oh my God. Why didn't you just climb into bed with her and ask for a bedtime story?Don't you understand? If you get fired, that might jeopardize Paris for me. And if that happens, I will search every Blimpie's in the tri-state area until I find you and kill you.I don't know. She's not happy.Oh look, you're getting paranoid. Yay. It's not just me. Listen, don't freak out. There could be a silver lining here.When Miranda gives someone an impossible task, it generally means one of two things. One, she thinks you can actually pull it off.Or, you know, that thing you were saying about the cat.You know, I rarely say this to people who aren't me, but you need to calm down.Tonight's the benefit. I've been looking forward to it for MONTHS. I refuse to be sick. I'm wearing Valentino. Everyone's going to be leaving to get dressed soon, so after you drop off Miranda's Fendi bag at the re-beaders, you can just go home.I don't see why she needs both of us.These are all the guests. Miranda invites everyone. We have to make sure they all think she knows exactly who they are. I've been studying for weeks.Don't be silly.You have to learn these too. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05Oh my God, Andy. You look... chic.Do I? It's for Paris. I'm on a new diet. I don't eat anything, and then, when I feel like I'm about to faint, I eat a cube of cheese.I know. I'm just one stomach flu away from my goal weight.Ready?We need to make sure we're there the second she walks in.There she is.John Folger. New artistic director, Circle in the Square.She knows him.That's... Wait... I know who that is... It's...Thanks.Yes. Oh my God. Miranda hates her. She was supposed to arrive after Miranda left...You can go. I've got it from here.Go. Have fun.Everything okay?Sorry I'm late. Miranda wanted some scarves from Hermes and she told me yesterday but I forgot and so--I freaked out of course, but then I just called Martine at home and she opened the store early, so I got them.I hope it's not another Miranda problem--Good. Because I've got so much to deal with before I go, I swear to God I can't even--I don't care if she was going to fire you or beat you with a red hot poker, you should have said no.Oh, please. That's a pathetic excuse.What gets me about this whole thing is, you're the one who pretends you don't care about this stuff. You don't care about fashion, you just want to be a journalist, blah, blah, blah. What a load of bollocks.Face it, Andy. You sold your soul the day you put on your first pair of Jimmy Choos.And you know what really kills me? The clothes you're about to get. You don't deserve them. You eat carbs, for Christ's sake. It's so unfair. Just go.I said, go!My God, you call this a letter? Can you spell any word in the English language?Miranda Priestly's office.You're joking. YOU have a favor to ask of ME?Well, I don't know. It is a huge imposition, but I suppose I could help you out... I'll have Roy pick them up this afternoon.Why can't you be more like Andy?It should be there any second.", "clean_line": "andrea sachs human resources certainly bizarre sense humor follow okay miranda second assistant assistant recently got promoted trying miranda sacked girls weeks need survive understand ask editor chief runway mention legend work year job magazine want million girls kill job andrea runway fashion magazine fashion crucial oh god way tell driver text messaged facialist ruptured disk god people talk oh stay want walking past sit ll pray notice marring area sorry miranda confirm night right human resources sent assistant job pre interviewing wants andrea miranda decided kill autumn jacket story september pulling sedona shoot october need office right second pick coffee order way write hope know difficult job totally wrong mess head chopping block okay answer phones phone answered single time rings phones roll voicemail gets upset chained desk time assistant left desk sliced hand open letter opener miranda missed lagerfeld right boarded hour flight australia works tv guide miranda priestly office available ll tell called remember totally different jobs run errands coffee etcetera charge schedule expenses appointments importantly paris fashion week fall wear couture shows parties meet designers divine okay stay going art department book book mock current issue deliver miranda apartment night returns morning notes second assistant supposed miranda private like strangers going house decides psycho lovely task waiting book idea miranda priestly calling patrick skirts kind color shape fabric ask miranda right ll care stuff calvin klein sorry prior commitment hideous pants convention going store catching quickly send assistants designer home day going showroom ll address good god circumstances public transportation miranda needs hermes pick scarves ordered cassidy forgot homework dalton pick miranda went meet meisel ll want starbucks gets oh god took long pee coat prepared run people panicking phone going ringing hook editors bring options shoot miranda chooses chooses single thing single issue run throughs huge deal busy loo serena going lunch new told oh minutes lunch come need flip flops yes excuse think idea miranda hired knew moment saw complete utter disaster guard life yeah whoopee okay important exactly tell book assembled wait ll delivering miranda dry cleaning book driver miranda townhouse let talk look utmost importance invisible understand open door walk foyer hang dry cleaning closet staircase leave book table flowers went upstairs oh god climb bed ask bedtime story understand fired jeopardize paris happens search blimpie tri state area kill know happy oh look getting paranoid yay listen freak silver lining miranda gives impossible task generally means things thinks actually pull know thing saying cat know rarely people aren need calm tonight benefit ve looking forward months refuse sick wearing valentino going leaving dressed soon drop miranda fendi bag beaders home needs guests miranda invites sure think knows exactly ve studying weeks silly learn devil wears prada nd blue progress oh god andy look chic paris new diet eat feel like faint eat cube cheese know stomach flu away goal weight ready need sure second walks john folger new artistic director circle square knows wait know thanks yes oh god miranda hates supposed arrive miranda left ve got fun okay sorry late miranda wanted scarves hermes told yesterday forgot freaked course called martine home opened store early got hope miranda problem good ve got deal swear god care going beat red hot poker said oh pathetic excuse gets thing pretends care stuff care fashion want journalist blah blah blah load bollocks face andy sold soul day pair jimmy choos know kills clothes deserve eat carbs christ sake unfair said god letter spell word english language miranda priestly office joking favor ask know huge imposition suppose help ll roy pick afternoon like andy second"}, "MIRANDA": {"raw_line": "I don't understand why it's so difficult to confirm an appointment.The details of your incompetence do not interest me.Tell Simone I'm not approving the girl she sent in for the Brazil layout. I wanted clean, athletic, and smiling not dirty, tired and paunchy...RSVP yes to the Michael Kors party -- the car will drop me at 9:30 and wait until I leave at 9:45... Tell Natalie at Glorious Foods for the fortieth time -- no, I don't want the tortes filled with warm rhubarb compote. I want the chopped almonds.Call my ex-husband and remind him the Parent-Teacher conferences at Dalton are tonight. Then call my husband and tell him to meet me for dinner at that place I went with Massimo...And tell Richard I saw the pictures of for the feature on female paramedics and they're all so unattractive. I don't understand. How hard is it to find a decent-looking paramedic?... Also, I need to see what Nigel has called in for Gwyneth's second cover try...Who is that?I'll do it. The last two you sent me were total disappointments. Send her in.Who are you?What are you doing here?So you don't read Runway?And before today, you had never heard of me?And you have no style or sense of fashion.That wasn't a question.That's all.Is there a reason my coffee is not here? Was I unclear in some way?Emily!Emily!It's too dark. I can't see any of the clothes...And what is this? I want the title of the layout to bleed over the left side of the photo...No, no, no. That's not what I want. I made that abundantly clear...There you are, Emily. How many times do I have to scream your name?What a fantastic story. So entertaining and full of useful information.I need ten or fifteen skirts from Calvin Klein...Please bore someone else with your questions. Make sure we can get Pier 59 at 8 am tomorrow... Remind Jocelyn I want to see a few of those satchels Marc is doing in the pony... And tell Simone I'll take Frankie if Maggie is not available tomorrow... And did Demarchelier confirm?Get him on the phone.And Emily.Do you have Demarchelier?Are you there?What do they have?Who's there? Who are you dealing with?Get away from her. She is useless and unattractive. Ask for Ivan, tell him we're doing a reshoot tomorrow and need at least ten skirts.No... No... No... I swear I don't understand why it's so difficult for you to pull together a decent run- through. You had hours to prepare... Where are all the advertisers?We need more.What do you think?Is it too much like the--Where are the belts for this skirt?Is something funny?This... stuff? Okay. I understand. You think this has nothing to do with you. You go to your closet and select, say, that lumpy blue sweater because you're trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what's on your body. What you don't know is that your sweater is not blue. It's not even sky blue. It's cerulean. You also don't know that in 2002, De La Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns, Yves St. Laurent showed a cerulean military jacket, Dolce did skirts with cerulean beads, and in our September issue we did the definitive layout on the color. Cerulean quickly appeared in eight other major collections, then the secondary and department store lines and then trickled down to some lovely Casual Corner, where you no doubt stumbled on it.That color is worth millions of dollars and many jobs. And here you are, thinking you've made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry. In truth, you are wearing a sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room. From a pile of stuff.That's all.Get me Isaac.These eggs are frigid.Pick up the Polaroids from the swimwear shoot.The brakes in my car are making a weird noise. Take it in.We need the hat from the finale of the Zac Posen show. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05The girls need new boogieboards for spring break.Pick up my shoes from Manolo....and while you're out, get Patricia.Get me Isaac!My flight is cancelled... Some absurd weather problem.I have to get home. Tonight. The twins have a recital at school tomorrow morning.Please. It's just drizzling. Someone must be getting out. Call Donatella and get her jet. Call everyone with a jet -- Irv, Armani...Emily. Stop making excuses. GET ME HOME.The girls' recital was wonderful. They played Rachmaninoff and everyone loved it. Except for me... because I was not there.Do you know why I hired you?I always hire the same girl, stylish, slender, worships the magazine. And often they turn out to be disappointing and stupid.But you, with your fancy resume and your big speech about your so-called work ethic-- I thought you would be different. I thought, go ahead, take a chance, hire the smart, fat girl.I had hope. I always have hope. But you're as disappointing as anyone else.That's all.The gowns are fabulous, Ralph. We're using the burgundy for the cover try and the lemon chiffon for the goddess story.Emily!Call James Holt's office. Tell them I want to move the preview to today at 12:30. And tell everyone else. Be ready to leave in half an hour.Just let us out here.Yes. I did.Thank you.Make sure you confirm my dinner with--And I need to see the look book for the November denim shoot.Fine.Oh, and you'll be bringing The Book to my home tonight. Emily will give you the key, Andrea. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05What did you want me to do? Walk out in the middle of a photo shoot?We were in a loft near the Seaport. My phone didn't work. I told you.An-dre-a.I need the new Harry Potter book for the twins.Did you fall down and smack your little head on the pavement?We have all the published Harry Potter books. The girls want to know what happens next.We know everyone in publishing. Shouldn't be a problem. You can do anything, right?My girls are leaving on the train to their Grandmother's at 3. They'll need the book by then.I'd like my steak in fifteen minutes.What is that doing here? I ordered it ages ago.Luckily, before I starved to death, Irv invited me to lunch. Get rid of that. I'll be back at 3. Please have my Starbucks order waiting.And if you don't have the Harry Potter book by then, don't come back.One copy? What are my twins supposed to do with that... share?And where exactly are those fabulous copies? I don't see them anywhere.Perfect. What about the accessories pages for April?We did that two years ago. What else?Florals. For spring. Groundbreaking.No.No.Anyone have anything I can actually use?I want to make sure before the benefit that you are both fully prepped on the guest list.Only when the first assistant hasn't decided to be disgustingly ill. You'll come and help Emily.John. Good to see you.Massimo, you made it. I was worried you'd be too busy with your new factory in Ortezzano--Emily?Ambassador, Rebecca.Ah, Bonsoir, Cherie. Ta robe est rudement chouette.Thank you for coming to our little get together tonight.And we're all so grateful.Darling, there you are.Come on, darling, let's get something to eat. I'm starved, aren't you?Andrea. Come up here.Paris is the most important week of my year. I need the best team possible with me.That no longer includes Emily.If you don't go, I'll assume you're not serious about your future at Runway or any other publication.The decision is yours.That's all.Don't forget to tell Emily.There you are. We need to go over the seating chart for the luncheon.By all means, move at a glacial pace. You know how that thrills me.Okay, so, first of all, let's put Jay- Z at my table.Stephen won't be coming.Well, if you speak to him and he decides to rethink the divorce, then \"fetch\" him. Fetch away.When we get back to New York, we'll need to think of a way to keep it out of the press.Another divorce in the papers... and we all know what they'll say about me - - Dragon Lady, career-obsessed, drove away another \"Mr. Priestly\".He knew who I was, you know. They all did. And at first they're always proud to be with a powerful, accomplished woman. That's what they say. But then...I don't care what anyone says about me, of course. But it's so unfair to the girls... another disappointment, another stepfather, gone...I mean, the point is--We really need to figure out where to put Donatella because she's barely speaking to anyone.Don't be ridiculous... why would you do that?Your job.Go.Excuse me?Excuse us a moment.Have you lost your mind?Do not disturb me again.Are those freesias?If I see freesia anywhere, I will be very disappointed.Thank you everyone. Before I talk to you about James and everything he's accomplished, I have news.Tonight is not just an important night for me, for Runway, and for James, it's also important for someone else in this room...As of next month, James will be partnering with CFG in an expansion of his line.James and Runway have one important thing in common -- a commitment to excellence.And so it comes as no surprise that James has selected someone from the Runway family as the new copresident of JH International...My esteemed colleague, Jacqueline Follet.Let's wish Jacqueline the best as she pursues this wonderful opportunity.And now to the business at hand. A celebration of one of my favorite designers...I'm ready to go.You thought I didn't know.I've known what was happening for quite some time. It took a little while to find a suitable alternative for Jacqueline, one she would accept. Turned out, that James Holt job is so absurdly overpaid----she jumped at it.Then I let Irv know Jacqueline was unavailable.Truth is, there's no one who can do what I do, her included.Any of his other choices would find the job impossible and the magazine would surely suffer. Especially because of the list----designers, photographers, editors, writers, models, all of whom were found and nurtured by me......all of whom have promised to follow me whenever and if ever I leave Runway. To any publication I choose. Of course, as soon as Irv understood, he reconsidered.I must say, I was impressed with you, how intently you tried to warn me.I never thought I would say this, Andrea, but I see some of myself in you. Your dedication, your focus.People think success happens to you. It doesn't. You choose it. Every day, I choose excellence. Who else does what I do, at my level? Nobody. They don't even understand what it takes, the days, measured in milliseconds...But now you know --and I know -- that you have it in you. That you can see beyond what other people want and choose for yourself.Of course you can. You already did. To Emily.No. You did choose. You chose to get ahead. You want this life, those choices are necessary.Don't be silly, Andrea. This is what everyone wants. Everyone wants to be us....I don't understand why it's so challenging to get a car when I ask for one.", "clean_line": "understand difficult confirm appointment details incompetence tell simone
