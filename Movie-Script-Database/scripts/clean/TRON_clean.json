Thanks for coming back early.It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.Yes. It felt like Flynn.I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.End of line.Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program out of the system. And get me those Chinese language program I asked for.You shouldn't have come back, Flynn.That isn't going to do you any good, Flynn. I'm afraid you...Stop, Flynn. You realize I can't allow this.You're entering a big error, Flynn... I'm going to have to put you on the Game Grid.SARK, ES-1117821. Open communication.I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together! Humans they can't even keen their social order in one pieceYou rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.End of line.I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays \"Happy Birthday\" to its User once a year.Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.I don't have time, Sark. And neither do you. End of line.I am delighted that so many of you could turn out to give your power over to me...You're very lucky, all of you. You are participating in the creation of the single most powerful program in the history of the system... of all systems...A program with a will... with ambition... a superior form of life...Welcome!Dumont, I'm so pleased that we've finally come to terms with one another...It is very good that you...Sark!

You never were much for small talk. She still leave her clothes all over the floor?Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here.

No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.You haven't told him?Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called... ...Space Paranoids.Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has \"invented\" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.My password ... Dillinger's instruction to divert the data ...Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...Hi, Alan.My dinner.Want one?Move aside. Let the kid have some room.Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...Hey hey, it's that big Master Control Program everybody's talking about... You don't look a thing like your pictures... Tell me, have you really been thinking about world domination like they say? CODE SERIES LSU-123 ... activate. CODE SERIES ESS-999 ... activate. CODE SERIES HHH-888 ... activate.Now, how do you expect to run the universe if you let a few unsolvable problems throw you like that? C'mon, big boy, let's see what...Games, huh? I'll give you --Oh, man... this isn't happening. It only thinks it's happening...Hey! Take it easy! Look, if this is about those parking tickets, I can explain everything...Who you callin' \"program,\" program?Hey! Who are you guys? What's the story around here?Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody.Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?Yeah, yeah -- that's great.Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...Looks like we're in the same boat here -No, IHey!Okay!Here's an easy one...No!No!Out of my way, zero bit.Tron...?Alan!Well, isn't it -- ?I, uh... I'm a program from a User that... knows Alan...?Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCPI know...You guys...follow me.Watch it!Oh man...when you're on the other side of the screen...it all looks so easy...It's all circuits... Must be an input/output component...Well...my home \"sector\" was called Paramus ...It grows on you.Feel what? You okay?Hey, what's that?well... when do we pay a call on the ol' Master Control?You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad.
