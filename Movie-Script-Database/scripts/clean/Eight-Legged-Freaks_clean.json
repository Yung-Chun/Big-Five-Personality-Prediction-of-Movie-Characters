{"Eight-Legged-Freaks": {"CHRIS": {"raw_line": "Damn.Hope you like bologna!Oh, great.Right on.I've warned you not to talk about my family!My family built this town!Stay out of this, Sam!Did you hear what he said?Those mines are full of gas. One spark in the wrong place could blow this entire valley sky high. Do you really want to load that gun with toxic waste?How could they run tests? I didn't give them permission to go into the mines.I asked you a question, you greedy son of a bitch!You're taking his side?He wasn't crazy.He had it comin'. But Sam Palmer... That woman abuses her power.I'm not proud of it.I thought you were trying the patch.That burner's on the fritz again.Today... For a split second... I actually thought I had it.Yeah... Then a rat stole my lunch. I practically blew myself up trying to get it back.What are you saying?You of all people know how much my dad wanted to find that mother lode.And maybe you didn't know him so well after all.Don't give up on me, Gladys. I promised him I'd find the gold. And I will.What am I, the Pied Piper...Need some rat traps.What is all this?I'll have mine without Nicotine.Rats...Have you been smoking?Gladys...She really has it in for me.What?Me and Sam... Hook up...Too much information.This is where I throw up.I'm sorry about yesterday. Wade is... He knows how to push my buttons.On a date?I'm kidding. What did you want to ask?Define strange.How about stampeding rats?Could have been. Never saw them do that before. I guess it qualifies as strange.Sam... Do you want to go out sometime?Only if you're going to say yes.So that's a 'No.'No... I understand... I don't know what I was thinking... Gladys has some crazy ideas. I'm gonna kill her.No! Let me go! Gladys! Let me go!She was cooking. The stove was broken.Gladys is dead.It's a little large.They keep their food alive.If there were giant spiders roaming the desert, don't you think somebody would've seen them by now?That one looks kind of scratchy.Gladys thought I should sell... but you know... I never wanted to get rich. If it was about the money, I would have sold out to Wade a long time ago.I think I just wanted to prove the gold was down there. That my family wasn't crazy to keep looking. Even after we'd lost so much. And now... she's gone, too.Do you know what I'm trying to say?That's right. That's exactly right.Remind me never to let you do my laundry.I'll keep that in mind.How am I supposed to do that!?I'm gonna need some new pants.I'm a fast learner.What other spiders did Joshua have?Why couldn't he keep goldfish like a normal person?How about the radio station?What are you going to say? You can't tell them the truth.The mall?Let's try for the mall.My truck's at the museum.In my other pants.What?Keep going!We're sealed up at both ends.Like that?Then at daybreak they'll go back inside. We can walk out the front door.Radio Shack is full of cell phones.I'll cover you, Harlan.While I'm gone, do you think you could find me a size 32?Don't even think about locking this door.It looks clear.We've got company!This always looks so easy on TV!They're coming!No! Don't say that!What happened?What a shock! Try again!Climb!I've got you!No!You're going down!We're on our own!We should be able to hold them off for a little while.What the hell?We can get out this way!Cover me!At least they can't follow us.I think we're in one of the old tunnels.Don't worry, Sam.I don't believe it...Toxic waste.We can get out this way!You did this?We're wasting time.One end of these lights should be connected to a generator. That'll be near the entrance.Methane. This cavern is full of gas.One spark and we're all dead.There's somebody in here!Gladys!Gladys, please... Can anybody help her?!It's okay. It's okay.You're okay.No...Jesus... it's the mother lode... He was right. My dad was right...Consuela?Go!Leave it!Bret, come on!This is our chance to kill them all.When the power comes on, the bulb will ignite the methane and torch them!Keep going up the tunnel. There should be a generator at the exit. Start it up and await for my signal to throw the switch.Will be buried under tons of rock! Go!I need to set the fuse as close to the spiders as I can. That should give us time to get clear.Bingo.I hate spiders.Start the generator!Throw the switch!No! It's a chain reaction!

Off the bikes.I told you not to act like kamikazes. Especially with Ashley riding behind. That is unacceptable, Bret.You just bought yourself a reckless.Get in the car, Ashley. Now.Over my dead body.The next time you put my daughter's life in danger, I'll show you exactly how little that means to me.I want both wheels on the ground.I can always count on you, Mike.This bad girl act doesn't suit you, Ash.That's what scares me.I told you to keep this with you.A mother's job is to protect her children.I'd like to. But you keep skipping classes to go to the dunes with Bret.I don't hate him. I just want you to have a future. I thought you wanted to get out of town. Go to med school.Thanks for the flashback.Uh-oh.That's enough!I heard.Let's all calm down.Don't take another step.I'm trying to keep the peace.It's okay.What are you talking about?Where did you learn that it's okay to talk to me like this?Work it, babe.It's all yours.You still want a ride, Mike?Have fun.Now what?Quiet! Quiet please!I had spiders at my house too. We need an exterminator not a sheriff.I don't know, Travis. We're gonna keep an eye out. But we're not gettin' anywhere like this. You should go back out there and look for your animals. If they haven't shown up by tonight. I'll call Fish and Game. Okay?I can't do this right now, Mike! Everyone's having pest problems!Maybe he's out looking for his spiders?Mike... I've got missing pets. Spiders in the plumbing. Rats and mice coming out of basements. And your sister's about to end up on a milk carton. I can't have you losing...Hello? Wade... wait a second... your ostriches?Coyotes?All this happened last night?What about him?How's the ostrich business?You've got that new Hummer. You must be makin' enough to pay for it.These birds are insured. Right?Come on, Mike. Let's hit it.If I find anything I'll let you know. So you can fill out that insurance form.Mike?What are you talking about?Have you been overdosing your Ritalin?Nothing yet. I'm sorry. We're still trying to get...Let me call you back. This has been one crazy day. We've got missing pets, dead ostriches. God only knows what's next.I wanted to ask you...Have you noticed anything strange in the mines?I had spiders in my house. Hector had roaches in his basement. Some mice...Were they running away from something?Are you asking me out on a date?My kids are the world to me, Chris. When their dad left... it really took a toll. On all of us. I can't go through that again. I won't.Maybe she got out.Why don't you come home with me? We'll get you cleaned up.Is Bret here?Then why is his truck out front?What do you mean? What happened?Mike, please. Now isn't the time.What is this?No. That's a piece of cactus. Look... It's covered with spines.Giant tarantulas?I guess I should watch more 'Oprah.' It must be a textbook 'no-dad' kind of thing.All Jason cared about was getting out and starting over. I guess that included buying a new wardrobe.I'm sorry, Chris.It wasn't about spending the gold, it was about finding it.They look great.Ever used one of these?I'm sorry I didn't believe you.Calm down, baby.I won't let anything happen to you.We need to warn people.Good one. We'll go to Harlan's.It's okay...We need to make an emergency broadcast.Is this thing on? Hello? This is Sam Palmer. We have an emergency situation.A pack of rabid coyotes is loose in town.They are extremely dangerous.Arm yourselves with any weapons you can find.Stay together and head for the mall.The walls are concrete and the exits have steel gates. We could hold an entire army of giant spiders from inside.Not giant spiders! I meant to say...Your keys?Go ahead. I've got your butt.Your back! I've got your back!How can we spot them?Open this goddamn door!The gates! Close the gates!Shut the other entrances!You pump the slide to jack in a fresh round. Point at your target and squeeze.Try not to cut yourself.Me?I don't have that many handcuffs.You're not goin' back out there, Pete. None of us are.Are you sure you can handle this?I'll do my best. Uhh... Do you want to go out sometime? Dinner? Maybe a movie?No way.Let's stay together, guys.Move it!Oh my God...Ashley! Mike!Did you get help?! Is anybody coming!?Chris!Not today.What are you going to do?!Hurry!Hold that thought.Which way do we go?Can you get us out of here?Where did you see it, Mike?You put all of us at risk.I think our lives are worth a little more than that.That one just moved!Is it real?You saved my life.Spiders!We have to get out!Where did you get an idea like that!?And the toxic waste...What about you?He has a cute butt.
