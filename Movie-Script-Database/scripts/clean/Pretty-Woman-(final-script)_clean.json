Call me.Just call me.Uh, hi. I'm Philip Stuckey, Edward Lewis's lawyer.Well, if I know this fellow, he's probably off in a corner somewhere charming a very pretty lady.How are you ?Do you ?Wonderful.Excuse me.Edward, where you going ?Why, what's wrong with the limo ?Mmm.All right, look. I don't think you should drive. You're a little excited. Don't drive my car. Let me work something out here.Fellas, what kind of a system is this ? Can you move these cars out of here ?Look, Edward. Edward... Uh, are you familiar with a stick shift ?Have you driven a shift ?Listen, all right. Just be ginger with it. Don't...It's a new car. Don't, uh... Just don't...Edward ! Give me a break, please !I love it too. Look, you don't even know where you're going. You're gonna get lost in the dark !Beverly Hills is down the hill !He wants to meet you face to face, hmm...Oh, Edward, Edward. I... Look, it's really not a good idea that you see him.Definitely not alone.Oh, God. What ?What ? What does that mean ?Edward, it's Phil. Listen, I'm running out the door.He's grooming him to take over. I don't know.Look, I gotta say this again. I don't like you going alone, you know.Yeah... listen.Edward, we just got the Morse update. Don, can you hold the projection, please ?Yeah, what ? Speak.Navy contract. I can't believe this shit. I thought you said they had nothing in the hopper on this one !Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.Walk away ? Hey, forget it, pal. We got a thousand man- hours in on this ! Nobody's walking away from anything !Senator Adams.I don't understand what's going on here today, gentlemen.Listen, everything all set for the meeting tonight ?Who... Who is this girl you're going with ?Oh, Edward, Edward. Where the hell are you ? The word's all over the street.I don't know. He, uh... I think he's throwing in with the employees.Yeah, okay. You got it.Fellas, let's finish this up this afternoon, huh ?Jake, set something up with Blair. Around two o'clock, two- thirty, would be good.You were right about Morse. He mortgaged everything he owns, right down to his underwear, to secure a loan from the bank.And it's not just any bank. Plymouth Trust, huh ?So, it goes without saying... that your business means a lot more to them than our friend, Mr. Morse. So, all you gotta do is call the bank.Edward, excuse me for saying this, but what the hell is wrong with you this week ? Are you giving Morse a chance to get away ?What ?So, I liked Monopoly. Boardwalk, Park Place. Wh-What's the point ?We make money, Edward. We worked for a year on this deal. It's what you said you wanted. I'm handing it to you.Morse's jugular is exposed. It's time for the kill. Let's finish this. Call the bank !Watch where you're walking, because, if you step in something, we're not going back in the car.Not too near the tree. I don't like the ants.Hello. Have you seen Edward anywhere ?Excuse me. Edward !Edward. Over here.Ah, good to see you.Well, hi. Philip Stuckey, Vivian. This is my wife, Elizabeth.Sort of an aerobics queen. Feel the burns. Well, let me get you something to drink. Vivian, why don't you start with that. Okay ?I'll be right back. Did you notice Senator Adams is here ?That is why I have pledged my eternal love to you. Mmm !Edward's date.Uh-huh.Have fun.Oh, so you just ran into her ? That's great, Jesus !So anyway, what does she do ? Does she... does she work ?Sales ? That's terrific. That's good. What does she sell ?Now just hear me out on this, okay ? I've known you a long time. I... I see some differences in you this week, like the tie, and, uh... I'm wondering if maybe this girl isn't the difference, especially when I see her talking to David Morse.I mean, this girl appears from out of nowhere. Now she's talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy. That's a little convenient, don't you think ?Edward, how... how do you know that this girl... hasn't attached herself to you because she's bringing information back to Morse ? This happens ! Industrial espionage...What ?Oh !Oh, you are...Oh, man !You know, you're the only millionaire I ever heard of... who goes looking for a bargain basement streetwalker, you know ?Having a nice time, Vivian ?Must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard, hmm ? She stops smiling and shows a very sad and worried face.Yeah, Edward told me. But don't worry : you're secret is safe with me. Listen, maybe, uh, you and I could get together sometime......after Edward leaves.We'll just have to do that, hmm ?No, I don't want to talk to him now. Tell him I'll call him on Monday.Where are you going ? Did he sign these ?He had to...Edward, you can't disappear now. We're in this too deep.Where are you going ?With the hooker ?What'd he say ?He's taking the day off ?I just got off the phone with James Morse. Get this.Edward, I think we got him. His nuts are on the block. We got him !Mr. Morse, you said this morning you wished to speak to Mr. Lewis. Mr. Lewis is now listening.It's not a problem. They'll be taken care of. Well, then, gentlemen. If we could address ourselves to the contracts in front of you. If you look at...All right, gentlemen, you heard the man. Please wait outside. All the assistants stand up to leave the room.What do you mean ?Why does he get to stay ?I'll be right outside.Edward, please, what was this all about ? Hmm ?Well, well. Hello again. I'm looking for Edward.No. Uh, Edward is definitely not with me.No, if Edward were with me...When. Actually, when... Edward was with me, he didn't blow off billion dollar deals !I think that, uh, Edward's with you. That's what I think. Mind if I have a drink ?Well, I'll just wait.You know...You're a hooker. Maybe you're a very good hooker, you know ? She puts her notebook on the low table.Maybe if I do you, then I wouldn't care about losing millions of dollars. Because I have to be very honest with you right now, Vivian.Right now I really do care. I really do. And right now I am really pissed, you know ?Right now I am just freaking out. So maybe if I screw you, huh......and take you to the opera, then I could be a happy guy, just like Edward.Hey, hey ! Goddamn it !Ow !Come on ! Come on ! I'll pay for it.How much is it ? Twenty bucks, thirty bucks ?Fifty ? You a fifty dollars whore, Vivian ?What are you doing ? Get off !I don't know how to tell you this.

Ballpark.A hundred dollars a night ?An hour ? You make a hundred dollars an hour and you got a safety pin holding your boot up ? You gotta be joking.Neither do I. Hundred dollars an hour. Pretty stiff.I... I hope not !Yeah. He looks at her for a couple of second, before talking again.So you'll be all right ?Go back to your office.Well, thanks for the ride.Good-bye.I was thinking... Did you really say a hundred dollars an hour ?Yeah... Well, if you don't have any prior engagements, I'd be very pleased if you would accompany me into the hotel.Edward.No ?!Why don't you put this on ?Well, this hotel is not the kind of establishment that rents rooms by the hour.You're gonna be fine. Come with me. And stop fidgeting. Another medium shots on seated guests staring at the couple.Hello. You have messages ?Thank you.Could you send up some champagne and strawberries, please ?First time in an elevator.Try.Yes.To the left.Oh, I miss keys.Impressed ?Sure they do. Edward has been taking a newspaper left by an attendant on a small table near the front door. He crosses the room and and drops the newspaper on the desk. He sits down behind the desk, and starts looking through his mail, while Vivian walks out on the terrace.I'll take your word for it, because I don't go out there.I'm afraid of heights.It's the best. I looked all around for penthouses on the first floor, but I can't find one.Want to know something ? I don't have a clue.I hadn't exactly planned this.Always.Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Uh, I assume cash is acceptable.You're on my fax.Cute. Very cute. Thank you.A buffet of safety.No, no.

Here you go. Thank you very much.Don't worry about it. Edward sets the champagne glasses on the bar.Not at all.I have both.My ex-wife... is now in Long Island... in my ex-home... with my ex-dog.There you go.My ex-girlfriend, Jessica, is in New York... moving out of my apartment even as we speak.Why don't you try a strawberry ?It brings out the flavor in the champagne.No.Somehow I'm sensing that this time problem is a major issue with you.Why don't we just get through that right now ?How much for the entire night ?Try me.Done. Thank you. Now we can relax.To tell you the truth, I don't feel like being alone tonight.No.I bet you have.I don't know. I really don't know.I didn't hear you. What did you say ? Vivian hides something behind her back, but her hand in her back can be seen in one of the bathroom mirror.What is... What do you have in, uh, your hand there ? What are you hiding ?All right, look. I do not want any drugs here. I don't want any of this. Get your things and your money and please leave. She gets rid of his hand.What is this ? What is this ?This is dental floss.I'm sorry. Please continue.No, I'm going. He gives the handbag back to her.It's just that, uh, very few people surprise me.I'm going. He closes the door. Vivian starts cleaning her teeth with dental floss.Uh-huh. I've got them from London. I need them now from Tokyo. I'll call down and get them when I want them. Thank you very much.I'm high on life. Can't you tell ?What do you do ?Neither do I.Of course Morse is going to fight. It's to be expected. He's run his company for a very long time now. I don't think he's ready to have his name taken off the stationery.Sure, you wouldn't. But do it anyhow. Tonight. Dinner. Set it up.Well, you know, there's always a possibility things are gonna go wrong.That's why I enjoy this so much. Oh, by the way, Phil, about your car.It corners like it's on rails.Well, good morning.Better.No, there's no hurry. Are you hungry ? You must be.Why don't you sit and have something to eat ?I, uh, took the liberty of ordering everything on the menu.I didn't know what you'd like.All right ? Good.Did you sleep well ?Occupational hazard ?Uh, yes, a little, on the couch.I was, uh, working last night.That's right.There are four other chairs here.I buy companies.Uh, I buy companies that are in financial difficulty.Well, the company I'm buying this week, I'm getting for the bargain price of about one billion.Yes.I went all the way.No, I get some of it from banks, investors. It's not an easy thing to do.No.No.I sell them.Well, I... don't sell the whole company. I break it up into pieces... and then I sell that off. It's worth more than the whole. Close Up shot on Edward's necktie, and Vivian's hands knotting it.Yeah, sort of. But legal.Mm-hmm.Not bad. Not bad at all. Where'd you learn to do that ?Not at all. Just stay in the shallow end. He goes out of the bathroom, followed, a couple of seconds later, by Vivian.Oh, that's good.Ah, yes. Very intense young man named David. He plays polo.Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm here.Housekeeping is singing.No, you don't.Besides, I already have one.You just concentrate on finding out what Morse is up to.I'm on my way.More than life itself.Vivian, I have a business proposition for you.I'm gonna be in town until Sunday. I'd like you to spend the week with me.Yes. Yes, I'd like to hire you as an employee. Would you consider spending the week with me ?I will pay you to be at my beck and call.I want a professional. I don't need any romantic hassles this week.Oh, yes, of course !All right, here we go. Give me a ballpark figure. How much ?Six nights at three hundred is eighteen hundred.Two thousand.Done.Vivian ?Vivian, is that a yes ?I'll be gone most of the day. I want you to buy some clothes.We may be going out evenings. You'll need something to wear.Uh, nothing too flashy. Not too sexy.Conservative. You understand ?Elegant. Any questions ?Not if you expect me to answer.I would've paid four. I'll see you tonight.Three thousand for six days. And, Vivian, I will let you go.Gentlemen, relax !Relax ! Who do we know on the Senate Appropriations Committee ?All right, Senator Adams. Let's find out where he is.The Navy's not going to spend 350 million dollar on anything without going to Appropriations first.That's why I hired you, Phil, to do my worrying for me.I'll be in your office. Bob, if you want to send over the geologicals ?Thank you.Mm-hmm. We hear faint voices coming from the meeting room.Nobody you know.Never, ever pick up the phone.I'll be in the hotel lobby, 7:45 sharp.This isn't a date. It's business.I'm taking you to a restaurant called the Voltaire.Well, thank you very much.Yes, tell him I'm in the middle of a very important phone call.Uh-huh. Excuse me, I just want to make one call.From who ?My what ?Oh. Hmm.I think we both know that she's not my niece.The reason I know that is that I am an only child.What's the message ?Intriguing.Thank you, Mr... ?You're stunning.Shall we go to dinner ?Stop fidgeting. Closer high angle shot of Vivian and Edward walking toward a table where two men, an old one and a younger one, are already seated.Mr. Morse.I'm pleased to meet you both. This is a friend of mine, Vivian Ward.Mr. Morse. David.Please, sit.Where are you going ?Upstairs, to the right.Shall I order for you ?I'll do that.Uh, the salad comes at the end of the meal.These are escargot. It's French for snails. It's a delicacy. Try it. David ?Break it up and sell off the pieces.Carter.No, I have the franchise on that.I doubt it. It doesn't really matter now. He passed away.Mr. Morse, you asked for this meeting. What can I do for you ?I can't do that. I own ten million shares.You don't have the money.There will be no contract. The contract is now buried in Appropriations Committee. And it will remain there.Yes, yes, I do.I look forward to it, sir.Rich people throw their napkins a lot, don't they ?I guess three thousand dollars does not buy loyalty, does it ?Oh, his grandson thinks he's a relic. He hates that he does, but he does.No, just the two.Not in this building.Well, I'm only halfway out.Thanks for the recap.What I would like is for you to get down from there. You're making me very nervous. Please come down.Vivian, I'm serious. Come... I'm not looking.The truth is, it really is totally irrelevant whether I like this man or not.I will not let myself become emotionally involved in business.Oh, of course, not with me. You and I are such similar creatures, Vivian. We both screw people for money.Last month.I hadn't spoken to him in fourteen and a half years. I wasn't there when he died.No.\u00abVeg out\u00bb ?Look, I'll tell you what. I'll be back. We'll do broccoli tomorrow. He strokes her chin very delicately. She stands up.I'm going downstairs for a while.Thank you. Thank you very much.I only play for strangers.Gentlemen, would you mind leaving us, please ?Thank you.Now, if you have any trouble using this card, have them call the hotel. All right ?Mm-hmm. I'm surprised you didn't buy more than one dress yesterday.Why not ?Mean to you ?They're not looking at you. They're looking at me.Stores are never nice to people. They're nice to credit cards.Okay, stop fidgeting.Get rid of your gum.I don't believe you did that.Yes ?Edward Lewis.You see this young lady over here ?Do you have anything in this shop as beautiful as she is ?Excuse me. You know what we're gonna need here ?We're gonna need a few more people helping us. I'll tell you why. We're going to be spending an obscene amount of money in here. So we're going to need a lot more help sucking up to us. That's what we really like. You understand that.Yeah ?Really offensive.I think we need some major sucking up.Hollister.Not me. Her.He's countering ?He still needs someone to underwrite the paper.You're on your own. I have to go back to work. You look great !She has my card.Hmm.Yeah.You know what I used to love when I was a kid, Phil ?Blocks. Building blocks. Erector sets.We don't build anything, Phil. We don't make anything.Nice tie.Then he divorced my mother to be with another woman. And he took his money with him.It cost me ten thousands dollars in therapy to say that sentence : \u00abI was very angry with him\u00bb. I do it very well, don't I ? I'll say it again. \u00abI was very angry with him\u00bb.Hello, my name is Mr. Lewis. I'm very angry with my father.My father was president of the third company I ever took over. I bought it. I sold it off piece by piece.He said I was cured.Not likely. They don't spend too much time on Hollywood Boulevard.Come on. Let go. Let go.All right. You look great. You look like a lady. You're gonna have a wonderful time.Okay. Don't fidget and smile.This is Gwen and Gretchen, the infamous Olsen sisters, who have made marrying well an art form.Be back in just a second. Hold on.Well done.Business.Yeah.Phil.Me too. I want you to meet a new friend of mine, Vivian Ward.Mm-hmm. I asked him.He's my lawyer. He's all right.Maybe we'll try that later.I spend time with them, yeah.No wonder what ?Uh... I was asking for directions. There she was.She's in sales.Why do you want to know ?Don't be ridiculous.Phil, Phil, Phil ! Phil, listen to me.She's not a spy. She is a hooker.She is a hooker. I picked her up on Hollywood Boulevard. In your car.Yes, yes.I'm sorry I told you.Senator. Senator Adams, I'm pleased you could make it.There's no change, is there ?You all right ?Fine. That's good. Seven \u00abfines\u00bb since we left the match.Could I have another word, please ?I think I liked \u00abfine\u00bb better.Well, for one thing, the clothing was appropriate.I did not... I did not...I'm very sorry. I'm not happy with Stuckey at all for saying or doing that. But he is my attorney. I've known him for ten years.He thought you were some kind of an industrial spy. The guy's paranoid.Look, you're not my toy, I know you're not my toy.Vivian ! Vivian, I'm speaking to you. Come back here !I hate to point out the obvious, but you are, in fact, a hooker ! And you are my employee !I refuse to spend the next three days fighting with you. I said I was sorry. I meant it. That's the end of it !As if you had so many more appealing options.Somehow, I find that very hard to believe. She gets out of the bathroom with her arms full of clothes. She picks up a small handbag and puts it on her shoulder. Then she tries to pick up a larger handbag.Where are you going ?I'm sorry. I wasn't prepared to answer questions about us. It was stupid and cruel. I didn't mean it. I don't want you to go. Will you stay the week ?I saw you talking to David Morse. I didn't like it.I didn't like it.Yes.Mm.So then you chose this as your profession ?You could be so much more.I think you are a very bright, very special woman. Reverse shot on Vivian's face.Don't panic, Philip. Morse isn't going anywhere. I'll be back here in the morning.Did you send the tickets to the hotel ?Thank you.I have a date.Be careful, Philip.Mmm.Something's missing.Well, maybe something in this box. I don't want you to get too excited. This is only on loan.I'm a very good customer.Quarter of a million.It's a surprise.Thank you.When you're not fidgeting, you look very beautiful... and very tall.You don't want to go to San Francisco in a limousine, do you ?No, it's all right. Opening night never starts on time.Thank you.Doris.How nice to see you. Nice to see you.Sir.Wonderful news. Congratulations.It's all right. I've already seen it.Because they're the best.No, thank you.Mm-hmmm.No, no. That's okay It's all right.You'll know. Believe me, you'll understand.The music's very powerful.People's reactions to opera the first time they see it is very dramatic. They either love it or they hate it. If they love it, they will always love it. If they don't, they may learn to appreciate it, but it will never become part of their soul.She said she liked it better than Pirates of Penzance.Yes. Good-bye now.Did you really do that ? Why don't we finish this tomorrow ? It's really late, and I have to work.Me, not work ?I do own the company.I have money. I don't know what a snap dog is, but I have money.Cop a what ?All right, read the first two pages.Okay... Mmm...I was talking to someone.Did you know that two of the Bach pieces that we heard tonight... were found by Felix Mendelssohn in a butcher's shop ? They were wrapping meat with the sheet music.What's with you ? You're fidgeting. What's wrong ?Absolutely.Darryl !You say this is a nice place. I'm sure it's a very nice place.I'll block it with my body.Hi.I don't know. You left and all of a sudden I'm in the middle of West Side Story.Why don't you go to school tomorrow ?Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...I don't believe this. He has this knife coming out of his skateboard. He's going to stab me.What are you gonna do, you gonna strangle me with a Slinky ?All right, okay, this is what's happening. You believe that this person owes you money, right, two hundred dollars ?Why ?His block ?I am not a trick. This is a trick.Darryl ! Left pocket.Isn't that incredible ? And he does have a permit. Thank you, gentlemen.Don't you ever go near her again.The fact that this will be our last night together, and you'll finally be rid of me.My business is almost over, so I'll be going back to New York.I'd really like to see you again.Yes. Yes, I would, so I've arranged for you to have an apartment, to have a car......to have a wide variety of stores guaranteed to suck up to you anytime you want to go shopping. Everything's done.Vivian, it really wouldn't be like that.Well, for one thing, it would get you off the streets.What do you see happening between us ?Yes.What about ?No, it's no good. If he's really caving in, I don't want to wait until this afternoon. Have Morse meet me downtown this morning. Good-bye.I have to go now, but I want you to understand... I heard everything you said. This is all I'm capable of right now. It's a very big step for me.I've never treated you like a prostitute. He looks at her, then walks away toward the front door. Out of his hearing, Vivian whispers :Excuse me, Phil.Gentlemen, I'd like to speak to Mr. Morse alone. Thank you.You too, Phil.I mean I would like to speak to Mr. Morse alone.Please, please.Good.Is that better ?Would you like a cup of coffee ?Mr. Morse, my interests in your company have changed.Well, I no longer wish to buy your company and take it apart. But I don't want anyone else to, either. And it is still extremely vulnerable. So I find myself... in unfamiliar territory. I want to help you.Mr. Morse, I think we can do something very special with your company.Ah, they weren't dead. Just delayed. I... bluffed a little bit.Thank you very much. It's my job.I think we can leave the details up to the others.Thank you. I think we can let in the other suits now.Let's continue the meeting.It's all yours, Phil. Finish it up.You know, I think I'm gonna go for a walk. Just stay here for a while. I'll be back.Stop. I don't want to hurt you ! Stop it !Out. Out of here.Aah ! Damn. Shit. Goddamn !Get out of here.That's bullshit. This is such bullshit ! It's the kill you love, not me ! I made you a very rich man doing exactly what you loved. Now get out of here !Not all guys hit.That was a business decision.It felt good.Yes, I noticed you're packed. Why are you leaving now ?That's not why you're leaving.I know about wanting more. I invented the concept. The question is how much more.Impossible relationships.My special gift is impossible relationships.Thank you.Me too.Do you want me to get you a bellboy ?I'll carry this.Stay. Stay the night with me. And not because I'm paying you, but because you want to.Good-bye.Mmm.Yes. Yes, that's everything.Thank you.You don't have any messages for me, do you ?I'll need a car to the airport also.One last thing.If you could possibly return this to Fred's for me, please.Of course, please. Barney opens the jewel box.Thank you, Mr. Thompson.There you go. Thank you very much.Vivian !Vivian !Had to be the top floor, right ?All right.

Is it all gone, Kit ?I can't believe you bought drugs with our rent. What is going on with you, Kit ? Vivian grabs Kit's arm and makes her stand up.Well, we need rent money !Another 200 dollars ?Work out... Work out what ? What are we gonna work out ? When they are gone, the girl named \u00abAngel\u00bb looks at Carlos.You took it while I was sleeping ?Yeah, well, I have to live there too, Kit.Irritate you ? Irritate you ? I just saw a girl pulled out of a Dumpster.Don't you want to get out of here ?Yes. Sometimes.It's looking really slow tonight.And then he'll run our lives and take our money. No.Do you think I look like Carol Channing ?Wait a minute. That's a Lotus Esprit.Take care of you.Hey, sugar, you looking for a date ?Sure. For five bucks.Price just went up to ten.I can do anything I want to, baby. I ain't lost.For twenty, I'll show you personal. Even show you where the stars live.Right. Uh, down the street.Let's go.Look, I use condoms always. I get checked out once a month at the free clinic. Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I am probably safer.If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.What do you want it to be ?Vivian. My name is Vivian.Man, this baby must corner like it's on rails !Well, doesn't it blow your mind ? This is only four cylinders.Road and Track. The boys back home I grew up with, they were really into American heavy metal : Mustangs, Corvettes.They bought them cheap and fixed them up. I paid attention. So how is it you know so little about cars ?Oh.Milledgeville, Georgia. You know, I think you left your transmission back there. You're not shifting right. This is a standard \u00abH\u00bb.No.You're joking.Fasten your seat belts. I am taking you for the ride of your life. I'm gonna show you what this car can really do. Are you ready ?Hang on.Here we go.This has pedals like a race car. They're really close together. So it's probably easier for a woman to drive, because they have little feet. Except me. I wear a size nine.You know your foot's as big as your arm from your elbow to your wrist ?Did you know that ?It's a little bit of trivia.Can't take less than a hundred dollars.For an hour.I never joke about money.Well, no. But it's got potential.Ah. You're here.Yeah, I'm gonna grab a cab with my twenty bucks.Yeah. My office. Yeah.See you.No, I like the bus. Edward walks to the bench on which Vivian is sitting.Yeah.You got it. She gets off the bench and laughs.What is your name ?Edward. That's my favorite name in the whole world !I tell you what, this is fate, Edward. That's what this is.Why ?Ah.Wow !Oh, honey. You know what's happened ? I've got a runner in my pantyhose.I'm not wearing pantyhose.Well, color me happy ! There's a sofa in here for two.Sorry, I couldn't help it.The penthouse. Mmmm !Oh.You kidding me ? I come here all the time. As a matter of fact, they do rent this room by the hour.Why don't you go out there ?You are ?So how come you rented the penthouse ?Well, now that you have me here, what are you going to do with me ?No ?Well, do you plan everything ?Yeah. Me too. She sits down on an armchair.I'm actually... No, I'm not a planner. I wouldn't say I was a planner. I would say I was, hum, a kind of \u00abfly by the seat of my pants\u00bb girl. You know, moment to moment. That's me. That's... Yeah.Mm-hmm. You know, you could pay me. That's one way to maybe break the ice.Cash works for me, yeah.Well, that's one I haven't been on before.All right. Here we go. Pick one. I got red, I got green, I got yellow. I'm out of purple, but I do have one gold circle coin left. The condom of champions. The one and only. Nothing is getting through this sucker. What d'you say ? Hmm ?I'm a safety girl.All right, let's get one of these on you.Talk. Yeah... uh... okay. Edward, are you in town on, uh, business or pleasure ?Business, you think.Well... let me guess.That would make you... a lawyer.Mm-hmm.You've got that, um... sharp, useless look about you.I've known a lot of everybody.What is that ?Oh ! Well. Might as well make myself useful. Take a load off.Hi.Where would we like it ?Excuse me !What are you looking at ?What is he looking at ?A tip. Wow. I missed that one. Oh. Stupid.You mind if I take my boots off ?So, do you have a wife ? Girlfriend ?Where are they ? Shopping together ?Why ?Oh, groovy. She takes a strawberry and eats it. Edward closes the bowl and brings it back on the bar. He sits down on a stool.Pretty good. Don't you drink ?Listen, I... I appreciate this whole seduction scene you've got going, but let me give you a tip : I'm a sure thing, okay ? So, I'm on an hourly rate. Could we just move it along ?Great, let's get started.Stay here ?Three hundred dollars.Are you sure you want me to stay for the entire night ? I mean, I could just pop you good and be on my way.Why ? Is it your birthday or something ?I mean, I have been the party at a couple of birthdays.So what do you want me to do ?I'll be out in just a minute. That champagne kind of got to me.Uh... I said I'd be out in just a minute.Nothing.I don't do drugs, all right ? I... I stopped doing drugs when I was fourteen.Yeah ? So ? I had all those strawberry seeds. And you shouldn't neglect your gums.Thank you.Are you gonna watch ?Thank you.Yeah, well, you're lucky. Most of them shock the hell out of me.You're watching.I have a little carpet picnic here. Are you sure you don't want a drink ?What do you want ?Everything. But I don't kiss on the mouth.Hi.Red.Y...You didn't wake me. I can see you're really busy. I'm gonna be out of here in just a minute.Thanks.Yeah, too good.Yeah. Did you sleep ?You don't sleep, you don't do drugs, you don't drink, you hardly eat. What do you do, Edward ? Because I know you're not a lawyer.Oh.So what do you do ?What kind of companies ?If they have problems, you must get them for a bargain, huh ?A billion dollars ?Wow. You must be really smart, huh ?I only got through the eleventh grade. How far did you go in school ?Your folks must be really proud, huh ?So you don't actually have a billion dollars, huh ?And you don't make anything.And you don't build anything.So what do you do with the companies once you buy them ?Here, let me do that.You sell them ?So it's sort of like, um, stealing cars and selling them for the parts, right ?Well, I screwed the debate team in high school.I had a grandpa ! He was nice to me. He liked ties on Sundays. Mind if I, um, take a swim in your tub before I go ?If you want to impress me...Oh-oh-oh...Got to be too flirty, Mama...I just want your extra time and your... She makes loud kisses with her mouth.Kiss...Uh-uh, you can't be too flirty, mama.I know how to undress me Mm-hmm...Mm-hmm You just leave it. All up to me.Don't you just love Prince ?Don't you knock ?What do you want ?Really ?Look, I'd love to be your \u00abbeck and call girl\u00bb, but, uh, you're a rich, good-looking guy. You could get a million girls free.If you're talking twenty-four hours a day, it's gonna cost you.Six full nights, days too. Four thousand.You want days too.Three thousand.Holy shit !Yes.Yes !You really should think about traveler's checks.Like what ?Boring.Can I call you Eddie ?I would've stayed for two thousands.Baby, I'm gonna treat you so nice, you're never gonna wanna let me go.But I'm here now.Three thousand dollars !Oof !I called and called. Where were you last night ?Oh, man. Are you ready for this ? The guy ? The Lotus ? I am in his hotel room in Beverly Hills. The penthouse. His bathroom is bigger than the Blue Banana !Kit, he wants me to stay the whole week. And you know what he's gonna give me ?I swear to God. And extra money to buy clothes.No.He's good-looking ! KIT Well, what's wrong with him ?Nothing.Well, he gave me three hundred for last night. And, Kit ?I'm gonna leave some at the front desk for you. I want you to pick it up.Now, one more thing. Where do I go for the clothes ? Good stuff, on him.Hi.Yeah, I'm leaving this here for Kit De Luca. She's gonna pick it up.Don't open that.Well, I'm just checking things out.No. Well, yeah. Uh... something... conservative.You got nice stuff.How much is this ?Well, I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was. The saleswoman # 1 turns toward her colleague.Look, I got money to spend in here.I'm going to my room.Oh. I forgot that cardboard thing. I'm on the top floor.I'm with a friend.Edward.Edward... Edward, uh...He knows me.That's it. Edward Lewis ! Thanks, Dennis.What is with everybody today ?I'm coming. I'm coming.Vivian.Yes.Niece ?No, that's not all. That's what I was trying to do. I tried to go... get a dress on Rodeo Drive today, and the women wouldn't help me. And I have all this money now and no dress !Not that I expect you to help me, but I have all of this, okay ? I have to buy a dress for dinner tonight. And nobody will help me.Oh, man, if you're calling the cops. Yeah, call the cops. That's great. Tell 'em I said hi.Yeah, hi. Barney said you'd be nice to me. They both laugh.We're gonna have dinner.Oh !Mm-hmm.Yeah. How'd you know that ?Bridg, he's not really my uncle.Barney !Sorry, mister.I got a dress !Oh, no, I didn't want to get it messed up ! Listen, I got shoes too. You wanna see ?Okay, well, listen. I didn't mean to interrupt you, but Bridget was really great... and I just wanted to say thanks. You're cool.Hello ?Then why are you calling me ?I got a dress. A cocktail one.Where are you taking me, anyway ?All right. I'll meet you in the lobby, but only 'cause you're paying me to.Hello ?Then stop calling me.Sick.Barney !Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Uh... I've got a little problem.I definitely have the salad fork. The rest of the silverware is a little confusing.You're late.You're forgiven.Hi. I'm really glad to meet you.Excuse me.I'm going to the ladies' room.Okay. Excuse me.Yeah.Please do so. Thank you.Where's the salad ?That's the fork I knew.Who ordered this ?Slippery little suckers.I'm sorry too.He seems like a nice man.I just mean it's sweet the way he's crazy about his grandson.It's ketchup.Haven't they ever seen ketchup before ?Edward, you said you never come out here.Didn't say much in the car on the way home. You thinking about dinner ? I was a maniac.I mean, the business was good, I think. You know ?He's in trouble. You want his company. He doesn't want to let it go.The problem is, I think you liked Mr. Morse.It's making you nervous ? What if I just leaned back a little bit like this ?Would you... Would you rescue me if I fell ?It's really high.Look, no hands, no hands ! Okay, all right. I'm sorry.I know. Kit's always saying to me, \u00abDon't get emotional when you turn tricks\u00bb. That's why no kissing. It's too personal.It's like what you're saying : You stay numb, you don't get involved. When I'm with a guy, I'm like a robot. I just do it.I mean... except with you.I was sorry to hear about your dad. When did he die ?Do you miss him ?Do you want to talk about this ?Well, I tell you what, 'cause I got an idea.Let's watch old movies all night. We'll just veg out in front of the TV.Yeah. Be still like vegetables. Lay like broccoli.Where are you going ?Hi, uh, I'm in the penthouse. The guy that was here, Mr. Lewis, have you seen him down there anywhere ?I didn't know you played.I was getting lonely upstairs all by myself. Edward turns around.People always do what you tell them to do ?I guess so.Oh ! More shopping.Wasn't as much fun as I thought it was gonna be.They were mean to me.People are looking at me.The stores are not nice to people. I don't like it.All right.Okay.Edward would love that tie.He would go crazy about this tie.No, thank you.Hi.Do you remember me ?I was in here yesterday. You wouldn't wait on me.You work on commission, right ?Big mistake. Big. Huge ! I have to go shopping now.Wait... Thank you.How was your day, dear ? Edward stops and looks at her.I got it for you.I would've been angry at the ten thousands dollars.What'd the shrink say ?Well, so you got even. That must've made you happy.Did I mention my leg is 44 inches from hip to toe, so, basically, we're talking about 88 inches of therapy......wrapped around you for the bargain price of...Yeah.What if someone recognizes me ?You did.Well, I'm not trying to land him. I'm just using him for sex.Well done. Whoo, whoo, whoo !Tell me again why we're here.Business mingling ?Real genuine guy. Who is he ?You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.Are these people your friends ?Well, no wonder.No wonder why you came looking for me.Thank you.David.I'm okay.It's new.Well, Edward's waiting for me. I don't want to...Okay, I'll... Just for a second, though.I didn't know you were playing today.Yeah, I'm having a great time.What ?Yeah, sure. Why not ?I'm fine.Asshole ! There's a word.You know what ? Just tell me one thing : Why did you make me get all dressed up ?No, what I mean is, if you were gonna tell everybody I'm a hooker, - why didn't you just let me wear my own clothes, okay ?I mean, in my own clothes, when someone like that guy Stuckey comes up to me, I can handle it, I'm prepared.What are you, my pimp now ?You know, you think you can pass me around to your friends ? I'm not some little toy !Look, you don't own me. I decide, okay ? I say who. I say when. I... I say who...I'm sorry I ever met you. She walks away into the bathroomI'm sorry I ever got into your stupid car !I've never had anyone make me feel as cheap as you did today.I want my money. I want to get out of here.Come on !Why ?We were just talking.You hurt me.Don't do it again.First guy I ever loved was a total nothing. Second was worse. My mom called me a bum magnet. If there was a bum within a fifty-mile radius, I was completely attracted to him. That's how I ended up here. I followed bum number three. Slowly, the camera moves closer to them.So here I was : no money, no friends, no bum.I worked at a couple fast food places, parked cars at wrestling. And I couldn't make the rent. I was too ashamed to go home. That's when I met Kit. She was a hooker and made it sound so great. So one day I did it.I cried the whole time. But then I got some regulars and, you know... It's not like anybody plans this. It's not your childhood dream.People put you down enough, you start to believe it.The bad stuff is easier to believe. You ever notice that ?Do I look okay ?Mmm ?Well, nothing else is gonna fit into this dress. I'll tell you that.Oh !They really let you borrow this from the jewelry store ?If you were gonna buy this, how much would it cost ?A quarter of a million dollars ?So, where are we going ?If I forget to tell you later, I had a really good time tonight.I've never been on a plane before.We're late.Okay.Hey, come here. You gotta look at this.If you're afraid of heights, why do you get seats up here ?Oh !So, you said this is in Italian.So how am I gonna know what they're singing. These are broken.Mine are broken.Oh.There's a band !Mmm.Oh, it was so good, I almost peed in my pants.Why don't you not go to work tomorrow. Take the day off.Yeah.I'm starving. There's a snap dog vendor over there. Do you have any money ?Well, I'm gonna give, um... you'll buy a snap dog. We'll cop a squat under a tree somewhere.Cop a squat.Um... There's a club up here that I'd like to stop into for a second to see my roommate, if that's okay ?Uh, Darryl, can you just pull up into the back alleyway, please ?I just wanna run in for a minute and see if she's there, so just stay here.I'm hoping they don't spot this limousine as it is.Hey, Rachel, have you seen Kit ?Hi, Pops. Thanks. Have you seen Kit ?Here's my number where I'm gonna be for the rest of the week. Have her call me or come by, okay ?Thanks.What's going on out here ?Let's just leave.He's a drug dealer. It has to do with Kit. Let's just go, Edward.He sleeps.I love you.Well, you've been pretty tough to take.You would ?What else ? You gonna leave some money by the bed when you pass through town ?How would it be ?That's just geography.I don't know. When I was a little girl, my mama used to lock me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. And I would... I would pretend I was a princess... trapped in a tower by a wicked queen....on a white horse with these colors flying would come charging up and draw his sword. And I would wave. And he would climb up the tower and rescue me.But never in all the time... that I had this dream did the knight say to me, \u00abCome on, baby, I'll put you up in a great condo\u00bb.I know. It's a really good offer for a girl like me.You just did.Listen, I've been calling you.You were supposed to come by Tuesday. I left the money at the desk.Well, if you picked up the money, you wouldn't have to hide.Well, thanks, but it's easy to clean up when you got money.Tomorrow.Yeah. Edward asked me if I wanted to see him again. But I think... I think definitely no. I mean, it's just another week, right ?Yeah.What ?Oh, no, you don't !No. Kit, please. Stop it.Kit !Uh, yeah, yeah... I did.I did. It was nice.Look, I'm not stupid, okay ? I'm... I'm not in love with him. I just... I like him.Yeah.Who's gonna break my heart, right ?When does it happen, Kit ? When does it really happen ? Who does it really work out for ? Did it work out for Skinny Marie or Rachel ? No !I just wanna know who it works out for. You give me one example of somebody that we know that it happened for.Yeah, one person that it worked out for.Yeah. I'd like to know.Edward's not here. I thought he was with you.No.No, thank you.Uh, Edward will be back soon. Any minute, he'll be home.Hey, get off me !Ow !Get off me ! Ow ! Get off me !Get off me ! Get off me !Wham ! And it feels like your eye is gonna explode. What do they do ? Do they pull you aside in high school and show you how to do this ?Is that... Ow ! Even the light touch of the napkin seems to hurt her.I heard about what you did with Morse.It was good.I think this is okay.I gotta get going.Edward, there'll always be some guy, even some friend of yours, thinking he can treat me like Stuckey, thinking that it's allowed. What are you gonna do ? You gonna beat up everybody ?Look, you made me a really nice offer. And a few months ago, no problem. But now everything is different, and you've changed that. And you can't change back. I want more.I want the fairy tale.You're welcome. She puts the money in the pocket of her jacket. He is holding a business card in his hand.I had a good time.No, I got it.Thanks.I can't.I think you have a lot of special gifts.Hi, Barney.I wanted to say good-bye.Come on, Barney. You and me live in the real world... most of the time.I'm gonna call a cab.Stay cool.I'll wear a sweater.Get a job. Finish high school. I got things I can do. I used to make pretty good grades in high school.Sure you won't come with me ?Come here.It's part of the Edward Lewis scholarship fund. We think you got a lot of potential, Kit De Luca.Oh, yeah. Don't let anybody tell you different, okay ?Take care of you.An hour.Whoa.

Vivian doesn't smile back at her, and looks even a bit angry.Carlos, you know my roommate, Vivian. This is Angel. That's the Dude.Carlos sold me some great shit. We just had this party. I was the hostess.I needed a little pick-me-up.Carlos !That was from way before.That's a very sweet offer, Carlos, but not now.Come on, Viv. Come downstairs.You were unavailable for consultation.Hey, let's go. Snack ! Snack ! She has reached the bar and starts picking bits of food in plates on the counter.Besides, it's my apartment.Look, you came here. I gave you some money. I gave you a place to stay......and some valuable vocational advice. He was on my case. I had to give him something.So don't irritate me.I know. Skinny Marie. But... she was a... a flake. She was a crack head. Dominic was trying to straighten her out for months.Get out of where ? Where the fuck you wanna go ?Hey, yo, Rachel.Yeah. You see the stars on the sidewalk, babe ? She is mentioning the stars of the Walk of Fame, embedded in the sidewalk of the boulevard.Well, Vivian and me, we work Bob Hope, we work the Ritz Brothers, we work Fred Astaire, we work all the way down to Ella Fitzgerald. This is our turf. We got seniority. You better get off our corner.Yeah. Well, I'm old, so go rest up by Monty Hall or Esther Wilson.Esther Williams ! Where you belong !Am I really a grouch ?Well, just 'cause I'm hungry. I'm gonna go get something to eat.Hey, yo, baby !Dream on !Yeah, well... maybe we should get a pimp, you know. Carlos really digs you.You're right. We say who, we say when, we say how much.No ! I love this look. It's very glamorous. Glamour choice.Oh, yo, oh, yo. Catch this !No, that's rent. You should go for him. You look hot tonight. Don't take less than a hundred. Call me when you're through. Take care of you.Hello ?Ma ?Oh. Hi. I had to party. Where are you ?Do I have to hear this ?Bullshit !Oh, man ! I am bummed. I gave that guy to you !Three thousand. Really ? Is he twisted ?Did he give you the money yet ?That's what's wrong with him.Reg... Bev... Wil.In Beverly Hills ? VIVIAN Yeah.Rodeo Drive, baby.Let me talk to her. Let me... Let me just talk to her.Yo, Viv, babe. Would you come down here ? The sphincter police won't let me through. Okay.She's on her way.Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch.Yeah, I know. They told me at the Banana you were looking for me.I was hiding out from Carlos.Hey, I was busy. I had a life, you know. Nino got beat up. We had to visit him in the hospital. Rachel got arrested. It was a mess. Anyway, I got the money.Thank you very much for saving my ass. Now Carlos can get off of it.You know, he was talking about you last night. He would bust something if he saw you in this outfit.I was afraid to hug you up there. I might wrinkle you !You look really good.No, something with shade.You clean up real nice. You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard looking like you do, not that you ever did.Yeah. So, when does he leave ?You get to keep the clothes ?\u00abDefinitely no\u00bb.Oh, no.I know this weepy look on your face.You fell in love with him.You've fallen in love with him ?Did you kiss him ? On the mouth ?You kissed him on the mouth ?You fall in love with him, and you kiss him on the mouth. Did I not teach you anything ?You like him ?You definitely like him. Well, he's not a bum. He's a rich, classy guy.Oh, no. Come on. You don't know that. Hey, he asked you, right ? Maybe you guys could, like, um, you know, get a house together. Like, buy some diamonds and a horse. I don't know.Anyway, it could work. It happens.Those were very specific cases of crackheads.Name someone ?You want me to give you a name or something.Oh, God, the pressure of a name.Cinder-fucking-rella.We look so dopey.San Francisco's not that great, you know.It's bad climate. It's foggy. It's unpredictable.What are you gonna do there ?Yeah, I could see that about you. I could see that.And leave all this ? Not in a million.Whoa. Whoa. What is this ?You do ? You think I got potential ?Okay.No, I can't, I can't. It's your favorite.What time's your bus ?Yeah, well, I gotta split, 'cause good-byes make me crazy. So, take care of you.I'm gonna have to charge you a little more rent than Vivian... because I've got this beauty course I'm looking into. I'm not gonna be there that much, you know ?'Cause you can't... You just can't turn tricks forever. You gotta have a goal.
