How do you find someone special?I know. I know. \"You sing your heart out.\" That's how mum found dad in the first placeWith them it was love at first song.But with me everything was a different, right from the moment I was bornFirst rule of survival: get yourself laid before winter.Apparently I only just made it.Afterwards Mum went off to the sea to keep warm. Dad stayed home like dad's do, incubating.Tell me what it is about the cold and the dark. Soon as the sun goes away, everyone gets religiousCaruso's the leader because he's so incredibly old. Some say more than 40, but you know how penguins exaggerate.My dad was never that devout. Often his mind was on other stuff.I guess he was wrong about a lot of things.Ow! Freezy, Fuh-Fuh-Freeezy! All Freezy!So What happens now, Dad?Is she coming soon?Tell me again what she's likeSorry. When I get happy my feet get happy too.But Why Dad?Gee I'm hungryWhat's fish look like.Did she get one. Did she bring one back.Can I see it?I got one! I got a mum everyone. I got a MUM!!After that, with food being so scarce everyone was busy busy busy. Mom and dad were working so hard I didn't see much of them. Besides I had school to go to.Swimming? Catching Food?That doesn't make any sense.Mine is more sort of a...Bim bam-a-loolah a bim bam bomYou like it?It's not?Oh, La la la la laLa la la la la la la la!!But that's what I'm doing,Whats funny?

Plus I was beginning to moultI couldn't face the class in this mood So I just kept going.Looking for what? I don't know? A different type of penguin?And that's exactly what I found.Not the nicest place in the world but at least you could do what you liked here.Me? Oh, nothing. What are you doing?Lunch?...There's food? Here?But ...but. I'm a penguin.I don't have juicy bits! Look... all bone and feather! Feel for yourself.Wait! WAIT!Every seen anything like this?Hey! What's that on your leg?How...?Unbelievable.You don't sayAt least those aliens didn't eat you.So - You think I could appeal to your better nature?Compared with that, school almost seemed like funMost days I hid at the back, dreaming about the world beyondTime passed. We all grew upBut right up to graduation I never did find my heartsongCaruso. He couldn't help himself.Dad, Ma, can I go with the othersDad? I'll learn to sing later. I'll find my voice out there.

You get one?Here, have it.I want you to have it.Hey. The fish is for Ella Take it. Really.

I didn't do anything.Well...I just kind of go ...like this...and then this...Or how about ...Wow, there are so many of you!The shortage has affected you too?!Why funny? That's terribleSo why aren't you guys collecting them....you think I could get some of it?You really think so?So for a while I forgot about finding a song altogether....We were a team...there was so much to do, so much to see....stuff down there beyond my wildest imagining.Oh! There you areGuys! I want to speak to you.But its dead. It can't hurt youBut that's what we have to find out. Don't you see. Things like that could be eating the fish.The who?Why stones? Wait for meI was wondering. Have You ever been abducted by Aliens?...you see I met a Skua once, with something like that on his legs....... and he said he was abducted by Aliens.Looks like they bestowed it very tight.So these Mystic Beings, did you see them?Did they have frontways eyes? No feathers? Fat flabby faces? Did they probe you and stick a pointy thing into you?But I haven't had any answers yet!We don't collect them. All we have to do is , well... We singLa la la la la la la laaaaaaaaaaaaa!!See. That's how I ended up with you guys. And emperor who can't sing isn't an emperor at all.You can?!Tall and tanned and young and lovely The Girl from Ipanema goes walking And when she passes each guy she passes goes `Aaaah'Oh, and I want her so badly How can I tell her I love her? Yes I would give my heart gladlyBut each day when she walks to the sea, She looks straight ahead not at me....\"Hi Ella, what do you think?Ella. Wait!I'm sorry.Don't care? I never stopped thinking about you.I can't sing.But I'll show you something betterSing something to this!Just try it. This once.Okay, that'll work. Just keep it going.This is it Ella! This is the song inside me!I'm just showing them Happy FeetWait. Wait. You think it's my fault that there are no fish?!! Doing Happy Feet can't cause a food shortage.My own opinion? I think living beyond the ice there are creatures we've never met before Aliens. Mystic Beings. Big, flabby......BACK OFF, YA SCREWY-ASS FLIPPERBIRD!This is crazinessYou too pa?!No. Dad. No. What have they done to you. You're talking like Caruso.No. You're nuts. All of you. I'm outa here.Its no use Ella. I can't live with that.Guys. Can Me and Ella be alone for a bitOK. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to talk an alien. I'm going to find what's causing the shortageIts the only way. You're right. Unless we have food theres no future for any of us - you, me the adelies, anyoneGive me a year, just until the next great gathering. If I don't make it back ....at least I triedNow go back. I love you. Go.To find the mystic beings.We'll ask Loveday. He's been there.Just one question! And I want a straight answer! Where do I find the Mystic Beings?No. He's choking! The Talisman's gotten way too tight.Stop. You're hurting him.LOVEDAY, where did you get it?They didn't bestow it on you?If it wasn't bestowed, what happened?And then....?You looked up and...... It just got caught around your neck?Loveday, did you ever meet a Mystic Being? Really?But this thing was made by someone. And if we find them, they could take it off.So where do we Go, LovedayThe forbidden place is over the mountains......In the land of the Elephant Seals!!?...Beyond the land of the Elephant Seals!!?So who's comingHear that?!Excuse me, we need directions...to the Forbidden Shore.We're looking for the Mystic BeingsAliens, the ones who made this.Could they be taking our fish?But If your grandpappys saw them and they survived, maybe they're not so fierce.Come on Loveday, lets goThey don't know. They've never been thereSo we walked ... and walked .. and kept walking. Over the hills and into Blizzard countryWe need to huddle!Form a moving circle! Share the cold, share the warmth!I said a circle!Just keep moving! Toboggan, if you have to!!You think this is it? The Forbidden Shore?Hello?! Is there anyone out there?Hello!!What is it?They must be here somewhere. They wouldn't leave all this stuff lying around.A whale?The ones with teeth!!No!! Stay on the ice pad where its safeLOVEDAY! LOVEDAY!!Aliens?!Stop! Please!.......It's very important!WE...HAVE...TO...TALK!They've stopped!Say Hi to Ella for meOh. One other thing. You guysExcelsi yah!!!HEY! YOU CAN'T DO THAT!HEY YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET AWAY WITH THIS?!! NOT IF I CAN HELP IT YOU SHIT- SQUIRTER ALIEN CREEPS.Too loud.Too loud!The Convergence?I'm trying to talk to the Aliens!On the black iceberg. The ones taking all the fish!They kill whales! That's impossibleSo if I wanted to talk to them, where would I goWhere's that. Do you think the Whale would take me there?When I finally saw one, the Alien was even more hideous than I'd imagined... frontways eyes, no feathers. Big teeth with blood around them. Strange fleshy beak. A meat eaterThe - fish - are - ours. Understand?We can't live without them!Speak Adelie? Skua-talk?Oh no! Not the pointy thing!I woke in darkness. Unable to move. Was I dead? And if I was dead, where was that light coming fromWow. They brought me homeExcuse me, where are we.Oh. So we're dead. RightWhere?Every day after that, it rained fish in the afternoon.Fish on land and fish underwater.Sometime you got a live one but there was nowhere really to chase itAliens everywhere, watching you eat, watching you sleepWhat have you done to my wing! This is not my home! I want to get out of here!After a while, you learn to stop fighting it. Stop protesting, take the knocks....just take what comes and live inside your mindSometimes I thought about dad and mum. Sometimes the Amigos, and others I'd met along the way. But mostly I thought about Ella, wondering who she ended up with. Whether she had enough food to eat. whether she still remembered our song.What? What did I do?You like that? Well how about this.Hi, where is everybody!?I used to live here. When's the Great Gathering?This is all that's left?Ella! Is it you. You haven't changed a bit.Are these all yours?So. You never....But that's fantastic. I've got so much to tell you - to tell everyone. I found out who's been causing the Scarcity!I know who's been taking our fish! I made contact with Aliens! They're coming here. Right behind me. Listen.No, honestly Aliens will be here soon! You have to believe me. We came in a big hollow bird and they landed on the ice and....But its true!!It's so they can find me. That's them now. Listen.You said they didn't exist.No. Do this. Do Happy feet.Come on, everyone! Happy Feet! It's our only chance!FEET!!FEET! FEET!! HAPPY FEET!!That's it! Excellent! \u00a1Riba Riba, penguinos! Shake those hips. Come on, bust a move!!From that day on, No one quite knows how it happened, but the black icebergs began to disappear and the fish became abundant once more.Ella's gave up teaching to look after our chick. We take turns looking after her and going to get the fish.I worry about her, sure. Theres so much big stuff out there it can be kind of frightening.But the way I see it. Theres so much out there we don't understand...,", "clean_line": "feel small like cos world samehow stand crowd special know know sing heart mum dad placewith love song different right moment
