{"Meet-Joe-Black": {"PARRISH": {"raw_line": "What do you think of all this, May?Oh, the President's got better things to do than come to my birthday party.Hi, Allison --Not much more. Big day in the big city. What's on your mind?Allison, I trust you. This is your thing.Hi, honey.Drew's aboard?I hate parties --Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.How did you know?Does Drew tell you everything?You like him, don't you?I don't like to interfere.Good morning, Drew. Thanks for coming out.'Thoughts'? Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.In my sleep.'Yes'.Maybe, who knows? You know how voices are. Let's go.Good morning, Quince.I'm doing great. You ready?How's that, Quince?Not my birthday again?Thank God. Now could we go? Let's get this day started.I am. With you.I know it's none of my business --Do you love Drew?Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?Don't get carried away.Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --Well, I wasn't going to say that --Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.That's for me. I'm talking about you. It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.Oh yes, I am. Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.Well, it worries me. I want you to get swept away. I want you to levitate. I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.Be deliriously happy. Or at least leave yourself open to be.I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without. If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with? I say fall head over heels. Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back. And how do you find him? Forget your head and listen to your heart. I'm not hearing any heart. Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back. Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this. To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try. Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.Aw, you're tough.Stay open. Who knows? Lightning could strike.You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.I know. But I'm the only father you've got.He doesn't care. But thanks anyway.What?Did you just hear something?No no, not you.Nothing. I'm sorry.Nothing.Well, here we are --A-Okay. Got my gloves on, my ears pricked. I'm ready for action.Yer damn right.Sounds good.Do you think I need a haircut?Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time.Good, good. Glad to hear it.I'm sorry, I don't recall --I thought you were buying my company.Well, that's very nice to hear.Me, too.Like a marriage made in heaven?Hi, Jennifer.As close as a deal could be.'Yes' what?I didn't ask any question.Who are you?I don't!What are you talking about?What is this? Who is this fucking guy?I'm sorry, I --Where are you? Are you there?Please. Talk to me --What do you mean?!Know what? Know what, goddammit!Come in.Sure.No. Nothing.What, honey?I know you do, darling.Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart. I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.Tell it to me again.Is somebody waiting outside, Luisa?Please have a look --Show him into the library, tell him I'll be right there.Uh -- I don't know. No - uh - I don't...Hello?Where are you?What is this, a joke, right? Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --I - I - uh --What the hell is this? Who are you?About what?'Take me'...? Where?'The one' to do what?Get what?What the hell are you talking about?I'm sorry --Yes what?What question?The 'question' --...Am I going to die?Am I dreaming this? Are you a dream?You're coming to 'take me'. What is that? Who the hell are you?You are --?...Death.Death!You're not Death. You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.You want me to be your guide --?I do? How long will you be staying?And then --?This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.Excuse me? Could I say something?It just occurred to me --When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.Uh -- sorry -- to have stepped away for so long -- uh -- this is a friend of mine I asked to drop by -- we got to talking and stuff -- uh -- he's going to join us for dinner -- um --Oh, I'm sorry. This is my daughter, Allison, and her husband, Quince, Drew, my number one, works with me...A name?Oh, excuse me. This is -- uh -- this is --Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --Yes.What do you mean?-- Black.He is! Let's sit down --Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --Uh -- he's from out of town --No --You know each other?What?!Uh - will that hold you, Joe?We've got some things to discuss.Cut it out, Susan. You and I've got to talk. Big day tomorrow, everybody. Joe, let's go.Joe, that's the kitchen....I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.Shook me up. I mean that you knew her and everything --So there's nothing between you and Susan?I wish you had said something to me about staying here --No, I'm okay with this - uh - I think. So --Bathroom...tub...towels, sauna --Thank you. Would you like the man's name?If there is anything else, don't hesitate --How long have I got?When you go, I go....I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.No --Closer than that.Well, thank you for letting me know.And - uh - I guess, 'goodnight'.No. Thanks, Luisa.Luisa --Good morning.How are you? How're you feeling?Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy. This is the left- field thing of all time. What do I do? What do I tell my family?What about my family? This 'adven- ture' involved only me, right?And I won't tell anyone who you are.It is a deal?You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say. It's a truth exchanged between two people.Yes?Shake hands.You know, I got to thinking last night -- with you here, and seem- ingly occupied, how's your work going - uh - elsewhere?What do you mean?I guess so.Of course.Joe --?How about giving a guy a break?There's one to every rule.-- I don't deserve this. I'm still young, this is not my time --I'm not everybody.I want to live.What's it like?What's it like where I'm going?Yes.Good morning, Jaime.I'm sorry, not today, Jaime.-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.Jennifer.Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.-- This is Joe Black, a personal associate of mine - uh - he'll be joining us today. I know it's -- uh -- unusual, and my apologies -- and Drew -- uh -- carry on.Would you like to sit down, Joe?Thank you, Drew.Sorry. I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.I am now.Shall we adjourn?Well said, Eddie. Mr. Black, shall we?-- What's the deal here? Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?...I'd like to be alone for a while.Yes, I am. There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor. Why don't you go down and read some magazines?Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something. I know I'll be seeing you.Now I'd like to be alone.Here -- this will hold you for a while.Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.It's all yours.Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro. A little Coleman's mustard.Glad you like it. My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches. Joan -- that was my wife --Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken. She knew stuff like that.Why didn't you stop me?I thought you'd heard a trillion times --She had on this little blue suit -- with a little white collar that had little red piping on it --No.Sit down, Drew.Joe and I have no secrets from each other.Why?Joe, cut it out. And you too, Drew.Well now it's undone, okay? Forget Bontecou! Scrub him! I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. I'm not going for it.Dinner? Absolutely.I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be. A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it. And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either! You! Drew! I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.Thank you, Quince.Next week?No, anything is possible. It's up to Joe.Who?Conflict, honey. Korean Conflict.Of course.I like it. I like it. I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew. Forgive me. I want you to know I value your advice.You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money. Joe is just... around.Please. Don't worry about him. And above all, don't antagonize him.-- I - uh - want to thank you all for coming - uh - my family --Anyway -- I remember when you were little girls --And now you're all grown up -- and I'm - uh - um --Will it?...There is so much I would like to say -- but I can't -- So I better sit down. Carry on, everybody.No.Please, Drew.Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.Why did you go to the hospital?You were just curious?About Susan?What way would you put it?How about you telling me? When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer. That's what I'm used to. Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.That was wonderful.Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?What is the nature of your interest in Joe?I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for. Drew's a good man. I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --Nothing.Then what is it?What is this?Who's Annie?I don't like cake.Oh, the goddam party --No thank you, Quince. I'm sorry, honey. I'm no good at this. Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?Yeah, I give a shit.This one.What is there to say? They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.What are their feelings?Over my dead body.I don't care.Whose?I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.I think it's time you went home, Drew.Hello. Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?Okay. Goodnight.Good morning, Jennifer.What?Good morning.I don't think so. Do you?That's it?The answer is no, quick enough for you?I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either. What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal. No, thank you.Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?Are you running this Board or am I?Doesn't need to. Today, tomorrow, a week from now -- 'a week from now', who can think about a week from now -- the answer is going to be the same -- a loud, unmistakable, all-inclusive, airtight -- 'No'.I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.In English, please.Thank you for allowing me to save face, Drew.Joe?Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings\" shit.Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.That's okay.Just a manner of speaking.What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over. We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?Never mind. I'm tired. I'm going to take a nap.Then I can't help you.I couldn't sleep.No, I'll come downWell, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.I'm her father!Well, you goddam well should. You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.Yes, and stop repeating everything I sai, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what. You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --What do you want?You're violating the laws of the universe.Any universe that exists or ever existed. You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are. And you're all fucked up.And I don't give a shit.Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.Hello, honey.Joe?I don't know.I don't understand.This is crazy --You don't know anything about Joe --Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.I don't know, I can't say --In this case, I can't. I - uh -- I just can't help you. I only would tell you -- that with Joe, you are on very, very dangerous ground.I don't care if you love him! I'm telling you he's no good for you!Yes?What are you saying, that it's time to go?Yeah.Excuse me.Eddie?Fine, fine. Big doing up here. Why are you still down here?Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over. Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory.It's starting to grow on me. But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?Do they, m'dear?You are amazing. Why, oh why, Allison, are you doing all this?Yeah? And what about my enemies?I haven't been the father to you that --I wasn't going to say --Hey, there's lots to come. A little excess -- like you love.You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.It's okay, Quince. I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that. Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.Sure.Yes, I believe I do.No, I'm out of business, right, Quince? However I do have some unfinished business -- with Drew. Get him out here. Get him on the chopper and get him out here to- night. I want to tell this guy how I feel about him face-to-face.All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.Quince, I've got confidence in you.Thanks.What the hell do you care?You 'want to know', I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's galloping into it. And the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates. And, oh yes, I almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with Death.Say again?You're what?You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry? Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you. It's not love --Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging. It's missing everything that matters.Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them. And above all, not hurting the object of your love.Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.Well, they're mine now.With you?! Who is 'you'? Did you tell her who you are?Does she know where she's going?I don't expect you to.I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.Why did you come in here and tell me, Joe? You are the Biggest Shot of all, you don't have to ask my permission, but that's what you're doing. You know why? Because you've somewhere, somehow, developed into a good guy, and you know this is all wrong... I don't know what you're going to do -- how can this be love? She doesn't know who you are. Why don't you tell her? Try it out on her? See what happens. Reveal everything there is to know about yourself and let the chips fall where they may.Thank you.Come in.How are we on time?Get him in here.No, he's at the office.I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time. As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you -- -- or not. Either way, thanks.Shut up and sit down.The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.Joe, don't do this --It's not necessary, Joe. Drew's going to step aside --I told you to shut up.He is ---- An IRS man.The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for. The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity. I agreed to cooperate.Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew. He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence. Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --An offense --No lawyers, Drew. We're going to offer you a deal.You get not to go to jail.Proof? We've got plenty of proof.Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for. I just wanted to set the record straight.I thought I was going to sneak away tonight...I'm having a helluva time.I'm sorry.Yes, but --I want you to know how much I love you. That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something. I don't want you to ever worry about me. If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right. -- And I have no regrets.That's why it's okay.It's a good feeling, isn't it?I'm still here. Would you like to dance with me, Susan?If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.What was that?You go ahead, honey, I'm going to catch my breath.Thank you.I guess you have your reasons.Now that we have a moment, would you mind if I expressed my gratitude for what you did for Susan?Don't blow smoke up my ass, you'll ruin my autopsy.That's life. What can I tell you?I'm getting a little dizzy, I can feel my heart pumping --", "clean_line": "think oh president got better things come birthday party hi allison big day big city mind allison trust

very nice to see you again.Susan. Allison. Quince. Drew. Bill... Thank you.Thank you.'Threw' you? Where?I didn't know her. The body I took knew her. The man she met in the coffee shop this morning. I - uh - took him.No.It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?What a good idea.No.I won't.You're putting me on the spot, Bill.That's the best I can do. ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.Your doctor? Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta? Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain? Were they any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart of suffocating in an avalanche on a skin vacation in Gstaad?I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.Not at all.Good night to you, Bill.Hello. I'm Joe Black. Nice to meet you.What are you eating.'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'. You like it?Yes, I am. I thoroughly enjoyed this - uh - peanut butter. And I thoroughly enjoyed meeting you.I'm lost.I'm sorry.'Big'?I am Joe.That is not my intention.Peanut butter.I haven't.Do you love Drew?When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.I'm sorry. Do you live here?I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.I don't have any....I didn't mean to offend you at dinner. I'm not quite at home some- times with people. I get busy doing - uh - what I do, and I don't seem to have developed --I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time. Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.Susan?Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?Goodnight to you, Susan.Yes?Thank you.Good morning, Bill.'Feeling'? I feel fine. How do you feel?Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill. You'll ruin the good start we had last night. I felt as if I were being treated like a person. 'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.And what?Sounds fair enough.A 'deal'?Bill --You've got a deal.When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.So you've grasped the idea. Con- gratulations. Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.Yes, Bill.Make an exception?Not this.That's what everybody says.That's what everybody says.I understand.What do you mean?Can you keep a secret?So can I.No.I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.Thank you.Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?Why yes, thank you.Cold.Yes.'Death and Taxes'?\"Death and Taxes\"?What an odd pairing.Of whom?Then why did you bring it up?Those cookies were excellent.I don't understand.Are you sad, Bill?You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?Of course.Oh. Okay.It can't buy happiness?No thank you, Bill. I can manage.How nice you look. Is that your uniform?Oh goodness, no.I came to see you.Very well, I'll watch.Whatever you do.And I'll be a visitor.I don't mind --No obeah, sister. No duppy, no jumbie. Evera ting gon' be irey.Obeah evil. I not evil.I from dat nex' place.No, no. I on holiday.I nuttin' to do wi' dat.Doctor lady make it irey.Can't, sistah.Not time yet.Can't feel wi' de way tings gotta be, Easter.Close your eyes, Easter.She's in a great deal of pain.Some.Thank you. I'm so very glad to be here.Well, I could come again some other time.Not now.Be sorry for nothing.Good-bye, Susan.Are you going to eat your lunchExcellent. What is it?Truly - uh - splendid.Uh-huh.And more.Well...I don't know.This part I'm interested in.Yes.Perhaps a merger is a way to bring Bill's company into the 21st cen- tury. And perhaps it isn't. And perhaps cheating on your French Philosophers exam at The Groton School was an expedient way to get your diploma, and perhaps it wasn't. Be that as it may, Drew, a question can often be argued both ways.Absolutely.Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?Okay.Easy, Bill. You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.That's very gracious of you, Quince.I wanted to apologize, Susan --Well, now I am sorry. For intruding on you this afternoon.I appreciate you --I mean I appreciate that.You do? Well, thank you very much.No.I would prefer some peanut butter.Toast? No...just the butter.I don't know.Yes...Yes...I've found that it does.I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.Has her pain abated?I'm sorry to hear that.But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.Perhaps you could remind me.Susan is a wonderful doctor.I don't know.I guess...I wouldn't put it that way.You tell me, Bill.Are you going to fire me, Bill?I don't like the way Drew spoken to you. But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.Why?No, I'm not.No.No.Thank you, I appreciate that.To bed.Yes. I'm tired.Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one.And you're a nice man, Quince.You're welcome.No, I don't --You first.Almost.What an angry fellow.Please. We don't need to talk about Drew.I love your smell.Thank you.-- Could you?Why, yes. Thank you.You're welcome.Yes?Well...I'm -- uh, Joe. And you're Susan. And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --Faster. And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever.Hello, Bill.Um -- not right now.Goodnight.Who I am, and my relationship to Bill, will be divulged in our own good time.I'm sorry, Bill --What's okay?'Fish'?I'm not hungry.I am.How beautiful.He's taking a nap.Yes, he's tired. I believe so....No.Thank you.I loved it.Yes!Nowhere? I'm...here.Oh, I hope a long, long time.What do we do now?Hello, Bill.I'm sorry to hear that.Yes, I saw you see me.I'll be the judge of that.With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.'Spooning'?I picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to - how shall I say - instruct. You've lived a first-rate life. And I find it eminently usable.I'm only following the Parrish bywords. Looking for that 'ounce of excitement', that 'whisper of a thrill' -- What there is no sense living your life without. You know what I mean, Bill.This universe?I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me. So watch it...Bill.I told you, 'watch it'.Dr. Parrish.Oh.Don' be facety, woman.No, I come to see Doctor.Nuthin'.Yes.Mine, too.Yah.I am.She knows how she feel.Don' need you okayin'.Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.Can do no right by people. Come to take, you wan' to stay, leave you stay, you wan' to go. Rahtid!But I not lonely here. Somebody want me here.Got enough nice pictured, Easter.Why are you giving me money?I am who I am. I cannot change.That's impossible. You're wasting your money. I couldn't change even if I wanted to.Uh ---- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.You are?Good. Tomorrow, after the party.No, thank you.Do I? I'm a little confused.Love.You love Allison, don't you?How did you meet?But she loves you?'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?What do you mean 'free'?Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.Go to Bill Parrish and tell him everything. He'll forgive you.Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.-- Getting to.No.I love you in an evening gown.Yes. Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.Well -- I --I can tell you the when part. Tonight.No worse than it gets for me. I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.We know so little about each other --But there's so much to tell you --Will it?What will we do?'Love will find out the way'?I believe that, don't you?Excuse me --Tell Drew that Bill acknowledges that this was a contest and he's lost. The race is to the swift, but could Drew summon a modicum of understanding and allow Bill to save face. Tell him Bill wants it understood in the business community he has merely moved upstairs in his own company, and the executive continuity is unbroken. Tonight's the night to do it. He'll introduce Drew to his press friends as well as some of his close acquaintances from Washington and Drew can tell them that everything's sailing along just fine.Not at all.I was just asking, Bill.-- And I'm in love with your daughter.I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.I think you heard me, Bill.I'm sorry, Bill --I love her, Bill. She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.Then what is it?Which is what?So that's what love is?Those were my words, Bill.Susan wants to come. She says she's in love with me.No.I don't like what you're saying.Are you threatening me?Are you telling me I can't be part of it?There is something I do want to tell you --Did I say that?The 'coffee shop' --I - uh --Don't you know, that's what I want more than anything.May I kiss you?I'm still here.I love you now, I'll love you always --Susan --Thank you for loving me....We should think about getting started, Bill.Okay.You're the poison, Drew. You've operated behind-the-scenes to suborn the trust of a man who has stamped you with his imprimatur of class and elegance and stature. I've seen all kinds and degrees of deception in my time, but Bill Parrish has been on the receiving end of machinations so Machiavellian that it has rarely been my experience to encounter. And yet he has combatted them stoically, and selflessly, without revealing my identity. Had he violated the vow of secrecy he took, his task would have been far easier, he could have turned defeat into victory, but he is too honorable a man to have done that. And now I must release him from that vow. Because of me, he has lost his work, his company, his reputation -- and now he's going to tell you who I am.-- And now you're going to pee some more.It's time to put this person where he belongs.I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --I'll take it from here -- I am --Yes, I am. IRS man.And we're very grateful.Undisclosed conflict of interest --An indictable offense.And he's talking through his lips.My pleasure. This is an IRS Agent's dream. I'll be promoted to Chief of Section off of this.'Death and Taxes'.Do you have any peanut butter?Thank you, anyway.Happy Birthday, Bill.Not exactly.Yes.I wouldn't worry about it, Bill. These things have a way of working out.Yes.Not a man like you.-- You bet.I don't know -- y'know, I don't know -- it's all blurred up and hazy. And would y'know what I mean if I said I don't think it's worth figuring out?Well, I don't know what else to say.
