You betcha, Iris. Yah-I think yous boys'll find that things are different here in Mount Rose......Today's \"To Do\" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the \"Physical Fitness\" number --Y'betcha, Iris. We still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme.Oh, my! Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! I just thought of the theme.Last year? It was, \"Buy American.\"\"U.S.A. is A-okay.\"\"Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!\" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's...maybe a gift from God or somethin'.Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year...drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.But the show must go on. I gotta get a hold of Ted and ask him if we can use that barn light as a spot again. So you watch the Jell-o salad, okay?Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.We're not in the showroom, Dear.Lester?\"Impartial?\" Outside this house I'm Gladys Leeman, President, Civil Servettes - impartial as the day is long. But we're inside my home now and I've gotta warn you, I'm wearin' my \"wife apron\" and \"mom hat.\" So, I can safely say that I'm the mother of the most talented contestant Mount Rose has ever seen.I'll field that one - Rebecca's saving her voice.Sammy Davis, Jr., honey....Yah-then, for the \"Judges Interview,\" each girl has a ten minute get-together with the judges before the pageant...Yes, the Judges Interview.. Each girl has a ten minute get-together with the judges prior to the pageant. Then we have the...\"Hey\" to the folks.So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.All right. Number two: the judges are as nervous as you are.I'll be honest. This is a hard time for me. This is the part of the pageant when you realize that tomorrow night, all but one of these girls will walk out of here a loser. It's hard for me to know how that must feel, but I'm sure it doesn't feel good.Welcome, welcome. Okay, alright, now. Is this for me or the gown?Yah-so how kbout a big round of applause for last year's Mount Rose American Teen Princess, in a farewell performance. Who could forget her lip- synching to \"Don't Cry Out Loud,\" by Melissa Manchester. And here she is, Mary Johanson!Get back! Get back, you total retard!I'm okay, I'm okay - dress is fine. I'm okay...well, our other judges are Jean Kangas and John Dough...Thank you, thank you. You know, I won the talent contest by sewing these culottes, Butterick pattern 7-4-3-2. Can you believe it? They still fit!Thank you, thank you. Our next eontestant is ready, so let's welcome her: Tess Weinhaus!Huh?Oh really - I don't think so. Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this... This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.Oops, that's my cue.Thank you, Molly.Now, it's with overwhelming pride that I introduce contestant number six, who also happens to be president of her class - two years running - a member of the honor roll and the new President of the Lutheran Sisterhood Gun Club - Rebecca Ann Leeman!Boy, I'd hate to follow that. Wow!Welcome back, everyone. Judges. Our Second Runner-up and winner of a fifty-Our next prize, a seventy-five dollar scholarship --She's the winner and we're going to state.Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to - like a horse. C'mon, now.Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.Listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny. Now get your ass up there and show me some teeth.Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.What!This is -- what?I swear to God she can't do anything by herself.Oh my God! My Baby! The swan ate my baby! Ow-ow-ow! Get up, Rebecca! Get outta there! We've gotta go to State! Oh hot! Oh, damn. I like this blouse. Rebecca! Get up, angel face. Time to go to State! Ow-ow-ow!Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. Ah- hahahahahahahaha!Becky was my only shot at state!Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!Uh-huh. No, no. Gosh, no.

I dream of gettin' outta Mount Rose and bein' a big time reporter like Diane Sawyer. I mean, guys get outta Mount Rose all the time for hockey scholarships or prison. But the pageant's kinda my only chance.... Yah-1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.That's my mom.

It's my job.Well, you're supposed to put it in the...Then it must be Wednesday.I know.Yah-sure, fine...fine.Bye.No, listen. We shouldn't talk here. Stop by my house tonight, okay?Upset about Brett? Nah. Hazard of the trade. I don't really have time for guys anyways. It's weird, though. He took it right between the eyes. Don't often see that.Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.-- red nose and ears. I know, I know.Sorry I couldn't talk today kcause...I'm scared, okay? I open my locker right after first period and there's a picture of Tammy Curry taped inside.This was written on back.Yah-sure, Tammy liked to driver her dad's thresher - she said the heavy vibration helped her think, y'know? But I know for a fact she only smoked after a good drive. You ask me or anyone else who isn't scared to talk about it - Tammy was murdered. God, I bet Diane Sawyer never had to deal with crap like this... Toss me \"Caucasian #5,\" would ya?No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.Relax, that's my ma's code for, \"Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys.\"Oh my God - no! Is my mom okay? Was she home?Is Mom okay?Where is she?!Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.Mom, uh, about that...I-I'm-oh God...I-I'm quittin' the pageant.Oh God, I'm dead...So, what do I say?Oh my God.

I'm gonna, I-I-I'm gonna quit the pageant.Ow!Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I- I'm not goin' through this again.Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.That's it, I'm goin'...God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.I love you much.No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.No. She never hid the fact that my dad picked his career over us. What'd she used to say?Oh-yah. EXT. MOUNT ROSE STREET - MORNINGYes. Yes I am. Thank you, hello.Seriously?Well, ah...Alabama. A-L-A-B-A-M-A. Alaska. A-L-A-S-K-A. Arizona. A-R-I- Z-O-N-A.West Virginia.

But, in some kinda weird miracle, our neighbor boy, Kenny Johanson, found my tap costume on the roof-a their trailer while he was settin' coon traps for his dad. Here's the weird part. It was still on the hanger.Yah-sure, eight's my luck number anyway. Diane Sawyer was number eight at her local.Don't you get it? I was supposed to go first. I was contestant number one. That light was meant for my head. If Janelle hadn't wanted to change numbers... God, I owe my life to that deaf baby.Really, Loretta?My mom wanted me to have this?Loretta, never have kids.Oh...my...God! It's just like Diane Sawyer's! kCourse it's not a size ten, Diane was a little hippy back then. Oh, thank you! Thank you!

My-my tap costume's gone.No, wait. It-it was here before the openin' number...wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?You heard me. Where is it?I just did.Oh-oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky - bring it on.Oh, I'll \"get it.\" I'll \"get it\" all right. I might even take seconds.Bitch!I'll get you!I hate her!Here, I didn't get any.And the winner of the \"Spirit\" award goes to......Yah-it's just gone... I mean, I-I just wanna tap, y'know? I'm not sayin' I'm the best, or that I'd even win, but shouldn't I at least get a chance to compete? I just wanted my Mom to see me dance.Please, Mrs. K, I got so much Vaseline on my teeth, I'm gonna be smilin' for a year.Mrs. K--Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?This, this... This is bullshit!Good, kcause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant - it's, it's Nazi Germany!Mrs. Leeman?I-I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.But, you - I mean... It's not my fault. I-I... Please? I didn't do anything wrong...Good luck, Molly.I-I-I-I-I-, j-uh-j-uh-just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.\"Here,\" wh-wh-what?Your parents'd kill you.Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.Yah?Yah-I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.Bye mom.It's okay.Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over....Yah-well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me. I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...Yeah...Yes...Yes, Leslie!Oh-yah, this is exactly how I pictured it. Chokin' on swan gas.I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.Really?Okay.I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!Airport Ho-Jo!Loretta, don't do that.I gotta work with these women.Mount Rose American Teen Princess.Don't tell anyone, but, I have a little secret weapon of my own.I don't eat shellfish. Mom always says, \"Don't ever eat nothin' that can carry its house around with it - who knows the last time it's been cleaned.\" She should know.Oh my God. Look at her, she's awesome. I should just go home now.I, uh... I feel like... I, uh, I need a shower.I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!I'm gonna be on TV!
