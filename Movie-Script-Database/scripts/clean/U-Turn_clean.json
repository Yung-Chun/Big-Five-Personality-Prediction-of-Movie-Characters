I think the radiator hose is--Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look at my radiator hose. It's busted.So?I know it's busted. What did I just tell you?If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time. Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?Okay, I'm stuck. You happy? Now can you fix it, or not?Great!How much time?Jesus. Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.Accident.I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?It's not just a car. It's a sixty-four and half Mustang convertible. That's the difference between you and me, and why you live here and I'm just passing through.Now do you mind? I got to get some stuff out of the trunk.You want something, old man?You want something?You can't do that yourself?I'm sorry, I didn't--I don't know. I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.Christ no!I said I was sorry.Yeah, sure. You got change?All right, old man. Christ.Christ!I'll pass.I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.Oh, Jesus.What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?Hell no!Can I give you a hand, beautiful?That's right on my way.My name is Bobby. Now I'm not a stranger anymore. See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?I don't know your real name.Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.I like that about me, beautiful.May I carry your package, Grace?Jesus.I got it.No!No, I've got it.Accident.No trouble at all, really.Wasn't nothing.That's all right. I got it.You're welcome, Grace.Why you say that? Just because I help a lady with her package?I just drove in this morning.Didn't have a choice. My car overheated up the road.Not until my car's fixed. I don't know how long that's going to take.Morning, officer.Same here, officer.Well, I could use something cool.All over. Chicago, Houston, Detroit. Just lately Dallas.I guess I've got wander in my blood.I don't know. I have to make a stop in Vegas. Business to finish. Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara. I might be able to pick up some action there.Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.I pack up and go somewhere else.I couldn't stay in this place. I wouldn't. I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.Look, I'll get the money! You don't want to do this!That's good. Cools you right off. I saw you watching me.I didn't say it bothered me.I guess. I've got an ego same as any man.Nice place.Who's that, your father?Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.What do you do anyway?Where'd you learn to do that?A medicine man?Nice house for a shaman's daughter. You must be good.My face tell you all that?The same thing you do.What?Like you.Nothing like a little liveliness.I have an idea.All right, Grace. No more games.You flirt with me, then you run cold. You lead me on, then slap me down. I don't go for being jerked around.I think I can find my own way back to into town.I'm just flesh and blood, baby. That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys. But you already know that. You read my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade.Still playing?You know what I want.Who the hell are you?Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town. She needed a hand with her drapes. That's all.I swear to you that's all that happened. I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.Grace, tell him.Damn it, Grace! Tell him.You broke my nose!Goddamn it! I'm... you're lucky I don't sue you.You people are crazy!Fuckin' shithole!What the fuck do you want?Yeah...Accident.Yeah, I know. More careful.That's a solid name.Bobby Cooper.An overheated car.Darrell's a moron.California...Got work. I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.I hope so. Listen, McKenna about your wife: If I had known she was married--Wait a second--Hey!Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.Like you don't know.Would I what?I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.This is a joke, right? You just want to rattle me. Right?Who are these people?Got any cold soda?Soda. You got any soda?Soda. You know.Not eat. Drink. What the fuck is drink in Spanish ... uh, agua?It's just books.No.No! No police.No police until I leave.Hey.Nothing.Just banged my head. It was an accident.What the hell happened to my car?How much!?To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.That's a Ford, not a Ferrari. You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?What's that got to do with the radiator hose?It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.Listen, man. I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.I've got five...six dollars.I don't have a goddamn credit card.Look, I got a Movado. It's worth at least seven, eight hundred. You could sell it for that.You don't need numbers. That's why it's expensive. Look at the gold.You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.You got a beer?Beck's.Heineken?Genuine Draft?I'll fuckin' take it. To go....and a waitress named Flo. Christ.Fucking cat.What?I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.That country shit all sounds the same to me.Cause she's dead.I've had time to get over it.Oz.You're too quick for me.I wasn't doing anything.Make time? Is everybody in this town on drugs?Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.What? You want to fight? Over her?Let's see...they're not very imaginative?Fine. I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?Christ, I don't believe this!I wasn't hitting on your girl!Sure, I'll try.Cici? Cici, it's Bobby...Bobby Cooper...Yeah, look, I know it's been a while, but I'm kind of in a jam...yeah...One-hundred-fifty dollars...That's a lie. I called you on your birthday..Two years ago...I can't help it if you didn't get the message. Cici, honey, I don't want to argue. I need you to wire me the money...Because they're fucking going to KILL ME! I didn't steal your CD's...Yeah, well where's my Mr. Coffee. Cici...Cici...Bitch. Cunt.73-11, this is Pluto. What's the line on Dallas?Mike...Mike...you asshole.I know, Mr. Arkadin. I know. I was on my way to you, it's just ... what a day I've had. I know I'm coming up with a highly improbable story, and I know you're not going to believe this, but this ...is... what happened. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on my way to Vegas when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets robbed!No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they both get nailed... get shot by the old lady.With a shotgun! She kills both of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive. I mean, what are the odds?Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage. I tell you, Mister... if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know? So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see? The bus depot here has a Western Union thing. And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.But which I can get. No problem. Look, I can sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it's worth 16 at least. I just need the 150, uh...Yeah, if you could send it care of...A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.Hello?Yeah.Goddamn rat's ass fuck! Shit! Damn! Damn! Damn!Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I hate this fuckin' town! I hate it! Do you hear me? Get me outta here, please. I gotta get out of this place.I was hoping we could talk.About things. About your wife.About what you said this morning.You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife. Fifty-thousand dollars.You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.I'm not rambling.Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.Bullshit. You wanted me to kill her.You meant it.Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you... You're a jealous man Jake. If you can't have Grace to yourself...well, you're not the sharing kind.You love her, but you hate her?Make it twenty.How much could you get?I need thirteen.We're not talking about buying a car Jake. We're talking about killing your wife. It's thirteen, or it's nothing.I'm not your boy. I don't like you. I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.How do you want it?You want to do this yourself? I don't have to do this, you know.Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?And tell her what?I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.Are there snakes out here?Doesn't the isolation bother you?You love him?Did you ever?Is that why you're with him?I'm guessing no.I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.You could leave him.Walk away.You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.What's the matter?...Grace?Don't feel like nothing.Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women. You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.Try me.Nothing I understand better than a mess.You mean the Shaman?Yeah.I'm sorry...Yeah.Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.Honey, baby, I can't. I can't even get out of here myself. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...You don't have any money put away, do you?...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here.Where?What do you mean?In cash?One-hundred-thousand!? That son-of-a-bitch.If the key's on him, how do we get the key?I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.Shit! Listen to you... Are you crazy, Grace?Jesus Christ! I think this place is making me crazy. I was crazy to come back here and see you. I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute with you.I...take me back to town...No!You sure seen a lot for a blind man.That a fact?Maybe I do.I think I've heard that before.You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.What?Who's cursed?I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.I got things to do.I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.For what?I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.I wasn't going to fight for you. I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you. If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him. You're not going to get much better in this town.How old are you?No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?Oh, shit!I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?What the hell are you talking about?Yeah, I know. You're TNT. Just like dynamite. When you go off somebody gets hurt. All right. Let's do this.Will you shut up!Harlin's.No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.You've been there?You believe that?That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--What?You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it! You can't just do unauthorized work.What sign?What reputation? You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.No! Okay! Okay!Look, Harlin.Darrell. I'll get you your money. I just have to get something out of the trunk.What the fuck did you do to my trunk?And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?I need a ticket.Out of here.I ... Mexico. You got a bus that goes to Mexico? That's where I have to go.I don't care, just get me there.How much?One way.Twenty-seven, fifty. That's all I got.Please, ma'am, you don't understand! I have to get out of here. They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me. If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here. You know what I mean! I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave. Please. I can't...I can't.I'm sorry. It's just ... you know ...Holy shit!Ow!You idiot! You don't even know what you're fighting over!Get away from me!Give it to me!I'm leaving. You never have to see me again. Just please, give me the ticket!Nooo!Hello, Grace? It's Bobby.I wanted to talk.What about us?Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.Why? Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?I mean it, Grace. I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.I could if I had Jake's money.I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole. There's only one way to do that.I came back for you; this morning I came back. Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want. The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake. But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby. We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.We don't have to kill him. Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away. It was your idea, remember? I'm doing this for you. I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.Grace ... Grace?The day wasn't so bad. We all got through it all right.Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.You afraid of the dark?So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride. Is that it?Not this twig, friend. I got plans.No and I don't plan on sticking around either.You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?You are crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!It's not what you think, Jake.Wait a minute. Just listen to me...I came for Grace.It's the truth, Jake.Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today. Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace. You were going to give me thirteen-thousand. Give me two-hundred. I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy. But I need the the money. I've got to have the money.Wanna give me my gun?How 'bout the pipe?What are you talking about!Come on, Jake --O.K.! I admit it! I fucked her! But it's her you have to worry about, not me! She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit? Maybe just long enough to leave the door unlocked? Is that what happened?You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior. What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead? Let me kill her. All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it! I'll kill her!Grace, goddamit, do something!What the hell'd you wait for?No! You get it!Open up!I want my car.That's none of your business. Get the keys.Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.Course you don't. Tell me something Darrell. Forty thousand people die every day! How come none of them are you?And the trunk key.I ... nothing. I just stubbed my toe on a rock. Hurt like hell.Good thinking. What's all this?I can't see it.Hey! Take it easy. Want to get us killed?I don't know about that?We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.I'm not sailing his boat.We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?You already have.You know I thought you'd left me back there.We're gonna pull this off, Grace.He must've seen us swerving on the road, that's all, just gonna give us a ticket for swerving...Fuck this!...Just shut up, Grace. We done nothing! Be cool. Let me do the talking. He doesn't know anything.What!You fucking him too Grace? Is everybody fucking everybody in this town?Grace. No!He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...He was a cop, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...Why?And us Grace? What do we deserve?I don't want to think anymore.No Grace, my hand's bothering me.You could give me my gun back.I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else. Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now? How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared...Give me a hand.Poor old Jake, a few drinks, a fight with the sheriff over his wife. And both of 'em ended up dead.Time to go for a walk, Jake.Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three...Look, it's not so bad we split up. It might be months before they find these guys. If at all. I mean with the mountain lions around here. Remember, if they can't find no bodies, there's no crime... We'll be in Phoenix by noon. Lose this car, get another one. Texas, Mexico are big countries, all that money Grace, you'll meet someone else, you know, there's a lot of hope with a $100,000...But we all need that too. Hold him.You make a pretty couple.Won this in a poker game in Reno. God knows who it's registered to. You shoulda been more careful, Jake. See you later.Now all we got to do is try and--Grace! Help me, Grace...! We been through too much together. We've only had one day, but you and me have been through more than most people ever will. I know you were angry at me, and, you know, you were right! I'm sorry I hit you. I was wrong about leaving you. You don't belong in Mexico.Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.I busted my leg!Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.I can't throw that far. You got to climb down here and get the keys. You can make it. It's the only way Grace.Grace!...Please, Grace! You have to help me.'Cause I love you.And love's a funny thing. Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you......or kill you.I love you Grace, but I just can't trust you!He can't help you now, honey!You're still lucky.", "clean_line": "goddamn road fuck shit oh

I could drive up.It's just new drapes and curtain rods. If I had known it was going to be so heavy I would have had them delivered up to the house.I just got tired of looking at the old drapes. My mother made them. Had them long as I can remember. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending. But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself. I deserve nice things.This is it.Thank you, Bobby.You're not from around here, are you?You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.Drove into Superior? What for?You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert. Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.Anybody hurt?Well, I guess I could use some help getting this box into the house. Not far. You could shower, get something cool to drink.Where you coming from?You've been around.Where you headed?So, what is it you do, Mister...?I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work. You must like taking chances.What happens when you lose?Sometimes I feel the exact same way.Thought you might like a refill on your lemonade.I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.Did you like it; me watching you?Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.Thank you.No. Not really.I guess it must.A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.From my father. He was the tribe's shaman.Those are white words, not ours.Come here.There's something in your past; something you want to keep hidden. There's a pain. Something ... someone you can't forget. And there is something you want very badly. It seems very far away to you, but you are determined, and you will do what you must to get it.It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want. What is it you want?Really? I want to hang drapes.Hold me.Tighter. I won't break. You know girls are a lot tougher than men think.There. All done. Lift me down.Lift me down.You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?Beautiful?I like them. I was sick of looking at this room. I think they add a little life.No more drapes to hang. Now what should we do?And what would that be?Really? And what game did you want to play? You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.You never did answer my question.That's not an answer. What is it you want?Maybe I just want to hear you say it.How do you know he's still not here?They hear you comin'. They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.Yeah, but I like the sun. I grew up on a reservation. The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us. Jake's the same way. He loves the desert. I guess we're alike that way. That's about the only way.No.Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?Yeah, I guess you're right.I'm still here, aren't I? See this?All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me. He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond. More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.I don't know how.It's not that easy. Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please. I can't. I don't want to be alone. I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.Is that so bad? It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy. For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would ... do things for him. I guess I'm no good that way. I guess I tried to sucker you along like that. Do you hate me for it? I wouldn't blame you if you did. But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.I wish I was a bird. I know it's stupid. Every child says that. When I was growing up some of the old ones on the reservation believed people could actually change into animals. I wish I could.If I was a bird I would fly to Florida; to Disney World. I always wanted to go there. I'd fly to New York. Maybe. I guess New York isn't the best place to be a bird. I'd fly to St. Louis, then New Orleans, all over Texas. Then I'd fly to California. I guess by then I'd have seen it all and I could die.They say you don't feel anything. The shock kills you before you hit the ground. I don't know how they would know that. But I heard it's just like flying; straight down into the ground. I guess if it doesn't hurt it's a beautiful thing.Hate's a funny thing. Right now I bet you don't know if you want to kill me, or fuck me.No...Stop! I can't!Nothing.Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.You'd never understand.It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...He was a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his \"little halfbreed\"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see... ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted more. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, really taken -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...Yeah. What do you want. Life, right? Have you ever been to California?Is it pretty?Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.Darrell? You know he and Jake are...Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...There's money. A lot.Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...It takes a key. He keeps it on himself all the time. I mean all the time. It scratches up against me when we do it.Kill him.It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to feel it... I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...But it's in you, Bobby. I see it. I see Death. It's in your heart. Let it out for me. Let it out...Do it for me, Bobby, you'll never regret it. I promise you. I'll do anything for you. Anything.You need the money, Bobby. It's a lot more than $100,000. A lot more. How are you going to get out of here? You need the money. Whatever it takes, Bobby, remember?Where you going? I'll give you the ride...Come back! Bobby? It's three miles.I don't think we have anything to talk about.There is no us, remember?Stop it.Because I know you're full of shit.I thought you couldn't get your car.Is that what changed your mind? The money?Are you sure?... About me, I mean?You said you couldn't kill anybody.After dark. I'll leave the back door unlocked.Wrong number.I put up new drapes, Jake.You never said anything. About the drapes.You haven't even looked at them once.I picked them out for you, Jake. I thought you would like the colors.Nothing, Jake. Absolutely nothing.Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!No! No! Please!What's the matter?Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.Jake!Like you helped her, Jake?The money's right here! Get the key!Didn't I tell you?We done it, Bobby. Oh my God!Fuck me baby!Let him watch. I want him to know what he's missing.Bobby? What the hell's the matter with you?I got the money all packed. I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away. Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.I'm not coming back.Funny thing; the jeep wouldn't start. I had to push it.It should be just up ahead. Hold on ... there! There it is!Oh, God! I can't believe it. I'm out. I'm finally out!You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.Can't we just dump him fast someplace?Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?But I thought --Anywhere?Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.What are you talking about?I love you Bobby.Oh, my God! Don't stop!Keep going!OK...but he never made me cum! Really Virgil, I was only doing what I had to do so we could be free. Just like we talked about. It meant nothing.No baby, you got it wrong.It's not like that it... Look, Virgil, I got the money here.All talk, that's all you did was talk, and all I did was sit around getting older waiting for you to free me! You never did nothin' Virgil, you're weak! He did!You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.Stop! Stop it!Goddamnit Virgil, stop! Don't!No...you! You!Help me get him off the road. Into the car! We'll ditch his car... Get the fuck up!Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you and me.The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.He was a scumbag!... He wanted me, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're dead... You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.So, aren't you going to ask me?Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that?Yes! I was! I was fucking Daddy! And I married him!... I married him...okay?I don't know why!All I wanted was to be a kid... He took that from me... They all did... They treated me like meat. A piece of meat. Fuck me. Blow me. Bend over. Stick their fingers up my ass... Fuck them! Fuck the whole town! They deserved to die!It's easy to judge someone else when you don't know nothing about it... I'm Apache, Bobby. You don't eat what I eat. You don't see what I see. Don't judge me.See ya, Virgil. God bless.You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?Why don't we just finish what we started.You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?You hit me, Bobby? You hit a woman, you motherfucker! Didn't your Momma ever teach you anything...?Well?Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?You don't know your own mind. It blocks your heart.My mother died in this canyon.Hope is a four-letter word.Shit!Bobby? Are you all right?Can you make it back up?Bobby, the trunk...it's locked. Throw the keys up to me. I'll get the rope.Okay. I'm coming.
