Why are we stopping?Excuse me, why has the train stopped?But if they block the track, the train can't go...YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM MOVE.Oh, they won't move. We are gonna die here. Leo, Leo, go and say something to them. It's the only way we are gonna get out of here.Darling.This is impossible! It really is! These people are parasites! Look... \"Countess Tolstoy has become estranged from her husband. They barely speak.\"You know who spreads all this rubbish....C'est la meme en France. They gossip about us in Paris... \"They do not share a similar view of either religion or politics.\" Incroyable!I think it's none of the world's business.What are you doing? Don't do that.Darling, where are you going?Leovochka, why do you insist on dressing like that.Like the man who looks after the sheep.But it does offend me, because it offends reason. You're a Count, for God's sake.Oh darling, I have something else to say.These people have nothing.It's not for lack of land that the muzhiks live in poverty. They have no will power and they drink too much.It's all ridiculous. You think that poverty makes the peasants somehow morally superior.Oh, I know all about the movement.No, they'd spend it on drink and whores.Stop scribbling! You all think he's Christ, don't you? He thinks he's Christ.But what?This is unbearable. No wonder I feel lonely. I'm surrounded by morrons.Am I? I sit here and listen to this talk of love and God and equality, knowing full well that Count Generosity here is fully prepared to give away everything we have.STOP IT! STOP WRITING NOW!I see a fine young man before me. Clear eyes. Nice features, rather handsome in a peculiar way.Call me Sofya Andreyevna. We don't stand on formality here, as you may have observed. Many young men ruin their looks by loose living. You're a real Tolstoyan, I can tell!That's excellent. He likes that.He's very grateful for the help you've been giving him. He told me so himself. I think it surprises him that a young man would be so diligent. When he was your age, he was whoring in the Caucasus.He wrote it all down. He even gave me a copy, so I could read all the details...You've read War and Peace?When he was writing it, long before Chertkov created that monstrosity at Telyatinki, before all this \"new religion\" and revolutionary nonsense... What do you think of Chertkov, by the way?But you see what a fool he is, a self-serving puritanical idiot. I have to say, it's been extremely pleasant since they've locked him in his house.When my husband was writing it, in the mid-sixties, he'd bring me pages to re-copy everyday. I was the only one who could read his handwriting. I could read his intentions, too. Afternoons, we'd drink tea and discuss changes. \"Natasha wouldn't say that to Prince Andrey,\" or \"Pierre's too simple here. He's not stupid.\"But I don't count anymore.You must help me, Valentin Fedorovich. I want only what is best for my husband and my family. I could tolerate the situation if it only concerned me What I can not do is sit back while they steal my children's inheritance. Do you know I was the only person. I could understand his intention.I have a little gift for youIt's a diary. Everyone should always keep a diary.You're teasing me, but I trust you'll write the truth.Nonsense. You've been listening to your friends at Telyatinki... Write what you see. That's always the place to begin. What. You. See.More tea?He'll try again to convince your father to change his will.To give the copyright as \"a gift to humanity.\"...the reptile.You're a fine son, darling. None of this make believe chastity and made up religion. I wish all my children had turned out like you.Chertkov's notions of virtuous behavior are calculated to destroy me.There is nothing more pathetic than impoverished aristocrats.Vladimir Grigorevich, what a surprise.And I'm happy to make you happy...always.I'm fine...now that you're home.Did I really? I don't believe it. Not you. I'm your little bird. You know the sounds I make.It brought you back to me.Come out of the dark... where I can see you.Look at me. This is who I am. This is what you married. We're older, maybe we're old, but I'm still your little chicken You're still my big cock.Let me make you crow.Let me make you sing.Do you love me?Good morning, my darling? Do you mind if I join you?It's quite insane, my darling. Everyone is making fun of you.Even the muzhiks. I heard them laughing in the barn.I don't want to ruin last night.Laughing about the fact that you've developed a senile crush on a fat middle aged flatterer. Your passion for Chertkov has become a standing joke.But it's not amusing, darling. It's sick. It's not normal. You hang on his every word.You have nothing in common. You are a genius. He's a sycophant and a pervert.He is using you. You just can't seem to see it.That bold, obese, idiotic man. You treat him...Do you love me, Lyovochka?Then why would you betray me?Because of the will?The new will.Does Chertkov have it?But that's why he's come back. You talk about it, you and your boyfriend. You plan for it. You have no heart for the people who really love you. You'd rather be seduced by charlatans and deluded by flatterers, all in the name of love....You can't even love your own children. You can't even love me.Tell me where it is?Then, promise me there never will be.Tomorrow, I'll go to the Station and lie down on the track. Tolstoy's wife becomes Anna Karenina herself! See how the papers will like that!And I'm happy to make you happy...always.Your moustache is...Let me get to the point. Vladimir Grigorivich, I don't wish to be your enemy. I'm delighted that my husband has a friend who understands and shares his ideals. All I want is what's reasonable - an opportunity to evaluate the new will. If you agree, I'm sure we can be friends.Leo Nikolayevich has agreed, hasn't he Val-Very well.Yes. Valentin Fedorovich...are you coming back to the house with me?Have you been keeping something from me? How delightful.We've become close friends, I think. Tell me everything, dear boy. I love a romance.A young woman in your life is nothing?A lover?That sounds serious enough.I don't mean to annoy you.You forget that I'm an experienced reader. I can read your face, every letter. It's beautifully clear. Do you love her?Not something they'd understand, these so called disciples of my husband. They've never understood a word he's written. What do any of them know about love?Ivan, who's wearing that awful perfume?How dare you?You're all plotting against me. In my own house, too. I bear you thirteen children. How can you betray me like this? Someone help me up.Give everything you've got to him, your fat little catamite. \"What will it be, my dearest dear, my Vladimir Grigorivich? My wife's heart on a platter? Her kidneys? With salt? But of course, my dear Chertkov, whatever pleases you. The china. The estate. Permanent copyright on everything I've ever written? Anything for you, my love.\"Give me that. Give it to me, you little weasel.Now...You! Don't think you deceive me for one little moment! I know exactly what you're doing. I want to see the will. It's my right, in the name of god.You. I'm afraid of you.Tell them anything you like. Go ahead. Ruin us.Why can't my husband see you for what you are?Do you like the opera?This aria is very beautiful.. It is about a woman who is abandoned by the man who loves her...Everyone is very moved by that...in the opera.Sit down, Valentin.No, no, no. Enjoy your dinner. We've had a disagreement. No more than any other married couple.Of course...Why should it be easy? I'm the work of your life. You're the work of mine. Its what love is.Everything with him is hystericsGo? Where?Go where?Then go! Go! Anywhere you please!I hate you. I hate what you've become.You'll destroy me.My back. My back... I'm hurting.Ya...your...your...I can\u00b4t remember now...Yo, what did I say? What did you mean?Lyovochka? Prozeveskeny wants to purchase the rights to your work after your death.Don't be silly. They've offered one million rubles.How can you not be pleased?Where are you going?Splendid...while your wretched family is left to starve.But you're always first to the trough...always have been.How could you do this to me?You hurt me again and again. You take little pieces of me until I become nothing. I don't know who I am anymore. I read your diary. I know what you've done.No! Give me the gun!You're a liar. Liar!So, he's gone. For good.DON'T PLAY GAMES WITH ME.Let me die. Please. Why would you rob me of that?Ivan, go to the station. Find out which train the master took.They've all goneYou're writing to your girl. That's lovely.But you believe you'll see her again.Yes. Refuse to believe in the end of love. Do all you can to prevent it...I know you know where he is, Valentin.I won't ask you to betray his trust...but I need you to go to him. I do. I have to see him. I have to talk to him. I won't make a scene. Promise him that. I must see him.Tell him we've received an apologetic letter from your father..very embarrassed. We expect him back any day...Yes, that's a lie.We must leave at once.We'll rent a train.Don't say irrelevant things, Andrey. It's unbecoming. Contact someone. I'll go and pack.I'll see what I can do, father.I want to see my husband.I want to see him. Now!Valentin...Will you help me? I have to see him. Please.It is. It's the right time for me.I want to see my husband.But he's not too weak to see you. Not too weak to see that...I am the leper outside the gate, while he sleeps with the devil himself.Is that true?Have you told him I nearly drowned in the pond?What did he say?He'd be upset?I want to see him. He's not your husband. He's my husband.And you are a stone-hearted bitch of a daughter.I lost five children. Why couldn't one of them have been you?Valentin, will you take me back?I've behaved badly, haven't I?Has he asked for me?Lyovochka!Please forgive me, my darling!I'm a fool.. I'm a selfish woman. But I love you. Please believe me. Please understand me. Please forgive me for all my weakness and badness. Please! Please! Love me!Was I shouting?You don't speak, but I hear you.\"Do you love me, Lyovochka.\" \"Never stopped, my little bird.\" \"And you will never stop\" \"Never.\" \"Nor ever leave me again.\" \"Never, ever again. \"Good...good... let's go home\"Please forgive me if I cry a little now.It's alright. What happens from now on... it will never really matter. Not really. Everything's finished.Dushan, could you tell them your great friend is gone?My husband needs no justification. Besides, it\u00b4s been enough talking as it is. Thank you, father.Valentin... and who's this...This is your girl. Good. Good. Is there anything I can do for you?Yes...Good bye, good bye.
