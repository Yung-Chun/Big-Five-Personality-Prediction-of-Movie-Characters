She faces Peter with a, hiss, her fangs sparkling in the moonlight.Peter Vincent, vampire killer! He rushes her, the stake held high to plunge into her breast and the CAMERA TURNS AWAY from the TV as the sounds of the movie CROSS FADE with the SOUNDS OF HEAVY BREATHING, LIPS MEETING, TONGUES INTERTWINING in the room itself. Only the room, a typical teenager's lair, seems devoid of life, the bed empty, schoolbooks untouched sitting on the desk. The CAMERA BEGINS TO SEARCH the room, looking for the source of this new sound, much more interesting than the old flick on the tube. And then it finds them, CHARLEY BREWSTER and AMY PETERSEN, two sixteen-year olds, on the floor to the far side of the bed, wedged between the bed and the window. They are both as American as their jeans and making out like crazy. They twis.t and turn on the floor, Amy alternating between enjoy- ing it and fighting Charley off, both of them white hot with their mutual need. As he tries to slip his hand under her blouse, she catches-a glimpse of the TV. The horror movie has faded out to be replaced by the interior of a local TV studio, a tacky graveyard set the centerpiece, the visage of Peter Vincent, much older now, rising out of a papier mache coffin and filling the screen as CREDITS END.This is Peter Vincent, bringing you' Fright Night Theatre. Tonight's journey into horror is \"Blood Castle,\" one of my favorites. And for a very good season. I star -in it. He does this booming laugh that goes through about ten echo chambers as Charley, totally oblivious to the TV, works on Amy's bra, trying to get it undone, obviously something she doesn't want. She tries to distract him.Hello, horror fans. I hope you're enjoying \"I, A Vampire Part Two.\" It's one of my best. Did you know a lot of people don't believe in vampires?But I do. Because I know they exist. I have faced them inn. all their guises, men, wolves, bats. And I have always won. That's why they call me The Great Vampire Killer.All right, what do you want me to sign?Well, you want my autograph, don't you?What about it?Absolutely. Unfortunately none of your generation seems to be.That I have been fired because no one wants to see vampire killers anymore. Or vampires either. Apparently all they want are demented madmen running around in ski masks hacking up young virgins. Now if'you'll excuse me -- Be starts for his car again, Charley falling in beside him.Pardon me?Yes.If this is your idea of a joke, I am not amused.Yes.Now what' can I do for you? An autograph or an interview for your school newspaper?Are you two serious? My dear, your friend needs a psychiatrist, not'a vampire killer.I'm afraid not, my dear. You see, Hollywood beckons. I've been offered a starring role in a major movie. I've even had to quit Fright Night. So you see, I'mHow much?I'll take it. Now how are we going to cure your little friend of this delusion?It sounds fine to me, but how do we get this next door neighbor to agree?Ask him how he feels-about holy water?Tell him it'll-be just ordinary tap water and all he has to do is take a sip. Evil Ed turns back to the phone.Charley Brewster, I presume? Peter Vincent, vampire killer. And now down to business. Where is the lair of this suspected creature of the night?Well, shall we?I have to prove he's a vampire before I kill him, Charley.But I am the one that has to know, Charley. This is holy water. If it touches him, he'll blister- and in this case I asked him to drink it while we all watched. He readily agreed.Yes. Which doesn't exactly strengthen your case, does it? Now, shall we go. He takes a step up the walk. Charley grabs his arm.No, he won't, Charley. Not with me here to protect you. After all, I'm Peter Vincent.. ' -Of course, Charley, of course. But then he's never dealt with me before either.Perhaps he didn't hear you.This is Ed Thompson and Amy Peterson.It's perfectly all right, Mr. Vincent. Where is the, ah, holy water?Positive. I saw Father Scanlon bless it down at Saint Mary's myself. Jerry takes the vial from his-hand, pulling the stopper, and sniffing at it, for the first time nervousness creeping into his manner.. Charley sidles up to Amy, whispering in her ear as Jerry prepares to drink the water.Totally.You just saw it, Charley. You know as well as I do that no vampire could drink blessed water.Charley, you've already made a fool of yourself once. There's no reason to compound the error.No, no, just my clumsiness. Come along, we must be going. Thank you again, Mr. Dandrige He ushers the teenagers out the front door as Jerry watches, puzzled by his sudden change in attitude.Nothing. He stops by his car, fumbling his keys-out of his pocket, hardly able to fit them into the lock with his trembling hands.They're- not shaking. Be finally gets the door open, hurriedly sliding in behind the wheel, slamming the door behind them. Charley leans down, speaking through the partially open window.Will you be quiet.No, of course not.All right. He didn't cast a reflection in my mirror. Satisfied now?Who is it?What do you want?What are we going-to do?Back.Back, I say, back --Yes. Charley cups one hand over his ear, bending dawn to hear better. Behind hint Amy slowly disappears down the hall- way and onto the dance floor.I'm sorry, Charley. I-can't do that.You have to understand, Charley. Ed's one of them now. He just tried to kill me. If I try to go out he'll kill me for sure.Who is it?Are you one of them, too?Here, grab this. Charley does as told. Peter peers at his hand. No smoke. He hurriedly slips the chain from the door and pulls the boy inside.Leaving.Wanna bet? Watch me. Peter closes the suitcase, hurrying for the door. Charley steps in front of him, blocking his path.Oh, my God.I can't. I was paid to be there today.And you still want me to help you?(looking up at him,I'm sorry, Charley.I am serious. Ee drops to his knees, pulling an assortment of his movie props out of his leather bag.This. From Orgy of the Damned.He walks around during the day, doesn't he?Not now. But Peter isn't really paying attention to Charley. His eyes are on that malevolent looking house, the house looming larger and larger above him as they get closer and closer. Peter begins to slow, his nerve draining away as the true- evilness of the. place begins to eat at him. He finally comes to a halt, staring at the house. Charley stops, looking. back.. Nothing, nothing at all.Are you crazy? Not through the front door. Let's go around to the back and sneak in The front door slowly swings open on creaking hinges, seemingly of its own accord. Peter and Charley turn to look at it, a dark gaping hole like an open mouth, ready to swallow them.I'm Peter Vincent, the great vampire killer. I'm -- They disappear into the house, Jerry Dandrige suddenly .stepping INTO FRAME, staring after them.Let's wait until dawn. He'll be in his coffin then. We'll have a better chance of getting Amy.(in his vampire killerMrs. Brewster! No answer. He grabs the phone from the table and punches out a number, speaking hurriedly into it.Hello, operator, get me the police. Operator? No response, not even a dial tone. He holds the phone up only to see the cord has been ripped from the wall. His eyes widen in horror, his gaze snapping back up the stairs. PETER Mrs. Brewster -- He plunges up the stairs.Mrs. Brewster, thank God. All the phones have been ripped from theWhere's Charley's mother?Charley.Quick, grab her and let's get out ofNot if we kill Dandrige before dawn.'So far everything's just like in the movies. We'll just have to keep on hoping. And the CAMERA STOPS outside the bedroom window, watch- ing as Charley grabs the stake Dandrige dropped on the floor, and heads for. the door.Stop or I'll shoot. Billy stops, still smiling at him,. their eyes locked for what seems like an eternity. Then Billy starts up the stairs toward him again. Peter points the gun at Billy with trembling hands.I mean it. Don't force me toNothing. He's just bluffing. Charley continues up the stairs-slowly, the cross held out in front of him, Peter hugging his back. Behind them, down at the foot of the stairs,,Billy slowly sits up. Peter and Charley continue climbing, their gazes fixed ahead. Behind them Billy stands and starts to walk up the stairs toward them, the first STEP he hits GROANING under his heavy weight. Charley and Peter freeze, turning to look back. They see the huge man coming up the stairs toward them, a thin trail of blood leaking from the bullet hole in his forehead. Peter whips his pistol out with trembling hands and UNLOADS THE ENTIRE REVOLVER into the man, casting a pale of gunsmoke in front of him and Charley, obscuring their view of the stairway below. Suddenly Billy Cole appears through the thick cloud, back- ing them up the stairs. Peter stumbles, falling backward, .unable to rise in time. Billy leans down, grabbing him and jerking him into the air like a ragdoll.,. about to fling him over the ballustrade to the floor far below. Charley suddenly leaps forward, slamming his stake into the creature's heart.No, he, certainly wasn't. Peter scrambles to his feet, he'and Charley backing hurriedly up the stairs, terrified by what they've seen. i 143 INT. AMY'S ROOM - NIGHT They rush into Amy's room, Peter stopping to stare at the open window, left that way by Dandrige when he entered and left. Charley ignores it, hurrying to Amy, and kneeling by her side. He gently turns her over to expose lengthening bicuspids as Peter sticks his head out the window. Her irises are now more red than before, signaling the trans- ition she is making from the living to the walking dead.He's in the attic. They rush to the attic door, the two men disappearing up the dark stairs.There, his-coffin. Both of them approach, staring down at the long chest. Peter hands the flashlight to Charley, pulling a stake from his pocket, a hammer from his belt. He raises the stake in the air, the hammer ready. He nods at the coffin.Open i t. Charley throws his shoulder against the lid, heaving. The lid opens with a GROAN, Peter about to stab down only to find it empty.Well, now we know where he is.Where the hell is he? And in the window directly behind his back, Jerry rises up out of the dark, no more than a few feet away, only 'a thin pane of glass separating Peter from his clawed hand. He raises it to strike through the glass at Peter just as .Charley slides in the open window at the far end from the roof and sees Jerry in the window behind Peter.. He screams out.You take downstairs, I'll take upCharley! Charley comes running down the hall, stopping at the bottom of the stairs, staring up at Peter..I thought I heard something.I don't know. Just my nerves, I guess.Keep searching for him. Se's got to be close. It's almost dawn. Charley heads back down the hallway toward the basement as above on the landing, Peter stares around, about to try another door when suddenly the huge stained glass window directly behind and above him bursts apart in an EXPLOSION OF SHATTERING GLASS and Jerry Dandrige plunges in from the outside, landing in a crouch before Peter. He rises as the. older man backs away. Charley rushes down the hail back into the portico, brought by the sound of the crash. He's about to start up the stairs when Dandrige turns and stares down at him. Charley ignores him, starting up the stairs. Peter speaks to him, never taking his gaze from Dandrige.Stay there, Charley -- Charley freezes, staring up at the vampire and the man above, watching, waiting. Dandrige's gaze bores into Peter.Back!Look over your shoulder. Dandrige cranes his neck to see the rising dawn through the open window, the sun beginning to glint its golden rays even as he stares at it. He turns back to Peter, roaring with fury.Are you all right?Quick, he's in the basement. He helps the boy. down the hall, the two of them disappear- ing through the basement door. A second later the attic DOOR above RIPS FROM ITS HINGES, CRASHING to the floor. Amy steps out of the attic, her eyes sightless, a stake grasped in her hand.' She walks like an automaton down the stairway toward the portico below..Quick, his coffin has to be hereWhat was that?Charley, I found it -- Back at the other end of the room, Charley is backing away from Amy as she slowly stalks him, the stake she picked up in the attic-in her hands. Charley yells back at Peter.He'_s locked it somehow from the inside.. He grabs a hammer from his pocket and starts pounding at the clasps, trying to free them while at the side of the room Charley continues to back away from Amy, calling back.This is Peter Vincent, once more back with you as host of Fright Night. I thought I'd let the vampires rest for a little while. Right, Charley?

The police won't listen to me,.my mother thinks I'm crazy, you two, even Peter Vincent thinks I'm nuts.I told you, I already tried him.Why should he believe you anymore than he did me?Fat chance.No, you're right there.Who is it?He did. When?Honest?'It's six ten. He said he'd be here at six, right?Mr. Vincent, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this -- Peter slowly gets out of the car, stretching to his full height. He wears his vampire killer regalia, the Victorian suit, and carries a small leather satchel. There is some- thing truly majestic about him.. He looks down at Charley, laying it on. with a trowel.(pointing at theWhere're your stakes and hammer?But I know he's a vampire.But, Mr. Vincent, if I'm right and you prove he's a vampire, he'll kill us all right then and there.Get ready to run. I'll protect you with this. He edges a cross out of his pocket, just giving her a glimpse of it. He glances up just as Jerry lifts his head back and. downs the contents of the vial in one swallow. He 1 7 7 turns to Peter triumphantly.But, it can't be --Then it wasn't blessed!If he's not a vampire, then have him touch this? Jerry stiffens, his face losing its color, but none of the others notice. They're all looking askance at Charley. Peter steps up to the boy.No, no, of course not.,Yes. Jerry smiles at him and the tension suddenly flows out of the room. Billy even smiles. Jerry steps forward, usher- ing them all toward the portico.C'mon, let's get out of here --What's wrong with you?Then why are your hands shaking?You saw something in there, didn't you, something that convinced you he was a vampire?Is Jerry Dandrige a vampire or not?Please, Mr. Vincent, you have to tell me. Our lives depend on it.Mr. Vincent, you have to call the Polic e-and tell them -- The-ENGINE finally CATCHES, and he ROARS away in a cloud of burning rubber, Charley watching him go, half frustrated to death.Well, at least you two heard him.You felt how evil Dandrige was, didn't you, Amy? Remember the way he looked at you?Where are you going?Wait a minute. We walk Amy home first.Because it's after dark, pencil.dick, and there's a vampire back there! Be points back at the Dandrige house. Evil Ed just stares at him.No way. We want people and lights, the more the better.What if you're wrong, Evil? What if Dandrige is a vampire and he thinks you know it. Would you walk down that alley then? The hair on the back of Evil Ed's neck starts to stand on end. Then he denies it.Ed, please, just stick with us.Where is he? Amy spots him laying crumpled against a wall.Ed, Ed, are you all right? Nothing from Evil Ed. Charley looks at Amy.Jesus, I warned him -- Evil Ed's eyes suddenly snap open, staring up wildly at Charley.You asshole, you fucking asshole! Evil Ed rolls on the ground in hysterics, pointing at him, and laughing loudly.You'll get yours someday, Evil. He grabs Amy's hand and walks back down the alley toward the street and the lights. Evil Ed yells after him.How much further?What was that?Amy, what if Evil really was in trouble?(to Army, in aI think we lost him.It's all right, Amy. He kisses her, takes her hand, and they start walking up the bridge.We've got it made And they freeze.' There, high above them on one of the arches of the bridge, so high up no one could possibly get there unless they flew, stands Jerry Dandrige, staring down at them. With a scream, they whirl, racing off the bridge and down the street.Over here --(lying through hisHe doesn't believe me.I won't let him get you, Amy. I promise.She can't handle this, Amy.We don't have-any choice, Amy. Now give me his number. She reluctantly digs a scrap of paper out of her pocket as Charley drops another dime.C'mon; Mr, Vincent, answer, please, answer. Unseen by either of them, Jerry Dandrige sweeps through the front door of the club, moving like a god among mere mor- tals, his eyes, now glowing a faint red, sweeping the crowd of dancers as he moves toward the dance floor.Answer me, damnit, answer me -- Behind him Amy stiffens, staring out onto the dance floor at the sea of people. Moving through the dancers like a golden god moving amid mere mortals walks Jerry Dandrige. The hot, colored lights of the dance floor highlight his hair, accentuating his gracefulness, making him seem even more beautiful than he is. He stops just at the edge of the floor and holds his hand out to Amy, the orgiastic dancing swirling on behind him, the pounding, SENSUAL BEAT OF THE FUNK ROCK washing over them both. His eyes burn into hers, willing her to come to him. Terrified, she turns back toward Charley. In that moment Jerry disappears from the mouth of the hallway, Amy turn- ing back just as she's about to grab Charley only to see he's gone. She stops, more intrigued than frightened, the image of that beautiful man holding out his hand to her sharp in her mind. She takes a step forward down the hall, continuing down the hall until she has a clear view of the dancers. Jerry's nowhere to be seen. Behind her., . Charley is just about to turn and glance. in her direction when a voice answers on the other end of the line.Mr. Vincent, this is Charley Brewster. You gotta help us. Jerry Dandrige has me and Amy trapped in this club --If you don'\"t, Dandrige'll kill us! He's so into what he's saying on the phone, he doesn't even realize Amy's gone.God damn him. He-won't help us -- -Only Amy is gone, the hallway empty. Charley rushes toward the dance floor.Pardon me, have you seen a girl,I'm looking for a girl --Let her go! Jerry looks down at him, smiling, mocking him as Amy sways in his arms, her eyes locked on. his face.You filthy son-of-a-bitch -- ! He swings at him only to have Jerry release Amy, catching Charley's fist in the palm of his hand easily. Be stares down at the boy, smiling cruelly.You can't kill me here --That's her, over there with that olderC'mon, quick -- But it's. too late already. Donny screams as the talons whistle through the air, tearing his throat out in one swipe, scattering blood everywhere, blinding several of the dancers swirling.by, hitting people drinking at the bar, a couple necking in a corner, blood flying everywhere. Jerry steps around the corpse as it topples backward over a table of coke users, the bouncer's dead eyes staring up at them. Leon dashes up, - lunging for Jerry. The vampire's hand snaps out, grabbing`him by the throat, squeezing, driving those claws deep into the man's neck, holding him like a chicken, enjoying a second of his death throes and then casually flinging him into the center of the floor, bringing the music and all the dancing to a shrieking halt as this new group of people stare at another dead body.Hold on to me -- Suddenly Jerry steps out in front of them and sweeps Amy away from. him, the crowd flowing around Charley and carry- ing him off in the opposite direction as he fights and screams to get back to her.Charley Brewster. Let me in.What are you talking about? Peter thrusts his cross out through the crack.'What are you, doing?You can't.Dandrige has Amy. He says he'll kill her unless we come to his house. Peter stops, staring at Charley, stunned. The blood drains from his face.No, they won't believe you. I've tried.I know.Yes. You're Peter Vincent, the Great Vampire Killer.I can't do it alone, Peter. If you don't help, Amy's going to die. And me, too, probably. r Please, Peter.(quietly, of ter aWhat if he's not human? Bullets aren't going to stop him then.What's wrong?Too late. Be starts moving up the porch toward the door. Peter moves with him, his gaze fixed on that gaping mouth of an open doorway, mumbling to himself as he goes.This way. They start up the stairway.Amy'll be dead by then, too. NowWhere's Amy?Stop! Jerry stops, staring at the cross. Charley starts up the stairs toward him, the cross held in front of him.We're gonna make.it -- Billy Cole suddenly steps out of the darkness in front of him, rips the cross from the boy's hand and viciously backhands him across the face. With a scream, Charley smashes through the. stairway railing, plunging to the hallway floor below. He lands with a solid thud, lying there, groaning. Jerry steps in front of Billy, staring down at Peter on the stairway, smiling at him. Then he slowly starts down the stairs toward Peter. With a scream, the actor whirls, racing down the steps and out the front door.(staring up at himYou bastard! .Jerry casually knocks him aside, flinging him through the air against the far wall with his incredible strength. Charley crumples to the floor, stunned. Jerry walks over to him and drops a wooden stake at his feet.No!Peter? PETER I'm going to have to break the door down. Make as much noise as you can. Charley turns to the wall, beating on it and yelling for all he's worth.Help, let me out!We can't. Look. He falls to his knees beside Amy and rolls her over for Peter to see. She is still covered with sweat and trembling even more violently now. Her upper lip slips back revealing lengthening fangs, just the beginning ofIs it too late to save her?Are you sure?Let's go -- He and Peter hurry out the door, the CAMERA WATCHING them go.Come on, we have him -- Dandrige's gaze snaps past Charley's shoulder, down into the shadows at the bottom of the stairs where Billy's body lies, his eyes glowing as they burn into the corpse for a moment before shifting back to Charley and Peter. He smiles at the boy.What did he mean?No! Billy Cole freezes, his eyes widening. Be drops Peter crashing to the steps and staggers back, grabbing the rail for support, hanging there below Peter and Charley for what seems an eternity, the stake protruding from his heart.. As the two watch in horror, Cole's face slowly begins to dissolve, skin putrefying and slipping away, revealing the grinning skull beneath, the process of dissolution acceler- ating as the seconds tick past. Suddenly the legs turn to bone and.what remains of the body, no more than a skeleton in clothes now, tumbles backward down the stairs with a clatter, to land with a crash on the floor below, bones rolling in-every direction across the portico. They stare down the stairs at his remains.Be wasn't human.Peter! Peter ducks in just as Jerry's about to strike.She's worse. C'mon, we're running out of time -- The two men rush out of the room.Where is he? The CAMERA BEGINS TO DRIFT up the side of the house toward the attic window above.Well, he was here -- The beam moves on, only to suddenly stop on a large chest shoved in a corner.God' damn him. Where is he?Yeah, but what's he doing up there?I'm going up there. He heads for the open window at the far end of the attic nearest the stairs.Peter, behind you! Peter whirls, holding up his cross and as quickly as he appeared from the night, Jerry slips back into it, leaving Peter staring at the window, terrified at the close call as Charley reaches his' side.You okay?Oh, my God -- Suddenly they hear Dandrige cruelly laughing at them from the floor below, laughing like this is the best joke he's ever heard..He's downstairs now -- Amy suddenly launches herself at Charley, seizing.him by the throat and throwing him to the floor, landing on top of him. He grabs her by the shoulders, holding her back as she tries to plunge her fangs into his neck. Peter steps up behind her, a stake raised in his hands, about to plunge it into her back. Charley screams up at him.No! Peter shifts his grip on the stake, holding it like a club, and brings it slamming down on her back. She collapses un- conscious on top of Charley. He shoves her off, climbing to his feet, and turning toward the staircase to the floor below.Come on --What is it?What? The CAMERA PASSES Jerry's bedroom window, catching a glimpse of Peter on the balcony just as he replies to Charley.Yes. Amy begins POUNDING AT THE ATTIC DOOR. above again. The two men look up as it begins to splinter.Well, now we know what he did with the mirrors -- The DOOR to the stairway- CREAKS open behind them, lost somewhere in the dark. Peter whirls, looking back the way they just came.But Charley has disappeared into the darkness before Peter can stop him. Charley appears down the row of antiques, stopping at the foot of the stairs and staring up at.the basement door above. It is partially open, allowing just a sliver of light into the darkness. He calls out, clutching his stake nervously.Who's there -- Amy appears out of the darkness behind him, slowly. approaching; her face deathly white, her lips blood red, her eyes almost glowing in the dark. He hears her at the last second, whirling to face her with a gasp. She reads the fear on his face and smiles sadly, reaching out a hand to him.Get it open! She suddenly leaps for him, .stabbing with the stake only to miss him by inches, sending it plunging through the back of a chair with her growing strength, shattering it against the stone wall behind the chair. She turns on Charley, empty-handed now, continuing.to stalk him. Before-the dais, Peter stifles his revulsion of the rats and leaps forward, rushing to the side of the coffin and fumbling with the clasps only to discover they're locked. he cries out again..No, nothing. He jumps into bed with her,, the two of them beginning to make- love as the CAMERA PANS off them to the window, pushing out through the window closing in on Jerry's window across the way. A pair of red eyes stand there in the darkness, staring and staring as the CAMERA MOVES CLOSER AND CLOSER. They blink; . they're for real; there is another vampire out there and he is watching Charley.", "clean_line": "forget peter vincent love station break segues commercial bunch kids singing dancing

Right here it says the divorce rate is 76% higher among couples who don't argue before marriage.Oh, yes, that's right. Well it never hurts to-plan ahead.Good night, Amy. And thanks for helping Charley.Charley, that wasn't very nice, not walking Amy to the front door.Oh, the new owner must.be moving in.I.d.on't know. Some fellow who fikes up houses, he said.

With my luck, he's probably gay.Why, what do you know that I- don't?Study? You?(staring up as her sonOh, Charley, I have to be at work atCharley! Dandrig.e and Billy Cole freeze, both of them turning to look at the back door to the Brewster house, inadvertently staring right at the clump of bushes where Charley.is hid .ing. Dandrige takes a step forward, his eyes probing the dark- ness as though he can actually see through the murky black- ness right to where Charley hides. Terrified, Charley suddenly leaps to his feet and races back into his own yard, disappearing through the back door with his mother. Billy steps forward as though to follow the boy. Jerry puts out a restraining hand, stopping him.Here, drink this..Charley, how late did you stay up studying?What?.(.staring at himCharley, come down here, please. There's someone I want you to meet. He turns and walks out of the room, feeling better now.Charley, this is.our next door neighbor, Jerry Dandrige. Charley freezes. Jerry Dandrige sits in the best chair, a drink in his hand, smiling at Charley. He's even better looking close up, almost blindingly beautiful, too much so actually. There's something disturbing about it, as though such good looks have to cover up an inner putrefaction, some sort of hidden, sweet, sickly rot just beneath the perfect pale skin. He rises, the smile widening as he sees the terror in Charley's eyes. He holds his hand out as Judy watches her son for his reaction.Well, shake hands, Charley. There's no reason to be rude. Charley slowly crosses to Jerry and takes his hand, shaking it as one would the hand of a recently disinterred corpse.

It's dinner time.Why?Oh, shit, Brewster, you're certifiable, you know that..Let's cut through here.Look, Brewster, vampires don't exist. Haven't you gotten that through your thick head yet?Aw, fuck you, Brewster. He takes a step toward the alley. Charley grabs him.Forget it. You may be chickenshit, but I'm not. He disappears down the alley into the darkness. Amy and Charley stare after him. She turns to Charley.He got me, Charley. He bit me. (grabbing him byGive you a hickey! He suddenly lets Charley go, rolling on the pavement and laughing like a maniac, perfectly all tight. Charley springs to his feet, furious with him.Ha, hah, really fooled you. (climbing to his feet and dustingCharley, Amy, that you? He hears nothing but those FOOTSTEPS GETTING CLOSER.and CLOSER. The fear starts to work at him, twisting up his gut and making his forehead sheen with sweat. He steps forward, yelling out with false bravery.If that's. you, it isn't working. I'm not scared! And then Jerry emerges out of the shadows, smiling at him. With a scream, Evil Ed turns and runs.No, no -- The FOOTSTEPS SUDDENLY STOP. Nothing but silence. The seconds tick past. He takes a step away from the wall, peering into the darkness with something like hope, preying that maybe, just maybe, Dandrige has given up. A voice suddenly whispers in his ear, no more than an inch away.Me, Evil Ed.There's a vampire out here. Let me in. Peter slips the cross into his pocket and unlocks the door. Be pulls Evil Ed into the room, hurriedly locking and bar- ring the door behind him. Evil Ed has changed, and not for the better. His skin is more sallow, huge dark circles under his eyes, his lips bloodless, his collar pulled up tightly around his neck. Peter turns to him.What are you going to do, not me. Peter stares at him as Evil Ed slowly reaches up and pulls down the collar of his shirt, revealing two small puncture marks on his throat. Peter's eyes widen in horror; Evil Ed's smile only grows wider.I used to admire you, you know that. Of course, that was before I found out what \u00e2\u0080\u00a2a fake you were.Peter Vincent, the great vampire killer, indeed! He throws himself at Peter, grabbing him from behind and whirling him about, opening his mouth wide to sink his fangs into him. Peter straightens, grabbing the cross from his pocket and thrusting it directly into Evil Ed's face, slamming it into his forehead between his eyes. His skin sizzles and cracks, smoke rising, and Evil Ed backs away, bent over screaming in pain, his hands held to his face. He slowly looks up as Peter watches, frozen in horror. Evil Ed drops his hands from his face, revealing a smoking sign of the cross branded into his forehead. He stares at Peter.What have you done to me? He turns to look into the wall mirror, but there's no re- flection.for him to see. He whirls on Peter, screaming at him like the spoiled brat he is.What have you done to me? He takes a step toward Peter and Peter thrusts the cross at him.The master will kill you for \u00e2\u0080\u00a2this. And not fast, slowly, oh, so slowly -- Peter advances on him, the cross held out in front of him with shaking hands, backing Evil Ed across the room toward the window.I know. I did it. He grins up at Peter as he.-slowly rises, the wig slipping from his head, his features already transformed subtly into those of a vampire, the hair slicked back on his head, his face elongated, two huge white fangs slashing over his lower lip. Peter staggers back, staring at him in horror.She's working nights apparently. She left - a note for Charley.

Billy one-hands it out of the air, turning back for the Jeep. Just then the back door to Charley's house bangs open, sending a shaft of light into the darkness. Judy Brewster stands there in the doorway, calling to her son.Hello, Charley. Charley just stares at him.What's wrong, Charley? Afraid I'd never come over without being invited first? You're quite right. But, of course, now that I've been made welcome, I'll probably drop by quite a bit. His voice changes, suddenly charged with double meaning, his eyes burning into Charley.In fact, anytime I feel like it. With your mother's kind permission, of course.Nice meeting you, Charley. (his voice suddenly dripping with doubleNow we wouldn't want to wake your mother, would we, Charley?You deserve to die, boy And he. begins to slowly choke Charley, suddenly stopping, staring into the boy's face.Of course, I could give you something I've never had... a choice. You forget abotrt me and I'll forget about you. What do you say, Charley?I know you're there, Charley, I can see you. Charley slowly turns, staring out his window. There, in the window of the house next door,. stands Jerry Dandrige, the phone to his ear, staring at Charley.I just destroyed your car, Charley. But-it's nothing compared to what I'm going to do to you tomorrow night. Be hangs up, slowly reaching out and drawing the shade.Yes.Yes, that sounds fine. Only don't come over till six tomorrow.It seems we won't have to go out tonight after all. His friends are bringing him over tomorrow night.Ah, Mr. Vincent. (shaking Peter's handAnd who might these two attractive people be?Charmed. Isn't that what vampires are supposed to do, Charley? Charley scowls at him. The others laugh. Jerry turns to the living room.Please, come in -- Be ushers Peter into the living room, Billy following. Amy and Evil Ed stare after Jerry, both totally captivated.Are you sure that's holy water, Mr. Vincent?There, satisfied?And you're finally-convinced I'm not a vampire either,-correct? Their eyes lock; a moment passes. Then finally:Well, I'm glad that's all.settled.I can't tell you how much I. appreciate this, Mr. Vincent. You've been a great help.It's been very nice meeting both of you. Please, feel free to drop by anytime. You'll always be welcome.Please, call me Jerry. Her face is beginning to stiffen, her eyes turning blank. Charley looks at her in sudden alarm, remembering the girl he saw through the window that night. He grabs Amy by the arm, tugging. her toward the door.The same goes for you,.Ed I suspect we have many of the same interests. You know, in such things as horror movies and the occult. Peter's head jerks up and he looks at the doorway. Now he sees Jerry standing there, talking to the kids. PeterSomething wrong, Mr. Vincent? Peter hurriedly scoops up the case, trying to hide his shaking hands and keep the tremor out of his voice.I could teach her so much --Nothing. Jerry turns away from the window, sits at the foot of the stairs.No?Hello, .Edward. Evil Ed turns with a scream to find Jerry standing right next to him. Almost insane with fear now, slobbering like a wounded animal, he backs away from the shadowy figure, hitting the corner and sliding to the cold pavement, almost curled up in a fetal ball, tears streaming from his eyes. Dandrige walks over to him, staring down with something like pity in his eyes.You have nothing to fear from me. I understand what it's like, being different. Only they won't make fun of you anymore or beat you up. I'll see to that. All you have to do is take my hand. Evil Ed slowly looks up at him through his tear-stained eyes to see Jerry staring-down at him, his. hand outstretch- ed to.him, a slight smile on his face, gentle, seductive, beguiling.Here, Edward, take my hand. Evil Ed looks down at the hand outstretched to him.(a growl of inhumanWhat is that?Fool! He slams him back into the seat with so much force the crossbar that holds it in'place.bends.What's wrong, Charley? Jealous? He grinds his pelvis against.Amy, dry humping her in front of Charley. She throws her head back, her mouth opening in .something close to ecstasy, her eyes glazed, staring up at him with adoration, giving herself to him as she cocks her head to one side, exposing her tender young throat. Charley goes crazy.I don't want to kill you, Charley. I -want you to bring Peter Vincent to my house, just the two of you. That is if you ever want to see Amy again. He casually releases Charley, letting the boy drop to the floor as he disappears with Amy into the swirling mass of dancers. Charley leaps to his feet, ignoring the pain in his hand and plunges after them. Charley breaks free of the swirl near the bar, looking everywhere and not seeing either of them. Suddenly he's grabbed by a strong, pair of arms. He looks up to find himself staring into the face of a huge, black BOUNCER.She's mine -- Donny puts out his hand, stopping Jerry as the black bouncer drag's Charley and Amy toward the front door.Where you wanted to be. In bedroom. He reaches out a hand to her; she cowers back.You don't really care. He hits play on the TAPE DECK. FUNK ROCK, hot and driving, snakes out of the speakers. He turns back to her, holding out his hand. She looks away, then glances up only to find herself trapped in his gaze. He starts.to weave his way across the floor toward her,. every move a suggestion, an invitation, all of it somehow hypnotic. She stares at him, fighting to break free. Finally she manages to turn her head away, staring at the floor, screaming at him.Am I lying, Amy? He stops above her, leaning down, his voice a husky, post- coital whisper.Am I? And she's gone, his eyes drawing her in and swallowing her up, drowning her in their faint red glow. He holds out his hand to her. She slowly takes it and-he raises her up into his arms, moving in place to the MUSIC with her, smiling down as she stares up at him blindly. He gently pushes her head down on his shoulder, exposing her tender young neck. And then he slowly bends down, his mouth opening to expose those two, razor sharp fangs with their alabaster cast, slowly, delicately sliding them beneath her skin.Oh, really? He reaches out, takes the cross. from Peter's hand and crumples it, contemptuously tossing. it aside. Be turns back to Peter.You have to have faith in order for it to work on me, Mr. Vincent. He starts down the stairs again, Peter backing away, terrified, his nerve completely gone now. Charley steps forward, staring up at Dandrige defiantly. He whips out his cross, thrusting it at the vampire.You wanted her, there she is. Charley glances to his side, sees Amy lying there, and crawls to her. He gently turns her toward'him.You see, you gave me so much trouble, I thought you deserved a special punishment.Here. (Charley stares atI think she just opened her eyes.Yes. We have a visitor. He puts down his shovel, heading for the stairs, Billy following him.Do you? He steps back into Amy's room, disappearing from sight. Peter looks at Charley.Amy, awake, I command you to awake!So. Just the two of us at last.No! Peter picks up his stake and dives for the vampire, Dandrige is too quick for him. He throws himself off the landing, tucking his body into a somersault as he hurls through the air toward the portico floor below, turning into a whirling ball of spinning flesh only to suddenly emerge- from it no longer a man, but now an enormous bat. The' bat straightens in midair above the portico and zooms down the hallway, smashing into Charley chest high, blowing him off his feet as his claws rake the boy, sending two bloody furrows down his chest as the bat whips past him and disappears down the hallway into the darkness.", "clean_line": "forgot billy hands air turning jeep door charley house bangs open sending shaft light darkness judy brewster stands doorway calling son hello charley charley stares wrong charley afraid come invited right course ve welcome ll probably drop bit voice changes suddenly charged double meaning eyes burning charley fact anytime feel like mother kind permission course nice meeting charley voice suddenly dripping doublenow wouldn want wake mother charley deserve die boy begins slowly choke charley suddenly stopping staring boy face course ve choice forget abotrt ll forget charley know charley charley slowly turns staring window window house door stands jerry dandrige phone ear staring charley destroyed car charley compared going tomorrow night hangs slowly reaching drawing shade yes yes sounds fine come till tomorrow won tonight friends bringing tomorrow night ah mr vincent shaking peter handand attractive people charmed isn vampires supposed charley charley scowls laugh jerry turns living room come ushers peter living room billy following amy evil ed stare jerry totally captivated sure holy water mr vincent satisfied finally convinced vampire correct eyes lock moment passes finally glad settled tell appreciate mr vincent ve great help nice meeting feel free drop anytime ll welcome jerry face beginning stiffen eyes turning blank charley looks sudden alarm remembering girl saw window night grabs amy arm tugging door goes ed suspect interests know things horror movies occult peter head jerks looks doorway sees jerry standing talking kids petersomething wrong mr vincent peter hurriedly scoops case trying hide shaking hands tremor voice teach jerry turns away window sits foot stairs hello edward evil ed turns scream jerry standing right insane fear slobbering like wounded animal backs away shadowy figure hitting corner sliding cold pavement curled fetal ball tears streaming eyes dandrige walks staring like pity eyes fear understand like different won fun anymore beat ll hand evil ed slowly looks tear stained eyes jerry staring hand outstretch ed slight smile face gentle seductive beguiling edward hand evil ed looks hand outstretched growl inhumanwhat fool slams seat force crossbar holds place bends wrong charley jealous grinds pelvis amy dry humping charley throws head mouth opening close ecstasy eyes glazed staring adoration giving cocks head exposing tender young throat charley goes crazy want kill charley want bring peter vincent house want amy casually releases charley letting boy drop floor disappears amy swirling mass dancers charley leaps feet ignoring pain hand plunges charley breaks free swirl near bar looking seeing suddenly grabbed strong pair arms looks staring face huge black bouncer donny puts hand stopping jerry black bouncer drag charley amy door wanted bedroom reaches hand cowers care hits play tape deck funk rock hot driving snakes speakers turns holding hand looks away glances trapped gaze starts weave way floor suggestion invitation hypnotic stares fighting break free finally manages turn head away staring floor screaming lying amy stops leaning voice husky post coital whisper gone eyes drawing swallowing drowning faint red glow holds hand slowly takes raises arms moving place music smiling stares blindly gently pushes head shoulder exposing tender young neck slowly bends mouth opening expose razor sharp fangs alabaster cast slowly delicately sliding beneath skin oh reaches takes cross peter hand crumples contemptuously tossing aside turns peter faith order work mr vincent starts stairs peter backing away terrified nerve completely gone charley steps forward staring dandrige defiantly whips cross thrusting vampire wanted charley glances sees amy lying crawls gently turns gave trouble thought deserved special punishment charley stares ati think opened eyes yes visitor puts shovel heading stairs billy following steps amy room disappearing sight peter looks charley amy awake command awake peter picks stake dives vampire dandrige quick throws landing tucking body somersault hurls air portico floor turning whirling ball spinning flesh suddenly emerge longer man enormous bat bat straightens midair portico zooms hallway smashing charley chest high blowing feet claws rake boy sending bloody furrows chest bat whips past disappears hallway darkness"}}}
