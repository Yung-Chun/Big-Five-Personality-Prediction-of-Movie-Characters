What we should do, though, is put those peanut barrels to use. Fill 'em with booze and line up some planks. If the walls come down... we hit 'em Donkey Kong style.Next time, look within.

SOMEBODY!GET DOWN!Goddamn you!The jungle has a new king.My husband...He's dead.Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. One went through three of your patrons like nothing.He only shot you once.He shot you the other time.That's one piece of four problems.That head over there, that's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.The next one is taller, but all out of proportion. Like a \"teen beast.\"He was spastic, clumsy, but deadly just the same.I just took the eye out of the mother. She calculates, guiding the attacks.If you are face to face with her, dive left.Father. The biggest, the strongest...No sign of any weaknesses. No sign at all. He's an eating machine.That's not it. Four are here, but there's three others... which I can't account for.We need to lock this place down. Is everyone in this room?Wait!Stop her!Let's lock off this room.Damn it.Just let her be... please. Is that the only phone?I wouldn't do that.You can risk your life, but not mine! My daughter's no more than twenty miles from here waiting for me. I have just as much reason to leave this place as you do. But I also know that if they're here, then they're not there yet.You understand me?You understand me!?Now pull that tough boy shit again and I'll slice you from neck to nuts!We can't risk letting them in.My daughter's in Red Mountain.Oh no.Keep it together! I came from the east. That studio is south of here. For all we know, north and west are okay.So, that leaves the west.Right.Let's work.We have to kill it. Can you help?Aim for their orifices. Eyes, ears and mouth. From what I've seen, it's their only weakness.What are you doing?Get back!Well, it all started about forty hours ago...So, how is staying with Grandma working out? Ya know, if you stare into her glasses, you can see what cards she is holding. But I didn't tell you that.Mommy will pick you up tomorrow night, okay baby?Hello? Charlie?We barricaded ourselves in the cellar. Then it was just listening. We heard those things destroy an entire heard of livestock. They just kept coming. Closer and closer, consuming anything in the way. Slashing, feeding and licking the bones clean. Just when we said our prayers, the first ray of sun hit the house...That first beam of sunlight drove 'em away. Somewhere. We called who we could and then decided to run for it. We didn't see a soul the whole drive out. When the tank went dry, we came upon a gas station to refill.They've been here!We had no time. All we knew was the sun was dropping and we had to get enough fuel to make it through the night at 90 miles per hour...It happened fast...That's when I saw three others... just for a second.Close the roof!It must have smelled the blood or something. We buried the body and got back on the main road when...And that's how I ended up here.I don't want to talk about that.No. It was wild out there. No time to think. We just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.It appears so.Yeah.As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.We learned fast.Fine.Relax, they don't know anything.East. Why?Previous owners did, I think.Careful.Everyone stay in the middle of the room! Off the walls! NOW!Now, does everyone agree that they are still out there?'Eh, Chief?No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.Alright, we need to stay alert and for everyone to take a role. You gotta have some guns or weapons around here.Okay, well that's something.Alright, what else do we have? Can we somehow contact the outside world?You said you had a short wave radio.Good. I'm heading to the basement for supplies. And you're going upstairs.Step up, Chief.No. You're locked in.Those two will be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food, I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things.Any volunteers to head into the basement with me?Alright.What's this?Let's get everything upstairs.I'm sorry.I admire your strength.This is my daughter, Charlie. She's all I'm after.And I'm gonna need your strength, every bit of it.Good. But still do me a favor.Don't tell anyone I have a soft side.Move it!I told you to stay in the main room.We know what not to do. We must stay focused and together. The beasts will find a breach. We gotta find a way out before they find a way in.What?You know what.You. What was that door downstairs?Don't bullshit me.What's it for?What's it for!?Does the tunnel spit out near a car?It's a shot. Is it gassed up?Four door?How many can it hold?Max?It's gonna fit thirteen.Keys.Three of us go. Two to defend, one to drive. We back up to the bar and then tear ass out of here.Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die.Hey! I'm not trusting him either, that's why I'm going with.This is it. They have this place surrounded, but if we go under them we might just make it.The rest of you prepare the weapons, whatever you got left. 'Cause when we crash through those walls, we're bringin' death with us.Neither. Just a farmer.I just think about my husband and daughter... and the rest is easy.Easy.Let's go.Quiet.Move.Go! The bitch is mine!Look out!You fuck with my family. I fuck right back!Oh shit.Send it up! Send it up!Move it! Move it! Move it!Goddamn it!I'M ALIVE! OPEN THE DOOR!F-f-fuck you.I think they made it.Stop trying to get people killed. It is getting very old.What's this?I need some shells.Let's prepare ourselves, they ought to be here with the truck any minute.That's your choice, but this is going to get a whole lot worse before it gets any better.Get on the tables!!! On the tables!!!Settle down!What's Plan B?Now!Help me!Come on!Do something!!!Come on, I'll help you.I'm not leaving anyone behind.She's still out here.Stay put.Where are you... come on...Come on! Come on!Come and get me you blood-chugging CUNT!Not for long, we gotta burn it.Come on! Let's blow this thing!Here we go...She's calling for help.Get to your cars!!!I don't know, I think --We're safe until dark, but we need to find other people.You know where the IGA grocery store is over in Red Mountain?They have a bomb shelter.We'll meet in three hours?We're going to get my little girl.Oh no...It's right up there, in the back of the store.Where is everyone?She's supposed to already be here.This place is a ghost town.Charlie?Charlie!Honey!?I love you...You're not safe, she's still alive, she'll be back...Where are you taking us?", "clean_line": "help somebody goddamn jungle new king husband dead easy surrounded likes seen kind animals real fast volatile predators went patrons like shot shot time piece problems head oldest bunch looked like grandpa caught little junior cooler ve seen lacks size makes speed unfortunately worst em outside taller proportion like teen beast spastic clumsy deadly took eye mother calculates guiding attacks face face dive left father biggest strongest sign weaknesses sign eating machine account need lock place room wait stop let lock room damn let phone wouldn risk life daughter miles waiting reason leave place know understand understand pull tough boy shit ll slice neck nuts risk letting daughter red mountain oh came east studio south know north west okay leaves west right let work kill help aim orifices eyes ears mouth ve seen weakness started hours ago staying grandma working ya know stare glasses cards holding tell mommy pick tomorrow night okay baby hello charlie barricaded cellar listening heard things destroy entire heard livestock kept coming closer closer consuming way slashing feeding licking bones clean said prayers ray sun hit house beam sunlight drove em away called decided run soul drive tank went dry came gas station refill ve time knew sun dropping fuel night miles hour happened fast saw second close roof smelled blood buried body got main road ended want talk wild time think moved leave ran appears yeah long dark hide wait drop guard attack learned fast fine relax know east previous owners think careful stay middle room walls agree eh chief goes unarmed alright need stay alert role gotta guns weapons okay alright contact outside world said short wave radio good heading basement supplies going upstairs step chief locked waiting food want set keys belly things volunteers head basement alright let upstairs sorry admire strength daughter charlie gonna need strength bit good favor tell soft told stay main room know stay focused beasts breach gotta way way know door downstairs bullshit tunnel spit near car shot gassed door hold max gonna fit thirteen keys defend drive bar tear ass let clear stay die hey trusting going place surrounded rest prepare weapons got left cause crash walls bringin death farmer think husband daughter rest easy easy let quiet bitch look fuck family fuck right oh shit send send goddamn alive open door fuck think stop trying people killed getting old need shells let prepare ought truck minute choice going lot worse gets better tables tables settle plan help come come ll help leaving stay come come come come blood chugging cunt long gotta burn come let blow thing calling help cars know think safe dark need people know iga grocery store red mountain bomb shelter ll meet hours going little girl oh right store supposed place ghost town charlie charlie honey love safe alive ll taking"}}}
