{"Bull-Durham": {"ANNIE": {"raw_line": "I believe in the Church of Baseball. I've tried all the major religions and most of the minor ones -- I've worshipped Buddha, Allah, Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, trees, mushrooms, and Isadora Duncan...I know things. For instance -- There are 108 beads in a Catholic rosary. And -- There are 108 stitches in a baseball. When I learned that, I gave Jesus a chance. But it just didn't work out between us. The Lord laid too much guilt on me. I prefer metaphysics to theology. You see, there's no guilt in baseball... and it's never boring.Which makes it like sex. There's never been a ballplayer slept with me who didn't have the best year of his career. Making love is like hitting a baseball -- you just got to relax and concentrate.Besides, I'd never sleep with a player hitting under .250 unless he had a lot of R.B.I.'s or was a great glove man up the middle. A woman's got to have standards.The young players start off full of enthusiasm and energy but they don't realize that come July and August when the weather is hot it's hard to perform at your peak level. The veterans pace themselves better. They finish stronger. They're great in September. While I don't believe a woman needs a man to be fulfilled, I do confess an interest in finding the ultimate guy -- he'd have that youthful exuberance but the veteran's sense of timing...Y'see there's a certain amount of \"life-wisdom\" I give these boys. I can expand their minds. Sometimes when I've got a ballplayer alone I'll just read Emily Dickinson or Walt Whitman to him. The guys are so sweet -- they always stay and listen. Of course a guy will listen to anything if he thinks it's foreplay.I make then feel confident. They make me feel safe. And pretty.What I give them lasts a life-time. What they give me lasts 142 games. Sometimes it seems like a bad trade. But bad trades are part of baseball -- who can forget Frank Robinson or Milt Pappas, for Godsakes! It's a long season and you got to trust it.I've tried them all -- I really have -- and the only church that truly feeds the soul -- day in, day out -- is the Church of Baseball.Number twenty-two's thighs are just great. Who's he?Three-fourteen? Hmmm... Look't those thighs, Jackson.-- Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse. It'll just get everybody in trouble.You didn't get \"lured\". Women never get lured. They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it -- \"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions\".That's better. Got the radar ready?He looks great, just great!Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.It says he's not bending his back on his follow-through.Well let's get down to it, honey -- how was he?What a sweet idea --We didn't order this, honey...Who's that?Really? Kinda cute...Annie Savoy. Wanta dance?I don't trust a man who don't dance. It ain't natural.All of 'em, I think...You got a live arm there.You need a nickname.Crash, I didn't think you --You boys gonna fight over little me?Oh don't be such guys --Hell, Max, wanta dance?Well -- you boys stopped fighting yet? Are you pals now? Good. I love a little macho male bonding -- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being \"re- channeled\" but I believe in \"re- channeling\" so who cares, right? Shall we go to my place?Oh both of you, of course...These are the ground rules. I hook up with one guy a season -- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy -- kinda my own spring training... And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far. So... I thought we should get to know each other.Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction. There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey -- slow down.What do you believe in?Oh my... Don't leave...Wait, Crash -- don't go -- all I want is a date. I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.I'm not interested yet.No ballplayer ever said \"no\" to a date with me.Wait, honey, slow down -- I want to watch.No, no, no. Put it back on and take it off slowly.When you know how to make love, you'll know how to pitch. Shh. I love this part.Oh my -- what a nice back.No, no, honey... first the shoes and socks.You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?Ebby honey have you ever been handcuffed in bed?Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.Good -- then listen. \"I sing the body electric. The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them -- \"Shh, shh... \"They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, and discorrupt them and charge them\"\"Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous -- quivering jelly of love, white blow and delirious juice --What'd he say?Oh my...See my hips?I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.But you were pulling your hips last night.I'm committed to Nuke for the season. You had your chance the other night.Young men are uncomplicated. And he's not \"dim\". He's just inexperienced. My job is to give him \"life-wisdom\" and help him make it to the major leagues.Damn.But they're nice hips. I looked up your records -- You've hit 227 home runs in the minors. That's great!Why not? If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ! The record's...Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.Damn.Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao- Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.Oh Crash... you do make speeches...You got me all confused.I'm not a real batter. I'm a woman.It's a long season, boys.Yes, yes, yesnmmmmyes... Oh my... Oh, that was just fabulous, Crash.I didn't say \"Crash\". I said Nuke.Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?You see how nice things are when we go slow?You can learn to like it.Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever. Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie -- now get some rest for tonight's game.Oh dear... easy honey...Here we go again, Jackson, hold on tight...I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently -- plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain. These'll help move things to the right side.They did when they were in the Carolina League.A woman should never ask questions about road trips.Men don't realize that women always know when they've been unfaithful. The fact is, upon exact moment of penetration -- the woman knows.This sort of spiritual awareness can be a mixed blessing, especially if you're dating a ballplayer. I believe a woman oughta take care of her man so thoroughly that he can go on the road for a few days without having the desire to search out another pair of panties That is probably, however, my most ridiculous belief. I just hope the boys start winning soon. In some profound way I fear that a last place team is a reflection on its women...What is this \"I, I, I\" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me? Don't I look nice?Good. Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous. Let's play catch.That's not necessary, Jackson -- Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.Just do what I say. Now, which nostril are you breathing through?The right nostril. Good.There are two important psychic conduits called the \"pingala\" and the \"ida\". The pingala starts with the left testicle and ends at the right nostril.The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball. And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.Right. Okay, fire a couple in there.You're patronizing me! I will not be patronized --He's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six.A little better.Much better. Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me. This is progress.Or... ...We could just take that sexual energy and save it for a few hours and re-channel it into your pitching tonight. C'mon, Jackson, I've got some lemonade!It's all the same thing.That's Max. His ashes anyway. He left no kin...Oh don't be silly. Death is nothing to be scared of. It's just another way of living. It's just a fresh start -- kinda like spring training.Yes. And so is birth. Now look me in the eyes, Nuke -- You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?He looks wonderful, Jackson...Oh my...Oh no -- he's shaking off the sign, Jackson. Big mistake...I'm yours.Breathing through your pingala always works, honey --Now don't go overboard, I look incredibly hot, right?Nuke?!Get over here.Ebby Calvin \"Nuke\" LaLoosh --Nuke was so encouraged that he took a vow to not have sex until they lost...Y'see a ballplayer on a streak considers himself touched with magic and he'll do anything to keep from breaking the spell...In fact the whole team started making religious connections and everybody got hot.I figured Nuke would win a couple, then lose, and things would get back to normal...But it didn't happen like that... and for one extraordinary June and July, the Durham Bulls, for whatever perverse reason, began playing baseball with joy and verve and poetry --The two sides of my own brain were all jumbled up and cross-wired... while one side was being neglected, the other was in paradise watching our Bulls play like Big Leaguers...We swept a four game series with Kingston, back to back doubleheaders with Winston-Salem, and kicked the holy shit out of Greensboro in a three game series...They were in demand all over town -- and Crash, who kept hitting dingers, was approaching the minor league record... though I told nobody.After sweeping a July 4 doubleheader, the Durham Bulls were tied for first.But beautiful as the winning streak was, I was getting damn lonely. Something had to be done. I needed a man...I'm so proud of you and all the guys. Want some more soup?How 'bout a back rub?I'll tuck you in.I'm not gonna try to seduce you, sweetie...That's my leg.I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love.Sure. Unsnap my stockings.Yes I do...What a nasty thing to say.Oh... Crash is a very smart man. Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.Watch... one hand --Now you try.Mmmmmmm... oh yes...I'm trying to play with your body!Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it -- Aren't I pretty?Cute?! I hate cute! Baby ducks are cute! I wanta be exotic and mysterious!Nuke! You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball. Ask Crash.What'd he say?He did?Crash... I want you.He's confused --Don't you think I'm pretty?I want to be had.He won't make love to me anymore.I want you desperately!I teach part time at the Junior College. What if I told you I was through with Nuke? He learned his lessons quickly and left me.I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.I'm ready for a complicated man.I said when I think about you, I get wet.God damn you -- what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me? This is the weirdest season I ever saw -- the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!I need a drink.I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5 -- born again before kindergarten... by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...pregnant, had an abortion, got pregnant again, had an abortion again... gave up men. Tried women. Missed men. My mother died. I bought a car for $200 and drove to Ft. Lauderdale to bury her. And after we'd sung some hymns in some wretched Florida funeral home, I went outside and something happened --The smell of cut grass in the warm March air overwhelmed me and I heard a noise -- ) -- tok, tok, tok -- and some men shouting... then tok, tok, tok.I crossed the street -- it was the New York Yankees spring training field -- tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat -- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother... And I saw him.Thurman Munson. He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody -- it was beautiful... And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition! So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else -- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home. Don't you see? If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is!It's true, It's true! Least it used to be true. It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?No.Well... I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to. Lately I'm not so sure.Whatta you mean \"why not\"? Are you gonna play forever?!Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.Oh Jimmy, honey, I think it sounds wonderful!No, no -- I'm fine. Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?We all deserve to wear white.God, he's so romantic...When Crash got throwed out, the game got out of hand... ...Jose made three errors with his cursed mitt...Nuke never quite got in the groove though he didn't pitch bad......and the winning streak came to an end with a 3-2 loss... The good news was that a man was about to come calling... the bad news was -- it was the wrong guy.It's okay...Oh -- won't YOU come in?Uh oh... Can I offer you some coffee?He's a good student.Praise the Lord, eh?Oh my -- I better fix that. Ebby will you help me? I'm no good with mechanical thingsYou don't have to...So am I. Nuke, honey, we need to talk ---- but you're father's in there!Nuke -- we do need to talk!Hello? Skip? Yeah, as a matter of fact, he is here.It's Skip, for you.Oh let's not...That's great!Just pitch well and do good.She will, Mr. LaLoosh, she will...Well I guess this is it.Neither will I.Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh -- don't think too much.I heard already.Oh my......so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?It doesn't work like that. God, you're gorgeous. Want to dance?...mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth, jaws, and the jaw hinges...Crash said he had to get an early start to drive to Asheville in the South Atlantic League where he heard they might need a catcher to finish out the season...The house smelled like sex for days. It was wonderful. The only real cleaning I did was on the kitchen floor 'cause who likes to walk on spilt cereal?The funny thing is, I stopped worrying about Nuke. Somehow I knew nothing would stop him. Crash was right -- Nuke had a gift.I was reading in bed when Crash hit his 247th home run. I knew the moment it happened...I lit a candle for Crash's dinger... and tried to root the Durham Bulls home to a pennant.The Kid from Lynchburg wasn't good enough to hold Crash's jockstrap if ya ask me, and Nuke's replacement had a fastball that I coulda hit We had a three game lead with two weeks to go when the rains came.It rained and rained and I thought of driving down to Asheville to see Crash but then I thought \"No, what you pursue, eludes you\". I had to trust Quantum Physics and the Church of Baseball. It ain't always easy being this religious...Oh my...What happened?I'm quitting too. Boys, not baseball.Salem, Massachusetts? Where all the witches were?Not yet. It takes years of practice...You'd be great, just great... 'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an' all -- but the fact is that there's a spacious-\"non-time kind of time\" to it...What?I can do that, too.Walt Whitman once said -- \"I see great things in baseball. It's our game -- the American game He said \"it will repair our losses and be a blessing to us\"...

And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3 -- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.I'm too old for this shit. Why the hell am I back in \"A\" ball?\"Mature\" ain't a fuckin' verb.And where can I go?You don't want a player, you want a stable pony. My Triple A contract gets bought out so I can hold the Flavor o' the Month's dick in the bus leagues?! Fuck this fucking game... I fuckin' quit.Who we play tomorrow?Hopeless. Utterly fucking hopeless.I'm Crash Davis.I don't dance.She's dancing with me.I'll learn. C'mon --Love to --I don't believe in fighting.Take the first shot at me.Hit me in the chest with this...From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshotThrow it. C'mon, right in the chest.C'mon, Meat. You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh. C'mon, Rook -- show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head --Ball four.I'm Crash Davis. Your new catcher. And you just got Lesson Number One -- \"Don't think -- it can only hurt the ballclub\". Buy ya a drink?Shut up -- I like this song... April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...It's a damn easy thing to play with.Why do you get to choose? Why don't I get to choose?After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout. Besides -- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart... or loins.I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap. I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the \"sweet spot\", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.G'night.I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.See ya at the yard, Meat.Your shower shoes have fungus on 'em. You'll never get to the Bigs with fungus on your shower shoes. Think classy and you'll be classy. If you win 20 in the Show you can let the fungus grow back on your shower shoes and the press'll think you're colorful. Until you win twenty in the Show, however, it means you're a slob.He ain't got shit.You ain't getting that cheese by me, meat.Look for the fastball up. He's gotta come with the cheese. Relax. Relax. Quick bat. Pop the clubhead. Open the hips. Relax. You're thinking too much. Get outta your fuckin' head, Crash.Get on top of the ball. Quick bat. Don't let him in your kitchen --You stupid fuck, Crash. What're you swinging at a breaking ball for? Why's he starting me off with a hammer? Fuck me. You're okay. Stay back. Stay back, you dumb fuck. Wait. Wait.Throw that shit again, meat. Throw that weak ass shit. Now he's gotta try to slip the cheese by me. One and one. You're on top. Now bring me the gas --This son of a bitch throws hard. Annie, Annie, Annie -- who is this Annie? Jesus, get outta the box you idiot, where's your head? Get the broad outta your head.Time out.Shut up.Awright, awright. You've seen all his pitches. Two and one. Relax. Wait. Quick bat. You can hit this shit --Shorten up. Bring the gas... Be quick -- be quick -- yeah, yeah...He ain't got shit.Read it.Yep.When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting. But you shouldn't think about it too much. The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.So... Wanta make love?What'you see in that guy -- he's dim, pretty boy. A young, wild...That's my job too.You're pulling your hips out.Don't tell anybody.247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.No. Please.Let me.Your place or mine?Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause it might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around -- Great deal. You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing -- So what do you really want? You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic? Or do you want a guy?Well, Annie, your place or mine?A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing --Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that? Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin \"Nuke\" LaLoosh.See you guys at the ballpark.Drive off your back leg. You pitch with your legs as much as your arms --Don't think.Don't try to strike everybody out. Strikeouts are boring. They're Fascist. Throw some ground balls, it's more Democratic.And listen, meat. You don't know shit. If you want to get to the Show, you'll listen to me. She only wants you 'cause she can boss you around, got it? Relax, have a ball out here. This game's fun, okay? Fun, God damn it. And don't squeeze the ball so tight. It's an egg. Hold it like an egg.Shake off the pitch. Throw what you wanta.Why you shaking me off?\"To announce your fucking presence with authority\"? This guy's a first ball fastball hitter. He's looking for heat.Awright, meat, give him your heat.Fastball.What're you lookin' at?! You're showing up my pitcher, bush -- get your ass in gear!Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?An' he scrambled the son of a bitch. Having fun yet?He did know.I told him.I don't know. I haven't caught anything yet.Have some fun, God damn it.Gimme that.I hate people who get the words wrong. It ain't \"woolly\" it's \"weary\" and it nobody's got stress, they're wearing a dress. Listen.Oh she may be weary, Young girls do get weary, Wearing the same old dress...'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game -- and that's my problem. You got a gift.A gift. When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt -- you need a curve ball. In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.Yep.I was in the Show for 21 days, once. It was the greatest 21 days of my life. You never touch your luggage in the show -- somebody else handles your bags. It's great. The ballparks are like cathedrals, the hotels all have room service, the women have long legs and brains -- it's a smorgasbord.Yeah -- and so are the pitchers. They throw ungodly breaking stuff in the Show -- exploding sliders.You could be one of those guys -- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.Yeah, let's go.As I was saying ya hold it like an egg.I can get us a rainout.Hundred bucks says I can get us a rainout tomorrow.Naw...By the dozen. Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies -- I'm through with one night stands.I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries -- and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.Go for it.I won't have to.Party without me.Helluva guy --What?If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.Wake up, it's okay... you're dreaming...I know, I know -- I have that dream all the time. We're almost home.Hot. Very hot...Annie's a smart lady.God's definitely a woman -- but she's no lady.Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging -- in the Show they woulda ripped you.The moment's over. If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown --I dare you to throw me the hammer -- you ain't that stupid...Breaking ball -- you fool!I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters. Trust me.Yep. Next one might be at your head. Hell if I know where the damn thing's going...This son of a bitch is throwing a two hit shutout and he's shaking me off?! Hey Charlie, here comes the deuce.Yep. He really crushed that dinger, didn't he. Musta gone 450 feet... damn...It's time you started working on your interviews.Learn your clich\u00e9s. Study them. Know them. They're your friends.Write this down. \"We gotta play 'em one day at a time.\"Of course. That's the point. \"I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub.\"Write, write -- \"I just wanta give It my best shot and, Good Lord willing, things'll work out.\"Yep. So how's Annie?You outta your mind? If you give in now you might start losing. Never fuck with a winning streak.Come in.Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?Aren't we all?You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you. I had to have you!I think of you and the \"boy\" all the time.And he's right! A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often. You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties -- then you are! And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.Who are you? Do you have a job?And now you wanta teach me?I doubt that.I thought you wanted an \"uncomplicated\" boy?-- and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.Annie, I think you should leave.You okay?Why baseball?Who?What's so great about baseball?I don't know if I'd go that far.It's possible.Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?Why not?What's wrong?Hey, he's just your father, man -- he's as full of shit as anybody.Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.Nuke's scared cause his nostrils are jammed and his old man's here, we need a live rooster to take the curse off Jose's glove, and nobody knows what to get Jimmy and Millie for their wedding present -- there's a whole lotta shit we're trying to deal with --I got him on the knee!God damn It, Jack, he still ain't touched the plate.It was a cocksucking call!No! I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!You spit on me!You're in the wrong business, Jack -- you're Sears-Roebuck material!You want me to call you a cocksucker?!Beg me!Beg me again!You're a cocksucker!But when she does get weary -- Try a little tenderness...You know she's waiting, just anticipating, the things that she'll never possess... While she's there waiting -- Try a little tenderness...Shut up. I'm playing. Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness... But it's all so easy -- Just try a little tenderness...Then go.Let go of me!No, no, Sandy, put it down. Nuke, you know Sandy Grimes? Hit .367 at Louisville in 155.He hit .371 -- C'mon, Nuke -- you and me, let's step outside and settle this.C'mon!God damn it, you fucking virgin prick -- step outside.You fuck!Why are you a fuck? 'Cause you got talent. I got brains. But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year. All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound -- and that's for science and dog meat.Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.Okay, I'll kick your ass there....God damn... I forgot my fucking shoes. Honey, go get my shoes.You know what the difference is between hitting .250 and hitting .300? I got it figured out. Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points. Okay? There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks -- you get one extra flare a week -- just one -- a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail -- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!Come on, Meat...Nuke... tell me something. Did you hit me with your right or your left?Good. Good. That's terrific...If ya get in a fight with some asshole, never hit his with your pitching hand. Ya might get injured. That's another lesson for ya -- now quit fucking around and help me up.Sorry about last night.I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon. D'you understand that?You will. Look, Nuke -- these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile -- don't worry about it. Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat. That's the secret. You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.No. Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!I don't need a crazy woman in my life.It's the best, Nuke... the absolute fucking best.Nuke -- Good luck.Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?I got released.How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous? How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?...wrist and wrist joints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, fore-finger, finger-joints, finger-nail...C'mon, Meat, throw me that weak ass shit -- c'mon, bring the heat, bring it, bring it...I quit. Hit my dinger and hung 'em up.There might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.Yeah... you a witch?You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?Annie --I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em... but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics... I don't wanta think about nothing... I just wanta be.", "clean_line": "player named later crash davis larry hockett recognize cause years ago texas league pitching el paso hitting cleanup shreveport hung curve pitch game th tattooed

What're you guys doing here -- stealing my girl?No prob, kids --Crash?You mean Nuke. You said \"Crash\".You said \"Crash\".You said \"Crash\".Yeah maybe you're right.Mmm, hmmm. You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off. When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life. He likes baseball more than I do...I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...God, I never thought of that.Hello? Dad? This is Ebby. Yeah, I know, I know -- you got the Durham papers yet? Well I been a little wild... These hitters down here are better than the ones in high school... How's Mom? Yeah? Well I am trying hard... I am bending my back... you're not coming down' here to visit just yet, are you? Can I talk to Mom?I thought I was --What's this guy know, eh? If he's so great why's he been in the minors for ten years? And if he's so hot how come Annie wants me instead of him.Fun? What's he know about fun? Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.But he ain't seen my heat --Why's he always call me \"Meat\"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.Well, I held it like an egg.I'm having a blast. God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.How?Don't think. Just throw. Don't think. Just throw.God, that was beautiful. What'd I do?Christ, Skip and Larry are talking about me. Don't get anybody warm in the pen yet. I'm okay. I'm having fun.Don't yank me in the first, man.Aw, shit.Don't pull me, Skip. I'll settle down. I'm okay!I'm trying not to think.What?Jesus, Annie, I don't know --Big League pitchers don't use these.Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...How come you don't like me?What do I got?I ain't pissing nothing away -- I got a Porsche already. A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.You been in the Majors?God damn it I'm sick of you calling me \"Meat\"! You wanta step outside!No. Wait a minute. Calm down, Crash...Teach me how to throw a breaking ball.This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.\"Naw\"? There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?You're through with one night stands?! What do you want?You're weird, man -- I want a ice skater real bad.If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?Hey, guys, pa--rty!How's this?Get your holy ass in Room 401.Hundred dollar fine if you're not in #401 in five.Crash! Skip wants everybody in #401 for a team meeting. Hundred buck fine if ya don't show!God -- what a Big League move.He can't make it. Here's his fine.Can I ask you something?What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?No!I was playing naked.God I'm tired. What a trip I was lousy. I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched -- it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom. I --Sorry. You look great. I'm totally exhausted.Catch?This in ridiculous. I'm a pro.Which nostril am I breathing through?My right nostril?I'm really beat. I need some serious \"z's\" --Switch nostrils?If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.How was that?Gimme the God damn ball!How ya like that?I give up. Let's go inside, make love, and fall asleep till it's time to go to the ballpark.I can't keep up with you. First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher -- now no sex is gonna do it?!What's that?!God... I think I'm gonna be sick --Death is like spring training?Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers. She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.Annie says there's no such thing as straight and gay. We're all sexual creatures to start with, and we get formed into certain roles.When I'm one and six I'll believe anything. Annie also says that God is a woman. You believe that, Crash, you think God's a lady?God, these panties feel great. That don't make me queer, right? Right. Whoo. Breaking ball.I ain't queer. I know I ain't... Fastball.Fastball again? Why's he want the heat -- I just threw heat. Don't think, Meat -- give 'em the gas.God, Annie's got a great ass... How come her panties fit me? That's one of the mysteries of sex I guess...I was great, eh?Can't you let me enjoy the moment?Hey, I'm cruisin', man -- what're you doing out here?!Why?! I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.You're the boss.Bear down, Meat, don't let up. You own these guys. Dad'll love a shutout...No, no -- this guy's looking for heat -- lemme give him the deuce --You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.Not that. I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy. Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter? We better not fuck.Just till I lose.No.I love winning, Crash, you hear me? I love it. Teach me everything.What do I gotta do?Boring.Jesus.\"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out.\"She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy -- maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down. What'ya think?No, no, it was great.No, that's okay. All I need's a little nap.You can't seduce me.What's that?I know what it is.Fundamentals?Crash once called a woman's, uh -- pussy -- y'know how the hair kinda makes a \"V\" shape? --Well -- he calls it the Bermuda Triangle. He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.He didn't mean it nasty. He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do -- especially like that.oh.No! You're playing with my mind!I knew it -- you're seducing me!I think you're real cute.You're exotic and mysterious and cute -- that's why I better leave.I did.He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.I'll be back when we lose.I'm nervous -- my old man's here.Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.I'll take the curse off the son of a bitch!Shit.We lost.I'd like you to meet my father.I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me. I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit... I mean I'm getting it --Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here --Crash says I gotta quit worrying about him -- c'mon, honey, we got a lotta catching up to do --Yeah, Skip, it's me. Jeez... Jeez... God... Jeez...I'm going to the Show. They're sending me up to finish out the season with the Big Club. I'm going to the Show!I gotta leave first thing in the morning.How can I possibly thank you?I will, I will -- C'mon, Dad, I'll dump you off. I gotta find Crash.Where does he go?They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.He goes to a whorehouse every night?I'm looking for somebody.Looking for Crash Davis.I'm Nuke LaLoosh. With the Bulls.Crash. I'm going to the Show.Club's expanding its roster to finish the season --I'm going to the Show.I'm trying to thank you.Settle what?I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you. Let's have a drink and forget this --C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.Why am I a fuck?You're a great catcher.No.I'll take you back to the hotel.Forget it. You ain't worth thanking --My right.What?Ya look like shit.Forget it.No.Fear and ignorance.I know. I just like to see you get all worked up.Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya... She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...Maybe you do. Y'know I'm starting to like this game -- baseball's a helluva good way to make a living.Yeah, thanks for everything.You too...

I'll call.Dad -- if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.If it makes you and mom feel better, go for it. I gotta run --Y'know, I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub.
