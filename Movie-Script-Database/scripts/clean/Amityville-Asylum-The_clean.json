I know I already sent a copy with my application but just in case.Yes, I uh... I've done a lot of them.Oh yes. Yes I know. You'll see I've also worked cleaning a school, so I am used to big areas.Oh yes, yes of course.I know what you mean, yes.It may be strange at first but I actually have some experience inWell... she passed away.Okay.I really admire that and I promise I would not let you down if I was given this job.Oh my God, I'm so sorry!!Look I'm so sorry, I really am!Hello?Hey Nancy.It was a total fucking disaster!I sneezed on the head of the institution.I sneezed on him! It was one of those sneezes that just sneaks up on you, I didn't have time to cover my face. Before you know it he's covered in my snot!Go on, go ahead. You know you want to!Laugh it up, it's gonna be your last chance because I'm not going for any more job interviews! I'm done, I'm always so damn nervous and I just don't make a good first impression.That's just not me Nance. I wouldn't know where to start with flirting or any of that. Christ, if I wore high heels to one of these interviews I'd probably trip over! I'm a clumsy dork!I dunno. Thanks for not disputing that dork remark by the way.I guess I'll have to sign on welfare to make the rent. Long term, maybe I should go back to school. Get better qualified for something.I dunno, I just... it's like I just haven't been able to bring myself to write since ... you know...Maybe.Not really. I just think I'm gonna get myself a nice big tub of ice cream from the freezer and watch some TV.[Smiles] I know but if there's ever a good time for ice cream it's today!Sure. Night.Hello?Really? Oh, I uh... Hi!Um... is this a joke or something?Seriously?Oh my God I... I can't believe it.Oh God, thank you so much!

I don't want to end up burning myself or any furniture!Okay.Okay.Yeah that's fine.Why did you just talk to her?Okay.Yeah I understand.Cleaning crap up isn't the most difficult part?!What's behind it?Sounds ominous.Really? Doctor Mixter didn't mention that.What's that smell?These patients are dangerous?That's horrible.What's her deal?Some strange stories here.Really?Why is he down here?Oh God.I guess not... it's just a lot to take in. I've obviously never been around stuff like this before.I'm not a quitter.Ooh, you made me jump! Should you be out of bed this late?I don't think you should be.I'd love to sweetheart, but it's very late now. I think you better go back to bed.Fuck!!It's okay.Yeah, just hurt that's all!I'll live.Sure.Yeah.Cool. It's funny, I never thought I'd get this job. The interview didn't go well!Really?Cool.Nice tattoo.What does it mean?Like what?Sorry, I didn't mean to pry.Fair enough.Not bad. I ran into a young girl in the hallway earlier. Sweet little girl, she was only about twelve or thirteen. I told her to go back to bed. I guess they don't lock the kids in at night huh?Yeah definitely. She was carrying a teddy bear. She was about thirteen at the most.What?What?You're kidding right?Then who was that girl in the hallway?I'm positive.Did you find her?Yes.Of course.That's strange.Yes.Sorry.What?No problem.Doctor Mixter? Hello?Uh... I was just emptying the garbage.Look I... it was just open and I ... I dunno.Oh please don't, I didn't see anything I just opened it.But I've only just got this job and I really need it.What do you mean?What kind of favour?You're disgusting!Look, you better get out of my way or I'm going to report you for sexual harassment.I'm fine. It was just a little bit intimidating, y'know?People like that shouldn't be in charge of patients.You sure love your break times!Missus Hardesty, you scared me! What are you doing up at this time?Sorry, I forgot you don't talk. I'll just go and get an orderly.What did you say?I'll... I'll go get an orderly.Hi.Bite me.Look, I don't want any trouble. I just came to tell you there's a patient whose out of their room in Ward B.She was right there, in that chair.Missus Hardesty.Yeah. She even spoke to me!Yes!Look I know she's supposed to be catatonic but I swear she said something to me!What do you mean?But I could have sworn...Hello?Little girl, wait!Don't go in there! Lisa rushes down the stairs after her.Little girl? Lisa slowly walks down the hallway, passing the cell doors. She can hear whispering. Lisa is drawn to the last door on the left. She approaches with caution. Stood in front of the door she slowly slides the hatch open and peers inside. John Doe sits in the corner, cloaked in shadow. Lisa peers down and in the centre of the floor, illuminated by a single shaft of light from the small window, is a TEDDY BEAR. Lisa slides the hatch shut and walks backwards. She is seriously unnerved. As she steps back from the door she hears a whispering from Kimble's cell. She edges closer to his cell door and listens.Of course I do. Suddenly tears of BLOOD run down Lisa's cheeks. Lisa's mother reaches out a hand. Lisa stretches her arm out to grab her mother's hand. Everything is in slow motion, it seems to take Lisa forever to reach her mother's hand. Suddenly a BLACK GLOVED HAND grabs her outstretched arm. She turns to see a HOODED FIGURE, face shrouded in darkness, standing next to her. A deep voice echoes around the church:Umm... could you do that?I dunno... I just need a break.A little.Well... maybe not.I can hear them talking. It's kinda unnerving.What... what do you expect me to say?How... how do you know all this?You sick fuck!What is it?I'm not going down to Ward X again, I'm really sorry I just can't handle it down there!They say things to me through the doors. Horrible things!But that woman Sadie, she says things she couldn't possibly know about me.I sound crazy don't I?I'm starting to wonder if I'm losing my mind.It's hard to keep them out sometimes.I'm really sorry about this, I didn't think it would effect me so much.Thank you. I really appreciate that.I just heard something so I ... I was just curious.Oh nothing, I didn't see anything.I won't say anything.Of course.I'm so sorry I'm running late Nanc!YEAHThanks.Oh thanks!The whole job's getting to me. My body clock's all out of whack but it's not just that. There's something seriously wrong with that place.Thanks.I figure it'll wake me up a little.A lot of things. The way they run things for starters, the orderlies are complete bastards.Some of the patients are extremely violent.No, nothing like that. Some of the things they say though... it's pretty frightening. The weirdest thing is... Oh I dunno, maybe it's just me. I wonder if I'm seeing things.I think the place might be haunted. Either that or I'm losing my mind.What do you mean?Yeah?Yeah.What's that?No.I vaguely remember hearing some stuff a while ago, but I never really took it in. I honestly didn't realise that the hospital was on the same land.Either that or I'm going crazy.You believe in ghosts?Thanks Nanc.Part of me says I should. There's a lot about the place that frightens me. But I dunno... I think I've seen too much to be able to just walk away and forget the place.Well I need the money for starters. But now it feels like I need to find out more.Do you know the history of this place?No, I mean the history of the land.Yeah.One Twelve Ocean Avenue. The Amityville haunted house.I didn't know about it until a friend told me.How come you never mentioned it?Y'know why I'm spooked?It's not just that Delaney. I think this place is haunted. In fact, I'm sure of it.Remember I said I saw a little girl roaming the hallways here? I know who she is. She's one of the DeFeo children who were killed. You ever seen her?Honestly?Well I wasn't a huge believer, but I know what I've seen.Extra terrestrial is aliens.So what do you believe in? Do you believe in God?I'm just curious.It's something I've been thinking about. How can evil exist in aIt's a frightening thing to believe that if God exists he is not powerful enough to stop evil.Doctor Mixter must have known what stood on this land before the hospital.Why would he build on this land knowing the history of the place?Like what?Really?I don't know what to think.Hi, sorry to bother you but my name's Lisa Templeton. I rang yesterday to set up a meeting with Gloria Branco.Oh great! Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.Thank you, that's great.Yes that's right. I'm writing a college paper and I had heard some rumours in the neighbourhood about Native Americans being killed on the land down on Oceans Avenue.You mean the DeFeo murders at One Twelve?Yeah it's awful.So what about the native Americans? Is that story about them being killed on that land true?So the legend has basis in historical fact?You told me the other night that you think evil is within us all. But do you think that people can be influenced by an evil that comes from outside of themselves?I guess I am yeah.There's something going on in this place. Something sinister. And I don't just mean the patients on Ward X. Have you not noticed that?Why haven't you said anything? Or done anything?What do you mean?I know what you're doing.I've seen that blog. How are you getting access to the internet?Are you allowed to have all this stuff in your cell huh?What's going to happen? You're planning on a human sacrifice aren't you?Tell me!!Doctor Mixter.I just wondered if I could speak to you for a moment sir. It's very important.Well... what I'm going to tell you will sound really strange but I need to tell you.Do you know the history of the land the hospital is built on?Well, first of all. The DeFeo murders and the infamous house that people said was haunted.Maybe. Are you aware of the history of the land dating back to the eighteenth century?There were a group of Native Americans in Amityville known as \"The Satchem Tribe\". They were massacred by Christians after a dispute over the land.Yes. Sadie Krenwinkel down on Ward X. She shares the beliefs of the Satchem Tribe. I have reason to believe that somehow she has access to the internet and Witchcraft paraphernalia and she's planning on a human sacrifice tonight to try and raise the God she believes in, The Dark Master, and become immortal.I'm serious.Go on the internet and check out the Blog! She signs herself Sister Sadie.Go down and search her cell!Then someone is helping her get access to this stuff! Someone who works here! Please Doctor Mixter. Just check out her cell and speak to her. If I'm wrong about this and it's all just her delusions then fine. I'll accept that. But I had to tell you. You testified at her trial didn't you?Nothing. I just meant you know how dangerous she is.I know that it might sound like that. But can you check her cell and speak to her? Look at the blog on the internet, see if you can connect the IP number of the writer with a computer here at the hospital.Thank you.What the hell are you doing??Fuck you!!!Let me out of here you sick fuck!!Why are you doing this?I'm not having delusions, I know what I've seen!You do this to all your staff huh? The minute we speak out we get fucking committed??No, no. You're lying to me, I know who I am! I KNOW WHO I AM!!But... but...Okay.Thank you.Okay.Yes. Thank you.Fuck!!Please help us!Shouldn't we help them??Hey mister, you need to get the hell out of here, there's a patient going crazy with a gun!!Come on, hurry, please!!What, what??Fuck!!Lights out, you son-of-a-bitch!! BANG! The shot gun BLASTS a hole through Patient X's chest, blood splatters over Lisa. Suddenly a WHITE LIGHT fills the room and ALLISON DEFEO materialises. She is dressed in a clean white dress, her angelic complexion bears no wounds. Allison takes the hand of PATIENT X's corpse. The WHITE LIGHT swarms over Patient X's body and he rises to his feet. His head is now intact and he is dressed in a white robe. He looks at Allison and they share a peaceful smile. Allison walks with Patient X through a doorway filled with a blinding WHITE LIGHT. They disappear and the light slowly dissipates.Get your fucking hands up you sick fuck!You gonna tell me it's all in my head now huh?? Wanna tell me I'm the crazy one??Get the fuck out of my head you son-of-a-bitch! I know who I am and I know what I've seen! You're part of all of this. I know you are! You're the crazy one!!Why did you do this? Why??You fucking believe that do you?? Sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me! You're no better than those fucking fundamentalists who kill innocent people because they've twisted shit they've read in some Holy book. It's all shit!!How about if I blow your fucking head off then huh??What the fuck are you laughing at?The cops coming here? I'm gonna tell them everything about you and your little sick plan! They're gonna lock you up and throw away the key!!What did you say??You shut the fuck about my mother, you don't know anything!!I have not forgotten about her!!SHUT UP!!

clean this up and we'll get to it.This is the storage cupboard. Everything you will need for eachThe most obvious task is hoovering. This is our hoover here, it's straight forward. You'll be surprised that although it's powerful it's very quiet, because we are working when everyone's in bed so obviously we don't want to wake them up! It has a Telescopic suction tube and six stage filter system. So a lot more powerful than you may be used to.The mop and bucket is here, we usually use standard bleach to mix with the water so that's straight forward. But there is this specialist stain remover that you must use if there are any stains on the floor or carpet. It needs to be sprayed and left to set for twenty minutes before scrubbing or mopping. It's a special formula for tea, coffee, water marks and other yellow and brown discolourations on the carpets or floors. It's pretty strong so wash your hands after you use it!One of the worst parts of the job is we have to remove chewing gum from lots of surfaces. They don't just stick it underneath the tables, it ends up everywhere!Yes! I think a lot of the time it's the staff doing it, not the patients! But we have this GumCart, which is a bit complicated but it's easier than just scraping the gum. The steam is super heated to one hundred eighty degrees and delivered at seven point zero bar pressure. It can produce a hundred and fifteen litres of superheated steam per minute.No problem. Now here we come to the most dangerous chemical we have. This is a concrete cleaner, very toxic stuff, so you have to wear the face mask and gloves we have here, okay?This is for cleaning and descaling brick, stone and concrete and for metal de-rusting. For concrete you must mix it one part to four parts water. Brush or spray it on with the equipment here then leave it five to ten minutes to set, then rinse it off. But for those stubborn son-of-a-bitch marks use it neat!Don't worry if anything seems complicated, you'll get used to it. But you'll mostly be mopping and hoovering in your first few weeks.This is Ward B, one of two wards you'll be responsible for cleaning each evening. Essentially the main duties will be emptying the bins, hoovering the carpeted areas and mopping the hallways. The patients in here are Category B. They're mainly people who have had nervous breakdowns and those who are catatonic. They're harmless. Like Missus Hardesty here.Hello Missus Hardesty.She hasn't spoken a word in all her time here. The orderlies just lift her from the bedroom to the day room and back again every day.We've still got to treat them like human beings. Otherwise they just become like furniture and we all lose our humanity. I like to think she can hear me, even if she won't talk to me. See you later Missus Hardesty.The patients are locked in their rooms on our night shift, but now and again they might have an accident we gotta clean up.In the day time there are nurses who often clean up but in the night we may be called to provide fresh linen or mop up. Not the most pleasant of jobs but it happens from time to time.Now here we come to the most difficult part of the job.Oh no, that's very easy compared to what's behind this door.This leads down to Ward X.You could say that. It's where Category A patients are held. The criminally insane.Yes, well, these patients are beyond help so they've become athe hospital's secret. Many of them were transferred from prisons and other institutions. Doctor Mixter probably thought he could help them. He can't. The staff call this place Blood Row.It always hangs in the air. No matter how much we bleach the floor there is always that smell of death.Yes. But don't worry, we never have to interact directly or anything like that. You will just be mopping the corridor and dusting.That's Jerry Kimble. He was convicted of stabbing a young mother forty-nine times in front of her two year-old son, then killing and sexually assaulting a woman before smothering her four-year-old daughter. They call him the Green Chain Rapist. He was in Sing Sing but was certified insane and his lawyer got him transferred here. He doesn't make any noise or fuss, but he is a dangerous man. Especially towards women. This next inmate is even worse. Delaney slides the hatch shut and walks over to the next door. He slowly slides open the hatch and Lisa peers inside. Another basic white cell with only a bed and toilet. A man stands in the centre of the room with his hands behind his back. His hair is slicked back, as jet black as the eyes that stare at Lisa. He smiles. Delaney slides the hatch shut.That's Dennis Palmer. Also known as The Long Island Cannibal. He was abused as a child so his targets were always paedophiles and rapists. He'd track them down and torture them. He would eat parts of their body while they were still alive.The most horrible thing is that a lot of the public thought he was a hero.Sadie Krenwinkel.She was a member of a Witchcraft cult. They kidnapped six people for a demonic ritual. Five were killed but one got away and led police to the cult. She turned her trial into a circus, talking about lots of crazy stuff. The media enjoyed it but she got certified insane by the court. She's been around a few institutions since. Now she's here.Well those aren't the strangest.This last patient is the strangest case. Delaney walks over to the last door on the left. He slides open the hatch. A singular shaft of light coming from a tiny barred window barely penetrates the darkness of the cell. Lisa peers inside to see a man sat in the shadows.This is our resident John Doe. Sometimes we have people withThey first brought him in about six months ago. No one knows where he came from, he literally just turned up late one night. An orderly found him wandering the grounds. First of all he was like Missus Hardesty upstairs-catatonic. Then a few weeks later he started to respond to Doctor Mixter and the nurses through facial expressions and gestures. But soon, he got violent. Very violent. He'd have bursts of rage and beat other patients. One day he appeared to have a seizure and collapsed. A young doctor tried to take his vital signs. Patient X here throttled him so hard he crushed his larynx. It took six orderlies to restrain him. Now they won't even let him out for the obligatory hour a day exercise. We still don't know who he is.God has nothing to do with this man. Delaney slams the hatch shut. Lisa looks disturbed.I haven't put you off have I?This is the reality of this place. We don't deal with these people directly but we may have to clean up their mess. If you can't handleSorry, I didn't mean to startle you.Are you okay?Sorry.Do you want to grab a coffee?Did you change the bins in the Day Room?Good. I've got a light bulb to change in Room Twelve upstairs soon. We're making good time.Doctor Mixter told me you were the only person he interviewed for the job.Yeah. I'm sure he felt you were right for the job and didn't need to interview anyone else.Oh yeah. I forget I have it sometimes.Well... it represents a lot of wrong turns in my younger years.It's okay. Let's just say the past is better left there.So how is the first night going for you?You sure it was a young girl of that age?Umm... okay.Well... there are no children of that age here.In fact, there are no children of any age in this place. I think our youngest patient is about twenty.No, I'm serious.You sure you saw a girl that young?I better tell the orderlies. This is no place for a little girl to be.No.Don't worry about it. Better safe than sorry.Hey, can you do me a favour?Can you empty the rubbish in Doctor Mixter's office? I've got to check the boiler, there's been complaints about the heating not working.Pemberton!Leave her alone.No problem. Lisa, come with me, we've got a job up on Ward B. A grateful Lisa brushes past Pemberton and exits the room. Delaney glares at Pemberton for a moment before leaving the room. Pemberton smirks.You okay?Pemberton can be like that. He works nights with that other son- of-a-bitch Hardcastle. They like to throw their weight around. You'll get used to it.Let's get a coffee.I like to pace myself! Lisa smiles.Okay, next thing is mopping the floor in Ward X.Why?Does Ward X frighten you?That's normal, it frightens me sometimes. But I've got to go up to a patient's room in Ward A. Apparently they've had a little accident. Surely you wouldn't prefer to clean that up?I know Ward X is a scary place. But you'll get used to it.I know, I hear that too when I'm down there. But trust me, once you get used to it things will get easier.What's wrong Lisa?Okay, just calm down okay. Tell me what happened.I know, they've done it to me too.Like what?No. This place just gets under your skin sometimes.Well it's not healthy to think too much about what those crazy son-of- a-bitches say. Believe me you don't want them inside your head.Listen, take a break from Ward X for a while. I'll go down there for the next week or so.Don't worry, it gets to everyone at first. But the last thing I want is for you to dread coming to work.No problem.There's not much history. We've only been open a couple of years.You mean... what was on the land before the hospital?I know a bit about that.Well I don't know that it was haunted. Lots of people think that's lies. I know about the kid that killed his family. That's true.Really? It's a famous case.You seem spooked already. I didn't want to make it worse.Because of the patients on Ward X.You've seen something?No.To be honest I don't believe in all that ghost stuff.I believe that you've seen something. Some people are more open to that kind of thing, y'know? But me? I'm closed off to that extra terrestrial stuff.Whatever it's called, I don't know.Serious questions tonight.Why do you ask?I don't believe that God is a bearded man who lives in the sky. Or that the Devil is a red demon with horns. I believe God and Satan are within all of us. God is our human side. Satan is our animal side. Whether we become good or evil depends which side of us we feed.Free will in the hands of a person who feeds the Evil inside them. That's what frightens me.Of course he did. He bought the land and organised the demolition of the house himself.He's not superstitious. He's a doctor, they don't usually believe in those things. Amityville is full of local legends, going back even before the DeFeos.There's stories about the Native Americans being slaughtered on this land many years ago. Some peopleI don't think that's true. If I've learnt anything from the patients on Ward X, it's that some people have a mind that works in a different way to other people. Those people who do bad things have fed the evil within them more than the good. It's not possession, it's sickness. Sickness of the soul.Just don't let your imagination run away with you Lisa. You're a person who feeds that good within you. Don't let this place feed the evil.Are you still thinking about this?I worry that you're thinking too much. This place is getting to you.I've noticed some things.It's like the honey bee.The honey bee is fine when it's just flying from flower to flower. Then they think that a person is a threat and they sting them. They might leave a sting but the person will recover. The bee dies. So I ask myself... is it worth it?We need to get out of here! One of the patients is running around with a shot gun down on Ward X!The patients are loose!We need to save ourselves. Let them reap what they've sewn.What?Kurwa!!A fucking key's been snapped in the lock! Delaney rushes to the reception desk and grabs a chair. He rushes over to a window next to the door and raises the chair. BANG! A bullet tears through his back and exits through his chest with an explosion of blood. Lisa SCREAMS! Delaney drops to his knees and Lisa rushes to his side. Patient X loads fresh cartridges in the rifle. Delaney is DEAD. Lisa runs down the hallway. Patient X takes aim. Just as Lisa bursts through a door, a bullet blasts apart one side of the frame.", "clean_line": "work nights today ll okay ll clean ll storage cupboard need eachthe obvious task hoovering hoover
