{"You-Can-Count-On-Me": {"SAMMY": {"raw_line": "You're not supposed to go out, Amy.Rudy, come on! I'm really late!How was school?Why do you say that?What do you mean?So what's wrong with that?Well, I'm sure you'll be able to think of something. If you can't, I'll help you.Don't forget your backpack.Don't forget your knapsack.Give me a kiss.Oh no, really?Mr. Everett?Brian. Hi. I'm Samantha Prescott -- I'm the lending officer?I am so sorry I was late...I got held up. Believe me, it is not something I make a habit of...-- so I always just run out at 3:15 to pick him up and then run him real quick over to the sitter's house. Anyway, Larry never minded about it and I was just hoping it would be OK with you too...No it's not...Oh -- No -- Rudy Sr. isn't \"on the scene.\" So to speak.Well -- Brian? I understand what you're saying, and I think it's great. I do. Because there's a lot of things around here that could use some attention. Believe me. But I've honestly been meeting that bus every day for four years now and it really does take just fifteen minutes, and if I take the time out of my lunch hour...I'll do my best...!He's eight.What?!He can stay in the little room. But you know what? He's not going to live here. He's only gonna stay for a little while... And it's OK if you don't remember him, because you were only six the last time he was here... But it'll be nice if you got a chance to get to know each other a little bit. Don't you think?Rudy? Would it distract you if I put on some music?Did you think of a story?What's it about?What about your father?Can I read it when you're done?Don't say that.Anyway, Bob, it's sort of this adventure story, and Rudy's father is this secret agent or something, working for the government... And it just made me feel weird. You know? Because I never really say much to him about Rudy Sr., because I don't know what to say. And I don't know whether I should just let him imagine whatever he wants to imagine, or whether I should sit him down sometime and tell him, you know, that his father is not such a nice person. You know?Not much. He knows I don't have the highest opinion of him. And he knows I don't want to see him or know anything about him, ever. But I tried to keep it kind of neutral. Anyway... I could go into a lot more detail, believe me.All right.OK.What?I bet you were surprised...!I should get going...Yeah... I've got the baby-sitter... But... Thanks for a lovely evening.Hello?... TERRY!...I don't care --I don't care, Terry. I'm just so glad to see you...!Um, no, it's Saturday...Oh. No. You know, I just thought I'd -- You know I thought it was a special occasion... which it is...That's OK. You look fine.What?I'm fine.We're fine, Terry. How are you? I mean ---- Where have you been lately, Terry?I got a postcard from you from Alaska...?But that was in the Fall, Terry...I was a little worried. I mean --Well... I just wish you would have let me know you were OK...Are you gonna stay in town for a while?Oh...Oh... Well... That's all right...!Are you expecting someone?You just keep looking around, that's all.You were what?What?!What did you do?No!Oh my God! ---- What happened?!OK -- Can you please stop cursing at me?I'm sorry.Hey -- You don't write me for six months, I have no idea where you are ---- I don't know if you're alive or dead ---- and then you show up out of nowhere and tell me you were in jail?What?What do you need? Money?I really wish Mom was here.Nobody knows what to do with you.Terry? Can I ask you something?Well -- I mean, do you ever go to church anymore?Do you?Can you tell me why not?Well -- can you tell me without like, denigrating what I believe in?Well -- I mean, have you ever considered that maybe that's part of what's making things so difficult for you?-- That you've lost hold of -- well, not just your religious feeling, but lost hold of any kind of anchor, any kind of trust in anything... I mean no wonder you drift around so much. What could ever stop you? How would you ever know if you had found the right thing?To pick up Rudy.Well, of course I want you to visit, you idiot! I've been looking forward to seeing you more than anything! I've been telling everyone I know that you were coming home! I cleaned the whole fucking house so it would look nice for you! I thought you were gonna stay for at least a few days! It didn't occur to me that you were just broke again. I wish you would have just sent me an invoice!What?Do you have everything you need?What are you going to do?Maybe you should stay home for a little while, Terry.I'm going to bed. Do you have everything you need?Good night.Terry, I'm really glad you're home.OK. So we'll drop Rudy off at the bus, then all you have to do is drop me off at the bank, and just pick Rudy up at 3:30 in front of town hall, and drive him over to Carol's house. And that's it. She's on Harvey Lane, right past where the Dewitts used to live.Rudy knows where she lives.God, Mabel, don't those colors hurt your eyes?Um, Brian? Did you want us to turn this time sheet in at the end of the day, or do you want it at the end of the week...?Seems like an awful lot of extra paperwork...You've got to be kidding me.Brian? Did you want to see me?Oh -- Didn't Mabel -- I had a false alarm about my son...Well, I did work it out -- more or less --Brian, don't yell at me.Well Brian:...And Eddy Dwyer lives in Buffalo, with his wife and two sons, if you can believe it.Why?No comment.No, my computer palette's pretty conservative.What are you wearing?What's up?Um, yeah, thanks, I did.Are you guys sure you're gonna be OK?What is happening here?Why don't I just call the plumber?Thank you. Thank you both.Now, call if there's any problem, and if I'm not there, I'm either on my way or on my way back home.So lights out at ten... and don't spend the whole night watching TV.Two hours tops.Bob... Are you serious?I... I don't know what to say. I --I... I'm totally... I don't know what to say.That's it: I want to think about it.What is going on in here?Did you know my Mommy used to take me and Uncle Terry out at night to look at the constellations?Did you see that one, what's the one -- It looks like a big \"W\"? Cassiopeia?Ow! Shit!I've got a great idea. Why don't you let me call the plumber?Oh, does that make you mad?Brian, get off my ass!I didn't change the colors on your stupid computer screen.There is nothing wrong with the work I do here. I have been doing just fine, the whole time before you came here -- And if you think that riding people in this petty, ridiculous way is the way to improve service in this bank or anywhere else I think you're out of your mind!No, that's really all I have to --Well --Brian --I am not late and I do not have an attitude -- Well then don't tell me I'm late if I'm not late!They were where?Hi. It's nice to meet you.Brian...?Rudy!Look, I'm glad you guys are getting along so well -- like, you have no idea -- but if I can't rely on you to remember to get him once a day...-- And what are you doing taking him to play pool in the middle of the night, and then telling him to lie to me about it?How did your wife like the bank?That's too bad.Pregnant?It can make you kind of cranky.Yeah, I am too... I know you're not, Brian, but you're driving everybody crazy.I know you are...Well... I could use a beer.Last I heard, Rudy's Dad was living over in Auburn. But that was last year.Oh... It's just the hormones.Amen.You can't judge all of Scottsville by the people in that bank, believe me.OK.Good idea.Yeah?I'll never tell.Nowhere. I had dinner with my boss.Yeah. How was Rudy?Did the plumber come?Terry -- Give me a break!!!Nothing. I'm just tired.No I don't. Why, you got some?So... Bob asked me to marry him.I don't know. If he'd've asked me this time last year I would have probably said yes. But the minute he said it, I don't know, I felt like somebody was trying to strangle me.I know. Plus, Terry... I fucked my boss...!I know! And his wife is six months pregnant.I know, I know.Terry, I'm sorry I got so mad before. I just don't want him, you know -- terrified of \"telling,\" if there's --Oh really? What's his problem?Oh yeah? And how do you think he should behave?Uh huh. And what do you --First of all, he didn't tell me anything: Darryl did. OK? Second of all, I don't really give a shit if you took him to play pool: I was mad at you because you left him standing at the bus stop in the rain. But no, I don't want you telling him not to squeal, because I don't want him put in that position!You are in idiot.Yes!Morning.Listen -- I just --Brian, that's enough.I'm sorry.Of course I've been thinking about it.Well -- I mean -- I don't know, Bob. I mean, we haven't exactly been going steady the last few months, if you know what I mean ---- and then we see each other twice and you suddenly say you want to get married? I mean...What are you talking about?Don't make me feel bad for you.Hello?Brian. Where are you?Brian, I think you're going crazy.Um, OK.Um -- I have to go out for a minute. Do you want anything?I don't know.I just have to go out for a little while.I just have to go to Mabel's house.You know what, Rudy? It's personal. This is a personal matter that has to do with Mabel. I just have to go see her for a little while.Well, a lot. But principally... I was just wondering if you had an opinion. If you know someone, in your family, or just someone you really care about, and they just can't seem to get ahold of themselves...That's great, honey.Well... I didn't mean to discourage you --What do you mean?I'll take you, sweetie.I realize that you're mad at me ---- but he didn't do anything to you. And you cannot promise a little boy that you're gonna --Would you please...Listen. I am sure, if you put your mind to it, you can think of some other way of getting back at me besides this. So would you please just give it some thought, and take him fishing tomorrow?You suck.Anyway... I don't know what the church's position is on adultery and fornication these days, but I felt really hypocritical not saying anything to you about it before, so... What is the official position on that stuff these days?Good: I think it should be.Why not?I think you should.Maybe it was better when you came in and they screamed at you for having sex with your married boss, and were really mean to you, and told you what a terrible thing it was. Maybe it'd be better if you told me how I'm endangering my immortal soul, and if I don't quit I'm going to burn in hell. Don't you ever think that?Well, it's a lot better than all this \"Why do you think you're in this situation\" psychological bullshit you hear all the time.With which one?I feel sorry for them. Isn't that ridiculous?No. I'm not gonna stay long. Bob, I don't want to get married.I've really thought about it a lot, and if you had asked me last year I'm sure I would have said yes.But I'm not sure it would have been a good idea then either. I'm going through a really hard time right now and I just think that getting engaged to you or anyone would be just about the stupidest most self-destructive thing I could possibly do.And I really think you have to grow up.Bob... This is so crazy... I mean... I don't even understand why you... I don't even get it.Bob...!Well -- I don't know...Well -- I mean -- I love you too --Oh shit.I gotta go. I'm sorry --I'm supposed to -- I gotta get Mabel back her car.Oh God, I don't know. Call me later.Sorry I'm so late.Well -- maybe it would've been better if you had...I mean -- Look, I don't mean to be unsympathetic about your domestic situation, whatever it is, but I'm just beginning to think that if people tried a little harder to stick to their commitments and started taking a little responsibility for their actions, they might end up having a lot less trouble generally. That's all.Well, I really don't think I can do this anymore.This is incredible.That is not what I mean.What time is it?Oh my gosh.You know... Brian...Well, I don't want to... I mean, couldn't we just... I mean, could we give it a rest?I mean... I just think... I don't know: We had a great little fling. You know? Let's not push it. I mean, is that OK? I just --So are we still friends?All right. Good...!Around two o'clock this afternoon... Yeah, a ninety three Toyota Tercel. New York plates V127AC... Please.Thanks for coming over. I just want to have a car handy just in case.Well -- what about other towns?... Yes! Yes! I called the highway patrol four times... Well what am I supposed to do all night?Hello?Darryl, I really appreciate this...Hello?Brian --Hello?GOOD!Rudy?Is there anything you want to ask me, about your father?What?No -- Rudy -- that was him. But that was him. I wish it wasn't, but it was.Rudy. Yes it was. Your father's name is Rudy Kolinski. He lives in Auburn...Could you turn that off for a minute please?I want you to leave.I mean I don't think you should live here anymore. I don't think you know how to behave around an eight-year- old and I don't know how to make you stop, so I think you shouldn't live here. I don't know what else to say.That's right --Are you out of your MIND!?!Now you just listen to me. I may not be the greatest mother in the world, but I'm doing the best I know how. And he doesn't need you to rub his face in shit because you think it's good for him. He's going to find out the world is a horrible place and that people suck soon enough, and without any help from you. Believe me!I think you should get your own place. I thought, if you want, you could -- I'll be glad to help you out financially --I mean I --Yes.Well... If that's what you want to do, that's fine. But that's not what I'm saying. You are a very important person to Rudy, and you are the most important person to me. But I'm saying that I can't take any more of this ---- I thought -- maybe you could sell your half of the house to me, and I could pay you whatever it is over a certain amount of time, and that way --Well -- that's not what I'm saying.Is that for you?You don't have to do that.Well but -- Are you gonna come back to say good-bye?Well --Look. I know you're upset about Uncle Terry leaving, and so am I. But he's just not in control of himself, and I don't want him hurting your feelings anymore -- or mine. And you may not like it, but that's how it's gotta be. OK?You don't care. I don't care either.Thank you.Yeah...?I know I'd --I'm really sorry I didn't --You're not serious.You know you're the worst manager we've ever had?By far the worst.Well, I don't want to be fired, Brian. I've been working here for seven years.And if I were you I'd be a little nervous about firing an employee I just had an affair with. OK?I'm not thr -- You explore it. I'm going back to work.Oh, and I have to pick up Rudy today because there's no one else to do it. But I'll find someone as soon as I have time.Well, I called where Uncle Terry said he was gonna stay, and there was no answer, so I don't know if he's still in town or not.Rudy? Are you not speaking to me?Well, I'm sorry you're so mad at me, but I only did what I thought I had to do, and I hope you don't stay mad at me for the rest of your life.Rudy, that's too much.You gotta cut this out!You don't know what you're talking about! There was nothing else I could do! I can't explain it better than that, but you can't go on like this because you don't know anything about it and you don't know what you're doing!I don't want you to be sorry, I just want you to STOP IT!Hi.I didn't know if you left yet.Well -- What time?Well -- Can I -- I'd like to see you before you go. I mean, can I give you a lift? Or do you want to have breakfast or anything? And I think Rudy would really like to say good- bye.Terry, you can't just leave like this. I --All right -- But just -- We have to be out of the house by eight, so -- I don't want to tell Rudy you're coming unless you really think you can make it --All right.You should get your sneakers on.Sweetie, I'm sorry, we have to go.Do you need some cash for the bus?Oh -- Yeah. That's OK. Terry, I don't even know where you're going.Oh, are you gonna try to see that girl?What?...I don't want anyone to have a crack at you.You will?What is gonna happen to you?Well, Terry --I do root for you.I feel like I'm never gonna see you again...!Please don't go till you know where you're going.

that money from you?Is that all you have?Can you borrow some cash from your brother?Well, I'm definitely gonna be gone for a couple of days at least, Sheila.Because my sister is not a bank, you know? I can't just show up and ask her for --Oh Sheila can we just cut out the puerile crap?! I'll be back just as soon as I can. OK? I am not the kind of man that everyone says I am.I'll call you tonight.I love you.Well... I think after this is over you should seriously consider moving back home.All right...Definitely.Sorry.How you doin', Darryl?I'm just goin' to see Sammy at Dawson's...Sure, yeah --Yeah, I was workin' out there for a little while...Yeah, I've been all over the place...Thanks, Darryl. Keep enforcing the peace.No, man, I'm reformed.Thanks, Darryl.Sorry about yesterday --I was studying the bus description... and I just... I got on the wrong bus -- I mean I missed my stop --I'm glad to see you too, Sammy. Um... are you coming from work?Yeah, no, it's just... you're dressed so formally...No, it's good.

I got all these things I gotta do back in Worcester......Yeah, so I'm probably not gonna be able to stay more than a day or so......I'm kind of trying to keep to a schedule of sorts. It's a long and worthy story but I won't trouble you with it right now.Who would I be expecting here?No, I was just wondering if we could get some more refreshments, actually.I've actually got to confess to you, Sammy... that the reason you may not have heard from me for a little while is that I've been kind of unable to write... on account of the fact that I was in jail for a little while.Well, I did a little time, I guess, in Florida. For, uh, just for bullshit...It was just bullshit...I didn't do anything. Does it occur to you that maybe I was wronged?Well, could I please --Would you please let me --I got into a fight in a bar down in Florida. Which I was not the one who instigated it, at all. But they worked up all this bullshit against me and they threw me in the pen for three months. I didn't write you because I didn't want you to get all upset about it. I just figured you'd figure I was on the road for a little while. I know it was stupid and I'm sorry. I really didn't mean to make you worry. But you know what? I can't run around all the time doin' stuff or not doin' stuff because it's gonna make you worry! Because then I come back here, and I tell you about my fuckin'... traumas, and I get this wounded little \"I've Let You Down\" bullshit, over and over again, and it really just -- cramps me! Like I just want to get out from under it!... And here I am back in this fuckin' hole explaining myself to you again!I mean, I realize I'm in no position to, uh, basically say anything, ever -- But it's not like I'm down there in some redneck bar in Florida having an argument with some stripper's boyfriend and I suddenly think, \"Hey! Maybe this'd be a good time to really stick it to Sammy and get myself locked up for a few months.\"Me too, man. I mean \"welcome home.\"I'm sorry --I'm sorry --I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Sammy, I'm really sorry...!Sammy...Um... I'm in the midst of a slight predicament...Um... Yeah... I'm broke. I gotta get back to Worcester tomorrow. I got this girl there, and she's kind of in a bad situation...? I just need to borrow some money. Whatever you can spare. I'll pay you back... I'll pay you back, man.So do I, man.I know how they feel, man.Sure.Come on, Sammy, can we not talk about that shit?Um -- No, Sammy. I don't.Um, yeah. Because I think it's ridiculous.Because I think it's primitive, OK? I think it's a fairy tale.No.Well, uh, I'm not really looking for anything, man. I'm just, like, trying to get on with it.Thank you, Sammy... I'm really gonna pay this back.Where we going?Well... do you not even want me to visit now? 'Cause I can catch the bus at five o'clock if that's what you want.Hi, is that Malcolm?... Hi, this is Terry Prescott?... I been trying to get ahold of Sheila and there's no answer, and I was just wondering if she -- She what?...When?... Well -- Is she all right?... Well, could I talk to her?... Well, could you give her a message that I --That girl I'm with tried to kill herself.She tried to kill herself.I think so.I don't know. Send the money I guess.Yeah, maybe that'd be a good idea.Yeah. Thanks.Good night.Yeah, me too, Sammy.OK.OK.Looks that way.Put on your seat belt.What?Well, when somebody slams into us and you go sailin' through the windshield, that's liable to be uncomfortable too. So put on your seat belt.I know. They're my parents too.Well, yeah. Your mom is my sister.So that means we have the same parents.Hey. Look.You hold it further down, you're gonna get a lot more power. You should be able to put that nail down with two or three hits. Look:Try it.Well, the way you hold it is wrong.You can.That is depressing.He just never struck me as the marrying type, that's all.Wild kids we used to know.Not compared to your Mom.You don't believe me?Ask her.Oh -- Just readin' some of your compositions.Um... Because it's bad. Don't ever do it.You know this used to be my room?No.No. I wasn't even born yet.No.I know. Unfortunately he didn't fight in Vietnam either.Not really. We had some friends in common, I guess... I didn't like him very much.Well, he wasn't very likable.I don't know. He was always -- He always had to be better than you at everything. You know. Like if you were all playing basketball or something, everybody's havin' like a friendly game and he's like ready to kill somebody if his team didn't win. Or like if you told like a joke or a story, he always had to tell a better one? Kinda gets annoying after a while. Plus it was pretty scummy how he split on your mom and you... He was a prick. Probably still a prick. Fortunately for you though, your mom is like, the greatest. So you had some bad luck and you had some good luck. You mind if I ask you a personal question?Do you like it here? I mean, in Scottsville?Why?I know, I know, but it's so... There's nothing to do here.No there isn't, man! It's narrow. It's dull. It's a dull, narrow town full of dull, narrow people who don't know anything except... what things are like right around here. They have no perspective whatsoever. No scope. They might as well be living in the nineteenth century because they have no idea what's going on, and if you try to tell 'em that, they wanna fuckin' kill you.I don't know...You're a good kid.Do you know you have an enormous leak from the upstairs hall?Yes. Yes.It's just -- The problem is that the pipe is corroded all the way along the length of the hall. So every time I put in a new piece it starts leaking further down.Why? He's not gonna do anything different than what I'm doing.No we're not. Shut up.OK.Nice to meet you, Bob.What's your idea of the whole night?What's your feeling about Bob?I have bad news for you.Do you know how to play pool?Well, we're not allowed to watch any more TV, so it's this or nothing... But if we run into any trouble, let me do the talking.I got a hundred bucks here says me and my nephew can beat anybody in here. Only we gotta get the next game 'cause he's gotta be in bed by ten o'clock.Just hit it nice and soft... Nice and soft.God damn, Rudy. I thought you said you could play.Boys, it's all over but the cryin'.Ohhhh!It's all yours, baby.Just make sure to hit it really gentle. But firm. And hit it a little low so you get some backspin. Don't even hit it. Just kiss it.I mean tap it. Firm but very, very softly. And don't shoot until you know it's going in. OK?That was great!Ssh...! Don't move.It's them!Go! Go! Go!Wait a minute, gimme your jacket!What are you doing?Um -- We were just out doing some star-gazing, and, uh, Rudy lost track of the time. Which I totally warned him about. You are a bad kid.Hey: I think it's OK. Just don't tell her where we went, 'cause she'll be really mad at me. OK?Hey -- I'm not kidding, Rudy.Do whatever you want.No...You can!I don't know.Get out of the car.You're going to Carol's house and I'm going home.Because if you're such a baby you gotta tell your Mommy about us playin' pool when I totally asked you not to, and I gotta listen to her shit all day, then you're goin' to the baby-sitter's so you can stay at the baby house.You know what? Don't even fuckin' talk to me.Just get out of the car.Where were you?Kind of a late dinner, ain't it?Fine.Yes, the fucking plumber came.What's the matter with you?You want to smoke some pot?Wow. Are you going to?Well... bad sign.What?Jesus Christ, Sammy...!Uh, well, that's not really his problem, Sammy.His problem is that he's like totally sheltered because you treat him like he's three, instead of eight, so that's how he behaves.I think he shouldn't have to run and tell his Mommy every time he does something she might not like, for one thing.I mean I took him to play pool! It was a little clandestine thing we did for fun! It wasn't like a big secret, I mean who cares? I was actually trying to be nice to him. But he's so freaked out that he disobeyed your orders that he has to fuckin' squeal on me and I have to listen to your fuckin' shit all day when I didn't even fuckin' do anything!Well... that... is a perfect example of what I'm talking about.Darryl told you?Like what?Yeah, where are you going?Yeah, where?Listen. Listen. I'm sorry I said you squealed on me. I was totally out of line, and I really owe you an apology. Did you hear what I said?You know who this is for?That's right, my little friend. Hello. We're going fishing.I'll get it.Well... I'm not really sure why you're here, Ron. I mean, I realize I haven't exactly been a model citizen since I got here, but compared to how things have been goin' for me lately, I thought I was doing pretty well.And I also find it kind of discouraging that you seem to think I need some kind of spiritual counseling or what have you, so much so that you're willing to disregard the fact that I don't believe in any of this stuff at all --I mean it's really kind of insulting.How would she know?I didn't realize I was smiling.Great job you got.Well --You mean -- Like, me personally, my individual life?Well... I'm not sure -- What do you mean? It's important to me. I guess. And like, to my, you know, the people who care about me...I --Well, I don't think... I don't particularly think anybody's life has any particular importance besides whatever -- you know -- whatever we arbitrarily give it. Which is fine. I mean we might as well... I think I'm as important as anybody else...I don't know: A lot of what you're saying has a real appeal to me, Ron. A lot of the stuff they told us when we were kids... But I don't want to believe something or not believe it because I might feel bad. I want to believe it because I think it's true or not... I'd like to think that my life is important... Or that it's connected to something important...Yes. I believe that.So Sammy, what example will you be setting for us tonight?We're not going fishing.I think you should go fishing with Father Ron.Well, I'm not takin' you.I'm not mad at you......I just, you know, after all that religious conversation, I just realized it's probably not so good for him to be spending so much time with someone like me who doesn't believe his life is important in the scheme of things --I'm serious.I would, Sammy, I just don't think it'd be good for him.Yeah... We really shoulda been out here around seven or eight A.M.Two-thirty.Yeah, your father was good at all that stuff. He knew everything about the woods, everything about fishing, everything about hunting and everything about cars. If he wasn't such a pain in the ass he would've been a lot of fun to be around.I doubt it.How would you know? Did you ever meet him?Were you ever curious to meet him?Well, he doesn't live very far from here.No -- I lived in Alaska. Your dad lives in Auburn. Far as I know. We could look him up in the phone book. Wanna try?OK -- But -- I'm sure I don't have to say this, but I'm not kidding, man: Don't -- tell -- your -- mother.Well -- We're right here.Come on.There he is.Yeah. Ring the bell.Hi. We're looking for Rudy?An old friend.Hey, Rudy.Hi, I'm Terry.And this is Rudy.Rudy, meet Rudy.Nice to meet you.OK if we come in for a minute?What do you mean what am I doin' --Well we just wanna --All right, all right.I just wanted the kid to see you --Man, you are really --I just wanna --You know what, man? You're still a fuckin' asshole.I just came down here to talk to the guy and all of a sudden he starts shovin' me!You're a lyin' fuckin' piece of shit.This is such bullshit. He started the whole thing and you're arresting me?You don't have to say anything, Sammy.What do you mean?I don't know how to behave around an eight-year-old?I think you don't know how to behave around an eight-year-old.What do you mean, Get my own place?You mean in Scottsville?Why would I do that? Why don't I just leave, period?Well --No, you know what? I'll just go.I don't know. I just want to get out of this town. And if you've got any sense when you get old enough you'll get out of here too. Your Mom's gonna live in this town for the rest of her life, and you know why? Because she thinks she has to. Don't ask me why, but that's the truth. She thinks there's all these things she has to do, but you want to know one thing about your Mom? She's a bigger fuck- up than I ever was. I mean, I know I messed up. You think I enjoy getting thrown in jail because I wanted you to face that prick your Dad like a little man and see what kind of a guy he is? I know I got a little carried away, and I lost my temper just a little bit -- which is not the end of the world either, by the way, just for future reference --And now she's kickin' me out of my own house because -- you know, because I fucked up a little bit. Which I totally admit. I was like -- totally ready to admit that.Well, thanks, man. But I, uh, I can't really take care of you.Yeah, I'm just gonna stay at Ray's till I take off.Yeah. Well, that's what I wanna do, so --No -- I'm just gonna take off. I'll see you later.Ray's house.No -- I'm leavin' tomorrow.There's a bus at nine.Yeah -- I don't know... I mean --All right, all right. I'll come by in the morning.Yeah -- No -- I'll be there.All right.Hey, how's it goin', man?Sorry I'm late.So Rudy... If I write you a letter, will you write me back?OK, well, that's gonna be pretty nice for you, because I write a pretty Goddamn interesting letter.All right. Well, say good-bye.No, I got a few bucks... Aren't you gonna be late for work?Oh, well, I didn't really have a concrete plan yet. I have to go back to Worcester and get my stuff...Well... Yeah... You know... Thought maybe I'd try to show my face... Let her brother have a crack at me...No...I'm just kidding. I just thought... Just thought I'd check up on her... Anyway, after that, I don't really know. I've been thinking about Alaska a lot. I still got some friends out there. I don't really know. Anyway, I'll write you.Sure, Sammy. Of course I will. You know that.Nothing too bad... But I gotta tell you, I know things didn't work out too well this time......but it's always really good to know that wherever I am, whatever stupid shit I'm doing, you're back at my home, rooting for me.Come on, Sammy. Everything's gonna be all right... Comparatively... And I'll be back this way...Of course you will, Sammy. You never have to worry about that.I do know where I'm going. I'm going to Worcester and I'm gonna try to see that girl. And then depending on what happens there, I thought I'd try to see if there's any work for me out West. And if there is, I'm gonna head out there for the summer and try to make some money. And if there isn't, I'll figure something else out. Maybe I'll stay around the East. I don't know... I really liked it in Alaska. It was really beautiful. You just -- It made me feel good. And before things got so messed up I was doin' pretty well out there. Seriously. But I couldn't stay here long, Sammy: I don't want to live here. But I'm gonna stay in touch. And I'll be back. 'Cause I want to see you and I want to see Rudy. I'll come home for Christmas. How about that? We'll have Christmas together. Come on, Sammy. You can trust me...Come on, Sammy... Look at me... Look at me...Hey, Sammy...
