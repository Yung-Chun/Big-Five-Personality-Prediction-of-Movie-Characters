{"Twin-Peaks": {"DESMOND": {"raw_line": "OK, Gordon.OK, Gordon.Okay, Gordon!!!Smell something fishy, huh?Congratulations. I heard about that.Federal?Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.Sort of shorthand.We're heading into a difficult situation.I'll explain it to you. Do you remember Lil's dance?Lil was wearing a sour face.Her face had a sour look... that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities. They are not going to be receptive to the FBI.Both eyes blinking means there is going to be trouble higher up... the eyes of the local authority. A sheriff and a deputy. That would be my guess. Two of the local law enforcers are going to be a problem.Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?Very good, but I can't tell you about that.What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.He talks loud. And he loves his code.Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.Good afternoon, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to see Sheriff Cable.Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.You can start that FRESH pot of coffee right now.Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond.Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.Well, little fella, let me put it this way. The operative word here would be \"Federal\". With or without the semantics of all this, I am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning Teresa Banks, both while living and deceased.That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.Teresa Banks lived at the Canyon Trailer Park for a month. We'll check that. And worked as a waitress at Hap's Truck Stop. Worked the Night Shift. Good place for dinner when we're thru here, Sam. No one came to claim the body and no known next of kin.That's what I heard.That's good.I don't know, Sam.Sure, but let's finish up with this first.Cole said she was 17.Yeah. Personal effects include a watch, under garments, and a blue waitress uniform... the ring is missing. It says the rest of her things haven't been removed yet from the trailer. Let's hope it's there.Oh.Accidental?What is it?We're not. You and I are going to get some food.Where's Hap?Sorry to hear it.I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa BanksAny friends?Ever see her with someone else?Did she ever mention any friends?How come Jack let's you work here?Say no more.Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her. How well?What happened to her?Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?Do you take cocaine, Irene?He's with me. Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?Thanks.You have something to tell us?What?What time is it, Stanley?It's late, Sam.What do you mean?Thanks.I think that's a good idea.I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.Did she have someone with her?Was there an argument?Yes they do. Did she have visitors?She must have known someone.Take a look at this.My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.Did you know Teresa Banks?What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?Did you know Teresa Banks?No you couldn't.Is there a golf course around here?Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.He's not the murderer. But he's a bozo.We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?Sam, get the body and put it in the van. Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?I don't take it, Sam. I give it.I think I'll take off my badge as well.This one's comin' from J. Edgar.Who's next?Take the van back to Portland, Stanley. I'm going to take one more look at the trailer park.Faulty wiring.Thanks, Sam, for the good work.

I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.A blue rose.What did Gordon's tie mean?Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?I see. He does talk loud.It must be a high priority situation.You know, Agent Desmond, I figure this whole office, furniture included, is worth 27,000 dollars.Solved the Whiteman Case with this.No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.Yes, it is good. What do you think is in these other drawers?Maybe, later we could take a look.Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.I wonder where her ring is?There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.A laceration.Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.It is a piece of paper with the letter \"T\" imprinted on it. Take a look.Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?Nicotine is a drug. Caffeine is a drug.You think we ought to question him?Oh...Agent Desmond, it's...It's not late, it's early. Really early.I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.Are you speaking to me in a code?In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.Thank god it is morning.Nine's really late. We are really early.She lived alone.I'll get my kit.5,600 dollars.She's wearing a ring.May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond? There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.We really do need a good \"wake me up\", don't we, Agent Desmond? We really do need a good \"wake me up\", don't we, Agent Desmond?I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?Yes, he is like a clown.When he says, \"Discussion\", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond? I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.We do notice things, don't we, Agent Desmond? Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose?83,000 dollars.Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.Oh, alright. You know, I liked Agent Desmond. He had his own M.O.I cracked the Whiteman case with this.No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.Take a look at this.
