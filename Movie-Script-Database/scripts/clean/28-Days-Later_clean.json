Who were... who...I'm a bicycle courier. I was riding a package from Farringdon to Shaftesbury Avenue. A car cut across me... and then I wake up in hospital, today... I wake up and I'm hallucinating, or...Jim.Where are your families?No... No! I'm going to find them. They live in Greenwich. I can walk. I'm going to... to go and...Yes! I'll go and come back.Down there. Westlink Street. Second on the left.I understand.I understand.I'm not grateful.My old room was at the end of the landing. You two take it. I'll sleep down here.It's empty.Help!It's Mr. Bridges...He lives four doors down...That's his daughter...No... No! I wasn't!No!I... I don't know. I think so.How did you know?How did you know he was infected?The blood was everywhere. On me, on you, and...How long had you known him?Let's hope we don't have to get out of here in a hurry.No. You?I do need a break, by the way.Nothing.I've got a headache.Pretty bad.Because I didn't think you'd give a shit....Do you have Sprite?Jesus!I can't.I'm Jim.This is your place, then.It's nice.There aren't any others in the building?Yes. Fine.It's fine.I'll take the living room.Good night, Frank.Very shredded.So what do you make of them?...I think they're good people.Yeah.Right. Because if they slowed you down...In a heartbeat.I wouldn't.Selena - you think I don't get it. But I do get it. And I know I'd be dead already if I hadn't met you.No, look - I mean thank you.Good night.Morning.They're all empty...Right.It's a recording?The North...Maybe they've got a cure.Get there how?Then we should go the indirect route. The one in broad daylight. That isn't underground.I knew this was a shit idea. You know why? Because it was really obviously a shit idea. Driving into a dark tunnel, full of smashed cars and broken glass is really fucking obviously a shit idea.Oh no.The world's worst place to get a flat....You heard that?Holy shit.Fuck you!You're getting out?Wait!It's okay. I think you can eat this stuff raw.It isn't any crap. It's whisky. It might be good to have.Jesus Christ. We're never going to be able to get out of London.Nice cut-through....What?We don't have any cheeseburgers. \"Stay close.\" It's like going on holiday with your fucking aunt.No.Who's unbelievably hungry?Let's have a picnic.These are great. They're like huge biscuits.I said, the raisins are still moist.You know what I was thinking?That's what you were thinking.About what?That's what I was thinking.Uh-huh. You stole my thought.(slightly surprised, butNor can I. It doesn't feel safe, outdoors like this.I know. I noticed that too. (reaching over and shakingHow did you manage to get to sleep?Valium. Great. Not only will it get us to sleep, but if we get attacked during the night, we won't even care. Two each?What about...?Fuck you!What...(mumbled, half-asleepHere you go, Frank. This is how you catch dew. I'm covered in the fucking stuff.Bloody hell...But, the whole of Manchester. The whole city...It can't be...Try the horn.It looks deserted.They didn't all leave.Yes.We were hoping for...I didn't know what to imagine, so... We just feel lucky to have found you.You're keeping him alive?And has he?...So how is she?Hey, don't...do that. Look, Hannah... Hannah's what Frank said she was. Tough. Strong. And just like me, just like you, she will cope...Cut it out!Look. We're grateful. Very grateful for your protection, and just to have found other people. But if we're going to stay here with you, you're going to have to stop your men from -I haven't killed anyone.A boy. I killed a boy.Yes.What?Get up. Get up!We've got to get out of here!We're leaving. Now! NOW!... Quarantine?Hannah! Selena!That was longer than a heartbeat.Listen to me. I've got to tell you - I've got to tell you. The world isn't fucked. It's going to be okay.

You've come from a hospital.He's not a doctor. He's a patient.It began as rioting. And right from the beginning, you knew something bad was going on because the rioters were killing people. And then it wasn't on the TV anymore. It was in the street outside. It was coming through your windows. We all guessed it was a virus. An infection. You didn't need a doctor to tell you that. It was the blood.Yours will be dead too.You'll go and come back.If there's anyone in there who isn't human...Anyone.They died peacefully. You should be grateful.We don't have time to get back to the shop before dark. We should stay here tonight.We'll sleep in the same room. It's safer.Were you bitten?Were you bitten?Did any of the blood get in your mouth?Mark?Get that cleaned off.Do you have any clothes here?Then get them. And get dressed. We have to leave, now.More infected will be coming. They always do.The blood.I didn't know he was infected. Okay? I didn't know. He knew. I could see it in his face. You need to understand, if someone gets infected, you've got somewhere between ten and twenty seconds to kill them. They might be your brother or your sister or your oldest friend. It makes no difference Just so as you know, if it happens to you, I'll do it in a heartbeat.Five days. Or six. Does it matter?He was full of plans. Long-distance weapons, so they don't get close. A newsagent's with a metal grill, so you can sleep. Petrol bombs, so the blood doesn't splash.Got a plan yet, Jim? You want us to find a cure and save the world? Or fall in love and fuck?Plans are pointless. Staying alive is as good as it gets.Shhh.Need a break?No.What's up?Bad?Why didn't you say something before?You've got no fat on you, and all you've had to eat is sugar. So you're crashing. Unfortunately, there isn't a lot we can do about that......except pump you full painkillers, and give you more sugar to eat.As for the sugar: Lilt or Tango?Actually, I did have a can of Sprite, but...Quiet.That's an infected.They're in.Come on!Let us in!Selena.Shall we?We're grateful.And you haven't seen any people outside?Didn't come back.It's a good set-up.Very spruce.Uh-huh.They're desperate. Probably need us more than we need them.Good people?Well, that's nice. But you should be more concerned about whether they're going to slow you down.I'd leave them behind.Yeah.Then you're going to wind up getting yourself killed.I'm going to get some sleep.Sure.And I mean sure. Good night, Jim.There haven't been any broadcasts for weeks.Soldiers.We.I wasn't -If it's a recording, for all we know the soldiers who made it are dead.And that stuff about the answer to infection. There is no answer to infection. It's already done pretty much all the damage it can.Maybe they've got nothing at all.We could die trying.It's the most direct route to the other side of the river.They're running from the infected.(straining with theWhoa!

If I never see chocolate again, it'll be too soon.Not counting Terry's Chocolate Orange, of course.Or Yorkies, obviously.We could have a problem here.Stay close, Jim.You heard.Where are you going?We've got enough food.Find anything.Find anything, Jim?Oh my God, yes. I can taste the vitamin C. I can feel it in my blood.You were thinking that you'll never hear another piece of original music ever again. You'll never read a book that isn't already written. Or see a film that isn't already shot.No... I was thinking I was wrong.All the death, all the shit - it doesn't really mean anything for Frank and Hannah. Because she's got her dad, and he's got his daughter, so... it's okay.I was wrong when I told you that staying alive is as good as it gets....Was it?Sorry.What... what is it...I didn't need a prescription. I'm a qualified chemist.No fire crews to put it out.Don't. We might attract the wrong kind of attention.Or overrun.I don't like this. I think we should go.Frank.Yes.Jim...

She's only fourteen!You need to give me a moment with Hannah.

Good to meet you. And this is my daughter, Hannah. ...Come on, sweetheart. Say hello.So... so this is great. Just great. It calls for a celebration.Yes, her creme de menthe. Great. Look, sit, please. Get comfortable. Sit tight while I get it.Where are the bloody glasses?No! The good ones! This is a celebration!There! I know it isn't much but... well, cheers!Normally we keep the windows covered at night, because the light attracts them. But when we saw your petrol station fire, we knew it had to be survivors... So we hooked up the Christmas tree lights. Like a beacon.Well, we're grateful you came. I was starting to really worry. Like I say, we haven't seen any sign of anyone normal for a while now.We haven't left the block for more than two weeks. Stayed right here. Only sensible thing to do. Everyone who went out...And there's two hundred flats here. Most of them have a few cans of food, or cereal, or something.It isn't bad.We've got by, haven't we?You okay in there, Jim?Sorry we couldn't spare the water but... it's the same with the toilet. The, er, flush doesn't work. I'm afraid you have to use the bucket.Have to empty it each morning. We just chuck it over the balcony... No mod cons here....Well, look, it's pretty late. I'm going to turn in. We've got a spare room. Are you and Selena...?Oh, right. I mean, yes... So, good night then, anyway.Morning, Jim.Listen, have you got a minute?We lost water pressure three weeks ago. For a while, I thought we'd be okay with the water in the other flats. The cistern and tanks. But it vanishes so quick you wouldn't believe. You drink it, it evaporates, turns stagnant...It hasn't rained in over a week.You can set up a plastic sheet to catch dew and condensation. Trap it somehow. I saw it on TV once and I've been experimenting, but I can't get it to work, and... you don't happen to...You'd never think it. Needing rain so badly... Not in fucking England... Jim, we don't have enough water for and Selena.No. It's not what you think.Just listen.There's more. Listen.Then it just repeats.It's a recording. But this is where it's telling us to go.The way things are, we might need two or three days to get up there.Sound carries in this flat. Jerry- built, I suppose, and... me and Hannah do need you more than you need us.It's okay. Look, it's the truth. I can't leave the block if it's just the two of us.Yes. It's possible.The only way to find out is to reach them.Just so as you know. I don't take cheques or credit cards.What do you think?Let's just get it done.HOLD ON!Fuck.Agreed. I think we'd better do this quick.You know what to do.(from the front of the(as the rats rush aroundHannah, get out, get out! Just lift it! LIFT IT!Go! Go!Honey, you're a cab driver's daughter.Mmm.
