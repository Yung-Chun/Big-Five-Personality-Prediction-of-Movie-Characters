Morning of their exam, I...I was going to ask you.Hello.Science?Cosmologist. I'm a cosmologist.It's a kind of religion--for intelligent atheists. You're not religious, are you?- England. I suppose someone has to be.A single unifying equation that explains everything in the universe.That is the question.My finals papers were such a shambles the examiners called me in for a 'Viva' and I told them -A mildly terrifying face-to-face thingy. An interrogation. So I told them that if they gave me a 2nd class degree I'd stay with them and do my research at Oxford, but if they gave me the 1st I needed to get into Cambridge, then they'd never have to see me again.They gave me the 1st.Morning, Brian.Brian, I have no idea what you're talking about.None.I was going do them later.Yes.Bri-?Can you whip on some Wagner?Sorry.Sorry. It's on the back. Had a little accident.I could only do nine.Full, give me twenty - One, drive! - Two, drive! - Three, big legs! - Four, press! - Five, boom! - Hook, send! - Catch, big send! - Hold at 32! - Big legs, Brian! - Big legs!- Stay long, Brian! - Stay long Brian!!!...He was too short to reach the button for the fiftieth floor.Do you have change for the pay- phone?Uh - my napkin just walked in.Hi.What's the probability?Croquet. Do you play croquet?Sunday morning?Oh. Of course. Him.I can't decide.Umm-- No.Once upon a time.I have a problem with the whole Celestial Dictator premise. What are you doing for lunch? Ma makes a cracking roast.Don't touch it, don't touch it Jane.Positively saintly, thank you.A physicist can't allow his calculations to be muddled by a belief in a supernatural creator.I'll wing it. As usual.Stop egging him on!Oh! - I'm inviting Jane to be my partner for the May Ball.Will you?Oh, no, no. Happy to observe the phenomenon--but I can't possibly imagine participating.No, I'm quite serious. I don't dance.Do you see how the men's cuffs and shirt-fronts, how they glow more than the dresses?Do you know why?\"TIDE.\"The fluorescence in the washing powder is caught by the UV light.When stars are born and when they die, they emit UV radiation. So if we could see the night sky in ultraviolet light, almost all the stars would disappear--and all we'd see would be these spectacular births and deaths. And I reckon-- it would look a little -So why... ...why...Why medieval Spanish poetry?And what particular time periods do you visit?The roaring twenties! Cheers!So--The 1920's. A good time for poetry was it?Ouch.A smashing time actually. Spacetime was born.Space and Time finally got together. People always thought they were too dissimilar, couldn't possibly work out. But then along comes Einstein, the ultimate match- maker, and decided that space and time, not only had a future, but had been married all along.Well that's astonishing, isn't it?Would you dance with me?I wonder what would happen--if--I wonder what would happen--If you applied Penrose's theory about black holes to--the entire universe?If--if--so--If--Einstein is right, if--general relativity is correct, then the universe is expanding, yes? -- which means - that--if you reverse time, the universe would get smaller and smaller. So what if--if I reverse the process all the way to see what happened at the beginning of Time itself? The universe, smaller and smaller, denser and denser, hotter and hotter as we approach its birth. Wind back the clock...What are you doing?Is that what you're doing?Well keep winding! You've got quite a way to go. Keep winding, Jane! Keep winding...back to the beginning of Time...Keep winding......until you get -A spacetime singularity. At the beginning of time.The universe born from a black hole exploding.Keep going? You mean go further back, Professor? Before the universe began?I don't know how.What is it? What's wrong with me?What's that?Is--is--is there a cure? Some--? Is--can you--?Wait! What about--what about the brain?What?I have a disease, Bri.No. Motor neuron disease. Lou Gehrig's Disease. He was a baseball player.I have two years to live. Sounds strange, doesn't it, when you say it out loud.Will you leave me Brian?Very.John is having an affair with Martha. But Martha is in love with Alan. And I think Alan is homosexual by the look of his shirts. I'm trying to work out the mathematical probability of happiness.It's some integer of zero, but I'm not there yet.You just missed him. He was here earlier.What?Go.I believe you poetry under- graduate types call it...\"a slough of despond.\"My turn.Go away.Go away!There's nothing to say-- just...That's what I want. I haven't got time for you. So - if you care about me at all - go.I've got two years. I need to work.You've--you've leapt to--a false conclusion...You don't realise what's coming. It'll affect everything.Yes. It is.Time!Time.Fine.No thankyou.Thankyou.Prove it. Prove...with a single equation, that Time has a beginning. Wouldn't that be nice Professor? One single elegant equation to explain everything?I'm sorry.It's okay Robert.This--is--temporary.Well, it's convenient for breakfast!Thank you.I said--thankyou.Go Jane.JANE?I've got an idea. I've got an idea Jane!...allowing us to predict that some particles can in fact escape a black hole. Black holes aren't black at all, but glow with heat radiation.In other words--the steady emission of heat energy causes black holes to slowly lose mass, they evaporate, eventually disappearing in a spectacular explosion. So...- it must eventually disappear.First a star vanishes into a black hole, but then the black hole must itself--vanish. THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 45Was it something I said?Big legs! Big legs Brian!What?Different system. Automatic.No doctors!(forcefully, but with aRobert--your mother's very angry at me.Yes, a magazine subscription.Pent-house. That way even if I'm wrong, I still win!That was my - PhD thesis.My new project - disproves it.What one believes - - is irrelevant--in physics.No. Mine.Very good.Tits up.Seems he not only plays dice -- he throws them - where we can't find them.But physics--is back in business.It's the final--challenge. We'll know everything.Wrong guy to ask. THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 62I understand you need more help. And if there is - someone - who is prepared to offer it - I won't object, as long - as long as you continue to love me.We have help.Can't afford--live-in nurse.For black holes--not rock concerts.I've just been invited -Geneva.Students can accompany me.I know how much you hate -- to fly.I was thinking - that you and the CHILDREN -could bring the car -- meet me in Bayreuth -Bring Jonathan.Is--this okay?Jane--needs--help.See you - in Bayreuth.My--name--is--Stee--ven--Hawking.Daisy. Daisy. Give Me Your Answer Do.Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.Ex-terminate..! Ex-terminate..! Ex-terminate..!I will write. A Book.Time...What is the nature of Time?Will it ever come to an end?Can we go back in time?Some day these answers may seem as obvious to us as the earth orbiting the sun, or perhaps as ridiculous as a tower of tortoises.Only Time, whatever that may be, will tell.It is for a friend.So I said - I have long been looking for a model of the universe. I finally found her.Yes. Of course.HOWEVER --You - are - welcome.E-laine has offered to travel with me to A-merica. She will look after me.Don't worry.A-nother a-ward. What can you do?Everything will be okay.How many years?Be. Happy.I cannot sign copies of my book-- but if you like--I could drive over it.Can you hear me? There are some things I cannot do. But. They are mostly the things I don't particularly want to do anyway.I was stopped recently by a tourist in Cambridge who asked if I was 'the real Stephen Hawking.' I replied that I was not, and said the real one was--much better looking.He believed me.I now predict -- that I was wrong.I have experimental evidence that Time Travel is not possible. I gave a party for Time-Travellers but no- one came.It is clear that we are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies......but--ever since the dawn of civilisation, people have craved for an understanding of the underlying order of the world. There ought to be something very special about the boundary conditions of the universe - and what can be more special than that there is no boundary? And there should be no boundary to human endeavour. We are all different. There is no such thing as a standard or run of the mill human being--but we share the same human spirit.

THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 56None of that wishy-washy do-gooder stuff--Matthew, Luke.Well I should be going.Absolutely. My husband loves music too.Well, that's a long story. 'Night.Water.PhD thesis....in physics.Stephen's done a U-turn. The big new idea is that the universe has no boundaries at all. No boundaries, no beginning. No BEGINNING -Stephen is looking for a single law that governs all the forces in the universe. So God must die.The two great pillars of physics ARE - - Quantum Theory, the laws that govern the very small--electrons, particles so on--and General Relativity......Einstein's theory. Which governs the very large, planets and such--but Quantum - AND - Relativity...They don't remotely play by the same rules. Peas are chaotic, and don't behave predictably at all -Which you can set your watch by.If the world were all potatoes, easy--you could trace a precise beginning, as Stephen once did, a moment of Creation. Hallelujah, God lives.But if you want to incorporate peas into the menu, which Stephen now wants to do, then it all goesTits up. Haywire. Becomes a Godless mess.Einstein hated peas, Quantum Theory. \"God doesn't play dice with the universe\", he said.Seems he not only plays dice -- he throws them -Stephen's swapped his telescope - for a microscope. Order for chaos--hoping to find a law to cover both.God is back on the endangered species list.Physics is back in business. Stephen thinks it a fair exchange.(to JONATHAN, ignoringWe'll know everything.Thank you for coming.Of course. For infinity.I have to tell you something.I'm um--I'm pregnant.Does it make a difference?No. I don't.Know what?!That's what you think of me?There is no way that Timothy could have any other father than Stephen. None. And for the record--I will never leave Stephen.Please don't go.So. What does it matter?I have feelings for you, too.Invited? Where?Geneva?What students?You know how much I hate -To fly. Yes.- Me and the children--go on?- bring the car -Bayreuth? How can I manage that? On my own?I doubt he would be willing.And please please remember, 5 milligrams of Riluzole before and after the flight.Travel safely.Forty-nine...Fifty. Coming ready or not!What are you talking about?Stephen must live! You have to bring him round from the anaesthetic!There's no question. Stephen must live. I will see he gets everything he needs. I will have him transferred back to Cambridge.Drive--safely, yes? Did you get everything in the car? His chair, equipment...Stephen?This is a Spelling Board. First, you tell me what letter you want by blinking when I say the colour of the group that contains that letter. Once I know the group, you can choose the character inside that group by blinking again when I go through the colours of each letter in that group. Apparently. Okay? Let's just try.So...Green, Yellow, Blue, White, Black, Red. Blink to choose the group that contains the letter you want? Green? Yellow? Blue? White? Black? Red?She's here. Okay.

Are there any other voices?At four words a minute? About what?TIME.Elaine? Can we - ?Would you mind if I spoke with Stephen alone for a moment?\"Who are we? Why are we here? If we ever learn this, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason, for then we would know the mind of God.\" 'GOD'?

I did my best.He wants to marry her.I'm trying hard not to think of this as a failure.But it feels like it! It feels like it, Mum. Was it inevitable?He's gone back to looking for his Theory Of Everything, his single equation. Well, it'll have to explain human relationships too.It's going to have to be a wonderful piece of mathematics. All the accidents...And vice versa.Then add Time - Adversity -- until the situation becomes unstable, heats up.And the whole thing starts over. Whole new galaxies.It's from Stephen. He's--he has invited--the children and I--to accompany him.Your glasses are always dirty.I'll leave a card. There's a number you can call. They can install ramps in a day.
