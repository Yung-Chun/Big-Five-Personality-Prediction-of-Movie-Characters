{"Frozen-River": {"RAY": {"raw_line": "Just give him toast.Listening for the trucks.Yeah.I don't know how he found it, T.J.I locked it in my glove compartment.Yeah, I see that now, but the trucks were coming before the bank opened.Duh? No, I guess he just sniffed it out.He hasn't bought a scratch card in almost thirty two months. I thought it would be okay!Nothing.He could be anywhere.Where?With more than four thousand dollars, he's probably in Atlantic City by now.I can't.I just can't do it anymore.T.J., we can't make him stop.It's not stealing if you take it from your family. Anyway, he made some of it, too.I'm sorry.Hey, little sleepy head.Wait a sec-We're all ready for ya'.We have it, it's just that they called Troy from Titus last night. That's where Troy works. The ski place? And anyway-It was some emergency with the lifts. So he took off without thinking with the money. Completely forgot you were coming. So as soon as he gets back-As soon as he can get here, I'll just run it down to you.Look, Mr. Versales, I have a good job at ALL FOR A DOLLAR. They're probably gonna make me a manager after Christmas so I can handle the payments if you just leave the house-I'll call you...Listen to me. We'll get them back.Ricky, I'll get them back. I promise, honey.We're gonna get it back.You better hurry or you're going to miss the bus. Let's get your clothes on, Ricky.You're 15, T.J.You're finishing school.You're going to school.He'll be back.No! I'm going to work and you're going to school.The only thing that changed is that your dad started gambling again. Everything else is the same.He had to take a business trip.And miss a day of work? No. Not again. We just have to live our lives. Now go get your backpack.Go on!I don't know, Ricky.Where? Where do I look?I told you, he could be in Atlantic City by now.You're going to school.Wait, wait.Here. Lunch money.Matt. Could I talk to you?I need to come on full-time.What is that?When I started you said it would be six months before I could come on full-time. And that was two years ago.Well, I mean, you know, I do show up. Pat's late everyday. She's late now. She's always late.See ya' tomorrow.Just three...uh, no...two seventy one, two, three, four.Make that seven seventy four.Did you see a Blue Acclaim come in here last night?No, that's okay.Thank you. Oh God, thank you, thank you thank you...You son of a bitch!I just need to look inside.I don't want to play, I just need to look around for a second.I'll stand right here at the door. I won't even go inside. I just need to see if my husband's in there.He's gambling away the money for our house.Long brown hair. Tall. Skinny. Ponytail.Can I just look?Hey!That's my car.What are you doing with my car?You stole it.So you just took it...?We'll just see what the troopers say about that.You can cut the bullshit and give me my keys now.Troy, are you in there?If you're in there you better come out.Troy? Versales says as long as we get the money in by Christmas we won't lose the deposit. I think we need to talk about this, so come on out. Troy? Troy?I'm not kidding, honey, come on out.This is New York State so quit the bullshit and give me my damn keys!Then you should quit stealing cars.Did you see where the bus was headed?Shit!I'm not leaving this here.It's not for sale.Why's that?Does he use them to rob banks or something?Where does he live?What's in it for you?If you try anything, I'm not afraid to use this.Where?There's no road.I'm not crossing that!That's Canada.What about the border patrol?I'm still not crossing that.This is so fuckin' stupid.What's going on here?Twelve hundred.Wait, who the fuck are they?I'm not moving until those people get out of my trunk.I'm not taking them over the border. That's a crime.This isn't a nation.Fuck you.What if the troopers stop us.Twelve hundred.You can't have my car.You can't have my car.No!Fuckin' bitch!Little bitch!I told you not to use that thing when I'm not here.I don't care. Don't use that thing when I'm not here!No.At the bus stop on the Rez.You don't know that.And then what? Chase him across the country. Miss work. No.Nothin'.It was no big deal.Some Indian chick tried to steal your Dad's car.It doesn't matter.I'll get it tomorrow.I didn't have a tow rope.Forget it T.J. Did you and Ricky eat?There's food.They're gonna flatten it out and send it to China.They're gonna melt it down and make little toys out if it.They'll send them back here so I can sell them at All for a Dollar.That's right.We just have to make it to my paycheck on Friday.What about them?You told me that already.Here, lunch money.Who's Mitch.He sells pot to kids?You're fifteen, it's not gonna happen so forget it.Your job is looking after your brother. Who's gonna take care of him?I want my part.You hear me!I want my part.I want my part.No way.Then I wanna get some more of those Chinese.I just need enough for the balloon payment on my doublewide then I'm out of this. I'm no criminal.You people can call it what you want to. I just want my double.Suit yourself.Three. I got kids.Five and Fifteen.Stole him?Stole him?What's going on?Where?Where's that?What the hell is he doing?What the hell is going on here?Twelve hundred.Why would they want to run?What's that?How much does it cost?To get here?To get here? No fuckin' way.God those are ripe.Are they always there?Have you ever gotten caught?What happened?What did you do?Smuggling?Right, I know.Then why don't you count it?You're welcome.We're even now.It's okay. I got it right here. . Two fifty five, right?Who wants to go the Price Chopper and get some Cap'n Crunch?Wanna to go to the Price Chopper?Matt made me an assistant manager.Is that so hard to believe?Exactly, and that's why he gave me a bonus.Do you wanna go to the Price Chopper or not?What?What is it, again?-Hot Wheels Tech Trax, what?I got something even better than that.The double wide. But don't mention it to Ricky, just in case.This time is for real.Yes it is. We're getting a tub, T.J. It's gonna happen.If you keep that attitude I'll never let you use it.What about him?Why, did he call broke yet?Oh, here we go again with Saint Dad.He's an addict, T.J.You gotta help Ricky get the tree up tomorrow after school okay?Christmas shopping.Hi....it's me...leave a message and I'll call ya' back.Hey, leave me a message and I'll call ya' back. You son of a bitch.Hi, it's me. I can't take the call right now, but if it's you, Troy, please at least tell me you are alive, because the boys are worried about you.That's $87.50.Sorry. Didn't go through.I can try to put it though again.That'll be three seventy six.I gotta get back before KMART closes.I got nothing for under the tree.Don't you people even take Christmas Eve off?You could fool me the way they were all lined up at All for a Dollar today.From what?That's awful not to have Santa Claus-- for the kids, I mean.Wait. They're not Chinese.What does that mean?Well where's that?A big difference.Look, I'm not driving just anybody across the border.I wanna know what's in the bag.What's in there?Well, if they want to come over here so bad, they ought'a take the time to learn English.Just hold on a second.I'll take that.I just hope these aren't the ones that blow up themselves and everybody with them.A five.Shit!I'm not stoppin'.Nuclear power, poison gas,...you can't tell what they might have in there. I'm not gonna be responsible for that.-Hi, I'm gonna be a little late. -I have to work. Is Ricky asleep? -Put him on. -Ricky listen to me, he's not coming until you go to sleep.-No. Not yet. He's still flyin' over Canada okay? He's not even done with Canada yet, so he's not coming until you get to sleep. Now put your brother on. -I'll be home in a little while, okay? -No, I haven't got it,yet. What's it called again? -Hot Wheels Tech Trax Air Stunt whatever, right, right, I'll get it if I can! -I can't promise T.J. -There are more important things to get for Christmas this year. Be home in a little while. Okay, bye.You'd think a new house would be enough.It was too heavy. We had to unload it.What's the matter with her!?What is she saying!?It didn't feel like there was anything in that bag.I can't believe they put their baby in a duffle bag.If you'd let me search it I would never have taken it-I know! I know that.Where?Come on!Tap the bottom of his feet.That's what they did to get Ricky breathing when he was born.Well, I can't hold it and drive.At least put him next to your body. That will warm him up.Just do it! We can't give it back to her cold.Shit!Oh shit. What do I do?What if he saw us go by before. To Bob's.What if he searches the car. What do we say about-I wasn't speeding, was I?Did I do something?Okay.Oh, I didn't know.Thanks.She looks after my kids when I have to work late.Yeah, you, too.Just a blown out tail light.Yeah.We gotta take it in.What is it?What? Are you sure?He was just cold.We found him.Come on. Let's go.He was just cold.Okay, whatever, you brought him back to life.All I know is Kmart is closed and I got nothing for under the tree.What?Look, I don't have time for that. I can't get deep about every little thing. I just have to keep on going. I only need one more run to have enough for my double.Here.Merry Christmas or whatever.What's that?Where'd you get it?Mitch? Is that the friend you called? It's probably stolen, you know.Well, I don't want you hanging around him. That kid is bad news.Look , Mister, I got more important things to worry about than toys. I'm trying to get our doublewide.Hey, you can lose the attitude. Anyway, Kmart was closed by the time I got off work.What's that smell?I told you to be careful with the microwave, didn't I?Yes.I haven't gotten the light fixed-Sure.Yes.Not too long. She looks after my kids.Really?Wow. That's a shock.Yeah, I've heard about it but I didn't know she was involved.Uh, I think there was a sign for a baby sitter at the Wolf Mart. That's where I get my gas.Oh my God.Absolutely.Thanks. You, too.T.J. could you come out here for a minute.No.Did you have a fire last night?You fixed um?Did you happen to use the blow torch?Look at this. We can't live here anymore!No, it was our house.Jesus, you could have killed yourself and your brother.Put it down.Put it down.Put that thing down!That was an accident.He spent the food money on scratch cards, T.J.Gimme that thing.T.J. come on now.He was clean for 23 months.I didn't know how else to keep us together. I mean...he's a good dad when he's not gamblin'.I know.That's okay. I still wanna buy a ticket.I got money.I just want to buy some scratch cards.T.J. set the trailer on fire.He didn't mean to, but the pipes froze and he got that damn torch out -- which I told him not to do touch when I wasn't there -- and he tried to thaw them out-There's a hole in my bedroom floor. We gotta move.I just need one more run to get the double.Look you can have the Acclaim. Okay?What is it then?!Are you still mad about that baby? `Cause it wasn't all my fault, ya' know. I mean who puts their kid in a duffle bag?You're gonna need a lot of money to take care of a one year old baby.Yeah, but you gotta get him first.I'll help you. You can even borrow my gun.You should see the inside.Three. And it's got a jacuzzi tub in the master bathroom.Oh yeah. But the best thing is the insulation. The pipes can never freeze.I'll be back.I wanna schedule a delivery.It's three thousand but I want it delivered tomorrow.Take it as a deposit. All you have to do is show up. If I don't have the rest you keep it.Have you ever been there?No, Troy didn't like to travel. He liked to work in his shed, mostly.Can't miss that.Okay. We'll take them.Just open the trunk.Turn around!I want the rest.Go get it.No. But thanks.Put it there.He shot me.I'm tired of people stealing from me. Is it all there?Just COUNT IT and make sure it's all there!Is it there?Good.I can't.How much farther to the reservation?What the hell? We're on the reservation.Shit!Will it hold us?I gotta go.No. You stay here.I thought this was all legal on the reservation.Look, I gotta get home.But, she's a Mohawk.Listen, my kids got no one but me.At least you got family to take care of him, ya' know?It's just a few months, right?I got baby stuff in the shed.Get a good used single wide with insulation. Insulation is the key thing. Versailles will give you a hard time, but that will leave enough for you and the boys to live on for a couple of months. Ricky's allergic to penicillin. And you can't feed `em Pringles all the time. Okay?Okay?But you gotta get there quick, before the police, `cause T.J. will get scared. I don't want him to get scared, you know.And don't let him jerk you around. Versailles, I mean. Go with her. Okay?How long is it for me. You know if I confess?Will they get sent back?Can I have a cigarette?I got somebody.A friend.But I need to call my kid.Hi, You've reached Ray.

Not far.He'll give me something for finding it.Yeah.Turn up there.Where that stump is.There's a path.It's not far.Not too fast. There's ruts.Don't worry they already put out the Christmas trees. There's no black ice.No, it's Mohawk land. The Rez is on both sides of the river.There's no border.Don't worry, it'll hold a Plymouth. I've seen semis cross it.The only other way is the Cornwall bridge and they won't let you take that. .They plow it and everything.Not too fast, there are ruts.You gotta pick up some speed to get up the bank.It's just on the other side of those trees.Honk the horn.Just keep your mouth shut.Just keep it shut.

I froze last night.It's not a crime.I don't usually work with whites.How many bedrooms?How old?I got a boy. Almost one.He lives with my mother-in-law. She stole him from me.Yeah. Right out of the hospital.Tribal police don't get involved in stuff like that.Thanks.Don't worry about it.Okay.We gotta pick them up.Not far.An old casino through the woods. They used to have gambling there in the bootlegger days.Keep that thing down.Roll down the window and see what he wants.Just roll it down.Count it.Open it.To get away from the snakeheads.The snakeheads pay to get them here and then they gotta work off what they owe .Forty, fifty thousand. Depends where they're coming from.Sometimes they gotta work for years to pay it off.They always stink.Yeah, but they can't stop you unless you give them a reason.Once.They gave me the choice of paying a fine or spending three months in jail.I paid the fine. I made the money back in two nights of smuggling. But back then it was cigarettes and everybody did it. Some of the troopers were into it, too.Yeah.
