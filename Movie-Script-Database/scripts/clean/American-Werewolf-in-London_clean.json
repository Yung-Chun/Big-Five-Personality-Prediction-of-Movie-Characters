{"American-Werewolf-in-London": {"DAVID": {"raw_line": "Thanks again!Yes.Jack.You're not having a good time are you?Well, I like it here.Right.I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.She's a jerk.I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.I don't know.If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.I assume full responsibility.Shall we?Hello.It's very cold outside. May we come in?Well, do you have any coffee?Listen, at least it's warm in here.What about it?Maybe the owners are from Texas.He was joking. Thank you.Oh, yes, of course.You ask them.I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.Wrong. The drinkers have gotten the Chess Player to tell the joke as everyone knew he would.You ask them.Jack, we'd better go.Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!How much do we owe you?Uh, thank you.Yes, well, thanks again.I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.Come on, I'm freezing.That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.Well, not quite a blood- thirsty mob.I have no idea.I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly. There is a flash of lightning that sends a ghostly illuminating sheet of light over the boys' faces. The clap of thunder follows loud and rumbling.Please don't rain.Of course.I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.I heard that.Could be a lot of things.A coyote.The Hound of the Baskervilles.Heathcliffe.No, but he was on the moors.Yeah.We're lost.I don't know. Come on.Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.It's moving.What's the plan?Let's just keep walking.That's right, a lovely stroll in the moors. Tra-la-la, isn't this fun?It's in front of us.A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.Walk away, Jack.See anything?It sounds far away.Jack?Where are we going?Well. I'm glad we...WHOAA!!Are you going to help me up?Jack? Oh my God, Jack!Jack....Jack?!Where am I?London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?What?Ow, shit!Jack's dead?Everything's in order? What are you talking about?You don't crate and ship Jack like some side of beef. Who the hell are you people? What's going on here? Where is Jack? I demand to see him!Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?How long have I been here?Two weeks?Lunatic?It wasn't a lunatic.It was a wolf.A wolf.I'm sorry if I conflict with your report, but Jack and I were not attacked by a man.There were witnesses?How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere...I don't understand what they're talking about.Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.I was having a nightmare.What time is it?Alex?What are you going to see?Do you have bad dreams, too?Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?Yes?I'm not very hungry, thank you.Please, really. I'm not hungry.How is that?Leave the pills. I'll take them later.Aw come on, Miss Price!Aw come on, Alex!Call me David.This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.Will you give me a break?May I have a glass of milk?Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.Did you see Jack?Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.You really think I'm crazy, don't you?Dr. Hirsch? I'd rather not be by myself.You're a very beautiful girl.I was. What are you reading?Do you like it?I dream of death mostly.It's okay. I want to talk to you.How old are you?How old are you?I'm twenty-seven.Now what do you want to talk about?My best friend. My very best friend.What? Oh, yes, please.Yes, go on.Stop!I'm sorry I woke you up.No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.Will you come with me?I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.Will you think about it?Not just a patient -- me.Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.Now I'm embarrassed.Where were we in the book?Good morning.Please, sir, I want some more.Get the fuck out of here, Jack.This is too much. I can't handle this.Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.I can't stand it.Rudy Levine the shmuck?I'm going completely crazy.What?!Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!I'm not listening!Shut up, you zombie!What's wrong with you? Shut up!Will you be quiet?!What?!What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!Stop it, Jack.Jack, please go away. Please go away.You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!Nurse!Nurse!Nurse! Oh God! Alex!I'm a werewolf.I'll let you know the next full moon.My friend Jack was just here.Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?I was dreaming again?Yeah, I would think so, too.Very nice.Charming.Lovely.There is only one bed.It's nice to see you.Alex?Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?Good.I was awake and he was in my room.I wasn't hallucinating.That's good, Alex. Reassure me.It's all right, I know I'm being insane.Okay, okay. I'm properly reassured!This is very reassuring. I'm feeling very reassured.You're not real.What are you doing here?Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.Get out of here, Jack!A monster. I know, I know.Jack, are you really dead?I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!I will not accept this! Now go away!I will not be threatened by a walking meat loaf!It was just me, Alex. It was just me.Do me an enormous favor?Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.Werewolves simply do not exist.Yeah, I do, but go to work.Okay.A doper werewolf.See you later.What did I do?Thanks a lot, dog.Wonderful.An American werewolf was found frozen to death today in the heart of London, England.What did I do, cat?Snarl. Growl. Grrrr.I'm not hungry.`Moon River, wider than a mile I'm crossing you in style, Someday....'Fee fi fo fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman.Jesus Christ!What? Christ! What?I'm burning up! Jesus!Jack!? Where are you now, you fucker!?!Help me! Somebody help me, please! Jack!!I'm sorry I called you a meat loaf, Jack.Wake me up, Alex.Ouch!Hello.Excuse me, won't you?Pssst!Hey, kid! Pssst. Little boy with the balloons.Come over here.If you come over here, I'll give you a pound.Two pounds?Listen, two pounds is a lot of money. It's almost five dollars.I'm the famous balloon thief.Come here and I'll show you.Come on!A little closer.Thank you.A lot of weather we've been having lately.I'm freezing.Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo! I guess I am out of my fucking mind.I should be committed.I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.My body feels alive, alert. I feel like an athlete.What murders?Pull over.Pull over.Pay the man.Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I....Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police.Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!Officer, I killed those people last night.What?I swear, I don't know this girl.Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!Who is this girl?That's what I want you to do, you moron!Will you shut up!?!!You're not going to arrest me?Don't you think he should arrest me?A prank?Hopeless. It's hopeless.Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!Leave me alone!Yes, operator. I'd like to call the United States and reverse the charges. David Kessler for anyone. Yes, I'll wait. Hello? Yes, area code 315/472-3402. Thank you. Hello? Rachel? Just say yes, you'll accept the charges. Just say yes, Rachel. Is Mom or Dad home? Where are they? Where's Max? You're all alone? Mom and Dad wouldn't leave me alone when I was ten. No, not ten and a half either. I'm still in London. I'm all better. Look, would you tell Mom and Dad that I love them? I don't care, Rachel, just do it for me. Okay? Good. And, Rachel, don't fight with Max. Well, try. Look, kid, please don't forget to tell Mom and Dad I love them. I love Max and you, too. Well, I do. No, I'm not being weird, you little creep. You promise? Okay. Be a good girl. I love you. Bye.Will you take a traveler's check?Keep the change.Hi, Jack.What can I say, Jack?Aren't you going to say, `I told you so'?You look awful.I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.Hello.Why are you doing this to me, Jack?Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.What shall I do?That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.Why are you doing this to me?How shall I do it?I could hang myself.Don't I need a silver bullet or something?Madness.

He called out just now.Chart says he's from New York.Why on earth do you say that?Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.Dr. Hirsch?Yes, Doctor.Yes, Doctor?He said `Jack'.What happened to them?No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.I beg your pardon?What?Yes, I believe he did.Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.Has he been refusing food?Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.Hello, Benjamin.No what?Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.Feeling better?The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.Right.Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?How did he look?You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?Thank you.Mr. Kessler?You haven't eaten your lunch.I'm afraid you have to eat something.You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.Well, you're to take these after you've eaten.

My friend gave it to me.What do you dream about?I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.That's not really a very proper question.Twenty-eight.I know.Was Jack Goodman your good friend?Shall I read to you?A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd....Hello. You all right?Don't be silly. Can I get you something?That's easy enough.David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.What?Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?You're being awfully forward, aren't you?All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.Let me see here.David? David!David, what's wrong?A werewolf?Are you better now?You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?Your dead friend Jack?What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?I would think so.Do you have a place to stay in London?The kitchen.Closet.Bathroom.The bedroom.David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.It's nice to see you.Yes?Of course.David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?But, David.Tomorrow is the full moon.David?David, what's wrong? I heard voices.Let me go now, you'll make me late.Anything.It's silly of you to be apprehensive.David, do you want me to stay here tonight?Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?I've left those pills for you.I'm off. There's food in the fridge.How are we feeling tonight?No what?Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?I thought not.You sleep now and have sweet dreams.It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.Yes, sir.At my flat. I'm off at midnight and....He's not?Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.Yes.David says Jack comes to warn him.Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?Yes.And what else?No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.Surely you're not suggesting....Dr. Hirsch?What shall we do?Hello? No, Dr. Hirsch, he hasn't come back yet. Yes, I will, doctor, but I just feel so helpless sitting here doing nothing. Thank you, yes, goodbye.David! Where on earth have you been!?!The zoo?Don't you remember?I worried about you. We didn't know where you were.Where did you get that coat?I'll get it.Hello?He's here.He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.No, why?No, not really.Yes, I should think so.Yes, Doctor.He's fine. We'll come right over.No, a cab will be faster.The next corner we can get a cab.Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.Get in.Saint Martin's Hospital.I beg your pardon?But....David, wait!David, what are you doing?David, stop!Jack is dead!David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.He's playing a stupid joke, sir.We had an argument. He's being silly.David, please!Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and....Yes, David, let's go.David....David, let's go now.David, don't lose control.David, wait!He tried to have himself arrested. He....He wants help.
