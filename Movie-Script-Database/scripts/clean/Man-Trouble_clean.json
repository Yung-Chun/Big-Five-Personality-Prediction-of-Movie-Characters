{"Man-Trouble": {"JOAN": {"raw_line": "Sorry. I didn't know I was.I wasn't smearing.No, I'm telling you, this is personally motivated. Since I moved out he's been doing this, making remarks and being... incredibly pricklike... *See what I mean?I said fine, let's do it again.No, nothing. That's what's so disturbing. I mean, why would someone do something like this...?What do you mean, somebody doesn't like me? The Fingerprinter interrupts:You think this is someone I know?No.Who could it be?You mean Lewie? He'd never do anything like this.Oh great.Excuse me, it's my sister...Andy, this is not the most opportune time. I happen to have had a burglary in here last night...So could I just call you later?Helen Dextra, you've met her before.Read what? I don't know what you're talking about.Oh no. You've written a book about Red Layls.No, I don't. Let me just call you at home later.Wait, I need to talk to you...I wanted to ask you, if there's somebody, who for some unknown reason, doesn't like me, what do you suggest I do?Really though, I don't see how this could be somebody I know.Because I actually go miles out of my way to avoid conflictual situations.Andy, are you telling me the truth?I mean, are you really going to New York?Well maybe I could stay at your house while you're gone. So could you tell your housekeeper to...Pardon me, but I don't care what he said. My apartment, as you can * see, is a complete shambles, I have * a terrible headache, I've been * informed that somebody doesn't like me, and I really don't want to stay here by myself!Thank you.Socorro!! Wait a minute! I want to talk to you! The Low-Rider comes to a stop. Joan approaches the pas- senger window and leans down to Socorro:Excuse me, Socorro, but do you mind if I ask what's happening, why are you leaving?I'm asking, where-are-you-going?Yes, what's going on, are you bringing her back later or what?Monday? But this is Thursday, I can't stay here alone 'til Monday.Well, this is just glorious. The low-rider moves down the driveway and as it disap- pears onto the street, Joan moves to an electric box atop a metal column at the edge of the driveway. She presses the button and looks at the gates. They remain open. She steps over to the gates and tries to close them manually. The locking device fails to engage and a portion of it falls off into the bushes.Andy's not here! He moves to the glass facade and peers inside, looking * for the source of the voice:She's out of town, and there happens to be several other people in here trying to sleep, so...Will you please go away!?I'm sorry, but if you don't leave, I'm going to call the Foothill Patrol.Tch, where does she find these * people. *Oh god, what if I don't want him to do that?No, I just want him to scare someone.You know, I have an extremely sensitive reaction to dog dander, so maybe I shouldn't...I'm in the process of a divorce and I moved up here because my apartment was burglarized and... But I'm not entirely alone, there's a housekeeper here, and several friends.No, please, don't tell me about that.Ober, platz, geh am platz, bringen, komm, sitz, fuss', fahrt and blieb.Duke, wachen sie.It's not mine, it's my sister's.Am I doing this right? Shouldn't I be prepared for something?Never look at your dog? Okay.I am... Good boy, be nice.I forgot it! You tell him! Duke, stop!My golly, that was incredible. I * love this dog. Did you see that? * I can't believe how strong he is. * I felt like a rag doll... *Yes, that's her, with her third husband, Eric Ellerman.Yes.Well, that's quite a compliment. I'll have to pass it on.Okay.Oh well... ... thank you.And would you also thank your... As she gestures toward June, Harry takes hold of her hand, looking earnestly at her:Don't do that.You're not supposed to look him straight in the eye.He's not just a dog. He's a Schutzhund trained attack dog.I was told to avoid a direct gaze and always look at the base of the right or the left ear.I can't tell you how mad I am at Lewie, that I have to leave him out here, tied to a tree...I'm not stubborn, I'm so accommodating, it's sickening. She pats Duke on the head and stands up:I do.Tonight? A WOMAN chorus member sticks her head out the stage door:I don't know. Let's say maybe.Eddy? Tomorrow's fine. Okay? Before disappearing into the studio, he makes a gesture acknowledging her capitulation.I knew it. I shouldn't have moved here.I don't know what to do. Maybe I should move into a motel.Well he's succeeded. She sits down.Do I do that? *Well I don't normally walk back and forth, but... okay. She attempts a few steps then stops abruptly:I'm sorry, I can't do it with you watching me.Uhm-hmm.But I thought that's your point, no to attract...This is just impossible.You just can't win.Well darn it, I give up... Dropping her head into her hands.I'm sorry but this is really getting to me.That's very sweet of you, Harry. I'd like to do that.How long have you been divorced?And so you like, well, assuming you live a single existence, I * mean most men don't seem to enjoy that, I've read. She lifts her glass, takes a sip, then sets it back down:Really? Well...Yes, anytime. Do you like Classical music?I'm sorry. I shouldn't have laughed.Uhm hmm.You're full of surprises, Harry, you know that? That you've actually read Dante's Divine Comedy I mean...You know that part? 'Yet as a wheel moves smoothly, free from jars, My will and my desire were turned by love, The love that moves the sun and other stars.' He nods, while Joan, hoping to disguise the extent of her emotions, looks down and begins moving her wine in circles:For some reason, the sublimity of that always touches me.You know, it's very sad. I look at my sister and all her marriages and affairs, not to mention the mess my own life is in, and I think it's very sad and very bleak that men and women can't manage to be friends.What a tragedy that sex is often such a barrier to friendship between men and women.You know Dante and Beatrice never slept together.Well, anyway... I shouldn't have had so much wine... because I prefer to go a little slow here.Alright now, don't play too rough. The excitement has unleashed Duke's libido and as she tries to resume her mission, he makes a few attempts to rise against her flanks. Just before she approaches the mailbox, he manages to grip his paws around one of her thighs and unmistakably begins to hump her:No, no, Duke, don't do that, that's not nice. Now sitz. And behave yourself. He sits, panting, with a furtive expression on his face, watching as she steps over to the mailbox and opens it. She takes out a number of letters and sorts through them as she starts back to the house with Duke following. They are in the main addressed to Andy, but in amongst them she finds a bank statement addressed to her, as well as a letter with her name written in pencil on the envelope. She opens it, takes the contents out and stops suddenly:You're not exactly a disinterested party. You're always promoting his cause...My piano tuner.Well everyone appears weird to me * right now. So I put every * possible name down, except for one, who happens to be post- burglary.Just don't tell Lewie about the phone message or the thing I got in the mail, because he'll just use it to...Helen.No, I wouldn't feel comfortable about doing that.Darn it, Lewie.Tch...These are very upsetting, really shitty circumstances I'm dealing with and I...Couldn't you spare yourself then?Please, don't judge me by your scrotal excesses, Lewie.Are you spying on me?Alright, I am seeing someone, okay? He pulls back, narrowing his eyes at her:You know, I hate to mention this but we're having a slight problem with Duke.Well... He keeps getting up and trying to ride on one's extremities.Especially Socorro, who can't speak English, let alone German, and sometimes she has to go pulling him from room to room like a vacuum cleaner.It's not affecting you too much, is it?It's Chopin, a nocturne.Night-piece, it means.That's the problem though, I want to be honest with you...Because I recently realized something about myself. That I've slept with a number of men in my life just because I didn't want them not to like me.But the thing is, I didn't like most of them that much, so why did I care whether they liked me or not?Oh, I know, that's not what I'm saying...What I'm saying is I don't know if right now I might not go to bed with you because I don't want to be alone, so I thought maybe we... could try to explore other modes, or...I mean, there are other ways of being intimate, that people don't even realize.Which doesn't mean I'm not attracted to you.God, it's so hard to pioneer in this area... when you keep doing that...Please leave a message after the tone... Thank you.Maybe I better take this. She tries to move closer to the phone, hindered by Harry's weight.Harry, excuse me, it's my sister. He moves off of her and she leans across his torso, pinning him to the bed as she addresses the speaker:Andy... It's Joan.Where are you? Are you in New York?Andy, wait a minute...Oh God, this is because of Red, isn't it?What am I supposed to do?Hello? Andy? You have to tell me where you are.Andy, tell me the name of the * hospital you checked yourself into.We'll find it, okay, so don't worry...... because I'm sure there's some simple explanation...What should I do? Should I call the police?You mean right now?I told her she shouldn't do this, I mean, to be so maniacally obsessed with this soul of mud that she'd even want to write a book about him, is beyond me...But she does this, you know, she just periodically drops the entire weight of her life on me like a ton of bricks.Yes, please, anything.How do you know he was her physician?And even if he was a doctor, it doesn't mean he was my sister's doctor.Then who was the doctor who operated on her foot?That's a lie. She was in here for an operation, then she was drugged and taken out of here against her will.I can't believe this, you mean there's no phone number or address?How am I supposed to find this man? Maybe he used a false name, or maybe he isn't even a doctor...No, I don't want anything to do with Red, I'm terrified of him.I mean, you hear all kinds of things, about government kickbacks, and Panamanian drug couriers and...No, really, I have to do something. I have to go to the police... He stops walking and takes a hold of her hand:Oh, that's nice.You called me honey.Harry, this isn't your problem and I don't want to draw you into it... *Oh, Socorro...Could you come in here, por favor? As Socorro comes to the landing, Joan indicates one of the open desk drawers:I-am-looking-for-my-sister's-book. Socorro steps closer and glancing into the the now disorderly contents of the drawer, shakes her head defensively:La manuscripto ... de mi hermana, Andy, si? I go... toda la casa... Everywhere... Looking y looking... And no es anywhere. Sabe usted?I told this detective I wanted to press charges against Red Layls, for abducting Andy, for burglarizing my apartment, for breaking into her house...And that he's been trying to scare and intimidate me in case I might have read something in her manuscript that he doesn't want anybody to know. And you know what he said? That I haven't given him probable cause to even go and question Red Layls, or his lawyer...I can't do that, Harry. This is my sister. I can at least make out a missing persons report on her, and then I want to talk to the private detective friend of yours.You mean to Red?Well if I ever find, it, that's the last thing I'd do with it.What is this, have I come at the wrong time or something?Well, someone abates your maidenhood and suddenly feels they can start ordering you around.Oh. Well... I'm sorry if I've overtaxed you with my problems, Harry, but I never asked you to consider them a part of your work. So why don't we speak when you're in a better frame of mind. As she crosss to the door, Harry stands up:Aw honey yourself.Oh, Socorro, please-keep-the-dog ... el perro, in... in piso inferior, por favor... exercise room... Tiene allergy...Come on, let me drive you home.Helen, quick, get in the car! Helen leans down and looks in at her:Helen! Help me!I told you, he was in the house.No you didn't, I said he was dangerous, and you said he wasn't...I don't know if it was him. Maybe it was this tree surgeon... She starts to move toward the bedroom and he stops her:No, he wasn't, he was much taller.But wait, he couldn't be the same man who burglarized my apartment, because that's before I came up here...Gee whiz, first it isn't Red, now it is Red. I can't keep up with these sudden reversals.But I don't think Red would have someone sing into my answering machine...It doesn't seem like something he'd do.God, what is this?! I can't say anything to you anymore, you're so darn touchy!It's Andy's ---- Maybe I don't quite fill it out.Well?What are you going to do now? Are you going to leave?Could you be back for dinner, around 7:00?Good. She waves to him and pulls the rest of the way out of the garage, revealing the ax handle still embedded in the front of the car, its handle sharply angled up from the hood like a soup ladle.Do you like it?You're welcome.Is anything wrong?You're probably wondering why I'm smiling.I was just thinking that I find this moody side of you very attractive.In fact, if you want to know, and I can see you're dying to... I completely adore you.Why are you all wet?What situation?Can you believe this?!Do you see that?Yes it was. * She looks quickly back to the screen -- a commercial comes on. *What did she say? San Dimas? Where's San Dimas?Let's call the T.V. station and find out.First you tell me I go around acting too timid...And now when I suddenly feel like I could save the Pope in an earthquake, you start trying to...That's just a figure of speech. They disappear out the front door.Will you stop trying to undermine me every inch of the way.Anyway, I didn't ask you to drag along with me.Don't tell me what to do.Why should I let you drive?Oh, now all the ugly little truths are coming out.Don't talk to me, Harry. I mean it, just don't say another word to me!I was doing just fine until you started in on me...And now look at me. I've got purpose tremors...No.Okay. What?This isn't going to work. You look like a busboy. They approach a nurses' station and Harry steps forward to address one of TWO NURSES behind the counter:I hope you know what you're doing.Put this on.No, I don't. And hurry up, will you. And as Andy steps into the skirt, Joan takes over the uncompleted buttoning chores:What about her hair?Christ. A soft WHISTLE comes from the vicinity of the windows behind her, followed by Harry's voice, whispering:Yes, it's me. Hurry up, will you!Oh great, Harry. What have you got me into?Don't worry, honey...You have to get me out of here!Andy's not here.As a matter of fact, she happens to be on her way to the police right now, accompanied by a close friend of mine... Her bluff is immediately belied by:Don't say a word, Harry! I'm not alone! Moncrief looks at the chauffeur, gesturing toward the door.Just go get Andy and leave, will you!What agreement?Oh Harry, how could you...Are you alright? ... And in response to Andy's stoical nod:No you're not. What did that bastard do to you?You know what they're trying to do, don't you? To force you into signing some kind of agreement that...What?!Andy, you don't know what you're saying. You're suffering from hostage syndrome or something.You 'love' him?!Oh, now he's not a fecal-faced, great white shark!'Sensitive'? Have you lost all your beads?! This man had you kidnapped and kept in a drugged stupor for the last three weeks, and now he's...Will you listen to me! This man is not only a bastard, he's a scummy, soul-less little thug and a criminal!And furthermore, this 'sensitive' man's lawyer more than implied they were willing to put your feet, as well as probably mine, into a block of cement!Harry, I can't believe you're sitting there nodding your head and having a tea party with these crooks!You're going to talk to me about sleaze, when you consorted with some maniac tree surgeon, who was flicking his tongue out at me like some rutting iguana, and groping at his naturalia at three in the morning?!Oh 'him'?! He came at me with an ax!No, thank you. She moves past him, striding over to Harry and Red:Excuse me!I don't know what kind of spell you've cast on my sister, but it doesn't extend to me...In fact, I've been to the police and I intend to press charges against you...... Not only for having my apartment burglarized but for breaking into Andy's house, as well as hiring someone to frighten, harass and intimidate me!No, Dammit!I'm not here to beg your good opinion...I don't believe you!I don't care whose house you own, you're nothing but a slimy, mean- * minded little hood!Andy, you know something?The kind of woman you are is a danger to the kind of woman I am, so the next time you and your boyfriend have a domestic spat, don't call me!Harry, where are my clothes?Will you go get them RED please, I'd like to leave. Wait a minute, don't rush me on this, Monroe. Harry moves around Red and steps up to Joan:No, I don't.Would you please get me my clothes. Moncrief steps in beside Joan:I would never have knowingly become involved with a married man.Please, I don't want to discuss it anymore. I bet you never read Dante, either.I mean, I can't believe it, that you'd lie to me about this...I'm going in the house.I have a dress rehearsal tomorrow and a concert on Friday. That's all I care about right now. She reaches to the door handle, then very emotionally:And I don't want to see you anymore.No. I didn't extricate myself from the infidelities of one man, just to fall into the arms of the prince of prevaricators...That's not what I observed, Harry.No, go ahead. I'm not hungry.I'll call a cab. Eddy steps INTO FRAME:Thank you, Eddy.I hate living here now. * I'd like to move to a small town, where it's friendly, and everybody knows each other, and there are no bars on the windows...Thanks, Eddy.Are you in a bad mood or something?Could you be more specific?That was witty of me.Well, if you remember, I was in love with Lewis around that time, which I confided to you, so you did know...Excuse me, Eddy, you just passed the turn off to my street. No response.Eddy.Anyway, if I remember correctly, * we only kissed. But if that led you to believe something that hurt you in any way, I apologize. He reaches up to adjust the rearview mirror, inadver- * tently drawing her atttention to his hand. *What happened to your hand?It looks like somebody bit you.Well, am I supposed to guess, or are you going to... She breaks off, suddenly aware that the teeth marks are her own:Oh, Eddy.Why did you do these things?I didn't deserve it. I've always thought of you and treated you as one of my closest and dearest friends...Eddy, I want you to take me home now.Yes I do. You can tell me whatever you want to, but let's go back down to...Eddy...Harry, look out! The warning is simultaneous with an attempt by Eddy to stab him with the knife.Duke, fasse!Oh shit...You bastards!! The search beam of the COPTER spotlights Joan. She is bent over, picking up sticks and stones and as if routing a deadly enemy, she begins hurling them, as well as a series of invectives, at the lights of the city below, her words barely audible over the sound of the ROTORS. The beam sweeps from her, to pick up Harry and Eddy and an AMPLIFIED, God-like voice comes from above:You maniacs!! You liars!! You shits!!I'm finished wagging my tail and leaving little puddles on the floor...!!And smiling on command, because I don't give a damn whether any of you like me or not!!!He's not the Westside Slasher!!None of you are friends of mine, you fucker!!I wasn't kissing him!!Put the knife down, Harry!Give me that thing. She grabs the knife out of his hand, throws it away, then places her arms around him, desperately pantomiming to the helicopter:See? He's not hurting me! He's my friend!! This is just for their benefit.Will you please shut up and go away!! This is private! Can't you see that!?Oh God, I don't want to know, Harry. What is it?Oh. 'Eugene.'

I feel she just overheats on every little side issue, and when I go to try and communicate with the woman, for some unknown reason she doesn't believe a damn thing I say.See what I mean?So what, he's not interested in that, that's not what he's asking. See what she does? She wants to dig up and haul out miscellaneous things that's got nothing to do with this. I mean, I agreed to come here, okay, but I have to tell you, Iwo Jima's got a lot of faulty notions in her head about me that....Pardon me, I was making a statement here.Well, I forgot the upshot of what I was saying, but...The hell you are, honey.... at fifty bucks a shot, out a my pocket... I'm going to listen to some pencil-necked butthead tell me I don't know how to relate to you...I hear you, honey. But let's have just a little more trust on your end of this thing, okay? That's all I ask. Get in.Now don't start lazing around, June. Let's get with it.It's very nice, Sluggo. Go hose out the kennel. She goes back to reading.Where the hell are my nail clippers? The PHONE on his desk begins to RING:I told everybody to stay out of these drawers.Get this first, will you.Remember, don't say I'm here 'til you find out who it is. She picks up the receiver and speaks into it:Yeah? Who was it?Bastard.Don't give me a bad time, lard. I've got enough trouble with Iwo Jima and her complaints, alright? Now the woman doesn't even believe you're my niece.That's not the point I'm making. Suddenly irritated, he begins fumbling through a pile * of bills on top of the desk:You know what's gonna happen if I can't pay these damn breeders and get some adult dogs on the premises? Pretty damn quick, some asses are going to hit the pavement, believe me.Jesus, here I am, sitting in the center of a lot of wealth, the escalation in crime couldn't be better, and I'm not turning a damn nickel on it... He catches sight of something outside: *Oh shit. There's Lee.Now, in regard to any aggressor seeking to give you a bad time, I want to show you what you can expect from a dog of this caliber.Here we have the dog's arsenal, so to speak. The animal is trained to apply pressure to specific points of the body until the bone is more or less crushed. If the attacker is bearing a weapon of any kind, be it a gun, a club, a knife or what-have-you, the dog will, excuse me for saying... ... automatically go for the testicles.You want him to do that.Believe me, this will scare them, as well as incapacitate their mind and any ability to maneuver against you.Let me ask you something. I like to get a general picture of the individual situation I'm working with.Are you married, single, living alone or with some other party?Well, the hills are hit heaven as far as burglaries go. And right up on Mulholland is where they found the fifth victim of the Westside Slasher...Believe me, I know what you're up against, being an attractive, and I take it, unattached woman, such as you are... But we're going to remedy that situation right now, and get you to feeling as safe as a little baby, alright? What've we got there so far?Well, that's enough for a start on the basic control commands... He scans the grounds for signs of something we as yet know nothing of:Now let's do a little work with the assailant.Alright now, Joan, give him the command, 'Duke, wachen sie.'Good. The dog is now on alert.This is really a nice piece of real estate you've got here.Oh, it's your sister's. And where's she?Never look at your dog.Dammit, June, don't exhibit fear until I tell you! Seeing the dog still in pursuit, June ignores the command and as Duke continues to tow Joan behind him:Get him under control now, Joan.Give him the off command!Duke, aus!What did I tell you?Ordinarily I wouldn't do this, even on a temporary rental basis, because he's the absolute top security and attack dog in the country.Is this your sister?Uhm hmm. Wait a minute, who's this guy, isn't this Red Layls?No kidding. Your sister's involved with Red Layls? This guy's gotta be one of the five or ten richest men in the country, with business connections all over the place.And she's your sister. That's amazing. I mean, this is an individual I'd really like to meet sometime. He leans in close to a photograph of Andy in a bikini.Boy, look at that figure. I have to say, your sister is really an attractive looking woman.I'll skip back up in a day or two, okay, just to see how you're doing.And Joan, I want you to know, it's been a great pleasure doing business with you.Feel free to call on me for anything. Anytime of the night or day, 24 hours.I sincerely mean that.Come on, dumpty, don't start that. This is quality clientele. It calls for a certain kind of approach. Just soak some of this in, will you? He steps past her and goes to the van:Start to pattern yourself. Breed up. Observe the woman, for Christ sakes.You don't screw this type of individual.This is the kind of atmosphere we want to gravitate toward. Did she even ask me the cost? Dammit, I really respect that.Well, I'd have to say this place * is a snap to break into.Don't worry. The dog'll take care * of anyone trying to get inside.No, you don't have to do that. This is just some ding-dong that's trying to scare you.But you don't want to give off that impression, by acting too timid or afraid, because that's what invites an aggressive attitude from certain types of men. *For instance, don't go mincing * along, taking mousey little steps, and waving your hanky, because * you're drawing a target on yourself if you do...Well, let's see. Just walk back and forth the way you normally do.Okay, but keep in mind that you want to exhibit a very confident attitude. Look like you know what you're doing and where you're going.Just remember to stop short of appearing a little dykey, because that's not attractive.No, no, you always want to remain a little bit attractive. Otherwise that can set somone off too.Sure you can, it's just a matter of degree.Uh-oh. Now what's this?Tell you what. Let me take you out of here, buy you a drink, and * see if we can't get your mind off these kind of things.Oh, I'd say seven or eight years, around there.I have to tell you the truth... I've been observing your hands, and I have to use the word exquisite.You're probably quite a singer too. I'd like to come down and catch you sometime.Very much. Even to the degree that when it's playing on the radio, I sometimes have to turn the damn thing off. Thinking he is revealing a peculiar brand of wit, she laughs.I just mean it starts to get to me too much. I can't swallow my saliva.Yeah, symphonies, operettas, poems, things like that. All those type of things really get to me.Well, it was a while back there that I did, yeah...It depends on the man and woman you're talking about. They arrive at the fence and as she speaks she rests one of her hands on the railings:There I disagree with you.Is that right? Oh yeah, I forgot that part.We can go as slow as you want... why not?Oh yeah, absolutely.What?Oh don't worry about that.No, that's just normal in most of your adult males. Some percentage of the time they're gonna attempt to make these vulgar motions on your person. He places his arm on the couch behind her:You just have to be very firm and stay on top of him. In the sky beyond the hills a helicopter beams its light.No, it's very nice.You know what's affecting me?You are.Don't worry about it.There's no problem. He leans over and kisses her. After a moment she breaks off:Uhm hmm.You know, I'm not one of these guys who's going to look upon you as an object.Because I look upon a woman as a whole.Other modes?Uhm hmm.Other modes is fine. You don't have to be shy with me. I've been asked to do do every kind of thing in the book. He kisses her once more. Her response, is far less tentative. As it begins to border on the ardent, she breaks off again:Find out where she is.Tell her we'll find it.No.Well the guy must be doing something right to have amassed that amount of wealth.Joan, can I make a suggestion?You better try an keep up a little with the flow or we're gonna get cited.Hell, I could come in here and say I was a doctor an' sign somebody out.Okay, let's stop wasting time here, where is this guy, what's his name?What kind of business are you running here, buddy?Nothing. No Dr. Monroe Park.I've got a couple of ideas here. First, we want to try an' connect with Red Layls.There's nothing to be afraid of, believe me.I know these type of guys. You take away their money and their power, and what are they.Just hold off a bit on that, honey, will you?What?Well that's what you are.I want to get a hold of this top private investigator, who's a close, personal friend of mine, okay, and get him to find out who this doctor is.Don't worry, we're going to find your sister. Everything's going to turn out fine.No, it's not what you think. This is a very unique individual I'm talking about. Plus there's a mind there, as well as a body and a face.I'm telling you, this is something completely different. You gotta meet her. She sings opera and has * the hands of a hula dancer...Anyway, you remember that private * detective that use to come in here all the time? On the portly side, bald, had kind of crossed eyes...Yeah, that's him. How do you think I could get a hold of him?What?! * June, mouthing \"There's some guy over there wants to see you.\" Then she gestures to a Continental Town Car in the parking lot next to The House of Bliss.You're talking to the wrong godammed party, you know that?No, you hear me out, friend... He takes note of the driver coming around the front of the car. He stops a few feet off and unbuttons his jacket, revealing the cross-strap of a shoulder holster.Look, I happen to have a very high regard for this party. And maybe I even have some feelings of a personal nature here.Goddamned right.Wait a minute.You know, that's not necessarily entirely accurate, I mean, I don't know where you come up with these so-called facts, but... I can't go sneaking around, stealing this lady's property.What do you mean, 'unpleasant'?Jesus Christ, I hardly know the woman. I'm just renting a dog to her, that's all. What kind of a person do you take me for? Harry stands in the parking lot, watching as the Con- tinental drives off. He starts to move toward The House of Bliss, then stops and opens the voucher, braving a look at it.Oh come on, you're way off.Well, he's right, I could've told you that. This is a man who goes fishing with the President, honey. He's a little high up to go around burglarizing people and sending them nasty notes. So why don't you just ease back on this thing for awhile... Life's too godammed short.I'm trying to chase the guy down, okay? But don't go and make yourself sick... He begins pushing the paraphernalia around on his desk:I mean, Jesus, why don't you just get this damn thing and hand it over to me and I'll give it to these guys.Yeah, to Red, or whoever...Dammit, you're making my work more difficult for me, you know that!I tell you what the hell to do and you don't listen to me! Joan looks down at the floor, attempting a drollery:I'm not ordering you around. I'm just giving you my opinion. And maybe I get tired of hearing about this stuff all the time, this book business, this manu-whatever, and Red Layls, and your sister.Ah honey, now...What's her problem.Now what's she complaining about?I mean, what's wrong with these women.They don't want to hear the truth, that's what disturbs me.You tell them the truth and they come at you with a cleaver.What guy?You're going to leave me, lard, just after I've broken you in, and taught you the fine art of dog training?Women. What's the score?Why didn't you have the damn dog with you, that's what he's for!What the hell good is that! You have to have him with you at all times!Yeah, but that's before he tried to part your hair with an axe!Wait a minute. How tall was he? About six one? Kind of ugly? Helen, now with a drink in her hand, steps INTO VIEW behind Harry:Forget about him. I know what I'm talking about... HELEN * Joan, if you don't call the * police, I'm not staying here. *Guy like Red Layls have hit men working for them, that drive them around and do their dirty work for them.It's not more than one person. I'm telling you who the hell it is!Dammit, Joan!! She steps out of the closet and comes toward the bedroom, * dressed in one of Andy's negligees.You can mention anything you want, * honey. I'm just trying to keep you from turning up face down, that's all. After a moment: HARRY * I mean, I can't leave you up here alone now...It's very becoming on you.Yes you do.Yeah, I'm going to skip down the hill, take care of a few things, pick up some clothes...Yeah. Sure.Hi.I just want to look for my... ... watch, I think I left it... ... in there.Thanks, Soco.I just got a phone call, honey, from a prominent entertainer up in Vegas, a very well-known singer...He's a rock star, you probably wouldn't know the name. Anyway, I gotta run a couple a dogs up to him...Now Iwo, don't blow this way out of proportion. You think I want to do this. I need the extra cash right now, believe me.Come on now, honey, don't say things like that... He puts an arm around her, giving her a perfunctory hug:Let's not make a big issue out of it... Okay?It's really very nice looking, honey.Yeah. I do. Very much. She finishes securing the watch.Thank you.Yeah it's great and it's something I really needed, so... He leans over and kisses her on the cheek, then picks up his fork and begins poking with disinterest at his food.No. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine. She resumes eating. Then, desirous of drawing his atten- tion, she fixes her gaze on the table top and smiles pensively, making the assumption that he is looking at her. When no response is forthcoming, she attempts a verbal solicitation:What?Oh, uh-huh.Well, same here, honey.You know, there is something I feel I gotta say here, Joan, that's been preying on my mind. Something I maybe should've handled a bit differently with you from the start, about this particular situation I'm in...Well, you recall I mentioned to you a while back, that I was finished... Socorro steps INTO VIEW, addressing Joan with great excitement:This is not the way you want to go about this, honey. As she moves OUT OF VIEW into the living room, he turns * to Socorro: *Tell her, Soco. She shouldn't mess with these people.Will you just once take the benefit of my advice?Yeah, but this is a whole different situation here...This is not the Pope we're talking about here, believe me.Dammit, Joan, these people are holding all the cards. They'll probably throw you into that bughouse with your sister.You want to go there and call 'em a bunch of names, throw a lot of accusations at them? They don't care. People with that kind of money behind them, with their kind of connections, they never go to jail, you never see them behind bars.Am I getting through to you?Alright.Jesus Christ.This is just nuts, what you're doing.Look at this goddamned traffic. *You're the one that's dragging along. Go around the goddamned truck. *Okay, just let me drive the goddamned car, that's all I ask.Why? I'll tell you why, because you're a terrible driver, that's why.You operate this vehicle like it was a cane with a red tip painted on the end of it.Driving around with a goddamned ax stuck in your car...Is something the fuck bothering you, pal?Can I at least offer some advice?Good. Just barge into the place, honey, and play the big hero. When he tells you your sister's not there, what're you going to do, cry? She stops walking and as he moves up beside her, looks defiantly at him:Excuse me, Nurse...Don't worry. Just do what I told you. They approach room 206.What's the problem, dear?I understand. You're doing your job.She had to step inside for a moment, to relieve herself.That's very correct.I'd say female troubles, mainly.Sometimes he does, yes. By the way, did anyone ever tell you what attractive eyebrows you have?Certainly. He moves to the door, opens it, blocking the Nurse's view into it with his body.Don't worry Mrs. Ellerman, we'll be right back. Andy, wearing dark glasses and with her hair hidden up under the stingy-brim hat, steps out into the hallway.Which way?Don't mention it. The Nurse watches briefly as they move away, then extracting a key from her pocket, she steps over to the door and locks it.Here, put this on.Harry.Stay in the car. Don't talk to anybody, and I'll be right back.Fuck! He turns and moves OUT OF SIGHT.Joan? Are you there?Is that you?I'm having a little trouble getting back in.Everything's under control, just hang on a few more minutes and I'll be right back, okay? As he moves out of sight, her attention is drawn to the sound of MUFFLED VOICES in the hallway. In a panic, she starts toward the bathroom, changes her mind, moves to the bed and gets into it. As the door begins to open, she grabs one of the pillows and quickly covers her head with it.Aw, Jesus.Honey? It's me again. Moncrief and Joan look toward the window:I have to tell you something. Joan jumps from the bed and moves to address Harry:Who's there?Shit.That's what I'm trying to tell you...Bullshit! I never agreed to anything! This asshole approached me and tried to bribe me into working for them, and I told him to go to hell!Oh, you want to see your check?Honey, don't go by anything this guy says, because I'm the only one who knows what the hell I'm doing. It just slipped my mind, I was going to tell you. See? I never cashed the fucking thing!Alright, what the hell's going on in here?Mr. Layls...I just want a say, that though you're someone in a category I admire, you've gone to some lengths on this thing here, that I don't entirely agree with...Okay. No problem. As he seats himself in the other chair, Red reaches up and takes a glass of tea offered by Moncrief:But I want to go on and finish my thought on this, because...Oh, uh huh.Uhm-hmm. ON JOANI'm not nodding my head, honey, I'm just listening to the man.Honey, he's not supposed to get excited.You know, maybe you better not...Now wait a minute...Uh...So what. I'm talking to this lady...Never mind that shit. Tell her... He shakes him, causing him to spill his iced tea onto the front of his jacket:Did I spend your money! Did I give you any services for it. Tell this woman the truth, you son of a bitch! Harry releases him and under the following, Moncrief takes out a handkerchief and dabs at his jacket:Wait a minute, honey... As she disappears inside, Red re-enters, and covering the speaker vents on the beeper, strides over to Moncrief:Honey, there's a simple explanation to all of this, if you want me to go into it... I was trying to tell you at dinner... She disappears into an intersecting hallway.Will you just stop for one minute and let me talk to you... It's very complicated...Look, you know, you live a life, honey, you make some mistakes. You get married for maybe mutual benefits, or business considerations weighing on you at the time, and because you don't think the right person is ever going to come along.I know that, that's why I was trying to come out and tell you...Now there you're 75 percent wrong.Okay, I lied. Didn't you ever tell a lie? If not let me kiss your high heel.Wait. Can I call you tomorrow, just to see how you're feeling? Or how things are going?Don't say that, please. I'm asking you to just give me the chance to clear up all these things in my life, because...Well, I may be all kinds of a son of a bitch, and the prince of whatever, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't, when it comes down to it, stand up and take the bullet for you. She finally looks over at him, her eyes brimming with tears:Lee, I'm in the neighborhood of getting my hands on the money. I'm about to close a business deal with Vark Zulethian of Zulethian Carpets, you've probably heard of him...Look, our agreement was I could buy the dog back. He's the only thing I got to prove to people what I can do, and all I'm asking you, Lee, is...Duke, geh im wagen. Duke jumps into the back of the van. Inside is a large wire travel kennel with another German shepherd inside. Lee removes the leash from Duke and gestures at the other dog:No, I don't want the dog.Do me one favor, will you? Say 'owner' if you want to, but don't say 'trainer.' I trained that dog.Yeah.Okay, what is this! What the hell are you doing with this guy! He reaches in and pulls Eddy away from Joan.Jesus Christ... He grabs Eddy's arm and in hauling him out of the car, rips loose the sleeve of Eddy's shirt.Are you crazy?! What are you doing, running around with a guy like this!!What are you yelling at me for?! This son of a bitch is probably the Westside Slasher!Wait a minute, honey...Yeah, she's alright!! I've got him!! The Westside Slasher, I got him!!A friend of yours! This guy's a friend of yours?!Look, you assholes! The guy was holding a knife at her throat!!What were you doing, kissing this guy!?Why don't you go harass someone else!!I just saved her life, you son of bitches!!But that's what I am, honey, your friend, that's what I wanted to tell you, and then I saw you with this guy...I just wanted to tell you, because you don't know, how important you are to me...And I needed you to know this one other thing about me, because I don't want to withhold anything from you anymore...My real name's not Harry.

"Hello? Anybody home?Hi, Joanie...I just got in from Hawaii and thought I'd drop by for a minute. What the heck happened in here?Oh really? That's awful.Well, can't you give me one minute? I'd like to know if you got the manuscript I sent you. Who's that?Oh, I have? Anyway, did you read it?I'm talking about the book I've written about Red and me, that I sent you a copy of, is that so hard to follow?Not just about him, Joanie, he's only one of many episodes in my life, you know that. Have you got a Perrier?I'm not going to be home. I'm checking into a hospital to have a bone spur removed from my foot. Then I'm going to New York, to meet with a top publisher... ... which, incidentally, I would not care for Mr. Redmon, fecal- face Layls to know. Melvenos and the Fingerprinter re-enter: *And to top it off, my lawyer said, 'Don't worry, they're just pissing into the wind...'Some help I'm going to get from him, because he's scared to death of Red.Yes, he's afraid, they're all afraid, they're all off skiing.Yes, I'm going to New York, where I intend to remain in semi-private seclusion, at an undisclosed...Wait, I just want you to hear what this colosal shit said about me, through his great white shark of a lawyer.Fine, why don't you take my house then?Gee whiz, why make such a big deal out of everything?I just got off a plane that almost fell into the Pacific Ocean like a piece of rotten fruit... ... but did I mention it?Joan? It's Andy... Are you there? I want to inform you that these people are drugging me...There's no phone in my room, or cable TV. I've had to sneak into this cell next to me, with some poor lithium zombie lying here like a comatose cabbage...And this is the lengths this assassin is willing to go to suppress me, because he does not want me to have my book.Oh you're there. Thank God.No, that's what I'm telling you. I went into the hospital first, for one day, just to have a simple bone spur...... and the next thing I know I'm transported some place the hell else, against my knowledge, while I was completely medicated...Do you understand the implications of this, I have no underpants on, and absolutely no recourse to my rights! Joan sits up, and in her alarm is unaware that one of her hands grabs hold of a swatch of hair on Harry's chest, causing him to wince:Yes, it's because of Red, isn't that obvious!? Evidencing interest in their exchange, Harry manages to reach to his cigarettes on the night stand.And if he and that fuckface lawyer in his paid employ, think they can ... Wait. I think I hear someone.I told you, I don't know where I am, these bastards are very clever. She looks at the heavily-meshed wires covering the window:I'm in some private cracker box in the boonies, with godammed wires on the windows...Mount Haven, it's in the South Bay, and don't ask me these inane * questions, just do something... *I hear someone coming, I have to get off.And if this little kinglet of corporate shit thinks he can get away with this, he's greatly mistaken. Just wait 'til he hears what I'm going to come out with now.Remember when he passed me off as staff and I was put on official government payroll all through Maui and the Yucatan Mission?Yes you do, remember, when I almost died of the vomito negro? Well that's when he was doing all that illegal oil drilling off the Mexican Gulf... She turns to look critically at her face in the mirror:Have you got any lipstick?Who's he?And this man, who wouldn't know the truth if it came up and spit him in the eye, is accusing me of lying... She hands him the skirt out through the window:You know what that prick had his lawyer say to me?That I was a pretty, grudge- bearing little malcontent, grasping at some splinter of celebrity for myself at his expense. Can you believe that? She hands him out the blouse and he turns politely away from her semi-nudity as he hands her the doctor's jacket.I mean, the arrogance... What did she say your name was?Have you got a cigarette, Harry?You son of a bitch!Who the hell do you think it is?!No thanks to you, it's me. ... and throws them onto the dashboard.I need a Kleenex. She moves toward the nightstand with Joan following:Wait, I want to tell you what he said to me... She extracts a tissue from a dispenser on the nightstand:He said I was the only woman he's ever really cared for...And when he said it... ... he had a tear in his eye...Well, after all I do love him.Yes, he's been a very important man in my life, you know that.I don't know where she got that.

Not as bad as yours.Remember when we were on tour in Japan, in '86?The night after we did a concert in Osaka?We had a few drinks in your room. * And a certain intimacy took place. She appears uncertain that she shares the same memory. *And when I asked to see you the next * night, you know what you said? You * were too tired and sleepy.But you weren't.

In fact, it's been very disturbing to me, Joan. Very disillusioning. To see that before you've even gotten rid of Lewie, you've started up with some other man.You know, there's so many things about me you have no idea of. You never ask me about my life or what I'm thinking, because you have no interest...Creative things, and dreams, and feelings I have, that Lewie or anyone else in your life, are not capable of...

Harry stands up, leaving the vulnerable area of his stomach framed in the passenger window.

He removes several typed pages, stapled together and looks down at the pillow covering Joan's face:... Red is, very generously, I think, prepared to offer his sanction to a sanitized version of your book. No response. Moncrief glances over at Sturge, standing near the door, then back at the figure on the bed.I think you should know, that if you push this too far, you run the risk of having him withdraw his consent to your well-being. I don't think we want that, do we, Andy? He reaches down and removes the pillow. Joan looks fear- fully up at him:I can see that, Miss Spruance. Would you care to tell me where she is?Sturge.
