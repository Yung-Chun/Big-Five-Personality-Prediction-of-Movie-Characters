Jose, what's going on?I didn't volunteer.No trouble.No, sir.I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.I mashed the spider, didn't I?Uh...I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.Uh, I didn't hear the...Well, the guard woke me up. He told me I volunteered.Uh, thank you.No, sir!I need to go now.\"James\"! Nobody ever calls me that.No, not possible. Listen, I have to get out of here. I'm supposed to be getting information.It won't help you. You can't do anything about it. You can't change anything.I need to go.Because I'm a good observer. Because I have a tough mind.They wanted identification. I don't have any identification. I wasn't trying to hurt them.No.You wouldn't understand.I have to go.Underground.I love this air. This is wonderful air.It's so clean. No germs.I have to go.This is April, right?July?!What year is it?1995?No, 1995 is the past.Where are you taking me?South of France?! I don't want to go to the South of France. I want to make a telephone call.I need to make a telephone call.It's very important.I need to make a telephone call.This is a place for crazy people! I'm not crazy!Well, you've got some real nuts in here! Listen to me, all of you -- I have to tell you something that's going to be difficult for you to understand, but...1989. Look, I'm not confused. There's been a mistake, I've been sent to the wrong place.Hey, I'm not going to hurt anybody.Do any of you know anything about the Army of the Twelve Monkeys? They paint this, stencil it, on buildings, all over the place.Right. I guess you wouldn't, this is 1989, they're probably not active yet. That makes sense! Okay. Listen to me, three billion people died in 1995. Three billion, got that? Almost the whole population. Of the world! Only about one percent survived.Save you? How can I save you? It already happened! I can't save you. I'm simply trying to get some information for people in the present so that someday... You don't believe me. You think I'm crazy. But I'm not crazy. I'm a convict, sure, I have a quick temper, but I'm as sane as anyone in this room. I...No! Look, I don't belong here! What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.Scientists. I'm supposed to report in to them. They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.No, no. I can't talk to them. It's called, \"voice mail\". I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.No, no. This is the past. This has already happened. Listen...No, 1995 is the past, too. Look...No! I mean yes, but... Look, I've been given a lot of drugs but I'm still perfectly lucid. You have to let me use the phone. One call!It was some lady. She didn't know anything.No. That's the reason they chose me -- I remember things.What?Wait! This is only 1989! I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995. It's not the right number yet. That's the problem. Damn! How can I contact them?Germs?!I'm not crazy.If you know how to escape, why don't you...?What's that mean?They hurt you!Look at those assholes, they're asking for it! Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!What are you talking about???It's private.What....???What...???No more drugs. Please...Uh, what?Uh, that message...me?I couldn't call! You sent me to the wrong year! It was 1989.They forced me to take drugs.I got into trouble. I got arrested. But I still got you a specimen -- a spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it. It was the wrong year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.Uh, no, sir. I...Uh, I think so. In the mental hospital.Where are you?My name's not \"Bob\".Where are you?What do you mean, \"maybe\"? What's that supposed to mean?It was supposed to be 1995.What? What??I don't understand. Where am I?I...don't understand.JOSE!1989. Six years for you. There's the sign! Right here!You told me you'd help me. I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad. Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture. I can read, remember?It's the next step. I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone. Zs that a radio? Does it play music?I've never seen the ocean!You used to call me \"James\".Everybody's got a gun. In this city...Can you...can you make it louder? I love hearing twentieth century music! Hearing music and breathing air!\"Never cry wolf!\"My father told me that. \"Never cry wolf.\" Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.Something bad. Is that all the music? I don't want to hear this stuff...Ohhhh, that one! Can we hear that one?You were in my dream just now. Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.About an airport...before everything happened. It's the same dream I always have -- the only one. I'm a little kid in it.You were very upset. You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.No, I think it was always you. It's very strange.I'll be back in a minute.My notes. Observations. Clues.A secret army. The Army of The Twelve Monkeys. I've told you about them. They spread the virus. That's why we have to get to Philadelphia. I have to find them -- it's my assignment.I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates. So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure. So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth.You won't think I'm crazy next month. People are going to start dying. At first the papers will say it's some weird fever, some virus. Then they'll begin to catch on. They'll get it.I thought it was about us. I thought maybe they'd found us and arrested me or something.Just a joke.When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.Nevermind. It's not real -- it's a hoax. A prank. He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here. Left!Where I come from we think of this as Eden. If we could just see the sun, eat sun-grown food. Eden! Look at them! They donut know what they have. They don't see the sky. They don't feel the air!The Twelve Monkeys!!! They're here. Somewhere. Come on!Look, I'm warning you. You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!They're keeping an eye on me.The man...with the voice. I recognized him. He's from the present. He...Please! Please don't hurt me!Are you hurt?Come an. We're running out of time. You can't help him.I did him a favor. Now come on.I've got one now.I, uh, I'm looking for the, ah, the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.I just need some information...I told you what I want. Lock the door!Lock it now!Mason???No, I don't watch TV.Is this him -- Dr. Mason?Tell me more about Jeffrey.The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.What's that mean?What's this?All I see are dead people. Everywhere. What's three more?The guy was a total fruitcake.No -- he said his father was \"God\"!We need gas.I said I was too young to drive. I didn't say I was stupid.I got shot. Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.It was some kind of...war. Never mind, you wouldn't believe me. Turn off here.You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?That has your name on it. Give him cash.Where are you going?I love seeing the sun.You smell so good.I have to do something now. Something I don't want to do. I'm so sorry.I have a mission. It's important.You do know me. You helped me once.I'm here about some monkeys.Monkeys. Twelve of them.Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything. I can't stop you. I just want some information...I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all! For the future!I don't have time to go upstairs. The police are looking for me. I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.Plan? What are you talking about?Bulishit! You're fucking with my head!Listen, you dumb fuck! The thing mutates We live underground! The world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats. We're like moles or worms. All we want to do is study the original...LIGHTS! LIGHTS!I...I...I'm really sorry.No! I...don't think so. I stole a car and they chased me. I hit a tree.Yeah, sort of, I guess. I...I'm sorry I locked you up. I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus. And suddenly, I wasn't sure. We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff. You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race? It was my idea?I'm...\"mentally divergent\". I would love to believe that.I need help all right. They're coming after me.It would be great if I'm crazy. If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay. I'll never have to live underground.The gun! ... I lost itNo gun! Stars! Air! I can live here. Breathe!I love this world!You...don't...exist! You're in my mind...I DON'T WANT YOUR \"WOMEN,\" YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!YOU DON'T EXIST, YOU SILLY BOZOS! YOU'RE NOT REAL! HA HA HA! PEOPLE DON'T TRAVEL IN TIME! YOU AREN'T HERE. MADE YOU UP! YOU CAN'T TRICK ME! YOU'RE IN MY MIND! I'M INSANE AND YOU'RE MY INSANITY!I saw you! In 1995! In the real world! You were a bum! You pulled out your teeth.FUCK YOU!Oh, yeah? What do I want?Tell me. Tell me what I want.More...than...anything.No, sir! I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet. And I have the experience, I know who the people are...Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it...\"dimensions.\" It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused. You don't know what's real and what's not.Yes, sir.I understand. There'd be no point.It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth.Kathryn!No, I want to turn myself in. Where is he? Don't worry -- it's all okay now. I'm not crazy any more! I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me. I want to get well...I've seen that...before.I don't understand what we're doing.You mean, treat me? Cure me? Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before... I...I...dreamed them.I thought I was in...prison again.No, not really. It's...it's in my mind. Like you said.I don't know -- I don't remember.It was? I didn't...know.I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid. Where a boy...Well, maybe that kid saw the same TV show and copied it. Listen, you were right, it's all in my head. I'm mentally ill, I imagine all that stuff. I know they're not real, I can trick them, make them do what I want. I just worked on them in my head and I got back here. I can get better. I can stay here....I had a dream about...something like that.You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...I want to be here. In this time. With you. I want to become...become a whole person. I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.Is this real -- or is this one of my delusions?You want me to rob him?Just...just in case. In case I'm not crazy... That's how they find us. By our teeth. I don't want them to find me. Ever. I don't want to go back.A Carpet Cleaning Company?You... you left them a message?\"The Army of the Twelve Monkeys -- they're the ones who are going to do it. I can't do anything more. The police are watching me.\"They got your message, Kathryn. They played it for me. It was a bad recording...distorted. I didn't recognize your voice.I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid. It was on TV.I have seen it, but I don't remember this part. Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past. The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.Flowers! What flowers?Why are we doing this?But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you're wrong. Maybe we're both crazy.Where can we hide for a few weeks?Kathryn?!You were in my dream just now. I didn't recognize you.I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you. Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, \"We did it.\"I know this place! ... This is my dream.It's not just my dream. I was actually here! I remember now. My parents brought me to meet my uncle. About a week or two before...before...before everybody started dying.I was here...as a kid. I think you were here, too. But you...looked just like you look now.Right! You're right. I have to fix this.Listen, I don't know whether you're there or not. Maybe you just clean carpets. If you do, you're lucky -- you're gonna live a long, happy life. But if you other guys exist and you're picking this up -- forget about the Army of The Twelve Monkeys -- they didn't do it. It was a mistake' Someone else did it. The Army of The Twelve Monkeys are just dumb kids playing revolutionaries. It was someone else!I've done my job. I did what you wanted. Good luck. I'm not coming back!Leave me alone! I made a report. I didn't have to do that.This is the present. This is not the past. This is not the future. This is right now!I'm staying here! You got that? You can't stop me!Jo...Jose????What? What for? Are you crazy?How did you find me?The call I just made? Five minutes ago?This part isn't about the virus, is it?It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.Who am I supposed to shoot?I love you, Kathryn. Remember that.Get your hands off her!I said, get your hands off her. She's not a criminal. She's a doctor...a psychiatrist.", "clean_line": "ssssst jose going volunteer trouble sir went surface collected specimens like told mashed spider uh think sure nd street uh hear guard woke told

Something so bad...?We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours. What was the dream about?And I was in it? What did I do?It wasn't me before, James. It's become me now because of...what's happening. Please untie me.You're flushed. And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.

Please -- he's dangerous -- just cooperate.James, why don't we...?Jeffrey Mason?If those young men don't get loose, they could die in that basement.You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James? You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.This can't go on, James. You're not well. You're burning with fever.I thought you didn't know how to drive.What's the matter with your leg?Shot! Who shot you?No. I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.You can come with me. I have to get some things. Scissors, bandages, some alcohol or whiskey. ... I have to look at your leg, James. I'm a doctor.You shouldn't put your weight on it. You need stitches and antibiotics. Lucky for you it was near the surface.Wait -- let me help you.You have to give yourself up, you know.You bastard! You total bastard!I could have died in there. If something had happened to you I would have died.What have you done? Did you...kill someone?See -- you can drive after all!What made you think that?Nobody is going to wipe out the human race. Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else. You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.It can be dealt with, but only if you want to. I can help you.First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running. Okay?Give me the gun.You're sure?I'm going to attract their attention, let them know where we are, okay?They'll tell you to put your hands on top of your head. Do what they tell you. You're going to get better, James -- I know it!Remember, I'm going to help you. I'll stay with you. I won't let them...Then I said something to him about cooperating and he said he would do that, so I got in the car and started honking the horn. When I got out, he was gone.He wouldn't do something like that -- he...I'd like to be clear about this. That man and the other one were...\"severely\" beating us. James Cole didn't start it. In fact -- he saved me!It's a normal reaction to a life- threatening situation. He's sick. He thinks he comes from the future. He's been living in a carefully constructed fantasy world and that world is starting to disintegrate. He needs help!No -- I'm in a state of hyper- alertness. I can't sleep.I hate those things. They mess my head up.He's dead, isn't he -- that little boy?He not only used the word \"prank\" -- he said the boy was hiding in a barn.For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!And what we believe is what's accepted as \"truth\" now, isn't it, Owen? Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion. And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen. I'm losing my faith.You found him? Is he all right?No!Please, I know it sounds insane but...IS ANYBODY IN THERE? HELLO? IS SOMEONE IN THERE? IF YOU'RE IN THERE, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.I SAW YOU! I SAW SOMEONE MOVING. I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!You! I know you!Have you seen James Cole? The man...?The police. I know. Listen, I need to talk to James, but he has to be careful how he contacts me. He mustn't get caught. Do you understand me?He was with me, he spoke to you. Several weeks ago. He said you were from the future...watching him.James!James! That's a policeman. Pretend you don't know me. If he sees you...James -- put your hands down and listen to me. Things have changed!James, come on! We have to get out of here!James, trust me. We're in terrible trouble. We have to run.James! Come on.We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.An hour?!Here's ninety eight. For the night. Deal?Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?Just like that? You were in prison?You disappeared! One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?The boy in the well. How did you know that was just a hoax?James, you said he was hiding in the barn...IT WASN'T A TV SHOW! IT WAS REAL!What does this mean to you?You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James! How did it get there?Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying to. I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon.James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number! You tried to call and...This is definitely real: Excuse me, I think we have a little misunderstanding here...JAMES -- DON'T!Put him in the closet, ... But get his money first.I...I...We need cash, James.James, no!Oh, my God, James. Did you kill him?Push it tight!Wait here. I'm going to try that phone number. Let's hope it's nothing!James! James! It's okay. We're insane! We're crazy!It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...No superiors! No scientists. No people from the future. It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company. They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.I couldn't resist. I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...You... you couldn't have heard me.Come on.And this. Anything else?I guess that's it.No -- I'll pay cash.What floor are the wigs on, please?Here, let me help you.Shh -- don't talk. Hold still.If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.It's an expression. Here...So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music. So we can appreciate what we have while we have it. Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't. If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.You said you'd never seen the ocean...Well, you look pretty different, too.I remember you...like this. I feel I've known you before. I feel I've always known you.Nine thirtyTight? My watch says 7:30.What? What did you say?That's what they were up to! Freeing animals!Maybe it's going to be okay.Airports all look the same. Maybe it's... James! Your moustache! It's slipping.They may be looking for us, James. Use this. You can fix it in the Men's Room.James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop.Judy Simmons. I have reservations for Key West.It's...a long story.Oh, my God!James! Thank God! I thought you'd disappeared. Listen, I think I know who it is! I saw him! It's Dr. Mason's assistant. An apocalypse nut! The next flight to San Francisco leaves from Gate 38. If he's there, it has to be him.Maybe we can stop him. Maybe we can actually do something.Oh, God, we don't have time for this.Please listen to me -- this is very urgent!THERE HE IS! HE'S CARRYING A DEADLY VIRUS!

Huh? I'd be doing your job.Okay, Billings. Five thousand. That's enough. Five thousand dollars. I'll give him the Deluxe Mental Hospital Tour.Kid around, kid around. It makes them feel good, we're all pals. We're prisoners, they're the guards, but it's all in good fun, you see?Here's the games. Games vegitize you. If you play the games, you're voluntarily taking a tranquilizer.What'd they give you? Thorazine? How much? Learn your drugs -- know your doses.A telephone call? That's communication with the outside world! Doctor's discretion. Hey, if alla these nuts could just make phone calls, it could spread. Insanity oozing through telephone cables, oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people, infecting them! Whackos everywhere! A plague of madness. In fact, very few of us here are actually mentally ill. I'm not saying you're not mentally ill, for all I know you're crazy as a loon. But that's not why you're here. Why you're here is because of the system, because of the economy. There's the TV. It's all right there. Commercials. We are not productive anymore, they don't need us to make things anymore, it's all automated. What are we for then? We're consumers. Okay, buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen. But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you know what? You're mentally ill! That's a fact! If you don't buy things...toilet paper, new cars, computerized blenders, electrically operated sexual devices...So if you want to watch a particular program, say \"All My Children\" or something, you go to the Charge Nurse and tell her what day and time the show you want to see is on. But you have to tell her before the show is scheduled to be on. There was this one guy who was always requesting shows that had already played. He couldn't quite grasp the idea that the Charge Nurse couldn't just make it be yesterday for him, turn back time ha ha. What a fruitcake!!Seriously, more and more people are being defined now as mentally ill. Why? Because they're not consuming on their own. But as patients, they becone consumers of mental health care. And this gives the so-called sane people work! WHOOO! SHOCK THERAPY! GROUP THERAPY!Right! Right! Carried away, heh heh. I got \"carried away\". Explaining the workings of...the institution.This is TJ Washington, Jim -- he doesn't really come from outer space.Staff! Whoo! Time for Staff. Now the geniuses cure you. Hallelujah!You think you can remove the grill but you can't. It's welded.See? I toldja. And all the doors are locked, too. They're protecting the people on the outside from us. But the people outside are as crazy as us.You know what \"crazy\" is? \"crazy\" is \"majority rules\". Take germs for example.In the 18th century there was no such thing! Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway. Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think. He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible \"bad things\" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick! He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands. What is this guy...crazy? Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?...\"germs\"!\"What about the germs?\" I say. He goes, \"I don't believe in germs. Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!\" Now, he's crazy, right? Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right? That's very sane. I can help you. You want me to, don't you? Get you out?Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right? 'Cause I'd be crazy to escape! I'm all taken care of, see? I've sent out word.I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. LIKE A GUEST! LIKE A PERSON! SHEETS! TOWELS! LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS...Sorry. Really sorry. Got a little agitated. The thought of escaping crossed my mind and suddenly...suddenly I felt LIKE BENDING THE FUCKING BARS BACK, RIPPING OFF THE GODDAMN WINDOW FRAMES AND...EATING THEM, YES, EATING THEM, AND LEAPING, LEAPING...You dumb assholes! I'm a mental patient! I'm supposed to act out. Wait til you morons find out who I am. My father's gonna be really upset. AND WHEN MY FATHER GETS UPSET, THE GROUND SHAKES! MY FATHER IS GOD! I WORSHIP MY FATHER.Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.Wiping cut the human race! That's a great idea! But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals. I didn't say a word about \"you know what\".You know -- your plan.What're you writing? You a reporter?A lawsuit? You going to sue them?Get it? Monk - Key. Monk! Key!Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load! Listen up -- try and get it together. Focus! Focus! The plan! Remember? I did my part.Not, \"what\", babe! When!Now!YES -- NOW! BUY NOW! STOCKS AND BONDS! NO MORE MONKEY BUSINESS -- BUY NOW.YES, YES. ENHANCE YOUR PORTFOLIO NOW!BUY! SELL! SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY!OPPORTUNITY! DEFINITELY! A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY! OPENING NOW! NOW'S THE TIME FOR ALL GOOD MEN TO SEIZE THE MOMENT! YES! YES! MASTERCARD! VISA! THE KEY TO HAPPINESS!SEIZE THE MOMENT! GET RICH! NOW'S THE TIME! GO FOR IT!LAST CHANCE! LAST CHANCE! HEY -- OW!What are you talking about? What friend? I'm not expecting anyone.This is ridiculous. My father is making a major address.Never saw him before in my life. Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles. See, he definitely doesn't know me. Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.Excuse me -- what did you say?Arnold...Arnold.My God, Arnie, what's happened to you? You look like shitOf course I know him. What do you think -- I act like this to strangers? Listen -- you fellas are terrific. I thought you were pulling a number on me. What a terrible thing if you'd thrown old Arnie out. I owe you guys the big apologia! Mea culpa, fellas. Christ, Arnie, it's black tie! I mean, I said, \"drop by,\" but, like, this is Dad's big \"do\"...vips, senators, secret service, and...and everything.Arnold Pettibone. Old Arnie Pettibone. Used to be my best friend. Still is. What've you lost, Arnie -- forty pounds? No wonder I didn't know you. You hungry? Lots of dead cow, dead lamb, dead pig. Real killer feast we're putting on tonight.Hey, nice ta see ya. Lookin' good! Hi, there. Yes, it has been a long time.County Hospital, right? 1989. The \"Immaculate Escape\" -- am I right? Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.We need to talk. Come on. Upstairs. I am a new person! I'm completely adjusted. Witness the tux. It's Armani. Who chattered? Goines? Weller?Come on, follow me. You don't lock so good.I get it! This is your old plan, right?Remember? We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, \"Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?\" You do remember that, don't you?And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, \"Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!\"You're right! Absolutely right. Me's a nut case, totally deranged. Delusional! Paranoid. HIS PROCESSOR'S ALL FUCKED UP, HIS INFORMATION TRAY IS JAMMED.YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, THE \"ARMY OF THE TWELVE MONKEYS\"?

What about walkie talkies? We used to have walkie talkies.You get the bolt cutters?You really want to know?WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND. THIS IS IMPORTANT.Ex-psychiatrist! Now, what about flashlights? How many flashlights...?WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ONHere's my theory on that. While I was institutionalized, my brain was studied exhaustively in the guise of mental health. I was interrogated, x-rayed, studied thoroughly. Then, everything about me was entered into a computer where they created a model of my mind.Now I have to get going -- do my part. You guys check all this stuff out and load up the van. Make sure you have everything. I'm outta here.Let's do it!Okay, that's Stage One. In Stage Two, Monkey Four is over here...Ah, but cruelty is his specialty.Want the full effect?What...virus?What virus are we talking about, Dad?You \"develop\" viruses and you're calling me insane? Typical. What does this virus attack? Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter. Have I ever \"developed\" a virus? Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements? Wow!
