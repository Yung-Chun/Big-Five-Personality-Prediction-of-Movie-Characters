May I have a word??In private, if you don't mind...Your men -- They'll need these --Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.I abhor violence. Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --\"Paranormal\" But -- you read the transmission.I have seen ghosts, Whitman.They must be here for the sheep.Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.If he's here, this is worse than I thought.We don't have forty minutes.(fierce whisper, toNo. It's not.Cordon off the area. Something came through.There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs. In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.No. It was red. Bright red.It's-not-an-ape --I think that is its hand.Wait --It's a boy. Just a baby boy.HELLBOY.Approximately... how long??I'd rather... stay home, you know. I'll be making arrangements -- For my son.That won't be necessary.Son...Four books at once. Every day -- as long as I'm here to turn the pages. My name's Broom. Professor Trevor Broom.-- He. Not \"it.\"Abraham Sapien. Discovered alive in a secret chamber at St. Trinian's Foundling Hospital, Washington.They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence \"Abe\" Sapien.Rotten eggs, a delicacy. Abe loves them.Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe. \"Unique.\" That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --Impressive. Do you remember what it said?\"In the absence of light, darkness prevails.\" For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers. We are the ones who bump back.1937: Hitler joins \"The Thule Society\" -- a group of German aristocrats obsessed with the occult.1938: he acquires the Spear of Longinus, which pierced the body of Christ. He who holds it becomes invincible.Hitler's power increases tenfold.In 1943, President Roosevelt decides to fight back. THE BUREAU FOR PARANORMAL RESEARCH AND DEFENSE is born.1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.Did he, now?Agent Myers, this is Agent Clay. Follow his lead.I hand-picked you from a roster of over seventy academy graduates. Make me proud.Apparently not everything was fake.A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.I thought you liked being on TV.Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.He's just going through a phase --I know where to find him. I'll get him back.Show me, Abe... show me.I don't want Hellboy to know --Sixty years ago Abe, they tried to destroy the world. And they are back -- in my lifetime, they are back. To finish the job.Then he should make it his business to change that.Son. About Rasputin --Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.I worry about you.Well, I won't be around forever, you know?Don't look! Turn around.We can't risk it: You'll go back to the tracks tomorrow with a group of agents, search the area, top to bottom.You're doing fine.I'm dying Agent Myers.And as a father, I worry about him. In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...What I ask from you is -- Have the courage to stand by his side after I'm gone. Help him find himself. Who he must be. He was born a Demon... You will help him become a man.That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.It's her choice -- She's human --Welcome back.Come and go as you please. Find your way back. We've made quite a few changes --The subject: Karl Ruprecht Kroenen --Suffered a masochistic compulsion known as surgical addiction.Both eyelids were surgically removed along with his upper and lower lips, making speech impossible. The blood in his veins dried up decades ago. Only dust remains. Four pulverized vertebrae. A steel rod inserted into his pelvis held him up. What horrible will power could keep a thing like this alive?No. Enough. He will never change -- always a child. Always.SEBASTIAN PLACKBA #16... Moscow.It's Rasputin's mausoleum.I see the puppet. But -- where is... the puppet master?It was you: The scraps of paper, Liz's sudden relapse and return...Moscow.I know what to call him. Nothing you can say or do will change that.
