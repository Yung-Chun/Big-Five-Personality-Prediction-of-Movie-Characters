{"Pirates-of-the-Caribbean": {"ELIZABETH": {"raw_line": "...drink up me hearties, yo, ho...I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.Actually, I find it all fascinating.Yes, father.I still think it would be exciting to meet a pirate...Look! A boy! In the water!Boy overboard!My name is Elizabeth Swann.I'm watching over you, Will.You're a pirate.His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.Yes -- yes.Ceremony?I knew it.Difficult ... to say.Women in London must have learned to not breath.Will! It's so good to see you!I dreamt about you last night. Will reacts with surprise: \"Really?About the day we met. Do you remember?Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?Good day, Mr. Turner.I can't breathe.Yes -- yes, I'm fine -- Commodore Norrington, do you intend to kill my rescuer?Commodore, I must protest. Pirate or not, this man saved my life.You are despicable.Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine! Go capture him.Thank you, Father ... and let that be the last of your fashion advice, please.Nice and toasty. Thank you, Estrellia.Listen, Estrella -- they haven't seen you. Hide, and first chance, run for the fort .Please, no ...Par. .. Parlay!Parlay! I invoke the right of parlay! According to\" the Code of the Brethren, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!If an adversary demands parley, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.I am here to --Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.I want you to leave. And never come back.Very well.I'll drop it!Because it's what you're searching for. You've been searching for it for years. I recognize this ship.Fine. I suppose if this is worthless, there's no reason to keep it.Elizabeth - Turner. I'm a maid in the governor's household. Barbossa reacts to the name Turner: it confirms what he has suspected. The other pirates surreptitiously exchange glances and nods.Thank you, sir.Of course. I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.Can I trust you?Our bargain. . ?Wait! You must return me to shore! According to the rules of the Order of the Brethren -Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.It's poisoned!Then why aren't you eating?It's a pirate medallion.That's all very interesting, but I hardly believe in ghost stories any more.The curse drove you to gather this?No.You?!You're in league with Barbossa!You?!Truthfully -- you were a bit late.Come on!... you were in danger ... so I took the medallion. And I've kept it ever since. They thought I was you, that they needed my blood. And it didn't work.To keep it away from them? No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.-- then we never would have met.I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.No!Will -- you can't trust him.Here -- it will go well with your black heart !I will not walk into the ocean. You'll have to throw me in!You went back for that? We need to head for the reef!Has it changed since the last time you were here?I hope you have no intention of using that.Captain Sparrow! We have to get off this island -- immediately!What is that? Is there a boat under there?What? What's wrong? How will this help us get off the island?But ... you did it before! Last time -So that's it? That's the secret grand adventure of the infamousA month? Will doesn't have a month! We've got to do something to help him!Not when you can drink instead, at least.And you will call me Miss Swann.Drink up me hearties, yo ho...Nothing ... it's nothing. Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child. A song about pirates.Oh, no ... it's silly. Back in England we didn't know a thing about pirates, really. They seemed so romantic and daring -That was before I met one, of course.Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...We pillage, we plunder, we rifle, we loot, Drink up me hearties, yo ho.We kidnap and ravage and we don't give a hoot, Drink up me hearties, yo ho -You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.To freedom.Yes, the rum is gone.One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two -That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction. The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could mass it?Exactly.Just you wait, Captain. In an hour, maybe two, keep a 'weather eye open' and you'll be seeing white sails on that horizon!He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.No. The pirates have taken Will -Commodore, please!Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me. As a wedding gift.Not as a condition -- a request.What?And now I know... where yours does, as well.Then I can wear men's clothing.Well, I am not going to stay hidden in a some cabin, 80 I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare ankles for the remainder of the voyage!You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.What's your plan?You're all right!Yes, I am wearing trousers. And as for how we got off the island -- ah, that's a grand adventure, but now is not the time to talk about it.There. And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!It doesn't!", "clean_line": "drink hearties yo ho think exciting meet pirate actually fascinating yes father think exciting meet pirate look boy water boy overboard elizabeth swann watching pirate turner yes yes ceremony knew difficult women london learned breath good dreamt night reacts surprise day met remember times ask elizabeth good day mr turner breathe yes yes fine commodore norrington intend kill rescuer commodore protest pirate man saved life despicable yes right fine capture thank father let fashion advice nice toasty thank estrellia listen estrella haven seen hide chance run fort par parlay parlay invoke right parlay according code brethren set pirates morgan bartholomew captain adversary demands parley harm parlay complete captain barbossa come negotiate cessation hostilities port royal want leave come ll drop searching ve searching years recognize ship fine suppose worthless reason elizabeth turner maid governor household barbossa reacts turner confirms suspected pirates surreptitiously exchange glances nods thank sir course steal mean trust bargain wait return shore according rules order brethren tell captain disinclined acquiesce request poisoned aren eating pirate medallion interesting hardly believe ghost stories curse drove gather league barbossa truthfully bit late come danger took medallion ve kept thought needed blood work away pirate sail london fear execution dock met guess truly know heart trust black heart walk ocean ll throw went need head reef changed time hope intention captain sparrow island immediately boat wrong help island time secret grand adventure infamousa month month ve got help drink instead miss swann drink hearties yo ho reminded song learned child song pirates oh silly england know thing pirates romantic daring met course bit drink pillage plunder rifle loot drink hearties yo ho kidnap ravage hoot drink hearties yo ho ll positively fearsome pirates sail spanish main jack terrible trapped island freedom yes rum gone vile drink turns respectable men scoundrels signal thousand feet high means seen leagues direction entire royal navy sea looking think chance mass exactly wait captain hour maybe weather eye open ll seeing white sails horizon locate isla muerta doubt ll willing help brig pirates taken commodore commodore beg wedding gift condition request know wear men clothing going stay hidden cabin suppose going heaving bosoms bare ankles remainder voyage tell commodore norrington delay rescue late men facing enemy seemingly killed plan right yes wearing trousers got island ah grand adventure time talk dare tell wasn proper kiss"}, "JACK": {"raw_line": "It's remarkable how often those two traits coincide.What do you say to three shillings, and we forget the name?Sorry, I didn't know.Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh? You two weren't invited?This must be some important boat.Ship.That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that -- -- makes this one here just a wee superfluous.That so? I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, nigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl?I'm sorry. It's just such a pretty boat. Ship.Smith.None? Very well. You've rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go out on the account, do a little honest pirating.Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't believe the truth if he told it to you.Aren't you going to save her?Sailors.Fine.Don't lose these.Clearly, you've never been to Singapore.Where did you get this?Captain Jack Sparrow. If you please.Ah, but you have heard of me.But it seems to be enough to condemn him.Finally.Commodore Norrington ... my pistol and belt, please.Commodore!Elizabeth -- it is Elizabeth?Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?Now, if you'll be very kind?I saved your life; now you've saved mine. We're square.Gentleman. .. m' lady. .. you will always remember this as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow.You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?Ah. Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record. So if you'll excuse me ...Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?Only a little.You know what you're doing, I'll give you that ... Excellent form ... But how's your footwork? If I step here -Very good! And if I step again, you step again. . .Ta!That's a good trick. Except, once again, you are between me and the way out. And now you have no weapon.Who makes all these?You need to find yourself a girl. Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?Move away.Move!You're lucky, boy -- this shot's not meant for you.You can keep doing that forever, that dog's never going to move.I know those guns!It's the Black Pearl.There are a lot of stories about the Black Pearl.It's all right, doggie ... come here,What's the matter, boy?Worry about your own fortunes. The lowest circle of hell is reserved for betrayers ... and mutineers.You are cursed.The stories are true.Somewhat.Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.Why ask me?And you want to turn pirate yourself?So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone. I see no profit in it for me.How? The key's run off.Your name is Turner.Will Turner... I'll tell you what, Mr. Turner. I've changed my mind. You spring me from this cell, and on pain of death, I'll you to the Black Pearl. Do we have an accord?Agreed!Not without my effects.My business, Will. As for your business -one question, or there's no use going. This girl -- what does she mean to you? How far are you willing to go to save her?Good.Ah, now there's a lovely sight!I knew the Harbormaster wouldn't report her. Honest men are slaves to their conscience, and there's no predicting 'em. But you can always trust a dishonest man to stay that way...Come aboard.No worries there. She's far more likely to rot out from under us.Besides, we are about to better our prospects considerably.Commandeer. We're going to commandeer a ship. Nautical term.Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.Everybody stay calm. We're taking over the ship!Dead serious.We'll see about that.Fine by me. We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.As likely as not. Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!A little help?Lookee there, mate! We're underway!Can you swim? Can. You. Swim?Good.Thank you, Commodore, for getting our ship ready to make way! We'd've had a hard time of it by ourselves!For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.Is that so?I knew him. Probably one of the few who knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.Good man. Good pirate. And clever -\"- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.I swear, you look just like him.Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectableSure -- because he could always go pirating.Put it away, Will. It's not worth getting beat again.Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it?What a man can do. And what a man can I t do.For instance: you can accept that your father was a pirate and still a good man... or you can't. Now me, I can sail this ship to Tortuga, by myself. . . But I can't just let you drown.Oh -- did I forget to mention that?Don't worry. I've already got my Quartermaster -- there!AnaMaria! Have you seen Gibbs? I need to put together -Borrowed. Borrowed your boat. Without permission.Safe! At Port Royal. With the Royal Navy.You'll get it back. Or one better.Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it. The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.Just the one.Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?I'm going after the Black Pearl.Ilm going after the Black Pearl. I know where its going to be, and I'm going to take it.Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to. All I need is a crew.Back there, guarding the door is the son of old Bootstrap Bill Turner.That he is.Mr. Cotton. Do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders and stay true, in the face danger, and almost certain death?These are the only ones worth having. And we're going to need them-She can hold a bit longer.We're catching up!Bear three points starboard.Six points port!I didn't!My body's still there, rotting away, and I am but a ghost!Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.The pistol. When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot. No good for hunting, or surviving, really. But after three weeks of starvation and thirst -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.But I survived. And I still have that single shot. It's meant for one man. My mutinous first mate -They'll be anchored on the lee side. Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island -Depends.On whether the stories are all true. If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon. If not --- well, too late.Chalk one up for the stories.Me!No, I'm -- rescuing you.This way!The trick isn't getting here, it's getting away.I'll lead them away.Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship. I'll keep 'em busy.I'm sure. When you've led the kind of life I have, there are debts that must be paid. Maybe I can balance the scales a little.I invoke the right of parlay, according to the Code of the Brethren, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew...The woman's blood didn't work, did it?I know who's blood you need, to end the curse.No you won't.Simple. I have something you want more than anything. The way to free you from the curse of the treasure. You have something I want -- more than anything.You give me the Pearl. Then I tell you who you need.That's right.I'm a man of my word.You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse. Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?Wait as long as you like.Let's say I tell you the wrong person. What would you do?And if I tell you the truth, you become mortal, and you won't come near me because you know I'd kill you.See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.What -- you don't have the medallion?I'll watch my back.Don't hit my ship! I mean, kill the lying scoundrel - I'm a little conflicted, here.It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime. No good can come of it.Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.The last time you did this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.A gentleman might give us two pistols, seeing as there are two of us, this time.You can go to your grave not knowing.That's the second time I've had to watch that man sail away with my ship.Not all that big, is it?The trees are taller.Not yet. Ask me again in a few weeks.It won't. It won't, and so we won't.Last time, I was here a grand total of three days. Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.But from the looks of this, they've long been'out of business, and so that won't be happening again. We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.Welcome to the Caribbean, love.You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord. We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again. And we've got rum, praise the Lord. We can stay alive a month, maybe more. Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.You're right. Here's luck to you, Will Turner.Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth. But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.What? What was that? Something funny, Miss Swann? share. Please,I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child. Let's hear it.More to drink!Well?I LOVE this song! Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me! We're beggars and blighters,When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!Not just the Spanish Main. The whole ocean. .. the whole world. Wherever we want to go, we go. That's what a ship is, you know. Not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails. That's what a ship need_ ... but what a ship is -- what the Black Pearl really-is ... is freedom.Ah, well... the company is better than last time. And the scenery has definitely improved.We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.To the Black Pearl.What are you doing? You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?We had time to get to know each other.Congratulations, sir.Nor did you, I noticed.Exactly.I have a plan. If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.Funny, I was thinking along those lines. How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.They left me stranded. Twice. What have you got to lose?I knew you'd listen to reason!That chart I drew up'11 get you past the reefs. If you're steersman's good enough, that is.I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.Do you have any idea where you're going?Don't talk. These caves magnify sound. Just follow me.It's the right way.You don't want to be doing that.All right then.Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.- - and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.Simple. Don't kill the boy yet. Wait for a more opportune moment.Like after you've killed... Every... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.The situation has changed.Aye. See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do? Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue? The Dauntless a first-rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas.I sail for you as part of your fleet, I give you fifteen percent of my plunder, and you get to introduce yourself at tea parties and brothels as 'Commodore Barbossa.' Do we have an accord?Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?There's ... another exit?Oh, please -- do I really seem that clever?Use it well.Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.Well, isn't that interesting.They're so pretty, I just couldn't resist stealing one. It's a curse, I guess.Or you could surrender.The worst. On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants. Now that's a great pirate.Tough luck. I was rooting for you.AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail - you and Cotton.
