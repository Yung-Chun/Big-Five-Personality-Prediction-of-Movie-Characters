She was great in The Last Picture Show.She's a very good Actress.Yeah. Why's that?What would that be?No, I just like my questions to be answered.While I've got you both here. Sirs, I'd like to be an Undercover Detective.Whatever Department works, Sir.I know, Sir but I think I could do some good there.Well, I'm young. I think there's a niche for me. Get In where I can Fit In.Just trying to be of help, Chief. Plus, I hate working in The Records room. Sgt. Trapp reacts knowing Ron shouldn't have said that about the Records Room. CHIEF BRIDGES looks at Ron, matter of fact.Chief, want me clean shaven?No Toads here.I said, I don't have any Toads. I do have Human Beings and if you give me their names I can pull the Files.Hello.Yes, Chief, I was. Just worked a Night Shift.Yes Sir, see you then. Thank You. Thank You.Sorry, it won't happen again.The Nightclub?Born Ready.Any chance this thing Fucks Up?Then what?Which is?You mean a Joint?\"Soul Brother, I'm already High on Life.

You with The Black Student Union?Right On. Right On.Rum and Coke with Lime.Right on!!! Right On!!!Brother Ture, do you really think a War between The Black and White Race is inevitable? Kwame pulls Ron in close toward his face. Too close.I don't know what you have planned now but maybe I could buy you a Drink?I can dig it.I do.Cool. All Power to All The People.Say what?True?Did you see the Officer's names?I'm sorry.Folks were hanging on every word.But I'm not sure that means Black Folks were ready to start a Revolution.Nobody was talking about that. That wasn't the Mood. Everybody was Cool.Yeah, he said that but I think that was just talk. You know, Rhetoric.Kwame Ture.He changed his name from Stokely Carmichael to Kwame Ture.Did you hear the Story Patrice told me about how the CSPD pulled over her and Ture?Kwame Ture, Correct.Just doing my job, Chief. Undercover.I would never jeopardize a Case...What will I be doing, Chief?Hello, this is Ron Stallworth calling. Saw your Advertisement in The Colorado Springs Gazette. I'm interested in receiving some Reading Materials. My Phone Number is 403- 9994. Looking forward to you returning my call. God Bless White America.Motherfucker!!!I wasn't.The Organization?Since you asked- I Hate Niggers, Jews, Mexicans, Spics, Chinks but especially those Niggers and anyone else that does not have pure White Aryan Blood running through their Veins.In fact, my Sister, Pamela, was recently accosted by a Nigger......Every time I think about that Black Baboon putting his Filthy Black Hands on her White as Pure Driven Snow Body I wanna Puke!!!How about Friday night? After I get off work?Looking forward to meeting you.Well... they want to meet me First.I'll need another Undercover to go in my place.You think?Damn.Why so, Chief?What does a Black Man talk like?...If you don't mind, I'd like to talk for myself, Thank You. How exactly does a Black Man talk?Chief, some of us can speak King's English and Jive. I happen to be fluent in both.I have established contact and created some familiarity with The Klansmen over the phone. I will continue that role but another Officer, a White Officer, will play Me when they meet Face to Face.Black Ron Stallworth on The phone and White Ron Stallworth Face to Face, so there becomes a combined Ron Stallworth.I believe we can... With The Right White Man.I'm sorry. It won't happen again.Can we move on to the Bio, please.Whereabout?KWYD. Christian Talk in The Morning, although the Signal starts to cut out near Pueblo. On the way back I go for 102.7 to get my Allman Brothers Fix. Only I have to change every time that British Fag David Bowie pipes on.Remember you've got to retain the details of what you share with them so I can be White Ron Stallworth.Well, don't share your Love of The Brothers with these Guys. For you, it's The Osmonds.Fair? I get to play you and Jimmy and all the other guys in the Station... Everyday.Who are you meeting?Become Walter's Friend, get invited back.I'm on the phone with The Klan, You see them in person......And you need to sound like my voice.Just repeat after me.Look a'here, some people say we got a lot of malice. Some say it's a lotta nerve.I saw we won't quit moving 'Til we get what we deserve.We've been buked and we've been scorned. We've been treated bad, talked about.As Just as sure as you're born But just as sure as it take.Two eyes to make a pair, huh.Brother, we can't quit until we get our share.Say it loud. I'm Black and I'm proud.Jimmy, join us.You're Jewish?It's Walter. Ron writes down The Truck's PlateJust a Bar.Think he got a good look at My Face?Mad at Sanford and Son and Flip Wilson.Lost the damn signal.They liked you.You got The Papers? They want you to join.They want a Black Man to join The Ku Klux Klan. I'd call that Mission Impossible. Double Success.Enough that we'd like to dig deeper. One of the Men discussed plans for a possible Attack...Either way, we're looking for full support from The Department.I don't really use that word.Pigs.Cops... Police...So you think all Cops are Racist?He's got some good ideas. I don't agree with all of them but he's a smart Brother who's worth hearing.Do we always have to talk about Politics?Do you ever take any time off from The Liberation of Black People?Sista Angela Davis, can we spend some quality time together.Kathleen Cleaver, I didn't?You mean A Cop?NO I'm a Black Man who wants to get to know A Strong, Intelligent, Beautiful Sister.This is Ron.Allergies acting up again.I'm honored.Davis?Political Office? How so?...Keep going.America would never elect somebody like Devin Davis President of the United States of America?Shit. He turns the ignition and drives forward. INT. INT. DEN - FELIX'S HOUSE - DAYIs he gonna hear about it, Sarge?And he didn't.Flip, it's Intel.This is the Job. What's your problem?How's that?Why haven't you bought into this?Because you're Jewish, Brother. The So-Called Chosen People. Flip gets pissed and flies up into Ron face. They are nose to nose.You're passing, Man.You're passing for a WASP!!! White Anglo Saxon Protestant, All-American Hot Dog, Cherry Pie White Boy. It's what some Light-Skinned Black Folks do, they pass for White.Doesn't that Hatred The Klan say Piss you off.Then why you acting like you ain't got skin in the Game!It's our Business.I'm gonna get your Membership Card so you can go on this Cross Burning and get in deeper, right Flip?Good afternoon. My name is Ron Stallworth, calling from Colorado Springs. How are you today, Sir?I'm calling because I desperately want to participate in my Chapter's Honorary Events but I can't until I receive my Membership Card.Thank you. Who am I speaking with?I'm sorry... did you just say you're Devin Davis?...Grand Wizard of The Ku Klux Klan? That Devin Davis?Really? National Director too?I'm honored to be speaking with you. I'm not afraid to say it...I consider you a True White American Hero.Amen, Mr. Davis. Seems like there's less and less of us these days. Now about that Membership Card...That Cop that pulled Kwame Ture over that night... was it Landers?I can smell em' a Mile away now.Yeah?Flip, why do you tolerate this?Yeah, reminds me of another Group. Ron finished. Flip steps away buttoning his shirt.Bernie Casey's a Badd Brother....And Tamara Dobson played a Cop.You don't dig Pam Grier? She's Fine as Wine and twice as Mellow.What if a Cop was trying to make things better.Yeah, from the inside.So just give up?Can't you do that from the inside!I know how that feels. I'm Two damn people all the time!Because we're not there yet!Shaft or Superfly?Pick one, Shaft or Superfly?Richard Roundtree or Ron O'Neal?Ron O'Neal isn't a Pimp. He's just playing one.JESUS CHRIST!!! Give it a rest.Nobody.What?You're right, I'm messin' up. Hate to violate that Blue Wall of Silence.Is Patrice a Target?We got Active Duty Soldiers from Fort Carson. Going to the CID with this.Our Mystery Boys Steve and Jerry. Still don't know who they are.We got Felix's Old Klan Crew.And we got new Klan Walter.Oh Hell yeah!!!That's my Ace Boon Coon Running Partner! And now that you got that Ronny Boy. We are on a Roll, Baby!!!That's us The Stallworth Boys.I called to warn you, but you must have already taken off.Where'd you find them?It's Real.Clearly, this is about the Black Student Union and you.You've been outspoken about the incident with the Police when Brother Kwame was here.They're trying to get to you, like you said they want to intimidate make themselves feared. If you don't let 'em scare you. They got nothing. But keep your eyes open. Be Cool.Maybe the both of you should call The Cops.Send another one.Good job, Men.That surprises me.Sounds like she was a Mammy to you.You were Scarlett and she was Mammy.A good Nigger's funny that way. In that sense they're like a Dog. They can get real close to you and when you lose em'. Just breaks your heart.I knew a Nigger once.Yeah. Nigger lived across the street from us. I must of been Six or Seven. His nickname was Butter Biscuit.He loved his Mama's Butter Biscuits.Me and Butter Biscuit played together everyday. One day My Father came home early from work and told me I couldn't play with him anymore because I was White and Butter Biscuit was a Nigger.Ain't it.Thanks, Buddy.Amen.Absolutely. Sure wish we had the chance to chat Face to Face.You'll be in Colorado Springs?That would be quite an Honor.I'll have to think about this. My father is very ill and he lives in El Paso. I won't have the time.El Paso, Flip, El Paso...I'm anxious to meet you and it will be something I share with my Family for Generations to come.Say, Mr. Davis... I just have to ask. Aren't you ever concerned about some Smart-Aleck Negro calling you and pretending to be White?How so?Any examples?You are so White... Right. I want to thank you for this Lesson because if you had not brought it to my attention, I would never have noticed the difference between how We talk and how Negroes talk.From now on I'm going to pay close attention to my Telephone conversations so I can make sure I'm not talking to one of dem' Sneaky Coloreds.You okay?I would love to continue this conversation when you are in Colorado Springs. Beautiful here, Sir. God's Country.You too, Sir. God Bless White America. Ron hangs up, laughing. He calls to Sgt. Trapp:It's over!!! You can come back!!!Hello?Not at all. Just... finishing a Meal.Agent... Y? EXT. OLD ABANDONED BREWSTER'S FACTORY - DAYWhat is this about?The Two Mystery men. Steve and Jerry?Klan...?We thought they might pull something. But not like this?If you know about an attack, I need to know when.But... can't you, The FBI pitch in?You can hate me all you want to, just promise me you won't go to The Protest.I can't say specifics but today, The Klan is planning an Attack.Not an option.No one can know while it's an Active Investigation...I'm not a Cop....I'm a Undercover Detective. I've been investigating The Klan.Ron Stallworth is my first and last name. Today's not the day...All the good it does. You could sit in the middle of Nevada Avenue and set yourself on Fire and The Klan will still be here.Unlike Me? Don't think because I'm not wearing a Black Beret, Black Leather Jacket and Black Ray Bans screaming \"KILL WHITEY\" doesn't mean I don't care about my People.Patrice...I'm a Undercover Detective for The Colorado Springs Police Department. It's my J-O-B.The March?What's going on?Felix just said the March was cancelled.They're used to that.No.What's more important than preventing an Attack?I don't think that's a wise decision...A Clusterfuck.Man, who you think you're talking to. You've been trying to sabotage me since Day One.Who you callin' Boy?I'm Mr. Davis' Security Detail.Hello, Mr. Davis. I'm a Detective from The Colorado Springs Police Department and I will be acting as your Bodyguard today.As you may know, there have been several credible Threats against your Well-Being.Let me be clear, Mr. Davis: I do not agree with your Philosophies. However I am a Professional and I will do everything within my means and beyond to keep you safe....Mr. Davis, a favor to ask. Nobody's gonna believe me when I tell them I was your Bodyguard.Care to take a Photo with me?You mind taking it, Sir?If you lay one Finger on me, I'll arrest you for assaulting a Police Officer. That's worth about Five Years in Prison. Try me. See if I'm playing.Thanks for the Photo, Mr. Davis. Big Fan. God Bless WHITE AMERICA.Attention all Units.

Been having some trouble lately with these Local Niggers.Makes me Sick.But it's also the, like, camaraderie I'm looking for...with The Klan.Camaraderie...?The Klan...?I overstand... Right. The Organization.What?Pull out what?Ready to go....The Organization.I appreciate you inviting me out.I meant every word I said.That right?...FUCK. How 'bout just Fuckin'? Niggers. Make it Fuckin' simple.I been saying this stuff for years.You don't know how good it is to hear someone that gets it.What kinda stuff you Guys do?I'm tired of people Fuckin' with me.Some...I could know more.How so?Gotcha.Where to?Now we're talkin'.Alcoa Can't wait.I can't thank you Brothers enough.You trying to offend me?'Course I'm no Stinkin' Kike.Stop fuckin' 'round.You have me dressed like one of the Beverly Hillbillies for Chrissakes. I felt too Redneck for those Guys.Except for that Felix Guy. Do not ride his Bumper like that! Two car lengths!Technically they want you to join....I wouldn't give him that much credit. These Yahoos like to Boast.Ivanhoe said \"BOOM\", mentioned something about Fireworks. Personally, I didn't buy it. Doubt they're even capable.Great to meet you....That'd be a tremendous Honor. Where?Wow. This is really... something.That's a Remington Model 1900.Where...uh...where ya takin' me? I told you already I'm not thrilled with you callin' me a Jew.What is this your Jew Den?

Stoppin' some Jerkoffs from playing Dress up?I'm not risking my Life to prevent some Rednecks from lighting a couple Sticks on Fire.Ron, you're my problem.For you it's not a job, it's a Crusade. It's not personal nor should it be.Why should I?What?Of course it does.That's my Damn Business!How'd you know?He's been a Bad Cop for a long time.Does that kinda' Shit all the time. Few years ago, he allegedly Shot and Killed a Black Kid... he said he had a Gun. The Kid wasn't the type.We're a family. Good or Bad. We stick together.

Come by sometime we'll have a Coors.That Fuckin' Cunt.Yeah, after I get em' 'round da Head of my Dick.Are you Fucking kidding me?You don't cross those lines. This is about an Investigation. Not a... Relationship.Nice one.Maybe.Walter's a General without an Army. Felix's Crew is stronger than him.You've really been talking to Devin Davis?Yeah, funny, but you didn't have psychopath staring at you asking where you lived.Ron, I wasn't raised Jewish. It wasn't a part of my Life. So I never thought much about being Jewish, was just another White Kid, didn't even have my Bar Mitzvah. No Chanukah for me. Christmas. In this job, you try to keep things at a distance. You put up a Shield so you don't feel anything... This shit is deep. When that Fuck Felix had me in that room and I kept having to deny my heritage...I have been passing. OMITTED.Must be quite a sight.A lot of these Guys in The Army?Just finished my Second Tour in Nam.Enough to make shit BLOW UP. Flip stops talking. He might've revealed a bit too much.It's a Big Honor but I can't accept. Problem is, what you Good Men need is a President who will be constant, on CALL Day In, Day Out. I'll be back and forth between here and Dallas.Did I say Dallas?Dallas is where my Plane layover is. El Paso is where my sick Father is.I just hope my Father isn't cared for by some Texicano Spic Nurse.I don't carry it on me All The Time.Won't happen again.What's gonna happen next Sunday?Fuck ya'.Thanks for sharing.Why?And there's been nothing more about explosives?Chief, it's not about that and you know it. Devin Davis and Ron have been speaking over the phone, several times. If he recognizes his voice... or if any of The Klansmen do, it could compromise Our Entire Investigation.You as well.Yes.I am a White, Non-Jewish American Citizen. CUT TO:Boy you get ya' ass out NOW!No, I don't believe we've ever met.No, sorry, I can't place you.We were in Prison together. Years ago.
