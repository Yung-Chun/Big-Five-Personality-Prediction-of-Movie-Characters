{"White-Ribbon-The": {"PAUSE.": {"raw_line": "RUDOLPH: Is she dead too?XENIA: Yes. She's dead too. But that was a long time ago. Both remain SILENT. In the meantime it has grown dark in the kitchen. Suddenly, Rudolph brushes away his plate off the table with an angry movement, and turns away from Xenia. The plate shatters on the floor. At first Xenia is stunned, paralyzed. Then she starts to sob, but tries to hide it from her brother.DOCTOR: Has she taken good care of you? XENIA: Yes. PAUSE. The doctor turns to Xenia: DOCTOR: How old are you now? XENIA: Fourteen. The doctor looks at her, laughs silently and shakes his head. Again he looks out on the fields. After a while he says: DOCTOR: It's amazing how much you look like your mother. Xenia remains silent. Suddenly she whispers:MIDWIFE: It was difficult with the children, without you. DOCTOR: I know. MIDWIFE: He doesn't like me. DOCTOR: Who? MIDWIFE: Rudi. DOCTOR : He's at a difficult age. MIDWIFE: Actually not. PAUSE. Then: They're always at a difficult age. DOCTOR : Yes.DOCTOR: There's nothing like a nice dose of self-hate. MIDWIFE: What? DOCTOR: Nothing. Forget it.LIESL : When did you go down to see Father? Down in his office. FERDINANWell. And why are you so focused on that girl? She's almost still a child. You could almost be her father. SCHOOLTEACHER : I'm thirty-one. FATHER : Well, you can still handle what matters. MOTHER : Father! Eva and the schoolteacher don't know where to look. FATHER: Let's be serious: do you know whether she's willing to get married. She's still a child. She hasn't seen anything of the world. To Eva: Say something. Do you want him? Eva wishes the earth would engulf her. FATHER: Come on. Don't make such a fuss. He walked all the way over through the fresh snow. MOTHER: Why don't you leave her alone. Of course, she wants him. Can't you feel that?! FATHER: How can I? If she keeps her mouth shut! Eva jumps up and runs out, so as not to burst into tears out of shame. The mother follows her, shaking her head disapprovingly at the father. The schoolteacher stands up, as Eva ran out. He'd rather follow her, but has to remain polite toward the father. The father says calmly:SCHOOLTEACHER says: Did your father tell...? EVA: Yes.SCHOOLTEACHER: Is that all right with you?EVA: Is that all right with you, sir? SCHOOLTEACHER : Don't be so formal with me. Eva looks up. Their eyes meet. Then she takes his hand in her hand. They remain seated without saying a word.MIDWIFE : Why did this only occur to you now? DOCTOR: According to you: when should it have occurred to me? At the hospital, I had forgotten how tiresome you were. One grows sentimental when one's in pain.DOCTOR : Get out. Why don't you get out. Don't you have any pride? MIDWIFE : There's no room for any with you. DOCTOR: That's true. MIDWIFE: Aren't you afraid that I might do something silly? DOCTOR : Go ahead. At least that would surprise me. But be careful: it might be painful. MIDWIFE: I know. I'm ridiculous. You wouldn't care anyway. DOCTOR: Well... She looks at him.LIESL says: Last winter, before Putzl became ill, I dreamt that my brother put him beside the open window, so that he'd die. And the day the window was open and he caught a chill and he almost died.BARON: May I ask you how you plan to do that? BARONESS : I don't know yet. But in any case, we're leaving this place. BARON : We. Look of the Baroness . BARONESS: Yes. The maid enters to clear the rest of the table. It leads to a longer PAUSE. The Baron drinks his brandy, goes to the window, waits. As the maid leaves the room, she looks at the Baroness inquiringly:BARONESS : Do you think that will help us solve the problem? BARON: What? BARONESS: Your sarcasm. BARON: Actually, what is the problem that has to be solved? The Baroness looks at him, then gets up and wants to leave the room. BARON : You stay here!! She turns around, looks at him. BARON : You only leave this room if I tell you to do so. She looks at him. BARONESS: Fine. She goes back to her chair and sits down. BARONESS: I wanted to spare you this, but you force me to do it: During our stay with Uncle Edoardo I fell in love with a man. He's from Lombardy, he works in the banking business and helped Uncle Edoardo in a financial matter. He courted me and was also very fond of the children. If Sigi has blossomed and grown so healthy, it's largely thanks to him. Despite all this, we came back. Because I feel committed to you. But I can't stand this place any longer. Not so much for me personally, though I can't say that life with you is exactly thrilling for a woman of my age. But if I leave this place, it's because I don'tBARON: Did you sleep with him? BARONESS : You don't understand anything. BARON: Did you sleep with him?BARONESS : No. I didn't sleep with him.BARON: You're lying, aren't you? The Baroness looks at him. Then she gets up, about to leave the room again. At the same moment, somebody KNOCKS at the door. After a short gesture of irritation BARON : Come in! The steward appears. STEWARPlease! Lend me the bicycle. SCHOOLTEACHER: Why? What is going on? After hesitating a while MIDWIFE: I have to go to the police in town. I now know who committed all these crimes. SCHOOLTEACHER : Who? MIDWIFE: Will you let me have the bicycle? SCHOOLTEACHER: Why don't you tell me? MIDWIFE: From now on I shall only talk to the police. I won't let them insult me : As you just saw. SCHOOLTEACHER: Can't the doctor can lend you his horse? MIDWIFE: I don't know how to ride. The schoolteacher looks at her inquisitively, because he still doesn't understand what it's all about, but she doesn't respond, and says:SCHOOLTEACHER: But can't you see that the shutters are closed. PAUSE.SCHOOLTEACHER: Go home now. Nobody said you could come in here. The children go out slowly. They open the wooden gate in the fence, and go out into the street. They're visibly embarrassed at being caught by the schoolteacher when they were doing something wrong. Some avoid the schoolteacher's eyes, while others mutter a greeting, as if they wanted to say goodbye, as they went away. The schoolteacher looks annoyed. As Marie steps out of the garden door, he says: SCHOOLTEACHER: You better go back home now, hurry. Marie doesn't seem to feel guilty at all. Again she greets him politely. MARIE: Good evening, Teacher. SCHOOLTEACHER : Good evening. The children go away. The schoolteacher also goes on his way. After a few steps he turns around and looks at the children, then walks on.THE PASTOR'S WIFE: Don't you want to sit down? SCHOOLTEACHER : Yes. Perhaps. With pleasure. They sit down. The children sit opposite the schoolteacher. PASTOR'S WIFE: Can I offer you something? , : A cup of coffee? Like during the piano lessons First the schoolteacher wants to refuse, then he decides to accept so as to get rid of the woman, and be alone with the children. SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes, with pleasure. That's very kind of you. PASTOR'S WIFE: I'll be back in a minute. The schoolteacher turns to the children: SCHOOLTEACHER: Did you know that the Doctor was leaving Eichwald? Short PAUSE. MARIE: No. SCHOOLTEACHER: But you don't seem surprised at my question. MARIE: Our mother told us when she came to fetch us. SCHOOLTEACHER: And Xenia didn't tell you anything about it? MARIE: No. She looks at Martin who confirms it: MARTIN: No. SCHOOLTEACHER : Not a word? It's very unusual for a child not to tell his classmates before going away on a trip. MARIE : Xenia never talks much about home. SCHOOLTEACHER: Well, that's something completely different?!MARTIN: Yes. He isn't well. And since his mother is gone... we thought, we should go and pay him a visit. The schoolteacher realizes that he won't get any further this way. SCHOOLTEACHER: Did you ever ask yourselves who could have treated Hansi that way? PAUSE. Then the schoolteacher adds: And Sigi?And who tied the wire in the doctor's garden? And who set fire to the barn? Well?!MARIE: Yes, of course we wondered. SCHOOLTEACHER: Well? MARIE: We discussed it with Father. He said it must be a sick person. PAUSE. The schoolteacher doesn't know how to go on. SCHOOLTEACHER: Sigi was with you at Thanksgiving. And so was Hansi.MARIE: I don't understand. With demonstrative helplessness she looks at the schoolteacher, then at her brother, and again at the schoolteacher: Shaking her head and shrugging her shoulders. SCHOOLTEACHER: What did they do to you? MARIE : Who?Why do you ask us?SCHOOLTEACHER: You're an intelligent girl, Marie. Don't try and play dumb.MARIE: I don't understand you, Sir. You should talk with Father about this or with Mother. Shall I go get her?SCHOOLTEACHER: When they found the Baron's son... the last time he had been seen, he was with the children. The pastor looks at the schoolteacher, then his face slowly freezes to a mask of refusal: PASTOR: What are you getting at? Of course, the schoolteacher notices the reaction. But he has already gone too far to backtrack. After a PAUSE he goes on: SCHOOLTEACHER: A couple of days before Hansi was almost beaten to death, the steward's daughter had predicted precisely that to me. Supposedly, she had dreamed it. The police thinks she's lying. Who told her about it? Who announced it to her? LONG SILENCE. Finally, the pastor gets up, takes a few steps, then, after another PAUSE, turns again to the schoolteacher. His face is ashen, and he can hardly speak: PASTOR: If I understand you correctly, you're saying that your pupils, my children included, committed these crimes. Is that right? The schoolteacher has little affirmative and regretful gesture. He feels extremely uncomfortable in this role. Another PAUSE. Then, the pastor continues: Do you realize what you're saying? PAUSE. He breathes heavily, tries to control his emotions.
