{"Three-Men-and-a-Baby": {"JACK": {"raw_line": "Oh my God! I can't believe my eyes! Look at these women! Will you look at the gorgeous calves on them?! I'm telling you, give me an athlete any day... Oh God! Look at that redhead over there, and look at that one! Christ, I hadn't noticed her. Paul, I've just fallen madly in love with the most beautiful woman in the world...The blonde over there, she's too gorgeous for words. Just look at those eyes, look at those shoulders and the way she moves. I'm in love. Here, take over, I'll be right back.Hello. I'm the captain of this plane. May I ask your name?Listen, Jane, I've seen many beautiful women in my life but I swear to you, I've never, ever met a woman as exquisite as you are. Jack kneels down before her, and the Girl looks at him, amused. He takes her hand and places it over his heart.Jane, can you feel my heart? It's pounding. This is horrible, I think I'm gonna faint. Listen: I'm madly in love with you, I'm single and here's my phone number. He hands her his business card.I'm putting my fate in your hands. If you don't call me, you'll make me the most miserable man on earth. This is no line and I'm not trying to get you into bed. This is something completely different. I love you Jane and if you call me I'll be the happiest man in the entire universe -- this is 'love at first sight.' Out of all these beautiful women I noticed only you, and... The Girl laughs as Jack goes on. Meanwhile, the Busi- nessman who was seated in the rear of the plane has gotten up and walked over to Jack.No, I'm not.Yes, I'm the pilot... ... I'm not even asking for your phone number...Yeah, the copilot -- he's up front... The Businessman disappears in the direction of the cockpit.I'm leaving it all up to you, Jane, but if you do give me your phone number, then Jane, then... The Businessman has reached the cockpit.I got her phone number! She gave me her phone number!It's wonderful -- Life is wonderful! The Businessman goes back to his seat and Jack grabs hold of the microphone.This is your captain speaking. In honor of your victory, in honor of your beauty, and in honor of Jane, the most beautiful gymnast I have ever met. I'm going to give you a little demonstration of aviation gymnastics -- reserved only for the most important guest, hip, hip... Everyone shouts \"HOORAY!\" except for Paul and theGod, what a woman! Paul is nervous, glancing uneasily from car to car.Wanna share a cab? Paul Yeah, sure! A black Ford pulls up in front of them and its driver looks at Paul who immediately turns his back on him.She's so beautiful! I've never been so in love before. Can you believe she gave me her phone number... Oh, Christ -- where is it?... Oh, no, don't tell me I lost it... It's a matter of life and death... Oh here it is -- thank God! All the while Jack has been rambling on, a beige car on the other side of the street has slowed down. Paul notices it. In the beige car, a narcotics agent, GRATON, is behind the wheel with one of his colleagues sitting beside him.Yeah, sure... Hey, look, will you -- look at that sparkling beauty.She'll never make it with all that luggage she's got. I gotta give her a hand. Look at the colors in her hair! Christ, I've never seen a woman like her before... He's about to walk off when Paul grabs him by the arm.Sure you can, no problem... Listen, I gotta go now, I'm gonna see if she'll share a cab with me. You take the shuttle, okay?Come over to my place tonight. We're having a huge party. Come around 9, okay? See ya later.As exquisite as you are... I think I'm gonna faint. He kneels, takes her hand and puts it over his heart. The young woman is flabbergasted. A lonely-looking Paul hails the shuttle bus.This is no line and I'm not trying to get you into bed. This is something completely different. This is 'love at first sight.' Oh, I'm so happy... Let me go get you a glass of champagne. I'll be right back. Jack gets up and goes over to the buffet. As soon as he's out of the girl's line of sight, he starts running toward the other end of the apartment. On the way he passes MICHAEL, who's deeply engrossed in a vehement conversation about modern art with a girl called SOPHIA. They're fighting like cats and dogs but seem to be enjoy- ing it.I'm having a hard time. I'm working on two at once.The brunette in the armchair in the living room -- her name's Rosalie... MICHAELClementine -- she's waiting for me in the den.Oh, hi, Paul, yeah sure...... Please darling, don't move... I'll be right back, okay? I'll bring us back some champagne... He disappears with Paul.You're a lifesaver, Paul. I thought I'd never get away. Rosalie's waiting for me in the living room. Isn't she terrific?Clementine.Yeah... What kind of favor? Damn, I've got to get her a glass of champagne.Yeah, sure, of course. No, wait, I'm leaving for South America tomorrow. I'll be gone for three weeks.But it's okay. Peter and Michael will be here. They'll take care of it.Absolutely. Don't worry about a thing.Delivered Sunday picked up Thursday. Got it. No problem.Sure. You got it. I'll see you later...Okay, sure, not to anyone at all... Look, I'm sorry Paul, but I gotta get back to Rosalie. Now go have a good time. I'll take care of everything.Don't mention it. Paul leaves. Jack finally reaches the armchair where Rosalie is sitting. He stops short, obviously disappointed.Uh-oh. Too late. Michael is sitting next to Rosalie, right next to her. They get up to dance. As he passes Jack, Michael smiles broadly.Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling Clementine. Jack whirls around and heads back towards Clementine.Nice work if you can get it, and you can get it if you try... Any scotch left?Sorry I can't give you guys a hand, but I've got something cooking.I am, the night's still young!... It's gonna be a lively one. I'm gonna make us a little snack. He makes up a tray with sandwiches.Maxine. Beautiful, enchanting Maxine. Peter and Michael look at one another surprised, mouthing silently, \"Maxine?\"Hey, Michael -- how'd it go with Rosalie?Your old friend Sophia appeared and dragged you into a thrilling conversation about modern art and in the meantime Rosalie took off with someone else.I dunno -- lucky guess...Don't worry, I'll leave you her phone number on the hall table. If she's really terrific I'll put a big 'X' next to it. 'Bye, guys -- love ya. I won't wake you tomorrow morning. See you in three weeks...Damn! I forgot to tell them about the package! I gotta make a quick phone call. I'll be right back.Oh, c'mon, I've really got to make a phone call! What do you think I'm going to do, pick up one of the New Jersey delegates to the I.B.M. convention? Jack walks back towards the phone. As he walks we see that the plane is filled with ugly, boring businessmen.Yoo-hoo, guys! I'm home! I've got presents for you... so where's that wonderful fantastic babe... He enters and sees the state the apartment is in.... What the hell happened here? He walks into the apartment, shocked and overwhelmed.Peter! Michael! Are you here? He goes into the living room -- No one'sthere. Into Michael's room. No one's there. He goes into his own room, where the destruction is even moreshocking than elsewhere since nothing has been touchedin there.Oh, my God! My beautiful room! My beautiful, beautiful room! Michael!... Peter -- where the hell are you, for Chrissakes? He runs like a madman into Peter's room and stops short on the threshold. Michael and Peter are each holding a handle of the basket as they rock it gently.What the hell is going on around here? What happened to this place? What happened to my room? Peter and Michael look him right in the eye, still rocking the basket.And anyway, what the hell are youOh, I get it. The 'silent' treatment! Okay, if you won't talk to me, you can talk to my lawyer! This is grounds for divorce! You're in big trouble, the both of you.I paid to have this place decorated, too, you know. I'm not going to let you get away with this. He leaves; a second later, he comes back.It's too late to try and talk me out of it. I'm history. I'm gone. I'm outa here. He leaves. A second later, he comes back.I'm giving you one more chance to...And that's another thing! I will not have a baby in this house! Babies are not part of our agreement!Hey, will you please stop talking like Mr. Rogers? It's getting on my nerves.What?What are you guys talking about? What narcs? What gang? And who's that fucking baby?What??It's ridiculous. I look ridiculous.He should try South America.Paul, hi, it's Jack! Hey, listen, I brought you back a little present from South America. Can I see you right away so I can give it to you? ... Yeah, the sooner the better! I can't wait to let you have it. How about 67th and East River? EXT. EAST RIVER - EVENING A broadly smiling Jack arrives at the riverside. Paul is sitting on a bench. When he sees Jack, he gets up and comes to greet him, smiling and extending his hand. Without warning, Jack suddenly jumps him and sends him with a forceful shove flying into the water. Paul lands on his back with a big splash, and comes back up to the surface totally dumbfounded. Jack leans over the water and yells at him, like a madman, still a bit drunk.That was for your 'little' package, and consider yourself lucky I didn't turn you in to the cops! And get one thing into your thick skull: I have never touched dope,Crawl.Listen, Sylvia, you've got to come back. I travel, I can't take care of her... Yeah, but you're her mother... I'm her father -- what makes you so sure I'm the father!? The dates coincide! Big deal! That doesn't prove a thing... But she's still your kid, so do me a favor, get your ass back here immediately and take her off our hands... 'Cause we've got a lot better things to do with our lives than wipe a baby's ass, okay? Sylvia?... Hello! Hello! Sylvia, goddam it!Shit! That bitch hung up on me! Women! I could kill them!I don't have the number. I got a message to her through her agency, they won't tell me where she is. I don't even know where she was calling from. And you better believe she's not goingWho was that?What? Jesus Christ, Michael, why didn't you let me talk to her!?You jerk! You should've said she was terrible, sick as hell! Practically on death's door! What a jerk, what a pain in the ass you can be sometimes...Mom? Hi, how are you?... Yes, I'm fine. Yes, I'm eating well. Mom, how would you feel if I told you you were a grandma?... SCREAMING coming over the phone.... Yeah... A little girl, Mary... SCREAMING coming over the phone.... I'd love you to see her. In fact, I was gonna bring her down tomorrow... today?... Great, I think there's a flight in three hours. I'll be at your place by two. See you real soon! He hangs up gleefully, rubbing his hands together.Okay...I'll tell her.Right. Full of shit.Bottle of water, white as snow...Really, by hand?Rinse three times.My mother lives alone.Okay.I gotta get going, I'll miss my plane...Hey, Mom!But, Mom, I missed the plane.Where are you going?But why didn't you say so on the phone?'Bye!Yeah... she's starving. I gotta heat this bottle up right away. They go into the kitchen together. Peter immediately gets busy; he heats the bottle up quickly while Jack soothes the hungry Mary by carrying her in his arms.Goddamn cruises...Sure she did, but she was just leaving for some stupid cruise around the world. The entire fucking world! With some bimbo boyfriend of her's... and a bunch of retired bozos. PETERWhat?Oh, yes, I was expecting you. Won't you come in... They disappear into the living room. Jack shuts the door behind him. Michael peeks into the hall, then goes and looks into the living room through the crack in the door. Peter, too, peeks in.She wants to see Mary.Well, she wants to see her anyway! He heads toward Peter's room.Nothing, nothing.Yeah, but the nanny, Mrs. Bretsaws, she wants to see her.Yeah, but she wants to see her.No, no, Peter, please, really, don't go, don't bother, I'll go explain it to her myself...Wanna bet she's out of here in ten minutes slamming the door behind her? They tiptoe over to the living room door and eavesdrop.What did I tell you? Ten minutes to the second!Okay, listen, you guys... I've tried everything and nothing's working: my mother's off on a cruise; Mrs. Razzolini won't speak to us ever since the whole business with the cops -- we don't want to involve any of our girlfriends; Sylvia's taking it easy in Europe and there's no way she's gonna come back now that Michael went and told her everything's just fine and dandy. Peter did a terrific job getting rid of Mrs. Bretsaws, and all that's left are the daycare centers, but Peter's positive they're a breeding pit for A.I.D.S. So you tell me: What are we suppose to do? You want me to split with the kid? Or dump her in an orphanage?What do you mean, organized?What? Never! I'd rather be a subway conductor.No! Never.Well, needless to say I refuse, too!Hey, horny yourself! I don't give a shit. I don't need you guys. I'll find some other way to do it. And I won't take the New York-Washington shuttle! He exits, furious.Oh, hi... Nah, nothing's wrong.I was asking to do the New York- Washington shuttle for a few months.As a matter of fact, he said 'yes.' Paul backs up against the wall, protecting his face with his arms. Jack leaves, disgusted. Paul watches him go, totally confused.Okay, I'm off. She's well fed and she's sleeping now. We hear MARY CRYING.Shit, she's crying. I'll go pick her up... Peter passes him in the corridor. He, too, is ready to go out to his office. PETERNo, she needs to burp -- I've gotta rock her for a little...Thanks for the advice -- now why don't you just shove it? I know you let her scream for hours but I can't.You'd resort to any theory to not take care of her. Just because you've read some books...It's not your shift, anyway. Piss off, will ya?Shit, she's crying...Nothing, nothing. I'll be right back. He gets up, slips on a bathrobe and goes out of the bedroom, carefully closing the door behind him. He goes into the living room, picks Mary up, and showers her with kisses. Mary stops crying immediately and lays her head on Jack's shoulder, sucking her thumb. Jack rocks her for a moment then puts her back to bed. Mary instantly starts crying again. Jack very quickly picks her up again and kisses her. Mary is delighted by his tenderness. Jack puts her back to bed again.It' beddy-bye time now, honey, beddy-bye, don't cry, sweetheart...Yeah, every time I try to put her back to bed...What should I do?Watch your mouth, will you? I'm in love with that young lady.Listen, at night I'm in charge. So get off my back, will you?Oh, Michael, go to hell! I'm sick and tired of your little 'Father Knows Best' number!I didn't ask you to get up, I know what I have to do.If I can't bring a girl back here anymore, just say so. And I'm gone. I'm outta here. With Mary.And again, and again, and again... Meanwhile, the Brunette has put her clothes back on and gathered up her belongings. Now she enters the kitchen.No! Wait, please don't go... it's all over now, I'm coming back to bed...I tried, but she doesn't want anything --Well, actually... uh, lately I've been to Washington a lot... and uh... I'll be right back. He gets up and goes out.I'm warning you, she'll scream...That's not fair -- let's take Mary out there...Ladies and gentlemen, I would like you to meet my daughter, Mary.Don't cry, Mary, don't cry...A few months...It's her teeth...Stop it, Peter. Give her to me, I'll put her to bed...Well, she's asleep at last! We sang in har... Hey, where is everybody?You mean they're all gone?Peter! Peter, goddamit, get out here! Peter comes back in with Jack.They're all gone!It's because of the kid. They can't stand kids.And did you hear Natalie: 'She's throwing a temper tantrum, just put her to bed.' What a pain-in- the-ass that broad is!I scared everyone aw... Just cut the crap, will you? My whole life is diapers, shuttles and bottles. I do the graveyard shift, I'm the one who never gets any sleep. I...She's been gone for six months and four days.Don't worry, she's gonna get it but good!Let's see, the five bottles, the little bottles for water, the strainer for her cereal... ... Do you have a blender?For bananas and carrots and stuff. It's time for her to start eating them...Here, could you give these to Michael so he can pack them with the clothes? He hands two bibs to Sylvia. Sylvia walks through the apartment, and stops in front of Michael's room, where she looks strangely at the changing table with its mattress, its pretty sheet, and the baby's toilet articles. Sylvia enters the living room. Michael has spread all of Mary's clothes, neatly folded and ironed on the couch. He is packing them in a big bag.You really screwed us over but good -- you know that...Really. Our lives have been out of control for the past six months.Don't cry, c'mon... you're taking her back now, it's great...D'you have enough money? Can you manage all right?Do you have a boyfriend?Okay, then... well, 'bye... The three men are lined up on the sidewalk. Mary stares at them, looking a little lost. They wave their hands and:Well, that's that!She'll figure it out by herself...Now it's back to the good life for us!Forget about the New York-Washington shuttle! I'm off to Caracas!Whadda you mean, what's the matter with me?Me? No. I'm fine.Sure I did, why?So it's the Rockettes, so what?Whaddaya mean, sitting there? I happen to be getting ready to fly this airplane.Hi?Wait... uh, no...Oh, yeah, the park... the diaper and all...Have you noticed? I'm pregnant.So, shall we go for a walk?Wouldn't you like to be pregnant?You see, if I was God, and I could create the world all over again, here's what I would do: I would create Adam from Eve's rib, not the other way around.At least that way things would have been clearer to begin with, y'see. They wouldn't have made us believe that somebody could come out of our rib, y'know? 'Cause nothing ever comes out of our rib, y'know? Ever. Only out of our prick, and even then ... Everything still has to be done after that.What we men know how to make is planes, buildings, cars, and all that stuff... It's useful, mindAnd you know what, it's not even like they wanted us to believe it -- it might have been us who wanted to believe it... But let's face it, nobody comes out of our rib...Still, that's hard to take, goddam it!The dope? It was in the diaper, why?But wait -- the baby's gone...Tomorrow, San Francisco!I'll be back the day after tomorrow.Whaddya mean, now?Before what?It doesn't knock me out at all...No, she's from Finland. Oh damn it. What the hell's her name? They've got such weird names... Magdalena... no, Marianna... no ... oh, I can't remember -- anyway it's Ma-something or other...Hi. Is Sylvia in?Oh.Sure... Why not?Sylvia doing okay?Oh, I see... Silence. The Young Man sits down at the table and immerses himself in his books. Mary doesn't look up from her pack of cigarettes anymore.Listen, on second thought, I don't think I'll wait for her. Just give her this when she gets back, okay? And this is for the baby. Jack hands the bouquet and the rabbit to the Young Man, who plops them down on a chair.Shouldn't the baby be in bed by now?Don't you have any tights to put on her legs?No.No, I'm not going anywhere anymore, I've had it with traveling. I quit.Don't you call anybody.I'll be a dishwasher, I'll live in a flophouse.I'm not going, I told you; I'm not going ever again. I'm sick and tired of traveling, sick and tired of broads. They all have the same asses and I can't seem to love them anyway. I can't take another hotel room, and swimming pools and trendy restaurants! I want to knowHe's been here all day.He's in his room.Yeah...Yeah...Yeah, of course, 'cause after the 5:30 bottle it starts all over again around nine...And then that's it -- you get only an hour of sleep.Plus they don't put the kids to bed, they let them lie around half-naked...I could have strangled that guy...Of course. Leave her with us. Come back whenever you want. Get some rest. Sylvia, between two sobs, picks up a big bag beside her on the doorstep.I'll go heat up some water right away. Would you like a cup of coffee?She'll need two or three months to recover, at least... Maybe more!Then we could have four shifts instead of three!But we'd make a rule, she'd just be 'one of the guys!'", "clean_line": "oh god believe eyes look women look gorgeous calves telling athlete

They had comic strips on their walls, for God's sake.Oh yeah, who?Wait one second for me, I'll be right back. Michael walks off in the direction of Rosalie. Paul is wandering among the guests, trying to find Jack, he sees PETER who is talking with another young woman, NICOLE. Peter is nodding, idly looking around, com- pletely uninterested in the conversation.All's fair, old buddy... Jack watches a moment, then breaks into a wide smile.So you struck out again with Natalie, huh? That Carl is a real smooth operator.Well, I didn't do so well either -- I blew it with Rosalie. I don't even know how...That beauty I managed to swipeHow could you know that?That's not true. It's just that Sophia drives me crazy. She knows all the right buttons to push to make me mad.Terrific... time. He, too, leaves the living room and runs into Jack, who has his arm around Clementine's waist as he heads toward his bedroom with her.No, he's cuddling up with a blonde named Clementine...No, it is Clementine, the one with the tits this big...Yeah, but he was with Christie at the beginning of the evening -- after that he was with Rosalie and then with Clementine. And since I stole Rosalie away from him... Are you following this?So, who is it anyway -- Christie or Clementine?Well, things were going great until...How did you know?Well, I don't give a damn anyway, I have 24 drawings to hand in to my editor three days from now and I gotta work all night anyway... So it was all for the best. But you better not leave that Maxine's phone number lying around because when I'm done...What time is it?A.M. or P.M.?Up 'n' at 'em yourself, asshole -- I just went to bed. PETERNah, I didn't get anywhere.Six, six! He buries his head under the pillow.What?What is it?It's a basket with a baby in it.What are we going to do with it?But it says she went to Europe.Whose phone number?Why the hell would I have her number? I've never even heard of this chick!No way. If I had to keep track of all Jack's girlfriends, I'd have to be a full-time secretary.Hey, look, she's waking up... Hey, look, she's crying...Maybe she's hungry?Feed her, I guess...Soft stuff... I guess.Really? Jack said that?Oh, so he told you about this?Boy, he's got a helluva nerve!Let's call Jack's mother!Well, just to ask her advice...But this is an emergency!Maybe I should call my mother...Where are you going?!What am I supposed to do while you're gone?Whaddya mean, pick her up? I've never held a baby -- I'll drop her!Okay, okay, don't cry like that... I'll hold you, I'll hold you. He tries rather unsuccessfully to wrap the towel around the child. Obviously Michael is very put off by the smell coming from Mary.Rock-a-bye baby on the tree top...Stop crying now; c'mon, stop... quit it, will you?... When the wind blows, the cradle will rock... What is that jerk doing? Milking the cows or something?... When the bough breaks the cradle will fall... MARY only SCREAMS LOUDER.Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb, if that jerk isn't back in three seconds I swear I'll throw her down the garbage chute... Mary had a little lamb, little lamb... The DOORBELL RINGS.Well, it's about goddamn time! He hurries towards the door, grabs the knob and throws it open.Where the hell have you been? He stops. Before him stands the apartment MANAGER, Mrs. Razzolini, a squat little woman with a moustache.Oh -- Hi, Mrs. Razzolini!No, it's not me, I mean she's not mine...No, no, it's Jack's, I mean it's not Jack's, it's... someone loaned it to us, I mean someone...Mary.Yeah, well, I have to put her to bed now.She's... she's not here. She'll be back soon. Michael starts to close the door. She pushes it back open and holds out the package.Well, like, y'see... she doesn't like to be held by strangers... The apartment Manager has already given Michael the package and grabbed Mary. She covers her with kisses. Mary smiles. Michael absent-mindedly looks at the package.Oh no, don't worry, I'm used to it. Well, so long, Mrs. Razzolini.What a leech! And that other idiot isn't back yet! He throws the package onto an armchair in the hall.So you love to be held by strangers, do you?What the hell were you doing? You've been gone for hours! This damn kid's been crying the whole time. I've got a lot better things to do with my time! You're a real pain in the ass!Well, what the hell took you so long? What'd you do, go out for breakfast or something? I didn't even have time for a cup of coffee, for chrissakes.Okay, well, here -- take the kid, I've got work to do.'Cause, it's your problem. You found this kid.Jesus, there she goes again! We gotta feed her something.Why?Do you look on top or bottom?Try feeling with your finger. Peter slides his finger over Mary's gums.She's soaking wet -- did you buy any diapers?Excuse me, miss, could you tell me which diapers are the most absorbent?Yeah, but which are better: 20-35 pounds or 12-24 pounds?Oh right, how much she weighs...I have no idea what you're talking about! He's no friend of mine. Michael takes off very, very quickly.I can't hold her. This kid's out of control here!Then get the cotton yourself if you don't want me to let go of her! Peter grabs a huge wad of cotton.But the couch'll get dirty!How 'bout after-shave?Okay, let's just put the diaperHow am I supposed to know...? Peter tries to slide the diaper under Mary's backside but she squirms and kicks it off with her feet.I don't think they're too big -- They're ultra-absorbent. That's all. The more absorbent the better. Peter has more or less managed to adjust the diaper.My arms are getting tired.It's not working... What about laying her down?Well, whaddya expect, if you pull on it like an ape, it's gonna rip!Or maybe she's hungry again.Make it snappy, will ya, she's famished.Oh no you're not, you're not gonna leave me alone with her.You rotten bastard -- do you see me going out on any dates?So what! If you leave me alone with this kid, I swear I'll pack up and be outta here by morning.I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Oxman, but I've run into a few problems, I won't be able to bring you the drawings tomorrow morning as IOn second thought, Mr. Oxman... uh, better make that the end of next week. Please don't get upset, Mr. Oxman. I'll do everything possible to get them to you sooner... You have my word... I apologize again, Mr. Oxman... Thank you again, Mr. Oxman. Goodb... ... Mr. Oxman? Hello, Mr. Oxman?He didn't say what time?Terrific! -- We could rot here till eight o'clock tonight.Jack really could have called. He has to have gotten our message by now.Damn right! It's almost time for her bottle, you know.Yes, he does. PUNK #1 We came for the package.She could have at least given us a phone number or the name of someone to contact... PUNK #1 I don't get it. Didn't they tell you we were gonna be here today?Sure they told us! So what? That doesn't make the last four days any less hellish than they were!About an hour after her bottle, she starts yawning. Put her to bed right away or it's pure hell for the next three hours, at least that's what we've noticed. Peter has returned with the basket. The Punks look at the baby, their eyes wide with disbelief. PUNK #1 What the hell is that? A baby?You take it all, man! It's a package deal! PUNK #1 But what are we s'posed to do with it?How do I know? You take it where they told you to take it. PUNK #1 Y'mean, I take it to the connection?Yeah, whatever you want to call it. PUNK #1 Are you sure that's the plan?You bet that's the plan! We're not keeping her one more second. PUNK #1 Okay, if that's the plan... He passes the basket to Punk #2 PUNK #1 ... Here, hold this. Okay, so long! They start to leave, pressing the elevator button.You said it! Now maybe I can get some work done. He disappears in the direction of his room. Peter is sitting on something hard. He pulls it out from under him, it's a package. He looks at it, casually reading: \"Care of Jack Collins.\" He tosses it to the side. Suddenly, it dawns on him. He leaps up, grabs the package and runs into Michael's room.Well, a package, I guess.Yeah, why? Peter raises his voice, exasperated by Michael's calm attitude.Will you quit shouting!I don't know... Oh yeah, Sunday -- Mrs. Razzolini brought it up...What's the matter?Hey, asshole yourself!... Oh shit! Peter nods and begins to bark orders.Hey, what's happening? What were those cops doing... Peter shuts him up, grabs him roughly under the arm and leads him into his room, closing the door behind them. Peter speaks softly but he's totally freaking out, he can hardly breathe.Yeah? What?Tell me what...But did the cops see the dope?Shit!Don't worry. He starts down the fire escape, then stops and turns back.Oh, by the way, I put some water up to boil for her bottle. Michael disappears. Peter picks up Mary, grabs his wal- let and leaves the room. When he gets to the hall, he discovers that Cop #1 has joined Cop #2, to whom he is whispering something. Peter holds his license out for them to see.Hello, Officers... What's going on?Did you give her the 5:30 bottle?Did you change her?Okay, I'll do it. Michael puts down his bag of groceries, takes Mary from Peter and disappears with the box of diapers. In his room, he lays Mary down on his bed and starts undressing her.Okey-dokey, honeybunch, it's time to go beddy-bye now... We're gonna take a nice long nappy-wappy... He goes back to the living room, followed by Agent #3.So! Can I get you something to drink? Agent #1 totally ignores him. AGENT #1 So, who's the baby belong to?Yeah, Peter and I just love kids! AGENT #1 Now that's interesting. Well, we'll be seeing each other again soon, in fact very soon. In theCome back anytime, gentlemen. You're always welcome here. We have no particular plans to leave New York in the near future, so don't worry about us now. 'Bye now. Once the cops are gone, Michael races back to the living room. Peter has collapsed into his armchair.It's cool, don't worry, I got it stashed.This way it's close at hand!Relax, will you.I diapered the dope on her right in front of the cop and he never noticed a thing!Wait a minute. You're not gonna stick me with this kid! Tell them you need a maternity leave, tell them anything, but we've got to go 50-50 on this!Yeah, but don't worry about it, I'll be back before it's time for her next bottle. She's asleep now.Well, call him back. Tell him you'll come later.You're crazy. Oxman is leaving in an hour. If I don't meet him before then, I blow my 15,000 dollar contract.Look, maybe we could pawn her off on Mrs. Razzolini, just for a couple of hours -- she's crazy about her!Wait -- I hear someone... I'll go see... Peter waits with the basket. Michael tiptoes to the corner of the corridor.Just as I thought -- the goddamn cops are grilling Mrs. Razzolini.Listen, she's just had her bottle. She's sleeping like a log. Let's just leave her in the apartment. What can possibly happen to her? She's as regular as clockwork. She won't wake up till 8:30 and we'll easily be back by then...Morning, officers. Can I help you? AGENT #1 Search warrant. MICHAELYou'll have to excuse the mess... We had a few friends over last night... AGENT #1 Oh, really? Well, if I were you I'd get myself some new friends! Peter comes in, in his bathrobe, furious.Oh, don't mention it! It was a pleasure having you here! I hope you'll find what you're looking for very soon! AGENT #1 So do we. Michael closes the door and races into the living room where he discovers Peter putting on his jacket.Did you hear that? He said there'd been a mistake and they weren't going to bother us anymore.You think so? Really?But he said the investigation was closed.There's one guy for sure! A redhead, kind of young, disguised sort of like a college student.I have the feeling they'll come to us.What do you guys want?And we want to give it to you. But the cops are tailing us nonstop. Matter of fact, there's one right behind us now...Hello? Who? Goddamn it, where are you?... ... It's Jack. He just landed in Newark. He came back early.Make it quick, the punks may be trying to call...Hello? Listen, tomorrow, Central Park at the fountain near the merry-go-round, five o'clock. Be there, but... They've hung up on the other end. Michael hangs up and sits down, drained.... That was it.You think the cops have our phone bugged?All right, Jack. Why don't we start at the very beginning. The very day you left for your vacation...Yeah, we take goddam care of it.Peter couldn't leave. Jerry almost jumped out the window. It's lucky they even made it to the finals!And diapers. Have you ever tried to do diapers?And the day they wrecked the apartment, Peter came home and couldn't find Mary. I've never seen him in tears like that bef...And it just so happens, we've got a lot better things to do with our lives than wipe a baby's ass, even if she's yours! Peter and Michael exit, slamming the door.What's going on?Sure. I gave it to them, just a moment ago.Is it against the law to give a box of candy to my friends? Peter and Jack take off their glasses.I think that guy needs a vacation.Why don't you call her back?Hello?... No, it's Michael... How are you?... Oh, she's doing just fine, she's in great shape. We're taking very good care of her, you have nothing to worry about. 'Bye. He hangs up.Sylvia -- She wanted to know how Mary was doing.She would have just hung up on you again. The important thing is she knows Mary's fine.What's with him? The kid's doing really great!You'll have four already made, this'll hold till Miami.Tell her to make sure Mary gets plenty of sleep.If her ass gets red, tell her not to listen to any pediatricians -- they're full of shit.Then she should give her a bottle of water instead of the regular bottle. Works like a charm: Her ass will be white as snow in three hours.Peter says her clothes should be washed by hand...And only in soap flakes without any artificial color or scent. And then rinsed three times in very hot water.To put her to sleep we sing in harmony -- it always works.Solo works just as well.Now, as for the nipples, you've got to be very, very, very careful.As soon as the hole gets too big she's gotta throw them out -- This is extra, extra, extra-specially important -- 'cause if the hole's too big, the milk comes out too fast and it's bad for her digest...I am!On his way to Miami.No, he took Mary to his mother's, she couldn't wait to see her. He's gonna try to unload her on her till Sylvia gets back. I made her four bott...Don't worry, I told him everything he had to know, and I made her four bott...Why?Are you pissed off 'cause she's gone?I made her four bott... PETERFour bottles for the goddam trip. There, I finally got it out.Must be some nanny he found through an agency. Peter shrugs and walks away. Jack comes out of the living room.She's asleep.Look, her mother'll be back in less than five months. Let's not waste a shitload of time looking for a solution for such a short time. Let's get organized.Come on, stop arguing, you two! Jack, you're going to have to ask to do the New York-Washington shu...That way, you can do the 6-10 A.M. shift. That amounts to two bottles and two diaper changes. You do the shopping when you get home in the evening and that's all. Peter, you'll take the 6-10 P.M. shift. That's two bottles and two diaper changes, her bath and her laundry. Since I work at home I'll take the longest shift from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. I'll take her to the park for an hour, but that's it. No shopping, no cooking, no cleaning.Well... I thought you might do it...Listen to me, you selfish bastards! My shift is eight hours in a row. No way I'm gonna do nights too. After 6 P.M. she can scream all she wants, I don't give a shit.Come on, guys, cool it! It's my shift now. I'll rock her for a few minutes... ... and then I'll put her right to bed. So off to work, both of you. He pushes them both out.Coochie, coochie, coo... woo, woo, woo... bippity, boppity boo... Peter comes rushing into the apartment and runs toward his room. He stops short in the corridor -- he hears Mary's laughter and Michael's coochie-coo's. Noiselessly he tiptoes over to the living room door and listens, troubled. Then he walks away and shouts, as though he were just coming out of his room.Yeah, okay. Silence.Yeah... They're both uneasy.Yeah, okay. Peter exits.Maybe she's thirsty?I've bought some stuff for her gums. He rubs some of the medication on Mary's gums.Will you quit fighting all the time? She just fell asleep, for Chrissake.Okay, that's it. Into the kitchen. He exits, furious. Peter and Jack follow after him. Fuming, they file one after the other down the corridor past the stunned Brunette in her T-shirt who was waitingI've had it with you assholes! I won't be the buffer between you two anymore...I'm not a punching bag! You assholes!One thing I know: I can't goddamn wait till Sylvia gets back!Did you give her something to drink?Well, it's... art. I'll be right back. He gets up and goes out. Jack watches him.Oh shit -- the guests...And the hell with it.Don't sit down -- it'll get worse. You have to walk around. Peter gets up and walks around. Jack and Michael, standing, watch him walk. MARY SCREAMS even LOUDER as Peter walks back and forth in the room with her. The guests watch in uncomfortable silence.No, it's only because she's teething, she's usually very sweet... The guests remain silent. CAROLINEWell... umm... How 'bout if I get the cake now, okay? He exits.Ta-da! Will you look at this? Is this a cake or what? Can someone make a little room on the table so I can... Are you guys leaving?Hey, where is everybody?Oh, never mind, don't worry... Good night... Jerry and his Wife exit. Michael is left standing there with his cake. Jack comes in, full of beans.Gone. Can you make a little room for me on the table to put the...Yeah, all of 'em, hey, can you make a little room for me to...Hey, could you make a little room for me on the table so I can...Oh, fuck it -- I'm sitting down. He sits down on a chair with the cake on his lap.And what about me? I'm a prisoner in this house all day long, forget about chasing ass, I haven't gotten laid in six months. When the hell is your friggin' Sylvia gonna come back?You better give your goddam Sylvia hell for this!Do you guys want some cake? Guys?Thanks... I put the woolen things on the bottom and the diapers and lighter things on top, because you'll need those first...You'll have to come back and get the crib later.Then where are you gonna put the tub?Yeah...Yeah, she'll manage...Sleeping late! Different women every night! I can't wait!And I've got six months' worth of sex to catch up on with Cathy, Nora, Frances, Susan, Barbra... They have entered the elevator. The doors close. They come out of the elevator, in front of their apartment....Christie, Paula, Sheila, Lisa, Kimberly, Rhonda, Rebecca, Louisa...Peter? Yeah? What? Yow-ee! Hooray! Terrific! That's fantastic! I'll call Jack -- We're gonna celebrate tonight! He hangs up. The Blonde is now awake.They won! They won!Peter. He won the competition!Say hello to the Pacific for me.Is there any jam left?Y'mean the Japanese one?Mary? A sudden, weighty silence ensues.You want me to call them?But you've got to let them know!C'mon, I'll call you a cab, you've still got time.But the plane's s'posed to take off in half an hour -- They won't have time to replace you. This is serious -- you'll lose your job and you won't be able to pay your share of the apartment anymore... you... Jack takes off his pilot's jacket and throws it aside.What the hell happened?Come on, I made us a good dinner. I bought some filet mignon and Haagen-Dazs butter pecan. When Peter comes back he'll cheer you up...He has? I didn't hear him...What? Michael heads towards Peter's room. Jack feebly gets up and follows him. Michael knocks on the door. No answer.Peter! Dinner's ready! Still no answer. Michael opens the door: Peter's lying face-down on his bed. He's holding the rubber giraffe and sobbing. Michael and Jack, dismayed, stare at him. Peter hides his face in his arm. Jack and Michael go to the kitchen and sit down to their steaks, totally depressed.Jack! Jack, c'mere for Chrissake!Yeah, tell me about it! Finding time to take her to the park every day is a real bitch!She pulled the same thing on us. We lost all our friends in one night -- on account of one tooth!But you're beautiful -- At your age all you need is a good night's sleep and you'll look like new.We're old pros -- it's not a big deal for us...I'll go make up her bed! He exits, and, once in the corridor, prances around, leaping and dancing... He gets to the living room and goes over to the crib: suddenly, he recoils and freezes, a fearful expression on his face. Then he turns and races back to the kitchen.Hey, you guys -- come and see, come and see!Come see, I said. Jack and Peter nervously follow Michael into the living room. They stop short in front of the crib: There is Sylvia, curled up in a fetal position, sucking her thumb and sleeping like an angel.The poor thing, she's really wiped out.A room for her and a room for Mary...Yeah, she probably wouldn't want to move here. She'd think we'd jump on her any chance we could...She'll never want to...", "clean_line": "goes prehistoric man comic strips walls god sake oh yeah wait second ll right michael walks direction

the rent... yeah, it's high but split between the three of us it isn't that bad, as long as we don't eat. Nicole laughs.Oh hi, Paul, how are you doing? Yeah, sure, I'll take you to Jack. Excuse me for a minute. They move away.You're a lifesaver, I've been trying to get away from that womanHe's around somewhere. Check under all the couches. Paul walks off in Jack's direction. We STAY WITH Peter, who reaches Natalie. She is talking with a very styl- ishly-dressed, tall, young man, CARL.Oh Natalie, I've been looking for you all night.Deep? Hell no, we were just talking shop.Who, me? Jack's the ladies' man, not me. You're the only lady I'm after.We've still got two weeks left before the semi-finals. We'll be ready.Oh really? You've seen it?Ours is incredible too.Natalie, why don't you stay for a nightcap?Good night, Carl... I'll call you Sunday, Natalie. She has already left. The door closes on the last of the departing guests.He's an asshole! 'I heard you're not ready yet.' 'We're gonna kick your ass.' Well, we may be behind schedule, but we're still going to beat that sonofabitch and maybe I haven't scored with Natalie yet, but neither has he. She's not an easy lay, that's what I like about her. You know what they say: it ain't over till it's over. Peter and Michael go into the living room. Peter is picking up glasses. Michael is emptying ashtrays into the wastebasket.Who's Rosalie?Your old friend Sophia appeared and got you involved in a thrilling conversation about modern art, and meanwhile Rosalie...Michael, all you want to do is steal Jack's girl friends. You don't give a shit about the women themselves...Anyway, it was a great party, everyone had a good time...Where's Jack? Did he leave?That's not Clementine. I saw him doing his famous routine with Christie...Christie's got tits that big, too...I'm not. Jack enters the kitchen in very high spirits, singing.Yeah, here, I just put it away.I thought you were leaving at dawn for South America?Yeah, but word around town is their project's a piece of shit!I'll go bribe the judges!Come on, Jerry... A SECRETARY enters.I'm not in.Hi... yeah... listen, make it quick, I'm in a meeting here... yeah, a package... okay... someone'll drop it off Sunday and pick it up Thursday... No problem ... yeah... we'll put it aside, okay... no, no, we won't tell anybody about it... Is that it?... Right, we won't tell anyone... Hey -- love 'n' kisses to the Brazilian girls, vaya con dios, old buddy. Peter hangs up, laughing. Jerry gives him a dirty look.What?I'm going out for bagels -- how many you want, three or four?Eleven-thirty.A.M. C'mon, up 'n' at 'em.Well then... nap time's over. Back to work. So how many bagels, three or four?You gotta be kidding! Abruptly he turns and races back to Michael's room.Michael! Michael!Get your ass out here and see what's on the doorstep. This has gotta be somebody's idea of a joke! They run to the front door.Look for yourself.No shit. 'Dearest Jack, here is the fruit of our love. Take good care of her. I have to go to Europe and Japan for six months, her name is Mary. Good luck, Love, Sylvia.'Give it back to her mother, that's what.Well, we'll see about that, d'you have her phone number?You mean you don't know who she is?Well, what are we gonna do?Oh no, this can't be happening! She's not gonna start to cry now?! MICHAELWhat's her problem?Well, what are we s'posed to do?Yeah, but what?Oh no, I swear to God this is unreal! Can you believe that bastard Jack?! 'A little package,' he tells me on the phone, 'just put it aside till Thursday.' Put it aside -- can you believe him!?Yeah and he also said 'don't tell anyone about it -- anyone at all.'Yeah, he told me a package would be coming today, but he didn't say it'd be this!Just listen to the racket she's making! What are we s'posed to do?She lives in Miami for Christsake. She can't stop the baby crying from Miami.No, he said not to tell anyone...No! No way! You know what a pain that woman is -- she'll be on the next plane here to move in with us...No, please -- leave the mothers out of this, okay?! It's only four days. We should be able to handle that, besides you know the rule around here: it's fine to have a woman over once in a while, but... Michael finishes the sentence in unison with him.And that includes mothers! Peter steps over the basket and heads towards the elevator.I'm going to the store to buy some baby food.Pick her up and hold her.So what's the best brand?Oh right, the pediatrician... But which one sells the most?Oh, so this is the best kind?Then it's the worst kind?Oh, okay, then I can take this kind.Oh. Is that good or bad?Well, why don't they all have iron in them?Oh, okay, well I'll take this kind then.Oh, I see, there's milk with no milk in it?So what's the stuff that no babies are allergic to?Oh, okay, I'll take the soy formula.Oh really? What's Advance?Uh... about this old.I haven't looked.No, actually they had to leave unexpectedly. They had to catch a plane... WOMAN #1 Is she teething?Teething? WOMAN #1 Does she drool? Does she cry all night long? Does she chew on her fists? Does she put everything into her mouth? She acts out her words.I know she can't talk. WOMAN #2I told you they had to leave unexpectedly. WOMAN #1 Or else you could weigh her; that would tell you how old she is.So what about me? What should I buy? WOMAN #2 Didn't they even tell you the pediatrician's name?No. They didn't. WOMAN #2 You sure have weird friends.You have no idea how weird. WOMAN #1 Or else her hair. Does she have lots of hair?Look, ladies, thanks for all the advice. But I think I'll just take one of each. To be on the safe side.What bottles? WOMAN #2 You know what? This must be a kidnapping.Hey, how dare you speak to me like that! You've never spoken to me like that before...Will you please cut it out for a second, huh? I didn't have any coffee either, it took me forever at the goddamn Safeway.Whaddaya mean, take the kid? I can't hold her and make her bottle at the same time. And why should I be the one to hold her?Hey, asshole, I'm the one who foundYeah, well you just don't feed a baby. First you gotta look and see if she has any teeth or not.To figure out how old she is so we know what to feed her, that's why. Peter attempts to look into Mary's mouth but she squirms.How do I know?I can't feel anything -- I'll give her the stuff for newborns and hope she's not allergic to it. Peter starts off toward the kitchen, Michael follows.And then we'll have to see if she's allergic to iron, to soy or to milk -- you can't imagine how much stuff they can be allergic to!Diapers? MICHAELOh shit, my slacks! Goddamn her, she took a crap!Hold her. Hold her, goddamn it!Just gimme the cotton. Michael lets go of Mary's feet and she sticks them back in the crap.Oh for chrissake, don't just let go of her!Take the towels off -- They're full of shit.Yeah, but she keeps getting it all over herself. Man, this shit is sticky!... We need cleaning fluid or something to get it off...Are you kidding?! Waste our Saint Laurent on babyshit?Right. Michael hands him a diaper. Peter tries to figure out how it goes on.These tape things -- do they go on the front or the back?Hold her under her arms -- I'm gonna try it this way. Michael holds Mary under her armpits. Peter tries to put the diaper on her. It's hard. What's more, it would seem that Michael didn't buy the right size -- The diaper comes all the way up to Mary's chin.What the hell kind of lousy stinking diapers did you get? They're way too big!How the hell do these tape things work? Hold her for chrissakes!There. I got it. He tapes the diaper closed.Damn it. I didn't make it tight enough.Go ahead... No, not on the towels, they're all covered with crap... Michael lays Mary down right on the couch. Peter vigor- ously undoes the tape, and the whole PLASTIC lining RIPS apart.... What the hell is this friggin' mess? Oh, man, this is unbelievable! To think, they bombard us day and night with their goddamn TV commercials! And will you look at this junk? This stuff is pure shit -- You tape it closed, it sags, you undo the tape: bingo -- the whole goddamn thing falls apart!Michael, will you give me a break, will you please? Peter takes the torn diaper off. MARY utters a TINY CRY and pees copiously all over the velvet couch.Oh shit! Now she's pissing. Look at the couch. The sneaky little bitch was just waiting for me to get the diaper off, then whammo... Mary gives them a big smile.I happen to like my furniture. I'm going out to get some real diapers. You can clean the couch up in the meantime. He exits, slamming the door.I need to reach Jack Collins, he's one of your pilots... No, I don't know exactly where he is, but he was supposed to be flying the Miami-Caracas-Rio route... The guy who proposed to you?... Oh, did he?... Well, congratulations. Please... listen to me... you must contact him and tell him he's got to call home immediately. Okay? It's an emergency, a family problem... No, don't worry, he's not married to someone else. It's another kind of familyMaybe she's allergic to something?Already?Oh shit, she's soaking wet again.I told you -- I have a date.Look, it's with Natalie -- I've been after her for months already.You're a real drag, y'know? Tonight was gonna be my big night! Now I bet it's gonna be Carl's big night.Hello, Natalie? It's Peter. Listen, I'm really screwed. Jerry just called and we've run into a snag with the blueprints for the competition, it's an emergency. I've gotta go over to the office right away, I think it's gonna be an all-nighter... Of course I didn't know about this yesterday -- he just called me. Mary reaches out and begins to jab the buttons on the phone. Peter pulls her back.Hello? Hello?... No, I'm not trying to hang up on you. We're having some problems with the phone, that's all... No, Natalie, there's no one else here! You're the only woman I... I swear I'm not lying to you... What? You're going to call Carl? Okay, go ahead, call him if you want. I don't give a shit... Of course I'm not jealous. What makes you think I'm jealous?Jerry, hi, it's Peter. Listen, I've run into some problems, I can't make it today... ... Hey, take it easy, will you... I'm sick. Seriously ill. I'm burning up... The doctor had to come, I've gotta stay in bed till Friday. Hey, hey, hey, I'll work round the clock all weekend long... I swear, Jerry, I am not lying to you...All he said was Thursday.Well, I'm prepared to rot here till midnight if I have to, as long as we get rid of her.Well, when he does call, I'm gonna let him have it! That sonofabitch is on the beaches of Brazil proposing to the whole goddamn world. And we're here living in hell! He's gonna get his ass on the next plane back here. Vacation's over, Jack-baby, you better believe it.Oh hell!Package? Oh that's cute, referring to her as a package! Anyway, you can tell Sylvia she's a lousy stinking bitch. PUNK #1 Sylvia?Yeah, Sylvia! You can tell her she's got a hell of a nerve dumping her problems into our laps! PUNK #1 Problems? Did you guys have trouble?Do you have any idea what it's been like around here for the past four days?Well, anyway, they're here now, that's all that matters! Peter turns and walks toward the basket.The next bottle's in 45 minutes. I made it already. It's in the basket. PUNK #1 Bottle? Whadda ya mean, bottle?No, it's a very short teenager. Of course it's a baby! Now listen carefully: I'm giving you a can of the milk she's been getting. She loves it, and more importantly,Yeah, right... real clever... Okay, here. She's all yours. Good luck.Take what out? I'm not taking anything out. PUNK #1 Wait a minute, I don't get it! We take the basket and the milk, that's all. We ain't gonna take the... what's inside.Whadda ya mean, what's inside?Uh... listen... maybe you could leave us the address or the phone number just in case. So we can find out how she's doing? The Punks exchange a puzzled glance. PUNK #1 Oh, yeah, sure, the address. Oh shit, I don't have it on me... But I'll call you. Okay, so long! PETER & MICHAEL So long! The elevator has arrived. The Punks quickly slip inside it with the basket. Michael closes the door. Peter plops down in the armchair by the front door.Aah, relief at last! Good riddance!What the hell is this?Was this package delivered to you?When the hell did this package arrive?When did this fucking package fucking arrive, Michael?Holy shit!This is the package those guys came for, not the baby, you asshole.Look out the window and see if you see them, I'm gonna try toGoddamit! He opens the door leading to the stairs and races down them, holding on to the bannister. He flies, overwhelmed by anxiety. Suddenly he trips, loses his balance and makes a spectacular crash landing. The package gets a bit crushed, and little individual packets of white powder spill out of it. Peter stares at them in horror.What the hell is this? He picks up a few packets and examines them.Oh, God, no... dope! That's all we need! He starts to tremble with fear. He picks the packets up as fast as he can and hastily puts them back into what's left of the package; then shoves it all into his pocket and continues racing down the stairs.Oh, thank God, you're still here! There's been a terrible mistake. That wasn't the package you were s'posed to take. It was another one. I have it right here. PUNK #1 What do you mean? What other package?I'll take the basket back and give you the other package, here. No mistake. Peter takes the package from his pocket and is about to grab the basket. Punk #1 pushes him back violently. PUNK #1 You ain't takin' nothin' back, man.But I'm tellin you it was a mistake... PUNK #1 You tryin' to double-cross us or something? Beat it before I get pissed, man.But I'm telling you, I've got your package right here. There's been a mistake...But I'm telling you, I've got the real package in my pocket. PUNK #2 Watch it, the cops! Peter quickly puts back the package in his pocket. A patrol car comes up next to them, right beside the car in which Graton is sitting, taking in every bit of the action.No, really, Officer, they weren't gonna drive off with it -- They were just watching it for me while I was doing a quick errand. Thanks, guys. Punk #1 gives him a dirty look. COP #1 All right, let's see some identification, everybody. The punks exchange a glance. Suddenly Punk #1 shouts: PUNK #1 Go! They take off running in different directions. Cop #1 charges after Punk #1 and yells to his partner who's still in the car: COP #1 Watch the guy with the basket! Cop #2 leaps out of the car, gun in hand. Peter stiffens with fear. COP #2 Freeze! All right, asshole, let's see some I.D.Listen, Officer, let's stay calm now. I haven't the slightest intention of running. I am not a criminal. I'm an architect. COP #2 (calming downI'm terribly sorry, Officer, but I don't have any identification on me. I just came down with my baby to run a quick errand. I haven't committed any crime. COP #2 All right, let's go, in the car. I'm taking you down to the station.Oh, c'mon, that's impossible -- you see I have a baby. I have to give her a bottle in fifteen minutes, I can't go anywhere. I live right in this building -- let me go up to my apartment and I'll get you my license immediately... You can even come with me if you like... COP #2 All right, lead the way. They disappear inside the building. Peter is carrying the basket in his left hand; his right hand is clenched on the horrible package hidden in his pocket. Just then Cop #1 comes running back, empty-handed. Graton gets out of his car and comes up to Cop #1, show- ing him his badge.This is it. Please come in... can I get you a cup of coffee or something? COP #2 No thanks. I'll just wait out here. Peter enters the apartment and calmly crosses through the house, carrying the basket. As soon as he's out of the cop's sight, he starts running like a madman down the corridor. He runs into Michael who was just coming to meet him.Michael... Michael... we're in deep trouble. The package... The package...There's a cop on the doorstep... He didn't see you... He mustn't see you... We're in deep trouble, Michael...The package they came for wasn't the baby, it was dope, drugs, a shitload of dope! We were stopped by some cops down on the street.No, it's right here.We'll get twenty years if the cops find this on us! Climb down the fire escape and hide it... anywhere! Michael takes the package, opens the window and starts to climb out it when Peter stops him.Hey, whatever you do, don't lose the goddamn dope, we gotta be able to return it to those dealers or we're dead. Those guys are serious.Here's my license. COP #1 I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to remain in the apartment. The narcotics squad will be arriving any moment now. They want to ask you a few questions.Narcotics squad? What do they want with me? I don't even use aspirin!Don't worry, Michael, it's nothing serious, just a little misunderstanding.Yeah, I just gave it to her.No, she's soaking wet.He's my roommate. AGENT #1 Oh, I see, I see...No, you don't see. There are three of us sharing this place. AGENT #1 Oh, three, huh? A regular 'mirage a trois'!It's 'menage'... and it's not. We all have lots of girlfriends, thank you. AGENT #1 Uh-huh, so what's your friend do?He's a cartoonist. AGENT #1 What about the other guy?He's a pilot. AGENT #1 Ah-hah... Now that's interesting...No. Never. Only North America. The PHONE RINGS. AGENT #1 Would you object if I answered it for you?Not at all, go right ahead. I've got nothing to hide. Agent #1 picks up the phone and listens. AGENT #1 It's a collect call from a Jack Collins in La Paz, Bolivia. That wouldn't happen to be your pilot friend, would it? The one who never goes to South America?Yes, it is him. Agent #1 hands him the phone.Hello, yes, operator, I accept the charges. Agent #1 gestures to Agent #3 to take a look around the apartment. Agent #3 slips away. AGENT #1 Would you mind very much if I listened?Please, go right ahead. Agent #1 picks up the other telephone.Hello, Jack? Fine, yeah. How're you? Yeah, he's fine, too. Yeah, we left a message for you, right... No, it was nothingI said everything's fine! The what?... I don't know what you're talking about... Oh yeah, the package! Yeah, yeah, it got here ... and was picked up, uh-huh. Hey! Why didn't you call sooner? Huh? 'Cause what?... Oh, you're onto something hot -- well, aren't you the lucky one!... So when are you getting married?... Forget it, I was just kidding... Well, everything's fine up here. So have a good time. See you in a couple of weeks. 'Bye. Peter hangs up. So does Agent #1. AGENT #1 Now that's interesting. So you wanna tell me about this package and the hot something-or-other your friend lucked onto... in La Paz... Bolivia... South America? Peter sits down, stunned.Sure. This is Jack Collins. AGENT #1 Oh yeah? Now that's interesting. Michael has laid Mary down for a nap in her basket, observed by the five cops. He now sits down, cheerful and bubbling over with enthusiasm.It's Jack's daughter. AGENT #1 And why are you two taking care of her?Because her mother's in Europe for six months, and since Jack had to be away for two weeks, I took my vacation to take care of her, I love kids.Christ, what a mess! They'll be on our tails around the clock! How the hell are we gonna get rid of the goddamn dope?! By the way, where is it?Where? Michael points to Mary's bottom.Huh?Are you out of your mind??I told the cops we were taking care of her. You realize we're now stuck with the kid till JackAnd that's not all -- we haven't heard from the punks yet either!That's right, you heard right: I'm not coming in to work for two weeks... No, I can't explain why... ... Because I can't, that's all!... NO, this has nothing to do with chasing ass! Jerry... Jerry! Will you stop screaming for a minute and listen? I'm in trouble, you understand? Deep trouble... I know... I know...... Goddammit, Jerry, of course winning the competition is important to me! The firm's my whole life if you must know. No, no, please -- don't send anyone over here... Don't you come either. No, Jerry... Okay, listen, I'll be there in a half-hour, but I can't stay long. No! Don't come here! I'll be right over. He hangs up. Michael enters the room, with his coat on. MICHAELYou're going now?Terrific, just terrific! Jerry just called: I have to go to the office right now.There's no way. I can't, he's suicidal. Why don't you call Oxman and tell him you'll be there in a few hours.Oh shit, I can't take this anymore!Good idea! Let's go.Oh shit! We sure as hell can't hand her the baby with an ass full of dope... right in front of the narcs! The elevator has arrived meanwhile.What should we do? I really gotta go...Yeah, you're right, we won't be long. They rush into the elevator.Michael? Michael, are you here? No answer. Peter pushes the door open. The sight that greets his eyes is very dismaying. It looks like a tornado has hit the house. Everything's on the floor, it's all been smashed, it's all been ripped apart. Gone is the beauti- ful apartment that had been so lovingly decorated. In its place, utter devastation and shambles. Peter stands there speechless for a moment, then an awful thought crosses his mind. He runs like crazy into his room -- the basket's not there. Stepping over the debris and all the things strewn over the floor, he rushes into the living room, then into Michael's room. The basket's nowhere to be seen. Peter falls apart; without even realizing it, he's moan- ing and muttering distractedly. He runs into Jack's room, into the kitchen, into the bathroom. The basket is nowhere to be seen. Peter runs all over, back and forth ten times in all the rooms. Tears are flowing from his eyes. Suddenly, he hears FAINT CRIES. They're coming from the back bathroom. Peter rushes to it, practically ripping the door from its hinges. There on the toilet is the basket, and on it there's a note written in big messy printing which says: \"NEXT TIME WE TAKE HER.\" Mary looks at Peter and smiles; she seems in great shape. A distraught Peter picks her up, hugs her tightly and kisses her all over as he takes her into his room. Just then, Michael appears in the corridor, silent andWhat the hell are you guys looking for, anyway? AGENT #1 Probably the same things your friends were looking for last night! Didn't Mrs. Razzolini bring you a package last Sunday?You mean the chocolate Easter bunnies? We ate them already. He starts to walk away.Anyway, you have no idea how many packages we've been getting lately. It's hard to keep track of them. AGENT #1 Maybe we can help. Let's get to work! All the cops enter the apartment.My pleasure. Try not to make a mess.Be my guest.Bullshit, it's a trick.They just said that to put us off guard. They saw the condition this apartment's in.They know the punks were here looking for the dope and that they probably didn't find it. So that means we've still got it.Okay, let's just see how closed it is. I'll go downstairs. You watch out the window and see if I'm being tailed.So? Was I right?I knew it. They're going to be watching us around the clock.We'll have to be very careful.Gimme that. Jack? What the hell are you doing? Yeah... yeah... oh yeah? Well, listen very carefully, Jack. That wonderful, fantastic babe you brought back from Bolivia? The one you're gonna marry tomorrow? Well, you're not going to bring her here!... You are going to say 'goodbye' to her very nicely and put her in a cab back to Bolivia... Why? Because there's another wonderful, fantastic babe waiting for you right here at home ... Who is she? Oh, that's a surprise! You'll see when you get here. But believe me, she'sSo hurry home, Jack, this little doll can't wait to see you. 'Bye. He hangs up.That goddamn mother fuckin' jerk of an asshole! I swear when he comes through the door I'll kill him! I'll... The PHONE interrupts. Michael leaps up and answers it.All we can do now is hope our plan works.I don't think that's legal, is it?Would it be asking too much of you to shut your big mouth for a few seconds? There is a child here who's trying to sleep.Michael, please hold me back... or I'll kill him. Michael takes the basket handle from Peter's hand, places the basket carefully on the bed, and walks without a word towards Jack, who he takes by the arm and steers into the living room. Peter softly shuts the door behind them and follows.His nerves! Ha. Ha. Ha. His nerves! Michael, his nerves! You wanna talk about nerves! Then just shut up and listen. It so happens we don't want a kid here either, but when someone dumps one on us, we take goddamn care of it.We haven't had a decent night's sleep in two weeks. Michael's probably going to lose a $15,000 contract...First, we've got the narcs on our ass, then there's the drug gang threatening to carve us up. Then bottles... bottles... every three hours, bottles.'La Paz, Bolivia...' He calls from ... 'I'm onto something hot.' He says. 'Did the package get there?' He says. You asshole!Never mind about that. Look, Jack, you got us into this mess, and you're going to help us get out of it.For your information, the 'fucking' baby's name is Mary. And if I were you, I'd watch what I said about her... because she just so happens to be your daughter!You look completely ridiculous -- so what?What's the problem?Yeah, I hear it's nice there this time of year.Anyone home? Michael is in the living room, eating a sandwich, while looking through a magazine.How 'bout Jack?Oh, yeah. He's got a lot of nerve! Leaving us with the kid again...You're kidding! That son-of-a- bitch!Oh, I'm telling you, that guy is really starting to get on my nerves!Goddamn him! He really could have called me!Of course not! What, are you crazy? I'm relieved! Thank God she's out of here!You're bringing her back?So what happened? Did you two have a fight?Didn't she want to take her?Who is it?What do you want?Don't go into my room, she's asleep.No, damn it, no! You're gonna wake her up! It already took me an hour to sing her to sleep...All right, I'll go explain the situation.It's no bother, Jack. I'll be glad to do it. He rushes toward the living room.... A sleeping child should not be awakened. If you don't know that, then you're not fit to be a nanny.'Round-the-clock'? Whaddya mean 'round the clock'? Are you intending to sleep here?And where are you going to sleep?Well, I don't know where Jack intends to stick you... That's his problem... Maybe in his room... But I'm warning you, Mrs. Brestshow.There are three of us sharing this place and we're all real studs.Oh, yeah? How do you figure that?Well, listen, Mrs. Fretsaw, umm... Brainsore...Right... Bratsnot, lemme tell you something. With a child you always know who the mother is, but the father -- that's another kettle of fish. So don't give me that bullshit, okay?What for?What do you mean, make you a list? -- Don't you do the shopping yourself?We have plenty of everything.She only eats milk and cereal.Oh that's bullshit. You don't feed a baby like an adult.I've read plenty of books. The diet recommended by those quack pediatricians today is way too rich. I'm in favor of natural methods, Mrs. Breathmint.For instance, if a child is having trouble getting to sleep, what would you do?I knew you'd say something like that, you jerk!Do you know the song that goes 'Medicine's a whore and the pharmacist is her pimp'?Mrs. Breakballs, if you don't get out of here right this minute I'm gonna punch you in the nose! This is my home, now get out!Well, you'll have to ask to fly the New York-Washington shuttle for five months, on account of serious personal problems.Then dump her in an orphanage, 'cause there's no way we're gonna take care of her all by ourselves anymore!What if she gets up at night?Not a chance! I'm not doing the night shift. I absolutely refuse. I have too much work to catch up on for the competition.You know, Jack, you're a real slime ball! We give you the easiest shift: the morning. She's always in great shape in the morning, isn't she? We've got to work like crazy to save our jobs and you have the nerve to refuse nights. Goddamit, she's your daughter. Are you that horny?I'm telling you, the more you pick her up, the longer it'll take her to get to sleep.I never let her scream for hours!Can you believe what he just said to me... I read those books bec...Hi, Michael, I just came back to get a file I forgot...Everything okay?Well, I guess I'll be going now.The baby okay?She's crying.No, her back teeth must be starting to bother her...Try and put her back to bed; we'll sing. Jack puts Mary back to bed. Michael, as a routine, sings a major chord, giving each of them their notes. They start singing a lullabye in three-part harmony, as they lean over the crib. Mary is in seventh heaven. She looks up at them, she stops crying, she sucks her thumb.Who the hell's that broad?Can't she speak softly like everyone else?Yeah, you're right, I'm fed up with it, too!I don't mind getting up, that's not the point...You can bring whoever you want as long as they speak softly like everyone else!Yeah, you can say that again!No, I haven't had the time lately.Why do you always have to bring Carl along with you?Oh, c'mon -- I love him! Only, I'd like to see you alone for once, that's all.Well, we'll see about that. Jack returns to the table. Peter's eyes follow him nervously.Save room for dessert -- it's a three-tiered cake from Balducci's! EVERYONEUmm, it's made with whipped cream and loads of nipples on top -- I mean, loads of... raspberries ... I'll be right back...Try and put her back to bed...I'm sure she's cutting a tooth...You two go... I'm staying with her. It can't be worse than listening to Carl.Your daughter... your daughter...There's too much noise. He shuts the MUSIC OFF. MARY keeps on SCREAMING.She's teething, that's why she's cranky. Give her to me, I'll try and calm her down. Peter takes MARY on his lap. The SCREAMING CONTINUES.She's in Europe, she'll be back in a few days.We already tried...What?What?What?Well, she's not the only one with a limited conversation. At least she has an excuse, she's a baby! What's yours?I mean, I've been listening to your pompous drivel about the latest trends for the last two hours, and frankly, it's a crock of horseshit.You motherfucker, get out of here! Get out of my house right now or I'll kick the shit outNo, I'll go. And you can all go fuck yourselves! Go back to your asinine conversations! He exits with Mary. Jack, embarrassed, follows him.Who gives a shit, they're all jerks anyway.I can't stand kids either but that's not a reason to leave! Dipshits, they're all a bunch of dipshits, every one of 'em.Hey, you're the pain-in-the-ass! First you dump a baby on us, then you scare everyone away from the party, then...Listen, we all have two full-time jobs! That's for sure!If she's not back by the end of next week, I'm kicking her kid out!And you can tell her we have a lot better things to do with our lives than wipe a baby's ass, goddamn it! He exits. So does Jack. Michael is buried under the three-tiered cake, unable to see around it.Oh, it's you... Wait, I'll goFine, fine, she's doing great... She's getting her back teeth in lately, it's been a bit rough...Oh, yeah, sure, she's in there... They both enter the living room. Mary stares at Sylvia. When she spots Mary, Sylvia suddenly breaks down in tears. Peter is dumbfounded.Oh, yeah... make life difficult for Jack...What?Oh, yeah, yeah, I'll go get him... He exits like a sleepwalker and goes straight into Michael's room. The latter is asleep.Michael, Michael... Sylvia's here. Michael wakes up and looks at Peter.Mary's leaving.No, I have to burp her first. With dexterity, he places Mary face down on his shoulder and walks around in the kitchen, patting her on the back.Give me the playpen first...Just give me the playpen.No, no thanks... I'd rather do it myself... Jack is standing beside the back door of the cab, leaning over toward Sylvia, who is holding Mary.
