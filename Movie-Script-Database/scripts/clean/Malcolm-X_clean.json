What happens if you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft.What? Everybody knows God is White.What for?What the hell for, man?Okay, okay. Show me, man.I can't make out that shit.Hey, they's some shit, all right.That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?Then what you telling me to study in them for?Man, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking at?Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.Where am I gonna start?Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant-eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.I'm staying.Take 'em. I don't smoke no more.Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.This a helluva game. Somethin's going on.What?How bout that?A black man playing big league ball is something.Little.I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.Then the devil is white.I sure met some.I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.I will do it.I can't.I want to, Bembry, but I can't.I can't.I want to, Bembry, but I can't.I don't know what to say to Allah.Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.I don't know how.I want to. God knows I want to.Allah Akbar: all praise to Him who is all-seeing, all-understanding.Yes it is, Chaplain Gill. But I wouldn't want to say which one of us is what.You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?They were Hebrew, weren't they?As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.What color were the original Hebrews?Then we don't know that God was white.But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.How many you turning out?Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.We can always use another good brother.You think you are Christians, and yet you see your so-called white Christian brother hanging black Christians on trees. You say that white man loves you and yet he has done every evil act against you. He has everything while he is living and tells you to be a good slave and when you die you will have more than he has in Beulah's land. We so-called Negroes are in pitiful shape. Get off your knees praying to a picture of a white, pale blond, and blue-eyed Jesus. Come out of the sky. Build heaven on earth. Islam is the black man's true religion.And that the white man is the devil. Yes, God is black and you are made in His image and don't know it. That's how brainwashed you are.Come to our Temple and hear the truth. Because, brother and sister, you are dead. Yes you are, mentally dead, spiritually dead, morally dead. And we are here to resurrect the black man back from the dead.We're not American, we're Africans who happen to be in America. We were kidnapped and brought here against our will from Africa. We didn't land on Plymouth Rock, brothers and sister. Plymouth Rock landed on us.Put an end to your begging. No more \"Please, Mr. White Man, Lawdy boss, brush me another crumb from off your table, kindly, sir.\" We are a nation, a great nation and don't need a thing from them.It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?Hello, Archie.Take it easy, baby.You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but--Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.You could of been something, Archie, but the devil got to you.--and what has the white devil made of them: dead souls. Oh, my he has no conscience. He should fall on his knees and say, \"My kind commits history's greatest crime against your kind every day of your life.\" But does he? No. He scorns you, splits your head with his nightstick and calls you nigger. If you've had it, then stand up and come forward. If not us, then who? If not now, then when?Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?What?Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?If you want to tell me.Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.What points?Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?Notice especially the claw, the jaw and the skull formation. This is the rat. This the mole. Here you have the aardvark and the boar...So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.Delicious.0h, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?Just an idle question.How old are you, Betty?Are you?What have you set your mind to?I'm from Muslim Temple 7.Where is he?I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out.Take a look out that window. I intend to see Brother Johnson.Brothers of Brother Johnson.Until I'm satisfied Brother Johnson is receiving proper medical attention, no one will move.Only a pig could do a thing like that.Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that.I'm not satisfied.They're all disciplined men. They're doing nothing except waiting.That's your headache, Captain. And if he dies, I pity you.Thank you, Doctor.You bastards.I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.That's enough, Brother Earl.Sit down, son.Do you know what it means to be a true Muslim?I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly.Let me do it then.Allah Akbar.I'm in Detroit.At a gas station. Will you marry me?Did you hear what I said?I think so. Can you catch a plane?I love you.It won't be easy.It will be rough.I'll be away a lot.What do you think?I must emphasize at the outstart, that the Honorable Elijah Muhammad is not a politician, so I'm not here this afternoon as a Republican, nor a Democrat, not as a Mason nor an Elk, not as a Christian nor a Jew, not as a Catholic nor a Protestant, not as a Baptist nor a Methodist, not even as an American. For if I was an American the problem that confronts our people today would not exist. So I stand here as what I was when I was born: A BLACK MAN!What kind of black people does the Honorable Elijah Muhammad speak for? Black people who are jobless... the black masses who are poor, hungry, and angry, the black masses who are dissatisfied with the slums and ghettos in which we have been forced to live... the black masses who are tired of listening to the promises of white politicians to correct the miserable living conditions that exist in our community... the black masses that are sick of the inhuman acts of bestial brutality practiced by these semi-savage white policemen that patrol our community, like the occupation forces of a conquering enemy army... the black masses who are fed up with the anemic, Uncle Tom leadership set up by the white man to act as a spokesman for our people and to KEEP US SATISFIED AND PACIFIED WITH NOTHING!If the black man cannot go back to his own people and his own land, Elijah Muhammad is asking that a part of the United States be separated and given to the Muslims so they can live separately.Yes sir. As you know, during slavery time, the slavemasters named most of the so-called Negroes in America after themselves. Mr. Elijah Muhammad teaches us once you come into the knowledge of Islam, you replace your slave name with an X. Since we've been disconnected, cut off from our Eastern culture for so long that we don't know the names we originally had, we will use X until we get back to the East.Please, go ahead.For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, \"Do you hate me!\" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.I'll talk about \"progress\" in a minute, but let me finish with my brother.You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: \"Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture.\" Would you agree?Well, I have this to say. Do you know what a Negro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is called -- by the white man? I'll tell you. He's called a nigger.Don't you want to hear about the Field Nigger?Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, \"Let's go, let's separate\", he'd yell, \"Yeah, man, any place is better than this.\" You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one.--there's another one. The majority of black Americans today are Field Negroes. They don't talk about OUR progress, about OUR government, OUR navy, OUR astronauts. Hell, they won't even let you near the plant.Brother Man, put that bottle down, take that poison away from your lips. That's what the devil wants you to do, stay high, out of your natural mind. I know, I've been there.It's time you received your X. But first you must copy this letter, exactly as I give it to you; down to the dotted \"i's,\" crossed \"t's,\" everything. And you must go on a fast, just water and juices, that's it.Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact.When you live in a poor neighborhood, you're living in an area where you have poor schools.You are now Benjamin 2X.Come, sit with us.We are now sitting with Brother Benjamin 2X.Let's get this man some food.Nothing!...My high school was the black ghetto of Roxbury. My college was the streets of Harlem, and I took my masters in prison. If you look out the window--Mr. Muhammad is trying to get us on God's side, so God will be on our side to help us fight our battles. When Negroes stop getting drunk, stop being addicted to drugs, stop fornicating and committing adultery. When we get off the welfare, then we'll be MEN. Earn what you need for your family, then your family respects you. They'll be proud to say \"That's my father.\" She's proud to say \"That's my husband...\" Father means you're taking care of those children. Just 'cause you made them that don't mean you're a father. Anybody can make a baby, but anybody can't take care of them. Anyone can go and get a woman but anybody can't take care of a woman. This is the type of teaching that the honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us so we can build the moral fiber of our people.I can see the gentlemen of the press, also the FBI and CIA. are with us. Get it straight 'cuz if I said, \"Mary had a little lamb,\" they'd write Malcolm X lampoons poor Mary.We have built temples in Boston, in Detroit, in Atlanta, Philadelphia, Washington -- 100 temples in fifty states. From a handful we have grown to scores of thousands.Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?Sure, man.What?Say what you're saying.Long day. Long night. Long year. Long ten years.How do you know?I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.I just want to sit here and be still.Talk about what?There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.Is that what this is about? Material wealth?The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.What do you want me to do? Our people need me.What do you want me to do?Sister Evelyn, believe in Allah.He told you that?Are you sure?Allah will provide.\"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle.\"We tell the world we're moral leaders because we follow the personal example of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. It's hard to make a rooster stop crowing once the sun has risen. The sun is up.And what do I say of this so-called national mourning! I say... the white man's acts are condemned, not only by our beliefs but by his own.Both his Bible and the Holy Koran say: \"As you sow, so shall you reap.\" Both say: \"Sow the wind, reap the whirl wind.\"Assassination might be too good a word, and might I add an Arabic word at that. This was a prime example of the devil's chickens coming home to roost. Being an old farm boy myself, chickens coming home to roost never did make me sad. It always made me glad.Yes, sir, I did.I agree with you, sir. I submit 100 percent.How long has this been going on?What mission?What does Sidney say?No. You'll be marked for death.I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.And don't come back.Because 1964 threatens to be a very explosive year on the racial front, and because I myself intend to be very active in every phase of the American Negro struggle for HUMAN RIGHTS, I have called this press conference, this morning in order to clarify my own position in the struggle -- especially in regards to politics and nonviolence. In the past I thought the thoughts, spoke the words of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, that day is over. From now on I speak my own words, and think my own thoughts. Internal differences within the Nation of Islam forced me out of it. I did not leave of my own free will. But now that it has happened, I intend to make the most of it. Now that I have more independence of action, I intend to use a more flexible approach toward working with others to get a solution to this problem. I do not pretend to be a divine man, but I do believe in divine guidance, divine power, and in the fulfillment of divine prophecy. I am not educated, nor am I an expert in any particular field, but I am sincere, and my sincerity is my credentials. I'm not out to fight other Negro leaders or organizations. We must find a common solution, to a common problem. I am going to organize and head a new mosque in New York City, known as the Muslim Mosque, Inc. This gives us a religious base, and the spiritual force necessary to rid our people of the vices that destroy the moral fiber of our community. Our political philosophy will be black nationalism. Our economic and social philosophy will be black nationalism. The Muslim Mosque, Inc. will remain wide open for ideas and financial aid from all quarters. Whites can help us, but they can't join us. There can be no black-white unity until there is first some black unity.Let's begin.As I recall, I pointed out that while I was in Mecca making the pilgrimage, I spoke about the brotherhood that existed at all levels among all people, all colors who had accepted the religion of Islam. I pointed out that what it had done, Islam, for those people despite their complexion differences, that it would probably do America well to study the religion of Islam and perhaps it could drive some of the racism from this society. Muslims look upon themselves as human beings, as part of the human family and therefore look upon all other segments of the human family as part of that same family. Today my friends are black, brown, red, yellow and white.Oh yes.Certainly, we will work with any groups, organizations or leaders in any way, as long as it's genuinely designed to get results.No, not particularly. But I do think that you will And black people in America, as they strive to throw off the shackles of mental colonialism, will also probably reflect an effort to throw off the shackles of cultural colonialism. And then they'll begin to reflect desires of their own with standards of their own.I don't see why that should be controversial. I think that if white people found themselves victim of the same kind of brutality that black people in this country face, and they saw that the government was either unwilling or unable to protect them, that the intelligence on the part of the whites would make them get some rifles and protect themselves.Has the white man changed since I went away? Have you put up your guns? The day you stop being violent against my people will be the day I tell folks to put away their guns.You have to sleep for three.I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.We had the best organization that black people ever had and niggers ruined it.Walk out the back, dear. Hurry.There's nothing to be afraid of. It might be a little cold. Hang on. We'll be fine.Call the Fire Department.And the fire hit the window and it woke up my second oldest baby, but the fire burned on the outside of the house. It could have fallen on six-, four-, or two-year-old girls. And I'm going to tell you, if it had done it, I'd've taken my rifle and gone after anybody in sight.It was bombed by the Black Muslim movement upon the orders of Elijah Muhammad.I can imagine. I did it myself. For the publicity.I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.Let sincere white individuals find other white people who feel as they do and teach non-violence to those whites who think and act so racist.Let's all pray without ceasing. May Allah bless you.Brother Earl.I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.I don't want folks to be searched, it makes people uncomfortable. If I can't be safe among my own kind, where can I be? Allah will protect me.Betty it's me. It's me.Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.At the Hilton. The girls asleep?I don't think that's such a good idea.Ma'am, I'm fine.May Allah bless you.Is the program ready?Why not? You've had ample time, you and the sister.Folks are sitting out there _today_, not next week, expecting to hear our program.Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show?So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.What did I tell you about assuming?Benjamin, you better go out there and explain why the program isn't ready today.Sister, please go with the brother.The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.Is my family here yet?You'll have to forgive me for raising my voice to you.I wonder if anybody understands.Make it plain.Brothers and Sisters, Wa-Salaam Alaikum.Hold it, brothers.

were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.I didn't know then that I was a nigger.They talked about me likeYou understand them words?White , adj. Of the color of pure snow; reflecting all the rays of the spectrum. The opposite of black, hence free from spot or blemish; innocent, pure, without evil intent, harmless. Honest, square-dealing, honorable.Dear Bembry. Please thank the Honorable Elijah Muhammad for the money and tell him I have not written him because I have not yet proven myself.But I have written everyone else.Tell the Messenger of Allah that I have dedicated my life to telling the white devil the truth to his face. I greet you with the ancient words: \"As Salaam Alikum.\"P.S. I finally worked my way through the \"Z's\"...God is black.Have you ever seen a black man who wasn't down on his knees begging the Lord to give him in heaven what the white devil enjoys right here on earth?My beautiful sister, for you are beautiful. Beautiful because you are black. Because black is beautiful. You work in the white folks' kitchen so I don't have to tell you that they're devils.How about Old Cadillac?You seen Sophia?Women who could be mothers, teachers, scientists......All members of the pig-rodent family.I demand to see Brother Johnson.Sister Betty?--you can see my burglary hangout. I lived like an animal. Had it not been for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad I would surely be in an insane asylum or dead.Okay, last hug.My darling Betty. Everywhere I go I am welcomed as the representative of our people.I wonder who he's working for? If I was a betting man, I'd say CIA. What's your guess?Today, with thousands of others, I proclaimed God's greatness in the Holy City of Mecca. Wearing the Ihram garb I made my seven circuits around the Kaaba; I drank from the well of Zem Zem; I prayed to Allah from Mt. Ararat where the Ark landed. It was the only time in my life that I stood before the Creator of all and felt like a complete human being.You may be shocked by these words, but I have eaten from the same plate, drunk from the same glass and prayed to the same God with fellow Muslims whose eyes were blue, whose hair was blond and whose skin was the whitest of whites. And we are brothers, truly; people of all colors and races believing in One God and one humanity. Once before, in prison, the truth came and blinded me. It has happened again...In the past, I have permitted myself to be used to make sweeping indictments of all white people, and these generalizations have caused injuries to some white folks who did not deserve them. Because of the spiritual rebirth which I was blessed to undergo as a result of my pilgrimage to the Holy City of Mecca, I no longer subscribe to sweeping indictments of one race. I intend to be careful not to sentence anyone who has not been proven guilty. I'm not a racist and do not subscribe to any of the tenets of racism. In all honesty and sincerity it can be stated that I wish nothing but freedom, justice and equality: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all people.My first concern, of course, is with the group to which I belong, the Afro-Americans, for we, more than any other, are deprived of these inalienable rights.I believe the true practice of Islam can remove the cancer of racism from the hearts and souls of white Americans.", "clean_line": "parceled went reform school lived woman house charge special colored kid class sort mascot like pink poodle know nigger talked likeyou understand words white adj color pure snow reflecting rays spectrum opposite black free spot blemish innocent pure evil intent harmless honest square dealing honorable dear bembry thank honorable elijah muhammad money tell written proven written tell messenger allah dedicated life telling white devil truth face greet ancient words salaam alikum finally worked way god black seen black man wasn knees begging lord heaven white devil enjoys right earth beautiful sister beautiful beautiful black black beautiful work white folks kitchen tell devils old cadillac seen sophia women mothers teachers scientists members pig rodent family demand brother johnson sister betty burglary hangout lived like animal honorable elijah muhammad surely insane asylum dead okay hug darling betty welcomed representative people wonder working betting man cia guess today thousands proclaimed god greatness holy city mecca wearing ihram garb seven circuits kaaba drank zem zem prayed allah mt ararat ark landed time life stood creator felt like complete human shocked words eaten plate drunk glass prayed god fellow muslims eyes blue hair blond skin whitest whites brothers truly people colors races believing god humanity prison truth came blinded happened past permitted sweeping indictments white people generalizations caused injuries white folks deserve spiritual rebirth blessed undergo result pilgrimage holy city mecca longer subscribe sweeping indictments race intend careful sentence proven guilty racist subscribe tenets racism honesty sincerity stated wish freedom justice equality life liberty pursuit happiness people concern course group belong afro americans deprived inalienable rights believe true practice islam remove cancer racism hearts souls white americans"}, "ARCHIE": {"raw_line": "Sit down.

Maybe you'll hear me then.Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.I thought you was smart. But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't white.The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault.

A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.Don't con me. Don't try...Don't con me.I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.Your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog.I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.Now look up \"white.\"They sure ain't no black man's books in here.You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.I'll pull your coat, daddy. Cause lots of these can't nobody read, be he black or white or a Ph.D. with their suspenders dragging the ground with degrees.Look 'em up and and out what they mean.Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here--Read it and keep on reading.If you take one step toward Allah, He will take two steps toward you.Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.I told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth. They let us sing and dance and smile -- and now they let one black man in the majors. That don't cancel out the greatest crime in history. When that blue-eyed devil locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off from our language, our religion, our history.No. That's the name of the slave-master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?Who are you?I told you we are a nation, the lost Tribe of Shabazz in the wilderness of North America.Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm--I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.No. Elijah Muhammad does not say \"that white man is a devil.\" He teaches us that the white man is the devil. All white men.Have you ever known a good white man in all your life? Think back, did you ever meet one who wasn't evil?The body is a holy repository.A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light.But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth----the hardest and the greatest.For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth----the hardest and the greatest.Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?Tell Him that.You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.In the name of Allah, the beneficent and the merciful to whom all praise is due.\"I wrote the Mayor, the Governor and the President, but for some reason I haven't heard from them\"...Why don't you try telling him that, Sister Betty?I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty.Your holy apostle, dear Messenger, I am your true servant and the brothers asked me to tell you Malcolm is getting too much press. The brothers think he thinks _he_ is the Nation of Islam, that he has aspirations to lead the Nation. It was you who made Malcolm the man he is. You lifted him out of the darkness.Great benefit for himself.What are you talking about -- \"blackout\"? Some of the Brothers are a little jealous. Maybe they think you been a little -- overpublicized. That's all. Forget it. It's nothing.You want a new car? You want a new house? Is that it? It's the money, right?We feel this is a publicity stunt on the part of Malcolm X.
