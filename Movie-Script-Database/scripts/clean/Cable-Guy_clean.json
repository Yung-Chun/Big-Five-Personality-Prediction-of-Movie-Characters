I can't believe she's doing this.All she had to do was say no. She didn't have to kick me out. I feel like Felix Unger.It's my first night here. Don't do this to me.Fine, fine.I couldn't. I'm not good at that stuff. What if he says no? I'll feel like an idiot.Where the hell is he?Forget it. Idiots.Don't leave! I'm here! I'm here!Hey, wait!You were supposed to be here four hours ago.Yes. I had to go to the Bed 'n Bath place, but now it's closed. CABLE GUYWhat happened?These go to your boss?What?I really don't want to talk about it with you. Could you please just install my cable? I'm going to get dressed.Okay, whatever.How's it going?What happened?So after this I'll only need one remote for everything?One thing.Uh yes.Forget it.Please that was dumb. I was just making conversation \u0096Oh, great. How much?That is so nice.Thanks. Really. You're gonna get some good marks here.Sure. We should do that one day.Tomorrow? Tomorrow's not good.No.You didn't cross the line.There are twenty-four classrooms; each can be converted into a 1400 square foot home. The facility has two tennis courts, an Olympic size pool and full gym, with a stage if the residents decide they want to perform \"Oklahoma.\"The kitsch appeal of living in an old schoolhouse should be very attractive to young, upwardly mobile home buyers. And most important, the structure is available in foreclosure. If we put down a cash bid, we're going to steal this thing.Absolutely. Now I've got more time than ever. It's a good thing. I know I can pull this thing off.Thank you. I will.I'll be right back.Hello.I was just in the area. Thought I'd pop by. How's work? How'd the big teen crush article come out?I know, it's just Daniels accepted my proposal to renovate the old schoolhouse.I know I'm breaking the rules, but come have dinner with me tonight to celebrate.Come on, this is the biggest day of my career.What position? I want to share this with you.Thanks.What the hell.How's it going?Where exactly are we goin?That's pretty impressive.I've watched a lot of TV in my life. I guess I've always taken it for granted.I know what you mean. My dad was there, but he might as well have been gone. My mom is a stewardess. She was always out of town.You know my brother's a speech therapist.Never mind.I miss her. I asked her to marry me, and she asked me to move out.She said she felt pressured. Can you believe that?You're right. That is remarkably insightful.Robin loves that movie.Maybe I will.Thanks a lot. I'm embarrassed to say this, but I don't know your name. What is it?I'll see ya' Chip.Uh good-bye.I don't listen to you. I pretend to understand but I'm really just saying what I think you want to hear. So from now on I'm going to try my best to listen more because I do love you and am interested in learning about every detail about the complicated splendor that is you.I want us to get back together, but I can see why taking this time might be good for us. So, I'm not mad.You're right. Well, that's what I came here to say. Look, I've got to get back to the office.I'm just going to cook myself dinner and watch a movie. \"Sleepless in Seattle\" is on cable.If you're around you should drop by and check out the new apartment.Here, here, here.Not your fault. I'm in the zone. There is no stopping me today.This is Chip Douglas my cable guy.Are you any good?What are you doing?Yeah. I'm fine.What are you doing?You ruined the game.What are you talking about? I don't even know you!No, I'm going home.Yeah, have a good one.Hey, good to see you.Come on in. What do you think of the place?That's actually where the movers put the furniture. I'm gonna change it, very soon.Work's good.Don't get me started. That guy has no vision. It's like working for Mr. MaGoo. He's just worthless.I know. Now if only someone at corporate smartened up enough to dump Hal, then I could really get some stuff done.Well, it's nice just to see you. Hey, it should be starting.Damn cable is out. Son of a bitch.No, no. We really should see it now. Now's a good time.Wait, wait. I know what to do.The Cable Guy's a friend of mine. I'll just page him. We'll have this fixed in no time.That was fast.Yeah my cable went out.I've been really busy. You've got to get my cable going, Robin is here. This is really important.I'm sorry. Please, you've got to help me.Anything you want. Name it \u0096 quickly.Fine, whatever you want.So what's with the cut cord?Nobody.Pretty well. We'll see. Look, about the other night. I didn't appreciate you --I really don't need to be surprised. Where are we going?Medieval Times?Funny. I never thought I would ever come here.Please don't.Good to know.Thanks for the help.Really? What does she look like?Are you serious?I've got to look.You got me.Could I get a knife and fork?There were no utensils, but there was Pepsi?Way to go Red Knight. Good job of killing. Good work.How do I put this? I've really enjoyed hanging out with you, but...Oh lord. I want you to know --What's going on?Is this a normal part of the show?Is this safe?What are we supposed to do? We've got to be careful we don't hurt each other.Just take it easy.What are you doing?!Hey, watch it!Chip, this isn't funny! Will you stop it!This isn't 'Star Trek!'Jesus.Don't do this!Oh my god.Are you okay?I've got to admit there's a real feeling of power holding that jousting stick.We should go again next week.What is this?You went in my house when I wasn't home?How much did this cost?Look, I can't accept this. I wouldn't feel right.And you've given me friendship, so we're even. Really, don't take it personally, but you've got to take it back.Sure, no problem. And don't get me wrong. I really appreciate the gesture.Oh, right.Good.Great.Hey, I had the best time the other night. When am I going to get you on my couch again?Chip?What do you mean?Hey Robin. What's up? Did you get my message?Sorry. I've been trying to reach you 'cause I'm having a party. You've got to come over.Dinner? What, like a date?You've got a date?! I thought things were going well between us.So why are you going out on a date?I'm not freaking out.I'm not. I just can't believe you would do this.Fine, enjoy yourself. Have fun.Fine. Bye.You're probably right.Oh, I got you a little something.So shoot me.My brother said it might help with your lisp.It's no big deal.You've got plenty of friends.You're playing with me again.Shut up.Who'd she come with?Hey. I'm Steven.Can I get you something to drink?Coming right up.Why? This is a great party. This girl is really into me.You don't even know him. You're just mad 'cause he kicked your ass in basketball.You sounded just like Olivia Newton John.So what do you do?Oh okay.She says she wants a break, and that's fine with me. I think I needed some time also.Where did Heather go?What a night. That was just what I needed.I feel like a new man. I was getting so used to being rejected. I really liked her.What do you mean it was \"your treat?\"Buy what?You mean Heather is a prostitute?I can't believe this.Get out of my house!Out, now! I don't ever want to see you again. Robin is never going to forgive me.I don't want your help. I want you to leave. And take that stuff out of here.Hello?Robin?Oh wellYou got it? Great.My friend?I'm glad you liked it. I've wanted to do something nice for you, but I've been trying to give you your space.Sure. I'll call you as son as I get home. Bye.The concert. Oh Jesus.Robin just called. I think we're getting back together.This is the first time she asked to get back together.Can't you get someone else to go?What?How do you know we're back together?I don't want you messing around with my life. You've caused enough trouble as it is.Look, I appreciate you helping me out with Robin. But you have to understand, I'm going to have to work extra hard to not screw this relationship up again. You're a great guy, but I just don't have any room in my life for a new friend. Do you understand?So, you're okay?All right well, take care.I'm fine.It can wait.Uh I'm Steven Bartowsky. What's going on?What? I never \u0096Hey, relax. I'm the one who's going to jail.I didn't do anything. My cable guy gave me all that stuff as a present.I swear it's true.I don't know. I shouldn't have.I'm fine! I didn't do anything! Please call my cable guy, his name is Ernie Douglas.That's got to be a mistake. Oh, this is not happening.Yeah, Dad, I did. It's all a big plan. When can you get me out of here?The entire weekend?What did you hear? What did you hear?Who are you?! What's your real name?!Why are you doing this to me?You set me up.I'll never be your friend. You need help.I will not touch it.What are you doing? Stop it.Stop it! Stop it!Get off there! Are you trying to get me killed?Guard! Guard!You go near her, I'll kill you.Hey, this is the guy who framed me!I'm sorry dad.I didn't do anything.Will you ever stop mentioning that?I'm fine.I just want to get this over with so I can go home and get some rest.Great. I feel. Bad. I've been kind of blowing Rick off lately.What is he doing here?When did you invite him?At lunch? You had lunch with him?Come here.Maybe it's because I just got out of prison, where you sent me. I should just drag you to the police right now.You son of a bitch.What are you doing?Very funny. Tony, go to your mother!I know you beat up Robin's date.You stay away from Robin.I really don't want to play this game. Woman. Woman.No.Can I pass?Breast. Breast.Center. Center.I can't say that to my mother!No, I've had enough. I can't do this. This guy is ruining my life, I won't sit here and play X-rated party games with him.I am not over-reacting. You're all being fooled by this guy! He's a felon for Christ sake! I hate you! Get out of my life!What? You have no idea what this guy is really like.See what I mean!You don't understand.Robin, this guy is a sociopath. He leaves messages on my machine night and day. He shows up wherever I go. He won't leave me alone.You know he was the one who beat up your date at that restaurant. That's right. And he gave you the free cable. It wasn't me.That's what he wanted. He was manipulating me. It feels so good to be honest about this. We're finally communicating. I've been wanting to tell you for so long, but he's been blackmailing me.With a photograph.Me with a... prostitute.He set it up. He invited this woman to my party and didn't tell me she was a prostitute. I'm so glad we can talk about this.When we weren't communicating. I invited you. You were out on a date.She seduced me. That's what they do. They're professionals. And I didn't even know she was a prostitute.That's not the point. The point is this guy has been setting me up. He's responsible.Robin you don't --Where did that come from?I'm sorry I've been blowing you off.It's just, this guy is really doing a number on me.You're the one who told me to offer him money so I could get free cable.Ernie Douglas.Did anyone notice I'm late?Thank you.Work's good.Don't get me started. That guy has no vision. It's like working for Mr. MaGoo. He's just worthless.I know. Now if only someone at corporate smartened up enough to dump Hal, then I could really get some stuff done.Chip! Chip, this isn't funny! Where are you?!!!Leave me alone! I have no job, no girlfriend, no family anymore! It's over! You won!Hello.Chip and Ernie Douglas.Carmine from \"Laverne and Shirley.\"So he doesn't even work for the Cable Company?Oh my god. She's right. I am a smotherer. I'm just like him.Hello.Rick told me you were fired from The Cable Company. You're not even a real cable guy.I swear to God, if you touch --Don't do this. There must be some way for us to work this out.Let's talk in person. Where are you?You stay away from her.I got the camera. You can't see me.Hey Rick. I need to meet with you right away. I've got some information about this crazy cable guy.That's great. Let's meet at the old school at nine-thirty.I think he's been following me. Don't be late, buddy.Be home! Be home!Hey Rick. I'm really excited to hear what you found out about this nut.No way.Hello.Rick.Rick Legatos. He's a friend of mine. Where is he?Can I see him?Hello.You're not going to get away with this.Was that Robin?Where's Robin?!Where's Robin?!!!Tell me!I got the point.Hang on.Stay away from her!I love you too. You're right. We shouldn't get married. I've got a lot of problems to work out which have absolutely nothing to do with you.Easy.Don't do anything stupid.No! This is not like anything! This is not a movie! We're real people! You're hurting us! This is reality!Nooo!You're not going anywhere.Don't do this. You just need help. We all get lonely.You're gonna be fine.

You agreed to this. I mean this is exactly why we broke up, because you never listen to me.I can't get into this now. If you haven't noticed, I'm at work.Steven. Congratulations. I know how much this means to you. You deserve it.Oh.Sometimes time apart is healthy.So, are you doing anything tomorrow?Really?Okay, maybe I will.You made some interesting choices laying out the room.No, I like it.So how's work?How's Hal?It's just great that you're getting to do it. It's a real step up.It's nice to see you doing so well.It's alright. We can watch it another night.Who was that?Yes. You left me five messages. It king of freaked me out.I can't. I'm going to dinner with someone.Not really a date.They are.I made it before we got together the other night. I knew you would freak out.Yes, you are freaking out.I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm allowed to date. It's not like we're back together. We had a good time the other night, and you're already pressuring me.I will.BlockSki? That sounds right.Well, not really.

What's up?What is it?No, things are actually going really well.Should I be worried?I will. Good-bye.Steven Bartowsky please.Hello.Me too. Believe me.Well, you were right. Something's happening with him and he won't even acknowledge it.You know his lawyer said that nobody named Ernie Douglas works for the Cable Company.And he's saying he received all the stereo equipment from you.I just feel like I triggered this with him. It's not that I don't want to get married, it's just I felt like he wanted to get married just to get married.

Cable Guy!Well, look who decided to show up. I was just gonna go collect my retirement pension.Was I? So I'm the tardy one. Good to know.They had a lot of cats.Hey, this could be a cool pad. Here is a comment card.Please mail it in when I am done.No, they go to me. I'm a perfectioniss perfectioniss perfectioniss t. Now let's take a look at what we're dealing with.Come on baby. Come on baby. Talk to me baby. Tell me where you like it. That's it baby.Here's your sweet spot.So your lady kicked you out.In preparing your service I noticed you were previously wired across town at 1268 and a half Chestnut. Last week the billing was transferred to one Robin Harris. Smells like heartbreak to me.No sweat.Hey, I'm going to go to the hallway so I can access the floorboards. Don't be spooked if you hear someone crawling underneath you.Put on your bathing suit 'cause you'll be channel surfing in no time.Guilty, guilty, guilt-freakin-tee. I hope they fry this bastard.The arrangement of your major appliances and your furniture was causing some noisy pics and hum bars in your reception. I moved a few things. Cleared it right up. Is that cool?You programmed? Then let me slave your remotes.Ooh, maybe we should leave these two alone.You know you're pretty good at this. You could be a cable guy yourself. Now let me check your levels.All right. That about does it. I just have some paperwork for you to fill out. Sign here.That gave me power of attorney over you. Joking.I'm about finished here. Okay. I feel good about this.Yeah!You mean illegal cable?Who told you that? I want his name.You're offering me a bribe? What you have just done is illegal, and in this state if convicted, you could be fined five-thousand dollars or spend six months in a correctional facility.I'm just jerking your chain. Wake up little snoozy. I'll juice you up. All it is is a push of a button.Don't worry about it. I couldn't charge you. Your girl just booted you. Consider it one guy doing another guy a solid.Hey, you're a 'nice' guy. You'd be surprised how many customers treat you like shit, like I'm a god damn plumber or something. Here is my personal beeper number. It's just for my preferred customers. Never call the company, they'll just put you on hold.Maybe some day I'll take you out to the satellite and show you how all this stuff works. It's really incredible.How 'bout tomorrow?What are you going to do, sit home and stew about your ex?Oh, okay. I guess I crossed the line. Sorry.No? Cool. I'll pick you up at six-thirty. On the flip side.Steven!!!! Stev-ey!!!! Let's go!!!!Steven!!!! Hey buddy!!! Come on down!!!Howdy partner. Climb aboard.Thanks for coming out. You know most people think cable is just a simple co-ax that comes out of the wall. They never take the time to understand how it works.We're going to take a ride on the information superhighway.It all started in Lansford, Pennsylvania where Panther Valley Television, with the assistance of Jerrod Electronics, created the first cable television system.I went to Lansford once. It's the Cable Guy's Mecca. It was very emotional.I come here to think sometimes. To clear my head.There she is. Right now she's sending entertainment and information to millions of satisfied citizens.See, I knew the moment I met you that you would appreciate this.The future is now. Soon every American home will integrate their television, phone, and computer. You'll be able to visit the Louvre on one channel, and watch female mud wrestling on another. You can do your shopping at home, or play Mortal Kombat with a friend in Vietnam. There's no end to the possibilities. Come on up! What are you waiting for?!Sometimes I'll sit here and imagine that there are billions of bits of information surging through me.When I was a kid my mom worked nights. Never met dad. But the old TV was always there for me.That's tough. You must have a lot of abandonment issues. Reality isn't \"Father Knows Best,\" it's a kick in the face on Saturday night. But what doesn't kill us makes us stronger, right?So?So, you're pretty love struck about your lady, huh?I hate that.Women are a labyrinth. Can I be frank? I don't think you listen to her. I think you try to tell her what she wants to hear. She wants you to thirst for knowledge about who she is. All the complicated splendor that is woman. When your love is truly giving, it will come back to you ten-fold.Yeah, it was Jerry Springer's final thought on Friday's show.You know what? Women are suckers for \"Sleepless in Seattle.\" It's on HBO this month. That's your bait right there.They all do. Next time you talk to her tell her you're cooking yourself dinner, and watching it by yourself. Sound like you're happier than a pig in shit. She'll come running. Betcha. Then just play it cool.You really want to know my name? You do? Really? It's Ernie Douglas. But my friends call me Chip.Let's just remember right now. You know some people walk through their entire lives and never find a true friend. I guess we're the lucky ones.Later buddy. I'll catch ya' on the flip side.Hey, you guys play here, too? Cool. I was just in the neighborhood. Thought I'd run the court for a couple of innings.We met about a week ago during a routine installation, but I feel like I've known him my whole life.No, I want to be on Steven's team. I'm skins.Wait a sec'. I've got to warm up.Let's get it on!Feed me under the boards and you'll find out.Traveling! That's traveling!All right, so we're playing that type of game. Prison rules. I get it.Feed me the rock! Feed me the rock! I'm open!And one! That's definitely a foul! You want to mug me, my wallet is in my other pants.Don't play from fear Steven. We can take these guys.Take it to the hole!Hey, are you okay?Let's switch. I'll cover Rick.Good game. You were tough out there. Your play brought me up to a higher level. I mean that.It was payback time. I was protecting you.I don't appreciate your tone Steven. That's not the way friends speak to each other.Well let's fix that. Let me buy you a Heineken?Well, uh, I guess we'll talk later. I've got to go shower up and do some stuff. I'll call you if I get a chance. Or you call me or something.And down low.Too slow. Have a good one.Hey Steven. Just checking in. Give me a ring. I'm at 555-4329. What's up Steven? I'm at a pay phone. If you're there pick up. Pick up. Pick up. Okay, I'll be home later. I'll talk to you then.Okay I'm home now. Give me a buzz when you get in. I'll be here pretty much all night. Bye. Hey Steven. Quick question, give me a call when you get a chance. I was just taking a whiz, thought you might have called. Okay later. Sorry, I had call waiting, didn't get to it, thought it might have been you. All right, bye.We're having ourselves quite a little game of phone tag here. You're it! I was just blow drying my hair and I thought I heard the phone ringing. you're a tough man to reach. I guess you're too busy to call your friends.Shit.Is there a problem with your service?Really?So you called me. Interesting how you call when you need something. Is that how you treat people?But calling me back isn't?Why should I help you? I gave you free cable. What have you ever done for me?Tomorrow night, we hang out.God bless you. You're too good to me.All set.That's for effect. See ya' tomorrow Steven. She's pretty. And don't kiss her. Don't even touch her. Fight the urge at all costs. It will pay off later withEnjoy the flick.Sorry about yesterday. I was in kind of a weird mood. How'd things go with you? Keep 'em closed.Don't peek. I want this to be a surprise.Only the best restaurant in town.Okay, here we are. Open sesame.I know what you're thinking. Don't worry, I'm buying.I love this place. I come here twice a week.Oh man, that's my look. I love big butts. Ow, that hurts.There oughta be a law. Man she is hot. It's just not fair.You know what I need right now? Pooooon tang. And I'm not talking about the place in Vietnam.Dost thou have a mug of ale for me and me mate? He has been pitched in battle for a fortnight an has a King's thirst for the beer thust thou might have for thust.There you go.Steven, don't turn around, but there is a woman eyeing you like you are a piece of meat and she hasn't eaten in a week.Shoe's a hottie. I wish she was checking me out. Man -- she is on fire! Total robo-babe.Don't look.Okay, but play it cool. Just turn like you are looking for the waitress.Ha-ha. I'm just messing with your mind. But you fell for it man. You are one horny Indian Chief.So what did you want to rap about?Hold that thought. Show's on.Let the games begin! The Red Knight rules! Blue Knight! You're going down! Going down!Spill his blood! Take his kead! Show no mercy!Come on, get into it, we won!So, what were you saying before?That's why I became a cable guy. To make friends like you. Every time I walk up to a new door, that door is a possibility for friendship. When I walked in your apartment I knew there was something there. I just knew it.We're going to do battle. It'll be fun.No, but I give all the Knights free cable. They said it would be cool if we just went at it for a little while.That's what the armor's for.I cannot listen to any of your instructions for you are my sworn enemy, and are about to meet your demise.I'm trying to kill you.This is just like when Spock had to fight Kirk on 'Star Trek.' Best friends forced to do battle.That's the spirit. Let's give 'em a good show.So that's how it's gonna be, huh? All right. If you want to play rought, Daddy can play rough.The name is Spock. If we don't battle to the death, they'll kill us both. Good-bye Jim.Jim, we have no choice!Well done good sir. You are the victor, but we shall meet again.You've got a real warrior's instinct.If Robin saw you tonight, she would be begging you to take her back. I'm telling you these knights get laid all the time.Easy there Lancelot.Nobody loves ya. Hey, I think I left my staple gun in the living room the other day. Could you be a pal?What do you think?I took the liberty of updating your in home entertainment system. I got you the big screen, plus THX quality sound that would make George Lucas cream in his pants.How else was I supposed to get the stuff in here? Magic?Practically nothing. I have a connection. Preferred customer. I hook him up, he hooks me up.Yes but you give me something so much more valuable friendship.Well, my buddy with the pick-up truck works all week. Is it all right if I leave it here till Saturday?Mm-hmm. Staple gun?Well tonight's not looking too good. How about tomorrow?I knew I'd get you on the phone that way. Listen, that equipment will be history the day after tomorrow. It sure would be a pity to leave that karaoke machine a virgin.Tomorrow night, you are having a karaoke jam. No ifs ands or buts. Well maybe a few butts. Later gator.This is just a sign that you need to live a little. She's having fun, and you should too.Damn right I'm right.I thought you said we were even. You're breaking the rules.Words cannot expressYes it is.Now I'm on a mission. This has got to be the best party ever! Let's rock.These people are acquaintances. They're not ride to the airport friends, like us. Whoa, chick alert at three o'clock. A real barn burner. Don't look.No sirree Steven. This woman is all over you like a lamp-shade.Did it just get hotter in here? Oh, that hurts.I don't know, but she looks pretty available to me. I'd strike while the iron is hot. He who hesitates, masturbates, know what I'm saying?I'm glad you accepted my invitation.Look at him. Have you ever seen him so alive? He's changing, Rick. You've got to learn to live with that.Oooh. How dramatic.Hello everyone. First of all I'd like to thank Steven for being such a terific host.Don't forget to kick in some spinach for the beer. Steven ain't made of money. And I expect some of you to join in the clean up crew.No I really couldn't.Okay, just to stop that guy from begging. This number is dedicated to all of the ladies in the house.Good morning sleepy head. I hope you don't mind, I crashed on the couch. Bacon and eggs coming up.I heard her slip out early this morning.You look like a new man.Hey, it was my treat.You know, I bought this time, you buy next time.You know, the women.Of course she is. Do you think a woman like that would hang out with us if we weren't paying? Don't tell me you didn't know.She's clean I assure you. I tried her out last week to make sure she was top quality, and I'm as healthy as a horse. Not a drip. She's the best, ask any of my friends.I wish I had friends like that.Don't be ashamed of yourself. I know she was a working girl, but she kind of liked you. You might have been able to get a freebie.I'll tell you how to handle that. Don't tell her. You want to get her back, I'll help you get her back.Whatever. I can take a hint. I'll see ya'.No, I'm meeting someone here.You've been working hard. Take a break.My pleasure.Enjoy your mealGood evening sir. Pleasant night, isn't it?But I guess the weather's always pleasant in here. The winters are remarkably mild.If you need anything, just let me know. Anything at all.I'm here to serve you.Most people never bother to take advantage of all my services, for instance \u0096I can help you wash up. Cleanliness is so very important.Then once you're done I have a variety of skin care products which can make you look years younger.This lotion is superb at removing liver spots.This one is an excellent moisturizer.And one can never underestimate the effects of a good cologne.Mm High Karate. And now a touch of powder.Ooh, I almost forget, it's oh so very important to be properly tweezed.You're on a big date, you'll need fresh breath.Whoops, that's not mouth wash. But that reminds me. Proper hair care is a must.Looking good, now let's dry you off.Now suck it. Suck the air!from this angle you look just like Neil Armstrong experiencing G-Force. I believe you have the \"right stuff.\"Don't worry about the tip. But I've got one for you. Stay away from Robin. She's taken.Excuse me, apartment 202 is Robin Harris?It's the Cable Guy.I've got an upgrade order for one Robin Harris. The Rainbow package, that's every pay channel available.Apparently you've got a secret admirer.I can't tell you.No, I promised Steven I wouldn't say.Whoops, I slipped. Well you didn't hear it from me.I'm sorry Steven. I'm just a man.That about does it. Enjoy.I'm proud to say I am. I installed his cable recently, and we just hit it off.Not really. That man is devoted to you. You know I'm probably crossing a boundary telling you this, but he's really crazy about you.Only every five minutes. Quite frankly, I'm sick of hearing it. No, I'm just kidding with you. He's a good man. He mentioned that you guys have had some problems.It always is. You know I asked a woman to marry me once. She said she wanted to think about it. We agreed to take some time apart to re-assess our feelings. To give each other space. Well, she is no longer with us.Sometimes you don't have the time you think you have. Just promise me you'll never go bungee jumping in Mexico.Anyway, I've got to go.Pretty smooth work. I set 'em up, you knock 'em down.Robin. I got her back for you. I juiced her up.Free cable is the ultimate aphrodisiac.I know. I felt bad about the other night, so I wanted to make it up to you. So what are you doing? Do you want to catch a bite?I appreciate your honesty. You're a real straight shooter.Hey, I'm a big boy. It's no big deal. Whatever.Have a good one.Hey, it's Chip Douglas.Your cable guy.I feel kind of weird calling you. It's just I'm worried about Steven.Something isn't right. He hasn't been himself lately. Have you noticed anything?Good.Nope. I'm probably just being a nervous nellie. Let's just keep our eyes open.you're getting THX quality sound that would make George Lucas cream in his pants \u0096 cream in his pants.Hello Steven. I came as soon as I heard.So many questions.I didn't do this to you, you did this to you. You need to learn who your friends are.I taught you a lesson. I can be your best friend, or your worst enemy. I hope you'll choose the latter I mean, the former. You know what I mean.Right now I think you're the one who needs help. I'm here to give you comfort.Come on, touch it.Come on. You need human contact. Touch it.I know how you're feeling right now.I'm here for you.I was just messing with your mind. That was from 'Midnight Express.' Awesome film. Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for the screenplay.Don't you worry about Robin, I'll make sure she's well taken care of.Louis, how'd you like that Tyson fight on Pay Per View? I told you it's more fun when it's Free Per View.Sea shells. Sea shells. Salmon. Salmon. Silverware. Silverware. Suspicious. Suspicious. Sensational. Sensational.Hello. I'm sorry we have to meet under these circumstances.I know we don't know each other very well, but we do have one thing in common, our concern for Steven.If he refuses to admit he has a problem, we may have to let him hit bottom. He's gonna need some tough love.Did he do a name search? 'Cause I work under a pseudonym so the customers won't harass me at home. Kind of like a stripper. My real name is Larry, Larry Tate.(I know, and I'm not mad. He's been cornered, so he's telling some wives tales. He doesn't mean to hurt me.Hey, welcome to the human race. We're not perfect. We all think we have to look like a 'Baywatch' babe and be as witty as 'Seinfeld.' Give yourself a break.Comfort food. Bring it on.You've got a great laugh. Can I make a small request? I'd like to hear it a little more often.You can only come in if you came to rage.Is this guy cool? I'm just joshing. Come on in.And you are a vision. Hello Steven. You're looking rested.Steven, what's with you tonight? I'm getting some really weird energy from you.You can if you like, but I'd hate to have to show Robin this.Come on Steven, let's just have a good time tonight.So Steven is carrying this battle ax, and he's chasing me, swinging like a mad man. I'm yelling at him, 'hey, it's just a show!'Tell me something I don't know. This guy almost took my head off.It's from \"Goodfellas.\" Remember the intro scene at the bar. I'm Johnny Two Times.You'll never catch me copper.I'm gonna wear a disguise.Oh, you got me.Aaah!!! Nobody messes with me and lives!Oh man, you should have seen your face. It was classic.Look what you've done.I guess I did what you didn't have the guts to do.Don't mess with me. I'm feeling like a part of the family, and I like it. You should try it sometime.Are you guys trying to fatten me up? 'Cause if you are, you're doing a damn good job of it.You guys have never played \"Porno Password?\"It's the adult version of the popular television game show. Robin you're on my team. Steven, you're with mom. You're the audience.The password is vagina.Pe-nis. Pe-nis. Pe-nis.Peeee-nis. Peeee-nis.Yes!The password is nipple.Hard HardI wish you did, 'cause we'd be ahead.The password is I'm not sure how to pronounce this, it's either clitoris, or clit-oris.I'm sorry everyone. If I am a nuisance, I will leave. I would never stay where I am not wanted.I'll just go.Steven, what's with you tonight? Robin showed me that birthmark on her left shoulder. It's very sexy.I'm fine. Thank you for a delightful evening. I forgive you.Oh no. It's not over. It's just gettin' started.This man killed his own brother. Some people don't even have a brother......do they Steven? Are you listening to me? Don't shut it off. Don't shut it --You owe me!I just want to hang out. No big deal.Steven, you're just like me. We're cut from the same cloth. We're one and the same!It didn't have to come to this Steven. We could have been blood brothers.Do you feel good now that you've hurt me? Well now I'm going to have to hurt you. I'm going to take away what you hold dearest in the world.Could you hold on a second, I've got call waiting. It'll just be a sec.Sorry about that. Where was I? Oh yeah. You're going to feel my wrath.I wish there was. Oh Steven, I'm just so tired. So very tired.I'm close. So very close.You know, I don't think you're right for Robin. She needs someone who can be sensitive to her needs. Someone who understands her soul.Aren't we the control freak. Looks like you're starting to sweat.Oh yeah? Then why are you picking your face?You're getting closer.Pity, such a nice CD rack. You know sometimes the answer is right under your nose.Really? Tell me more.I'm very interested in learning everything I can about that wacked out cable installer.It sounds like he might hurt somebody.Nosey friends for two hundred. This supposed pal of Steven's is currently residing in the intensive care unit of Good Samaritan Hospital.I'm sorry, you didn't answer in the form of a question.Poor Rick. Seems he had a little accident with the business end of a staple gun.The question is, are you going to get away with it? Apparently there was an anonymous tip placed to the police leading them to a staple gun at the crime scene with your fingerprints all over it.Be right there.I've got to go. We're going to take a romantic stroll on the information superhighway....it all started in Lansford, Pennsylvania where Panther Valley Television, with the assistance of Jerrod Electronics, created the first cable television system.The future is now. Soon every American home will integrate their television, phone, and computer. You'll be able to visit the Louvre on one channel, and watch female mud wrestling on another. You can do your shopping at home, or play a game of Mortal Kombat with a friend in Vietnam.I knew you'd appreciate it. I took Steven here once, and he didn't give a rats ass about my interests.Maybe Steven should be worried about you. So, where was I?Ichabod Crane! The Disney Channel showed it all last month.Let's get ready to ruuuuuummmmbbble!!!!This isn't about Robin, this is about you and me.I'm sorry, I didn't catch the question?Steven you've changed. I like it.I think it's time to make you cable ready.Last time we fought I let you win! Best two out of three!You treat me like the TV! You use me, but you can't live without me!You can't shut me off with your remote control!!!! I'm not like Robin and Rick and Mommy and Daddy and brother and sister and cousin --Yeah Steven. Look out!I've missed you.\"Dry land is not a myth, I've seen it.\" Kevin Costner from Waterworld. I don't know what the fuss was about, the movie ruled, I saw it six times.Isn't it weird that we'vve wound up in this position?Who would have thunk it?You're gonna have to do better than that Steven. Steven. Hey, my lisp is gone.You stupid son of a bitch.I know what your saying. Who does this guy think he is, Jason?I saw that in Trapeze, starring Tony Curtis. He was just on \"Life-styles of the Rich and Famous.\" He still looks terrific.And the race is on.This is such an anti-climactic way to end this.What just happened? Where am I? Oh yeah, I was trying to kill you.It's a sleeper hold. Hulk Hogan used it on Sly Stallone in \"Rocky Three.\" He should wake up in thirty seconds, so let's get going.It didn't have to be this way Steven. I'm just trying to show you the kind of things that can happen when you mistreat people.You know this is just like that secen in that Clint Eastwood movie \"Dirty Harry\" --If this is reality... ...I am outta here.Yeah, but I get really lonely. I mean, look at me.Steven, I think I sat too close to the television. Mommy was right.It's too late for me, but there's a lot of little Cable Boys out there who still have a chance. Say good-bye to the baby- sitter.Damn, that hurt like a mother. What the hell was I thinking?
