You know what makes it taste so good?Corn. Again, the dolly is on the move-- the corn plants strobe past.When you get grass stains on your good pants, you know why the detergent mom uses can get them clean again?That's right. C2rn. A HUGE COMBINE enters frame and turns down a row. The camera follows it. We are in the middle of a massive corn field in SOUTHERN ILLINOIS. The wind creates swells in the corn like a great green and gold sea. The farm equipment accelerates as does Whitacre...There's corn syrup in the capsules you takes for your allergies, com starch in my beer, even corn oil in the paint we're putting on the barn... Corn flies through the air and into the collecting bin..Bacon and eggs is really just corn and corn when you think about what they feed the chickens and the pigs. And when you're good and help with the trash, you know what makes the big green bags biodegradeable? We reach the end of a row. The combine turns to harvest another row REVEALING... A PORSCHE 911 speeding down US HIGHWAY 36...Do you? Alexander hazards a guess.Corn starch. But, Daddy's company didn't come up with that one-- DuPont did... Whitacre tussles his hair. They drive by a GAS STATION in the middle of the cornfields. He continues his ode to corn in his head...Ethanol is made of corn; that's ADM. Car corn. Like gasoline. But they also use it for scotch, gin and vodka ...Corn and tonic... corn gimlet...corn on the rocks.Porsche or Porsh-a. I've heard it both ways. Three years in Germany, I should know that. What's the German word for corn? The word I really like saying is \"kugelschreiber.\" That's \"pen\"-- all those syllables just for \"pen.\"Hey there, howdy. Hey, Kirk, we got to get out and hit some balls ...Morning...Guten Tag... Whitacre scans the room full of busy co-workers. His secretary, LIZ TAYLOR, 35, wears earrings that are EARS OF CORN made of gold.What do they pay Kirk. . .What does a guy like that get...100K...I bet he gets a 100. He's just going to sit behind that desk and ride it into the future...We'll Vet it. We just gotta stay after it. The things eat sugar and that's what we're giving them-- a warm place filled with sugar. They walk into a clean room full of flasks mechanically shaken like paint cans-- it's too loud to speak. Each flask is connected to a feed tube-- the cultures are administered to by a HALF DOZEN BIO TECH WORKERS. Whitacre watches. He focuses on one worker-- she's ASIAN. She adds some nutrients to the feed line.A positive mental attitude is a real important thing. They've done studies where heart patients who have people praying for them actually do better than ones who don't. There's science for you. The cheerleaders might make a difference in the game after all...How do you know what the electrical energy of a thought actually does when it's out there in the world? It's gotta go somewhere...so you might as well smile. Takes less muscles than frowning... Whitacre closes the door on the very loud room.We're still having problems with this virus.The pilgrims loved the corn-- they came for the religious freedom but they stayed for the corn-- but its missing three of your eight essential amino acids-- especially lysine. That's why the Indians ate it with beans or lime. You feed a chicken corn and it gets sick. Yo feed it corn and lysine and it goes from egg to supermarket fryer in six months instead of eight... Whitacre gazes over at a plate of fried chicken, and then at his wife. She has gotten dressed up for dinner. She looks pretty.Breasts and thighs in six months...You look great.They're doing this thing in hydroponics where they're feeding lysine to jumbo shrimp... Imagine you're a sh rimp and one day some corn goes floating by, what do you think about that? Alexander smiles.There's an opening in Mexico-- they might need me to go down there and get things set up...Alex, what do you think about Mexico?I would rather take a lot of pain killers in a. hotel room than jump off a bridge...Or use a gun. A gun on your temple-- why do that? what does that say? Pain killers, definitely... Lie down in a great big hotel bed-What's, that place in Hong Kong on the Kowloon side? The Regent? What a bed! If you think about it, that doesn't mean anything-- it's normal to think thoughts... His secretary, LIZ TAYLOR, buzzes him on the intercom.r-- Yeah?Mark Whitacre.Hey, sure. . .How you guys making out over there?Sixth grade. Marty Blocker used to sell us Charm's Blow Pops for three cents, which was a great deal cuz at Valley Drug they cost a nickel. He said his Dad worked for Charms-- said he invented the Blow Pop and got a special deal-- like a life time supply. Then they opened his locker..cuz of all the ants... In a line.. .His Dad worked for the post office, he came down to the school in his uniform. Nothing ever happened to Marty-- just ants ...He blew off part of his thumb on the 4th of July with an M-80...Mick you're not going to believe what the hell's happened. I think I know the reason why we've been having all these problems at the plant.It's not start-up problems like we thought. It's the Japanese. This guy Fujiwara from Ajinomoto, he's been calling me-- sometimes at work, sometimes at home cuz of the time difference-- you met him, he was here a couple of weeks ago.Well last night he calls me at home just after 8, and Mick, he knew everything. He says to me, `You remember the total nightmare you had during May, June and July?' And before I can ask him what he means he says, `Those months when ADM was losing about seven million dollars a month in the lysine business?' Whitacre stares at Andreas in shock-- no one outside the company should know that. Andreas is still stone faced.I couldn't believe it. But, Mick before I can even ask him how he got those numbers, he starts making little comments about us having microbe problems. Jokes, like he's toying with me. Whitacre is fuming now-- his voice unnaturally high.And then he tells me that one of our highest paid employees is actually an employee of Ajinomoto and is sabotaging the plant. They're injecting some kind of virus into the dextrose and contaminating the whole deal. That's the problem. I'll tell you Mick, it's like Rising Sun, that Crichton book, it's just like it. Fujiwara even said that his boss, Ikeda, would have him killed if he knew he was calling. So I asked him why he was talking to me and he said-- he said-- he wants 10 million dollars. 10 million and he'll tell us who the saboteur is and give us a new lysine bug that's immune to the virus. We could be up and running in three days... Andreas pauses, takes it all in, and then...Uh, um, well I met him a few weeks ago when he came over. And then, he called a couple of times...Very well? No, I can't really say that. Andreas ponders the situation.The birds eat the bugs, the cars eat the birds, the rust eats the cars and the new construction eats the rust... Ginger interrupts Whitacre's grand plan from across the street...The FBI! God, no. Andreas and MARK CHEVIRON, 38, tell Whitacre of his upcoming FBI interview. Cheviron is a barrel chested, linebacker of a man. A former Decatur cop who is now Private Industry's version of a bouncer.I thought I was supposed to be getting him down on the price. That's what you told me to do and I was doing it.But, I already told you guys everything I know. What's the point? Cheviron is annoyed by Whitacre's histrionics.Questions, Jesus.Now, they've got the FBI in on it. First they tell me they're going to pay and be done with it, now they want me to talk to the FBI.I'm really uncomfortable about this, baby. There are a lot of things going on here.I just mean we have to be careful.It's spring time in Nigeria-- you can bet they're loving that. Sitting around watching the days get longer; watching the afternoon go by on their Rolexes and Cartiers. Everyone's just waiting on the mailman... while the poachers make the elephants extinct.He told me he wanted his payments deposited by wire transfer to numbered bank accounts in Switzerland and the Caribbean.Two days ago. But I think he's getting suspicious. I've dragged this out as long as I can. If we don't get back to him soon he may back out?I have an ADM line at my house-- a business line-- they've been coming in on that.So, that's it then. I can go? Shepard hands Whitacre his card. They shake hands.No problem. Thanks for your time.They we're watching me the whole time. Cheviron was in the room. She slips from his arms-- disappointed.I never even got a chance. She doesn't accept his excuse and heads upstairs to bed.I go to Cornell and get a Ph. D. and then to Northwestern and get an MBA-- Mick Andreas gets born with the vice president of the United States as his Godfather. He goes- to the Nixon's for Thanksgiving-- my parents died in a car accident when I was three. I wound up in an orphanage. That was my Thanksgiving ...These photographers must wait forever to get these shots... Although I heard a story that sometimes they'll throw a sandwich on the ground to get the panther to come down out of the tree.. .They're just trying to do their jobs.. .Where's the harm-- the panther gets to eat.Now my family's being threatened, I can't put up with this.They're threatening my daughter. She got a call at school. She's fourteen!She said the guy sounded Asian. They told her Fujiwara couldn't wait.It just happened. He wants an answer. Or, he said she's in trouble.I'm thinking about quitting. Moving my family out of here. I can't do this.He told her to write down the message.I don't want her talking to the FBI, definitely not.She's scared enough.Don't call her...No one's threatening. I, uh... A long painful beat.I made it up. I lied. There wasn't any threat. Cheviron shakes his head in disgust.I'm no good at this. The FBI guy really got to me last night. He's twisting in the wind.I figured if you guys thought my daughter was in danger you'd just pay Fujiwara and all this FBI stuff would go away. It was a stupid move on my part. Whitacre's ashamed.I'm sorry. Stupid, stupid move. He gets up and leaves in humiliation. He wanders through the lobby of ADM in a daze.What am I supposed to do? I didn't get the FBI involved-- I was told we were paying the money. It's like, `Whitacre go out for a long pass,' and then we run the ball. Look, I admitted I made a mistake, that's more than I can say for most people. Hey, when they found out that Mick's Dad, Dwayne, wrote a check to the Watergate Burglars-- did he admit it? Besides these guys probably own the FBI with the money they have. They probably wanted me to move into Dwayne's old house-- because they've got it wired like in a Crichton novel... He wanders into his office.We're into shrimp now, fish, too. Tilapia, it's like Orange Roughie but lighter-they're growing out there next to the corn...Someone told me they bugged the dining room-- the John, too. Might be paying off the waitresses here at the club. That's how business get done. Clients go to relieve themselves. ADM knows...Not funny, Sid.So, where are you off to tomorrow?So, I'll see you in a couple of weeks. She's still digesting what's on the card-- trying to act natural.There should be a TV show about a guy who calls home one day-- and he's there. He answers-- he's talking to himself only it's someone else. He's somehow divided into two and the second one of him drives away and the rest of the show is about him trying to find the guy...It's not like that-- it'll be OK.What do they do in school to the kids who can't keep a secret-- no BMW for those boys.I may tell them at some point, but not now. Right now I'm going to follow the company line.It's more complicated than that. Her face is a mask of determination.I can't, not now. The door bell rings. She opens the door.Good evening, Agent Shepard, this is my wife Ginger. Whitacre knows he has to keep the two of them apart.Right, the office line is upstairs. Shepard and Whitacre head upstairs leaving Ginger behind.It's tomorrow there. When it's ten at night here, it's three in the afternoon in Tokyo...Hit the record button, right.Great. Hey, thanks for coming by, Brian. Have a good night.You gotta minute. Whitacre walks past his wife toward the car. Ginger squeezes his hand as he passes her on the steps.Most of what we do is to impress girls-- I bet there are guys-- like circus guys who fall off the tight rope and on the way down all they think about are girls until they hit the ground-- not even about growing wings real fast-- just girls going by-They were going to find out anyway cuz' of Mick... Who knows what Mick and Dwayne have been telling them about me already.I think they might have it bugged. We're safer out here. Shepard is confused.This used to be Dwayne Andreas' house, you know that?There are things I know, but if I decide to tell you what's going on, could I be prosecuted for it?Everything I told you yesterday about Fujiwara was true-- except one thing. I never received a call from him on the office line. Shepard looks at Whitacre-- he's confused.Before I spoke with you, Mick Andreas and Mark Cheviron coached me on what to say. They told me to tell you that the calls came in on my business line, instead of my home line.What I'm about to tell you involves something very large. This extortion attempt by Fujiwara is nothing compared to it. Shepard says nothing.It involves price fixing in the lysine business. I've been in several meetings with our Japanese and Korean competitors in the past few months where the sole purpose has been to fix prices. ADM made me go to these meetings. Shepard writes furiously, struggling to see in the dark.That's why they wanted me to lie. Fujiwara's calling on my home line. But, so are the people we fix prices with. They didn't want you to hear those conversations so they told me to say the Fujiwara calls came in on the ADM line. But, I knew if you guys ever started looking at the records you'd see all these calls I have to Japan. And that's what scared me. Nobody has more calls than me. If you ever figured out about the price fixing, I'd be the fall guy. Shepard considers the explanation.I'm operating under the direction of Mick and Dwayne Andreas.Mick and Cheviron had me call Fujiwara today and tell him to stop calling until things cool off.They're afraid of what you guys might find out. Can you give me a tape recorder? I can prove this if you give me a tape recorder. I'll take a polygraph if that helps. Shepard is out of pages in his notebook.You're not going to ask questions at ADM about all this? It'd be my job for sure.He seems like a real good guy...I mean just a straight shooter. I think we really got along-- I bet he wouldn't mind if I called him \"Brian\" instead of \"Agent Shepard.\" \"Bri.\" \"Hey, Bri...\" This must be very different for him. Talking to a guy like me instead of a bank robber or a drug dealer...I could see us fishing or whatever. What a good listener-- you don't meet one of those everyday. Shepard takes out his cell phone. We hear ringing on the other end. A sleepy voice answers.They put a recorder on my line.Yeah, and I was instructed that when Fujiwara calls, I'm to record the conversation. Whitacre gets buzzed by his secretary.OK...0K...slow down... tell me what happened... Whitacre listens, leafs through his mail.Does anyone win that Publisher's Clearing House thing? Someone must, right? Otherwise it's against the law...Someone gets a million dollars or someone goes to jail...60 minutes or someone would come after Ed MacMahon. You can't use the US mail that way...And a guy like Ed MacMahon would never get involved...Who can you trust? Your government? Your employer? Your wife? You trust your wife ...OK, but what's the divorce rate?You think the automobile companies can't make a car tomorrow that gets a hundred miles to the gallon... You think the TV networks don't know who's going to win the World Series before the season starts...\"Paranoid\" is what people who are trying to take advantage call you in an effort to get you to drop your guard-- I read that the other day in an in-flight magazine...You told me they were only going to tap one line!That's not true. Not true. I just talked to my wife and some woman named Regina from the phone company called saying both our lines are tapped. My home phone! Cheviron is sick of Whitacre's antics. He doesn't believe a word. It gets a bit heated.Then why would Regina say that?Call my wife. Call Regina. Cheviron's tone becomes condescending-- like he's talking to a sick person.I don't like wool on skin. Not even that merino wool they have at Field's in Chicago. Ginger likes it, cuz it's form fitting, but she likes avocados and who wants that texture in their mouth?Who would make up someone named Regina?It doesn't taste the same-- when Dwayne Andreas got the government to subsidize corn farmers-- it all changed. Corn syrup got to be cheaper than sugar-- so they went with the high fructose corn syrup from ADM.. .They said you couldn't tell the difference, but that's just a lie-Like when they replaced butter with topping at the movies.. .and you know who was behind that...I knew it! I knew it! I knew we should never have done this. I told you, but you wouldn't listen. They said just the office line... Cheviron has to eat shit here in front of Andreas.Sounds to me like you can't keep track of what the FBI is doing. The phone buzzes.I'm working on this deal in Sweden, I have to take this. Whitacre picks up the phone. Andreas and Cheviron continue.Yeah, hey it's good to hear from you.Great. Hey, I got Mr. Andreas in here right now. OK, I'll talk to you soon. He hangs up the phone and turns back to Mick and Terry. Whitacre smiles warmly, and then lies through his teeth.So, what do I do if this Shepard guy calls?It's all there-- Tokyo, Hong Kong, Paris and Mexico City. And under...Whitacre thinks about one thing while discussing another with the agents. He is a gifted man in this capacity. His thoughts take precedence here..Six months later a liter of Pepsi costs five cents more.January-- somewhere in Asia. Paisley takes it all in. He cozies up to Whitacre.Things are going on I don't approve of. I mean, I'm a biochemist-- But, they pulled me into the business side and they're doing things that are illegal. They said.... if I was going to grow with ADM I had to be a part of the business side of things. Rusty pulls the garage down on the cars.When they told me to lie, I had to lie. I lied to you guys and I feel real bad about it. This explains the bind Whitacre finds himself in.That's a good way to put it. You know, when I was a kid my folks died in an automobile accident. I was maybe six at the time and this wealthy man in Ohio adopted me. He owned amusement parks and he did real well for himself, real well. I got a big break-- went to a good school and all-- I adopted two kids of my own. I just want to do the right thing.What do you mean?I was up in Wisconsin last week-- and the guy who is running for Governor...I was told they want funds-- a campaign contribution, but I told them we're already at out limit.Twelve thousand after taxes. The men laugh.I'll let Howard know. He gets out his cell phone and begins dialing. A FEDEX EMPLOYEE walks by with a BUTTERFLY BANDAGE on his nose.There are these butterflies in Central America-- they have poison in their wings. Just enough poison to stop a bird heart. But, the birds know this somehow so they don't eat them... Through the phone we hear...Hi, you've reached Mark Whitacre in ADM's Bioproducts division. Leave a message. Whitacre punches in his code...They're like blue, orange and yellow. . .real pretty-But, poisonous to birds. Over the phone we hear a message.But, there are other ones-- butterflies-- they're orange, blue and yellow, too. But, no poison... Over the phone we hear the next message.They're just flying around looking dangerous-- getting by on their looks. Wilson and Andreas DISCUSS SOME FEMALE EMPLOYEE IN A MOST UNTOWARD WAY. They laugh and wait for Whitacre by the doors.I'm sorry guys I gotta return a call. The plant. I'll meet you. Andreas and Wilson hit the elevator button. Whitacre paces across the lobby and talks on the phone.Yeah, but I'm away now.I think he's out of the picture.I'll let you guys know if I hear anything. I can't talk now. I gotta meeting. Whitacre hangs up. And jogs toward the elevators. Wilson and Andreas hold the door.The German word for \"cup\" is tasse, and saucer-- that's untertasse-- the \"undercup.\" What do we have-- \"cup\" and \"saucer.\" Where does that get you? Whitacre pulls into the dealership and screeches to a halt in front of the BMW SALESMAN. Whitacre smiles and nods.We had a good day at work, Tom. A real good day...It's Mark, Brian. It's been hard for me to return a page. I'm out of the country.I told you, the guy has stopped calling.I think you guys hanging around has really scared ADM straight, too-- word is we're going to do things by the book. Mick said it's over. No more price fixing. A pause. Shepard is confused.Mick sat me down and said 'Mark, we're going to start doing things your way.'Either way? What does \"either way\" mean?I told you, it's a different attitude now, a different approach.Yeah, fine. Kids. Where we're we? Whitacre reaches underneath his suit coat into his shirt pocket and pulls out his pen.One of the Japanese guys told me a story-- this lysine salesman is in a meeting with someone from Conagra or some other company, I don't know-and the client leans forward and says, `I have the same tie as you... only the pattern is reversed.\"-- and then he drops dead. Face down on the.Maybe everyone has a sentence like that; a little time bomb...\"I have the same tie as you... only the patterns reversed.\"I gotta go Bri, Andreas is coming. Whitacre opens his brief case and takes out the micro cassette recorder. He looks at it like it's a murder weapon.I can't live two lives. They just gave me a hundred thousand dollar raise. I can't risk my job for you guys. I've got a family. I'm building stables across the road.The price fixing is over. - .the price of lysine is down to... And then remembering his lie. Feebly.Just a minute, Mick... The windows of the BMW are fogging up.And what if I don't?For how long, Brian? How long does this go on for? Whitacre pushes the buttons on the recorder. He hits eject. There's no tape in the cradle.But, the tapes won't say anything. It's over. Mick said.. .New policy.I didn't make any, OK? I didn't make any because it's over. How can I prove it to you?I like my hands. I think they're probably my favorite part of my body. I think that can be used to my advantage in social situations-- if I can get people focused on my hands then I can get a good result in the meeting.Yes.No.Yes.Yes.No. Whitacre strains to see the read-out to see how he's doing.Yes. And under...No.I wonder where Bob carries his gun. FBI agents have to wear them at all times-- even when they're off duty.Yes.I'd like to see Dwayne Andreas hooked up to one of these.They're all different. Every flake is it's own one-of-a-kind version of itself. And some people still don't believe in God. I mean what more proof do you need than that-- Herndon and Shepard re-enter.Hey, how'd I do?Wait a minute, I watched the machine, I didn't see any changes...I've heard these things, they're not always 100 per cent accurate. I've been telling the truth. Definitely. Herndon plays the bad cop.Okay. Shepard gets another form out of his brief-case. Not a basic 302 this time-- it's A CONFESSION.I made it up. I had to... Shepard and Herndon cringe on his behalf. The floodgates open. Shepard transcribes the confession..We've had problems at the plant with viruses, we're way behind projections. Dwayne was thinking about shutting us down and everyone was on me to fix it. 'Let's just blame it all on Whitacre.' That's how it is there. It was my job they were talking about. We just moved here from Europe-they made me VP.I wanted to be part of the team. I thought it would help my relationship with Mick if he thought I would do something like that.No, that's the full story.I'll give you all the tapes you want. Merry Christmas you guys.Seven thirty A.M., Wednesday, March seventeenth, 1994. I have just parked my car and am now entering the office... Whitacre gets on the elevator with Terry Wilson. Whitacre's a little off this morning... s-- WHITACRE Terrance Wilson, President of our corn businesses, did you speak with our friends in Japan?I heard from Mimoto last night-- he is pissed. He said there's not going to be any peace in lysine until we bring production down like we promised. Theelevator doors opens.He said he'd like to talk to you at some point...That was Terry Wilson talking about setting volume and price levels with our Japanese competitor-- Ajinomoto Corporation. Whitacre enters his own office--- talking to himself.By the way, there was no discussion with Mimoto last night. That was all for illustration purposes only. I wanna make that clear- no discussion with Mimoto last night. He turns off the tape recorder.Right. Absolutely. Not a problem.I think I did on this one. Whitacre gives Herndon another tape and a small box.But, they're good right? I mean, you guys wouldn't believe what goes on at these meetings.I've got well over two million frequent flier miles.. .maybe more. The equivalent of two trips to the moon. I'm pretty much platinum across the board. Free upgrades... sometimes they'll move me from business to first just cuz the computer tells them I'm there...And you can redeem them for anything now...A Movado watch or a fly-fishing vacation in Montana... Whitacre tells the driver...American Embassy please.It's like 5000 miles every time I go to Zurich, Paris, Munich...1 don't even know how many miles are in the Delta account...I just give Ginger the statements... I'm probably one of the youngest guys ever to go over a million miles...I get a letter from the CEO every year thanking me...it's a form letter, but it looks like he's really signing it...They probably walk in one day and he signs like a hundred while he's on the phone... Whitacre gets out of the car and walks into the embassy. Shepard meets him an ushers him into a room where a phone is hooked up to a recorder.Sure, great. You make it some place good for dinner last night?The hotel...What'd you have? The call rings through.Hey, it's Mark Whitacre calling from Paris for Mick Andreas...Hey, it's Mark. I just got out of the lysine meeting... It went great...I think we can keep it at around a buck and a quarter no problem... Andunder... Shepard sneezes.Now what happens? Something you breathe in on an airplane. Some little bacteria and now it's on his hands, the cup, the phone... Probably got it from his kids and now I'll spend the weekend with it in bed...And I'll miss a few days next week, or Alexander'11 run a fever and who pays for that? Where does the FBI weigh in on that- - as a cooperating witness-- what does it say about exposure to airborne contaminants...I3 ADM compensated for me missing work?This is tape seven, side two.. .Chicago, O'hare airport... He looks at himself in the mirror. And then down at his feet. A BLACK CHUCKLE'S CANDY lies on the floor swarmed by ants.That's a big break, right there-- definitely. There's no choices to be made. No debate. It's there-- you're an ant-- you eat it-- you bring it back for the other ants.. .They don't say they'd rather have the cherry flavored one... Real- simple to live like that.Debate and discussion. They just keep the black one from making it home...And we're getting our marching orders from Andreas-it goes all the way up.Why don't you guys just bug the building?Being able to do two things at once is a big part of success. I try and do abdominal exercises... isometrics... even when I'm at a meeting. Tensing. Holding. And then releasing. And there are leg ones I do in the car. I'll even floss in the shower while the conditioner is in my hair. During the part where you're just supposed to leave it in. Those things can really add up to a significant time savings.Hey, Rusty, check this out. Whitacre gets out of the car and places his briefcase on the hood.What do you think?But, wait. Whitacre opens the briefcase and pulls a secret panel to reveal a TAPE RECORDER. He couldn't be more proud.That's a Nagra model number 34-A, right there. The bureau had that custom made for me-- Mark Whitacre secret agent double 0, fourteen.Cuz I'm twice as smart as double 0 seven.She's getting married.Two or three weekends from now.Uh.When polar bears hunt, they crouch down by a hole in the ice and wait for a seal to pop up. They keep one paw over their nose so that they blend in. Cuz' they've got those black noses. They'd blend in perfectly if not for the nose...I'm just gonna hit the head here.So the question is. How do they know their noses are black? From looking at other polar bears? Do they see their reflections in the water? And think, \"I'd be invisible if not for that.\" That seems like a lot of thinking for a bear.There's something great about walking into a conference room when there's a pad of paper and a pencil in front of every chair. . .Most guys with a science background don't get to see what goes on...Usually the hotel's name is embossed on the pencils and they have someone who sharpens them to perfect points like collie dog noses-- that's what they remind me of. Maybe they come from the factory that way. And there's always a plate of danish...danishes?-- an almond thing-- or a cheese danish with a big cherry blob in the middle...The almond thing makes a lot of crumbs and I usually use my pencil to sweep them away like one of those tools professional waiters use at the Decatur Club...Hey, neat.Uh, should we really pat them down?When it's over the board of directors at ADM is gonna understand. They're gonna see the position I was in and that I acted in everyone's best interest, I think that's the only conclusion they can reach...I mean I'm the youngest division President they've ever had and I speak a number of languages fluently...We talked a little bit about it in Paris, but we need to have an understanding on volume.I think some of these ADM guys lie about their golf scores. It doesn't even matter and they still lie about it and that says something about character.I guess I should probably keep this, huh? Shepard freezes the tape triumphantly.Nah, we'll figure something out.Marty, when I hired you, what did you want?But, I went to Wilson and told him you wouldn't work here for less than seventy-five-- and I got it. You were the first guy I hired.I gotta leave town for a couple of days, but when I get back, here's what I want you to do... And under...I like to think of myself as a good gift-giver. It shows that you're thinking about the other person even when they're not right in front of you.So I'll take notes like in Vancouver. Whitacre takes out his Dictaphone and puts it on the bed.Okay.So you want me to make a tape.What if I get caught there?I wonder if Brian and Bob are really allowed to do that-- it seems kind of shady...I probably should've gotten them to sign something just in case. Turned the tables on them seeing how I'm the one going above and beyond the call of duty... He heads out of the mall.No problem, no problem, you lost twenty- thousand tons, but, hey... The group laughs at the WACKY PRICE FIXING JOKE. Whitacre checks his watch.Excuse me...I gotta take a moment.I read this thing about moustaches on the flight back from Zurich...What facial hair says to women about a man's level of honesty. I think maybe it was in Esquire Magazine... Some psychological theory...I should ask Brian and Bob about it- - get the FBI's point of view...Imperial Palace Hotel, side two tape one... Just as he is putting the tape back into his jacket-- the door opens. ONE OF THE LYSINE EXECS enters.Want to get back in there.Most of the guys the government gets to do the tough stuff are probably drug dealers and mafia guys. I'm probably the only guy like me they've ever met--Maybe there's some guy who spied on the Russians and they had to put him in that witness protection unit... It's just me and some Russian guy who's now a girl's soccer coach in New Mexico or something...Yeah, we had to go over some tapes and...I needed to unwind.What's wrong with that?You know they needed to shave me for the tape recorder. They needed to... I'm a part...I'm doing all this for you and the kids. I didn't ask for this-- but I want to give this family everything. That's why I'm working so much.Hey guys, I was in the neighborhood. I got some more tapes.And I've learned some important things recently. I've been told I'm probably going to be the next President of ADM. He glows.And that's not all. I'd say that ten of the products produced by ADM are price fixed.I would estimate that for all the companies involved, the total extra profit is in the range of 800 million to one billion dollars. That's just from the price-fixing.You know, Brian, if all these companies are charged, they're going to be paying an awful lot in fines. Don't you think?Sure, sure I know that. But, I've taken a lot of risks and I need to think about my family.Well, I'd like it if, in their fine, ADM was ordered to pay me ten year's salary.It's only fair. Also, one other thing.I never expected this investigation would go on as long as it has. It's been almost two years and I think I should get total immunity if I agree to cooperate through the end.Oh, no, Bob, that's okay. Let me know if you want to reconsider. Whitacre leaves. Herndon looks at Shepard.These floods out on the Mississippi, you have to think about these. It just looks like some boy scouts and sand bags on the news-right until you have your stock plummet because of crop losses... Then it looks like someone's knee deep in your kids college education looking for their photo albums.. .Brian doesn't understand stock options. He doesn't see what can happen if they take those away from me.We got a deer problem here. They're in the corn, they're eating the small trees, they charge into the road. Too many deer. Take away all the predators and that's going to happen.. .No bears, no coyotes...So now you have all these deer-- weak and desperate.And then one gets sick and they all get sick. Because they're broke and hungry and they make mistakes. Who's fault is that? You can't blame the deer for not having predators...You want to be someone living in some small house? You want to be like those people who can't afford cars for their kids?I don't need God.Hey, Kirk, I'm gonna be heading off to Europe and I was thinking I'd deliver the check for the ABP deal in person.Threonine microbe, they've made some substantial improvements and we need to get it into the market. I got the invoice somewhere... He fishes it out of a pile of papers and slides it across the desk.Nah, I'm gonna see this Thorstensson guy. I'll just hand it to him.ADM: Supermarket to the world.. .We'll have to change that. When it all comes out-- maybe the board'11 want to change the name of the company altogether. Like when all those companies became Beatrice in the 80's. There was that woman, `We're Beatrice...' They made light bulbs and corn and everything... Whitacre enters the SWISS BANK CORPORATION. He approaches AGuten Morgen, Ich mochte Herr Brief finden, bitte? The porter points toward a desk.Danke schon. Whitacre approaches a SECRETARY. Behind him another woman shrieks and falls down. The heel has broken on her shoe. Her papers scatter everywhere-- the secretary smirks at theBrian and Bob always ask me if I do much sightseeing on business trips-They don't understand.We're having another association meeting to work out some issues in lysine-- dividing up volume, setting prices for some markets.There's a price fixing investigation into cement manufacturing there-- it has everybody spooked. Europe's out.Hawaii.I got the association past their fears.The state bird of Hawaii is the Nay Nay-- it's a kind of land based goose and the state motto is va mau ke ea o ka aina i ka pono-- the customer is the enemy and the competitor is your friend.I got a hole-in-one once-- back in Ohio when I was about eighteen. There was a little blurb in the paper and I won a windbreaker from the country club...I still have the news clipping somewhere stashed away for safe keeping...But, mainly I was active in the local 4-H Club. I think 4-H is a real good thing for kids...I got a lot of recognition from them and it's not just some local thing. It's a federal program-- part of the Department of Agriculture. OTHER FBI AGENTS dressed for the links shadow the lysine execs using LONG RANGE RECORDING EQUIPMENT.Okay, Bob. It's gonna be a great meeting.I gotta talk, Bob.I mean, I'm representing ADM. Otherwise, everybody would be suspicious.Definitely.Oh, sure no problem. Whitacre takes off his shirt as the two men face each other in the hotel room-- an uncomfortable moment. Herndon starts spreading shave cream across Whitacre's chest.When it's over I think we'll be friends, all of us. Good friends. I'll have Bob over and Brian and we'll bar-b-que. Maybe not so much with some of the guys over at ADM-- probably not Mick and Terry...But guys like Sid and Marty and Rheinhard we've been through a lot together...What? Whitacre looks down at his chest-- so does everyone else. Whitacre's got some explaining to do.Oh, that. Nah, I had to take this physical for some life insurance the wife wanted. They shaved me for the heart thing. Itches... Whitacre smiles shyly and settles into the pool.It's not really lying when you're doing it to serve some greater purpose...I think that's what God would say-- it's not all cut and dry-- like that and you can't really send a lie out into the world on its own, you wouldn't do that with a child per se...A lie needs the company of other lies-- and so it may look like a lot of lies in the end, but it's really just the first one that counts...Anyone seen my briefcase?No, no. I don't think they have one... . Is my brief case behind the flip-chart?Yeah, it's just there's more of us than we expected. Nothing larger? Really? Can you check again...Call us if anything opens up. It's Whitacre, Mark Whitacre. He hangs up and crosses toward Mimoto.Uh, Mr. Mimoto, I think you might be able to see the easel better...You think Mimoto would be any different in my position? They have guys filing expense reports for sex trips to Bangkok at Ajinomoto Corporation...Any of these guys who have kids and found themselves in a bind with the authorities...What if we just move your chair over here.Competitors are our friends, remember? Customers the enemy. The group nods in agreement with Whitacre's translation. JM SUH of Cheil Corporation takes issue with this. The two argue... Whitacre looks at SUH, who is LOSING HIS HAIR...We have a couple other people joining us I think? MR. CHAUDRET from EUROLYSINE is making himself a fruit plate.That's why there can't be any leaves on the walk. They give it away-Like the ants-- they can see a trail of ants... Mimoto smiles right at Whitacre-- the walls close in, and then, the room bursts into laughter. Whitacre gets it. He smiles back.And seven from the Federal Trade Commission. IT'S ALL A JOKE. More laughter and more knocks. Whitacre goes to the door. Mimoto calls out.Okay. Hey, thanks. Herndon closes the door.When I was signing for the food-- I must've left it.So what are we saying then? Wilson looks at Whitacre like he's an idiot.So, everyone is, uh... They just said so. It's like Whitacre is playing Password.We took the kids one year to the Renaissance festival in Indiana.. .You get to be the White Knight.. .The kids get to ride in the joust against the forces of darkness with a helmet on. And the White Knight always wins, the forces of darkness fall onto an old mattress...It was maybe ninety degrees out and the heat and humidity index-- I can't even remember what the radio said.We were next in line and the mare collapsed-- went down in a heap. Ginger was eating ye olde drumstick and she dropped it in the dirt. The kids were crying and I remember this farmer saying he had a gun in his truck... Just like that. From the White Knight to a gun in the truck-How do you get that back? How does that get to be fair?Hey, Brian, how do you like it? Shepard takes in the car.Real good-- we're going to be taking the lysine prices up again. He hands Shepard an envelope.That's okay, Brian. It's kind of packed with work anyway. Whitacre stops Shepard from opening the case-- he takes the tapes and puts them in his lap.I'll see you at the briefing. Whitacre watches Shepard walk away then opens the briefcase.Marty Allison, Sid Hulse, and the other guys will understand-- they've worked with me.I'm gonna be the only one left. Dwayne will be gone. Mick will be gone. Terry will be gone. I'm going to be the only one who can run ADM.I'm next in line.I'm telling you, they're gonna make me president.They're good. They'll be at an amusement park when you guys make your move.You want me to go and hire an attorney now?Well, I know a lawyer in Decatur...Oh, definitely. He searches his mind for who that might be.You guys still think everything will work out okay for me at the company? They'll take out the bad guys, but I'll be okay?No, it's true. Archer, The \"A\" in ADM, choked to death on a chicken bone in 1947.Attorney? Christ.I saved a guy once at a restaurant in Hong Kong. He was choking on a bone and I got him to throw himself over the back of his chair. He sends me cards on holidays... Just to say thanks...tells me what his kids are studying. He remembers me.Look at that, look at Bob and Terry. Man, I'd love to be a fly on the wall for that one. I was good wasn't I? I seemed scared. Shepard tries to calm him down, get him to focus.What did you say to your guy?Me, too.I bet they tapped the phones-- I always said that about them. I bet it's phone calls.You know, I get phone calls from time to time, Terry.Terry never liked me...He's a dinosaur. A fossil. The Andreas' bully, is all he ever was. He was never going to run the place. Those guys never do, they just use them to find the land mines... MICK ANDREAS, Mid 40's appears in the headlights-- shirt un- tucked, holding a drink.See, the phones.Mick should've been more of a friend to me..I could've turned the tape recorder off and told Brian and Bob I ran out of batteries...They would've believed me. Brian and Bob really trusted me...The metric system never panned out. We all had rulers with inches on one edge and centimeters on the other-- I pronounced it centimiters instead of centimeeters-- and nobody ever corrected me. TheyYou guys were great. I mean you scared the hell out of Terry and you should've seen Mick and the lawyers.And the best part is, they think you gave me the once over.Yeah, and it's good stuff. It's real good. He hands the agents the tape.So, it's pretty much over now. Whitacre nods-- a moment to savor, until...What? What do you mean?Hey, I had to tell my secretary. I told her a long time ago. I just said, \"look I'm working with the FBI on some things, I may be out of touch for a while. That's all... Shepard still glares.And, uh, I've probably mentioned Kathy Dougherty, in my division. She's a dear friend and a trusted ally. I didn't want her to be scared.Like I said, I didn't want her to be scared. And I can trust her. Guys, I can trust her. Shepard glares in harder, his voice cracking.Mmm...Kirk Schmidt. I wanted to let him know it was okay to talk with you `cuz he might not on account of he's loyal to me. Shepard explodes.No, I can't think of anything, Bob.Selenium deficiency in chicks causes reduced growth and pancreatic atrophy and increased mortality. But, does anyone here know that? It's in my Ph. D. Thesis.. .You can solve it with vitamin E. Mick and Terry-most of the people-- they don't even have Ph. D.'s. They wouldn't have the slightest idea about what selenium deficiency can do to a chick. But, I know it, I did the research.Dwayne Andreas, hey, how ya doin'? Sorry about the FBI arresting your son and investigating your company... Maybe you all should've listened to me. The smile vanishes. Is he found out?Great, that's great.Uh, can I ask you something?If I tell you something are you allowed to say anything to Mick or Dwayne?It feels good to talk, to clear the air-- you get to be like a balloon after a while. A balloon looking for a pin to bump into and relieve the pressure. You could get sick from keeping it inside and get a tumor or something..I didn't ask for that. Why should I pay for my own legal fees when I'm not the one who started the price fixing.People get their live's earnings wiped out by these legal entanglements ... I'm gonna pay for that? That's not right, I have kids and Ginger and horses...I have a friend from school who has a law practice and he's always telling me how they can't talk about their cases-Like in The Firm... You can tell them anything and they have to keep to themselves or they get in a lot of trouble-They're boxed. That's what they say, \"boxed.\"I need to tell you that I'm cooperating with the government. The FBI has hundreds of tapes. They know all about lysine. John here agrees I should be getting another lawyer.I'm sorry for what's happened.Hey. . .Good morning.Uh, Mr. Daniel, can't we...But, I'm a VP here... And with that MARK CHEVIRON picks up his briefcase and car keys.How would Brian Shepard like it if he was thrown out of his job? If he was humiliated in front of his secretary? If he even had a secretary. Not very much I'm willing to wager.They threw me out, Brian.Tossed me out of ADM. I'm out. Shepard backs away from Whitacre like he's a leper.You gotta help me. Whitacre looks around-- all the houses have eyes. A LITTLE NEIGHBOR BOY has stopped playing catch with his MOTHER and both are now staring at Whitacre and Shepard-- as are a group of CITY WORKERS fixing a telephone wire.They know. They know it's me, my lawyer told them.I fired him right away, but he told Mick and Dwayne.I thought that, I did. Mick and Dwayne introduced me to this guy and I told him...Mick and Dwayne said they were going to take care of me. Shepard can't believe Whitacre gave himself away.I know, I know I do. I just don't know one. No ideas.You're not mad at me for coming over are you, Bri?Maybe there was, there could've been-- ADM steals technology from the Japanese-- so I wouldn't put it past the Japanese to do the same thing. But after I told them that I made it up the FBI said I didn't have much of a choice.Uh, two and a half years. I was a VP and a cooperating witness. A moment of reflection and then...I've always thought when this was over there'd still be a place for me at ADM. I still got a lot of friends there. The lawyers look at each other.Hey, thanks for taking the time. I really appreciate it. I feel a whole lot better. Whitacre leaves. Epstein and Zaideman try and absorb what they've just heard. Then they burst into hysterical laughter.Any kind of corn will pop-- but not every kind turns itself inside out and gets white and fluffy...I'm sorry you got dragged into this.Did you tell them? I don't think you have to tell them that.But, you didn't tell them?Abe Lincoln was born 45 minutes from here and I've never been to his log cabin. I've seen post cards and I sent the kids there on a field trip. But, I've never gone. I'm sure it's very well preserved. Original beds and dining room tables and the doorways are probably smaller from when people were shorter...It's only 45 minutes away... CU on Whitacre as a sound builds in the car...A small outboard motor we've heard before. Getting LOUDER...And then a voice competes.We better go inside. We can't talk out here.They kept coming back Brian, and they only had ADM's side of things.Me? I told him I had no comment. But, they already had the story. A beat. On the counter is a NEWSPAPER. Whitacre hangs up the phone.I don't owe Brian Shepard the truth..Is Brian Shepard gonna lose his job for that? His standard of living? I've gone to the local junior high school on career day and talked to kids about biochemistry and the kind of career opportunities available...Can Brian Shepard and Bob Herndon say that, I'm the white hat...I did enough for Brain Shepard. Who's gonna take care of me?Baby, you gotta come see this we're on TV.Who picks the kids up for swimming lessons. . .Who has a plaque in the high school for the Mark Whitacre Environmental Award... Where are your friends when it's dump on Mark Whitacre, where's the pot roast and the warm coat?They had warned me that I would need an attorney and told me not to get one tied to ADM, but they didn't stress it...I spent from six to ten that night talking to John Dowd the attorney from ADM. Dowd promised me he wouldn't tell anyone my role. But, the next day someone at ADM called me and said, \"Hey, Dwayne told me you're the mole. You're the one who caused all this...\"I never dreamed of being a whistle blower. And I would tell other people in this kind of situation to take a stand. Try to solve the problem internally. Go to the top.If that doesn't work go to the authorities...The bottom line is that I know my story will eventually be confirmed by the FBI. There's no reason for me to put out a story they're not going to confirm... It would be crazy.It's all on tape, everything that happened.Mark Whitacre.One of the things I've learned in business is that you should always use a person's name in conversation if you want them to feel important... Sid Hulse and Marty Allison think that and they're very successful salesman...It makes people feel like they're definitely being told something they can use... They enter and the HOSTESS gives them a table up front.You got anything open in the back?Just by putting their name in there at the beginning or the end. The men sit at a table in the back. A beat.Brian, Bob, my attorney's telling me not to say anything, but there's something I've wanted to talk about for awhile.They want to talk to me at ADM.Let me throw out some \"hypotheticals.\" I'll talk about some financial situations and you tell me if they're wrong or how serious they might be, OK? For instance, suppose a company gave an executive a car, you know, a corporate car. But instead of driving it to work he drove his personal car and gave the company car to his daughter. Would that be a problem?What about if an executive used a corporate plane for personal use?What if, hypothetically, the activity involved kickbacks by corporate executives?Uh, is this conversation on or off the record?What if the company regularly accepted kickbacks to executives in the form of cash? Shepard drops his fork. Hold on Shepard.Five hundred thousand.It's how things were done there.December of 1991. Shepard can't believe it.By check. They we're deposited in various accounts. And always under 10,000 dollars.Maybe a couple. The agents try and control their anger.Nobody. Herndon loses it.Just what I told you.The 500 and that's it. Definitely. Whitacre nods. He asks hopefully...This isn't going to affect the price-fixing case, is it? The three men get up to leave.I feel good about that. Hey, I don't see what the big deal is. They said help us with the price fixing and I did-- the two things are totally unrelated...Besides, Mick knew about it, definitely... He's the one who taught me to do it in the first place.When you look at what went on with all the price fixing they did or the Federal Building being bombed in Oklahoma City, why are we focusing on me getting a half- million in kick-backs along with everyone else?The moon and the sun are up at the same time...I wonder if there's a name for that. We don't have very many moons compared to other planets. What does Jupiter have? Eleven. They aren't scientists-- Mick and Dwayne-- they don't have Ph. D.'s., but I'm the one having to pull my kids out of school for doing the right thing...They need to dig deep, then they'll find out how high it goes-- it's there they just need to look and they'll see...I only kept a million and a half-- and Mick knew about it, he knew these things went on. They taught me how to do it. Zaideman and Epstein shake their heads.This is everything Jim, what I'm telling you here. I looked everywhere for the bank statements and the records. This is every penny-- I'm not gonna hide anything from you guys.I was never really that good at chemistry in high school. So I kept taking it-- just to get good and wound up with so many chemistry credits I ended up going into Bio- Chem.That's really the truth about that-- I wanted to be a veterinarian when I was kid-- I raised chickens and rabbits ...Biochem was my advisor's idea...Listen, I haven't been telling you the whole truth. I'll clear it up in there today.No. I want to tell them. Hold on Epstein.In early 1992. I learned how things were done there from Mick Andreas. He's the one who taught me how to use embezzlement and kickbacks to make money tax free. Epstein tries to do some damage control.I know the frauds I committed are wrong, and I accept responsibility for them.Primarily by check. I deposited them in my bank account in Decatur. This seems unlikely. Spearing gets angry--I don't really remember the exact name... something like AgriConsulting and Trading, something like that...I. .I've got a lot going on in my life. It's hard to remember.Where did you get that?Umm...I have a few other things to tell you about. Epstein sighs.There were some things I did in Mexico...I raised white mice, too. Chickens and goats and white mice in little cages. They couldn't come in the house. I took care of them-- that was my job outside. One got in one time, I don't know how, and he was found dead by my Mother. This had nothing to do with anything I had done-- he just had died and it was up to me to bring him back to life. I wanted to do the right thing and wear the white hat and that's why I tried to make it all right so he wouldn't have to be dead. All the things I did were for that-- but I couldn't.I'll tell you what, my frustration and anger is all coming from my work with you guys. I mean, this stuff in the papers, my kids read that. It's all, \"Dump on Mark Whitacre.\" It's not right. I'm harassed by the media and Mick and Terry are still going to work in the morning.Ginger... But the damn has burst. She sobs.I think a lot of people would come-- a lot of friends... and people would be surprised by just how many there are. Even folks from ADM... The news media would be there for sure....Everything would come out. Brian and Bob would come and I bet one of them would say something about me. Rheinhard would come up from Mexico. Sid or Marty would tell people what kind of boss I was and how I always brought back presents...You'll be OK here with your mom? Ginger nods groggily. Whitacre leaves the room-- grabbing a PICTURE OF HIS FAMILY from a bedside table.Jesus died on a cross to save others from their sins. Jesus was a hero. I know selfish suicide is forbidden in the bible.However, the bible makes it clear that you sacrifice yourself...If it's the only way to save your loved ones.Bud, pull the car back into the garage. Pull back in before somebody sees me. Rusty pulls the car back in and turns it off. The smoke is still clearing.You...You fucking God. You owe me. You fucking God. After everything I did. Rusty is shocked by the outburst-- this is not the guy he knows at all. He backs away from the car and picks up the garage phone..Walk back in with a bag full of jewelry.That never occurred to me. I mean, I look respectable. Why would they search me? And now they're saying I stole 5 Million dollars. That's what I've been accused of.Yeah. They were paying me 500 grand, but it wasn't enough, I was spending more like eight. So, I took kickbacks. Like I said, it's just what you did if you wanted to be part of the gang at ADM.One time I got a brand new, top of the line bicycle. And I bragged to everyone about it. I told everybody how much it cost. A beat. Then proudly.It cost ninety dollars.They approached me. This doesn't make much sense to Miller.This agent, Brian Shepard came to a number of junior executives at ADM... That's why they approached me. The price fixing hadn't even started yet... Miller is confused by this.Is thatwhereyou keep your files? Is thatsafe?I'm the main witness againstthesepeople. You don't know whoyou're dealing with-- they'lldo anything to win.There's one in Hong Kong. And then there's the bank accounts in Switzerland and Grand Cayman...Other things-There's a lawyer in New York who has a million dollars of mine.No, but I don't need to. The other assets are legal-- definitely.I don't know if I can trust him.I had an Aunt who they said that about, my real parents died when I was pretty young and I was adopted...I understand that. And I want to tell you I feel bad. I'm so sorry, and I feel worst about letting down Brian Shepard and Bob Herndon. Last time we talked I was under a great deal of stress and I said some things that weren't true. I'd like to clear that up. Whitacre is more earnest than ever before-- he begins.The first kickback was in 1992, Mick knew all about it, he told me there'd be plenty of opportunities to take kick backs on Asian and European contracts at ADM.Uh, Sid Hulse...Then there was Rheinhard Richter who I worked with in Mexico. We had some deal that involved...And then there was Marty Allison. Marty's a good friend.Hey, Marty, got a minute. He takes a seat across the desk from Whitacre. Whitacre shows him THE NIGERIAN LETTER.I know people who have made millions on this. My step-father cleaned up.Uh...7.7 Million dollars. But, Mick knew. Like I said, he endorsed these things.He might have though that was a bit much.Well, I think you did a real good job today-- I do know that ADM has been stealing microbes from the Japanese for years and that they use prostitutes to get information from the competition's facility in Iowa. I know that Mick Andreas uses cocaine and I have that on tape-- and there are illegal campaign contributions to both American and foreign politicians... And under...Tomorrow, 3 O'clock... where we talked about.Baby. . .Ginger. They grabbed me. There were two of them. Ginger rushes through the house to the aid of her husband.They wouldn't let me out of the car.I was abducted. They took me for a twenty-minute joy ride and told me that I basically better forget everything that's not on tape.I think we know who sent them.Three to five years? But, ADM's the bad guys.Ginger and I have been talking and we'd like to file a law suit against Brian Shepard and the IJS government.He hit me with a brief case. This is news to Ginger, but she believes it. Epstein doesn't.And he told me to destroy certain tapes that didn't help the case. Epstein throws up his hands.Thanks, Jim. But, we're going to go a different way.I read this study in Time magazine when I was at Cornell-- which is an Ivy league school-- and there were a lot of people who never believed, including my mother, that I would make it to an Ivy league school maybe just Ginger who I met in Marching Band in the 8th grade....and the study said that people had nice, sympathetic feelings about people who were adopted and treated them better. So I made up this adoption story-- and people did treat me better-- and when I got a job one of my professors told the people at Ralston Purina that I was this amazing guy that had accomplished all of this in spite of being adopted-- Whitacre takes out a pair of SCISSORS and goes to work on the letter..and so it was really other people who spread the story not me-- although I admit it was wrong to start it and everything, it was other people who kept it going. Even the people at ADM. My new lawyer sees that.Grandiosity and embellishment-- what they call it when you embellish things-- those are the major symptoms of bipolar disorder. And the other, the second major symptom is poor judgement. And that's something Brian Shepard should have known ; The bipolar disorder is what made me believe I'd be President when it was over... Although there was a time when Mick told me, on a trip to Nebraska, that I could be headed for the top.It's true. Definitely-- it's on his letterhead, he signed it...Well, everybody knew the area code change was coming. Lot's of people ordered new stationery early.I think maybe I should go back to the hospital.I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words, it's been a long five years. I apologize to a lot of people in this room...And to a lot of them who are not in this room for my actions. I realize I hurt a lot of people and I apologize greatly...I am here to accept my punishment. That's all.I like jail. I think it's been good for me... But, the judge isn't done with him.But, I don't think what happened is fair when you look at what happened to me compared to Mick and Terry. I mean, if you go and hold up your local grocery store you might get five years...Mick and Terry held up every grocery store in the world and they only got three... So you tell me how it makes sense that I get nine. I think that's something you should consider, Mr. President, when reviewing my request for pardon.I'd also like to take this opportunity to apologize to Special Agent Brian Shepard on behalf of myself and my wife Ginger, he never hit me with a brief case or told me to destroy tapes. The idea to sue him wasn't mine-- it came from someone at ADM and I shouldn't have listened. I can't remember who. when I was at ADM, I lived so many lives, I wasn't sure who I was. Today, I know more who I am and what I really want out of life. I've completed three post-graduate degrees while in detention. A J.D. which is, of course, a law degree and another advanced degree in the psychology of jury selection. I sleep better in prison than I have in years. My wife has forgiven me and believes that the ordeal with ADM has brought us closer together in a marriage of over 20 years. I hope you will allow me to leave here, so that I can re-join my life with my family and three kids. . .Two of whom are adopted... Especially when you consider that thanks in large part to my testimony the US government has been able to collect over a billion dollars in price- fixing fines from big business. That's it. Thanks. He smiles. The light goes out. The Cameraman starts packing up the equipment. Out of the shadows steps Bob Herndon.Thanks for helping me remember everything Bob. I sure appreciate it. I wish Brian could've come.You tell him, I'm real sorry. Can you do that for me? The funny part is if I'd never gone undercover I would have never stolen 11 million. It was my way out. My severance. What else could I do-- I wrote my own severance.I gotta go, Bob. Herndon does some math.Did I say eleven? Boy, it was only nine. Definitely. The eleven is with interest.The doctor here says I don't need it anymore. I can manage without it now that there's less stress. It was just the stress of the FBI. Herndon turns to leave-- and then he pauses.I don't know Bob, you tell me. He smiles and turns his back on the agent and walks down the hall toward work detail.

We got 150 million dollars in costs over there guys. I can see the fucking thing from my swimming pool and it makes me want to drown myself every morning.I don't want to hear about the damn virus anymore. Terry, what are we losing a month?That's not gonna fly much longer. You want to go in there next quarter and tell the board that we're sucking hind tit on this...cuz' I sure don't. He gives Whitacre a cold, hard, we're--done-fucking-around- glare.Fix the Goddamn plant, or we're gonna shut it down. The last light goes out.Well, I've only been asking you to come up with one for the past eight weeks. I'm all ears. Whitacre paces. His story comes out in a rush of words. Andreas listens silently.How well do you know this guy?So, not very well?Okay, if you hear from him again-- talk him down on the price. I want you to find out the least amount of money he'd settle for. If we can get a bug that's resistant to the virus, it might be worth it...But, I want you to keep this quiet, if there is a mole, we don't want him to know we're onto him.We're not gonna sit back and let the Japs fuck us sideways.Of course he's in. If we got a mole then it's a security issue...We know how the FBI works.. .We can control this. Whitacre has his doubts.You ever mention to Fujiwara where your daughter went to school?I want her to tell the FBI what they said. Andreas moves toward the phone.Then I'll talk to her. Andreas picks up the phone. Whitacre doesn't want that either.If someone's threatening her... A beat. Whitacre collapses-- there's more to this.We've decided that we're not going to be cooperating with any further FBI requests. Whitacre puts it all together. He is outraged. He turns on Cheviron.Damn right. Whitacre picks up the phone. It's not Sweden.You let me know and I'll pass it on to my Dad. But, you're done talking to them...You can go over the limit-- it's just a small fine.If the guy's asking you for money, try not giving it to him and see what happens. Just make sure Dad is behind it... Is Dad asking for them?Okay then.Whatever happened to that girl who was working for us-- didn't she move to California? What's her name, Tina?My Tina is getting married?That won't last for very long. She's kind of a do-do head, you know? She'll be back. I just hope she doesn't get pregnant. Fuck up her body.Nice body. It'd ruin her tits. She's got the greatest tits in the world... He leans in to Whitacre.In the world. Whitacre looks out the window at white billowing clouds.They don't have the balls to mess with ADM.We have a big board of directors. We have public shareholders. Like you, we've suffered. Prices are nowhere near where we hoped they would be. Now the question is, if the market grows, who gets it? Ikeda goes over to the easel and makes a PIE CHART as a visual aid for Andreas' proposal.You gotta remember we have a lot more capacity than we're using. We could be growing twenty thousand tons, isn't that right, Mark? Whitacre is still fiddling with the case.Mark? What're you doing? Andreas crosses the room and, without looking inside at the recorder that is ruining his life, shuts the case.I need your input here.I don't care what you call it, just as long as we get what we want. The men on the tape all laugh. Andreas walksaway.Whitacre and Ikeda shake hands. And then Whitacre ripsoffthe sheet of paper from the easel with the PIE CHART onit.We're going to the lawyers-- I don't want to use the phones.They hit everyone-- my Dad, Schmidt, Randall...They played me a tape-- of me-- some meeting with the fucking japs. I called the lawyers.. .They want us to go there.I really don't think they've got that much and when you factor in everything we've ever done for them .It'll be a ten year thing for the lawyers then there'll be some deal, maybe a fine.. .That's all it'll ever be. Wilson and Andreas get in one car-- Whitacre gets in another.Sorry? What's that? Whitacre shakes Mick Andreas' hand and walks away.

Whitacre is distracted. Ginger cuts up Alexander's food.They got the first wall of the stables up today. You see that?I don't know what I'd think about that.Corky, Alexander says there's a bat in his room.The FBI? Why do you need to talk to the FBI? It's their factory. Let them talk to the FBI.What does that mean, \"things?\"Whatever you do, Corky, no matter what's going on, just be honest with them and tell the truth. Tell the truth no matter what the truth is.You told them the truth, Mark. That's all you can do.Tanya called from school-- she has homework questions for you. Whitacre stands in the vestibule alone. He walks through the big house shutting off lights-- he sits in a chair in the huge living room and leafs through an issue of NATIONALMark got them abroad.Mark's never been to Nigeria.Then you guys can maybe have a chance to play some golf. Whitacre throws an arm around her.Should I get Alexander out of the house?Just tell them everything. We'll leave. I don't like what this company is doing to you.This is a chance to go somewhere else. You said Mexico...Mark, ADM is not more powerful than the FBI. You can't tell me that.Mark, if you don't tell them I will. Behind him the drapes are illuminated by headlights in the drive. He is desperate-- he softly repeats.Are you going to say something or am I? Ginger pushes past him.Brian?A friend who needs his help. She walks down the hall pausing by a window. She can see the two men talking in the car. She turns off the light and gets into bed-- staring at the ceiling.Were you with Brian and Bob all this time?Mark, Brian called-- I know you weren't with him. Busted.Did you go again?You've seen that picture like five times now... She turns on the light to discuss her concerns. Mark is standing there without his shirt on-- A LARGE PATCH OF HAIR is missing from the middle of his chest.What's wrong? Why is your chest shaved, Mark? Why are there holes cut in your suit clothes? Why aren't you a part of this family anymore? Whitacre tries to laugh off her concern. He sits down on the bed and puts her hand on his smooth chest.I need you at home, the kids need you to be their father.I don't know who you work for anymore, Mark. Do you? A beat. He smiles warmly at her.Mark, what are you doing? Whitacre can't tear himself away from the lone leaf.Come inside Mark, what's happening to you? She takes his arm and tries to lead him toward the house, but he turns on her. His eyes are filled with terror. She turns off the blower.You're not better than somebody else because you have more cars or a bigger salary. Or some stables across the road. You used to know that, you used to know what mattered. You need to find that out again-- you need to turn to God. Whitacre stares at the leaf, trying to move it with his will.Mark, are you an idiot?That's totally illogical. How can you possibly stay there when you've dust taken down the company? You think they're going to pat you on the back?It's the FBI, right? They're brainwashing you. Brian Shepard put these ideas in your head to keep you working for him. She storms out-- Whitacre checks his hair in the mirror.He's out of town.Uh, well I don't really know about all that-- like I said, Mark's away just now-But, I'll let him know you stopped by. Ginger watches Kilman drive away and then turns and walks toward the stables.Mark? He left. You can come back. Whitacre emerges from among the tall stalks of corn where he's been watching.We're still getting the threatening phone calls and I know for a fact that Dwayne and Terry have been telling people he wasn't a good worker. That he can't be trusted.He just mopes around here watching the news looking for a glimpse of himself. Or, he calls someone from ADM looking for the latest gossip.He's very proud, you know....I just feel that after everything he's done he should be taken better care of...He said he was going to see you.He worked for you for two and a half years, he risked his career, his home.. .And now you turn your back on him and leave us out here.You'd have nothing without him and you know it. He's just been used by the government and then thrown away cuz' it's a lot easier to go after Mark Whitacre than anyone named Andreas. Whitacre stares at the newspapers.Why? Rusty, what's wrong?I'm not coming down there unless you tell me what's wrong.That Goddam Dwayne Andreas did this to him, Mom. He ought to be killed.Over the last few years he's really changed.He just kept buying things. We have eight cars-- three of them we never even use.I was always the one with the temper and Corky was the happy one-- but that's changed too. Since he said he'd cooperate with the FBI-- he's become so intolerant of everyone...He's had that name since high school. He was like a champagne cork always flying off somewhere.Oh my God...Look at your shirt.. .what happened? As she embraces him we are close on Whitacre...And they sawed the locks off the door like, like mafia thugs.Stop it...Stop it, Mark. You have to stop doing this to yourself, please stop.

Whitacre looks at Cheviron-- there's clearly a right and wrong answer here.I'd like to come out tomorrow and get on that phone.I know it's late. I'll be out of your hair in a minute, just show me where the, uh...The line in question...Any calls since yesterday...I'll give you a call tomorrow and we can test it out.Good night. Good night, Mrs. Whitacre. Shepard walks toward his car. Ginger and Mark linger.You want to go back inside?Bugged? What? Whitacre takes a moment-- but decides to go on.I'm aware of that.I can't provide you with immunity, but any information you tell me about your involvement in criminal activity would be discussed with the US attorney's office in a favorable light. Whitacre stares forward-- a beat. Shepard gets out his notebook.Why did you tell me that you did?Why? Whitacre pauses again. It's too late to turn back.Who told you to participate in these price fixing talks? Whitacre pauses, summons his conviction.They told you to tell him to stop calling?I want to thank you for being honest with me tonight.No, what was said here was confidential. I'm going to speak to my superiors Mark, and then we'll be in touch. Whitacre goes back inside his dark house and heads upstairs-- he seems unburdened.It's Brian. I just got done talking to Whitacre, there's something much bigger going on here..a pound of bacon, a peanut butter sandwich, some vitamins- anything that ADM has a hand in-- it's all fixed, that's what he's telling me. Basically, everyone in this country is the victim of corporate crime by the time they finish breakfast... Medford studies the ingredients of her yogurt.He told me that the motto at ADM is...\"The competitors are our friends, and the customers are our enemies.\"One potential problem I see going forward with ADM is this guy Cheviron. He wants to be kept in the loop on everything we're doing.FBI. Shepard.Yeah, Mark.I really can't answer that.Mark, it's Brian can you talk? Whitacre shifts uncomfortably and tries to cover in front of Mick and Cheviron-- he puts on a phony cheerful voice.I'd like to bring my Supervisor by later, around six.We had a trap and trace device on the home line-- but we can't listen in with that.Did you bring the expense reports we talked about? Whitacre gives them a folder of paperwork.When's the next meeting?You look at yourself as wearing a white hat and they're wearing black hats.Would you be willing to wear a wire? We don't have any other sources at this time. We need your help. Whitacre considers the request-- a chance to be a hero.I'll use my beeper to signal you when it's time to set up a meeting. Shepard gets out his beeper and hits a button- \"BEEEEP.\"When you hear this-- you call me. Then Shepard pulls a tape recorder out of his jacket-- a simple little Radio Shack Dictaphone model. He gives it to Whitacre.The case is getting some attention from the bureau, Mark. There's another agent working with me now. We need to meet.Any word from Fujiwara?The guy is on a plane half his life, and in meetings for the rest.Not yet, Mr. Whitacre believes his life may be in danger....He's closely watched at work and there's reason to believe that ADM has bugged his home. He's under a great deal of pressure. Whitacre looks at the CUP HOLDERS in the Beemer.You should probably take your gun off when you meet him-- weapons make him pretty nervous.You gotta feel for the guy, he tells us the truth one day and wakes up the next with two lives instead of one.We need to know if you had any further contact from Fujiwara?What about the price fixing? Have you been able to make any tapes.What? When did this happen? This conversation.We really need to get together. Both Shepard and Whitacre are losing their patience.He said Andreas called him into a marketing meeting.FBI... .Uh...huh. You're being honest with me, here... It's been months Mark-- we need some tapes.Mark, we could be tracing this phone call...But, you told us...Mark, listen to me, the only logical thing for you to do is cooperate.Then somebody else will and you'll end up being a defendant.I wish I could answer that. Sometimes years. We'll need a lot of tapes-- maybe hundreds.Fine, if that's what he said, then I want to hear the tape. We need tapes, Mark. A beat-- he finally admits it. The windows are completely fogged.Mark, we have some problems...Mark, you don't know how to read a polygraph.I know it's tough keeping it all bottled up inside, keeping it a secret. But, there's only one good choice for you. That's all there's ever been. There's something you're hiding, something you're keeping from us. But, the only way to protect yourself is to be completely honest.You realize this document can be used against you in a court of law. Whitacre nods grimly.And the reason you agreed to help ADM purchase a new bug?If there's anything else you want to add, now's the time. You need to tell us.Hey, Mark you don't really need to narrate the tapes for us when you're making them.Don't force the conversation.You should probably use your ADM credit card... Whitacre dials the phone.I just ate in the hotel...(loud because of the(loud because of theIt's not that easy, Mark. There're a lot legal issues...Look away, Mark, look away... Whitacre's face fills the wide angle lens. Shepard and Herndon huddle around the video monitor. HERNDON IS DRESSED LIKE A UNIFORMED HOTEL WORKER. SHEPARD is still dressed like a G-man from the 50's.What's Mark doing? They pan over to Whitacre. He's OPENING the briefcase with the hidden tape recorder.Don't get bogged down in the words, look at the actions.We got a problem, Mark. You can't take our equipment to Japan. We have no jurisdiction.Well, sure, but there's something else I'd like you to think about.Like I said, we can't give you any recording equipment.I don't know anything about Japanese laws, but if you're arrested, we may not be able to provide much help.You can't use any of our equipment.Thanks, Mark. Come on in.Who told you that?Ten?Can you tell us what products? Whitacre smiles-- he's got something else on his mind.I don't know, they might end up paying. But, nobody knows for sure how this will turn out.What do you mean?Well, Mark...I can't grant you immunity Mark, you know that. Whitacre smiles wishfully like a big kid. Herndon senses that something's up.What was that about?Europe again?Hawaii?So, why are they coming to the US?Thatta boy, Mark.Agreement... you heard it. He hits rewind and plays it again.What do you mean?About eighteen grand a month. He hands her a folder of Whitacre's expenses.It's a beauty. How was Hong Kong?We're gonna wanna hear how the company responds when we move in. Shepard hands him some tapes and batteries. He grabs the BRIEF CASE off the backseat.You want me to load you up right now?Tell them you've decided to cooperate with the government.No, Mark. The town's too small.Now, Mark once this thing starts it's going to be intense. They're going to know that somebody was on the inside working with us. They're going to do almost anything to find out who it is.Why don't we step over there. Wilson is baffled. Whitacre feigns surprise-- they both look to their client.Why don't we talk in the car.Remember what we told you, Mark: tell them that you're cooperating first thing and whatever you do, do not take one of their lawyers.Do you think it went well?That's super, Mark.Mark, who did you tell?Who did you tell about the raid. Shepard is furious, he glares at Whitacre.Why did you do that, Mark? Why did you tell Dougherty?Who else?You could have ruined this entire operation. Two and a half years... Herndon intervenes.Mark, you can't be here.You're jeopardizing everything.Not here, Mark-- on the phone we can set something up.If you need to talk, call me. Whitacre gets back in his car. Shepard watches him drive away-- over his shoulder we hear the phone ringing. Whitacre parks at the far end of the street.Mark, you can't show up at my house. How can you know me if this is a secret investigation?What? What lawyer?A lawyer can't do that, Mark.Who introduced you?Mark, we told you not to talk to an ADM lawyer. We went over that more than once. I think we made it very clear.Let me make a call.Did you talk to them, Mark? What did you say? It's real important that you not talk to the press.We told Mark that he had to expect the unexpected-- that he might be attacked-- that he wasn't going to win any popularity contests for this.Maybe you guys should get out of town until the hearings start.You been playing any golf? Whitacre doesn't want to \"just talk.\"We're not asking you.That shouldn't be a problem.There may be some IRS issues but...It's not ethical but it's done. A beat. Then Whitacre goes on.On. Definitely. Whitacre exhales.How much money are we talking about Mark? Whitacre pauses, clears his throat.When did this start, Mark?You, You... And how were you paid?And did any of these checks come in after we met? Whitacre pauses.Who else knows about this?What are they accusing me of? I want the specifics? Are they saying I'm in cahoots with the guy? Medford and Paisley don't want to answer this.But, how could we know what he was doing? He came to us...Of course, ADM decides Whitacre's a thief as soon as they find out he's working for us.We gotta call Mark.That's it. We're done? I thought the FBI never hung a witness out to dry.You can talk to us about your feelings, but that's it. Shepard puts his coffee cup down near the newspapers.Mark, please understand. This isn't what we want. We've got no choice here.Remember, Mark, we told you it was impossible to predict what would happen when the case went overt.The reason we came today is because we are concerned about your and Mark's well being.This morning?I read the letter from Doctor Miller, Mark. It's not true.The area code ...Mark... He puts the letter in the middle of the table..Area code 847. It says the letter was written in November 1995- - that area code didn't exist then.I thought about that. So I asked the phone company. This is the press release announcing the 847 area code... He puts the release on the table.It's dated six days after your letter was written-- Doctor Miller couldn't have known about it. Whitacre stares at it-- then looks up.I called Miller, Mark. Ginger quietly starts to cry-- picks up the letter.Doctor patient confidentiality doesn't apply to forgeries. Ginger cries harder.

Right now, there's no promise.Be right there lookin' at him. Say, \"listen here you little mousy motherfucker.\" Wilson peels off into his office. Whitacre continues on across the open trading floor toward his office. He speaks under his breath to nobody-- smiling at the world.It'll never work then. A TRAY OF DRINKS attached to a WALKING CENTERFOLD goes by. Wilson leers...That's right, you made it happen.It didn't just go up like that-- you made it happen.What should we play for?We can't be manipulated by these Goddamn buyers. Thank God we have them, but they are not my friends. The men all nod. Whitacre appears pool side and begins to unbutton his Hawaiian shirt. Wilson turns to Ikeda.You're my friend. I want to be closer to you than I am to any customer, cause you can make it so I can make money or I can't make money. And all I want... Nobody is listening to him. They all stare at Whitacre. ADamn Mark, can't you call and get us a bigger room. This is crazy.I'd like to welcome everybody here, glad everyone could make it and sorry for those who can't play golf tomorrow-- we're gonna have a good time. Whitacre's POV-- he scans the room.It's better to be part of the group.If the market is what we think it is... There's a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Conversation ceases.Our preference is to trust each other. If we find someone lyin'-- then we hire some mafia figure and rub you out. The group laughs.If we can't trust each other in the end, it ain't gonna work.What, is there a language problem here?Come on Mark, you're making that up.There you have it from Mark Whitacre, Ph.D. You know what the Ph.D. is for? Piled Higher and Deeper.So, a chicken got Archer-- but fifty years later when you look at our deals with Tyson, Foster Farms-- what's the body count? More laughter. The agents walk up to the table.I have no idea what this is. Wilson gets up from the table. Whitacre is shaken.Do I need an attorney.You have a reason for embarrassing my colleague and I in front of a business prospect?I run the corn business.Nothing. I told him nothing. Slow down.He said he had tapes-- that he'd heard price fixing tapes. . .What the fuck is that? I can't believe they would pull this shit on Dwayne Andreas...

Shepard's cell phone rings. Herndon sighs--Here it comes.Are you married?Have you ever lied to better your position?We're you born in 1957?Did Fujiwara ever telephone you at home and tell you there was a mole at ADM?Before this year did you ever lie to someone you really trusted?Did Fujiwara say he would tell you who the mole was for 10 million dollars?Now, I'm going to ask you the same questions again to make sure the results are consistent. Whitacre nods and smiles. Watches the needle- rock steady.Are you married?Have you ever lied to better your position?You can get dressed, Mark. The door closes and the agents look at each other.Mark, you splattered the walls with ink. Come on now, extortionists don't just leave their name and number then go away.What happened with Fujiwara and the saboteur? A beat.And what about the price fixing? It isn't over is it? There's no \"new attitude.\"We want tapes, mark. He slides the confession across to Whitacre who nods and signs. He gives both agents Christmas cards and smiles.And you can talk less.Give me your pants. Whitacre undoes the pants of his SAGE GREEN SUIT.I told him it was in the lamp.Widen out, Bri, we need a wide shot of these guys working together. Still struggling with the joystick.What an idiot!If this isn't an agreement, then what are they doing there?I don't know how much more we can ask of the guy.But, if you taped the meeting on your own and than gave us the tapes...We're not allowed to say that. But, the sooner we get enough evidence, the sooner you can stop the taping.That's why we need these lysine association meetings on US soil.. .Make it easier to wrap this up. Shepard picks up the recorder.Really?We still need to get everyone together making an actual agreement before we have a case.Hey, Mark, it's kind of warm in here-- why don't you take off your jacket, sit down and we can talk about this.What's his name, Mimoto, we have him saying on tape-- last fall that... He checks a three ring note-book full of transcriptions..they were \"concerned about severe penalties for anti-trust in the US.\" Whitacre smiles, very impressed with himself.Just remember-- I want you to poll the room and get them to use the word \"agreement.\"Let the action come to you.I know that...You can talk. Just don't dominate. We want to see others involvement.It's that time again.He left it in his room.This was left in the lobby. The concierge thought it might belong to one of you gentleman.I wanted everyone to see this. This is Mark Whitacre and his family. The group passes it around. A photo of Whitacre Family smiling in front of their Christmas Tree.I carry this picture with me all the time as a constant reminder that he is a real person with a real family depending on him. The only reason we have these tapes is because of this man.We want to know that when the time comes, if he loses his job, the government is going to stand behind him.No, not now...Excuse me. Mr. Wilson, Mr. Whitacre-- I'm Bob Herndon and I'm an FBI agent. This is Special Agent Shepherd.Mr. Whitacre, if I can ask you to step outside with Agent Shepard and Mr. Wilson, if you could have a seat. The men move away from the table leaving the Visiting Client baffled and all alone-- a STUNNED WAITRESS approaches him.Mr. Wilson you're president over at Archer Daniels Midland Corporation, correct?This is a serious matter. It involves an international investigation into price fixing...We've seen you and your boss, Mick Andreas, conspire with your competitors to fix prices. We've seen you tell others to do it.There are going to be indictments. Search warrants have been issued...and some people, people you know and work with will be going to jail. The MIDDLE AGED MAN drops the hose and goes inside with the FBI agent. Pull back to reveal TWO OTHER HOUSES on the street have FBI CRUISERS parked in their driveways.We're giving you a chance...A chance to be able to look your grandchildren in the eye someday and tell them you did the right thing...I don't think I would change a thing. A phone rings somewhere-- an agent answers.Did you make a tape? Whitacre again reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small tape recorder.Time out. Mark, you know what you did was wrong in our eyes... Whitacre starts to speak.Don't...Don't. Look, we can get past this. But is there anything else we need to know? Anything? A beat. Whitacre regains his composure.He's got to stop talking to people that can really come back to bite him...Where is he now? Beat.Don't tell us anything. You have an attorney now. This isn't like before. Let's just talk. Shepard tries to change the subject.Mark, you understand your lawyer has advised you not to discuss this matter?That's it? That's the hypothetical? The agents try not to laugh. After what Whitacre has given the government-- a little undeclared perk is nothing.Basically, it's the same thing.There are plenty of ways companies try and attract business. Dinners for clients, tickets for sporting events...How much??? Whitacre shrinks from the admission like a puppy who just crapped on the rug.Come on, Mark-- you just said it's how things were done at ADM. Now, is there anything else you're involved in? Anything else you need to tell us?I'm asking you one more time.The question is `were they fixing prices?' Medford and Paisley share a look.Who's counting the money over there if they can just lose 2.5 Million dollars for a few years and then find it in a few hours?We can't see you anymore and if you call us and start to talk about it, we'll have to hang up...And you never told us about the Five Million Dollars you took... Ginger has heard this before and can't hear it again.It's important that you tell the people in Washington everything tomorrow-- one hundred per cent. Whitacre nods. Ginger seethes.Good luck with the appeal, Mark.He still pretty angry.11 million? I thought it came out to nine.Mark, are you still taking your medication?Mark, was it eleven?
