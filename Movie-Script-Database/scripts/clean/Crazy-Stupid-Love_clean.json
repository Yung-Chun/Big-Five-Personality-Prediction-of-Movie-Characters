Okay, let's say it at the same time. One. Two. Three...Please stop.If you keep talking, I'm going to get out of the car.Okay.I'll leave tonight, I'll sign whatever you want me to sign, if you'll just stop talking about it.Okay.Mrs. Weaver told me she wants a divorce so I jumped out of the car. Hope the kids behaved. Come on, I'll drive you home.Oh. I didn't know you were here.Yes.A moving car, yes.I'm sorry you found out this way.Thanks. Jessica, you got your coat?We'll talk to the kids tomorrow. Tell them we're separating. Just separating. We'll do it together.I'll have to tell Nanna. Uch, she's gonna be crushed. But not right now. She's got enough to worry about...So, I hear Stanford early admission, huh. I know your dad is so proud.David Jacobowitz! Are you kidding me!? DAVID FUCKING JACOBOWITZ! GOD DAMN HER!Sorry about that.Hey: do me a favor -- can you not mention what's going on between Mrs. Weaver and I to your parents? It's probably better they hear it from us. Okay?That's my girl.Hey, Jessica? Thanks for listening.You put this to that fake ID you'll need up at Stanford.Yes. Just... yes.Guess what?My wife is having intercourse with someone who isn't me.That's very nice of you to say. She just told me tonight, obviously it came as a bit of a shock and you're not listening anymore.I bet you wouldn't ignore me if I were David Jacobowitz. My wife doesn't ignore David Jacobowitz. She screws him.Gay.I guess the price is right.I'll take it.I guess.Who told you Tracy and I were getting a divorce?I have to go buy furniture now.My wife is sleeping with David Jacobowitz. I need a couch.Sure.I want it in beige.Oh, no, I'm sorry, I'm waiting for a friend.Yeah, well, my wife is screwing David Jacobowitz so eat me.Can't help but notice that you're always surrounded by women. Multiple women.I'm getting divorced. Or, in the process. Gonna be single again.Any advice?So gay.Don't worry about it, here, sit, I've been guarding this stool with my life.It's good to see you, man. I've called you a few times. It's been a rough couple of days, obviously. Nothing I could use more than my old pal Bernie to unload on. Hey, we should play racquetball, when's the last time we played racquetball?I'm sorry, what?Are you breaking up with me?Do you have anything with a worm in it? Because I'd like a gallon of that now.This is my youngest, Molly. Her two favorite things are High School Musical and her mother. I hate both of her two favorite things.CAL WEA--I already have a drink.Okay.My wife is cheating on me with --You know what, I don't need this CRAP --Okay.Yeah, okay.I'm sorry, what?I'll be fine.It was two times --I did that on purpose.Once I'm settled, I'll get the kids so they can see the place.Make sure the lawn gets enough water.You have to fertilize once a month. Not twice a month, not once every two months.The sprinklers turn off behind you.If it rains a lot, you need to shut off the automatic setting.I think it was when you screwed David Jacobowitz.Make sure my azaleas get enough sun.Okay, well, this is it. What do you think? Didn't have a lot of time to house-hunt, but...There's a second bedroom with twin beds so you two can stay over whenever you want! Anytime!Hey, hey. Come on now, you'll visit all the time. Every weekend. It won't be that bad.Listen, baby. What's happening with your mommy and I... it's not what either of us wanted, not what either of us planned.But you need to understand that you kids have done nothing wron--You?Yeah. Why not?Is that so? You in love, buddy?Oh, right, hey, Jess, thanks for COMING --I have to run out really quickly, just for a few hours, and your mother wants you to stay here while she's out hooking --Huh?Yes, well, that's a generous adjective, thank you. Anyhow, Jess is gonna keep an eye on you guys for a few.I know, buddy.My little boy's growing up, Jess. He's in love already, can you believe it?Molly, say bye-bye to Daddy?I'm, uh... I decided to take a class.Okay, well... Molly, last chance!?That's my angel. Back in a few.Nope.What am I doing?What the hell am I doing?No thanks. So what exactly are WE --I dunno. Five hundred?Okay.What the hell!?Those were my favorite shoes.No.What?No. I'm not Steve Jobs.I think this whole thing might have been a bad idea.Ha! I think I read that in GQ.Really?I'm sorry, I'm lost: do you really write for GQ?These are two hundred and thirty dollars. Can't we just go to the Gap?I'm sorry! Don't leave! Jacob immediately heads back inside and answers:What's wrong with the Gap?I'm very warm.What does it do?Oh my God, it does.I like to use a number four on the sides and the back, go longer on the top.Eww.BUT --Items one, three, eleven, and fourteen.Seriously? You just ask her out like that?And it works?Crazy. Okay, I feel kind of stupid but...Can I blouse out the shirt a little? I like to blouse out my shirts a little.Jesus!Tiffany! You would!?Well, that's the meanest thing anyone's ever said to me.Yeah, okay, that was meaner.I notice you only button your shirts up, like, halfway. I can't pull that off, right?We should have some background on each other, no? I'm in insurance, more on the corporate side. My kids are --Sexually?In my entire life?One.What? I married young. We met in high school.Tracy was so damn beautiful. You know those women, the ones who can be wildly sexy and unbelievably cute all at once? I never knew how she did that. I still don't know how she does it. Anyway, we had a bit of a hiccup our senior year but we made it --I miss my wife.CAL ---- Weaver.For what?Oh, no. No, I'm not.Yeah, well, I've been watching LeBron James for years, doesn't mean I can suddenly dunk a basketball.Oh God. Are you going to make me fight someone?You ask if you can buy her a drink.You order her a drink anyway, let it sit there.You deflect it back to her. You never answer questions about yourself.They talk about themselves. A lot.You act really interested. You nod a lot.You compliment them, then you ask if they'd like to come back to your place.No. You confidently tell them you'd like them to come back to your place. Holy shit! You Mr. Miagi'd me!What, no, I'm not ready for -- Hi!Can I buy you a drink, Kate?I'm buying you a drink anyway, Kate, so you might as well tell me what you want.I'm guessing you're a vodka girl, am I right? Yeah? A nice dirty martini? No, no, no: a Grey Goose, rocks, extra lime? C'mon, one drink! Picture those ice cubes clinking together. Mmmm. Can't you taste it?Nothing. We don't want anything. Don't come back here ever.What do you do, Kate?I asked you second.Seriously, what do you do?Teacher. Interesting. I'm very interested in teaching.A teacher with an alcohol dependency no less, I bet that's actually more common than people realize...I'm sorry! I'm supposed to deflect your questions... oh screw it: I'm in corporate insurance. And I have children. Plural. More than one. The only thing I have ONE of, is sexual partners, that would be the woman I recently separated from because she was cheating on me with David Jacobowitz who I wasn't supposed to tell you about either. Kate turns back, curious.I don't know: that you're a perfect combination of sexy and cute -- it was something I said about my wife that's since been corrupted. But I'm tired, and I'm at least fifteen years older than you, and this sweater is called slim fitting but it's really just uncomfortable and itchy.That's what you took away from that?It is?I don't understand. Look at you. Who wouldn't call you again? She looks up. It's not a line, it's a genuine compliment. She smiles warmly. Holy shit, Cal is in!Well, eventually I'm `supposed' to ask you if you want to get out of here. Actually no, I'm supposed to tell you, confidently, that you should come home with me.You're very pretty, Kate. And I can't tell if you're being serious, but I think you should come home with me.I'm not asking you, Kate. I'm telling you: you should come home with me.This is my dumpy apartment that I had to move into when I left my wife.I've never been with a woman besides my ex-wife.I'm worried you have AIDS.Only a little.Show you off to my wife to make her jealous.You're out of your mind.It's ridiculous.Everyone loves the cherry. Look, I'm not rejecting the psuedo- cherry flavors like raspberry or strawberry, anything in the -erry family is allowed. But let's be real here: no one wants the lemon. No one likes the grape.Well then you can't come to my store. They LAUGH, quickly becoming inseparable.Hey, Nanna! I know, it's been forever. Have you been getting out at all? I'll bring you some of that deli you like one night, okay? The kids? They're fine. Kids, say hi to Nanna.Oh, I've been keeping busy. Made a new buddy, I've been spending time with him. Yeah, I'm going to see her tomorrow night. Of course I miss her. You don't know how much I miss... His voice cracks. He turns, sees Robbie staring. He heads into the bathroom with the phone, closes the door.Yeah.Yeah, but no biggie.Hey, what's with the moping?Oh yeah? You like her?But she's your soulmate?Well you can't just give up.I didn't give up.It was slightly more complicated than that. And I'm a different guy now.How old ARE you?Weren't we talking about you?Oh, well turns out I've been buying the wrong size suit for twenty years so...Thank you. You always look great, so...I talked to Nanna yesterday.She sounded like... Nanna. She worries about us.I feel like I'm about to get detention.Which teacher is this?He's a really weird kid, isn't he?I do, too. I'm so glad we switched the babies at the hospital.So, how are things with... How's it going with David?No, I know. Cal looks at his watch, a nervous gesture.Who, me? No. You know me. No, not really.Yeah, well...I miss you, T.I got complacent, I think. You find your soulmate in high school... you've got the game sewed up in the first quarter, you know?I put in an effort when we were younger, didn't I? I'd do anything to make you happy: take you miniature golfing, dancing -- you were such a good dancer.All I ever wanted to do was make you love me. And then you did, really early on. And we got married so young. And I guess... I got lazy. I got boring. And I'm furious at you for what you did. But I don't totally blame you, if that makes any sense?I shouldn't have jumped out of the car. I should have fought for you. You fight for your soulmate. At least that's what our thirteen- year-old tells me.I'll be honest: he scares the shit out of me.Oh God.Really?Um, yes... we've met before.Mrs. Thompson? This is my wife. Tracy.Why don't we head inside?We have a mutual friend.You know, maybe we should focus on Robbie?She's heard it, yes. So in terms of Robbie's progress --We were a little concerned about Robbie's grade on his oral book REPORT --Because usually he's a very strong public speaker --OKAY! ENOUGH!!!I can explain.She's an alcoholic! You can't trust what she says! KATE SCREAMS in horror. Cal races after Tracy. Kate races after Cal.Tracy, wait!Tracy, c'mon! We were separated.Okay, so --Tracy, I love you.It's a funny story, actually --Tracy, wait! Yes, I slept with her! I slept with our son's eighth grade teacher!But all it did was confirm what I already knew: THAT I LOVE, YOU!Before, you were the only woman I'd ever been with or wanted to be with. And now, even after I've been with eleven women, you're STILL...... the only woman I want to be with.I'm your soulmate.HE DESERVED AN `A' ON THAT BOOK REPORT AND YOU KNOW IT!REALLY!!!???Hello?It's fine, it's fine. I'm glad you called. Here: I'll walk you through it. Do you see the little grey door?Pull it down.Now, you see the red button? I wrote `push' on it?Push. Now turn that to the right and stick the match in.Good. Now just close the door and you're good to go.No, anytime. Call anytime with stuff like that. Talk to you later?Nanna's coming over tonight. You guys haven't seen her in a while. Wanna stay for dinner?Your mom's working till five, we'll have to tell her. What do you guys want to do today?Well, there's a shocker.Not if that show's on.Oh, no. Just hellos and goodbyes when we pass you guys off.Beyond your pay-grade, buddy.I will say this though: I got close. We were laughing. Talking about old times, all the things we used to do...Hey. Get your coat.Baby? I'm gonna have to turn off the show.I have to --I'm turning it off --Bernie.Bernie: I'd love to catch up, but I'm doing something at the old house tonight and I'm in a bit of a rush so... yeah. Thanks again for the cologne.Hello?Oh. My. God. It's alive.You abandoned me at my time of need.I bet you did.Okay, whatever.Whoa!!!! Look at you! You do realize you might actually have to answer a question or two about yourself?You've got my number. Hey. Good for you, by the way.Hi, T.Almost. Kids?Twenty-five years ago, Cal Weaver saw Tracy Boyle for the first time, walking the halls of Woodside Middle School --She's right next to you, T.Nanna!What the hell are you doing here?Wait, what's going on?I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON HERE!No. No. No. No.I WAS SEVENTEEN! SHE WAS OUR SENIOR YEAR HICCUP! IT'S WHY WE GOT MARRIED SO YOUNG!YOU NEVER LET ME TALK ABOUT MY CHILDREN!No way -- you and her... no way. End it, now.Well, then I'm going to murder you.Robbie, take the goddamn thing off your mother! Bernie?Bernie, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!Know what?Are you pointing at me?Wait: Jessica is your soulmate?David Jacobowitz!?Stay the hell away from my daughter.I'll kill you.Don't.This man is a lowlife and a WOMANIZER --I'm sorry, what?You may not be able to see it, but I have. Over and over again. You are not to see him any more.Well then I don't have anything else to say to you.GET THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE!I said: GET THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE!AND YOU MADE DAMN SURE OF THAT DIDN'T YOU, SWEETHEART!?She's all yours, David.Go big or go home, right, buddy?What time is it?2:30 would have been sufficient but I appreciate the judgment, Cocktail Waitress. Yes, another drink would be grand.That was uncalled for. Sorry for being a dick.What do you want?I don't know, can you?`Are we going to be mature or act like children?'You still seeing my daughter?Then I have nothing to say to you.Sometimes.I have a lot of vacation days.I hate the beach... you've got a lot of nerve coming here --No, she probably spit in it.You're hanging out with my kids, fantastic! You can teach Robbie how to objectify women, he'll love that.Of course I'm coming.He's not my biggest fan right now.Alright, man-whore, if your lecture on parental responsibility is almost done --I know you. I know what you are. You are not good enough for my daughter. And you will never have my permission nor my approval.Stop!Hi. Hi, everyone.May I have a word with my son? It'll just take a second.I don't know. What are you doing?My son's graduation speech sucks.In fairness, I don't know where he was going but I think we can all agree it was heading in a pretty depressing direction. And I basically wrote it for him. I mean, I didn't literally write it but I sure as hell influenced it, and the kid's already a spitting image of his mother and I'll be damned if this is what he's going to get from me.My son -- not him, my actual son -- he believes in grand romantic gestures. He believes that people have soulmates. And we always want to tell our thirteen-year- olds that they're wrong, that `one day you'll understand, young man.' But maybe it should be the other way around.I met my soulmate when I was fifteen years old. Our first date, we went for ice cream. After, my dad started teasing me about my `first date' the way dads do. And I told him: `stop making a big deal, Dad. I'm going to go on lots of dates with plenty of girls.' That was the first time I ever lied to my father.I met my soulmate when I was fifteen years old. And I have loved her with everything I have for every minute, of every day, ever since she let me buy her that first mint chip ice cream. I have loved her through the birth of our three perfect children, and I have loved her even as I've hated her -- only married couples can truly understand that one. And I don't know what will wind up happening with us -- I don't, Robbie, I'm sorry I can't give you that -- but I promise you this: I will never stop trying. When you find `the one' you never give up trying... and I love you, my amazing boy, for reminding me of that.Hi, Nanna.My perfect girl.I already ordered a gun. I'm not kidding. I ordered a Colt .45 on a shady internet site, I can show you the receipt. If you hurt her, I am prepared to shoot you in the face.Shut up, Jacob.Wow. I like that.Is that a new shirt?Seriously?You okay, buddy?We might have to lock him up.I've been working on it for thirty years, so...I don't know. I'd like to try though. I know I'd like to try.No!", "clean_line": "right hon shouldn eaten bread want share dessert okay babe okay let time stop talking going car okay ll leave tonight ll sign want sign ll stop talking okay

years of marriage, you have nothing to say?I'm unhappy, Cal. I've tried not to be. We've been married so long, somewhere we became... stagnant, you know?Okay, you're not talking and you know that only makes me talk more. Maybe that's good, maybe that's good. Okay...There's this person.We've been spending time together. Lunches, meetings, that kind of stuff...I slept with him. Kind of.No, no kind of. I can't believe I said kind of. That's just not something you do in a kind of way. I slept with someone. There. I said it. I slept with someone. Oh God. It's the worst thing I've ever done but it feels so good to say out loud. I slept with someone. I SLEPT with someone. I slept with SOMEONE. I slept with ... please stop me, please say something.David Jacobowitz. From work. You met him at the Christmas party. You remember that party? They had the giant paper-mach\u00e9 wreath? I kept asking the decorator how he made it? You wore that sweater --The last person in the world I'd ever want to hurt was you, Cal --But the fact that I did, that it could happen at all, I think it just shows how broken we are and --Are you out of your mind!?Okay.Cal!Cal!Cal?I just wanted to say that...Shit.Do you want me to back that thing out of the driveway for you?You have trouble in reverse is all.Three if you count my father's foot.I knew it.I think I'm have a mid-life crisis maybe. Can women have mid-life crisis?In the movies it's always men having them and buying ridiculous yellow Porsches, but I'm not a man and I really don't want a yellow PORSCHE --We got married so young, Cal. And I'm forty-one. And that's so much older than I thought I'd be.And I got really upset with an umpire at Molly's t-ball game last month -- like really upset, like I screamed at him and wished he would die -- and I started feeling like the person I promised I wouldn't turn into, you know?And we haven't been us, not for a long time. And I don't know when you and I stopped being `us' but... I mean, do you?Oh, David. I'm just a little swamped right now so...No, I haven't.I ran track in high school.Thank you.No, I do --David, you've been a great friend to me. And you were the first man in a very long time to make me feel... noticed, I guess? What happened between us that night... it meant something to me. You weren't the only one excited to come to work lately.But now, when I see you, all I see is his face. All I see when I look at you is what I did to my marriage.You see this? I'm saving you from disaster, David, `cause you're asking to pre-board the Titanic. Honestly, do you really want any part of this? Before he can answer... BUZZ! It's Tracy's phone.Right, okay. No, I understand. Of course, right away.Yes, of course. Absolutely, Principal Sapienza, it won't happen again.Seriously?It's been a rough couple of weeks, you deserve a freebie. C'mon, I have to get back to work.They still make kids read The Scarlet Letter, huh?You'd really think someone would have written something better by now.Guess I should take it down, huh?How is he? I've spoken to him but only about bills, or you kids, but... how is he, really?Sorry, that's unfair. Ignore me, I'm almost done here.Oh. Well, good. That's... really good. We'll get take-out for dinner tonight, okay? Think about what you're in the mood for.Yeah. I guess I'm pretty sad, too.You do?Oh God, baby, you're so much like me it's scary. You wound up with all my stuff, Robbie. I'm so sorry.It's my fault, what happened with your father. It's grown-up stuff that I can't talk about but... it's my fault. Not his. So just... be good to him, okay?You promise?David, this is my son, Robbie. Robbie, this is David. We work together.I'll be right back, okay, honey?You ready to go?Wow.You look great, Cal.Well you look great. Really.Me, too. She sound okay to you?Mrs. Thompson. This is the one he pulled The Scarlet Letter Asshole routine on.Yeah. I kind of like him, though.Me, too.Oh... it's not. It wasn't about him, if that means anything.You seeing anyone?Oh. Because you hear things, you know.I had to be. You were such a good miniature golfer.He's a very strange boy, isn't he?I missed you, too.You two know each other?I'm sorry, I'm playing catch-up: how do you two know each other?Leave me alone, Cal!I know, and I cheated, so it doesn't make any sense for me to be mad at you.I can't do this now, Cal.I'm going home.I don't even know who you are.David, stop. Look, I had a nice time, which is a substantial upgrade from the rest of the... times I've been having lately. So, I don't think I'm ready to start dating but my ex clearly is and there's a yogurt shop where they make this eight calorie ice cream that tastes like a laxative, so if you'd like to take me there sometime I guess I wouldn't say no.Oh, Jessica. Hi. Sorry. Jessica, this is my work-friend.He's an accountant named David. David, this is my baby-sitter, Jessica. Okay, David, well everything sounds great. Spreadsheets.It was just for work.Oh, thanks.So how much do I owe yo--What are you talking abo--Jessica?Jessica!Kids! Ice cream!Hi, Cal.So... I'm in the basement. I'm trying to get the water heater working `cause the pilot's out and I don't know how to relight it.I'm sorry to bother you, I just... what do I do?Yeah.Okay, it's down.I got it.Oh, there it goes!Well, thanks, Cal. I... appreciate your help.Yeah. And... thanks again.Baby! What are you wearing!?What is this? What is he doing?Can I take these off, please?Cal: are you seriously doing this in front of the kids?Well, might as well wait for your daughter.No, your other daughter.Hi, Nanna.I want to see the boyfriend!Will someone please take this goddamn thing off me!What's happening?Robbie, please get this off me!Who is she pointing at!?Thank you, Officer.Oh, that's ironic.Cal, stop being unreasona--IT'S NOT YOUR HOUSE ANYMORE, CAL!Nice.I'm terrified of what's going to become of him once he hits puberty.You gave a good eighth grade graduation speech.Do you think we can ever come back from all this, Cal?Things are just so messed up. And it's been such a strange year. I've been in such a strange place. And we have all these problems, so many problems I've lost count, but at the end of the day, I mean, the only thing I know --I am just so glad you took me for that ice cream.It was rocky road by the way.", "clean_line": "yeah thinking want aren going years marriage unhappy cal ve tried ve married long stagnant know okay talking know makes talk maybe good maybe good okay person ve spending time lunches meetings kind stuff slept kind kind believe said kind kind way slept said slept oh god worst thing ve feels good loud slept slept slept slept stop david jacobowitz work met christmas party remember party giant paper mach\u00e9 wreath kept asking decorator wore sweater person world want hurt cal fact happen think shows broken mind okay cal cal cal wanted shit want thing driveway trouble reverse count father foot knew think mid life crisis maybe women mid life crisis movies men having buying ridiculous yellow porsches man want yellow porsche got married young cal older thought got upset umpire molly ball game month like upset like screamed wished die started feeling like person promised wouldn turn know haven long time know stopped mean oh david little swamped right haven ran track high school thank david ve great friend man long time feel noticed guess happened night meant weren excited come work lately face look marriage saving disaster david cause asking pre board titanic honestly want answer buzz tracy phone right okay understand course right away yes course absolutely principal sapienza won happen seriously rough couple weeks deserve freebie mon work kids read scarlet letter huh think written better guess huh ve spoken bills kids sorry unfair ignore oh good good ll dinner tonight okay think mood yeah guess pretty sad oh god baby like scary wound stuff robbie sorry fault happened father grown stuff talk fault good okay promise david son robbie robbie david work ll right okay honey ready wow look great cal look great sound okay mrs thompson pulled scarlet letter asshole routine yeah kind like oh wasn means seeing oh hear things know good miniature golfer strange boy isn missed know sorry playing catch know leave cal know cheated sense mad cal going home know david stop look nice time substantial upgrade rest times ve having lately think ready start dating ex clearly yogurt shop calorie ice cream tastes like laxative like guess wouldn oh jessica hi sorry jessica work friend accountant named david david baby sitter jessica okay david sounds great spreadsheets work oh thanks owe yo talking abo jessica jessica kids ice cream hi cal basement trying water heater working cause pilot know relight sorry bother yeah okay got oh goes thanks cal appreciate help yeah thanks baby wearing cal seriously kids wait daughter daughter hi nanna want boyfriend goddamn thing happening robbie pointing thank officer oh ironic cal stop unreasona house anymore cal nice terrified going hits puberty gave good eighth grade graduation speech think come cal things messed strange year ve strange place problems problems ve lost count end day mean thing know glad took ice cream rocky road way"}, "JACOB": {"raw_line": "Hi. Who looks like a carrot?I think your friend Hannah is sexy.Pretty sure I did.Thirty-three next month.I find you incredibly sexy. It's a fact, not a cheesy pick-up line.There are many attractive women in this bar -- including your friend here -- and I've been unable to take my eyes off you, only you, for the past two hours. Again: not a cheesy pick-up line, just a fact. Answer this quickly, without thinking about your answer: do you find me attractive?Yes you do.I'm an accomplished lover. If you come home with me, I am confident you will leave satisfied. Multiple times.We'll make love and it will be amazing. You'll laugh afterwards and say `I never do this kind of thing.' Then you'll do it again.It is. So now I'm going to ask if I can buy you another drink. If you say yes, we'll have one more cocktail each -- just enough to start losing inhibitions, not enough to get sloppy, after all: I promised to satisfy you.That's right. So, here we go, Hannah: can I buy you a drink?Margarita, rocks, salt.Yeah.Don't start conversations with people while they're pissing.Jacob Palmer.I'd like to buy you a drink, Cal.Let me buy you a drink, Cal.David Jacobowitz, yes, Cal, I've heard. We've all heard. For the last two nights, I've watched you batter every poor soul in this bar with your sad-sack loser sob story.Sit down, Cal.Cal, I'm going to make you an offer, it's probably the best offer you're ever going to get, and you're extremely drunk, so it's wildly important that you don't answer until I've finished and you've taken a few moments to process what I'm saying. Do you understand?As I said, I've been watching you for two days now and I can say, without hesitation, that you are the sorriest man I've ever seen in my life -- don't interrupt, Cal, it's the truth, and you need to hear it. You're sitting there with your Supercut haircut, getting drunk on watered down vodka-cranberries like a fourteen- year-old girl, wearing a 41R jacket when you should be wearing a 40L -- I don't know if I want to help you or euthanize you -- stop drinking out of the goddamn straw, Cal.You asked me for advice before, Cal, so I'm going to help you. I don't know why. Maybe I'm just bored. Maybe all my friends have abandoned me for wives and children and labradoodle puppies, who cares why? Why doesn't matter. The point is, you've got a good face, and a good head of hair, and I'm bored as hell and need a project. So if you want, I'm going to help you rediscover your manhood. Do you remember when it was that you lost it?Doesn't matter, we'll find it. And when we do, when I'm through with you, that wife of yours is going to rue the day she decided to give up on you too early. That's my offer. What do you say?Mall food court, Thursday, six o'clock.You ready to go?You're late. Sbarro's?How much money can you afford to spend on clothes today?Three thousand.We'll start with shoes. Let me see those sneakers you're wearing.Take them off.Other one too, please?Are you in a fraternity, Cal?ARE YOU IN A FRATERNITY, CAL!?Are you Steve Jobs?ARE YOU THE BILLIONAIRE OWNER OF APPLE COMPUTERS?Then you don't need to walk around in New Balance Sneaker, ever. Let's go.Any man can rebuild his entire wardrobe with sixteen simple items.You did. I wrote it.Numbers one and two: pair of dress shoes, pair of loafers. Cal is looking at a pair of ARGYLE SOCKS.Your credit card please?Two suits: one black, one grey. One sports jacket, navy preferred.Take it in there... and there.One pair of quality jeans.No, Cal. We can't just go to the Gap.In Hell, every store is the Gap, that's what's wrong with the Gap, Cal. It's lowest common denominator. Be better than the fucking Gap, Cal.One pair of chinos.Four dress shirts.Three casual button-downs.Two v-neck cashmere sweaters, and finally, a long overcoat.You rub this in around your eyes every night and every morning.It gives you x-ray vision, Cal. It tightens things up. The skin around your eyes looks like Milton Berle's ballsack.Oh, okay. Thanks for that, Vidal Sassoon. Tiffany, hon? Scissor cut, tight on sides, get him some texture up top, take off about... He touches Cal's hair, measures it between his fingers.... inch off the top.What are you putting on?Perfect. You smell great by the way.What are you doing tonight?That's okay, I do.Yes, Cal, just like that.Yep.Shut up, Cal. You'd fuck him, right?You see that, Cal? The simple act of opening your mouth instantly causes Tiffany to lose interest in sleeping with you. Your personality is actually your weakest link.No, Cal. The meanest thing anyone's ever said to you is this: your wife cheated on you because you lost sight of what it took to keep her content at home -- as a man, as a husband, and probably as a lover.No. Listen, Cal, I'm going to be calling women over to our table shortly.Cal, the only thing I care less about than corporate insurance are your kids. Here's the only thing I need to know: how many women have you been with?Yes.No, synchronized swimming. Yes, Cal. Sexually.Wow, okay... wow. Not at a time? Total?Cal, I literally stopped listening at `Tracy.' Okay, here we go.Shut up, Cal.Hi. Jacob Palmer.Don't.Can I get you a drink, Amy?Tell me about yourself. What do you do?It does to me.It does to me.Listen, I'm going to be honest: it's getting late and I think you're interesting. I also think you're one of those rare women who manages to be both wildly sexy and incredibly cute all at once.Let's get out of here. I know it's forward of me but just... I think we should get out of here.I think we should get out of here.I think we should get out of here.I think you're ready, Cal.To talk to a woman, take a woman home.You've been watching me do it for two weeks.Cal, do you remember the part in Karate Kid, where Mr. Miagi keeps having the kid wax the car and the kid gets all bent out of shape because he doesn't see the point, but the movements were actually building blocks for throwing and blocking punches?Cal, what's the first thing I do when a woman sits down?And what if she says no?When she asks me a question about myself?And what happens?And what do I do?And at the end of the night?Do I ask?Oh, and no talking about your job, your children, your pathetic sexual history, or David Jacobowitz. Okay, here we go...Cal, this is Kate. Kate, Cal.... it would work!What do college guys hate? Doing laundry. What do they love? Strippers. It's a strip club where they can do their laundry.And yours isn't? A candy store that only sells red candy.I like grape.What? What did she say?Yes.Yes.Yes.Is that a compliment?I thought you would. Drink?Cheers.What?Yes. That's how it normally works.Yes.At some point, yes, I was under the impression that was your plan.I'm getting that.You're adorable.I don't think people say `bang' anymore.What?Now take off yours.In the bedroom is preferable.I'm glad you like it.No.I do.Five thousand doll--Do me a favor. Ask me a question about myself.C'mon, one question.Absolutely. Now, come on, I'll answer anything. You can ask me about my job, or past GIRLFRIENDS --Icy... I guess? Not cruel, but cold. Very cold.He died, long time ago. Left us a lot of money, which is how I have...Stuff like this.My dad was the opposite of my mom, actually...Hey, Cal.I'm sorry. I know I've been out of circulation.I've been a little... things have gotten a bit... I met a woman.No, I mean, I've been spending a lot of time with her. This woman. One woman.Actually, tonight... I'm going to meet her mother.Gotta go. Grab a beer next week?Thanks.Cal?What the hell are you doing here?WHAT THE HELL IS A NANNA!?Oh, God.HOW THE HELL DO YOU HAVE A 24-YEAR- OLD DAUGHTER!?WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL ME THAT?Well, that's not going to happen.David Jacobowitz!You know how much misery you've put this poor bastard through!?CAL --Cal, c'mon --Ah, it's okay, I deserved it.It's a nice sweatsuit, Cal.Can I sit?Okay, are we going to be mature about this, or act like children?Okay, so like children then. Move over.I'd like to talk.Yes.Cal. Cal, look at me.You been hanging out here a lot?Must be missing a lot of work.Some vacation.You want a sip?Your kids miss you.His eighth grade graduation is next week. You coming?Well you haven't exactly been around for him, Cal.Oh, that's a good excuse --I love her, Cal.I've never been in love before. Honestly, I've never even been in `like' before. I never got it. I saw people in love -- I saw weakness. I heard them say the things they said, and do the things they do, it all just seemed so... so pathetic.She's my perfect combination of everything, Cal.I'll see you at graduation.Cal, I'm not going to --Hannah took me to the Gap. It's actually not as bad as I thought.Of course not, Cal. It's the Gap.
