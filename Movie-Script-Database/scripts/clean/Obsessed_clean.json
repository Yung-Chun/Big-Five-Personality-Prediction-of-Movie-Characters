What goes on in that twisted mind of yours. It doesn't matter because the truth is, there's never going to be anything between us. So go ahead, Lisa... do your worst.Not tonight, man. I'm sticking to ice tea.I know how it sounds but, yeah, that's pretty much it.There WAS NO affair.Maybe I was too nice to her, said something she took the wrong way, I don't know. All I know is I did not lead her on.None. I don't even know how she got in my room.Doesn't that prove she did this on her own?She never had a key.How is she?You think I encouraged it?Beth...Stop it, Beth. You know I never said those things.If I did, it wasn't intentional.I was passed out... drunk. Nothing happened.I love you, Beth. I love Kyle and the life we have together. I would never do anything to screw that up. This girl is disturbed. She's seriously disturbed and for some reason, she fixated on me.I don't know. She's crazy.I know.At first I thought it was no big deal. And then... I was just embarrassed. I didn't know how to explain it to you without looking...I said I was wrong.What?Don't do this, Beth. You'll make yourself sick.Honey, I know I screwed up...Beth, don't --There was no impropriety, Joe. This is just the sick fantasy of a very disturbed girl.There was no sexual harassment. If anything, I'm the one who was sexually harassed. I can't believe this is happening to me. It's like a nightmare.Goddamit, Joe, if there's an injured party here, it's me.That's not going to happen because there's nothing to find out.But Ganz is my client --She obviously ordered the flowers for herself.My secretary keeps all my personal information on her computer. Lisa must have accessed it when she was working my desk.More?This is... none of this ever happened. I was never at her apartment. I never even touched her, let alone did any of this...You can't possibly believe this.There's got to be something I can do to protect myself... my family.Why not?Well, I can't say I'm unhappy to hear she's gone. Maybe now she can get the help she needs.\"Four little ducks went out one day... over the hill and far away...\"Come on, honey. Samantha knows what to do, don't you?No way.

Unless you think you should take him alone.Someone was here? Inside the house?How long since she was here?Kyle...he doctor says he's fine.Now what? Am I supposed to go out and buy a gun or something?No, but she could have. Is that the message she's trying to send?It's all right, it's all right...Who are you calling?You're not...She won't be there.Beth, why are you doing this?Make sure you set this.It can't go on much longer. They're bound to pick her up soon.Yeah?Thanks. Hi, honey. Everything okay?What's wrong?I'm gonna be stuck here pretty late but I could drive down after...Are you sure?All right. Say hi to your dad and tell your mom everything's going to be fine, I love her. And call me when you're leaving the house.Good. Did you set the alarm?Lisa?Beth --Beth, I spoke to Reyes.

You worried somebody's gonna catch us?We woke up a little grumpy this morning, didn't we?I thought you might need an excuse to get out of there. How about some lunch?It's gorgeous outside and I made a reservation at --The morning after?But you can't remember, can you?Derek, not so loud. You'll cause a scene.What are you doing?Why are you trying to ruin this?Don't say that.What's wrong with you? You're acting like a stranger.You think you can use me, then throw me away? I'm not some piece of garbage, Derek. I'm a human being...Come in. I'm sorry I'm such a mess but they won't let me take a shower or wash my hair. Apparently I'm still on suicide watch.Well, still a bit groggy from the medication. But it isn't stopping me from feeling ashamed for all the trouble I've caused.Have you spoken to Derek?And he's all right?Derek.Why?Then why did he send these? Really?A few hours ago. They're lovely, aren't they?Didn't Derek tell you?There's not a lot to tell. We got together at the hotel and you can guess what we did.Of course.He's just being a gentleman, trying to protect me.The next day when Derek told me his wife wouldn't give him a divorce and that we could never see each other again, I guess I over reacted.He was thinking about his little boy, Kyle... what the breakup might do to him. He's not even two, you know. My parents broke up when I was pretty young. It leaves a scar that never really heals.I'm not a home-wrecker. I'm not stealing him away. Their marriage is dead and Beth is in denial. It can't be easy to find out that the man she loves is in love with another woman. I just hope she doesn't do something foolish. strange smile) You know the old saying.\"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.\"Lisa's left town. She was released in the custody of an older sister yesterday. Her sister flew down from San Francisco and took her back. Lisa's agreed to check herself into a neuropsychiatric hospital up there.Hi, I'm Beth's friend Allie. She's expecting me.Out?What? Beth told me to drop by. That's strange. Oh well, I have something for Kyle. I'll just run up and give it to him.Oh, I won't wake him.But I'm here right now. Why should I... oh, I see. Just doing your duty. Good girl. You know what, let me call Beth.Thanks, Samantha. Nice meeting you.She took him! She took my baby!Patrick, don't be such a drama queen. I thought we were friends.Well?No!Please... I'm sorry...He doesn't love you! I'm the one he wants! Why can't you get that through your head?Please... Beth...Please. I'll go... I'll leave... I swear I'll never bother you again...Derek!Derek!
