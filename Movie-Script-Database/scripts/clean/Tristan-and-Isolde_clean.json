I will be ready. I know I will.Let me go and win you a wife. She can make peace without spilling one drop of blood, and maybe heal a wound from which you still lack.How do I look?Tristan of Aragon.Yield!On behalf of Cornwall, I offer your daughter a place on our throne. The throne of England, united behind one leader.You said your name was Bragnae. Why did you do that?I can't. I won you in my King's name.It doesn't matter.Your marriage will end a hundred years of bloodshed.Isolde. You will live with this. We must.That place does not exist.Might I stay here a while?I can tell. Laughing at the market, holding hands, a caress on the neck when he pours you wine.Yes well, I must confess I thought you might find more difficulties in performing your duty.I live in torture thinking of these moments. With every look he gives you I get sicker and sicker. There is a burning in me, I feel on fire and guilt and I can't get rid of either. Does it make you happy to know that?I can\u0092t be your second. Melot must be. He is blood. Besides, I wish to journey north.I find these walls a prison.Everything I want seems misplaced.Then I am your second.No!I can!There are other things to live for. Duty.

Why?No. It was her heart.What do you think is really out there?I want to see it. Do you know what the future looks like Bragnae?Am I just a chattel to be traded at your pleasure?

Just sleep... sleep.It\u0092s alright, you don\u0092t need that! I forgot to tell him about you...Sorry... She\u0092s... My maid. Sworn to silence. Um... lie down please. Please?It\u0092s good you are remembering things. This might sting. Do you remember anything else? The boat I found you in? How you got this? Too many questions. Here keep it dry. Here I found bread, you have water and fire. The ocean is outside if you wish a bath. You won\u0092t know where you are going so please don\u0092t try to leave. Just trust me.I\u0092ll be backThen we\u0092ve got him prisoner.I had noticed. Yes I have a bit.Bragnae and I were spying the convent of Brittes ].Some women need it.Any word of my betrothed?Oh, I think it's better if we don't bother with names.You just did. If you insist... my name is Bragnae. I'm a lady in waiting at the court. My parents are dead. My mother, she is the source of the kindness you find so puzzling. My father would've left you where you fell.Well Tristan of Aragon, I'd guess about you too, but I think I've already seen everything.There. What of your parents?Of what?Sorry.Tomorrow then?There she who bore you brought you forth.I happen to believe what that says. Don\u0092t you think there is more to life?Something more than duty and death! Why are we capable of feelings if not to have them? Why long for things if they are not meant to be ours? Well don\u0092t listen to me. You\u0092re so sure of things. You\u0092re certainty, it\u0092s like armour. I wish I had that.The joy of being a lady? Wanting something I can\u0092t have. A life of my own.I\u0092ll follow you later.Yes.Dark. Tall. Nearly twice your size. An absolute gentleman.I didn\u0092t know what I was talking about.Outside, just past that bluff there is a boat. That\u0092s how you should go when you leave. You should go soon.I don\u0092t knowTristan! They\u0092ve found your boat. At this very moment the King himself is scouring the coast. He will find you. He finds everyone. The tide is coming let\u0092s go!I can\u0092tTristan, we\u0092ve both known this can\u0092t be. We\u0092ve known this from the start. That doesn\u0092t mean it isn\u0092t true. It is. It just cannot be. I want to know that you are alive somewhere thinking of me from time to time. I want to know that there is more to this life and I can\u0092t know that if they kill you. Please?Go!\"My face in thine eyes, thine in mine appears,No, not quite. If I am to be a present I should be fully wrapped.I\u0092m yours.You risked your life to give me to another man.Oh what have I done? Stop this thing. Say something.But I am yours. You touched me and I yielded...It is the only thing that matters Tristan. Leave with me, I will go anywhere.My marriage to another man!Don't do this to me.My Lord.If things were different. If we lived in a place without duty... would you be with me?I'll pretend it's you.It was a present.Perhaps someone his own age should speak with him.They believe you are distant. They are worried about you. So am I.He is my husband. I remember his Kingdom comes before my life.Am I not permitted a single moment without mourning? Living with this Tristan as you said we must.The Roman Bridge. I can get to it without being seen. And I will go there anytime to be there with you.Why?But they are not life Tristan. They are the shells of life. And empty ones and in the end all they hold is days and days without love. Love is made by God. Ignore it and you can suffer as you cannot imagine.Late?How many did you love before me?And after me?What do you think became of them?I find myself imaging things in this place. I decorate it. Books, a harp there... a child.I would have no way to tell, would I? He is a kind man Tristan, I cannot hate him. Yesterday at the market I saw a couple holding hands, and I realised we would never do that. Never anything like it. No picnics or unguarded smiles. No rings. Just stolen moments that leave too quickly.I hate this.Then don\u0092t.There is a servings child, quite ill. Doing better now.Is it?I\u0092m fine.Why did you burn it?Meet me there in an hour or I\u0092ll die.I\u0092m just feeling a little weary that\u0092s all. I might just go and have a lie down.I miss IrelandThat\u0092s like asking me to stop breathing.Please don\u0092t leave me. Please!It\u0092s not like that.Since you thought he was dead. I found him wounded on the beach in Ireland. I hid him from my father and I told him my name was Bragnae. So when he came to the tournament at Dunluce to win Donnchadh\u0092s daughter he didn\u0092t realise it was me. All this time my heart has been his, and I am sorry. He tried harder than you can possibly imagine because he loves you.I told him about Ireland. He\u0092s given us our freedom. Why does loving you feel so wrong?Tristan, if I do this.Tristan, don\u0092t! Tristan! Tristan! Tristan! Why?! Tristan!Know that I love you Tristan.
