I'm filming all your shit from now on.Mom? Will you say hi to the camera?The millions of people watching at home.No, you look great.Oh yeah, definitely.Oh, yeah, thanks.I'm filming things now. I'm filming everything.For my mom. I'm trying to get custody of her from my dad. She's getting worse, and he's not...helping, and this way, in case something goes down-Right, it'd be evidence.Well, yeah, to add context.What is that?For school?Yeah, right.Are you not coming in?You're going to miss first period-Okay, okay.This is my school, I guess. This is the hallway-...yeah-Bryce, gimme my camera back-Hey, Bryce, come on, give it back-Oh come on...This is where I eat lunch, out here on the bleachers.Hey-I wasn't, videotaping you, so much as I was just-...okay.Yes.I thought Haven Hills was closed.Why are you telling me?...Nah...I don't like parties.I'll think about it.Yeah?It has a purpose-I'm uploading what I shot today...you have to keep a back-up, you know.Are you sure it's here? Are you sure it's here, this all looks closed-Oh yeah.What?What am I supposed to do? I thought you said you didn't want to go alone-Oh, I don't- just filming.What?No, I wasn't filming anyone specific, just filming the party.Okay.Okay-What-I'm Andrew.No, I know.Everybody knows who you are.What? I don't-I don't-Look, I don't think we're supposed to-Oh, I don't- Hm, I don't know-What were you guys doing out here? This is way out-Matt's out here?The what?You remember that?I'm gonna be so rich when you're president, you have no idea-Matt?We're not supposed to be out here.Guys-Guys, just don't like- don't push me, or do anything like that-...It's like, whispering?Singing?What is that?I don't know, probably...I mean, it's- it's kinda loud, right?No, I don't- I mean, I won't do th-Hey, wait-Hello-Does it go down much deeper, or-Do you think it could be like wind, or-Then what do you think it is?Who said anything about ghosts.Steve's up ahead-I don't know what you're talking about.Don't talk about it, you're making me nervous.No.I don't wanna film it, it's messing with the camera-Guys maybe...maybe we shouldn't...WHAT? I can't hear you over the- you know-Rolling, yeah.Ah, shit.The trick is to pretend like it's on a plate. You get it on the plate and then you wrap the plate around it, and you can move it however you want.Yeah? Plate's easier for me.Try to imagine that your squeezing the entire piece in your hand.Really? Andrew points at the lego set, and it flies together.Because we're his mistress.I told you, it's just my thing for right now.Maybe I want a barrier.My dad is actually a fireman, or was, I don't know. He got injured like two years ago, and now they just pay him out of, like, insurance. He doesn't do anything, I mean he goes out during the day, but I don't know where. He drinks a lot.I do computer repair, and stuff. I actually make a lot of money...My mom has spinal meningitis, she's- she can't work or anything, and the insurance doesn't cover all of her medicine, so a lot of my money has to go into that. I figure if I get enough on camera, maybe I can, I dunno, get custody of her or something.Yeah?...That's intense.How-Haha no of course, no way.Ew-Couldn't that metaphor just be for any muscle in the human body, like working out or-I think it's time we took this out of the backyard. Matt and Steve look confused.I got it.I got this. One of the teddy bears suddenly comes to life, waving at the little boy. The little boy is wowed. The teddy bear suddenly takes off and flies through the air. Again the stifled laughter.Umm... Got him.Hey Matt. Do you like me?Why not?You're an asshole.You know, you...If you hadn't invited me to that party, none of this would've happened.Thanks.Yeah, until all those chicks showed up.Are you sure there's no one around-You just need focus, Matt.You're lucky you got the kleenex, I'm stuck with the taco bell wrapper.Her face, I can't get her face out of my head.Here, take the camera, take the camera.Abracadabra.I didn't mean to, I didn't-Guys, just calm down, I'm sorry, okay-You don't have to- I mean I can-Are you mad?Is he okay?Is that the cops, are you calling the cops?I don't see how you guys can be so angry-He was being an asshole- he- I didn't mean to-Then what've we been doing, we've been fucking around-I-You can't just declare rules, you're not-Did he say what it was about? When he called, what did he say?Are you still mad at me?You seem mad.What does that even mean?...I understand.That doesn't look easy.Let me try-Whoaaaamygod...whoaaa...Guys, do you hear that?What? I can't hear you!Y- yeah-I CAN FLY!No.That's so cool. Doesn't that count as breaking rule #1 though?I haven't had sex since ever.YO.Yeah.I feel stupid now that I was scared to come back.Well, uh, it would appear that a Virgin Mary has appeared in the maple syrup on a young local man's pancake.Fuck you, pig.What's that mean?So what, you wanna do like, a charity? That's lame.I dunno.Name something you're bad at.Say hi for me.Well I don't wanna go home yet. You wanna go into the city?So?You still haven't told her?And it's bad, because her pain gets real bad, you know, and we can't afford the good meds anymore. When I was little it wasn't as bad, but even then dad was still, you know, the way he is. I don't know. I don't know anymore. I don't know how to feel. CUT.I hope so.No, I- I mean, no, that's not- I'm really shy, and I don't have any talents, or-...Oh, no way. No way-Yeah, Steve chose my clothes, he's gonna do my hair.Oh yeah, me too.I don't know what you mean-Matt....I'm sorry, I'll try to-You really think so-Yeah, it did- it did feel like that. All the girls screaming-What's that?What's \"hubris?\"What \"seriously,\" fuck you seriously!Hey Matt. What's \"seriously\" mean?Yeah, well, we spend a lot of time practicing-What?Oooh, oh yeah, your hair was different; it was blue, right?Monica, yeah-Mom, it's going to be okay, okay? Just try to get through, it's going to be okay.What'd you...You- what'd you see?I didn't spend any of your money, RICHARD-School doesn't cost any money, I go to public school you idiot-You asshole, you fucking crazy asshole-Where's Matt?Where's Matt?No!I'm filming the storm, no one's ever filmed a storm like this up close bef-...My dad-You don't give a shit, stop acting like you care!...What?I'm an idiot. I'm sorry Steve, oh god, I'm sorry-Yeah, yes, I don't know what I'm doing-I've been busy....No.I was upset.I don't know-I don't know-I don't.I'm not lying, I don't know what happened-No, why--wanted to show you what I was talking about.See, it's- I put a little sheet between myself and the knife, and the barrier, the sheet, is too strong. The knife can't cut it. I mean like, what I'm saying is if I concentrate, I can't be hurt. I can't be injured. Because of the little sheet.Hey Wayne!See, this one, I got clean, cause I did a little lasso around the root, but these two, they're broken cause I think I pulled them from the middle. Matt was always better at the little, the intricate stuff, he got good at that. See how broken it is, ugh, sloppy.No, I'm filming this. I film everything.What did you want to talk about?It's not doable. Financially, they're not- I mean, my dad didn't go to college either.I don't need college, Mr. Fernandez.I've been doing a lot of reading, like you know, online, about evolution, and the way it works, and you know, natural selection. The uh... The strongest animals will always survive, and they're the ones that you know, will prosper, or grow, and survive, by feeding on the smaller animals. And as humans we- see, there's...uh- There's this thing called an Apex Predator, and basically what that is the most powerful predator in an ecosystem. And humans, you know, we're the apex predator, because there's nothing that preys on us, cause of weapons and stuff. But if something could, I bet it would.That's rude.Why? Your life's great-You don't need to worry about me. I'm stronger than ever now. I can lift a whole car by myself. I could fucking crush this entire house, I'm fine.So what?I think you should go. I have to pick up my mom's medication.You'd have to what. You were always the weakest. You couldn't do shit to me.I'm not gonna break your stupid fucking rules, just fuck off and stay out of my life.I'm here to pick up a prescription for Sandra Detmer.That's right.I have to come back.Bang.WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!? The windshield is TORN OUT, and seconds later MATT IS RIPPED OUT OF THE CAR AS THOUGH YANKED BY A GIANT HOOK, taking his seatbelt with him.No one's gonna help me...No one's gonna help me now...What type of camera is that?", "clean_line": "want getting ready school drunk seven thirty drunk dad crazy filming bought camera filming shit mom hi camera millions people watching home look great oh yeah definitely oh yeah thanks filming things filming mom trying custody dad getting worse helping way case goes right evidence yeah add context school yeah right coming going miss period okay okay school guess hallway yeah bryce gimme camera hey bryce come oh come eat lunch bleachers hey wasn videotaping okay yes thought haven hills closed telling nah like parties ll think yeah purpose uploading shot today know sure sure looks closed oh yeah supposed thought said want oh filming wasn filming specific filming party okay okay andrew know everybody knows look think supposed oh hm know guys way matt remember gonna rich president idea matt supposed guys guys like push like like whispering singing know probably mean kinda loud right mean won th hey wait hello deeper think like wind think said ghosts steve ahead know talking talk making nervous wanna film messing camera guys maybe maybe shouldn hear know rolling yeah ah shit trick pretend like plate plate wrap plate want yeah plate easier try imagine squeezing entire piece hand andrew points lego set flies mistress told thing right maybe want barrier dad actually fireman know got injured like years ago pay like insurance mean goes day know drinks lot repair stuff actually lot money mom spinal meningitis work insurance cover medicine lot money figure camera maybe dunno custody yeah intense haha course way ew couldn metaphor muscle human body like working think time took backyard matt steve look confused got got teddy bears suddenly comes life waving little boy little boy wowed teddy bear suddenly takes flies air stifled laughter umm got hey matt like asshole know hadn invited party ve happened thanks yeah chicks showed sure need focus matt lucky got kleenex stuck taco bell wrapper face face head camera camera abracadabra mean guys calm sorry okay mean mad okay cops calling cops guys angry asshole mean ve ve fucking declare rules called mad mad mean understand look easy let try whoaaaamygod whoaaa guys hear hear yeah fly cool count breaking rule haven sex yo yeah feel stupid scared come uh appear virgin mary appeared maple syrup young local man pancake fuck pig mean wanna like charity lame dunno bad hi wanna home wanna city haven told bad pain gets real bad know afford good meds anymore little wasn bad dad know way know know anymore know feel cut hope mean shy talents oh way way yeah steve chose clothes gonna hair oh yeah know mean matt sorry ll try think yeah feel like girls screaming hubris seriously fuck seriously hey matt seriously mean yeah spend lot time practicing oooh oh yeah hair different blue right monica yeah mom going okay okay try going okay spend money richard school cost money public school idiot asshole fucking crazy asshole matt matt filming storm filmed storm like close bef dad shit stop acting like care idiot sorry steve oh god sorry yeah yes know ve busy upset know know lying know happened wanted talking little sheet knife barrier sheet strong knife cut mean like saying concentrate hurt injured little sheet hey wayne got clean cause little lasso root broken cause think pulled middle matt better little intricate stuff got good broken ugh sloppy filming film want talk doable financially mean dad college need college mr fernandez ve lot reading like know online evolution way works know natural selection uh strongest animals survive ones know prosper grow survive feeding smaller animals humans uh thing called apex predator basically powerful predator ecosystem humans know apex predator preys cause weapons stuff bet rude life great need worry stronger lift car fucking crush entire house fine think pick mom medication weakest couldn shit gonna break stupid fucking rules fuck stay life pick prescription sandra detmer right come bang windshield torn seconds later matt ripped car yanked giant hook taking seatbelt gonna help gonna help type camera"}, "MATT": {"raw_line": "I got you egg salad.So...Should I ask about the camera, or-You're filming everything.He gets violent or whatever-Evidence.

Don't...shit.-shouldn't have come in here.At first I thought this was a solutional cave, but now...I dunno, it's like a lava tube, or something.Look at the walls. Look at how smooth they are. It's just straight shot down, I mean, we must've already gone forty or fifty feet-You ever hear of Plato's allegory of the cave?Nevermind.Is that, is that showing up on the camera?-changes color, see?

Listen, with this, we can't fuck around, ever.NOT LIKE THAT, ANDREW. That's- you can't use it on people, or hurt people like- Steve, help me out.We need rules, okay.

I'm never gonna get out of this piece of shit town. You know, we're all just little pieces. One person can't really make a difference. I used to think- I don't know.

Detmer-Garrety extended family for liffffeeeeee. But listen when did I become the one who's...who's out alone filming myself, with the camera-Just a thing, it's nothing like- you know, Eye Of The Storm or anything-I- yeah, a lot of people do. I've actually been stalking you since like, sophomore year- sorry, use of the word stalking-Yeah, I- YES- yeah, just gotta drop off the cam-What are you doing? Filming graves, I don't get it.You're not returning my calls, why aren't you returning my calls.No you haven't. Why aren't you returning my calls. Turn off the camera.Turn off the camera.I had a missed call from you, that morning. And from Steve. I listened to your voicemail. No voicemail from Steve.How do you get struck by lightning during a storm with no recorded lightning strikes? You can look that up online, you know, they keep track of it. I looked it up. Zero. And they find him out in a field, why would Steve go out in the middle of a field during a lightning storm?What?No, no, you do know, you do know, I think you do know.What happened, Andrew. Just stop, stop lying to me, and tell me-I don't believe you, okay! I don't believe you, I want you to- put the fucking camera down.Because I want to talk to you. Put it down- put it down, Andrew, please- put it down, turn it off, put the fucking-What did you do, Andrew? What am I supposed to do? Who am I supposed to tell, about this, man? Who do I tell? I mean- I don't, I don't know how I'm supposed to- Why won't you just tell me what happened?I told you how the interviews went.UCONN not so good, Columbia was good, University of Miami was really good, Arizona State was okay.Haha, no, I told you they wouldn't.Nope. Nobody. I flew myself. I needed the exercise.I am so sick of being filmed, you have no idea, Casey-When do your parents get back from Spain?Okay, if you don't film me for one week-One week, I'll show you my new trick.

I'm looking for somewhere to sleep, or something, and I see earth, and I go down to earth. And then...I don't know, just the main part is that I'm out and there are the stars and they just look like millions of little points of light...And Steve is there.Yeah but he feels like he's not part of it. Like he's there separately, inside my head. Andrew is there too. I don't know. I'm worried about Andrew. Why don't you put the camera away?Oh I think you know. I think you know what's going down.You arrrrreeee...C'mere.You haven't been returning my calls, so I thought I'd just...you know, ambush.I just- I've been getting, you know, bad vibes or whatever.I know you stopped coming to school, and my mom said you guys are having a lot of problems with money. I'm worried about you.Dude, don't be like that, okay-That doesn't- that actually sounds like the opposite of fine.

You're my friend- it's my responsibility to take care of you....Are you going to break the rules? We're too strong now, Andrew. We're too strong for that. If you did that, you know I'd have to-...Andrew-Do you hear that, how can you not hear that?The singing, how can you not hear that!?

It's not a cave, it's like a tunnel- do you hear how loud that's getting?Come on, man. Come on.Huh. I dunno. I don't believe in ghosts.Can you believe this, this is NUTS-Touch one!Make it change again! This is awesome!AGHHHHH!I'm sorry, oh shit, I'm sorry-Go.`In the- penis- the penis-Mhm.Guys, check it out.Ha! Shit, shit-Guys, listen, listen. Samantha.What would you suggest, as like, a course of action for me, here?-new camera's working out for you, that's good. CUT.I have to admit, though, I don't understand the filming thing.You don't feel like it's a little weird? Like it puts a barrier between you and everything?Okay. I respect that.So how do you pay for your shit?What about your mom.I've actually been having some problems with my parents, too.Nothing like yours, though. Not- Never mind.They've just been fighting a lot. I think my mom is cheating on my dad.Yeah. I know. I'm actually, yeah, I'm sure my mom is cheating on my dad.I just, you know, I saw some stuff. It's weird, you don't think about your parents as like...people, or whatever. I don't know.Don't tell anybody about that-Good.Yeah, I was doing weights, too.Free-weights, a barbell. I got up to two hundred pounds before I bled.No, I like braingina. Braingina is the shiiiiit.If anyone criticizes you, just call them a hater. It's like calling someone a racist, they'll just drop whatever they're complaining about and be like \"I'M NOT A HATER.\" Nobody wants to be a hater.Just stay back a little ways, yeah-That girl, with the cart.Oh my god Andrew, look-GUYS, WHY ARE WE RUNNING!? We don't need to run, we don't need to run!I just always feel like I miss stuff.What? Shut up.Got it, got it.Yeah, you got some from your ears, too. You've gotta start working it out more, Matt.Guys, guys. Look.Ignore us!That was fucking great. I mean, this just gives me so many ideas, already, stuff we could do-He's like right on your bumper, too.He's just some asshole redneck, look at him. He's fucking with us....I...what...Is he still in there? If he's in there we have to get him out-Fuck that, take your fucking camera.Hey kids.Just try it, it's easy.You throw yourself at the ground. You just fall, and catch yourself, and then it's easy, I swear. Don't try to jump or you'll flip yourself. CUT.Hey Matt, you're finally good at something!I said you're an idiot!I can't hear a damn thing you're saying!WOO! HOLY FUCKING FUCK! I COULDA DIED, MAN! I ALMOST FUCKING DIED!You saved my life, dude! Andrew, you saved my fucking life! Is that- Holy shit is that the camera?! YouFUCKIN' AMAZING!Ahhhhh!This is what people have wanted forever, since like caveman times! Do you understand, I mean do you- jesus christ, I can't even- Everything is fucking great! I CAN FLY! Matt, listen, just say it!Shout it out man!FUCK. YES.Well, I mean, she notices that it's gotten better, definitely. You just have to be subtle.Pfff, technicalities.Ugh, man, you guys...how are you so cool?Yeah.Unanimous. Yes.Well that answers that.I'm live on scene here with Matt and Andrew, boys, can you tell us what's happening?That is, that is some very uh, definitely supernatural shit, going on there.Oh, no shit?Why is that lame?AAH! DOUCHEBAG!I'm not good at everything-I'm not GOOD at everything, I just do my best at everything. That's what it's about. I mean you talk about philosophy and shit all the time, but you never really do anything. Have you even applied to colleges yet?You could use some of that, man, I'm just saying.You lack initiative.Later dude.What're you doing, where are you going now?Ah, dude, it's rush hour.Hell yeah, dude.I wish I could bring Samantha up here. She'd love this.Nah, no way. She'd freak out.Mom's like, never home anymore. I mean, you saw how my dad is, he's just quiet. Sits around. I don't know. And talking to him about it is just pointless. He's got nothing to say.It'll be fine, dude. You'll figure it out.Hey, I wanted to ask you, winter break's coming up...You wanna do the talent show with me? Get you out there, you know, meet some new people.Yes you do, you have a talent, you have a talent.Matt, you have the camera yeah? You have the camera, cause, don't let him forget the camera, okay? That's Andrew's camera.HEY! HEY ASSHOLE!We have to get down from here right now, Andrew! This isn't safe!Hung over, dude! You should be too! Let's just-What the fuck are you doing?No, we're getting the fuck down, now. This is fucking crazy, Andrew- what- what happened to your face?Your dad fucking beat the shit out you! Come on, we'll go to the cops, let's get out of here. He can't do that Andrew.This is not the way you handle it, we'll go together, let's go, he can't do that-I don't fucking care!? You're my best friend, idiot!I hang out with you and Matt practically every fucking day! You think I talk to anyone else about my parents, or my feelings on shit, are you that fucking insecure?Dude, it's okay. You just need help, okay?It'll be fine. But we've- ...Do you hear that?
