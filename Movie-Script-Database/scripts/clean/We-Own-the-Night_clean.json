You gotta behave yourself here!Well now you're gonna do nothing someplace else! Now listen--one of these days I'm gonna run this whole block, and I see any you in here again--any you-- I'll bust your fuckin' hole! Throw `em out on their ass. I gotta go upstairs, drop off my keys with the old man.Mr. Buzhayev, how are you!Listen, Mr. Buzhayev--I gotta go do something right now. But don't worry--everything's in good shape downstairs.You remember what I tol' you?Nobody knows about my father and my brother--not even Jumbo. And it's gotta stay that way, you understand?Nah. Nah, I'm managing now.Yeah. I'll see you `round, arright?I changed my name--I use my mother's name now. It's better for business. C'mon...That's them there. In the corner. Lookit `em--two peas in a pod.[My] Father's friends--they were all in Korea together. Biggest bunch of fuckin' stiffs... Look, don't talk to nobody, we'll get out quicker.N--I just wanna get out quick, that's all...Yeah I did so...congratulations...Pop. Everybody, this is my girlfriend. Rosario.This's my brother. And my father.I know. I like it this way. That why you got me up here? [To] tell me my hair's too long?Whatsamatter?That's a good hook for you.You ever talk?A favor? Oh, he needs a favor!You cut me off financially, and now you need the favor? `S interesting.`S good lookin' boy!I don't know nothing about that.The old man?! What, you been watching us?!?What the fuck is this?You kidding me? Inform for you?!? That's what you wanted me here for?Yeah well, find another way. I got a lot invested in that club and I can't let it get fucked up.[You] Fuckin' broadsided me... Everything's about the goddamned job with you.C'mon... Get off your fuckin' high horse and bust somebody else's balls.You're welcome.'S that supposed to mean?!?Congratulations. You got me up here.Good. Then now you know.Yeah. I like the dark meat.Why, you want some?I gotta go, Pop. I'll see you `round.C'mon, let's get outta here, [we'll] go party with Jumbo.We're goin'. C'mon.You're just like her, baby...That's cool.It's all right--they don't like nobody outside their own little world.My brother and my father ain't like that. It's just--the whole thing ain't for me, that's all.You know how gorgeous you are?What is it?...it's beautiful......you're so good to me...Only if you behave yourself...Uh oh--[The] party's really gonna get started now!Any Spanish Fly in there for you?I'm goin' up to see Buzhayev tonight. I think he's gonna ask me to buy into the club.I'll show you a fuckin' faggot!Everybody, I gotta be at El Caribe in an hour, so get ready!No no, I'm all right... Hi everybody...Everything's really rockin' tonight. Line's halfway `round the block.You wanted to talk to me?'S a good move.I appreciate that. You know, I been thinking `bout it--I'd like to become a partner here too--buy in with you. I mean, I got a lot of ideas.Well, I just think we could do more. Maybe expand into Sheepshead Bay. I know a good spot--we add a restaurant there, get the spill- over. Like what your brother did, in Miami.I can understand that. But I got money to invest--we could make it something real special over there. Do what I did downstairs--you know, bring in name DJs on different nights? What do you think?Yeah, sure. I'll come.Nah nah, no thank you...Listen--I get this done, I want you to be a host. In one of our spots.Well, just make sure you get your old co-workers from the Health Department to give us a pass on the kitchen.Where's Rosario?Goddamnit... [She's] With that fuckin' animal again.Look at him... I'll tell you, [when] this is my place, we'll kick his fuckin' ass right outta here--Yeah, you know a lot.You sure it wasn't your dick?Shit... I'll be right back.Things're goin' good.He don't look like a middleweight no more.Your uncle's a great man. Smart man.Your uncle loses his license, he ain't gonna be too happy.Yeah...I'll think about that. Rosario--I wanna talk to you.You gotta stop dealing. You hear what I'm telling you?You hear what I said?Just hold off then, for a little while. Okay? I got my reasons.Gimme your shit!Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.Okay, I'll go thank him too then. He comes in, raids the fuckin' place--now I gotta go beg `em not to fire me--Fuck you, Pop. Fuck the both of you's.You fuckin' touch me!? You gonna fuckin' touch me?!?Mr. Buzhayev... I'm real sorry about what happened the other night. [If] I was working, maybe I would've been able to do something, but... Anyway, I'm sorry.You don't mind my saying, I think that's probably the right thing to do. Things get back to normal, I'm hoping we could get started on what we talked about.Mr. Buzhayev, my getting arrested ain't gonna be a problem. I don't got a record--Yeah... All right...You had to hit that spot.I had plans down there.You got real balls saying that to me. I made something for myself, and you come in and fuck it up? Just `cause I'm not trying to be like you? And Pop--What did you call her?You piece of shit...Fine with me, you motherfucker!That ain't nothing.We'll see you and bump you two C's.Siegfried and Roy, baby! Two fucking queens!Who is it?Hello?Is--is he gonna be all right?My brother was shot...they're operating on him now.Game's over, everybody.That's right. I gotta go.What're you doing?No--it's gonna be a fuckin' scene. I'll call you later.Don't argue.Louis, lock up and take her home.Yeah, no--I just remembered I gotta do something, that's all--Pop?Pop, he all right?I need to see him...You guys blaming me for this? Is that it?That's bullshit--she's clean. You fuckin' keep away from her.Yeah. That's me.Look--I'm his brother, you fuckin' hard-on!...Feels like it was my fault...Hercules, do me a favor--before you kill a waitress, go pay the check.Don't tell Louis nothing about what happened. Far as he knows, my family moved away, [a] long time ago.I didn't have nothing on me.Your uncle's got some problems now, though.Baby--why don't you go keep Jumbo company, make sure he leaves a tip.It's a little dangerous right now, don't you think?Muscle--?A cop got hit today. They ain't never gonna sit still for that.I'll see you around...I need to find Deputy Chief Grusinsky.Pop, I gotta talk to you.It's important--I got information.It's about you.It's bad.Yeah...Pop, Nezhinski's been talkin' about a shipment he's got comin'. Maybe that's how you get to him.They been wanting me to buy in for a while.What do you mean, set something up?Pop?You could trust her.But...but you could get killed--Your mother's real important to you, ain't she. You'd do anything for her.Go back to sleep...You been up to see my brother...?...How's that been goin'...?Well I... I been thinking...if you could keep it confidential...? I'd make the connection for you.They trust me--we could go in large, use my money for the buy, they won't suspect anything--He don't gotta know anything about it. Does he?I know. It's just--I realized... ....my father dies `cause of all this, I couldn't live my life knowing I coulda done something. I know the same is true for you. I know it is.So please--can we do this...?Hey. It's Bobby Green. I decided--I wanna buy in.Fifty k, to start.Sounds good.Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.Most expensive phone call I ever made.You need to promise me something, though. You won't investigate my girlfriend--she's, she don't know any better.I'll take care of it.You gonna leave me all alone out there?You come up with that one all by yourself?I--I need to talk to you.I--I'm gonna inform. For the police. I'm gonna help `em set up Nezhinski.I had to do it, Rosario. These motherfuckers--they were gonna come after my father.He ain't ever gonna find out. He ain't ever gonna know.I don't know... I'd, I'd probably have to go into protection.But that's never gonna happen!Rosario, listen--I had to do it.I had to do it...Everything's gonna be all right... Don't worry, it'll be all right...Yeah... Sorry, buddy--I got some legal shit to deal with, from the raid... But I ain't forgot about you--I'll be back soon.No, it's okay--I'll talk to him later...Where's Vadim.Well, I got fifty grand in here. And it don't move `less I deal with the man himself. So [if] you're interested, I wanna see your stash, right now. No bullshit.You know me.That's all the money I got. And I ain't gonna leave it alone.From my savings. From El Caribe and Rasputin.Sounds good.I took a little taste.I'm clean.You wanna search me again, you go `head. I just wanna make this deal and go home.I'm gonna get pussy from this...[When] this deal goes down, I'm, I'm gonna get a lotta pussy...I'm with you! I'm with YOU!I'll be all right, Pop.I need you to get my girlfriend, Pop. I need her to come with me.Yeah. They let me come--long as I brought these guys with me.Good... It's rehabbing good, for only nine weeks. Don't matter, I wasn't no Fred Astaire before.Anyway, it ain't nothing compared to my brother, so...Just hold on, `til he gets here.I'm not sure yet... We been thinking about moving down to Miami. Guy I used to work for, his brother's got a place down there.A lotta kids here, lotta family... It's nice, ain't it...?You know how happy I am you're with me?I'm real glad you're home...What're you talking about? They got a lot of food over there--why don't you go eat something?You fucked up?We gotta straighten this out later.That don't mean nothing.There's a whole network full of suppliers. The organization goes deep.I'll be outside if you need me.Well, why's he goin' back to work so soon, anyway? He ain't ready.POP--No, come on! I don't want that! What I did, I did for you guys, this once. I got my own plans.Take me back to the motel.Rosario? Rosario!WHERE THE FUCK IS SHE?!?The cops're right outside--let's go. I said, let's go!Lou--no more of this for her. It's too fuckin' dangerous now.Yeah--we'll talk later, buddy--I'll call you. But right now I need to get her outta here.You gotta put everything in jeopardy? Huh?You know, I don't think you realize how serious this is?We gotta ride this out, `til this fuckin' thing is over. `Til I can get things back on track.I know. But I'm workin' on it, I am. Soon as the trial's over and I get my money back outta impound-- everything'll get better, you'll see.Rosario--once this's done, we'll go down to Miami... [It'll] be a new thing for us--a lotta opportunities... I'll talk to Mr. Buzhayev about working for his brother down there. We'll get your mother to come too-- I'll even talk to Jumbo about it.C'mon... Let's go back--this'll all be over soon. I promise...Thank you... You know Mr. Buzhayev, I come to see you today `cause...with everything that's gone on, I don't think it's a good idea for me to stay in New York anymore. I was hoping maybe you could ask your brother if I could work with him, down in Miami. On his restaurant.I'd appreciate it.You always been very important to me too. I should probably go now.Yeah, maybe. Why don't we give `em all these bags to throw out--it's becoming a mess.What's goin' on?What--?Jesus... What about--You see something out there?Pop? Joe come close this morning?Yeah, maybe. But you know the way he is.I know, Pop.It's really coming down...Hey--Vitt--I think somethin's on our right!Get down!Rosario! You hurt?Pop, lay back!Don't fuckin' look at him! I said don't--back up! Don't look at him...Does my brother know yet?Then you gotta take me to him... I wanna go see him...Joseph?I don't know if I can do that. II wanna stay close to you from now on, Joe... I wanna stay with you...You gonna fuckin' catch these guys?You ain't got nothing, do you.You gotta find that spot...Course...No.... I did it to hurt him... I disappointed him...I can't live like this no more, Mike... They destroyed my family. There's a deal going down, I... I wanna help...I, I could join you.My Pop tol' me you pull guys outta the Academy, guys with special knowledge, [and] make `em cops? You could do that.No. I can't do nothing else now.I know.Joe, I'm gonna join you. I just decided... Okay?This is where I belong...I wanna talk to you about something.I'm thinking of...maybe joining the Force.I mean, I help find Nezhinski, we don't gotta live like this the rest of our lives--moving every three fuckin' days...What're you talking about? I just got through telling you--(struggling to stayHold on a second--I know what I'm talking about'd be a change. It'd be a big change for us.But we could make a life here. This'd be something we could build on. We could raise a family, and...Pretty soon you'd fit in.They'll accept you if we're TOGETHER--Gave it up? Gave up what?What fuckin' life did you have? You're a fuckin' cokehead--look at you!Well, maybe I was a piece of shit too! Wasting my goddamned time!Wake up! All that was nothing!My brother's gonna be all right-- and nothing's gonna happen to me.Hey--where you goin'--What the fuck you doin'?All right. Why don't you just calm down and think about it a little.You think about it, you'll feel different. You'll understand. And in time, we'll look back on all this and you'll see I was right. Look--I love you. Why don't you go get some rest?Thank you, sir.

I mean, I come on to help you--I know. But you don't gotta do everything yourself. That's what I'm trying to tell you.Joe, what's wrong? Come on, you can tell me. A deal this big, something's gonna come up. You'll see--someone'll fold.Nah, you didn't do nothing. It's meant to be. You can't fuckin' control it...Tell her I'm on my way back now. Don't worry.That's all in the past. I'll see you later.What happened--where'd she go?!?We gotta go find her!DON'T--FUCKIN'--Go `head! Keep me in here--KEEP ME HERE!You gonna keep me here? HUH?!?It's me, Lou.I'm okay. Listen uh, you ain't spoke to Rosario lately, have you?Yeah--it's just, she must've gone out for a little bit and...I wanted to get in touch with her.Thanks...

We gotta see this through ourselves...All right, c'mon. Enough...We're gonna get all of `em today.Lookit the two of them...they're so fuckin' close...You're surrounded by the police!

C'mon, don't be a first-class schmuck!Then we make the time! Look, I want you all to understand something--we don't ever play in the dirt here, okay? Not ever, no matter what! You piss in your pants, you only stay warm for so long.Bunch of college boys from Kansas. We protect our own here.Forget it, both of you.BOBBY--That's too dangerous for him! We don't know how solid his cover is out there! That girlfriend of yours, she knows about you, right? So can we just get back to the discussion please?What?Good. I'm glad. But it's not happening. So forget it.Don't worry about me, just worry about yourself, arright? Anything happens with your brother I'll call you. Goodbye.Goodbye!Where's my goddamned kid?!?Jesus.You guys go on a bust like this and you don't tell me about it? You think I'm born yesterday?You're a real comedian! He's gonna need to be in protection now!Well, I guess I don't have a say in anything anymore. Anyway... You did it. You did it and it took real balls. But now you're burnt--and we gotta get you someplace safe, keep you under wraps for awhile.I'll get them to take care of that. Just go get yourself fixed up-- that's the most important thing.Joseph--we got some things we need to discuss, when you get the chance.Bobby--you should hear this too, for the trial.We're gonna try and turn him, get him to tell us how they're bringing it in. But don't worry--we'll make sure he does plenty of time.Well, you marry an ape, you don't complain about the stench of bananas.What's that, Bobby?I asked him to come in, Joe. If he's gonna have to testify, he should know all this.No--it's better this way. I don't want him sitting around with nothing to do, feeling useless--Hey, c'mere. A lotta people been talking. About how good you did. And I think maybe...considering the alternatives... ...maybe you might wanna think about joining the Department.I could pull some strings, get you through the academy with an early LEAVE--Wait--Don't go yet--Can't you put some clothes on him?Hello? What's the matter? Huh?Jesus! Listen to me--you and Jack get someplace safe. Let ESU take care of it--I'm gonna go get your brother.Nezhinski's out.Your brother was taking him to the A.D.A. and they got ambushed. They hit three of our guys.Your brother's fine. We gotta get you moved--you've been here too long.You need to pack up.Nah, we're good. It's just, I just realized--I know this neighborhood. I used to come with my father, to work on the plumbing, for the houses--brought me along to do the talking. He only spoke Russian his whole life... Anyway, it's all changed now.Arright...I don't know... I heard he did good, though. You know, with everything that's happened--who knows? Maybe all this'll bring us closer together someday.Once this is over, you and your brother, you'll talk, you'll work things out.Bobby--your brother, I think he probably feels a little guilty, with everything you did, with you in protection now... But he appreciates what you've done--I know he does.Look, I'm just trying to keep us together here, that's all. That's all I want.Okay... We'll move `em to Corona.

What're you doin'?!?He ain't gonna come.How you doing...Feels like nothin'. Nah, it feels good! I love trying to, you know, help make the City safer for people and everything...Bobby, hey! You, you got off work and everything--Bobby, I asked Pop to bring you here.Well... I'm gonna be heading up a new narcotics team, starting this week. A Russian unit, outta PSA 2 in Brighton.Yeah, they need me over there. There's only eleven guys in the whole department that even know the language right now, so...Bobby, we need you to do us a favor.PUDGE--We're looking at this guy Vadim Nezhinski.Served time in the Soviet Union for black market activity, come over around 1979.He's dealing H, cocaine, angel dust... Operates out of that club you manage. The El Caribe.No, we know that. We checked up and down the rest of management, too--his uncle, the owner--Everybody come up clean. It's just Nezhinski we're lookin' at.We need to track how he's bringin' in the product and...we were just hopin' you'd keep your eyes and ears open a little.No, we would never ask you to do that. Just observe, that's all. It's a closed community and you're our only way in right now--Nothing's gonna get fucked up, Bobby. All it takes is one thing, you know that! One guy to flip, we crack the whole thing!Whole city's falling apart, Bobby-- don't you got any sense of responsibility at all?Thanks for coming.Just be careful out there next coupla weeks.Thank you everybody for coming-- happy Thanksgiving. Before I say anything else... We got some bad news this morning.One of our Irish brothers was killed in the line of duty last night--detective Edward Conlon was gunned down serving a warrant on Northern Boulevard. The clock's about to strike ten, so I thought we might give a moment of silence to remember.Good. I just wanna make sure we take it easy in there. We don't want no panic.It's his day off. He ain't gonna be there.Everybody! Get your hands on your head and don't fuckin' move! Turn off that music. Right now!Give everybody a toss. G.Q.--Too much pizza, right there.Turn around... Turn around!What is this? Want me to double your money? Huh?Okay. It's doubled now, how's that.You got a cross AND a Jewish star on you?What's the star for?Okay, let's go. You. And you-- You're under arrest, possession and sale of narcotics--Your boy's gonna turn. And then we'll come back for you.He stabbed himself, he was a bundle guy. Mighta known how they're movin' it. See, that's the key--We waited `til it was your day off. We had to go--I'm sorry.Nezhinski was seen there, Bobby! What am I supposed to do--announce it in advance, compromise the whole thing? C'mon.Yeah, well, I tried. What do you want from me, anyway? You know, you're standing there feeling sorry for yourself, but you wouldn't be in this shit if you didn't fuck around in the first place.Bobby, you're the one acting like you're above it all all the time!Fuckin' around with your little Puerto Rican all day--You heard me. Have some fucking class for once.[You] go around like you're a big shot... You're a joke! Grow up already! Fuckin' loser...You come at me like that...? Don't come around me no more--I don't wanna have to look at your fuckin' face ever again.Do me a favor, don't get involved. We'll pick this up tomorrow. I'm gonna go home.Hello?Hello...?Only when I look at you!Hey, Bobby...We could do it now if you want, Pop. In the den.He ain't gonna be reliable, Pop.Where is he?I wanna go with you on that. See his fuckin' face.That's `cause we got their number one. Dried it up at the source.Bobby--you done a lot for us already. You don't gotta get involved in this anymore. Okay?This's police business, Pop--you gonna make him an honorary member of the Force now?I'll go in the lead car. You stay with him `til we get to the A.D.A.'s.He makes a deal today, maybe my brother don't gotta take the stand... Least that's something...Stop the fuckin' car!...I'll catch `em, Bobby. Don't worry...They're gonna need us to identify the body...That's right...MIKE--I'll be ready to come back and head it up. I'll be ready and, and we'll get `em. After the funeral.Bobby... I'm real glad you're with me now...You know, I was...I was jealous of you, [for a] long time....I always did what Pop wanted. And you were free......It's all right... I'll be all right...What about Nezhinski's uncle? That clubowner--Marat Buzhayev?It's comin' up quick, we don't know anything... We're gonna lose it...I know that. And my family takes the hit--my family...We don't got much time...we lose Nezhinski, we're both dead... [The] streets'll get flooded, the whole City's gonna be on fire--Well, I didn't ask you to do that. I don't need your help--I could deal with it on my own.It's not that. It's just... You give up what you wanted to do to be here, Bobby. And part of me feels a little responsible.You know, I remember when Pop was mad at you, he always used to say you didn't believe in our family. And Mom, she'd protect you. She'd give you those little caramels... Anyway, I knew he was wrong too, but I didn't say nothing.Yeah, definitely... We'll get the TAC plan together... And wherever it is, we'll be ready for `em...Yeah?The deal's closing--let's go!You know, I think Pop would be real happy to see you like this.Ah, the Force'll treat you good. I'm sure you do very well.It's the right thing. It's over for me--I'm out.Arright, yeah.
