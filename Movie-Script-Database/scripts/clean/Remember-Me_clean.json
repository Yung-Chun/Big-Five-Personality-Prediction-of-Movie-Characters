{"Remember-Me": {"TYLER": {"raw_line": "Yeah... Of course. I'm on my way. I know...I know...I know...I know.Hello, your majesty. How are you?Thanks for organizing everybody.Could have.Why no, Caroline. What did your art teacher say about your portrait?Young Whistler... good... 'cause Whistler really fell off late in his career. He's the Michael Jackson of European art history.Are you really this clueless? Are you really dismissing her like this?What was the subject?The subject we were discussing. What was it?No. It's the perfect time.Do you need me to take you anywhere?Then I'll see you after school.Yes, ma'am.You sold my who? ...What?...Congratulations?I was unaware we had a previous business venture.And you think women would buy this? With money?Of course. Yes.I'm down with getting you on some sort of medication.Or Denny's. Denny's was big in the 19th century.I know.You think that would be the worst part about having emphysema?Dad loves you.You've got that right.That's because Aunt Sara drinks... You don't drink, right?So why would anyone wanna avoid you?Yeah. He did. But Michael was 21. All 21 year olds drink because it's new and exciting. Aunt Sara drinks because she wishes she was 21.I think I'd rather be sodomized.I don't expect you to appreciate this, but the schematic for this particular shelf is authors who were sleeping together...And ended up dead or in prison.Eh.Hey!You realize interventions typically discourage binge drinking?When's the last time you had one drink?No no. Girls are like that when they're way into you.She's all over you. Cheers.You ever actually been to any of those places?It wasn't them.Hey!They didn't do anything. They didn't start this. Those assholes did. Why do these guys have to go downtown?This is bullshit. It was those gorillas who started this.You're a police officer. You're supposed to.How about you do your job?I'm good.That was a messed up situation. Those guys......Are pussies!There was no justice in that situation.Did you just say \"nihilistic\"?So what's with the ash tray?Tease.Nice to see you too.Okay.I came to see how much it costs, because I'm giving you the money back.That lawyer.Christ.I wanted to make sure you understood it wasn't me who called you.I don't want to be bailed out of anything.I'll get an invoice from Janine.Hey.Excuse us, we're due in surgery.Horrible threshing accident.Don't mock the afflicted. Here, I brought you something.This was my favorite book ever. Michael had it and he hit me over the head with it until I read it. Its about all these God and Goddesses who spend all of their time being jealous and petty and otherwise acting like human beings. The illustrations are amazing.Guggenheim. What's up with those girls?When you're drawing?Je m'appelle \"Freak of Nature.\"Mon dieu, mon soeurette! Je m'appelle \"Freak of Nature\". Sacre Bleu. French Toast.I finally found something I'm good at?Who?Revenge. What do you want me to do, kidnap her?What does that mean?You should be incarcerated on general principle.I don't want to get that asshole.I don't want to meet her.I don't care.I'm not meeting her.This is one of those moments I'm already regretting.What am I supposed to say to this girl? \"Hey doll face, your dad trampled all over my civil liberties, wanna make out?\"I know her. I mean, I don't know her, but, I've seen her. She's in my global politics class.Excuse me?My name's Tyler Roth. I was wondering if I could bother you for a minute?Um, I'm doing kind of a sociological experiment...I was hoping you could help me out.No, I... may I ask your name?Okay, Anonymous, do you see the guy across the room, pretending to read a text book, looking in this general direction?I have this theory that an objective third-party, having no prior contact, would be able to determine how much of an asshole he is just by looking at him.He's my roommate. And I've witnessed so many glaring examples of assaholic behavior that I'm biased as a subject, but I'm convinced that he has an aura, that people can actually perceive. So, just take a good long look. And tell me what you think?No one here. The parameters called only to sample attractive women in their early twenties.In their late teens. Well, look, you typically get something for participating in these things and I've run out of those big foam fingers, so I was thinking maybe I could take you out some night?Or you could just go out with me on the off chance we'd have an interesting conversation.Indeed they are. Lucky for you, I'm undecided.Everything.Hey. It's Tyler.You're going to stand me up. I can feel it in my bones. I'll be devastated.You were just sitting around in your pajamas watching T.V.Eight.Pad Thai and a Sapporo. Thanks.Is this a political statement? A medical condition?Is that probable?But the odds are, I mean...You had a nice time or you're having a nice time?Because if you're having one, why rush to end it?Did I tell you I'm Caucasian?No. If I stop, he wins.No, the frigging Giant Panda.I won.I just paid a premium to cut out the middle man. That's innovation. That's free market enterprising. That's what made America great.Oh, it's nothing, just a bar fight.I know. I'm practically a pirate.You've got some serious timing.I'll walk you to the train.So dessert before dinner for fear of death by rogue asteroid... yes. Kissing guy you're obviously attracted to before driving off into the unknown New York night... no.Happy end of sixth grade!I heard.Don't pretend. I know you're proud. You should be.A thing?Let me check my book. Abso-freaking- lutely. I'm camping out. I'm sleeping there the night before.Good. I'm sure Les was...Yes, it's over. Did Mom and Les get the beach house again?Nothing.No.Like that's possible.I know. But we have coasters.That's Michael. My brother.Not any more.It depends who you ask.They'd say no. I try but it turns out you need talent.Falconry. I come from a long line of falconers.Well there is one thing...Our appetizer.It used to say \"In Case Of Asteroid\" but I took a shower and Aidan got high.I don't actually get grades.I'm not technically enrolled. I worked out an auditing thing.I like the books.You don't have to help me, you know.You make it sound so cheap.I'm sorry. I didn't...Apologize.Apologize.I surrender! Oh my God, you're relentless.Now... I'm furious.Really? Why? Are cigarettes like bad for you or something?It's not really...He killed himself.When he was 21. He had just started working for my father.He was. But he wasn't making a living doing music and my father's a very compelling guy.You're not Irish.Ally, Aidan... Aidan, Ally.One drink?Oh. OK. Sure.Your phone's dead. Just tell me the number and I'll call him...Ally? Ally?You were the one dumping Jello shots down her throat. You almost killed her.Penance. I have to get to work.She's pretty shaken up.We've really got to fix that dead bolt.Don't be. You think she'll sleep?I told her she could stay here... Are you alright with that?You're up.Can I get you anything?I'll be out here if you need me.It's not so far. I can't believe you still get his coffee... three sugars, no milk?Not today.Hey...Downtown.There's a coffee shop. I brought you a Bialy.This one was our place... Michael's and mine. We had breakfast there all the time ... Maybe not as many times as I think we did. But enough times. Anyway we ate there that morning. It was the last place I saw him.Maybe. Sometimes. I don't know. But I guess I wanted to tell him about you.Hey mom.Sit down, Mom. Can I get you something?I wish she'd told me. It was a unilateral Caroline decision. Will you make sausage and peppers?I'll get him there.I'll get him there, mom.Yes.Diane...It's about Caroline's show. Are you planning on attending?Caroline's show.You are coming, right?Dinner? That's not...Let's just skip dinner and I'll tell you how great you look in like eighteen different languages.I was going to make a joke about how I'm not prepared for the commitment of exchanging accessories and how neck wear especially is a slippery slope, but I should probably shut up and say thank you.Have you ever been here?He's allowed to stand me up. But he's not allowed to stand you up. Or my sister.I'll have a whiskey.This is Alicia Craig. Ally, my father, Charles Roth.Dad's a Yankee fan. It has something to do with the payroll.Blind familial allegiance. I didn't know what overpriced, overfed, fat bastards they were.It's a metaphor...Roger Clemens.Why are you saying this now?God.Don't say it.You have somewhere else to be, Dad.I don't believe you.It's not good enough.Ally...?I have something I've got to do.Are you capable of taking care of yourself for an hour? Do you need me here every minute, or what?She drew you a picture.You have a daughter who sincerely believes you don't like her.Don't you at least want to know her? She's telling you something, Dad. She's communicating. Why aren't you riveted? Why isn't this the most important thing? At least for one night of your life?You, Mr. Roth.And...?Maybe not. Maybe Caroline doesn't either. Where would she have learned it?That does not mean you're allowed to shatter it whenever there's something better to do.You didn't find him. I found him. And you're so tragically blind, the rest of your children are going to hang themselves on your watch.Whose was that anyway?What?That is the stupidest thing you've ever said, including that time with the bong in the emergency room.You went to the library?I'll skip this particular bloodbath, thank you.bum buh bum bum buh bum buh bum...What are you doing in my house?She's not here now. She's at the library.No.I'm not going anywhere.I'm the one she came to when you used her face as a punching bag.She needs you.Your dad was here.When I got home.There's more.He knows me. Before I met you. He arrested me and Aidan. He gave me that gash over my eye.I mouthed off to him. He ... responded. Then Aidan saw you guys together at school.Aidan suggested...I...introduced myself to you.Ally...Hey.Don't do that. What are you doing?Yeah.But it doesn't mean anything. I didn't mean to hurt you,She's asleep.Last one ever. I swear.I know you're not here for me but, thank you for being here.For what it's worth, I think you're amazing.I'm sorry.She's sleeping.You okay?I didn't call you.Thank you for bailing me out.Is it working?Hey...Hey.I'll be back in an hour. I have to stop by my dad's office.Whichever tastes better a la mode.If I said I love you... what would you say?I love you too.Are you canceling all together or are you just running late?I'm already here.Take your time.

I sold her a toothbrush. Got three bucks.Are in order, yes. Because that sale inspired our newest business venture: \"The S.L.U.T.\"The 'Single Lady's Universal Tote'. It's the one-night-stand travel pack for women. We throw in some make-up, toiletries, cell phone charger, cab numbers. Retail it at S19.95, maybe do an infomercial.Hey one-night-stands happen... It's a part of life... like stubbing your toe. Sometimes you misjudge a corner and bend back your pinky toe, other times you wake up in a freshman dorm wearing a field hockey tee shirt wondering why your balls smell like cinnamon...Don't underestimate the novelty gift market. Think about it... instead of giving that token slutty friend a ten-inch purple dildo for her birthday, you hook her up with \"The SLUT.\" Everyone has a laugh and the implication that she'll probably use it someday remains. What do you say? Are you down?OK...fine...be cynical...just remember at some point in history two people had a conversation just like this about the light bulb. One of them went on to fame and fortune and the other one probably went to work at Mickey D's or something.What about Atlantic City for your birthday this year? Get a suite. Couple of ladies. You could call Toothbrush Girl, what do you think?Hey, it's your day.What's the point? How do you know where anything is in this place, anyway? There's like...No shit?This is why chicks dig you.Seriously. They like this freaky poetic crap. I ran into Megan yesterday. She's bartending at Don Hill's tonight. She wants us to stop by. She practically begged me.Hey nothing. You've been a ghost the past couple weeks. You never wanna go out. I'm feeling unappreciated here.One drink. Come out for one drink.Hey, Megan!You look great! Can I get two Heinekens?Is she mad at me or something?Oh.Well, hello...My pleasure...Thanks. You've met my roommate...I love this street. I love this city. Where are you guys from, again?Miami.

I got it off a cereal box.Yeah, I called your dad's office. Sue me....I know by every numerical measurement I didn't pass but what I was hoping was that maybe you give me a grade on my trying to pass. My commitment to effort. My commitment to commitment...Since the semester is nearly at it's terminus.I mean... uh... life's only about what we put into it. It's about people. And what they put into it.
