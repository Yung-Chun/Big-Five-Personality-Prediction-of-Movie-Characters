Did you guys invite Grandmother like you said you would?Really?Vicky's here. I gotta go.My mom is a liar. She told me she invited my Grandmother tonight but she didn't.She never even called her.She just tries to keep me away from her. Says she turns into a nutcase this time of year.Pretty much all she talks about. It defines her life. She's been in shock ever since. You should see her house.No. I think people made up the bit about them being related because it made them feel better. Like it couldn't happen to anyone.Go for it.Cameron. Jesus.I'm just thinking about tonight.Be nice. It'll be nice. I just want you to meet them. I'm more old fashioned than they are. Just don't make them like you too much. I like to keep them on edge.I'll see you lovebirds later. And I well see you tonight.You said she was going to come.Did you really have a talk?Dad!Hey! I didn't think you were coming.Mom!No we weren't.What is it?Serious?I get it. You didn't let up about me going and then you back out?Maybe I like doing- I'm not being anti-social. I'm just... reserved.Hey, there's Cameron. I'm gonna catch up with him. You guys go on without me.No. I just thought... It'd be more fun if you'd hang with me. That's all. Cameron is sweet, but I'm still getting used to the idea... I don't know. And his friend...?I'm fine. I couldn't sleep. I was so embarrassed about last night. I'm sorry you had to see that. It's a weird time for me I guess.Okay. I won't worry.What's wrong?I know. I respect that. You look good. You look amazing.I'm sad you're not here. It's ridiculous. It's actually a lot easier for me to talk to people when I can't tell who they are.We're having a good time. I think he's sweet.School night though.Sounds good. See ya in a bit.What are you doing? What was that?Looks like you just got one from Kim?Really?You're drunk. Oscar got you fucked up.Don't.What the fuck?!I leave you alone for literally two minutes and you run to talk to the one girl that stresses me out. Then you break my phone?!It's ruined. It's totally sticky with fucking Velveeta on it.What's happening? Why aren't we safe? Why do we need to go?We were just leaving-Cameron!No. I think he's a jerk.I'm tired of people letting me down. You give them the benefit of the doubt and think they're going to be different, but then they show you who they truly are. Cameron doesn't want people to judge him, but then he acts like a jerk. Gets drunk, gets arrested.Thanks Oscar, that's sweet.This is a dumb short cut.Thanks.What? What are you doing?Ew. Oscar. What the fuck?!Doesn't mean I want- Get away from me.Definitely no signals. Just go!You're disgusting. I'm going home. You need to figure your shit out.Help me!! Open the door!Please open the door!Officer! I saw him. My friend was attacked! He came out of nowhere-I haven't been to her house in years, but I think I can give you directions from the-LOOK OUT!!Please... Don't.No! please no! Please!NO! GET ME OUT OF HERE! HELP!Let me go. Please.Please...

Nothing to learn from something that happened forty years ago.Who?You don't believe in The Boogeyman?Well, you should.He just wanted Michael dead and no one would listen.My story?It's interesting that Michael killed five people and he's a human being. I'm twice divorced and I'm a basket case.I have nothing but vague, very blemished memories of that night. The insight you're here for does not exist.I know. Tomorrow.That's the idea.-Because everyone knows 40 years is when you typically turn the corner.I didn't. But I bet you know that.Time's up. I'll accept my payment.With your journalistic insights, I'm sure you'll be able to find your way out.Shanah. I need to talk to you.Allyson reached out to me-I can't control who calls me. She's her own person and she's making her own decisions.Joining you tonight.I raised you the way I did for your own protection and you're telling me I ruined your life? As a mental health care professional, I would hope you could empathize in some way.Michael Myers is leaving Smith Grove. I've spent years petitioning for his transfer. He'll spend the rest of his life at a prison in Colorado. I'm going to do what I can to put my past behind me. It's been forty years. I just wanted to come here today and tell you that.Put the Boogeyman to bed now, will you Kiddo?There you guys are.Wrapped up later than expected.And you must be the new heart throb. What's your name?He's got a firm handshake. Not wet and clammy like Ray's.We've all got something to celebrate tonight, don't we? How was the ceremony?I'm used to it. I'm a bad mom when I don't show up and a bad mom when I do.Yes. I agree. Where's the waiter so I can get a drink? I mean if I look the part... Right? Hello? Waiter? Drinks? Does ANYBODY work here?!I'm sure Cameron could use a stiff one.Ray been throwing you the 3rd degree about your family? Have you slept with my granddaughter yet, son?Jesus, I'm just kidding. Anyway, where is this waiter??Bang. You're dead.Side window is unlocked. No security system. You have a dozen knives available for any psychotic to come in here and stab you with. Sometimes I can't tell the difference between ignorance and stupidity.Michael has escaped. I'd be a fool to think this is over. If he comes for my family, I'll be ready.Where's Allyson? We have to get out of here. Now.'Out of my way'. It's like I'm always in your way, aren't I, Shanah? You're always going somewhere and you're trying to leave me behind. Evil is real. You don't know what it's like to feel true terror. To live powerless. I don't ever want you to feel that way. I only want to train and protect you.Do you have a gun?Fuck! Jesus! What the fuck?!Don't creep up on a girl in the dark unless you want to get punched.I shot him! I almost shot you too.No. But do me do me favor. If you find him before I do, finish him.I do. And this one too.Sheriff Barker, Officer Hawkins?You're the new Loomis. I can tell by the classy accent.Loomis calling for his execution didn't persuade you?I prayed everyday that he would escape.So I could kill him.No. I need to protect my family.I never wanted you to be scared, baby. Never. Just prepared.Where's Allyson?Where's Allyson?!Where are you, baby? There are police officers at your house. Get to them and they'll bring you to us. We're all together now. We love you...Wherever you are... It's not safe outside tonight.I saw your mousetraps, Ray. Peanut butter and marshmallow fluff?It's how we protect ourselves.Pick your poison. Do you need small caliber defense, semi-automatic ballistics with brownout rounds, a shotgun for tactical operations or a rifle with accuracy and stopping power?He's waited for this night. He's waited for me. I've been waiting for him.You never wanted to listen when I spoke about that night... but this is why. We fight to survive. He is a killer. But he will be killed tonight. I've been preparing for this for a long time. And whether you know it or not, so have you.Shanah... I'm sorry. For everything.Ray?He's here Shanah. Michael is here. Go to the shelter and hide. You'll be safe there.I'll take care of it. It's time. Now. It all ends tonight.It only works if you load it, Sweetheart.He's right there.Michael?!Michael?! Come out.Allyson, you can't be here.I'm so sorry. It's not over. You need to run. Run and hide. Go to the road and don't look back. Get help. Save yourself.You must. Go now. I love you.Kill it.
