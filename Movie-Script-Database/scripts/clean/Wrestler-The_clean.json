This is definitely not okay.I guarantee this woman's 50 times hotter than whatever goombah skank you're about to marry.I was just trying to help.You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.We're talking one of the historic matches in history. 20,000 people. Another million and a half watching at home on pay-per-view.We were going back and forth, just killin' each other for a half hour. Any wrestling fan, they know all about it.Yeah, it was big. So a rematch... (smiles, contemplating theGoddamn you are smokin'.Who knows. I put on a good show...Could be the thing that gets me back on top.Got cut tonight.Ah, it's nothing.How's this for fake?1986. Denver Coliseum. Billy Bob Banjo hit me with his two-by-four. Loose nail tore the bicep open.I got even better.1988. Orlando Arena. Mr. Magnificent tossed me out of the ring. Landed on my shoulder, clavicle snapped in half.Not when they're going crazy for you...What's that?Huh. I'll have to check it out.What do I owe?No prob. You're right on the way.So how big's this place?That place?God bless hardcore...Whatcha think?Let's see if they got extension cords.Call me Randy.So how we lookin', doc?Great.

I appreciate it.Last week.Yeah, yeah. Feelin' much better.It was while I was wrestling. I collapsed in the ring.Yeah, it was pretty fucked up.Tell ya, though, it was a big hit with the fans. Promoter told me everybody was hanging around wondering if I was okay, they wound up buying up all of his T-shirts and shit. Whole merch table got cleaned out.Doctor says I can't wrestle no more.I don't know. I don't know what to do. If I can't wrestle...Time's all I got. I just sit there all day...That's why I came to see you.We don't really get along too good.She don't need me.I'm Randy The Ram. I've taken bigger bumps than this.Maybe I'll give my daughter a call.Why the fuck not? I'm her father. A person only gets one father in this life.Unless you're adopted.Definitely.Hey... Is Stephanie home?Her father.Where you going?Stephanie!Can we talk?Wait! Where ya going?You in school? That's great.What school?What school?Middlesex? That's kind of a hike. Where's your car?

No. It's not like----What are you doing?Stephanie!Why not?Sold the shit outta that one.I gotta give credit. DiFusco came up with the idea. We're setting up an angle for a grudge match.What minivan?Looks great.I'll start loosening up.You got it, broski.Hey.Better. Good.Good. Fine.Not too good, actually. She tore me a new asshole.I was thinking about maybe getting her a present.I'm not sure.22, 23?I don't know.I'm a shitty fuckin' father.That could work.Yeah?Okay. Cool.Good tip. Thanks.I'm gonna grab a drink at the bar.That was fast.Yeah?All right. Thanks.Hey, Wayne. Got a sec?I was wondering if you had something more steady. Full-time.That works.What is it?So, like, working with customers?That's the only thing you got?Hey.I almost didn't recognize you. You look all... clean.Like classy.Nah, nah, I don't mean that bad. I like it. It's like in \"Grease\", where she turns into the hot rock `n' roll chick at the end. Except backwards.So, uh... Should I call you Cassidy or Pam?This is awesome... (rubs hands together,She's kinda skinny, a little shorter than you.Maybe. Not really. I'm not sure.Not really...Hey, Pam?Thank you very much.I think she might be a lesbian.Does that help?Ah, maybe she's just a friend.What's that? The green.It's perfect.Thanks again.I never woulda known about this place.Man, I worked up a pretty good thirst in there. What say we grab a beer?One beer! We gotta re-hydrate!You have a kid?I had no idea.Boy or girl?How old?Wow... I had no friggin' idea.Wait.Now both our kids got something.You're gonna turn this down, too?

But...Open it.The \"S\" is for \"Stephanie\".I got it just for you.No reason. Just because. Do you like it?I was looking in this store and saw it, and I just said, \"That is it.\"So what are you doing now?Got any time? I was thinking we could swing by our old favorite spot.You'll remember when you see. Whaddaya say?What kinda things?You ain't got stuff! C'mon, give an old man a break.You really don't remember?Guess you were pretty young.There used to be this funhouse. The Monster Motel...They had this cheesy-ass skeleton that popped out of a coffin.

I'd have to walk you the whole way through like that.I do.I accept your apology.Not like that. I just mean... You made amends. I free you.Anything you've ever done or said or thought, I forgive. You've done nothing wrong to me. And anything I've ever done... I'm sorry. Truly.I was young. My career was booming. All those lights, the fans, the crazy shit on the road...

Two!...By the time Ruckus fixes the tire, we've had so many Nyquil coladas we don't even realize we missed the damn gig!Swear to God. Can't make stuff like that up.You never heard that one?Oh, man, fuckin' classic. 1990. Nashville Coliseum, Rage In The Cage II. I'm in the locker room shaving when behind me the stall door opens. I turn and there's Chris Columbo on the can taking a dump. He goes, \"This is for Petrov\", fuckin' wipes his ass, takes the shit-covered toilet paper and rubs it in his armpit. Five minutes later, he's in the ring with Petrov in a headlock, poor Petrov stuck there in CC's pit lookin' like he's gonna puke!Dude's got taste.Who's that?Me neither.Hey.Is Stephanie home?I'm so, so sorry. I completely, TOTALLY----I feel horrible.I know I fucked up. I fucked up bad.I'm trying to change. Really. I can't stand when I----Jesus!

Yo, Carl.Yeah, well, I'm here.When you get settled in, we should go over things.Y'know, the spots.You don't wanna hash it out?We should have at least a basic plan.Ready to do this?What are you doing here?This ain't the best time to talk.What about your heart?I'll be fine.They always say that. Whatever you got.I know what I'm doing in there. Out here's where I get hurt.Fuck the real world. Nobody gives a shit about me in the real world.Listen to them! This is where I'm great. This is where I belong.I gotta go.I'll see you after the show.Enjoy the show.I just got one thing to say to you people...Thank you.You take your lumps and bruises in this game. But you know what? It's all worth it. Because of you guys. Your cheers keep me young. They make me feel alive. In 1982, the year I wrestled my first professional match, I was six- foot-one. By 1993, I was five-foot- eleven. Three back surgeries in 11 years knocked two full inches off my height. I may be down to five- eleven, but performing in front of you people has always made me feel 10 feet tall. And that's the way it's always gonna be.Forever.You're workin' pretty light here.Anytime you wanna join in.Much.It's time.Let's do this.", "clean_line": "oh look suplex tombstone piledriver catch
