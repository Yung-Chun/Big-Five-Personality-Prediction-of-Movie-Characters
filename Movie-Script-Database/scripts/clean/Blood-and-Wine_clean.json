{"Blood-and-Wine": {"ALEX": {"raw_line": "Twenty people tonight. I got a South Beach widow, a plastic surgeon -- they actually came together.There I was, passing the wine, passing the bread, I suddenly felt like the priest at Masst Or maybe Mass started out as a wine tasting, and Jesus was a salesman. what do you think? He goes into-- Ever heard of Georges Duboeuf? He throws away some of the glasses.Duboeuf has a nose and a palate -- like a gift from God. He can taste a single grape before the harvest... and describe the beaujolais it's going to produce. She laughs.Victoria's Secret 95. She passes her glass under his nose.Gabriella, I picked these wines.All I can smell is your perfume. She laughs.I even bought it for you. She opens her shirt. She's not wearing a bra. She lowers her breast to the glass and then to his mouth.It means something to me.Oh, yeah... We're pretty good. He kisses her goodbye, unlocks the door. She goes out to her Honda Civic. Alex doesn't wait to see her drive off before he heads back to finish cleaning up the tasting room.Pop the. trunk.I just want to show you something. Worked by the combination of natural curiosity and Alex's charm; the repo man pops the trunk and gets out of the still-running car.Do you drink?Two cases of single malt whiskey aged in the barrel before he was born.So are you. Drink it with the kid. Teach him what smooth is. Enjoy yourselves. Isn't that worth a few days' breather...It's late, Jason.You can't'fish all night and work all day.No wonder you drop bottles.Do you do it on purpose?I almost knocked it over trying to get out of the car.Use a regular knife.Pointed, it's a fucking weapon. Put it away.And keep your voice down. Your mother's asleep.You have no idea, none, zip, what goes on in a marriage.I asked him to clean up downstairs.A modicum of cooperation, you know?Hey!Jason has gone into his room. He slams the door.You'll like this one better.I've been so busy. We could sneak away for a week.. Would you like that?Rob, has Jason shown up? A man's French-accented VOICE answers him from the store.You have his paycheck there?Just get in the car.You stink.There's Wash IN Dries in the glove compartment. Jason opens the compartment, finds the packets, opens one, rubs his hands.... I'm trying here, Jason -- I really am. When you didn't want to go to college, I took your side, I said fine -- I mean, I -didn't finish college, and I've done all right. I gave you a job', a steady check, which is more than anybody else has done. And what do I get back? Shit. I've tried to teach you the business -- the care, the finesse... Jason laughs dismissively.Well, look at it this way, Jason, someday you'll have your boat and I'll have my vineyard, and the best part '11 be they're nowhere near each other.Save the stamp. They turn into the driveway to an expensive development.Hi, mike -- what's the score?Don't underestimate Marino. Mike ticks off the appointment, raises the gate.Wine delivery. The INTERCOM CLICKS off. They hear FOOTSTEPS approaching. The door opens. Jason's eyes focus. He's hooked. Gabriella is smiling at Alex. She has her arms full of clean burp cloths.How are you? She glances politely toward Jason, not at all expecting what she sees. A circuit connects between them.Gabriella takes care of Baby Reese.Aren't you covered on your home policy?Do you want to see the label? She hides her hurt by not looking at him.I'm going to check the storage room, see what else'll travel. I know I put some vintage Armagnac in there, maybe some Porto? He heads down the gangplank.Look how beautiful you are. He's an idiot if he didn't. Now she sees the necklace.Just put it on for a minute. Look at yourself. She slaps at his hands half-heartedly, but it's so tempting.See what you deserve.into her ear) Not against your skin. He starts to pleat her T-shirt loose from her jeans. She doesn't resist. They watch each other in the mirror.Ah... shit... He hurriedly unhooks the necklace and puts it back in the pouch, gathers up the insurance papers and Polaroids that had spilled and slides them back in the envelope with the pouch.' Gabriella is tucking in her T-shirt. She closes the closet door. Jason's VOICE is closer, more impatient, at the bottom of the stairs.I was in the bathroom. He walks down the stairs. A wooden case of liquor is by the terrace doors, where he left it.Give me a hand, will you? I'm not as young as you are.There's an optimist in every game.(overriding htm,He's got peepee in his veins! Life for that guy's a habit and stained pants. You know what I mean? Dave laughs, feeling better.Try.You want to cut for what's here. Victor chuckles..it's appraised at a million three hundred thousand dollars. a laugh. Victor tosses the photo back on the table withI have access. Victor shakes his head no.And broke.Bullshit. You need as much as I do. Victor's eyes blink behind his glasses.I have a friend in the house.I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdcan distract her.She'd never know, I don't want her to know... I like her too much.Because I know a good thing when I see it. Alex flips over a card. It's the king of clubs.Victor... Victor has been distracted by Alex's proposition. Now he comes back to scoop up his money. Alex sweeps the cards back into a stack, leaving only the photo on the table.... But this is fifty-fifty..I saw the light still on. I'm glad you're up.C'mon, c'mon, be nice.I told you I was playing poker tonight. He hands her the glass. She takes a sip.I won.Let's not get into this, honey. Her voice is tired.I know -- He reaches for his wallet.I got you a new one.Everything's about to change. Suzanne has heard that too often from him.all the time!I am making an effort heretDid you never have a fight with his father?-- A saint. I should've guessed. Must be at the right amid of God this very minute. Suzanne doesn't bother replying. She turns off the light, pulls the sheet to her shoulders. Alex sits down on the window seat to enjoy the champagne in the dark.You want to hand me down a good cognac? I'm going out to the Reeses.He wants to talk. He dusts off the bottle.-- not to want to take a chance, with a month away. That's what I thought.Second honeymoon.-- It may need a part replaced.Have a good cruise. I'll take care of this.You look ridiculous.No. Victor opens the front door.--- Is your makeup melting? Offended, Victor reaches over to honk the horn. Alex stops him, opens the driver's door.I was helping you out. I checked off the appointment, didn't you see it? He rings the doorbell again.I know., but the nanny's supposed to be here -- Victor rolls his eyes, unseen. The nanny.It can't wait.You all right?Can you fix the thing, Harold? Or does it have to be replaced?Down there, wasn't it? The guard doesn't let him change direction.Is that our fault?All right, then. The guard glances up at the hatch. In that moment victor winks at Alex; he scored.What the fuck are you doing??You put me in the shot.Give me the film, Victor._ victor's hand glides into the drawer. Alex sensibly stops short.What's this supposed to be?Meaning you're too chickenshit to do it yourself.Fuck... He looks at the ticket.I don't fly economy.... May I speak with Gabriella? Puedo hablar con Gabriella? No, yo no quiero dejar un mesajo, gracias. Voy a llamarla mas tarde. ...Si. Buenas tardes. He hangs up and speed-dials a number from the typed list on the wall.... Hey, Ted -- it's Alex Gates. I need a couple of tickets to New York for tonight, first class. Don't sweat the account, I'll payI got your note. Fuck the Reeses. We're taking a trip, honey. Pack a bag. I'll pick you up in an hour.Does it matter?Ohio.Don't worry, it's not Ohio. She laughs.Napa. I got a problem with a supplier. Boutique wineries -- they're all owned by ex-lawyers.I need to see the wholesaler.Honey, I don't have to. I will, out of courtesy. It's Mrs., and she's fifty years old, Suzanne. She's the agent.I worked my ass off for you with that store. Eight years of twelve- hour days and one-day weekends! So don't tell me I haven't treated you well.When I get back.Sssh, calm down -- She tries to slap him again, but he gets hold of her hand.-- Give me my keys, I need my keys. I don't want to hurt you.(breathless from thehasn't moved. Suzanne drops to her knees beside him and squeamishly lifts his wallet out of his pocket, snatches the cash, lets the wallet fall back beside him. Her breathing is so rapid and shallow it sounds like whimpers.I'll fucking kill her.Not for a month. Plenty of time. Victor sighs.To the Gulf? Three hours. He removes the towel from his head.I'll stop at my doctor's.Let's hope we'll find her before she sells.Hey! What's wrong?Or he wouldn't have lied.Napa's farther north. Victor comes out of the bathroom. He's waiting for news.I love you. Her smile vanishes.She wants to talk to you.Just fucking say hello, okay? Victor takes the phone.Happy? Satisfied? I'm working.Are there any messages? She carries the phone to the counter where she keeps mail and any messages and starts to leaf through the stack. Her eye falls on a crumpled light blue envelope; she moves it out from the pile. It has been forwarded several times. And it's addressed to her.What about the messages?Thanks, honey. I'll call-you tomorrow. G'd'night . He hangs up, excited. Victor has already started to pack.You all right?How about for me? Victor takes out the photo of Alex with the necklace and holds it up for him.You're sick. I'll do it. Alex throws open the door and barrels out of the car.A seventeen-year-old kid waltzes in with a diamond as big as your toenail, and you don't wonder?? You shouldn't have touched iti You know that! All right, okay. When we recover the rest of the necklace, I'll be back. Do not, do not sell it. I'll see what I can do for you, Raines.Smart lady. She lets Jason make the sale. They get caught, he's underage, and she don't know a thing. I gotta give her credit.There.Easy, easy -- he'll see us.I just need to talk to her.We need to get some help!-- Oh, Christ... He lifts her shirt to see how badly she's cut and presses the heel of his hand against the gash to try to stop the bleeding. Her blood spurts through his fingers. With his other hand he pats down her body.I think he's okay, Suzanne. Just' tell me where it is. She can't answer. He opens the glove compartment and feels inside. He goes through her purse.Goddammit! Leaning over the seat, he fumbles with her clothes. He's trying to make her comfortable.She's dying, for chrissake!What? -- \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 She mumbles something indecipherable. He puts his ear close to her mouth. The SIRENS are bearing down.... I didn't mean for this to happen.Hey, there... how do you feel?I flew straight back from Napa when I heard. You hit your head pretty hard. Jason struggles to sit up, his equilibrium not fully restored.She didn't make it as far as the hospital. Horror and rage flood Jason's face.-- Don't, don't --Where's my son??You let an underage boy with a head injury walk out of here by himself??Gabby?I've been looking for you for two days! Jason relishes this.How'd you get here?Why didn't you wait for me? Jason eats without answering.And what about all your stuff, and your mother's? Jason swallows, wipes his mouth., Hello, Gabby.What are you doing. Jason gets up from the table. He's wearing workout clothes.Oh,. please. I don't need two children in the house. -- What happened to your mouth? Gabriella's hand jumps to her lip.You have something that belongs to .me, Jason -- and I want it back.I was holding it for someone. These are dangerous people.Don't screw around with me, Jason. He's in a position to crush Jason's windpipe. Jason shoves the barbell up in his face, finishing the set and re-racking. He reaches for his towel and wipes his face, his expression hidden.It was an accident! What did I have to do with it? Jason wads up his towel and throws it at Alex.Did you see who was in it? Jason shakes his head no.I met one of these guys. Tall, weird-looking fucker with.a gray crew-cut. These people you don't steal from. Whoever was following Suzanne is going to come after you, too. Haven't you figured that out? For the first time Jason wavers.; it's a plausible alternative, but one that makes him guilty instead.Doesn't matter. Give the necklace back to me, and we'll split the handling commission. His ingratiating smile offends Jason. He doesn't trust Alex. He shakes his head.He's gonna make a move.Okay. He hangs up and rocks back in his chair.(muffled against herI think he's probably figured out why we sleep in the same bed, Gabby.... So do I. Gabriella props herself up on her elbow.We need to go somewhere, just us.I'm buying a vineyard in France. Have you ever been to Paris?We'll stay at the Ritz, we'll eat our way through every three-star restaurant in town -- a new dress every night -- would you like that? Gabriella laughs in wonder and turns onto her side to face him. They fit themselves together like an old married couple.-- We'll drive down through Burgundy -- follow the Rhone into Provence, wind up on the Riviera -- Monte Carlo --They have tables at the casino where you play baccarat and the bets start at a hundred bucks.Sure.James had an expense account. He rolls onto his back, she lays her cheek on his graying chest. He no longer wants to make love.What made you think of the necklace? She's drifting toward sleep.A man with your breeding usually rings the doorbell.(through teeth clenchedCome on, this is pitiful. Victor drops onto the sofa. He gags on the blood in his throat and desperately draws in air.What a mess. He picks up a sofa pillow to arrange it for him. Victor gives him a grateful smile. Alex presses the pillow down over his face before he can react. His feet flail. Alex has to lie on top of him to hold him down. A couple making out on the couch. The GUN THUMPS to the floor. Victor's movements slow, and stop. Alex takes no chances. He keeps the pillow jammed down until there's no possibility of trickery. Satisfied, he rolls Victor's dead body onto the floor, steps over it, and with steady hands he opens a bottle of very expensive wine. He pours a glass.What took you so long.Just tell me how to find you. He opens another drawer. There's a gun inside.Good morning! I brought donuts. Jason is struck silent. He sits down on the side of the boat, his arms around his ribs.Oh, it's not as bad as all that.She has some residual loyalty, yeah.Where are we going?No, it's a beautiful day for a boat ride. Give us a chance to talk. He makes himself comfortable.This one?-- If we could manage to ignore the personal history here, I think we could work something out between us. Jason turns the boat toward the open sea.You want Gabriella? This is the way to have her. Life costs, Jason. Love costs. And you love her more than I do.(as Jason glances atHe's feeling like you let him down. .She gives Alex a look that silences him. He reaches for another donut. The SOUNDS of the ENGINE and the HULL hitting the waves substitute for conversation.We're giving you a hard choice, Gabby. Two rich men. Gabriella swivels her head slowly.Jesus! What the hell is that?I'd just get in his way. His hand comes to rest on her shoulder as Jason expertly reels in the bucking hammerhead. She shrugs away from his hand. Jason has hooked a ten-foot, three-finned sea beast with a spade-shaped head and black eyes on each side. He attaches the line to a winch and winds it up onto the deck. It twists wildly, knocking things over until it slows down and finally lies very still. His chest heaving with the effort, Jason looks around. Alex has disappeared without either of them noticing.No.scrambles toward the necklace.Help me, help.mel! Gabriella runs down into the cabin. Much as he hates Alex, Jason can't let him die. like this. He charges. forward and straddles the shark, jams the blade of his knife into the primordial brain. He twists the handle once. The shark dies instantly. Trembling with adrenalin, Jason gets off its back. With his elbows Alex drags himself out of the jaws. He's badly mangled.. The shark slowly changes color to a dull brown.You knew it wasn't dead. Jason squats down beside him to access his injuries.Then you killed her yourself. Jason slowly nods.Jesus. You set me up. You had her call me.What's your name?-- No, listen, listen -- this is worth a fortune. (thrusting the necklaceWait, don't go! Come back here.

Leaning against the corner is a woman wearing only her panties and a shirt. In her mid-twenties she has striking South American looks. GABRIELLA VASQUEZ. She's sipping red wine from a plastic glass.Oh, you have competition.Okay. Show me.So what is it?I'm not wearing any.Tell me now. He kisses her wet breast.Don't think you have to say it because .1 say it, Alex.on the intercom) Who is it?Oh, the boss himself!Is the wine for the boat? Come through the house.ugly, isn't it. He grins and relaxes, looks around.Oh, a boat type.I'm not going, 'I can't go.I\u00e2\u0080\u00a2don't have a green card, I can't leave the country. Baby goes with an American nurse. I house-sit. It's fine.God. I'm obvious. I just don't like working for people, but that's life. He chafes under authority the same way she does.Maybe not with a rich stepfather. He laughs.Venezuela. Do I look it?Well, I don't. My mother's Indian. The India kind of Indian.You don't know melYes, Mrs. Reese.Right there. She slides off the stool.He.'s ready for his nap.What are you doing? She snatches the necklace away from him and fairly runs down the hall to Frank's study.You're going to get me fired and deported.Mrs. Reese? The baby's ready forJust to get his sheets.He's in his playpen. Dina sweeps out.I was supposed to let him into the Reeses'.No, I'm not. She's walking toward the door.I just got fired, all right? She goes out.You don't know anything!They shed on the couch I'll have to sleep on. You know how long it took me to find that job? Everybody thinks they're running for office. You don't have papers, they don't even want to meet you. And the only real way to get legal is to get married. Do you understand? He opens her car door for her.... Are you old enough to vote? She slides behind the wheel.Aren't you working?Well, let's not tell the boss I stole you.The size of their staff? It is.Not for the wharf.Will you teach me? He laughs.I'm only investing an afternoon. She takes in the landscape, breathing in the lovely isolation.Where are we?I don't know if I would like boats after that. He smiles.How old were you?I am not taking my clothes off.I want to go back now. Can we go back, please?What?Me, too.Where are we going?Sure.Hello? She's greedily grateful to hear Alex's voice.-- Hi! I saw on the news there's rain in San Francisco. Are you wet and miserable?Tell me you love me.Who just laughed?I miss you.It's lonely here. There's no return address. She slits it open with her thumbnail. A trickle of sand falls out.I'm looking! Instead, she opens the letter.Here it is. Mr. Raines called from . He said you-Id know what it was about. Do you,- need the number?Jason! -- Don't hurt me. Please.He went to get you! He's not coming back until tomorrow. She timidly pulls the sheet over her body. Jason yanks it off her so hard it flaps loose from the corners. He touches her belly with the length of his knife, the blade \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 flat to her skin. She freezes.It's been here since he went to Napa.They'll lock you up.'Away from the sky and the air and the sea and the current running against the wind?' That was a very beautiful letter. Jason moves onto the bed, on his knees. beside her.I never mentioned itl Jason's hand curves around her throat,. a, caress, a threat.Not He wasn't interested, he didn't care.He was glad she left. Jason lies down alongside her.W-why? He shrugs; he doesn't trust her.How do you know? She thinks grief has driven him crazy, and he sees that.... I'm so very sorry about what happened to your mother. His hand skitters away and lights on her ribs.. Don't do this for revenge.I love you. He gives her a hard look. She holds his gaze and pushes his jeans down until he finally kicks them off and they're both naked. They begin to make love.Wait. Jason doesn't understand. She gently pushes him back.This way. She turns on her stomach and guides him back into her. Jason moves now rapidly.Slowly. Her hand on his ass guides the pace. She hasn't had a young man in a long time.Will you get me a towel? With warm water.Are you going to kill me, too?You'll have to. I'll know. I'll be a witness. I'll know you planned it.I need him, Jason.I'm not going back to Caracas! You don't know how we live there. She pulls the pillow in front of her to hide her nakedness. He touches her shoulder; she shrugs him away.Watch me. He closes the door with a solid CLICK. She starts to cry, and still crying, she pulls the sheets off the bed, she has to change the sheets.(too bright andHow about a sandwich?He just lost his mother, Alex. You can't expect him to act normal. He steps up beside her and moves her hair off her shoulders.Yes. I gave him sonlething to eat. She walks out and up the stairs to the bedroom.I wanted her to go away so bad... I used to wish she'd die. And then she did. He lets go of her hand.Oh. -I bit my lip. He takes her lip between his and nuzzles it.-- I'm already asleep, honey.Can he hear us? Alex's tone turns. Jason is causing him another problem.What?Where?No. Alex scoots down next to her, his hand takes possession of her ass.-- Princess Stephanie. He gives a rueful laugh; she's younger than he easily remembers.You won't be able to afford it. You'll have spent all your money on my clothes and my jewelry. (slipping her legI'll wear something like that and then if you lose you can throw it on the table to cover your bet, like James Bond.I looked good in it, didn't I? He pats her shoulder without answering. He won't sleep for a while.I can't just -- what am I going to tell him.Okay. Here I am. What is it? Do you know how much a cab costs?I'm so sick of this. You'd say anything! He hands her the newspaper.reads the headline and starts to laugh.There is such a thing as justicel Dina's necklace. Couldn't happen to a better person.You really hate him.... The sonofabitch. That's why he went out with me. He was trying to use me! They'll think I'm part of it! The maid who got fired??What difference does it make??I'm with him.He has a boat, Alex! It's on the boat. The dumb shit wants to turn it over to the cops. You know what'll happen to me.

Alex is also on the stairs.Yeah, well, I'm learning more than I want to.It's not an argument.A modicum. What's that. Modicum my ass. He pushes past his mother toward his own room. Suzanne follows him down the hallway, leaving. Alex behind.Then go to bed.Whatever. She walks out.:. Bite...Time to go to work, man! C'mon. A tall, black drifter appears from-below, still yawning, scratching. HENRY, 33. He wears a red Panama hat that's weathered his head for some time.Let's find out. He hauls back on the rod, the line rises from the ocean, they both recognize the fish at the end.This one's got more to worry about than you do. He starts to reel in the fish. Henry moves to the wheel.-Oh, yeah. Jason braces for the fight.My skill. ... My fins.I'm cool.You ever caught a shark?Lemme -- lemme show you something. Jason pulls up the sleeve of his denim jacket to display a fresh gash across his arm.He was already gaffed onto the side of the boat, good as dead. Two hours dead! And I was still too close to the mouth. Revenge is the last instinct to go, did you know that? The chef shrugs and shows his thumb, missing a joint.I washed.Hi.Big boat. Gabriella laughs and looks over her shoulder at him. They're both kids.The fittings are definitely -- yeah on the ugly side. But damn, she's solid.I like.boats. Gabriella shows him the climatized, built-in wine closet next to the galley. He starts to rack the bottles while she watches. He talks to stop her from leaving.So where you headed?They don't want to take the baby.You don't like them. Gabriella laughs.Doesn't have to be.Worst kind.Where's that?I don't know, I never been there.You don't seem too nuts. She laughs.-- when you're skimming along the water, nothing between you and the bottom of the sea but a layer of wood, your thoughts... end. All that noise inside your head? Gabriella nods, understanding exactly.. . . Stops. Dina's VOICE booms over the INTERCOM, startling both of them. The BABY is FUSSING. Gabriella makes a gesture of apology to Jason.You should come out with me sometime. She smiles without answering and goes topside. His eyes follow her. A Deckhand comes down the ladder with the remaining case of wine for him to stock.-- Alex? They're waiting for you! Alex blows out a frustrated breath.Alex!I'll deliver it for you.You looking for Alex? You missed him.So now you're in trouble.Then why've you-been crying?Congratulations.You hated it there!What's wrong with cats?So let's go get married. Gabriella looks at him. They connect.again; it scares her.It's my lunch break..Did you do something? Or was it just...Like they're a factory?Hang a left.I know. Just turn! She whips the car through the turn, narrowly missing another car.-- Cool. She laughs; she's starting to relax.You can learn on the fish around here, but you can't eat 'em. They're junk fish.Oh, you think you're ready for that kind of commitment?My father used to bring me here. She hears something in his tone.He's dead. He drowned in a storm. She shivers involuntarily.He was a fisherman.I feel close to him when I'm on the water.-- Eight. I'd just turned eight. She takes his hand. He tightens his fingers through hers and looks out at the horizon, trying to control the emotions her sympathy has roiled. Gabriella senses this. She puts her arms around him, kisses him on the cheek. They stand, holding each other. Then Jason, on impulse, kisses her on the lips.You can do anything you want out here -- you can swim nude, you can Her laugh cuts him off.That's not what I meant.Hey, quit laughin'. I'm saving your life here.You waited long enough to tell me. Gabriella arranges her clothes.No, you're not. She scrambles to her feet.... Sure. He stands up and moves to the helm, his legs stiff with injured dignity. Gabriella sits down on the bench, the cushion clutched in front of her. Jason sneaks a look back at her. With her hair wet and her makeup washed away, she looks younger than he does. She's resting her chin on the edge of the cushion. He switches on the engine and eases the boat forward over the anchor, engages the power winch. The CHAIN starts toI'm sorry. She turns her head toward him.-- Hey, hey.What the hell happened in there?Not enough. What'd you hit him with?Pull over, pull over. He wrenches the wheel and steers the car to the curb.I'm driving.We'll head for the Gulf, see what we like. He sounds like her contemporary, not her kid.Do you still miss him? Slowly she shakes her head no.Order something for me, okay? I'm stiff, I need to walk around. He's already walking away. Concern and exasperation cancel each other; she goes inside.My grandmother asked me to bring in a necklace of hers -- Jason takes the velvet pouch out of his pocket, unlaces it, spreads out the necklace on the counter. He leans forward on his elbows while the jeweler examines it with a loupe. When the jeweler looks up, he's angry.-- Those aren't real diamonds.We'll starve. The waitress laughs as she strolls away.Let's pack it up, picnic on the beach someplace.Adrenalin does that.I can't believe you did that.I didn't even say goodbye.-- How much money do we have? Suzanne doesn't reply.Dear Gabriella. I don't know if you'll get this letter. I don't know if I'll send it. All I know is that for some reason I need to write it...That day on the boat made me realize I understand the sea better than I do the world.I'm right here. Suzanne shoves her fingers through her damp hair, swallows to clear her voice.What dog? She lies down again.-- I know what lure to use to catch any fish in the water, but what's the lure for a woman? Truth? Lies?One morning, just as the sky started to lighten ---- I caught a fish that had three hooks grown through his lips. Three times he'd gotten away. He kept taking the hook.It occurs to me that you're the fisherman, not me. I can feel the tension of the line. I've taken the hook just like he did.I want to take you out with me when the wind's blowing whitecaps and the current's running against the wind, just to hear your hair slap against your skin. When will I see you? He glances up.(concentrating on theDo you buy estate diamonds?It belonged to my mother. The jeweler's heard every version. He doesn't care.You don't need another grab-ass job. I been out talking to peoplelThere's charter outfits a coupla towns up the coast. . They need skippers, they need crews. She stands up, brushes off the sand, rolls up her towel.Mom? The cabin is silent. He uses his fishing knife to pop loose a section of the cheap wall paneling. Behind it, a square of sheet rock has been sliced away between the studs to accommodate the pouch. He drops the pouch in his tackle box. A CAR is heard pulling up. Jason frantically starts to jam the paneling back in place. It won't hold.I forgot my tackle box.It's not a problem. He escapes out the door.I look out at the flat blue sea, and the darker bl ue where the Gulf deepens and I want you next to me. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2I want to walk across the. sugar sand and wade into the water with you until the current lifts us and floats us, nothing weighting us down -- as'light and thoughtless as fish.

Maybe.secures the engine hatch.-- What'd you tell him? Henry chuckles.You gonna lean on me, Henry?? Is that the plan? Henry is hurt and offended.Take care of the boat?-- Mom, come on. He catches her hand and tows her toward the back door.We\"gotta go... She anxiously follows him out the door.-- I'm sorry. She glances in the rear view mirror. Headlights.Still with us.Mom! Face the road! You're drifting! She looks back as now bright headlights light them up. A truck HORN BLASTS.what are you... He swallows painfully. Alex smiles and gets up from the chair. He dreads what he has to tell him.Where's my mother?Where's Mom? -- How's Mom? Alex sits down on the bed with him to break the news.-- You killed her, you fuckl Alex tries to hold him, eventually in a forced bear-hug.Wake up, Alex. I want to see your face. The sheets stir. Jason raises his knife to strike. But it isn't Alex in the bed, it's Gabriella. She lets out a strangled scream. He whips the sheet off her with his other hand. She's naked.Where is he?His car's here.I keep hearing about Napa. Did you ever call him there? She shakes her head.You don't know where he was.You didn't waste any time,. did you. You moved right in.I'm going to wait for him, and. I'm going to kill him. His hand drifts along her body. She doesn't resist.Yeah.Did you show it to him? You two have a laugh about it?Did you tell him how to find: us-? Gabriella knocks his hand away from her throat.Sure, he did.He had us followed.I'm not crazy. Gabriella lays her hand over his on the bed, to comfort him.Her loss, your gain. Furious, Gabriella forgets her caution. She slaps him hard enough to throw his head sideways. Jason rolls on top of her and pins her down.Her home, her bed -- her life. He lowers his mouth to Gabriella's neck. His kiss is surprisingly gentle. His knee works her legs apart.Let's finish what we started. Slowly, he kisses her. She lets her mouth respond: a sweet kiss, in spite of the circumstances. His fingers scissor her nipple.Just don't tell me that you love me. He peels off his T-shirt.-- Would you do that?What are you talking about? This is my home. I'm home. She stares at him. His face is set. She can't persuade him. Jason thinks of his next step, a plan.You're never going to marry him, Gabriella.You should've called home. Alex advances.Hitchhiked.She doesn't need it anymore, and I don't want it. Gabriella brings Alex a cup of coffee.You haven't even said hello to her.Nothing. He walks out of the condo. Alex and Gabriella are left alone together. She jumps in before he can say anything.It's not yours.Did you know the thing's worth over a million dollars? What a fucking stupid way to spend money.I don't know where it is anymore. You killed the only person who did.There was a car following us!Who are they? Alex fastidiously drops the towel in the hamper.She never told me where she kept it. Alex doesn't believe him either. His hand. rests on a dumbbell, and for a murderous instant he's about to pick it up and use it on Jason. He lifts his hand away.-- Come meet me, I gotta talk to you. I'm at the Haitian marketplace. You know where it is?An thing you want. Don't drive, take a cab -- -- I'll wait for you. Jason hangs up. He looks around. He doesn't see Victor watching from the trinket stand. Be walks to the counter where he has already ordered coffee and pie. He picks up his fork. He can't eat. There's a folded newspaper left behind by another customer. He pulls it over.I saw a guy following me... I thought you weren't safe. I was going to tell you to go stay at yourRead it.Alex stole it.The reason I know is because I stole it from him. Her eyes widen.You weren't a maid.We're going to the Gulf. He throws money down for the check.accelerates. Gabriella nuzzles his neck.looks back.This is Gabriella. She's my contraband. She looks quickly at Jason, who smiles. Henry reaches out to shake her hand.She fucking called you.I'm going fishing. Get off if you want.Then make yourself useful and cast off the stern line. Alex moves to the stern while Jason casts off the bow line.There's not a lot of choice. Alex casts off. Jason backs the-boat into position. He sees Henry asleep in the doorway of the marine supplies store next to the shuttered bar. Alex rejoins him.-- Shut up! Just shut up! She sits on the bench, her face tight and angry.-- Okay. I'm ready to listen. He sits down beside a pole and looks over at Gabriella, who has put on a hat. She's staring out to sea.Something's going to bite, justHammerhead. Young. Male. Jason plays the shark until it's close to the boat and thrashing for its life. Gabriella's scared.No luck? Alex whirls around. His gun materializes in his hand. Jason retreats a step.Is this your backup plan?You want it so bad, it's yours. He pulls out the necklace and hurls it away from Alex.Mom didn't take the necklace. did.And you were in the car behind us. Gabriella drops down beside them. She has a flare gun, no longer needed, and sheets from the cabin to stop the bleeding. She starts to tear them up. She's crying slightly.Well, I didn't. Alex manages to laugh.I'll get on the radio. Gabriella wraps the strips of sheet tightly around what's left of Alex to bandage. She smears away the tears so she can see and leaves blood tracked across her face. She looks down to see his bloody hand clutching the necklace. They look at each other.has the microphone in his hand. He's setting course. Gabriella appears behind him. She's holding the flare gun. She puts it back where she found it, and steps beside him and puts her arm around his waist.

He bends down to kiss her, then heads for the television. Suzanne props herself up on her elbows. He pops a cassette into the VCR: porno, she assumes. She does her best.I liked the twin nurses. There was kind of a story. Alex brings the remote control back to bed.Rio?If we really go. Last time I packed, we went nowhere.The beaches -- I thought we had a beach. I read how the hotels keep spotters on the roof with scopes, to keep thieves away from the guests. They can look at every inch of your body through the scope. Do you mind that I like that? Alex? He has fallen asleep. Tenderly she draws the sheet to his shoulder and settles down to watch the rest of the tape.What'd you do this time? He's too pumped to take offense.Whenever you open champagne -- it's such a giveaway. He pours her a glass.You know, I've-never actually seen you play poker -- maybe poker doesn't even exist. Maybe it's just a cover story men use. He laughs.Hey; lightning strikes. He fills his glass.I was charging the groceries today, and they kept the card.

He twists her hand up behind her back, forcing her onto the sofa.Go to hell! He smothers her into the cushion and twists her hand up and up. She grips his keys tighter.You sonofabitch! He hits her back, her nose starts to gush, the keys drop to the-floor. He bends to pick them up. Suzanne seizes a standing metal ashtray and savagely swipes him across the temple.I won't wait for you!

It drops into the sea.You're quiet. She doesn't think he's going to answer her.It'll work itself out. People manage. We're here. This is what you always wanted.He's my son.

So does Jason who witnessed it all.I was not-fired, you jerk. I quit.For about a minute it was very satisfying.... Look at you. What's the occasion? Jason squats down beside her and balls up the classifieds.So we're packing. They start walking together. From the water a MAN calls out to Suzanne.... Too bad. I kinda liked thatNice boat.

He can read their faces, but not their lips.There was, is, no time.I know you keep money here somewhere.The. cops are about to drive up your street. He brings the club down on Alex's bare foot.Where is it? He clips Alex on the other leg as he tries to crawl away. The physical effort shortens Victor's breathing. His cough sprays blood. He tightens his grip on the club.I refuse to die in a fucking prison clinic! Alex staggers to his feet. Victor is struggling for breath.
