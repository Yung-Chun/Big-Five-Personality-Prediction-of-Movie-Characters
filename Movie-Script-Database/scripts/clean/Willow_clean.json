It could be diseased.No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby. It looks like a daikini...Mims! Get back here! It might bite you.Absolutely not.Shhh, shhh! It's the Prefect -- that's all I need. Mims, Ranon, keep this thing hidden...In the forest. My family's been gathering them since last fall. There's no law against that, Bur- glekutt.Absolutely, under no condition, is anyone in this family going to fall in love with that baby.Kiaya! We can't keep that baby. Mims, Ranon. Hey! I will not be ignored!This is bad. If we're caught with that little daikini it'll be the end of us. Careful, Ranon, I need that for the festival. Kiaya, what are we going to do?Burglekutt's right. There's not enough time to finish plowing. We'll lose everything and I'll end up working in the mines.No, no! They'll think it's a bad omen. There'll be a flood or a drought or a plague and everybody'll blame me for it!I don't know. This is trouble. I'll talk to the High Aldwin about it tomorrow at the Festival.And now! For our final amazing bit of magic, I will make an entire pig completely disappear!Meegosh, I'm in trouble.Mining. I hate closed-in spaces. That's the last thing I'd ever do. I gotta get my crop planted.Meegosh, can you watch the chil- dren? I gotta talk to the High Aldwin.Sir! I have to talk to you.It's a matter of great importance to me!Kiaya! Kiaya!We can't keep this baby, Kiaya. We must take her to the Council.My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.They'll kill her! We can't let this baby die!I can't do it! I haven't put my crop in!Yes.I will, Mims. Goodnight.Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.What a great son you are, Ranon. I wish I could take you with me. Now go to sleep...If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?I don't want courage. I don't want to be a warrior. All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!You cut your hair, Kiaya?I hate this. Where am I? I should stick you in a tree and go back home. I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.That's it. The crossroads...I hate this.I hate this.I really hate this.I will--I'll getcha water--getcha lotsa water--anything you say--!I'm not coming near you!Good. How long will it take?You be careful. I'm a powerful sorcerer. I could turn you into a toad just like that.Do any other daikinis ever come by here?I have to give this baby to some- body.No. Somebdoy put you in there for a reason. I'll wait for somebody else.Hey! Somebody's coming!Are you okay?I don't know.Don't call me a Peck. My name is Willow.Farmer.Nooo, I don't think I should.You all right?See if this helps.What's inside?Stop! Wait!Are you a warrior?What's that? I hear something!What is it?Sir? Sir!Sir! Sir! I have this baby. We found her in our village. Will you take her...?Friend of yours?I hate this.You don't know anything about ba- bies.You gotta promise to feed her.Fresh goat's milk.And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold. And keep her diaper changed.Here are her diaper rags. And this is her milk bladder. And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder. She likes that.Bye.Please take good care of her.Look, it's Willow Ufgood! He's come home! Welcome back, Willow! He deserves a medal: he's quite mystical. For honor, for bravery, for his intuitive powers... ...let's make him Apprentice Aldwin. Better still: High Aldwin! Make way! It's Willow Uf- good, High Aldwin of---Come back here, you! That's my baby!!Oh no, it's a trap!Oh noooooo!!Where am I? Where's the baby?That baby's my responsibility!Yeow! Madmartigan...I never should've trusted you...Who are you?Queen Cherlindrea?Who??Why??I'm getting her out of there!I can't go out there with the baby!Ohhh, I hate this.Why not?Trolls?This is not going well.Yes...?I can't see anything--she's too bright!You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?What a relief. Now I can go home.Me?What is Tir Asleen?Where is Tir Asleen? How far is it?You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.No I'm not. Have you really looked at me? I'm short! Even for a Nelwyn!Why can't you do it? You have mag- ical powers.They look like acorns.They're magic? Are you serious?But I've got a family to think about! They need me!Hello...?I'll do it. Yes, I will, I'll do it!But I only have one shoe.Wait till I tell my children. Stuff like this never happens in my village.How do these work I wonder? I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.Daikinis...Let's get out of here. Shhh, don't cry, Elora. Things can't get any worse than this...Don't worry--I'm a sorcerer. What could possibly happen?Could you spare some milk for this poor hungry baby?I could use your help, boys.This is not fun.Woah!You!!I trusted you...Hey! Give me that baby!Nursemaid?!Time to change her diaper.No! You can't!Because she's sick.Madmartigan! Wait!We could've been killed, Madmarti- gan!Heeyah! Heeyah!Oh no!Woah...woah...!Where's the baby??Elora Danan!Madmartigan! You saved her life!Let's get out of here before they come back.Yes it does. The Fairy Queen told me.Madmartigan, I need your help.But you're a great swordsman!You're not a warrior, Madmartigan! A warrior wouldn't lie there and do nothing!We're in trouble! You've seen the big army that's after us! You're a fake! You're a bum! You're a-- you're a coward!!I miss my wife! I miss my chil- dren! My boy Ranon! He's growing up so fast, he even helps me on the farm now! And little Mims! If you ever saw her sweet little face you'd *melt* Madmartigan, you'd *melt*! Or maybe you wouldn't. You don't know anything about love. You don't know anything about any- thing...You?Madmartigan! Madmartigan!How are we going to get out there?We need to get out to that island.We've traveled a long way. We're looking for Fin Raziel.What would the Fairy Queen say?Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen. We'd better go.Raziel? Hello? Fin Raziel?I'm Willow Ufgood. I'm here to find Fin Raziel.This can't be right. This isn't a sorceress. This is some kind of animal.We need your help. To take this baby to Tir Asleen. She's a prin- cess.Madmartigan!Help, Madmartigan! The oar!No!I can't go on...No.I'll help you...!That's all I ever wanted!If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.What do I need for that?I hope she's all right. How much more do I have to do of this?I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self. But what's this got to do with it?The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.I'm all finished. Now what?How am I gonna do that?What's going on?She needs to be changed.She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby. Soon the baby stops crying. Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire. Then his eyes focus on the fire.Madmartigan.I don't know much about him.Uh, yes. It's very nice hair.She's hungry.Here. Hold her.Sometimes she likes it heated.She's a good baby.I did it! I got the ashes!Who?She said lots of thing.sShe asked about you, Madmartigan.You're crazy. I think you're in love.I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!The limitless power of...I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?But what am I gonna transform??You?I'll do it, Raziel...Oooh, this smells terrible.Ouch!!What'd you bit me for!!His will.I just wanted to test it first.Avaggdu, supriom, luwatha...What did I do?Madmartigan. Let's go. Let's get Eloran Danan.Come on, Madmartigan...!What are you doing? Get out of there...!Nooo!!!The princess, Elora Danan.We're taking her to Tir Asleen. She'll be safe there from Bavmorda's powers.Madmartigan! I can't stand being in closed-in places.I'm used to her. How's she doing?She can't be wrong. She's a very very very powerful sorceress.That's my fault, not hers. I've got to keep practicing. I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--Ahhh!I hate this.There's nobody here.How??Beings within, beings without! Danu danu walkail funfawtha!I did it! Madmartigan! Come here! Look! You gotta see this! I did it!Tuatha tuatha danu!Raziel! I transformed them all!

Balance. Bal- ance.Raziel!Wait!!I have an idea. Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.I know, I know! But this is a way to get into that castle...Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter. She is all that matters. Are you going to abandon her?Me, too.Surrender!!We are all-powerful magicians! Give us the baby or we will destroy you!!Courage, Willow.I'm Willow Ufgood.
