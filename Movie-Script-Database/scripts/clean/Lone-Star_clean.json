No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.Masons been around a long while.Treasure hunter?S'posed to leave everything right where we found it. They're real particular about that.No telling yet if there's been a crime.But this country's seen a good number of disagreements over the years.Fellas--Yeah, he was that.I heard there was a bit of a fuss.They were here first.--Santiago.That so?I'd like to hear it. Your version of it.Never heard from him again?So he arrested all of Jimmy Herrera's people and sent 'em back to the other side?Right.Won't be another like him.Tell him I'll catch him later.Tell him to try me tomorrow.He's right.The shooter local?Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.Pilar.Something wrong?Got him here?I'll see what's going on.I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.Yeah. I'll go check on your boy.Excuse me--We got some boys you run in earlier today?You got a juvenile with 'ern--Amado Cruz?They tell me you're good at fixing things.Your father was a hell of a mechanic.You know, if you figure minimum wage on the time most thieves spend in jail, they could have bought most everything they stole.I didn't say you did. My name is Sam, by the way.He's all yours.No problem.Any time.Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.September '97, that's all she wrote.Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.That the word on our boy?Skinny?Nice job.Charley Wade.--it didn't come out of a cereal box.You know the popular version of how he left town.You got a cause of death?So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack.Colt Peacemaker.He swore by it. What?So is Buddy on your short list?You got to investigate. No question about it.Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--I haven't been out here for a while.No.We found a body out by the Army base yesterday. Been there for a long time.You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge.You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?BledsoHe still living?Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?Besides my father, I mean.And Buddy was one of them.People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.Thanks for your time, Hollis.Mrs. Bledsoe?I'm Sheriff Deeds--Yeah, that's the story of my life.I've seen 'em.You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?He had the club out on the old trail road--So you must remember Sheriff Wade.You had to deal with him in running the club.He squeezed money out of you?And my father?People didn't complain?Do you remember the last time you saw him?And that was the last time you saw him?That was the night he disappeared?And when my father was Sheriff?What was your deal with him?He ever accept cash for a favor?You finished?That makes two of us.If the next guy's a redneck.Good deal you were born down here, then.You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.Yeah. I bet he would.Excuse me--Pleased to meet you.If certain people have their way, it's going to be a new jail.Do either of you have any idea when they stopped using that site as a rifle range?Not for sure yet. But I kind of wish they hadn't.Seems like we have another one every week.People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--You ought to put up a banner-- \"Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy\"--Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--The Perdido thing?Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.We don't need a new jail.We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office. Hey, folks--Let's get this thing over with.You folks who remember my father knew him as Sheriff. But at home he was also judge, jury--and executioner.This is a real honor you're doing him today, and if Buddy was around I'm sure his hat size would be gettin' bigger every minute.I used to come to this park to hide from him. Now that you're putting his name on it--I'll have to find someplace new to duck out.I do appreciate it, and wherever he is, Buddy's puttin' the beer on ice for the bunch of you. Thank you.Nice to see you, Mrs. Cruz.Field trip?Want to take a walk?Your mother still doesn't like me.I see she built a place up here by the river.She's done well for herself--on her own and all--They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.Most people did, yeah.Yeah.Your boy, there--Nice-looking kid.No--Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--It might just be the age. I spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like Buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack.Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.You've got your mother, your kids--Remember this?Pilar--Me neither.Lupe? Get me the rangers up in Austin--Zack?What's up?I haven't seen anybody come by.Yeah. It's quiet--Sure.'Night--First bullet entered beneath the left eye, severing the optical nerve and exiting from top rear of skull causing tissue damage--and severe cerebral hemorrhaging. Second bullet entered left cheek driving fragment of upper and lower molars into base of skull. Third bullet--Hey, Pete. How's it going?How much you got left?You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?I thought he busted you a couple times.I'm surprised he bothered with it.So I've heard--Well, you were working there--You built our patio while you were on the county?I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--Murdered him?Yeah.I been working on a few things.I'm going over to the other side.No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.Gotta be in person.They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.You'd do a good job.Don't know if I'll still want it.I appreciate you telling me.You think we need a new jail?Yeah, Ray, you'd be a hell of a Sheriff.You own this place?You lived in the States for a while?Made some money, came back here--You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw itYou sell much out here?Hell of a spot to put a business.So when did Buddy leave?You think he killed anybody in Korea?No--Another woman?You know who it was?Yeah.Yeah.Nothing.You know the other day, you asked why I came back?I came back 'cause you were here.Yeah.I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.More, I hope.Two years.Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.I've felt that way, yeah.Pilar--What was your father's name?Morning, Hollis.You thought any more about our murder?Charley Wade.I got an idea what happened.I think somewhere between Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the Sheriff's car and drove him out by the Army post, I think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back.I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.That's in Maverick County.Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--You still going to all the home games?Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?No, you look good. I was just wondering.You look good--Yeah, well--You were in a fight--Same weight I always was.Best part of the job.Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?No. You?You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--Suppose not.It wasn't just you, Bunny.What?I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.\"Dearest Buddy--\"Hollis? You in there? Hollis?Fellas.Open late.Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.You two saw it, didn't you? You two saw it when Buddy killed him.Imonna find out one way or the other.Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--Buddy Deeds was a murderer.That night in the cafe--he didn't stay long after you left, did he, Hollis? Maybe he decided he'd gone too far with Wade, maybe he figured he better not wait for the Sheriff to get behind him. So he stepped out to see if he could catch up--and you were here at the club that night, weren't you, O?And the ten thousand?Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.Buddy's a goddamn legend. He can handle it.'Night, fellas.You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?Try a year and a half. He bands her an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you \"our beautiful daughter\" in the letters she wrote to him.I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--If I met you for the first time

student.We haven't had any serious violence, if that's what you mean. We've got a pretty lively mix though--you walk into the cafeteria and the Anglo kids are in one section, the Mexican kids in another and the Black kids have a table in the back--thanks--They're the smallest group except for a couple Kickapoo kids. Look, you're obviously a concerned parent. Chet has no history of getting into trouble--I'm happy to have him in my class.Okay? He's not here?He's going to wish he was dead.I think that's a bit of an oversimplification--There's no reason to be so threatened by this--I've only been trying to get across some of the complexity of our situation down here--cultures coming together in both negative and positive ways.They've got my Amado.Somebody called--something about an electronics store.We haven't talked since high school.Are you okay?You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.Okay, we have the fight against the Spanish with bloody conflict for dozens of years till they're finally defeated in 1821 and Mexican independence is declared. Anglo settlers are invited----to colonize the area and by the time they begin the movement against Santa Anna they outnumber the Mexicans here by four to one. The war between Mexico--and the Anglo forces ends in 1836 with the formation of the Texas Republic. Texas joins the United States as a state where slavery is legal in 1845--after the so-called Mexican war and then secedes to join the Confederacy in 1861. The Confederacy is beaten, and the Reformation period here is marked by range wars and race wars----and all this paralleled by constant battles between both the Mexican and Anglo settlers and the various Indian nations in the area. What are we seeing here? Chet?Oh, come on, Amado--Leave your sister out of it.Of course you can.It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.Maybe you're just getting less patient.Well, you hire illegals--If you spent a little more time training them--No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--Mami, how old were you when my father--Right. When he was killed.How come you never got married again?There must have been somebody.Nobody's too busy.Thank you.Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- \"some chulo with grease under his nails.\"You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--\"That boy\"--Mami, say his name for chrissakes!Si.Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.I can't name anybody she does like these days.A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--So she tells me three times a week.I thought you got through that pretty well.People liked him.I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I--I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--Weird what you remember.Amado.He hates me.With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.So why did you come back here, Sam?You don't want to be Sheriff.It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.They've got me. Different thing.I should get back.Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam.Yeah?For a while.What do you think?I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college----you're going to be on your own.So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.That makes it okay?Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me.How do you think you're going to make a living?You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--That isn't true.If you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was, I would be happy! I would be thrilled.I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.Honey, I think you're smart and you're good and I love you. So don't act like an idiot, all right?I don't think you can take it personally--I have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt--See you, Molly.Steve?Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.The Sheriff.I'm unmarried. I'm not available.Nobody stays in love for twenty-three years.Follow me.We thought we were something, didn't we?I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.I mean what did we know about anything?When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.Yeah?My mother hasn't changed the songs since I was 10.Wow.How come it feels the same?So what are we gonna do about this?How long have you lived here?There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--Like your story is over.It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--Yeah?Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.It's Saturday.Yeah. I had uhm--school business.Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.Enough with the clothes--I only went for my last two years.Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.When's the picture start?She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.Couple months before I was born--I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before. Didn't know she owned one.They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.So that's it? You're not going to want to be with me anymore?I'm not having any more children.
