Then I went to check the cellar and its FLOODED AND--You have a copy of the Town Charter. Seriously?Yeah, it's where Georgie died.Don't worry about it. Why do you have all this stuff anyway? I mean. What are you going to do with it?Who's first.I'll go first.Do you guys ever feel there's something wrong with Derry. Like it's, I don't know, haunted or something?I keep thinking about Ben's walls.Yeah. It's strange.I... If I tell you guys something you won't think I'm crazy.I saw Georgie last night. Only. It wasn't him.No. In my house, he tried to get me to go into the basement with him.Shut up Richie. It wasn't just him. I saw this other... I don't know.Yes. That's what it was, a scary looking clown. And it had these teeth...We should leave lookouts. Ben, Stan, can you?What happened?You okay, Eddie? Eddie Kaspbrack?Ed. Go outside. Get Ben and send him in here.You see it, don't you, Richie?We can't leave it like this. Let's clean it up.Okay, so how did he put Georgie in my basement?You okay?We know what's been taking the kids. Chief!No, we all saw it.I guess we're on our own.Think that could take \"IT\" down?What we're scared of. It was Georgie's corpse for me cuz, cuz that's what I care about. It was a naked woman for Stan because he's so afraid of-Back to point. It showered Beverly in blood cuz...It. It's everything and anything. All our nightmares. All evil, wrapped into one.They want to get closer. See their tricks.Shit. Isn't that-With these.Don't move.Trust us. We're here to help you take these jerks.Not yet... not yet. Now!Oh shit. Abort! Abort!Run!Real as it gets... Now, Stan and Eddie!I don't wanna stay and find out.Leave us alone Bowers. I don't want anyone to get seriously hurt.Okay. Ben, we'll hold him off while we can, you and Stan see if you can find a way in.Charge!!!Guys hurry!!!Go! Go! Go!Shhhhush.What?Something's wrong with Derry. Haunting it. Hunting and killing kids. We've all seen it.Stairs.C'mon.Eddie!Eddie.We tried, we can't get down stairs.Do you see anything you could use to climb out?What do we do?Ah, fuck!Who know what's going on.Exactly. No one listened to him like no one listens to us. And unless we do something, \"IT's\" never going to stop.We can kill it.I don't think that's a choice, Stan. \"IT\" knows we know. We hurt it. It's going to want to hurt us back.We're all scared. That's what it feeds off of. I heard the clown tell Eddie as much. Our only defense is to stick together.Hey.Why? To scream at each other more?And Georgie right? You, dad, and Georgie.No. You stop. I hate it. Tip toeing around you guys like I don't exist. Like I'm the one who died and the only one who's still here is Ge--What do you care? At least she heard me.I miss Georgie, too.Do you? Because it seems like every adult in this town is blind to what's really happening, blind to what any of us kids are going through.C'mon, clown. Show your ugly face! I'll stick another firecracker in it for Georgie. Blow your whole stupid head off. Send you back to wherever a creeper like you comes from. Where are you!?Eddie? Eddie you there?Eddie? I know where to find--The sewers.\"IT.\" Whenever it shows up, there's always water around. The storm drain where Georgie died. The leak in my room. Beverly's sink.I'll bet if you trace every terrible event in Derry you'll find the same thing. Water. With the Penobscot river on one side and Kenduskeag canal cutting through it's impossible to escape.Shit, Stan's bar mitzvah. I almost forgot.You are now. Let's go!Bev. You okay?What? What did he do Beverly?Not someone. \"IT\".The sewers. Me and Mike figured it out. That's how it gets around. That's where it lives.The sewers. We go in. All of us.Get rid of \"IT\" before \"IT\" gets rid of us, one by one. It doesn't know what to do when all of us are together, you have to believe me.C'mon!We need to protect each other Stan. The seven of us is all we have. Together \"IT\" can't hurt us. I promise.I have faith. Just like you.This is our only way into Derry's original sewer system before it was sealed off and modernized.Don't look back!There's suppose to be a tunnel here. The last tunnel that's shown on the map.Keep moving!Don't jiggle it too much, whatever you do.Victor.It doesn't matter what it calls itself. What matters is it's afraid to show us what it really is. Which means we can beat it.Beverly, wait-!We all here?Guys, the island. Let's swim.Hurry!Stan what are you doing!Stan, it's us. You in there buddy?Maybe. Or just changing into something else.It's using our fears against us. It wants us to be afraid.We have to stick together, to help each other against that kind of fear you only have when you're alone. Alright?Ready?My turn.I'm not afraid of you, clown.Guys?Ahhhh!Come out from the dark then. Come out from behind that stupid mask and show me what you really are. C'mon!I'm sorry, Georgie.You're not Georgie.No! I have to think.No.I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't go out there with you. I'm sorry I was sick.Hairspray.We've got to get out of here.We'll get out.
