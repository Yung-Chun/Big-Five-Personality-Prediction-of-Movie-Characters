{"Monte-Carlo": {"ALICE": {"raw_line": "\"By tomorrow, we will have flown to France.\" She turns to face her TENTH GRADE FRENCH CLASS. Though Alice's make up, earrings and practical flats are simple, there is an inherent elegance to their combination that hints at a more complex, if uncharted, interior.Who can give me an example? Paul? NOTE: Throughout, all blocks of italicized dialogue should beC'est bon! Amber?En francais si'l vows plait?I'll see you then. Thanks. They kiss again and Richard takes off for the athletic fields, passing Meg as she comes from the school, waves.I finished our travel binders! Meg takes the binder, looks it over.Where's Emma? She knows we're meeting, right?Oh, that's right. I keep forgetting your life is completely over. So sad. I'm really going to miss you.She always looks great, doesn't she?Emma, we're a team.Look at us. Meg and Emma turn to Alice, smiling.Come on... Please... please...That's it! I am good to go!Like Christmas when I was a kid. There's no way I'm going to be able to sleep tonight--I mean, how long have I been talking about this?But, we can't even celebrate--But, I'm leaving. I'm--. I'm getting on a plane in the morning.Let's do this when I get back. In a week.Honey, listen, it's just the timing. I wasn't planning on thisAnd it's great. This is great. You're great. But, Richard, I feel like I just need to do this one thing first. Then I can do the next. Then I can do this. Can you understand? There's a world I haven't even seen yet... Alice, hopeful, searches Richard's inscrutable expression a beat, then he turns away and gets up, ring in hand.Merci .Excuse me, are you Madame Valery?Hi, my name is Alice Perry--I'm traveling with my friends, Meg Kelly and Emma Lindgard--We're so excited! Madame Valery eyes Alice unfolding a map from her binder.Now, I was hoping you could tell me which route the bus will be taking--This is ridiculous...Try to remember that! We'll double back for the Chagalls!Oh. Alice turns Meg and Emma around to come back down.What? No. I'm--. I'm just a little tired.Oh! No. Wait. Pardon, Monsieur--Pardon, Madame, but... Madam Valery slowly raises her eyes from Alice's hand.I'm sorry, but--They've taken our dinners away-- Madame Valery taps her watch and then her clipboard.Look! Look at this picture and tell me what's different!I researched at least a millionEmma, what have you got in here?It's called the Pont des Arts because the Louvre was formally known as the Palais des Arts... Madame Valery stops ahead, turning back to take in Alice and her cluster of appreciative followers.It's from right here that all the highway miles in all of France are measured. They also say that if you stand on this exact spot, you are be destined to return to France in the future.I'm sorry. I was explaining aboutWe were just on our way inside--But, we haven't been--okay. We will. I promise. But, these people haven't seen theBut, this is Notre Dame! They need to see this--I might not have ever been here before, but...You keep rushing us through, like this is some kind of race--Now, the real tour can begin!Who cares? We're in Paris! What's a little rain?Oh. Meg and Emma turn to gape as well at the DINERS and elegant tables inside as the rain hammers down.That, mes aims, is Paris.My treat.We're going to do one thing right in Paris. I don't care how much it costs. They turn for the dining room, passing the front desk where CORDELIA WINTHROP SCOTT unleashes her ire on the CONCIERGE.Emma?She should be ashamed. Can you imagine having a room here and then not staying in it? An ANXIOUS WAITER races in, refilling Alice's glass.I'm so sorry. Were we being too loud?A view! There's a view. Alice races to push back the window sheers, revealing a staggering panorama of the city, the Seine, and the Eiffel tower in the pouring rain. The entire city of light is reflected in her eyes.Wait. What are you guys doing? Emma launches herself onto the enormous bed.On what planet? Come on. We were only going to take a look!Meg! Meg takes the bottle and crawls up with Emma.Okay. But, just until it stops raining. Then we go.I did surprise her--Poor Carl and Deedee...Oh, yes. Yes...We'll be right down. Merci. She hangs up.Cordelia, your car is here.Just keep moving. The three women increase their pace, but the manager catches up to them with an express envelope.Thank you so much but I think we'llIt's fine. It's fine. We'll just have him drop us off... Alice and Meg look out the back window at the manager who waves them farewell, the doorman shooing photographers.We're going back to our hotel-- Emma holds up an itinerary with a big mischievous grin.No. We're not.Emma, for crying out loud. Meg, you want to help me out here?No, Meg, doesn't. Meg looks up from the itinerary, shrugs.Oh! And somehow that magically makes taking it right?I can think of a lot of things--Okay. We go. We take a look around. We get on a train and come right back...Go, look, come right back. It's a good plan. Alice, Meg and Emma clink glasses.Okay! What do we want to do first? Check out the palace, or the beach?Let's find a map--You are very generous, and we'd love to, but, I'm afraid Cordelia has other plans this evening-- Jean-Pierre turns, charmed by Alice's perfect French, and alarmed by this news.We're very sorry--In Africa. Meg hangs her head.Only she did. Emma reaches for a gigantic wrapped fruit basket.You, Emma. If you're Cordelia. They've seen you. You're here.Okay. But, just for tonight. And, that's it. CLICK! Alice and Meg look to Emma, holding the now open briefcase, eyes wide.Then it.all goes back.Please. I'm mooning everyone behind us.And why aren't you playing?They're playing for money?Great. I'm just--. Excuse me. Alice slips around the railing and heads for Emma as two players fold in near tears, leaving just Emma, Domenico and a DOWAGER in the game.I'm terribly sorry to interrupt. But, Cordelia, you look a little overheated... Why don't we--?Emma! That isn't Monopoly money!And this isn't the mathletes finals in Kenosha!What?!She really believes in education. The doors start to close.No. Thank you, we'll be payingNo. I'm not going to tell you what to do.Even better! Alice holds up a pair of pink satin toe shoes, swinging them from their ribbon laces.Actually, sometimes Richard and I go to Madison's on Saturdays--They've got the best music.What? Oh, yeah, of course... Meg dances by herself, having a great time, taking in the room, the music and the people, when a handsome MAN begins to match her moves, insinuates himself. She smiles but shakes her head as she moves away, turning her back to evade him. Another gorgeous MAN sidles up to Meg, joining her solo dance, wiggling his eyebrows invitingly.Say you're sorry, Cordelia.People like me?And that works? Jean-Pierre blinks, then bursts out laughing.No. I'm sorry, I didn't mean--. I've seen the pictures of the schools. The work you do isOh, brother. Meg sits further down the length of all the tables laid end to end, beside Giorgio, who has pulled his chair close, draping an arm casually across the back of hers.The stars are still out. Ahead, Emma breaks away from Penelope and Domenico, leaving the two to walk on together as she comes back toward Alice.I thought she was right behind us--We were--. We're going to watch the sunrise. Meg hesitates, turning between her friends and Bernard.The guy from the market?You know, Julia Child didn't take her first cooking class until she was thirty seven.If we were home.Okay, there's a two o'clock and a four o'clock train to--Where are you going?We need to start packing, right? If we're going back to Paris--That was the plan--We were just going to come down, take a look around and--The ones we stole a trip from? The kids who are paying for this room?So, I'm the only one worried about the fact that we're lying to everyone we've met?And now I'm apparently the only who's worried we might get caught.One of her friends is bound to find out, or her family--Penelope, could you excuse us?I won't--? Jump? Meg drops into a chair, mumbling an aside to herself.Richard...?Well, you're sure one to talk. Meg's eyes flick up to Alice.You can't even bring yourself to buy a pair of jeans anymore--No way. Not anymore I'm not. You want to go to the beach? Go to the beach. You want to go the market? Go! \"Liberte, egalite, fraternite!\"It means everyone should do exactly what they want.I just--. My guide book. She picks up her book and crosses back to the door.Oh! Carl! Deedee! Alice is surprisingly overcome and impulsively throws her arms around both of them.But, what are you doing here? How did you--?Yes. That's right.Enjoy every second of it!is Go. Go home.Don't follow me. I have no idea where I'm going... The dog cocks its head in comment.Okay? Alice turns to climb the street's incline. The dog follows.I'm open! I'm open! Alice sails down the makeshift soccer field as one of the kids passes the ball to her, chased by the others. She dodges and kicks the ball through the goal to score. Her \"team\" jumps and cheers, as do a collection of spectators who have gathered to watch this tall red headed woman in a summer dress racing around the dusty lot with a band of kids.Go! Go!I'm up! I'm up! Let's go! She sets off down the field with the kids.What's the most amazing place you've ever been?Well, Africa, then. How often do you get to go? He leads her around the maze of skylights to the front of the building that faces the sea and the lightening sky.That seems a shame...What?But--. Jean-Pierre... You don't know me.Before this, I'd never even been to France. Jean-Pierre blinks and Alice laughs, as much at herself.It's true. Just kept putting it off. Always managed to find an excuse. But, really, it was that I was afraid. That it couldn't ever live up to the France I'd imagined. And if it did... Then I'd never be able to go home.But, thank you. She turns and opens the door with her key as Jean-Pierre smiles ruefully.For everything. Alice steps into her room and closes the door.Well, I wish you were there. Or here. I wish you were here, Richard. I do... Because I keep thinking, no matter what I see, I'm only seeing half of it. Because we're not seeing it together... Meg lets herself in the front door and heads for the bedroom, stopping when she overhears Alice on the phone.I'm sorry, Richard. I hope you'll be there when I get home... Because that's all I want. Alice hangs up the phone, so lost in thought she doesn't see Meg standing at the door.Oh. Hey-- Hey! You bought the jeans! They look great--!No. It's okay. You were right-- Oh, Meg! I made a huge mistake!Richard asked me to marry him--I told him we should wait a week!I did! He surprised me!I'd imagined him asking me a million times, but then when he did, I just panicked. suddenly all I could think about was the trip.That I hadn't already been to France. It was like this wave, all the years, and chances I'd had but didn't take, they just crashed down on me: And I hadn't seen anything but the end of Lake Avenue. The only clear thought in my head was, \"this guy is so wonderful, how can he marry half a person?\"I thought he was asking me to make a choice. But, he wasn't. He wasn't doing that at all. It was me. Because I couldn't believe he loved me just for who I was. France or no.I thought we said no jewelry--The necklace, Emma! Emma's face clouds as she distractedly reaches a hand to her bare collar bone, then flicks her eyes up to Alice.Emma, where's the necklace--?Emma, help.You're first. There's a door onOne point five million Euros, Emma!For the auction, Emma!For the children--!Are you even sure you took it off?Well... Were you this close to the edge? I mean, it could've fallen--Emma, we're not talking about a pair of sunglasses!Where is he, anyway?Emma, it's your fault because you wore it in the first place!Well, we're just going to have to talk to her.Meg?Oh! Richard whips around to see Alice spread-eagled on the marble floor as Meg and Emma slide to a stop.You got my message.You went all the way to Paris?No! A misunderstanding. We're fine. She's fine.Richard, we've got to-- I can't believe you're here--!The necklace!We can explain.But, the necklace is right here--!Look, you weren't here. Everyone thought she was you--They all did. Cordelia looks at Alice a beat as this lands with her.You apologize to her right now!You know, I feel sorry for you--Because no matter where you go, no matter where you jet to in this world, you are still going to be you. And, let me tell you; she is who you want to be! The all freeze when a BANGING erupts at the door.Coming! Just a moment, please! The captain grabs the key from the clerk and turns the handle, just as Alice coolly opens the door from within.Bon jour.A terrible misunderstanding. You see, she couldn't find her necklace.When she found it--She was so happy--She said she would die. If she didn't find it--Yes! Alice turns her brightest smile to the captain.Let me just grab my purse.You okay in here? Meg sits on top of Cordelia who is tied to a chair with a scarf, the fruit-basket apple jammed in her mouth.Richard, this is Jean-Pierre, Jean- Pierre this is Richard, my fiance--Yes! He came all this way! Richard tightens his grip on Jean-Pierre's hand.I told you, that's Jean-Pierre!No. There's isn't. She leads Richard through the ballroom entrance only to be stopped by an ATTENDANT.He's with me! As Alice pulls Richard through to the ballroom, Nikolai steps to the reception table behind them, producing an elaborate invitation from inside his jacket.It's for a school, Richard--Oh,no...He means no harm--Yes?Emma! Jean-Pierre reacts to Alice's \"Emma!\" as she breaks away.Actually, it's not. Let him bid.It's true! A ripple of exclamation sweeps the dumbfounded crowd.We're not who we said we were. We're... We're only high school teachers. From Racine, Wisconsin.We'd never been anywhere. And we took a trip, that didn't belong to us... Because, well, because you thought we were... important. And that she was Cordelia... Richard smiles at Alice, supporting her with his gaze.We wanted to help.We're very sorry. And, we're willing to face the consequences, whatever they are... But... She turns to Meg and Emma as a smile blossoms.But, this was our adventure.We wouldn't change a minute of it.Emma. It's okay.He's rich.Richard...Take me home?This is for our room. And the trip down.Please.Now, Emma, you're sure about this?\"I used to wander aimlessly,/ Wanton my goal, grievous my plight./Your dear hands led me, guided me.\" Alice encircles Richard's waist as they walk, and he slings an arm around her shoulder, kisses her hair.\"Over the far horizon, night/ Glowed with the pallid hope of dawn./Your eyes' glance was my morning light.\" A YOUNG GIRL presents a length of brightly woven fabric, draping it over Emma's shoulders as Emma picks the girl up and the other children lead Emma and Nikolai inside.\"No sound - save his own tread upon/The ground - to ease the wanderer's heart./Your voice encouraged me: 'go on!\"'\"Yes, my heart - dark, cowed, set apart,/Alone - bewailed its dire distress./Sweet love, with its all- conquering art.\" The entire classroom hangs on her every word.\"Joined us as one in joyousness.\" A beat as she and her class float on the last phrase of Paul Verlaine's poem.Everyone should go.

Kyle? KYLE snaps his eyes up to Emma's face, tries to cover.Try to follow along. I really want you guys to get this! David? DAVID gazes back dumbly, stuck in an erotic fog.Cindy?Well, that was a close call! They turn to see Emma. crossing the parking lot holding a quality knock-off designer handbag over her head.Second floor girl's bathroom. Right where I left it. ThisYou guys were so nice to ask me to come with--I'd just be sitting around the condo, trolling e-Harmony...I'm telling you, it's this town!You know what we should do, Meg? When we're over there? we should all treat ourselves. Find a real salon. Total spa treatment. And I'm gonna get my hair done. Just like this! She holds up a European tabloid she's pulled from her purse,Hello. You've reached the home of Emma Lindgard. I'm afraid I won't be able to return your call right away, as I'm currently traveling. In Europe. But, please, do leave a message.Ooh! She hangs up the phone and sits herself down at the coffee table where a game of solitaire is laid next to a microwaved Lean Cuisine dinner. She turns up the volume with the remote and gathers the cards, shuffling. Eyes glued to Princess Diana on television, Emma suddenly shoots her hands three feet wide, rifling the cards in perfect vertical formation like a seasoned cardsharp.Are we there?!There it is! Esprit de Corps! Alice looks to where Emma points, seeing a small sky-blue flag at the end of a long staff held by MADAME VALERY their harried tour guide in a suit of the same blue.Well, that's great!Hey, Alice! Meg! Alice and Meg turn to Emma across the aisle, who hooks a thumb at CARL and DEEDEE beside her.Can you believe? They're from St. Paul! On their honeymoon!Alice, that's like you! We're here celebrating my friend Meg's divorce!I got it! I got it!Alice, I'll e-mail it to you. Meg looks up, catching Alice eyeing their surroundings.To Alice! They clink glasses and Alice is suddenly jostled, just as she's about to sip, by Carl as he turns from the table behind her, spilling her wine.Toujour le suck-ez vous.Five nights? Here?!Here's your outhouse, Meg. Go nuts. Alice joins Emma at the bathroom door.Me? I'm going to try to hold it.Just the stuff you put on my list-- And a couple options. The bag slips from Meg's grasp, crashing onto the foot of the bed which collapses, catapulting Alice onto the cot which flips up over her, knocking Emma into the tiny bathroom.Hey! Come on, guys!I want a picture! Of all of us! Alice looks up as Emma breaks away, to see Madam Valery leading her dwindling group from the great church. Madame Valery sends her charges to the bus, then heads straight for Alice as Emma tries to enlist a JAPANESE COUPLE to take a group photo with her camera.Ill bet she knows more about it than you! The Japanese wife frames the action with Emma's camera.What'd she say? Alice's eyes narrow in regarding Madame Valery and all fall silent a beat; a crowd anticipating fireworks. CLICK! The Japanese wife snaps a picture of the standoff, the sound of the shutter triggering Alice to action.That was fantastic!I think it's starting to rain--What're they saying?You think they'd let me use the bathroom?Wow.Meet you in there. Emma heads for the ladies room, gaping at the lobby.Wow...These are cloth! She takes the towel into one of the stalls, closing the door behind her just as Cordelia strides in, stops at the counter.Hello?Did you see those are cloth?Well, she sounded awful. And kind of mean. Alice, Meg and Emma, punchy and a little drunk, enjoy wine from enormous glasses as they finish their meals.And her trip to Monte Carlo!Our misunder--?Excuse me, Monsieur?Scheize. Alice sees but one the thing: The Eiffel tower illuminated on the other side of a bank of French doors.Now this is more like it!This is the room we were supposed to have!Alice, take a break, would you? WeI'm glad I got pictures!Really loved that flag, didn't she?Do you think that if you sleep in a bed like this every night your dreams are different? Alice rolls to her side and the view of the Eiffel tower.Like, are they bigger? You know? Do you dream a more amazing life? Meg kicks off her shoes, lets them drop.What time is it? Alice's eyes fly open as she snaps awake.We were only joking! We didn't mean to--!Alice?What?What? I want to know where we're going.No. We're going to Monte Carlo!Alice, what's \"prive?\" Is that like an airline?See? Meg wants to go. Don't you, Meg?What's the worst that could happen?Now, I like that idea, because it's true! They fall silent as the steward appears with glasses of Champagne, wait for him to retreat.Well, bon jour me.Oh, I'm sorry! This is Alice Perry and Meg Kelly. Two of my dearest friends. Visiting from America!I'll say. Emma sneakily indicates Jean-Pierre's empty ring finger to Alice and Meg as he consults his wristwatch.Invitations for the week--?His Highness?What's he saying? Which prince? Jean-Pierre looks imploringly between the three.\"With your help The Michand Foundation is able to sow the seeds of education, transforming lives, families, and villages, one child at a time...\" She didn't say anything about a school!Reykjavik! That takes some nerve! They're counting on her for a charity auction and she doesn't even show up!She did?Well, I can't go to that thing tonight.My luggage is here.Lucky guess?Don't you feel like we've won something already? Jean-Pierre comes to greet them with PRINCE DOMENICO DA SILVANO , both in tuxedos, offering a hand to escort Emma down the few steps.Enchante. Jean-Pierre assists Meg and Alice, Meg clutching the top of her dress, Alice anxiously keeping the skirt of hers in place with a hand as she steps down.Please, call me \"Cordelia.\"I shall certainly try. Domenico escorts Emma out onto the casino floor as Jean- Pierre touches Alice's elbow.Oh, but, I really wasn't planning on playing this evening. I so much prefer to watch-- Emma looks to Alice and Meg for help as Jean-Pierre leads them to the far side of a low railing to view the game.Oh. Um. Okay... She takes her handbag into her lap, opens it, looks.That is if anyone is able to make change. A beat. Jean-Pierre, Domenico and all the other players burst out laughing and Emma smiles, laughing too, but shoots a desperate look to Alice and Meg.Well... She moves her hands to the stacks and stacks of chips beside her, and pushes them to the center of the table.Relax. I've got it under control--Jean-Pierre, would you be a dear and get Alice some water?Now, go sit down and try to be cool, would you? Jeeze! Let me handle this. Alice moves back to her stool, tries to smile as she takes the water Jean-Pierre offers.After you. Please. Domenico can hardly contain his gloating as he reveals his three aces.Well. It is just a game after all. She turns her cards over and fans them on the table felt: A royal flush in the suit of hearts, ace high.I do hope there are no hard feelings. The other players cheer as Domenico's smile crashes. Emma shrieks with delight, turning to Alice and Meg who grab each other, barely keeping themselves from pitching over, glasses spilling, as the other players applaud. Emma rakes in the Everest of multi-colored chips with both arms, laughing as she's congratulated.Oh, a little, online. But, this is so much more fun!It's been such a splendid evening, I am reluctant to press my luck any further.Oh, Delmonico--I would not miss it for the world.Wait! Before Alice can respond to Jean-Pierre, Emma takes one of the buckets from Alice and hands it back to him.You must keep this one. For your foundation.But, it would be darling if you could have them sent round our hotel.But, they looked amazing on you!You wear them here! Anywhere! Alice, you tell her-- Alice opens her mouth, but stops herself as the three wander the crowded market stalls heaped with fountains of flowers in every color, breads, fresh produce, trinkets and souvenirs.Oh, Meg! Look! For Finn!How perfect is this?!Ooh! Thank you! I'm so thirsty! Nikolai remains planted, holding his tray with a smile, watching with bright eyes as Emma drinks. She lowers her glass and her full attention snags on Nikolai, really registering his presence now as she searches his warm, gentle eyes.It's a wonderful party, isn't it? Nikolai nods and offers her another glass of Champagne. Alice, dancing with Jean-Pierre, subtly repositions herself in order to keep an eye on Emma.Don't you need to, like, circulate?Really?Yes?Um. 'Course I do... Hi.Hospital? What happened?!She did that to you?Alice, no--. Wait a minute--Now, you listen to me, Penelope Penrose. You have no idea how long I've waited for this moment. Penelope flinches, preparing for a beating.But, I had no way of finding you after you left us, and...Oh, Penny. Don't you see? Don't you know that I was just jealous? Alice and Meg exchange looks.You were so smart. So clever andNo, Penny. I was ugly. I was a monster.Because, I knew I could never compete! Not with anyone as special as you.You want to know what I've waited for all these years, Penelope Penrose? Penelope shakes her head almost imperceptibly.To do this. Emma opens her arms wide and pulls Penelope into a hug. She looks at Alice and Meg over Penelope's shoulder, and then closes her eyes with genuine emotion for a beat, pulling back to smile into Penelope's grateful, tear-streaked face.Now... Friends?\"Make new friends and keep the old, one is silver and the other's gold!\" Alice and Jean-Pierre lean toward each other intimately' across the packed, lively table of PARTY-GOERS.And you're my friend...and you're my friend. . .and you're my-- She turns with the bottle to find Nikolai who has materialized beside her on the long banquette.Oh, hey! You were at the party! Do you work here, too? Nikolai cheerfully shakes his head, holds up her purse.Oh! Did I forget that? Wow, what a lifesaver! Thanks!You're not from here, are you?Where's Meg? Alice looks around and sees Giorgio walking alone among the strolling party guests.Meg! What are you doing? Come on! We're going to watch--He is so cute! And a cook--!And you're single now! Meg slows to a stop, stands a beat.But, we're not.Oh, good! I want a picture! Of the three of us! All of us! The paparazzi swarm from the steps towards Emma.By the fountain! She runs for the sprays of water, pulling Alice and Meg, and the paparazzi meet them, flashing away. Leaning against the fountain's balustrade, Emma gestures for everyone to join them.Penelope! Come on. I want one with everybody! Penelope, Domenico and Jean-Pierre join with other members of the group and Emma lines them all up.Okay! Ready? One, two--Wait! Wait! Niki! He shakes his head, bashful, but Emma gestures him over, swinging her arms wildly.Nikolai, you, too! I need all my friends--Whoops! Her feet zip out from beneath her and she sails backwards over the balustrade, reaching for Alice and Meg, pulling them with her as the camera's flash.Alice, have you seen my sandals?Train? Where are you going? Alice looks up and takes in Emma's costume.I'm going to the beach. With Penelope. Meg enters through the suite's door carrying a bakery bag.I don't know. She's talking about train schedules... Emma trails off as she and Meg and Alice look between eachBack to Paris?We're not staying for the auction?In Africa.We're rich!You're the one who said we had to go to the casino--I've got friends. The doorbell rings and they turn their heads in unison, then look to each other with sudden alarm. A beat. Emma goes to the door, finding Penelope, also dressed for the beach, who holds up the newspaper with it's fountain photo.Oh, my god! We look great! Alice, look! Alice takes the paper, Meg reading over her shoulder.Doesn't it mean we have to stay?Okay, you know what? Let's just pack. It's not fun anymore. Alice, if you think we should go, then that's what we're gonna do. You're in charge. Meg scoffs, an exasperated exhale.What does that mean? Alice snatches up her purse and heads for the door.Alice, wait! Where are you--? You're not going back to Paris--?No. I... I don't think she's 0 coming. I'm sorry.Niki. He bows slightly, offering the cake.You work here too? You never get a night off... He smiles, shaking his head, hands her the cake.Oh, Niki... I'm so glad you found me.It doesn't seem fair. Leaving you to clean up all alone.It must get kind of lonely sometimes... Not being understood.You get me.Thanks. I couldn't find--. I musta left my key someplace... But, what does it matter, really? When I already have everything I'll ever need... Alice exchanges a look with Meg as Emma swans across the suite to tear open on the fruit basket, pluck out an apple, and drape herself across a chaise.I'm in love! I am! Oh, you guys, I'm in love with Niki... Nikolai... Nikolai. And, I don't care if he is just a busboy. Or waiter. Whatever he is... Alice unfolds the paper, taking in the image of Emma wearing Cordelia's necklace.It's funny if you think about it. I could have had a prince. A real one. But, I wanted my Niki-- Hey. Why are you guys crying?No--? What jewelry?Ooh, that's a good one!The yacht! There! I left it on--!Oh, hey. What's she doing here?The roof?!I said I was sorry! You think I would have worn it if I knew how much it cost? Busy fighting, none of them notice as Nikolai's boat passes fifty feet off their side.None of us knew that, Alice--In Africa. I know!Well, sit down then! Nikolai's wake hits the dinghy, rocking them hard.It was right here!Definite \"yes.\"0 You know, I'm getting a little tired of this. Just because IAlright. Fine.He just works here. I don't-- You don't think he could have taken it, do you?He works like fifteen jobs already! You don't know what it's like being around rich people all the time--Yeah, we'll just explain.You never know. She might understand.Wow! Richard! Richard drops down to help Alice as she struggles up, dizzily finding her feet to stand.Hey, Francois! How are you--?Super fine.It'll just take a minute! We'll have her right back!Boy! Does he love you.Niki!Oh, Niki! I knew it! I knew it! I believed in you the whole time!Wait for me in the lobby, sweetie. Down in half a second--I know. Me, too. The doors close and Emma sprints back down the hall to Alice and Meg at the door.Okay! Do it! Alice rings the bell.The police--?And, we dry-cleaned the dresses-- Meg and Alice wince, look daggers at Emma.Well... For the children.But, that's not fair! It's not theWell, look at you!You mean miserable? Cordelia blinks.Or a petty, spoiled, selfish--Bitch! Cordelia slaps Emma across the face. Alice and Meg gasp and they all stand a beat in shock.The police?Oh, no! This is going to be so embarrassing. Please tell me you didn't run all the way over here just for me.Yes, but, Jean-Pierre, would you be a dear and help me? I can't seem to manage the clasp. Jean-Pierre senses something amiss, but steps to assist Emma.Relieved! I screamed with delight.The necklace!Extremely! Think of all the schools we'll build! Do you like it?Oh, but, yes! Would you? What an entrance I'll make! So dramatic!Niki, I'm sorry. It's just going to another minute.Perfect! That sounds good. Emma is led to the ballroom by the captain as Richard meets Alice and Jean-Pierre in the center of the lobby.Niki. What are you doing?Well, don't. Just stop, okay?No! No. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm terribly sorry, but, there's..Put your hand down, and I'll be done in a second. Then we can go.Alice, he doesn't understand. It's like a foreign language to him--But, he'll get in trouble--Nikolai! You cannot bid against yourself!No! Stop! Stop! I'm sorry. I can't... I cannot allow this sweet, wonderful man to buy this necklace, because... It is not mine to sell.Merde. Richard, Jean-Pierre, Penelope, and Domenico all swing between the two \"Cordelias,\" as Meg makes her way forward with Bernard.Not for anything in the world. Richard takes the pulse of the frighteningly still crowd, the, hesitating police, the charged air in the room.Penny, you don't have to...Nikolai! No...How? How can it be okay?Niki? What's going on?I'll call you both as soon as I know. They may have to get a sub at school for a couple of weeks, but, oh, you guys, I swear it sounded like a proposal!

The class bell RINGS!You can burn the school down as soon as we're back.Remind me again why we're taking phonebooks to France? Alice gives her a look.I love my binder. I do.Forgot her purse.You know, for the first time in a long time, I feel just as lucky as any of these kids. They may have their whole lives ahead of them but we've got a week in Paris.Funny.Look at her. The only teacher in Racine County that wears four inch heels in six feet of snow.Where'd you find it?The fact that you have trouble finding a date--Gives me less than no hope.Finn, if Edith goes to Paris with me, she can't go to Daddy's with you. Finn's brows come together as she considers this, then reaches for the dog.That's what I thought.Toothbrush? Seamus makes a face, drops his bag and heads back up the stairs as the doorbell rings.You and me? Or...At least she's smiling.To jet lag. Emma and Alice raise their glasses to toast as WAITERS plunk down identical plates of steak frites before them.To Alice. Best organizer. Best guide. Best friend.Are you apologizing?Well. This is the one we could afford. A beat as they consider the room and their lot in life.It's only five nights--And, Alice, you said yourself, we'll hardly ever be in our room.Okay, Emma. Let's just unpack-- she turns for the luggage, nearly falling over at the weight of Emma's suitcase as she reaches to lift it.Holy--! Alice, help-- Alice climbs onto one of the beds to help Meg lift.Oh, I'm in! Come on. Everyone! Together, they all step forward, arms entwined, laughing.You tell her, Carl.\"A\" plus! Alice, cheeks flushed, watches Carl waving goodbye from theAlice, you okay? Alice brings the staff down across her knee, snapping it in two, casting the broken ends into the gutter as she raises herself to her full height.Let's kick this town's ass! Alice marches forward as a few drops of rain fall.Get us a table? Alice, we can't afford to eat here--No, Emma, I mean, exactly like you.We should just take it. Her room.Alice, how fast can you get a binder going on a trip like that?What's so funny about that? We got in here.Emma, you could be her!There's whole other room in here!So, we're looking. And we like what we see.Alice, how many do chances do we get? For something like this? Alice considers, looks out the window at the streaming rain.Agreed. Alice climbs up and together, the three pass the bottle of Champagne as they study the ceiling's ornate plasterwork.Surprised me!Well... We'll never know. Seen from the bed, the light atop the Eiffel tower breaks through the dissipating clouds to swing a searching arc through the night sky...We'll tell them it was a mistake!Take it. Just take it.They really do think she's her... RIP! Alice and Meg spin to Emma as she spills the envelope 's contents.Hold on... I'm reading...Trip's paid for, whether that girl takes it or not.You're in charge. You want to go back to that hotel, okay by me. A beat while Alice looks between Meg and Emma, trapped.Anything goes wrong, we say it was a language thing, that we didn'tWe won't keep you--No, I can't. I can't stand it. Emma reads to Alice and Meg from the brochure in the seating area of their luxurious suite, enjoying none of it, nor the incredible balcony view of Monte Carlo's marina and bay.Schools, with an \"s.\" More than one.That horrible, irresponsible girl! I've never stolen a thing in my life, now I've taken a trip from school children.Do not touch that!Dry-cleaned.I may as well be topless.A riot. Domenico casts a glossy chip into the pot.I should probably keep this.What'd she say? What'd she say?Yeah. Good call, Cordelia. DING! The elevator arrives and the doors open as Domenico leans in towards Emma.Great meeting you, your Highness. Good times. Really. Jean-Pierre places his buckets in Alice's hands, a certain frisson to the simple exchange.Wait. You know what, on second thought, I'm not getting these-- She pulls the pair of jeans from her pile of clothes.Where was I ever going to wear them? Seriously?Thank you. It's silly, anyway. They're just jeans. I want to find something for the kids--Oh, no. No. I'm sorry. I'd like to. But... The woman is confused, vaguely insulted.I don't have a kitchen. No place to cook.Well, thank you... She smiles at the woman and starts to walk away, only to findFrom Wisconsin. Yes. Bernard reaches a handkerchief from his jacket for Meg.I try. But... We don't have even half of this at home. She points to a tray of miniature lobsters.Like those. I've only seen them in magazines.I'd go for a saute, being a Midwestern gal.So, you cook. Bernard dips his head modestly.Meg. Kelly. Thank you again forI need to find my--. . My friends are around here somewhere...Yeah. But, I'm gonna walk myself. Thanks, though. She slips into the moving crowd, leaving Bernard to watch as she meets Alice and Emma further up the street. He holds a beat, then turns when called to by a vendor.Alice, she's fine...The gay bar?I am so butting in on that. Alice laughs and spins, crashing directly into Jean-Pierre.No, thanks. She moves off only to be met by GIORGIO who smoothly steps in.What? That's awful!Okay, wait. You're a man, right?Yeah, I know: I'm funny. But, see if you can answer something for me. Ten years you're married, to the girl you dated in high school. I'm talking the girl you lost your virginity to, the one who gave you two great kids that you're just crazy about. Then one morning, what? You wake up, and out of the blue, it's like, \"Oh, hey, honey, I think I'm in love with this other woman...\"I thought I was his partner. Giorgio takes Meg hand, more in comfort than come on.I feel like I failed.Oh, I'm sorry, 'I didn't order-- She looks up to find Bernard standing in chef's whites.Adding the fresh orange; nice. Bernards nods, accepting the compliment.But, a little fennel would've been \"wow.\"Chef .We'd be getting up now.Breakfast is here! There's this fantastic bakery around the corner. I've already had three brioche. And I saw the greatest little shop for the kids, but they weren't openWhat plan?That was before we knew it was for a charity. Remember the kids?Alice, what's with you? We'll pay for the room--Lying? To who? Jean-Pierre?She's in Iceland.What friends?Oh, this is so typical. Just because it's not on your map, 'cause you didn't plan it--. We all agree to take this adventure and then you won't jump.Now I know how Richard must feel. Alice comes to a full stop and gapes at Meg, stung.Exactly.Don't look at me like that. The door opens, and Alice re-enters, striding across the room for the desk, not looking at either Emma or Meg.Just one. He leads her to a table along the wall and holds out a chair. Seated, Meg follows him with her eyes to the kitchen where Bernard works furiously at the stove, tossing the contents of a sauce pan with an expert flick of his wrist. Bernard glances out to the dining room, seeming to sense Meg before knowing he'll find her there.Seamus. He's ten. Built a website for his fourth grade class. Now he's got actual clients. And that's Finn, the prima ballerina. She'll be six in June-- Emile examines photographs of Seamus and Charlotte from Meg's wallet while she refills their glasses at the kitchen table and Bernard works at the stove.Oh, she's no chicken. She's not scared of anything--But, that's a nice word for it.Yeah. No. No way. Bernard straddles a beat up moped, motor running, as Meg shakes her head emphatically.What do you want me to tell you? I'm not getting on that thing. Bernard fixes her with a level look, which Meg mimics.Hold on.How do you say \"faster?\"Thank your father for me?Thank you. Meg hugs him briefly, awkwardly, then turns for the steps.Alice, I am so sorry! For what I said. About you. And Richard. I didn't mean any of it! I love you. I don't know how I would've gotten through the past six months if it weren't for you--Wha--?Wait. What? When?No. You didn't--Alice...But, Alice. You were going. We were on our way.Honey, Richard knows you... It might feel like it's over. But,I'm trying to follow you--What? Alice holds up the newspaper.Are you kidding me?!They're locked!No. Forget it. Alice laces her fingers together, turning to Emma.Why'd they have to park so far out, anyway?!What am I going to tell my kids?! How am I'm going to explain to Glenn that we're in a French jail?My kids'll be in college when we get out! They won't even know me.Trespassing. Burglary. Oh, god. Grand larceny, by trick andI'm standing in a stolen boat!Oh, I can't believe this... Meg doubles over, hands on her knees as Emma stands over the empty spot on the landing.Do not even say it!We don't have time for this! Let's just split up! Alice you go fore, Emma take the aft, and I'll check the cabin. Emma glares at Alice with steely, narrowed eyes.Nice boat. No necklace.Who knows?! I mean, is there anyone who understands a word he says?!Actually, we do.Oh, yeah, that was the first thing that struck me about her. How reasonable she seemed--We should have sailed that yacht right back to Wisconsin--You think she'd fit in one of those trunks of hers--?Just thinking out loud.Longer in France.Don't worry about a thing!Don't touch that bell! They race down the hall towards Nikolai, who gapes, perplexed by the sight of Emma.Security, Madame.We haven't taken anything--In Africa.Every one of them.I don't.We're great. But, now you can addBelieve me, nothing would make me happier than having a little talk with your father-- Both their heads swing toward the door when the bell RINGS! Meg jumps to Cordelia, stuffing the apple in her mouth just as she opens it to scream.Bernard...? He holds out the bottle of wine.Oh, I... She glances back into the room behind her, carefully obscuring Bernard's view through the half open door.No. No, Bernard, that's not it.I'd invite you in, but--No. Bernard, wait-- CLICK! Meg and Bernard both turn their heads to look down the corridor when Cordelia sticks her head out the bedroom door into the hall. A beat as Cordelia and Meg lock eyes. DING! The elevator doors open at the end of the hall, closer to Cordelia. She looks back at Meg for an instant then bolts as Meg leaps past Bernard into the hall.Hey! Stop!Bernard, you should stop. You really don't need this. I may be going away for a long time--Something like that. Look, this is where we should say \"au revoir.\" Bernard smiles and pulls Meg to him, kisses her.Oh, shhhh--And it was an excellent one.Oh, good. I could use a drink.The rest is for the schools. Jean-Pierre hesitates in accepting the envelope, but Alice presses it on him.You come to Wisconsin, we'll drink this in my kitchen.", "clean_line": "favor let try vacation class bell rings burn school
