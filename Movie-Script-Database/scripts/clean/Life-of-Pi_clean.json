{"Life-of-Pi": {"ADULT PI": {"raw_line": "Born and raised in Pondicherry, in what was the French part of India. My father owned the zoo, and I was delivered on short notice by a herpetologist who was there to check on the Bengal Monitor Lizard.Mother and I were both healthy...but the poor lizard escaped and was trampled by a frightened cassowary...The way of karma; the way of God.Oh, far from it. I was named after a swimming pool.You see, my uncle, Francis, was born with too much water in his lungs. They say the doctor swung Francis around by the ankles to clear the water out and that's what gave him the huge chest and skinny legs that made him such a great swimmer.I trained with him three times a week at the ashram. His lessons would save my life in the end...I hope you don't mind vegetarian.Hmm?I got it from something Mamaji once told my father. Most travelers collect postcards or teacups on their journeys - but not Mamaji. Mamaji collects swimming pools.He swims in every pool he comes upon...One day Mamaji said to my father that of all the pools in the world, the most beautiful was a public pool in Paris. That the water there was so clear you could make your morning coffee with it, that a single swim there changed his life.Before I was born, he said to my father, \"If you want your son to have a clean soul, you must take him one day to swim in the Piscine Molitor.\" I never understood why my father took this so much to heart...... but he did, and I was named \"Piscine Molitor Patel.\"Imagine me trying to explain that name to my schoolmates. I barely made it to the age of eleven before...With one word my name went from an elegant French swimming pool to a stinking Indian latrine. I was Pissing everywhere.Even the teachers started doing it - not deliberately, of course...When we returned the next year for our first day of school, I was prepared.Well, no. Not quite ...But I still had the whole day ahead of me. French Class was next...Then Geography...My last class of the day was Mathematics....By the end of that day, I was Pi Patel, school legend.I don't even know how to sail. And I wasn't alone out there. Richard Parker was with me.So what were you doing in Pondicherry?By the way, I enjoyed your first book. The new one, is it set in India?Ah. Well, I look forward to reading it.I'm sorry.Yeah, Mamaji. He does that.I haven't spoken about Richard Parker in so many years... What has Mamaji already told you?He would say that about a nice meal. As for God, I can only tell you my story; you will decide for yourself what you believe.Let's see, then - where to begin?Pondicherry is the \"French Riviera of India.\" In the streets closest to the ocean, you might think you were in the South of France.A few blocks inland, there's a canal; just beyond that is Indian Pondicherry...And the Muslim Quarter is just to the West.When the French handed Pondicherry back to us in 1954, the town decided that some sort of commemoration was in order.My father, who was a clever businessman, came up with one.He ran a hotel, and he got the idea to open a zoo in the local Botanical Gardens instead.As it also happened, my mother was a botanist in the Gardens. They met, married, and a year later my brother Ravi was born. I came two years after that.Amen. Let's eat.Catholic Hindus do.We get to feel guilty before hundreds of gods instead of just one.The gods were my superheroes growing up. Hanuman, the monkey god, lifting an entire mountain to save his friend Lakshmana. Ganesh, the elephantheaded, risking his life to defend the honor of his mother Parvati. Vishnu, the Supreme Soul, the source of all things. Vishnu sleeps, floating on the shoreless cosmic ocean and we are the stuff of his dreaming.My dear 'Appa' believed himself part of the 'new India.' As a child, he'd had polio; he used to lie in bed, wracked with pain, wondering where God was. In the end, God didn't save him; Western medicine did.My 'Amma' went to college and thought her family was part of the 'new India' as well - until her parents cut her off because they thought she was marrying beneath her. Her religion was the only link she had to her past.I met Christ in the mountains when I was 12. We were visiting relatives, tea growers in Munnar. It was our third day there; Ravi and I were terribly bored.That made no sense. Sacrificing the innocent to atone for the sins of the guilty? What kind of love is that?But this Son - I couldn't get Him out of my head.The more I listened to the priest, the more I came to like this Son of God.I came to faith through Hinduism and I found God's love through Christ, but God wasn't finished with me yet.God works in mysterious ways - and so it was He introduced Himself again, this time by the name of Allah.And a Hindu, of course.Oh, well, I do teach a course on the Kabbalah at the University. And why not? Faith is a house with many rooms.Plenty. On every floor. Doubt is useful. It keeps faith a living thing. After all, you can't know the strength of your faith until it's been tested.He got his name through a clerical error. A hunter caught him drinking from a stream when he was a cub and named him Thirsty. When Thirsty got too big, the hunter sold him to our zoo - but the names got switched on the paperwork. The hunter was listed as Thirsty and tiger was called Richard Parker. We laughed about it and the name stuck.Things changed after the day of Appa's lesson. The world had lost some of its enchantment. School was a bore - nothing but facts, fractions and French. Words and patterns that went on and on. I grew restless, searching for something that would bring meaning into my life. And then I met Anandi...Mother made me study music, and one day my teacher came down with the flu; he asked if I could take his place one afternoon playing rhythms for a dance class.It takes a lot of work to sell a zoo; before we left Anandi and I had time enough to break each other's hearts. Of course, I promised I'd come back one day... It's funny... I remember everything else about our last day, but I don't remember saying goodbye...My father was a businessman - he had never handled the animals himself. I realized that leaving India must have been harder for him than it was for me.Have I forgotten anything?Yes. Now we have to send our boy into the middle of the Pacific, andYes. We'll get there.It was four days out of Manila - above the Mariana Trench, the deepest spot on earth...Our ship, the Tsimtsum, pushed on, bullishly indifferent to its surroundings. It moved with the slow, massive confidence of a continent.Don't you see, the island was carnivorous.Yes, the whole island - the plants, the water in those pools, the very ground itself. During the day, those pools held fresh water, but at night, some chemical process turned the water in those pools into acid - acid that dissolved those fish, that sent the meerkats scurrying into the trees and Richard Parker running to the boat.Years ago, some poor fellow just like me must have found himself stranded on that island.... And like me he thought he might stay there forever. But all that the island gave him by day, it took away again by night. To think - how many hours spent with only meerkats for company? How much loneliness taken on?All I know is that eventually he died, and the island digested him, leaving behind only his teeth. I saw how my life would end if I stayed on that island. Alone and forgotten. I had to go back to the world, or die trying.I spent the next day preparing the boat. I filled my stores with fresh water, ate seaweed until my stomach could take no more, and brought as many meerkats as I could fit into the storage locker for Richard Parker. I couldn't leave without him, of course - it would mean killing him. And so I waited for his return. I knew he wouldn't be late.By the time we reached the Mexican shore, I was afraid to let go of the boat. My strength was gone. I was so weak. I was afraid that in two feet of water, so close to deliverance, I would drown. I struggled to shore and fell upon the sand. It was warm and soft, like pressing my face against the cheek of God. And somewhere two eyes were smiling at having me there.I was so spent I couldn't move. And so Richard Parker went ahead of me.He stretched his legs and walked along the shore.At the edge of the jungle, he stopped. I was certain he was going to look back at me, flatten his ears to his head, growl - that he'd bring our relationship to an end in some way. But he just stared ahead into the jungle.And then Richard Parker, my fierce companion, the terrible one who kept me alive, disappeared forever from my life.After a few hours, a member of my own species found me. He left and returned with a group who carried me away.I wept like a child, not because I was overwhelmed at having survived, although I was. I was weeping because Richard Parker left me so... unceremoniously. It broke my heart.You know, my father was right. Richard Parker never saw me as his friend. After all we'd been through, he didn't even look back. But I have to believe that there was more in his eyes than my own reflection staring back at me. I know I felt it - even if I can't prove it. I just wish... You know, I've left so much behind. My family, the zoo, Anandi, India - I suppose in the end the whole of life becomes an act of letting go. But what always hurts the most is not taking the moment to say goodbye. I was never able to thank my father for all I learned from him, to tell him that without his lessons I would never have survived... And I know he's a tiger, but I wish I'd said: 'It's over. We've survived. Thank you for saving my life. I love you, Richard Parker. You will always be with me. May God be with you.'Hard to believe, isn't it?If it happened, it happened. Why should it have to mean anything?I was the only one who survived the shipwreck, so the Japanese shipping company sent two men to talk to me in the Mexican hospital where I was recovering. I still have a copy of their report.They had insurance claims to settle, and they wanted to find out why the ship sank. They didn't believe me either.I told him another story. Four of us survived...After that, no more questions. The investigators didn't seem to like the story, exactly - but they thanked me, they wished me well, and they left.Can I ask you something?I've told you two stories about what happened out on the ocean. Neither explains what caused the sinking of the ship, and no one can prove which story is true and which is not. In both stories, the ship sinks, my family dies, and I suffer.So which story do you prefer?Thank you. And so it goes with God.Of course. Isn't that why Mamaji sent you here, after all?My wife is here. Would you like to stay for dinner? She's an incredible cook.And a cat, and two children.Well, that's up to you. The story's yours now.", "clean_line": "born raised pondicherry french india father owned zoo delivered short notice herpetologist check bengal monitor lizard mother healthy poor lizard escaped

PI.None of us knows God until someone introduces us. I was first introduced to God as a Hindu. There are 330 million gods in the Hindu religion - how can I not come to know a few of them?I met Krishna first......But he didn't!What?Why would a god do that? Why would he send his own son to suffer for the sins of ordinary people?If God is so perfect and we're not, why would He want to create all this? Why does He need us at all?Thank you, Vishnu, for introducing me to Christ.Why not?I would like to be baptized.Stop worrying. I have seen him do this a thousand times. I want to meet our new tiger.Hello! Richard Parker!I want to see him close up.That's it, Richard Parker. It's for you.I just wanted to say 'Hello' to him.Animals have souls. I've seen it in their eyes.I'm sorry. I was...What?What does this mean?In the dance, you went from Pataka, which means the forest, and then you did-then you did Samputa, which means something that is hidden, and after that you did this... and then you did Chatura.But at the very end you did this... None of the other dancers did that. What did you mean? The God of love is hiding in the forest?The lotus flower is hiding in the forest? Why would a lotus flower hide in the forest?And this is Richard Parker. He's the most magnificent creature we've ever had here. Look at the way he's turning his head. Showing off - like a dancer.Sorry. You've been...I'm sorry... what are we talking about?What??But where would we go? Our life is here Appa!But Columbus was looking for India!Why give O.J. a tranquilizer? She's not going to cause any trouble.Ravi? Did you hear that? Ravi?It's a thunderstorm!

SOMEBODY HELP ME!!Please save my family!You have to help them, please! Oh no my family, please. You have to help them, my family is back there.Who let all the animals out?No wait!

They'll all be here soon.HELLO...! HELLO...! ANYBODY?No! Stop it! Stop it! No! Stop it! Stop it! NO!!! NO!!! NO!!!I'm sorry, O.J.; I don't have any seasickness medicine for you -Supplies! Ah, supplies!YES!NO!! NO!! NO!! NO!!Come on! Come on!! COME ON...!!!\"My name is Pi Patel. I have been in a shipwreck. I am on a lifeboat alone - with a tiger. Please send help.\"God... I give myself to you. I am your vessel. Whatever comes... I want to know. Show me.There are no lines!\"Few things can sap the spirit faster than seasickness. Waves are more strongly felt when a boat turns sideways to the current. A sea anchor is used as a drag to keep the boat's head to the wind.Proper use of them can increase control and reduce seasickness during rough seas...For castaways who must share their lifeboats with large dangerous carnivores it's advisable to establish a territory as your own. The following course of action is recommended. Step one: choose a day when waves are moderate but regular. Step two: with the lifeboat facing into the waves, making the ride as comfortable as possible, blow your whistle soothingly. Step three: turn the lifeboat sideways to the waves, accompanied by harsh aggressive use of the whistle. With sufficient repetition, the animal will associate the sound of the whistle with the discomfort of seasickness. Similar methods have long been used by circus trainers, though they generally lack access to rough seas.Let the trumpets blare, let the drum rolls begin! Prepare to be amazed! Here it is, for your enjoyment and instruction, the show you've been waiting for all your life will soon begin!Are you ready for the miracle of it? Well, then - I give to you...... the ASTOUNDING BENGAL TIGER!Hello, Richard Parker. Sorry about the choppy ride.MINE! YOU UNDERSTAND? YOURS - MINE! You understand?Step four: disregard steps one through three.Here, Richard Parker. I've got some water for you.In the zoo, we fed our tigers an average of five kilos of meat a day. Richard Parker will be getting hungry soon.Tigers are powerful swimmers, and, if he gets hungry enough, I'm afraid the little bit of water between us won't be any protection. I need to find a way to feed him. God made tigers carnivores, so I must learn to catch fish. If I don't, I'm afraid his last meal will be a skinny vegetarian boy.Patience!What am I doing?Wait - I'm thinking.I'm sorry. I'm sorry.Thank you, Lord Vishnu. Thank you for coming in the form of a fish and saving our lives. Thank you...Of course, I brought all the biscuits and water on the raft with me to keep them safe. Idiot.Here, it's yours.I can't risk my life every time I have to climb onto the boat for supplies. It's time to settle this. If we're going to live together, we have to learn to communicate.Maybe Richard Parker cannot be tamed, but with God's will, he can be trained.NO!Good.Go Richard Parker. Go. Go on home; I'll leave you alone. I'll respect that. I promise. Go, c'mon.Yes!Dolphins, Richard Parker!Hey! HEY!! WE'RE HERE!! OVER HERE!!...645682948602814931815602496...What are you looking at...?

This is my bed!RICHARD PARKER!No one has ever seen that floating island since; you won't read about those trees in any nature book. And yet if I hadn't found those shores, I would have died. And if I hadn't discovered that tooth, I would have been lost, alone forever.Even when God seemed to have abandoned me, He was watching.
