{"Pulp-Fiction": {"JULES": {"raw_line": "\u0096 Okay now, tell me about the hash bars?Well, hash is legal there, right?Those are hash bars?That did it, man \u0096 I'm fuckin' goin', that's all there is to it.What?Examples?They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?What'd they call it?Royale with Cheese. What'd they call a Big Mac?Le Big Mac. What do they call a Whopper?What?Goddamn!Uuccch!We should have shotguns for this kind of deal.Three or four.I'm not sure.It's possible.Mia.I dunno, however people meet people. She usta be an actress.I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.Well, you know the shows on TV?Yes, but you're aware that there's an invention called television, and on that invention they show shows?Well, the way they pick the shows on TV is they make one show, and that show's called a pilot. And they show that one show to the people who pick the shows, and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they want to make more shows. Some get accepted and become TV programs, and some don't, and become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half- black, half-Samoan, usta call him Tony Rocky Horror.I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat. He's got a weight problem. What's the nigger gonna do, he's Samoan.Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up good. And word around the campfire, it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.No no no no no no no, nothin' that bad.He gave her a foot massage.Sent a couple of guys over to his place. They took him out on the patio of his apartment, threw his ass over the balcony. Nigger fell four stories. They had this garden at the bottom, enclosed in glass, like one of them greenhouses \u0096 nigger fell through that. Since then, he's kinda developed a speech impediment.Whaddya mean?You don't think he overreacted?It was a foot massage, a foot massage is nothing, I give my mother a foot massage.Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right there. Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' a bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fuckin' thing.It ain't no ballpark either. Look maybe your method of massage differs from mine, but touchin' his lady's feet, and stickin' your tongue in her holyiest of holyies, ain't the same ballpark, ain't the same league, ain't even the same fuckin' sport. Foot massages don't mean shit.Don't be tellin' me about foot massages \u0096 I'm the foot fuckin' master.Shit yeah. I got my technique down man, I don't tickle or nothin'.Fuck you.Fuck you.Man, you best back off, I'm gittin' pissed \u0096 this is the door.What time is it?It ain't quite time, let's hang back.Look, just because I wouldn't give no man a foot massage, don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass- motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. That ain't right, man. Motherfucker do that to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'd kill'a motherfucker.That's an interesting point, but let's get into character.Mia. Why you so interested in big man's wife?Take care of her?You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date?Hey kids.How you boys doin'?Am I trippin', or did I just ask you a question.Do you know who we are?We're associates of your business partner Marsellus Wallace, you remember your business partner dont'ya?Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here: you're Brett, right?I thought so. Well, you remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace, dont'ya Brett?Good for you. Looks like me and Vincent caught you at breakfast, sorry 'bout that. What'cha eatin'?Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast. What kinda hamburgers?No, I mean where did you get'em? MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the- Box, where?Big Kahuna Burger. That's that Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they got some tasty burgers. I ain't never had one myself, how are they?Mind if I try one of yours?Yours is this one, right?Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger. Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna Burger?You wanna bite, they're real good.Well, if you like hamburgers give 'em a try sometime. Me, I can't usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian. Which more or less makes me a vegetarian, but I sure love the taste of a good burger. You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France?Tell 'em, Vincent.Royale with Cheese, you know why they call it that?Check out the big brain on Brett. You'a smart motherfucker, that's right. The metric system. What's in this?Sprite, good, mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down with?Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot! You, Flock of Seagulls, you know what we're here for?Then why don't you tell my boy here Vince, where you got the shit hid.\u0096 I don't remember askin' you a goddamn thing. You were sayin'?We happy?Vincent!We happy?My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin' your ass outta this shit.Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your concentration? I didn't mean to do that. Please, continue. I believe you were saying something about \"best intentions.\"Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through anyway. Well, let me retort. Would you describe for me what Marsellus Wallace looks like?What country you from!\"What\" ain't no country I know! Do they speak English in \"What?\"English-motherfucker-can-you-speak- it?Then you understand what I'm sayin'?Now describe what Marsellus Wallace looks like!Say \"What\" again! C'mon, say \"What\" again! I dare ya, I double dare ya motherfucker, say \"What\" one more goddamn time!Now describe to me what Marsellus Wallace looks like!\u0096 go on!\u0096 does he look like a bitch?!Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!Then why did you try to fuck 'im like a bitch?!Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck 'im. You ever read the Bible, Brett?There's a passage I got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17. \"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.\"You ever read the Bible, Brett?There's a passage I got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17. \"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men...\"\"...blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherded the weak through the valley of darkness. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.\"Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.We should be fuckin' dead right now. Did you see that gun he fired at us? It was bigger than him.We should be fuckin' dead!That shit wasn't luck. That shit was somethin' else.That was... divine intervention. You know what divine intervention is?Yeah, man, that's what is means. That's exactly what it means! God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do that! Don't blow this shit off! What just happened was a fuckin' miracle!Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just happen.We should be fuckin' dead now, my friend! We just witnessed a miracle, and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge it!If you wanna play blind man, then go walk with a Shepherd. But me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.That's it for me. For here on in, you can consider my ass retired.Don't blaspheme!\u0096 I said don't do that \u0096I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm through.Don't worry, I will.I don't give a damn if he does.What the fuck's happening?Why the fuck did you do that?I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in my time \u0096The car didn't hit no motherfuckin' bump!Look at this mess! We're drivin' around on a city street in broad daylight \u0096Well you better be thinkin' about it now, motherfucker! We gotta get this car off the road. Cops tend to notice shit like you're driving a car drenched in fuckin' blood.This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus don't got no friendly places in the Valley.A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.On the other side of the hill, by Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't know what the fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any other partners in 818. Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules. Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are in some serious shit. We're in a car we gotta get off the road, pronto! I need to use your garage for a couple hours.We gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this Jimmie's situation. He's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door.Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made a couple phone calls. But I never want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's my friend and you don't bust in your friend's house and start tellin' 'im what's what.Put yourself in his position. It's eight o'clock in the morning. He just woke up, he wasn't prepared for this shit. Don't forget who's doin' who a favor.What the fuck did you just do to his towel?You're supposed to wash 'em first.I watched you get 'em wet.I used the same soap you did and when I dried my hands, the towel didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who cares? But it's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a boil. If he were to come in here and see that towel like that... I'm tellin' you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie on account of you... Look, I ain't threatenin' you, I respect you an' all, just don't put me in that position.Jules, you ask me nice like that, no problem. He's your friend, you handle him.Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda been satisfied with freeze-dried Tasters Choice. You spring this gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What flavor is this?What?Jimmie \u0096Naw man, I didn't.Why?Jimmie \u0096That's all we want. We don't wanna fuck up your shit. We just need to call our people to bring us in.You got to appreciate what an explosive element this Bonnie situation is. If she comes home from a hard day's work and finds a bunch of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta' shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin' what she's apt to do.I don't wanna hear about no motherfuckin' \"ifs.\"What I wanna hear from your ass is: \"you ain't got no problems, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in there, chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry, which should be comin' directly.\"You sendin' The Wolf?Shit Negro, that's all you had to say.Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.Hey man, as far as I know, the motherfucker's tip-top.It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your help is definitely appreciated.I will never forgive your ass for this shit. This is some fucked-up repugnant shit!Man, get outta my face with that shit! The motherfucker who said that never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull with his fingers on account of your dumb ass.You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker! Every time my fingers touch brain I'm \"SUPERFLY T.N.T,\" I'm the \"GUNS OF NAVARONE.\" I'm what Jimmie Walker usta talk about. In fact, what the fuck am I doin' in the back? You're the motherfucker should be on brain detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin' windows and you're pickin' up this nigger's skull.This morning air is some chilly shit.Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid like puttin' that out in front of your house for Elmo the garbage man to take away.Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!Ha ha ha. They're your clothes, motherfucker.Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert on wearin' dorky shit that your is.Don't do shit unless \u0096Unless you do it first.We cool?Inglewood.Mr. Wolf.I was a pleasure watchin' you work.Wanna share a cab?Sure.Naw, I don't eat pork.I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig on swine.They're filthy animals. I don't eat filthy animals.A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie. I'll never know 'cause even if it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't wanna eat nothin' that ain't got enough sense to disregard its own feces.I don't eat dog either.I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty. But a dog's got personality. And personality goes a long way.We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.I just been sittin' here thinkin'.The miracle we witnessed.Do you know that a miracle is?What's an act of God?Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't matter. You're judging this thing the wrong way. It's not about what. It could be God stopped the bullets, he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge shit like this based on merit. Whether or not what we experienced was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant. What is significant is I felt God's touch, God got involved.That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I don't know why. But I can't go back to sleep.The life, most definitely.That's what I've been sitting here contemplating. First, I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.You know, like Caine in \"KUNG FU.\" Just walk from town to town, meet people, get in adventures.Until God puts me where he want me to be.If it takes forever, I'll wait forever.I'll just be Jules, Vincent \u0096 no more, no less.Look my friend, this is just where me and you differ \u0096All shapes and sizes, Vince.If you find my answers frightening, Vincent, you should cease askin' scary questions.My boss' dirty laundry.When he wants it clean.Funny, I've been thinkin' the same thing.'Fraid I can't do that.Yes, you did.I don't mean to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time I've had gun pointed at me.Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat man, this ain't any of your goddamn business!You win.It's all yours, Ringo.Tell that bitch to be cool! Say, bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!Tell her it's gonna be okay.Promise her.Tell her to chill.What's her name?So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna do anything stupid, are we?Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're gonna be like three Fonzies. And what' Fonzie like?C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?Correct-amundo! And that's what we're gonna be, we're gonna be cool. Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three and I want you to let go your gun and lay your palms flat on the table. But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?One... two... three.Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be cool. When you yell at me, it makes me nervous. When I get nervous, I get scared. And when motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers get accidentally shot.That seems to be the situation. Now I don't want that and you don't want that and Ringo here don't want that. So let's see what we can do. Now this is the situation. Normally both of your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken. But you happened to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period. I don't wanna kill ya, I want to help ya. But I'm afraid I can't give you the case. It don't belong to me. Besides, I went through too much shit this morning on account of this case to just hand it over to your ass.It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's cool baby, nothin's changed. We're still just talkin'. Tell her we're still cool.Nothin' I can't handle. I want you to just hang back and don't do shit unless it's absolutely necessary.Yolanda, how we doin, baby?Just hang in there, baby, you're doing' great, Ringo's proud of you and so am I. It's almost over. Now I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet.It's the one that says Bad Motherfucker on it.That's my bad motherfucker. Now open it up and take out the cash. How much is there?Put it in your pocket, it's yours. Now with the rest of them wallets and the register, that makes this a pretty successful little score.You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing, now hang back and shut the fuck up. Besides, I ain't givin' it to him. I'm buyin' somethin' for my money. Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?Your life. I'm givin' you that money so I don't hafta kill your ass. You read the Bible?There's a passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. \"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.\" I been sayin' that shit for years. And if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. I never really questioned what it meant. I thought it was just a coldblooded thing to say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man. And Mr. .45 here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or is could by you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish. I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to be a shepherd.It's cold.That's probably a good idea.", "clean_line": "okay tell hash bars hash legal right hash bars man fuckin goin examples quarter pounder cheese royale

I mean you can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffin' away. You're only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places.Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it and, if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's legal to carry it, which doesn't really matter 'cause \u0096 get a load of this \u0096 if the cops stop you, it's illegal for this to search you. Searching you is a right that the cops in Amsterdam don't have.You'll dig it the most. But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?It's the little differences. A lotta the same shit we got here, they got there, but there they're a little different.Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer in a movie theatre. And I don't mean in a paper cup either. They give you a glass of beer, like in a bar. In Paris, you can buy beer at MacDonald's. Also, you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?No, they got the metric system there, they wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is.Royale with Cheese.Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger King. But you know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup?Mayonnaise.I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a little bit on the side of the plate, they fuckin' drown 'em in it.How many up there?Counting our guy?So there could be five guys up there?We should have fuckin' shotguns.What's her name?How did Marsellus and her meet?She ever do anything I woulda saw?What's a pilot?I don't watch TV.Yeah.Yeah maybe, fat right?I think I know who you mean, what about him?What'd he do, fuck her?Well what then?A foot massage?That's all?What did Marsellus do?That's a damn shame.Still I hafta say, play with matches, ya get burned.You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage.Antwan probably didn't expect Marsellus to react like he did, but he had to expect a reaction.It's laying hands on Marsellus Wallace's new wife in a familiar way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out \u0096 no, but you're in the same fuckin' ballpark.Not the same thing, the same ballpark.Have you ever given a foot massage?Given a lot of 'em?Have you ever given a guy a foot massage?How many?Would you give me a foot massage \u0096 I'm kinda tired.Seven-twenty-two in the morning.I'm not sayin' he was right, but you're sayin' a foot massage don't mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does. I've given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant somethin'. We act like they don't, but they do. That's what's so fuckin' cool about 'em. This sensual thing's goin' on that nobody's talkin about, but you know it and she knows it, fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan shoulda known fuckin' better. That's his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna have a sense of humor about that shit.What's her name again?Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida and when he's gone, he wants me to take care of Mia.Not that! Take her out. Show her a good time. Don't let her get lonely.It ain't a date. It's like when you and your buddy's wife go to a movie or somethin'. It's just... you know... good company.It's not a date.No.I ain't hungry.Royale with Cheese.Got it.We're happy.Where's the big man?How 'bout a cup of just plain lo' American?At Marsellus' request.Not yet.What's so funny?Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit across a table, chew my food with my mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and that's all I'm gonna do.I ain't your friend, palooka.I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm curious, why would you get a stud in your tongue?Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam.That's a bold statement.Give me three hundred worth of the madman. If it's as good as you say, I'll be back for a thousand.Which one's Trudi? The one with all the shit in her face?I'm on my way somewhere. I got a dinner engagement. Rain check?You don't mind if I shoot up here?Mucho gracias.You know what some fucker did to it the other day?Fuckin' keyed it.Tell me about it. I had the goddamn thing in storage three years. It's out five fuckin' days \u0096 five days, and some dickless piece of shit fucks with it.I just wish I caught 'em doin' it, ya know? Oh man, I'd give anything to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been worth his doin' it, if I coulda just caught 'em, you know what I mean?Hello?Hello.Hello.Okay.What the fuck is this place?Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.After you, kitty-cat.I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.Bloody as hell. And to drink, a vanilla coke.Did you just order a five-dollar shake?A shake? Milk and ice cream?It costs five dollars?You don't put bourbon in it or anything?Just checking.It's like a wax museum with a pulse rate.Rollin' a smoke.It's just tobacco.You can have this one, cowgirl.Think nothing of it.Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.What was it?What?What was your specialty?Do you remember any of the jokes?Tell me.C'mon, don't be that way.You told it in front of fifty million people and you can't tell it to me? I promise I won't laugh.That's not what I meant and you know it.I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.What a gyp.Can I have a sip of that? I'd like to know what a five-dollar shake tastes like.Yeah, but maybe I do.Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin' good milk shake.I don't know if it's worth five dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' good.What?I don't know.I don't think we're there yet. But don't feel bad, we just met each other.I'll do that.We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy Holly doesn't seem to be much of a waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn Monroe's section.No there's not.That's Marilyn Monroe...... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it must be her night off.I have moments.Actually, there's something I've wanted to ask you about, but you seem like a nice person, and I didn't want to offend you.Only if you promise not to get offended.Then let's just forget it.Is that a fact?What do you think about what happened to Antwan?Tony Rocky Horror.That's one way to say it. Another way is, he was thrown out. Another was is, he was thrown out by Marsellus. And even another way is, he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you.No it's not, it's just what I heard.They.They certainly do.No. They just said Rocky Horror gave you a foot massage.No and, that's it.Yeah.At the time I was told, it seemed reasonable.No, it seemed excessive. But that doesn't mean it didn't happen. I heard Marsellus is very protective of you.But did it happen?No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.All right.All right, you asked for it.Was than an uncomfortable silence?I'm gonna take a piss.One drink and leave. Don't be rude, but drink your drink quickly, say goodbye, walk out the door, get in your car, and go down the road....It's a moral test of yourself, whether or not you can maintain loyalty. Because when people are loyal to each other, that's very meaningful.So you're gonna go out there, drink your drink, say \"Goodnight, I've had a very lovely evening,\" go home, and jack off. And that's all you're gonna do.Jesus Christ!Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?I'll be a son-of-a-bitch. Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer me honey, what did you take?Okay honey, we're getting you on your feet.We're on our feet now, and now we're gonna talk out to the car. Here we go, watch us walk.Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way to your place.You still got an adrenaline shot?I need it man, I got a chick she's fuckin' Doing on me.No choice.Yeah. She's dyin'.Negative.Sorry.Too late, I'm already here.If you're through havin' your little hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get your needle and git it now!This fucked up bitch is Marsellus Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin' croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But before he turns me into a bar soap, I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about how you coulda saved her life, but instead you let her die on your front lawn.She's ODing on us.You two are a match made in heaven.What do you need a medical book for?You've had that thing for six years and you never used it?Well then get it.I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.Hurry up man! We're losin' her!I dunno, some medical book.\u0096 get your ass in here, fuck the book!Quit fuckin' around man and give her the shot!Does it have to be exact?Well, I don't know exactly where her heart is, I think it's here.I need a big fat magic marker, got one?I need a big fat magic marker, any felt pen'll do, but a magic marker would be great.You're gonna give her the shot.I've never does this before.Okay, what do I do?I gotta stab her?What happens after that?This ain't a fuckin' joke man!Count to three.Mia!What are your thoughts on how to handle this?Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus can live his whole live and never ever hear of this incident.I seriously doubt that.Let's shake on it.Mum's the word.If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home and have a heart attack.Sure, but I think I'm still a little too petrified to laugh.I can't wait.Mia. How you doin'?Friend of yours?Why the fuck didn't you tell us about that guy in the bathroom? Slip your mind? Forget he was in there with a goddamn hand cannon?Yeah, we were lucky.Yeah, maybe.Yeah, I think so. That means God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.I think we should be going now.Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit happens.Do you wanna continue this theological discussion in the car, or at the jailhouse with the cops?Okay man, it was a miracle, can we leave now?...Ever seen that show \"COPS?\" I was watchin' it once and this cop was on it who was talkin' about this time he got into this gun fight with a guy in a hallway. He unloads on this guy and he doesn't hit anything. And these guys were in a hallway. It's a freak, but it happens.What the fuck does that mean?Jesus Christ!Goddammit, Jules \u0096\u0096 you're fuckin' freakin' out!While you're at it, be sure to tell 'im why.I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he laughs his ass off.Marvin, what do you make of all this?C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets?I just accidentally shot Marvin in the throat.I didn't mean to do it. I said it was an accident.\u0096 chill out, man, it was an accident, okay? You hit a bump or somethin' and the gun went off.Look! I didn't mean to shoot this son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went off, don't ask me how!\u0096 I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin' about the splatter.Can't we just take it to a friendly place?Well, don't look at me, this is your town, Jules.Who ya callin'?Where's Toluca Lake.If he kicks us out, whadda we do?Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin.If the price of that favor is I gotta take shit, he can stick his favor straight up his ass.I was just dryin' my hands.You watched me wash 'em.I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to get off. Maybe if he had some Lava, I coulda done a better job.A \"please\" would be nice.I said a \"please\" would be nice.I don't mean any disrespect. I just don't like people barkin' orders at me.Did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he's wrong, he's immediately forgiven for all wrong-doings?I got a threshold, Jules. I got a threshold for the abuse I'll take. And you're crossin' it. I'm a race car and you got me in the red. Redline 7000, that's where you are. Just know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be drivin' a race car when it's in the red. It could blow.All the way?Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?What?I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went off, I dunno how.Redondo Beach.You know I could go for some breakfast. Want to have breakfast with me?Thanks a bunch. Want a sausage?Are you Jewish?Why not?Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste good.How about dogs? Dogs eat their own feces.Yes, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?So by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he's cease to be a filthy animal?Good for you. Lighten up a little. You been sittin' there all quiet.About what?The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed a freak occurrence.An act of God.I guess it's when God makes the impossible possible. And I'm sorry Jules, but I don't think what happened this morning qualifies.But why?So you're serious, you're really gonna quit?So if you're quitting the life, what'll you do?What do you mean, walk the earth?How long do you intend to walk the earth?What if he never does?So you decided to be a bum?No Jules, you're gonna be like those pieces of shit out there who beg for change. They walk around like a bunch of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in garbage bins, they eat what I throw away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got a word for 'em, they're called bums. And without a job, residence, or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be \u0096 a fuckin' bum!\u0096 what happened was peculiar \u0096 no doubt about it \u0096 but it wasn't water into wine.Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!I gotta take a shit. To be continued.What the fuck's goin' on here?What the hell's goin' on, Jules?Check.Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on general principle.I think we oughta
