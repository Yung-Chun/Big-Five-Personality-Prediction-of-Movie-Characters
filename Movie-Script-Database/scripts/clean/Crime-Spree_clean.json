{"Crime-Spree": {"DANIEL": {"raw_line": "Turn on the flashlight.It has to work. You just bought it this afternoon.You didn't buy batteries?I can't believe you didn't check.Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.Let's go.Be careful it's...... hot!Light your lighter. I can't see anything... and try not to burn down the house!I don't know. He looks dead.Start the car! Start the car!Raymond, get us out of here!You know what makes a good get away driver?Where's your brother?Laurant, how long has he been in there?Uh, yeah.Besides, we don't know the city and--C'mon, Laurant, America?This is Zero.In English. Sami doesn't speak French.Hopefully no one.I just want you there in case there's trouble.We'll see.What?You don't trust me?He said to go fuck yourself.He'll have a sprite. We'll all have sprite.Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.Tonight?Park on the next street over. We'll meet you when we're done.So much for no one being home.Good idea.Marcel, we came here for jewels, remember? Sami moves closer to Zammito, studying his face. He moves over to the dresser where there are several photographs of Zammito with various famous people. Next to the photographs is a plaque that reads: TO FRANCIS ZAMMITO...It's not?You don't carry the same weight in France as you do here.I think he's already figured that out.Cops?If we do this we all have to agree.I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.That moron.Everyone get some sleep. We're leaving in the morning.You slept with her?You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.We can't.You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.You see my friend over there? I nod to him and he's going to put a bullet in your knee.We know all this.So we rob Zammito. You arrest us when we come out and the contents of the safe is now evidence which you can use against him.For what?What kind of business?We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!I'm going to kill him myself!Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.We're moving. Pack up and be on the street in five minutes.I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.Guns. Can you get them?Don't bullshit me.I've got a way with people.I'm from Belgium.Why haven't you turned us in?How much?Fine.Take this. I'll call you in a few hours. You tell me where we meet.Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?You're sure?I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.Do I?You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?All you are is a professional ass-kisser.What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?Has to be.It's me.-- Did you set it up?We had a deal.Fine. Ten o'clock.Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card.Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.We'll think of something.We'll save you the trouble.What's wrong with this guy?We're here to buy, not steal. If you guys are straight there's not going to be a problem.How much for the nines?I'll need extra clips and ammo.There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.I'll tell you when it's time.Julien? Raymond's face fills with sadness. He shakes his.No?We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi.We still have to get out of here.Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.Get that, will you?Because you're the closest.Why is everything an argument with you?Hello?Raymond, grab the tapes. We're leaving!Jesus!Let's go! The Crew moves through the door.The bullet went clean through.When we get back to Paris I'll take you dancing.Bring me the scissors.Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.He's been shot a lot. He's used to it.What'd you get?Cheese? In a can?Thank God.Ready?I'll be back in an hour.Can I trust you, Sami?If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.You haven't answered my question.I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.You better.I would like to see Mr. Bonanno please.Tell him I'm the guy who robbed Frankie Zammito.I guess we're going to find out.Not such a good friend. May I reach in my pocket?I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.Half the tapes.I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.How about if I call you?There's just one more thing I need you to do.Mr. Bonanno, I was wondering if you-- That would be fine. Thank you.Thank you.You have my word. I'll destroy them.It's Daniel.-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.Don't bullshit me, Laurant! I know about the Van Gogh.Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.Go back on deck. There's a small rowboat in the water --Put the money in the rowboat and untie it. The current will carry it down river. When we see that the money is there I'll call back and tell you where the tapes are.Go down into the main cabin. The tapes are in the wooden chest.This is for Julien.I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.You didn't check it?", "clean_line": "turn flashlight work bought afternoon buy batteries believe check list like saying buy car tires let careful hot light lighter try burn house know looks dead start car start car raymond know makes good away driver brother laurant long uh yeah know city mon laurant america zero english sami speak french hopefully want case trouble ll trust said fuck ll sprite ll sprite good zero julien window disable motion detector rest come door good idea gets license number leads raymond ll steal tonight park street ll meet home good idea marcel came jewels remember sami moves closer zammito studying face moves dresser photographs zammito famous people photographs plaque reads francis zammito carry weight france think figured cops agree pretty fuckin bad gave wrong address sophie moron sleep leaving morning slept think little suspicious knew hours wanted sleep know nose bastaldi ass seconds going steal money man gets time tapes going stop looking think women hard think friend nod going bullet knee know rob zammito arrest come contents safe evidence use kind business leaving raymond bag bastaldi dead fuckin dead going kill forget money ve got bigger problems money right moving pack street minutes ll right gets car walks guns bullshit ve got way people belgium haven turned fine ll hours tell meet know bastaldi deal zammito sure think cut dick bastaldi told bastaldi lap dog better professional ass kisser threat fuckin threatening marcel set deal fine clock sami tomorrow lift wallet looks like need rent car need credit card risky need pulled stolen car ll think ll save trouble wrong guy buy steal guys straight going problem nines ll need extra clips ammo grand going thing need ll tell time julien raymond face fills sadness shakes chance walk zammito house want live long paris long kill bastaldi okay airports train stations bus station know connected car rental agencies picked raymond closest argument hello raymond grab tapes leaving jesus let crew moves door bullet went clean paris ll dancing bring scissors cut pants leg groin shot lot cheese thank god ready ll hour trust sami taken surprise gotten tapes left haven answered question leaving friends trusting right thing today better like mr bonanno tell guy robbed frankie zammito guess going good friend reach pocket ve got tell mr bonanno guy idiot lived long mystery recorded conversation years ve got lot people looking like home half tapes ll destroy paris want people home know honor word thing need mr bonanno wondering fine thank thank word ll destroy daniel ve got tapes want brother jail exactly bring million euros boat clock bullshit laurant know van gogh better money clock come ll destroy tapes deck small rowboat water money rowboat untie current carry river money ll tell tapes main cabin tapes wooden chest julien promised bonanno destroy tapes check"}, "SAMI": {"raw_line": "Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.You're probably here for the money I owe you. I don't have it. Marcel opens the door to the bathroom and pushes Sami inside.You know this is how rumors get started.Told you.Yeah, I can see that.Me?I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.But I'd be... I'd be happy to go.I'm Sami. Marcel sent me.You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel. You guys don't want me, I'll be more than happy to leave.Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.Algeria.Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --He speaks about himself in the third person?Let me handle this.Hey, brother. What's happening, man?You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?Ouh La La.Thanks.They don't serve wine here.This kind.After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.When do we go?You ever hear of jet lag?I can't even hear myself think.No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?Something like that.Something like that.You ask a lot of questions.I don't remember. I was drunk.No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?It's okay. It was a long time ago.Who's gonna see it there?I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.Oh, you think?We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.I'll be Elvis and you--It's my idea.Okay. You can be Elvis.And the rest of us are... John, Paul, George and Ringo.We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe -- Do you know who that is?No, that's not Mr. Taylor.That's Frankie Zammito. The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.Yeah. Right. You're not a vendetta kind of guy.C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.How'd it go? I don't know. Daniel, how would you say it went?No.It's not your fault.I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.It's three in the morning. Not much else to do.Where is she?Bag? Sami runs to the table. The black canvas bag is gone. CLOSE ON DANIEL: Asleep. Sami shakes him. He opens his eyes.Get up. We've been ripped off!Not everything.I was going to listen to it last night but I ---- feel asleep.Well, actually I would say she slept with me.What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.No. Chicks dig me.Holy shit.No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.Yeah, but you did do it. So let's deal with that.They'll be waiting for us at the airport.We have to find Sophie.Wait here.Hi. Did a woman just check in? She's about five six. Pretty. Dark hair.C'mon man, I think she's having an affair.I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.Where is it, Sophie?Who are you waiting for?We've been set up.We didn't go to the wrong house. We went to right one, didn't we Sophie?They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why? Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.You wanna tell him?He's got a point.What are you getting out of this?Why?So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.-- We don't have time to look for it. Hadley's first move is going to be to look for us there.\"Vase with twelve Sunflowers.\"It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?You guys used to work together?All right, knock it off.I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.What?Hadley --Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.We've got to get out of here.You're not helping.It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.I don't know.Do you know who this is?If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.You set me up, you piece of shit!What are you doing?Wired? I ain't wired.You killed her!Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.They don't have a murder weapon?You want the tapes for yourself. You're going to sell them.You didn't have to kill Sophie.What about me? Aren't I a loose end?And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't pretend to be something different than what I am.It's not your fault, Daniel.I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.He's right. The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi.Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.I'm going to get some cigarettes.Go away.Room 912.Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.What's he joking around for? He's been shot.Anybody hungry?Some bread and...Cheese.It's good.Hey, you know you can't this in France.I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.Glenmorangie.But I'll have a glass of Beaujolais with you when we get back.What?Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.Does it really matter what I say?I will.Same place. One hour.What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?The lamp?See, I told you that you could trust me.Since we're such good pals I thought I'd sneak you an advanced copy of my latest work. I call it, \"I am a scum-sucking FBI agent\".You want the tapes for yourself. You're going to sell them.You didn't have to kill Sophie.It's a little arty I know, but it has great content, don't you think? You were so busy looking for a wire you probably didn't even think about a video camera. It was on the statue. Anyway, I've sent a copy of the whole tape to the Chicago P.D. and the FBI. They'll get it tomorrow. If I were you I'd take the day off.Did you have to use that much explosive?This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.No! You can't have the baseball!
