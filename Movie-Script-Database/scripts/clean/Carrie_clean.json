I said... `shucks.'Hey.Hey, what's the matter?What did I do?Hey, everything's all right. I love you, honey. Did I...?Who?Praying Carrie?It's... beautiful. That's what she said when I read that poem you wrote for me.And Big Belly Fromm saying... That isn't exactly criticism, Miss White. Jesus!Hey, honey, it was a beautiful poem. I wish I could have written it. Honey?Don't call her that. Don't call me that. What the hell's the matter with you?Hey, are you crying? Are you?Jesus, Sue, what is it?Told me what?That thing in the shower? Hey, it was a joke, wasn't it? I mean, everyone was doing it.You're special.So you were teasing Carrie White \u00adShe's used to it. Jesus, you remember how she'd get down on her knees and say grace in the cafeteria... alone, for Christ's sake. And the way she dresses... Hey, Sue, she's asking for it.How would I like to be Carrie White?What's the big deal about being popular? I mean, one day I'll wake up and find myself working at my dad's car lot and out Friday nights and Saturdays at Uncle Billy's or the Cavalier drinking beer and maybe married with a bunch of kids... What's that got to do with Carrie White? Or anything?I can understand that. Hey, back in seventh grade, there was this kid...Like what?Okay, you tell her you're sorry.What are you going to do? Kiss her, for God's sake?What the hell do you want me to do?Don't say that!Cut it out!Okay, what can I do?You want me to sit here and think about... Jesus! Are you serious? You're serious. What's there to think about?Jesus.I never thought about her. I mean, she wasn't someone you had to think about. She was always there \u00ad keeping to herself in that stupid dress \u00ad that weird mother. You know what I mean?Carrie White?Hi!Sure, what's up?Uh-huh.Sure. What?Are you out of your mind?Okay. I'll do it.How're you doing?I thought you had gym this period.What're you reading?Umm... if you don't have a date for the Prom, would you want to go with me?The Prom......It's next Friday, and I know this is later notice, but they stop selling tickets soon, and \u00adCarrie...Hey, Carrie! Wait!Hey, it's no big deal.Sorry.Miss Collins, I have to get to practice.Look, this is between Sue and me. If you don't mind...What's the big deal?Anyway, she's already said no.Don't overrate me.Okay.Well...So this is where you live.Aren't you going to ask me in?Why not?Right to the point, huh? Okay, about the prom.Nothing to stop you changing your mind. Girls do it all the time.Hey, I'm asking you because I want to.Look, I don't do anything I don't want to.Sure you can.Don't you think you better answer?You're going with me.You're going.No one will laugh. We'll see to it.Not `til you say yes.I don't know. Maybe it's because you liked my poem.I'll pick you up at eight.Hi.You can still change your mind, you know.C'mon.Scared?Hey, it won't be so bad.Really, I mean it. They're okay, you'll see. Don't be nervous. Besides... I'd look awfully silly dancing by myself.When did you come out of the treetops, Bomba?Cold sweat is running down my thighs in rivers.He's a good guy. See, didn't I tell you? Sure you don't want to dance?`scuse me. Be right back, okay?What are you doing with my date?Don't let me catch you hugging any guys.Better not. Hey, listen, do you really have to be back so early?Okay. I understand.No, it's okay. Listen, the other kids are going over to Lewiston after the Prom \u00adWhat is?Hey, let me finish. What I was going to say, I mean if it'd be alright with you, what do you say we go to the Cavalier?Hey, great. We'll have the place all to ourselves. Great! Then it's settled.C'mon...You can.Hey...I...No harm, no foul.You danced.It's easy.Why what?It's the prom.Because I asked you. And...Because I wanted to.Because......you liked my poem. Only I didn't write it. Someone else did.Look, Carrie, we're here, we're together... and I like it, you know... I mean, I...Hey, look!C'mon.I know. Want to decline?Hell, no. If you win, all you do is sit up there for the school song and one dance. And they put your picture in the yearbook so everyone can see we looked like idiots. Besides, it's the last year.You're beautiful.Whatever you like.Let's vote for ourselves. To the devil with false modesty.Hurt yourself?There's still your boat.
