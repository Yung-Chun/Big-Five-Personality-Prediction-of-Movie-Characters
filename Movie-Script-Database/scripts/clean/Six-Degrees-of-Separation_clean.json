{"Six-Degrees-of-Separation": {"OUISA": {"raw_line": "Is anything gone? OUISA opens the front closet with trepidation. But nothing leaps out. SHE sees a mink is still there..My god! The Kandinsky! 0UISA runs into the living room. SHE can see by the discoloration on that wall that a painting is missing.We could've been killed.How can you think of things? We could have been murdered.Slashed ---our throats slashed. Go to bed at night happy and then murdered. Would we have-woken up? OUISA screams.I am in no mood to go to any wedding.They're your friendsYou don't call out Hello unless-- THEY walk softly to the dark hall.We didn't all night. THEY look down the silent dark hall.Then I'll drive.Let's just get thereBe care - ! A CAR veers by. FLAN swerves his car.Let me drive!When you're in one of these moods you do not drive well and I do not want to be killed today.Stop saying that!I went in the room first. FLAN looks for signs.You didn't see what I saw! FLAN puts on brakes.It's not Maria Callas. It's that truck and you.Happy is the bride the sun shines onNo no! Could've been killed. All fine!Do not make a scene. THEY kneel.I pray the Lord my soul to keep-If I should die - I pray the Lord my soul to take - COUPLE IN THE PEW IN FRONT turn. A MAN, A WOMAN, strangely not unlike FLAN and OUISA, perhaps A few years older, perhaps more nautical as if they'd flown a in from Nantucket, are named SANDY and CONNIE.We were almost murderedControl. Chaos. Control.I do not always get this way at weddings.Oh, it was awful awful awful awful. Then OUISA and FLAN put on their best smiles as THEY pass through a receiving line, finally shaking hands with theYes! Only hours ago!Wouldn't miss it! THE BRIDE and GROOM look after THEM.Tell them! SANDY and CONNIE and JULIA sit down at the small table.A friend we hadn't seen for many years came by for dinner. I don't think you know him -Don't say it so portentously.Don't be ga-ga. Something large.We knew GeoffreyThey've moved back to South Africa.He's King Midas rich. Literally. Gold mines. THE WAITER puts down the tray of drinks.But he is always short of cash because his government won't let its people ---- its white people take out any money. So it's like taking in a War Baby.I hate when he uses the word \"superfluous\". I mean, we needed two million and we hadn't seen Geoffrey in a long time and while Geoffrey might not have the price of a dinner he easily might have two million dollars.Face it. The money does get in the -Having a rich friend is like drowning and your friend makes life boats. But the friend gets very touchy if you say one word: life boat. Well, that's two words. We were afraid our South African friend might say \"You only love me for my. life boats?\" But we like Geoffrey.Should we?Portentous.With the kids away, we get used to a lower noise quotient. FLAN pours a drink for GEOFFREY.Putting your life on the line.But we'd visit you and sit in your gorgeous house planning trips into the townships demanding to see the poorest of the poor. \"Are you sure they're the worst off? I mean, we've come all this way. We don't want to see people just mildly victimized by apartheid. We demand shock.\" It doesn't seem right sitting on the East Side talking about revolution.No. La Passionaria. I will come to South Africa and build barricades and lean against them, singing.\"Follow Follow Follow\". What's that song?China. FLAN and OUISA Oh.A role in history. To say that so easily. GEOFFREY suddenly gets up and looks through the telescope by the window.The phrase - striking coal miners - I see all these very striking coal miners modelling the fall fashions.The sign painter screwed up the sign. Instead of The Hunan Wok, he painted The Human Wok.I don't think genius has kissed the Human Wok. THEY finish off their drinks.This restaurant - they wrap ravioli up like salt water taffy. FLAN appears behind HER to help HER. THEY both wrestle the coats out of the closet.Did you hear - to take back to Johannesburg. out in Eastharptona guy goes into one of the better food stores -one of the Dean and DeLuca look alikes. Gets a pack of cigarettes and an ice cream bar. Goes up front. Sees there's a line at the register. Slaps down two twenty dollar bills and goes out. GEOFFREY doesn't get the anecdote.They have the joke page of things around New York.We weren't auditioning but I kept thinking Two Million dollars Two Million dollars.Two million dollars Two million dollars.What ever you do, don't think about elephants.And he mentioned our childrens' names.Harvard. You can say Harvard.Are you okay?His shirt is not bleeding. He's bleeding. PAUL holds his mouth, nauseous.Thank you, Eddie - EDDIE goes. FLAN, followed by OUISA, supports PAUL intoWe bathed him. We did First Aid.The Red Cross advises: Press edges of the wound firmly together, wash area with water-You darling old poop -An absolute revelation - this'll only take a mo- OUISA rushes out of the bathroom after GEOFFREY.I ran down the hall to get the book on Cezanne, got the gauze from my bathroom--Gave the Cezanne to Flan who wanted the gauze, gave the gauze to Geoffrey who wanted Cezanne. OUISA mutters under her breath as she dashes downtwo million dollars two million dollarsTwo million dollars two million dollars--Please? Stay? GEOFFREY pauses.And peace was restored.Can you believe what the kids said? PAUL looks at the framed photos on wall ofYou like? You like? Chaos? Control? Chaos? Control? SHE puts on a goofy happy face for the chaotic side and a dopey tragic face for the geometric. Yes. We've been here before, through OUISA's memory, at the wedding.Geoffrey had been silent up to now.Tell us about our children.How Harvard?We asked him where home wasHe's in the movies?Someone is directing a film of Cats?A benefit for some disease or school---Of course they can.Cats?What a courageous stand!Eureka in the bathtub. How wonderful.And it was here we pulled up - ever so slightly - pulled up closer--He named the greatest black star in movies.Sidney Poitiers There. I don't care. We have to have truth. He started out as a lawyer and is terrified of libel. I'm not.We're-going out to dinner. You'll come.Because we have reservations and oh my god'what time is it? Have we lost the reservations and we don't have a damn thing in the house and it's Sixteenth century Florence and there's genius on every block.He mentioned our kids names--They've never mentioned you.Even Geoffrey was touched.Oh no! Tell us stories of movie stars tying up their children and being cruel.He's married to an actress who was in one of-- she's white? Am I right?Oh, I'm sorry. We didn't mean to -It's Geoffrey's only night in New York.We moved.into the kitchen.We watched him cook and chop.An old jar of sun dried tomatoes--There is a boarding school in Switzerland that takes you at age eighteen months.Does Freud say that? PAUL holds out three dishes heaped with food.Shall we move into the dining room? OUISA opens double doors leading intoDon't look at the sewing machine. FLAN sweeps the bill things off the table onto a chair. OUISA opens the sideboard and takes out four linen place mats and silverware and quickly sets the table. PAUL takes out matches and lights the Haitian card\"e'Yabra. FLAN runs into the living room and returns with a vase of flowers. THEY smile at the appearance of the sudden party in this wonderful room. THEY sit down. THEY eat. Surprise. It's delicious.The best!Where's yours?Have you declared your major yet?The Holocaust and Ethics?I think we're lucky having this dinner. Isn't this the finest time? A toast to you.Let's not be star fuckers.I just loved the kid so much. I wanted to reach out to him.Well, indeed.Cover to coverNot some flea bag.You'll stay here tonight.We'll get you up.Your feet might hang out over the endPushy. Both of you. PAUL sits on the bed, testing it.Whatever you do, don't think about elephants. GEOFFREY puts on his overcoat.Love to Diana. OUISA kisses GEOFFREY on the cheek.We embraced. And Flan and Geoffrey left -Hal Leave it for - PAUL looks at the table filled with dishes and bowls and glasses and napkins.Yvonne will be in on Tuesday.Let me -He's in? FLAN parades around the table.Two million!Happy days! Oh god! PAUL comes into the dining room.Break all those dishes! Two million! Go to ten! And we put up nothing?A modern.. Impressionist. Renaissance.Japanese. OUISA, FLAN and PAUL go down the hall toWife doesn't want hubby to know she owns a Cezanne. PAUL looks at the slide.Tonight was a very nervous very casual very big thing.All the better. 0 FLAN opens a door in the OFFICE. THE OFFICE connects toYou were wonderful!Keep it. Look at the time.Give him fifty dollars.Suppose your father's plane is late?Walking around money. I wouldn't want my kids to be stuck in the street without a nickel. PAUL sits on the bed and takes off his shoes.And we picked up two million dollars. One billionth of a percent commission is -We'd love to. Bring him up for dinner.Sure. If Paul does the cooking. FLAN, OUISA and PAUL laugh. OUISA goes into the bathroom and fills a glass with water and puts it on the night table.Goodnight. PAUL smiles at them.Who said when artists dream they dream of money? I must be such an artist. Bravo. Bravo. FLAN putting on pajamas, OUISA her nightgown.It won't. We're safe. OUISA in bed turns off the light. FLAN looks out the window onto the park.Why don't you tell me how much these things mean? You wait till the last minute - OUISA and FLAN get into bed.Not worry me? I'm your partner.And his name- is --Sidney. THEY embrace. THE CAMERA comes in very close, circling FLAN and OUISA, their love, their safety. Then THE CAMERA drifts back and away from them, travelling out through the window, out of their cocoon toI dreamt of Sidney Poitier and his rise to acclaim. I dreamt that Sidney Poitier sat at the edge of my bed and I asked him what troubled him? Sidney? What troubles you? Is it right to make a movie of Cats?And you can get all that into Cats? THE CAMERA drifts round with OUISA'S gaze to finally see \"SIDNEY'S\" face. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd,. It is PAUL.Thank you. Thank you. You shall. THE CAMERA circles off PAUL to OUISA. She is asleep. CUT BACK to reveal No one is sitting on the bed. THE CAMERA moves onto FLAN's face, sleeping. Slides of paintings by Matisse, Picasso, De Kooning, Pollock appear over his face.I sat in the kitchen happily doing the cross word puzzle in ink. Everybody does it in ink. I never. met one person who didn't say they did it in ink.And I'm doing the puzzle and I see the time and it's nearly seven and Paul had to meet his father and I didn't want him to be late and was he healthy after his stabbing? OUISA puts the puzzle down and goes intoThe hall is eighteen feet long. OUISA walks down the hall which now seems impossibly long.I stopped in front of the door. OUISA taps on the door of her daughter's room.Paul? SHE hears - what? - sounds of moaning?Paul??Are you all right? OUISA opens the door toFlan!!Stop it! He might have a gun!He has a gun! He has a knife! THE HUSTLER chases OUISA around the room. FLAN chases the HUSTLER. THE DOG chases FLAN. PAUL,dressed, runs in to the living room, carrying THE HUSTLER's clothes which HE hurls down onto the sofa.You went out after we went to sleep and picked up this thing?Just go.Get out!And that's that.You have to do something.Is anything gone?Did he take anything?I want to know if anything's gone?We could have been killed.How can you think of things? We could have been murdered. FLAN picks up an ornate Victorian inkwell capped by a silver beaver.Slashed ---our throats slashed. A framed portrait of a pug.Go to bed at night happy and then murdered. would we have woken up?Don't pick it up! FLAN does.We're safe? As FLAN hangs up the phone we hear a car door shut as FLAN and OUISA get in their car.That's all we know! And FLAN and OUISA drive out of the parking lot.Do we have a story to tell you!Our two and their son are at Harvard together. KITTY and LARKIN are pleased about this.You tell your story first.You had another house guest. KITTY and LARKIN laugh.Was anything missing from your house?Have you talked to your kids?Sherry Netherlands. I'd like--No! I'm not a fan. This is not a fan call. Sidney Poitier must be registered. His son is a friend of- CLICK. The Sherry's hung up. The doorbell rings. FLAN goes to the door.Hi. Celebrity Service? I'm not sure how you work.You track down celebrities? Am I right?I'm trying to find out how one would get in touch with---No, I'm not a press agent--No, I'm not with anyone---My husband. Flanders Kittredge?He came into our house.He told us the story of Catcher In The Rye.We don't know.He picked up a hustler.He didn't steal anything.Granted this does not seem major now.Our kids came down from Harvard. a Loud groans of protest and disbelief fill theAnd none of you knows this fellow? He has this wild quality--yet, a real elegance and a real concern and a real consideration. TESS looks at the floral arrangement PAUL sent. It's only slightly wilted.I wish I knew how to get hold of his father. Just to see if there is any truth in it.We went down to the Strand -I found it! OUISA'S HAND reaches up and brings down.\"Back in New York with Juanita and the children, I began to become aware that our marriage, while working on some levels, was falling apart in other fundamental areas.\" FLAN takes the book.No sons!This kid bulldozing his way into our lives.It seems the common thread linking us all is an overwhelming need to be in the movie of Cats.I vote yes.We had to enlist our children -He knows the details about our lives.You are not climbing mountains.All right. Track down everybody in your high school class. Male. Female. Whatever. Not just homosexuals. Drug addicts. The kid might be a drug dealer. DOUG throws back his chair.It wasn't just that. It was fun.Film is a different medium.I don't remember saying that.This is not racist! THE KIDS stride out of the DINING HALL intoHere is a copy of your yearbook. I want you to get the phone numbers of everybody in your class. You all went to the same boarding school.Call everyone in your class and ask them if they know-- THE THREE KIDS try to break through the blockade.How long did Trent keep Paul? TESS shushes OUISA.Paul learned all that in three months!who would have thought it? Trent Conway, the Henry Higgins of our time. THE GROUP laughs and finishes their drinks as THE USHER unlocks the door toPaul must have looked at all those names and said I am Columbus. I am Magellan. I will sail into this new world. The camera comes in on OUISA as she remembersI read somewhere that everybody on this planet is separated by only six other people. Six degrees of separation. Between us and everybody else on this planet. The President of the United States. A. gondolier in Venice. Fill in the names. I find that A.] tremendously comforting that we're so close and B.] like Chinese water torture that we're so close. Because you have to find the right six people to make the connection. It's not just big names. It's anyone. A native in a rain forest. A Tierra del Fuegan. An Eskimo. I am bound to everyone on this planet by a trail of six people. It's a profound thought. How Paul found us. How to find the man whose son he pretends to be. Or perhaps j& his son, although I doubt it. How every person is a new door, opening up into other worlds. Six degrees of separation between me and everyone else on this planet. But to find the right six people. TESS kisses HER MOTHER. OUISA puts out the light and THEY leave the room.He just vanished.Yes! We are going to Rome. CONNIE gives OUISA a card with a name on it. OUISA reads the card and passes it to FLAN.No! I don't know them. FLAN smiles when HE sees the card.To stand at the very top on scaffolding!We were at the opera and ran into them and they gave us your address!scraped all this paint off itFlan went for business but for me it was - THE OWNERS of this loft are a MAN, 40s, who is confined to a wheel chair, and his beautiful COMPANION, an elegant Japanese woman. THE TEN DINNER GUESTS are dressed all in black, except OUISA who has on a bright Chanel suit. SHE and FLAN have managed to capture stage center.Well, the day we got back from Rome -our doorman whom we tip very well at Christmas and any time he does something nice for us-- our doorman spits at my husband, J. Flanders Kittredge. I mean, spit at him! The DOORMAN - FRANK - good faithful loyal FRANK - holds the door open and spits at FLAN.The cops called us up and we went down to the precinct again!The next chapter. THE PARTY is silenced.And he did!She was one of those armies of young people who come to New York filled with dreams and end up on a treadmill working and working just to stay alive.Yes. Yes, I can.It wasn't so embarrassing.talk about six degreesYes! There we were roller skating for heart disease or cancer -I hadn't skated in I hate to tell you how manyThe body must have just landed there in a clumpThe blood just oozing out slowly towards the curb. FLAN and OUISA and another COUPLE, SANDY and CONNIE from the wedding, stop at the sight. They stare at the body that has slammed into the pavement. The body of RICK.We just missed it by minutes.Perhaps we could have saved him - called an ambulance - but it was too late -Was it that cold?We haven't seen him since that night.How do we find him?Six degrees. Six degrees. OUISA looks at FLAN. FLAN is so secure.You could wall paper the Empire State Building with all the copies he made.We'd love to but can't!Black-tie auction - Sotheby's - FLAN leans in close to KITTY. Top secret.but a Matisse -Not allowed to tell. OUISA turns to look up at the choir loft.Don't tell all the family secrets -Not that much in this new market.I'm totally dolled up. The black. Have you seen it? I have to tell you the sign I saw today. Cruelty-free cosmetics. A store was selling cruelty-free cosmetics.Dearest, I know that. I'm only talking about the phrase. Cruelty-free cosmetics should take away all evidence of time and cellulite and--I thought you were going to Afghanistan.One country at a time. You are not getting married.I know everyone you know and you are not marrying any of them.Unless you met them in the last two days - you can't hold a secret. Wait- I'm putting you on holdWait. Hold on.Hello?Paul? We will cut back and forth between these two locations for the remainder of this scene. At times, the two will share the screen. During this scene OUISA walks throughout THE APARTMENT speaking on the cordless phone.Let me put you on hold. I'm talking to my child.You have to turn yourself in. The boy comaitted suicide. You stole the money. The girl is pressing charges. They're going to get you. Why not turn yourself in and you can get of f easier. You can strike a bargain. Learn when you're trapped. You're so brilliant. You have such promise. You need help.What would you want me to do?That's impossible-.My husband feels you betrayed him.You were lunatic! And picking that drek off the street. Are you suicidal? Do you have AIDS? Are you infected?Where have you been?You're not in trouble? I mean, more trouble?Nobody has that.What do you think we are?What have the kids told him about us?Then perhaps I'd better hang up.As well you should.No. I read them too.Oh yes. Even gone to the top of it in a rickety elevator to watch the men clean it.Absolutely. Stood right under the hand of God touching the hand of man.I slapped God's clean hand. And you know what they clean it with? All this technology? Q-tips and water. PAUL is thrilled by this bit of knowledge.Clean away the years of grime and soot and paint ovens. Q-tips and water changing the history of Western art. Vivid colors.Take you to see it? Paul, they think you might have murdered someone! You stole money! 0 FLAN appears, needing help with his studs.Look, why don't you cone here. Where are you? PAUL, pressed in the battered phone booth, doesn't want to be in this cold street with its brightly lit squalor. HE wants to be at OUISA's, but his fear wins out.You have to trust us.Because - we like you.We're going out now. But you could be here when we come back.To Sotheby's. FLAN grabs the phone.You can't.You are! Who are you? What's your real name?Why?It was magical. That Salinger stuff - SHE turns on the chandelier in the DINING ROOM.Your cooking -Everything is somebody else's-Yes. You got me there. That is mine. It is no one else's.There's so much you don't know. You are so. smart and so stupid -Have some flexibility! You're stupid not to recognize what you could be.So much.Perhaps. You liked that night? I've thought since that you spent all your time laughing at us.Please?Paul? You need help. Go to the police. Turn yourself in. You'll be over it all the sooner. You can start.Your life.I will help you. But you have to go to the police and go to jail and -Yes. OUISA walks rapidly down the HALL.I will visit you.I'll knock em dead. But you've got to be careful in prison. You have to use condoms.Go to the police.I'll give you the name of-the detective to see-I don't think they kill you. PAUL puts the phone receiver over his head in a sudden gesture of fear. Then HE returns the receiver to his ear.I will deliver you to them with kindness and affection.A few months tops.We'll work that out.Yes. You'll work for us.Top to bottom.No.You should have your own place.We'll help you find a place.We'll help you out. PAUL beams as HE becomes the PAUL from that night. His imagination is off and running. The lights, from wherever HE is, shine on his face and reflect on the broken glass of the booth.Believe it or not, we have two Philadelphia Chippendale chairs -Quality. Always. You'll have all that. Philadelphia Chippendale.Make it all history. Put it behind you.It can't be tonight. I will take you tomorrow. We have an auction tonight at Sotheby's -I can't. It's black tie.Yes.Eight o'clock.We're going to drinks before at the Pierre.Germans.Which father?Paul. He's not your father. And Flanders. is not your father. FLAN comes in to the living room, dressed.We'll be there in half an hour.We'll be there. Paul. We love you.We'll have a wonderful life. SHE hangs up and looks at FLAN.We can skip the shmoozing. Pick the boy up, take him to the police and be at Sotheby's before eight.t The story ended there...There are so many other people here tonight. We didn't mean to take up so much MRS. BANNISTER slams her napkin down.We told them Paul was at the Waverly theater. FLAN Sixth Avenue and Third Street. The lobby.But we had promised Paul that we would bring him to the police. We told the police he was special.The detective said he'd honor our promise.But we didn't count onTraffic traffic traffic FLAN gets out of the car and looks ahead in this din of honking horns.Paul? Officer? Let me go with you - I promised I'd take him!We have to do soaething!went to the precinct.Since yesterday? He's been handling thisThis is about an arrest made yesterday at the Waverly Movie theater - THE CLERK checks the records.I didn't imagine it -Could you find out which precinct - THE CLERK looks through the book.Poitier. He's a young black man. Or maybe Kittredge. I don't know the exact name -Not exactly. But the detective promised me yesterday that I could go with the young man when he was arraigned to let them know he was special.Like what?We can find anybody - Six degrees THE CLERK closes the book.We weren't family. We didn't know Paul's name.I went to the District Attorney's office. we weren't family. We didn't know Paul's name.I called the Criminal Courts. I wasn't family. I didn't know Paul's name.You see, I read today that a young man committed suicide in Riker's Island. Tied a shirt around his neck and hanged himself. Was it the pink shirt? This burst of color? The pink shirt. Was it Paul? We never found out who he was.He wanted to be us. Everything we are in the world, this paltry thing--our life--he wanted it. He stabbed himself to get into our lives. He envied us. We're not enough to be envied.Having a heart is not the point. We were hardly taken in. We believed him -- for a few hours. He did more for us in a few hours than our children ever did. He wanted to be your child. Don't let that go. He sat out in that park and said that man is my father. He's in trouble and we don't know how to help him.You were attracted to him -Attracted by youth and his talent and the embarrassing prospect of being in the movie version of Cats. Did you put that in your Times piece? And we turn him into anecdote to dine out on. Like this. As we are right now. But it was an experience. I will not turn him into an anecdote. How do we fit what happened to us into life without turning it into an anecdote with no teeth and a punch line we'll mouth over and over for years to come. \"Tell the story about the imposter who came into our lives---\" \"That reminds me of the time this boy--\". And we become these human juke boxes spilling out these anecdotes. But it was an experience. How do we keep the experience? OUISA looks around the dinner table. THE GUESTS have decided to start on their dinners.Then I am a collage of unaccounted-for brush strokes. I an all random. OUISA stands up from the dinner table. Her chair scrapes. There is an embarrassed rush. MRS. BANNISTER Sit down. OUISA leaves the dinner table.God, Flan, how much of your life can you account for?

An early abstract painting by Kandinsky leans against a Philadelphia Chippendale chair: the painting is wild and brilliantly colored.Don't say that. The silver Victorian inkwell! FLAN runs past OUISA down the hall back to the living room. OUISA follows HIM back intoI want to know if anything's gone? HE picks up an ornate Victorian inkwell capped by a silver beaver and looks at it with great objectivity..There's the inkwell. Silver beaver. Why? OUISA, drained, looks out the window down onto Central Park.We have to go to the wedding.We have toI beg to differ. They're Your fr - FLAN stops, frightened suddenly, listening.Hello? OUISA runs to HIM, terrified. HE holds HER.I think we could tell if someone else was here.I have to hang on.Driving calms me!We could have been killed last night.I'm driving slowly. See. Slowly.Where's the goddam turnoff onto the Taconic? A truck veers and almost hits them.It's that fucking Maria Callas! Turn that damn thing off!And last night. THE COUNTRYSIDE speeds by.Wonderful wedding. Wonderful day. THEY run intoEither side. I can't even remember how we met them. Why are we here? THEY walk down the aisle, heads down.Now I lay me down to sleep - the most terrifying words just think of it -The nightmare part - If I should die before I wake -We always get this way at weddings. THE BRIDE and GROOM resume their run up the aisle. It's FLAN and OUISA's turn to leave the pew and go up the aisle. SHE is stricken.We're alive. THEY walk up the aisle into the foyer of the chapel. SHE puts her head into his shoulder.But we're here!No no. You're not pryingDo we know each other?We were having a wonderful evening last night.Geoffrey Miller. From South Africa--Geoffrey from South Africa.through our children when Geoffrey and his family all lived in New York.He was here in New York briefly on business and asked us to ask him for dinner.Seventy thousand workers in just one gold mine.Its white people --When he called it was like a bolt from the blue as I had a deal coming up and was short byThe figure is superfluous OUISA turns to CONNIE.The currents last night were very churny.It's that awful thing of having truly rich folk for friends.Only if you let it. The fact of the money shouldn't get in-It wasn't a life-threatening evening.Hardly a Life Boat evening - OUISA sits, enjoying this.But when Geoffrey called and asked us to take him for dinner, he made a sudden pattern in life's little tea leaves because who wants to go to banks? FLAN'S VOICE takes us back to last nightGeoffrey called and our tempests settled into showers and life was manageable. What more can you want?What's wrong?Geoffrey, you have to move out of South Africa. You'll be killed. Why do you stay in South Africa?Planning the revolution that will destroy you.Only small murky cafes for Pepe le Noko here.And the people would follow.The way Gorbachev cheered on the striking coal miners in the Ukraine - yes, you must strike- it is your role in history to dismantle this system. Russia and Poland - you can't believe the developments in the world - \"The Fantasticks\" \"Follow Follow Follow\".That is your role in history. Not our role. OUISA ponders this thought.There's good Szechuan. And Hunan.We made reservations. FLAN looks at the slide projector.Geoffrey, I'd like to show - FLAN'S sentence hangs in mid-air as GEOFFREY follows OUISASix on a plate for a few hundred dollars. And FLAN gets the coats. A clatter of tennis rackets falling. GEOFFREY takes his topcoat.Dean and DeLuca - FLAN helps OUISA on with her coat.We sent it to the Times. GEOFFREY smiles politely. FLAN and OUISA press a little bit too hard.They send you a bottle of champagne. THEY all laugh brightly.It's like when people say -Don't think about elephants' and all you can think about is elephants elephants elephants.Louisa is a dada manifesto. About the Cezanne - unless we're careful, it'll be sold and never seen again - FLAN switches off the room's lights and clicks on the projector. The slide projection of a beautiful green landscape by Cezanne fills the wall by the door.Mid-period. Landscape of a dark green forest. In the far distance you see the sunlight. One of his first uses of a pale color being forced to carry the weight of the picture. The experiment that would pay of f in the apples. A burst of color asked to carry so much-- The Japanese don't like anything about it except it's a Cezanne-- And suddenly the door in the wall opens up. A YOUNG BLACK MAN supported by the ELEVATOR MAN, appears in the Cezanne forest holding his eyes against the projector's light. And OUISA behind HIM. FLAN clicks off the projector. OUISA switches on the living room lights. THE YOUNG BLACK MAN - PAUL - is in his early twenties, very handsome, very preppy. His shirt front is ripped and bloodied. Fresh blood. EDDIE helps PAUL to the sofa, OUISA following at a loss.And the school where they went.We don't want to get into libel.His shirt's bleeding.Where's the first aid book! OUISA runs into their bedroom. PAUL looks out the bathroom door into FLAN and OUISA'S bedroom. PAUL watches OUISA as she goes intoYes! I'm doing that - Hold on FLAN daubs on mercurochrome.Hold still! Ouisa! I need gauze! GEOFFREY pokes his head in the bathroom.Have you seen the new book on Cezanne?I need the gauzeHe's going to be fine. GEOFFREY appears in the door with the book on Cezanne.He lets you call him Woody? Nobody's called him Woody in years. THEY come intoWhat makes it valuable is Kandinsky painted on either side of the canvas in two wildly different styles. One side is geometric and somr=r. The other side is wild and vivid.We flip it around for variety. OUISA happily turns the painting back and forth to show off its two sides. The SCREEN is filled with the bright colors then the dark colors.Wassily Kandinsky. Born 1866 Moscow. Blue Rider Exhibition 1914. He said \"It is clear that the choice of object that is one of the elements in the harmony of form must be decided only by a corresponding vibration in the human soul\". Died 1944 France. JULIA nods. Ah yes.Out West, he said.What's he directing?Don't be snooty.Well, yes. Years ago.Surely they can't make the movie of Cats.Animation would be nice.May we ask who --And he told us.Don't say it. We're trying to keep this abstract. Plus libel laws.Out to dinner.A frozen steak from the Ice Age.Two. Two at Harvard. A daughter at Groton.What are they supposed to say? We've become friends with the son of Sidney Poitier, barrier breaker of the fifties and sixties?We watched him cook.He sort of did wizardryLeft avers - tuna fish - olives - onions - It's all dazzling and rapid. FLAN opens the wine. OUISA takes dishes and silver out and hands them to GEOFFREY. EVERYONE is in a picnic spirit. PAUL fills a large pot with water from the tap. PAULOh, please. PAUL pours a brandy.Isn't he from Jamaica? There's a taste of--I am astonished!The more for us! THEY all laugh. PAUL leaves the room abruptly. FLAN, OUISA and GEOFFREY look at each other. FLAN stands.Hello? PAUL returns with the rest of the real in brightly painted bowls.Geoffrey, Harvard has all those great titles the students give courses.Krauts and Doubts.Blunt question. What's he like?I'm not a star fucker.And then we asked him what his thesis was on.I haven't read it in years. OUISA shushes FLAN.I hope your muggers read every word.Where will you stay?There's an alarm by the bedIt's only a problem if you leave. PAUL takes the alarm and sets the time.And we want to be in Cats.That's very important. It has to be in our contracts. We are humans.Forget it. It was only an evening at home.He's in.He's in for two million.He says the Cezanne is a great inv1stment. We should get it for six million and sell it to the Tokyo bunch for ten.Figure it out. He doesn't have the price of -a dinner but he can cough up two million dollars and the Japs will go ten! PAUL and OUISA come into the living room.Geoffrey sold that Hockney print I know he bought for a hundred bucks fifteen years ago for thirty four thousand dollars. Sotheby took their cut, sure but still--Two million! Wildest dreams. Paul, I should give you a commission.People want to sell privately. Not go through a gallery.But don't want museums to know where it is.I've got Japanese looking for a Cezanne. I have a syndicate that will buy the painting. There is this great second level Cezanne coming up for sale in a very messy divorce. FLAN holds up the slide.I needed an extra two million. Geoffrey called. Invited him here for dinner.Then we'll say our good nights now.Take fifty dollars.A strike. Air controllers.And you saved us a fortune. Do you know what our bill would've been at that little Eye-tie store front?Fifty dollars. FLAN hands PAUL the money. PAUL hesitates, then takes it.You see how easy it is.I want to get on my knees and thank god -money-I don't want to lose our life here. I don't want all the debt to pile up and crush us.For a while. We almost lost it. If I didn't get this money,. Ouis, I would've lost the Cezanne. It would've gone. I had nowhere to get it. OUISA gets out of bed and comes to FLAN.I don't want to worry you.There is a god.Geoffrey?This is what I dreamt. I didn't dream so much as realize this. I felt so close to the paintings. I wasn't just selling like pieces of meat. I remembered why I loved paintings in the first place - what had got me into this - and I thought - dreamed - remembered-How easy it is for a painter to lose a painting. He can paint and paint - work on a canvas for months and one day he loses it - just loses the structure - loses the sense of it - you lose the painting. A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT shines on FLAN who turns to see A TEACHER, in her forties, very pure and happy, hanging beautiful and brilliantly colored children's drawings in the air. FLAN'S VOICE echoes in this vast space.Why are all your students geniuses in the second grade? Look at the first grade. Blotches of green and black. Look at third grade. Camouflage. But the second grade --your grade. Matisses everyone. You've made my child a Matisse. Let me study with you. Let me into the second grade! What is your secret?What is it?! FLAN AND OUISA step out intoOh my God! THE HUSTLER stretches out on the sofa.You brought this thing into our house! Thing! Thing! Get out! Get out of my house! FLAN picks up the HUSTLER'S clothes and opens the front door.Take your clothes. Go back to sleep in the gutter. FLAN flings the clothes out intoMake sure they go out!Give me my fifty dollars.Make sure they leave. By the back door. PAUL steps into the elevator. The door shuts.Well, it's notI am shaking.it's awful.How can I look? I'm shaking.Would you concentrate on yourself?Calm down.The silver Victorian inkwell.There's the inkwell. Silver beaver. Why?And there's the watercolor. Our dog. FLAN pets his dog.we're alive. THEY sit on the sofa, drained, holding onto the phone. The phone suddenly rings. THEY clutch each other.Hello?Two hundred and fifty thousand?Yes. It sounds a wonderful idea.No! We'll call!No need to thank. See you shortly.My lawyer.Safe trip.Let me tell you our story.Last night. We are still zonked.That was no burglar.Did you give him money?Let's go back to our place.\"To thank you for a wonderful time. Paul Poitier.'\" FLAN reaches into the bouquet. HE takes out a p.t of jam.A pot of jam?He cooked us dinner.He said he was the son of Sidney Poitier.We gave him fifty dollars.He left.You can't chuck us out.Yes, there is another chapter.--the details he knew--how would he know about the painting? FLAN has taken the Kandinsky off the wall and flipped it around to the wild side.Although I think it's a very fine Kandinsky. FLAN leans the painting against a chair and studies it.And jam .Tess, when you see your little sister, don't tell her that Paul and the hustler used her bed.It's not a conspiracy. It's a family. THE ELEVATOR DOOR opens. TESS and FLAN virtually growl at each other as the door shuts on TESS.And a new character entered our storyVery courageous.Five Sherlock Holmeses-There's a picture of him and his four- daughters. No sons. Four daughters.The book's called This Life.Agatha Christie would ask what do we all have in common?We'll take a vote. Do we pursue this to the end no matter what we find out about our kids?Yes. KITTY looks through the Poitier autobiography.We all went up to Harvard.It's obvious. It's somebody you went to High School with, since you go to different colleges.Who in your high school, part of your gang, has become homosexual or is deep into drugs?We have not invested all this money in you to scale the face of K-2. TESS leans across the table, matching them whisper for whisper.Nobody is accusing anyone of anything. I'm asking you to go on a detective search and find out from your high school class if anyone has met a Black kid pretending to be a movie star's son.No, I think that was Starlight Express -Finally, we hear from the peanut gallery. And WOODY screams at THEM in rage, his voice echoing, mindless of the STUDENTS who freeze in the background as you would at a traffic accident.Three months! The chimes ring, signalling the start of the opera.No. No news.Nothing. All quiet. Thank god. THEY pass out of the box intoAlways wanted to meet them! Of course we'l1 call. As soon as we get to Rome! What fun!Rome is always remarkable but to see - Columns flash past. The blurring clears and we are movingthe Sistine Chapel like this!This is staggering! THEY step out, in great excitement, right ontoThey restored it after all these years - FOUR ITALIAN WORKERS scrub away at the ceiling a few feet above them. They refer constantly to banks of computers operated by TWO JAPANESE.and years of smoke and tourists and it's brand new!The colors are vibrant!No. It's not important -We stepped out of the taxi from the airport andDarling, they don't have to know every detail.What about my son?The negro son?No! The cops brought this young girl to us!- all over the building that I had abandoned some mistake of my past in Central Park! THE COUPLE gasps!Can't you just see me marching down South for Freedom Now!It was so embarrassing.To high dudgeon! THEY all toast. But OUISA has stopped laughing.They danced. That's right! High over New York City.Now the amazing part isWe were in the roller disco that night! ANDREW and JEANNIE's jaws drop.It was illiteracy.We came outside giddy and reelingBecause the blood seeping out had not yet reached the gutter...The boy had jumped from above.He could've landed on us! ANDREW and JEANNIE are appalled. No! OUISA frowns.We'll trap him. I'll release it to the papers. I can call the New York Times. I have friends. They'll publish the story. Someone will see it. And turn him in. We'll find Paul.I'll send you the clipping.No.No.We are bidding tonight on an Henri Matisse.It's a second level Matisse -They'll go as high as -Well over 25 million.Ugh. Bring back the 80s. I'll have to give most of it away, but the good part is it gives me a credibility in this new market. It's all out of whack. Everything's up. Everything's down. I mean, a David Fucking Hockney print sold for a hundred bucks fifteen years ago went for Thirty four thousand dollars! A print! A flower. You know Geoffrey. our South African - OUISA shushes FLAN. THEY have arrived atThe Matisse will be mine - for a few hours Then off to Tokyo Off to Saudi OUISA is on the speaker phone with TESS while she is dressing for the auction.Honey, could you give me a hand with-- OUISA It's Paul. FLAN goes to the other phone.I'll call that detective. The other phone line rings. FLAN picks it up.Darling, could you call back -We cannot talk about this now -Are you nuts! Tell a crook we're going out. The house is empty.The key's under the mat! PAUL is as cheery as HE can be.Thank him - he was very help - OUISA hands FLAN the phone.Paul? You were helpful getting me that money for the Cezanne. You impressed Geoffrey -You only see the glam side of it. There's a whole grotty side that -You have to have art history. You have to have language. You have to have economics -No, it's not really a profession you hand down from generation to gen - what the hell at I talking career counselling to you! You embarrassed me in my building! You stole money. There is a warrant out for your arrest.' OUISA Don't hang up! Paul? Are you there? Paul! You made him hang up -Oh fuck. We have drinks with the Japanese at six- fifteen - Get off that fucking phone. Is it that kid? Get him out of our life! Get off that phone or I'll rip it out of the wall! OUISA Paul, I made a mistake. It is not the Germans. We will come right now and get you. Where are you? Tell me? I'll take you to the police. They will treat you with dignity.It did not! Clearly OUISA is as disturbed by the telling of the events as FLAN is energized.We called our new best friend, the detective.Well, Ouisa did.We skipped the cocktailsWhat could we do? We tried.I'm sure it's not him.He'll be back. We haven't heard the last of him. The imagination. He'll find a way. Could we talk about something else? Our guest of honor tonight- it's such a pleasure to meet you- But.THE GUEST OF HONOR FROM THE UN leans forward.Like the papers said. We have hearts.Help him? He could've killed me. And you. THE GUESTS agree.Cut me out of that pathology! You are on your own -What are you saying, darling? OUISA looks at FLAN clinically. FLAN frowns and turns back to his dinner partner brightly.Cezanne would leave blank spaces in his canvasses if he couldn't account for the brush stroke, give a reason for the color.What kind of behavior is -Do you realize how important this woman is! SHE steps in the elevator. FLAN follows.Are you drunk? What are you unhappy about? The Cezanne sale vent through. The Matisse went through. We are rich. Geoffrey's rich. Next month there's a Bonnard and after that -- life can I account for! All! I am a gambler!

Bottle of beer. Bottle of beer. AN UNSEEN YOUNG MAN OFF CAMERA speaks - elegant phrasing.Bottle- of beer.I'm so sorry to bother you, but I've been hurt- and I've lost everything and I didn't know where to go. Your children-- I'm a friend of --They took my money and my brief case. I said my thesis is in there - PAUL looks down. HE sees the blood seeping through his shirt.I get this way around blood. FLAN Not on the rug. Eddie, get the doctor-- EDDIE turns to leave.No! I'll survive. Please. No doctors - PAUL, frightened, looks at FLAN. FLAN We'll call if we need any - FLAN helps PAUL out of the room down the hall.I don't mind the money. But in this age of mechanical reproduction they managed to get the only copy of my thesis.Owww!Your children said you were kind. All the kids were sitting around the dorm one night dishing the- shit out of their parents. But your kids were silent and said No, not our parents. Not Flan and Ouisa. Not the Kittredges. The Kittredges are kind. So after the muggers left, I looked up and saw these Fifth Avenue apartments. Mrs. Onassis lives there. I know the Babcocks live over there. The Auchinclosses live there. But you lived here. I came here. OUISA, so touched, turns to FLAN and GEOFFREY.But your kids - I love them. Talbot and Woody mean the world to me.They described this apartment in detail. This is a Kandinsky! - a double. One painted on either side. May I see - ? OUISA lifts the painting off the wall and turns it around. Even GEOFFREY is taken by the painting.It's wonderful. OUISA leans the painting against a chair, the chaotic side showing.It's the way they said it would be.As a matter of fact. No. Your kids and I...we both liked our parents... loved our--Look, am I getting in the way? I burst in here, hysterical. Blood. I didn't mean to--- FLAN and OUISA No!Well, fine. It's just there. Everyone's in a constant state of luxurious despair and constant discovery and paralysis.Although I've lived all over. My folks are divorced. He's remarried. He's doing a movie.He's directing this one but he does act.Cats.You've'seen it? T.S. Eliot--They're going to try. My father'll be hereHe's going to use people.They thought of lots of ways to go. Animation.But he found a better way. As a matter of fact, he turned it down at first. He went to tell the producers - as a courtesy - all the reasons why you couldn't make a movie of Cats and in going through all the reasons why you couldn't make a movie of Cats, he suddenly saw how you could make a movie of Cats --Sidney Poitier, the future Jackie Robinson of films, was born the twenty fourth of February 1927 in Miami during a visit his parents made to Florida - legally? -to sell tomatoes they had grown on their farm in the Bahamas. He grew up on Cat Island, \"so poor they didn't even own dirt\" he has said. Neglected by his family, my father would sit on the shore, and, as he told me many times, \"conjure up the kind of worlds that were on the other side and what I'd do in them.\" He arrived in New York City from the Bahamas in the winter of 1943 at age fifteen and a half and lived in the pay toilet of the bus station across from the old Madison Square Garden at Fiftieth and Eighth Avenue. He moved to the roof of the Brill building, commonly known as Tin Pan Alley. Washed dishes at the Turf restaurant for $4.11 a night. He taught 0 himself to read by reading the newspaper. In the Black newspaper, the theater page was opposite the Want Ad page. Among his 42 films are No Way Out 1950/ Cry the Beloved Country 1952/ Blackboard Jungle 1955/ The Defiant Ones 1958/ Raisin in the Sun 1961/ Lilies of the Field 1963/ In the Heat of the Night 1967/ To Sir With Love 1967/ Shoot to Kill 1988 and, of course,He won the Oscar for Lilies of the Field and was twice named top male box-office star in the country. My father made no films from 1977 to 1987 but worked as director and author. Dad said to me once \"I still don't fully understand how all that came about in the sequence it came about\". And we hear the OFF SCREEN PRESENCE applauding. PAUL bows, happily. HE kicks his shoe off into the camera.Dad's not in till tomorrow at the Sherry. I came down from Cambridge. Thought I'd stay at some fleabag for adventure. Orwell. Down and Out. I really don't know New York. I know Rome and Paris and Los Angeles a lot better.Out to dinner?But why go out to dinner?You must have something in the fridge.Why spend a hundred dollars on a bowl of rice? Let me into the kitchen. Cooking calms me. What I'd like to do is calm down, pay back your kids-- who've been wonderful to me.I'm glad of that. Dad and I went to Russia once to a film festival and he was truly amazed how much his presence meant -I wish.If I wanted to write a book about him. I really can't. No one would want to read it. He's decent. I admire him.No! We're all good friends now. . His kids from that marriage. Us - the old kids. I'd love to get in that kitchen. FLAN What should we do?My dad took me to a movie shot in South Africa. The camera moved from this vile rioting in theit makes you realize that the 'crummy childhood' theory, that everything can be blamed in a Freudian fashion on the fact that you've had a bad upbringing, just doesn't hold water. May I?My problem is I've never felt American. I grew up in Switzerland. Boarding school. Villa Rosey.That's not me. I've never felt people liked me for my connections. Movie star kid problems. None of those. THE WATER boils. HE dumps in pasta. The microwave timer goes off. PAUL removes the glass dish.But I never knew I was black in that racist way 0 till I was sixteen and came back here. Very protected. White servants. After the divorce we moved to Switzerland. My mother, brother and Z. I don't feel American. I don't even feel black. I suppose that's very lucky for me even though Freud says there's no such thing as luck. Just what you make. PAUL takes the pasta off the boil and drains it, plopping the pasta into a brightly colored bowl. OUISA, FLAN and GEOFFREY sit at the counter, transfixed.Here's dinner. All ready.Is everything okay? FLAN, OUISA and GEOFFREY Mmrmmm .. yes.My father insisted we learn to cook.Yes. Before he made it, he ran four restaurants in Harlem. You have good buds!The cook never eats.Seconds? THEY laugh and are served.You're like all parents. What's your major?My father, being an actor, has no real identity. You say to him, Pop, what's new? And he says, 'I got an interesting script today. I was asked to play a lumberjack up in the Yukon. Now, I've been trained as a Preacher, but my church fell apart. My wife says we have to get mbney to get through this winter. And I sign up as part of this team where all my beliefs are challenged. But I hold firm. In spite of prejudice because I want to get back to my wife. Out of this forest,back to the church... .' And my father is in tears and I say Pop, this i:. not a real event, this is some script that was sent to you. And my father says ' I' m trying it out to see how it fits on me.' But he has no life--he has no memory--only the scripts producers send him in the mail through his agents. That's his past.Well... (HE takes a deep breath and leans back inI borrowed a copy from a young friend of mine because I wanted to see what she had underlined and I read this book to find out why this touching, beautiful, sensitive story published in July 1951 had turned into this manifesto of hate. I started reading. : It's exactly as I remembered. Everybody's a phoney. Page two: \"My brother's in Hollywood being a prostitute.\" Page three: \"what a phony slob his father was.\" Page nine: \"People never notice anything.\" Then on page twenty two my hair stood up. Remember Holden Caulfield--the definitive sensitive youth--wearing his red hunter's cap. \"A deer Hunter hat? Like hell it is. I sort of closed one eye like I was taking aim at it. This is a people shooting hat. I shoot people in this hat.\"Hmmm, I said. This book is preparing people for bigger moments in their lives than I ever dreamed of. Then on p. 89 \"I'd rather push a guy out the window or chop his head off with an ax than sock him in the jaw. I hate fist fights...what scares me most is the other guy's face...\" I finished the book. It's a touching story, comic because the boy wants to do so much and can't do anything. Hates all phoniness and only lies to others. Wants everyone to like him, is only hateful, and is completely self involved. In other words, a pretty accurate picture of a male adolescent. FLAN, OUISA, .GEOFFREY are transfixed. And what alarms me about that book--not the book so much as the aura about it--is this: the book is primarily about paralysis. The boy can't function. And at the end before he can run away and start a new life, it starts to rain and he folds. Now there's nothing wrong in writing about emotional and intellectual paralysis. It may indeed thanks to Chekhov and Samuel Beckett be the great modern theme. The extraordinary last lines of Waiting For Godot--\"Let's go.\" \"Yes, let's go.\" Stage directions: They do not move. But the aura around this book of Salinger's-- which perhaps should be read by everyone ut young men---is this: It mirrors like a fun house mirror and amplifies like a distorted speaker one of the great tragedies of our times- --the death of the imagination. Because what else is paralysis? The CAMERA moves closer and closer in on PAUL.The imagination has been so debased that imagination--being imaginative-- rather than being the lynch pin of our existence now stands as a synonym for something outside ourselves like Science fiction or some new use for tangerine slices on raw pork chops---what an imaginative summer recipe--and Star wars! So imaginative and Star Trek--so imaginative! And Lord of the Rings--all those dwarves--soI'll test you. I should be going. PAUL starts to go. THEY follow. THE DINING ROOM opens intoI get into the Sherry tomorrow morning. It's not so far off. I can walk around. I don't think they'll mug me twice in one evening. FLAN and OUISA take's PAUL's by the arm and leads him down the hall intoNo! I have to be at the hotel at seven AM sharp!or Dad will have a fit.If it's any problem--Six fifteen? I'll tip toe out.It's done. THEY shake hands.He's not. Dad said I could be in charge of the extras. You'd just be extras. That's all I can promise.No. You can be humans.Did I intrude? FLAN and OUISA No!I'm sorry - Oh Christ - GEOFFREYNobody comes in on Sunday. PAUL snuffs out the candles with his fingers.You'll have every bug in Christendom - The room is dark, -lit only from the living room. THEY both reach for the dishes.No. You watch. It gives me a thrill to be looked at. PAUL looks at HER. OUISA is momentarily at a loss. PAUL goes into the kitchen. The service door into the kitchen swings back and forth.Two million dollars? FLAN runs intoGo to ten? Ten million?Nothing?Your kids said you were an art dealer. But you don't have a gallery. I don't understand -I couldn't tell -I'm glad I helped -I'm so pleased I was wonderful. All this and a pink shirt.It's going to be time for me to get up.Oh Christ. Regretfully. I4l1 tip toe. PAUL and OUISA follow FLAN intoDon't need it.But I'll get it back to you tomorrow. I want my father to meet you.Could I?I can explain.Please. Don't tell my father. I don't want him to know. I haven't told him. I got. so lonely. I got so afraid. My dad coming. I had the money. I went out after we went to sleep and I brought him back. You had so much. I couldn't be alone. I was so afraid. I am so sorry.I can explain!I spent it.I'm so sorry. THE HUSTLER is in the elevator, pulling on his seedy clothes.The imagination. That's our out. Our imagination teaches us our limits and then how to grow beyond those limits. The imagination says listen to me. I at your darkest voice. .I am your 4am voice. I am the voice that wakes you up and says this is what I'm afraid of. Do not listen to me at your peril. The imagination is the noon voice that sees clearly and says yes this is what I want for my life. It's there to sort out your nightmare, to show you the exit from the maze of-your nightmare, to transform the nightmare into dreams that become your bedrock. If we don't listen to that voice, it dies. It shrivels. It vanishes. The imagination is not our escape. on the contrary, the imagination is the place we are all trying to get to. PAUL lifts his shirt and stabs himself. OUISA screams. PAUL falls over backward into space. The phone rings, waking OUISA. FLAN picks up the phone. OUISA sits up, a little stunned. She is relieved to find things so normal.I don't know how to thank you, sir. My father is coming here.Doug's told me all about your brownstone. How you got it at a great price because there had been a murder in it and for a while people thought it had a curse but you were a scientific man and were courageous!Pardon?Breaking and entering?Officer, your honor, your eminence, Dr. Fine cave me the keys to his brownstone. Isn't that so?This man gave me the keys to the house. Isn't that so? THE COP puts his gun away.What's this? PAUL speaks.street talk speech. Hardly what we've heard.All these names. Addresses. Tell me about these people. TRENT lies along side PAUL.Tell me about these people, man!Are these all rich people? TRENT sits up in bed.I think it must be very hard to be with rich people. You have to have money. You have to give them presents.That's what pots of jam are for?I'll tell you what I'll do. I pick a name. You tell me about them. Where they live. Secrets. And for each name you get a piece of clothing.Kittredge. Talbot and Woodrow.A Kan--what- ski?That's enough for today. PAUL takes his shoes and the address book and goes.Bodd-ill a bee-ya.I was hallucinating from not eating-Do they have any black people in Utah?My gosh! ELIZABETH stands up and declaims.Like the painters. Cezanne looked for the rules behind the spontaneity of Impressionism.My dad loves painting. He has a Kandinsky but he loves Cezanne the most. He lives up there.He lives up there. Count six windows over. John Flanders Kittredge. His chums-call him Flan. I was the child of Flan's hippie days. His radical days. He went down South as a freedom marcher, to register black voters - his friends were killed. Met my mother. Registered her and married her in a fit of sentimental righteousness and knocked her up with me and came back here and abandoned her. Went to Harvard. He's now a fancy art dealer. Lives up there. Count six windows over. Won't see me. The new wife--the white wife-- The Louisa Kittredge Call Me Ouisa wife - the mother of the new children wife--They go to Andover and Exeter and Harvard and Yale. The awful thing is my father started out good. My mother says there is a good man inside s J. Flanders Kittredge.I call him. He hangs up.He doesn't have an office. He works out of there. They won't even let me in the elevator.I don't want to embarrass him. Look, this is so fucking tacky.Live? I'm,home. PAUL picks up two plastic shopping bags which are filled with clothing.You're such assholes. Where would I live? PAUL shrugs his shoulders and leaves. RICK and ELIZABETH look at each other then follow him down the path leading through the park to the carousel. THE CAROUSEL calliope plays merrily.This is the way you must speak. Hear my accent. Hear my voice. Never say you're going horse back riding. You say You're going Riding. And don't say Couch. Say Sofa. And you say bodd-ill. It's bottle. Say bottle of beer.Bottle of beer. And never be afraid of rich people. You know what they love? A fancy pot of jam. That's all. Get yourself a patron. That's what you need. You shouldn't be waiting tables. You're going to wake up one day and the temporary job you picked up to stay alive is going to be your full time life. ELIZABETH is struck by his advice and embraces PAUL gratefully.He wrote me! I wrote him and he _ wrote me back! He's going to give me a thousand dollars! And that's just for starters! He sold a Cezanne to the Japanese and made millions and he can give me money without her knowing it. PAUL lets out a whoop and leaps up onto the bed with RICK and ELIZABETH in it and begins jumping up and down.I'm moving out of here!But I am going to give you the money to put on a showcase of any play you want and you'll be in it and agents will come see you and you'll be seen and you'll be started. And when you win your Oscars - both of you - you'll look in the camera and thank me - ELIZABETH loves the moment and weeps her acceptance speech.One hitch. I'm going to meet him in Maine. He's up there visiting his parents in Dark Harbor. My grandparents whom I've never met. He's finally going to tell my grandparents about me. He's going to make up for lost time. He's going to give me money. I can go back home. Get my momma that beauty parlor she's wanted all her life. One problem. How am I going to get to Maine? The wife checks all the bills. He has to account for the money. She handles the purse strings. Where the hell am I going to get two hundred and fifty dollars to get to Maine?I'll be gone a week. But I could wire it back to you.Look. No problem. I understand.He does. It'll work out. Hey. Posture. Stand up straight. Don't slump. Attitudes of defeat. ELIZABETH kisses PAUL and looks at sullen RICK and leaves.Stick with me, baby. I know the right name to drop.She'll have it back. With interest. Wonderful bouquet. Bouquet. That's what you call the taste of the wine. And I believe that wine from the even numbered years is generally the superior to the odd numbered years. Although it's just a theory - Cheers! Skol! Prosit!Do you want to dance?Every moment in life is a learning experience or what good is it? Right? Right?Then let this bunch of jerks see class.Amigo! When will you learn! Money is one commodity you can always get. THE HANSOM CARRIAGE proceeds up to Central Park. RICK leans forward looking out the isinglass windows.I was wondering if I could fuck you. RICK laughs. Then sees PAUL is serious.That's what makes it so nice. You don't.Hello?I saw the story in the paper. I didn't know the boy killed himself. He gave me the money. I didn't steal any -If you put me on hold, I'll be gone and you'll never hear from me again. OUISA pauses.Would you help me?Stay with you.Why?Do you?I do not have it. It's a miracle. But I don't. Do you feel I betrayed you? If you do, I'll hang up and never bother you again -Travelling.No, I only visited you. I didn't like the first people so much. They went out and just left me alone. I didn't like the doctor. He was too eager to please. And he left me alone. But you. You and your husband. We all stayed together.Everlasting friendship.You do.You're going to tell me secrets? You're not what you appear to be? You have no secrets. Trent Conway told me what your kids have told him over the years.I don't tell that. I save that for blackmail.No! I went to a museum! I liked Toulouse-Lautrec!I read the Andy Warhol Diaries.Are you laughing at me?I read The Agony and the Ecstasy by Irving Stone about Michelangelo painting the Sistine Chapel.Have you seen the Sistine Chapel?You've been to the top of the Sistine Chapel? PAUL leans into the phone, amazed, as the screen floods with the brightly colored ceiling of theYou slapped God's hand!No!Take me to see it?Who's there?I come there and you'll have the cops waiting.Why?Who's there?Are you in tonight? I could come and make a feast for you.Where are you going?Hi! Can I come to Sotheby's? FLAN thrusts the phone back to OUISA.I said hi to Flan.That's wonderful! I'll come!Why? I was helpful last time -Really! I was thinking maybe that's what I should do is what you do - in art but making money out of art and meeting people and not working in an office -I could learn the grotty -I'm here.If you let me stay with you, I'll tell you. That night was the happiest night I ever had. OUISA It was the happiest night he ever had.You let me use all the parts of myself that night - OUISA opens the door into the DINING ROOM.Graduation speech at Groton two years ago.Other people's recipes. Did you see Donald Harthleme's obituary? He said Collage was the art form of the 20th century.Not your children. Not your life. SHE walks around the empty dining room table.You don't sound happy. SHE walks back into the LIVING ROOM.Never say I'm stupid -What could I be?With you behind me?No.I was so happy. I wanted to add sex to it. Don't you do that? OUISA looks into the MASTER BEDROOM and goes in.I'll tell you my name.It's Paul Poitier-Kittredge. It's a hyphenated name. SHE sits on her bed.Start what?Will you help me? OUISA stands up.Will you send me books and polaroids of you and cassettes? And letters?Will you visit me?And when you do, you'll wear your best clothes and knock em dead? SHE's in the LIVING ROOM.I won't have sex in prison. I only have sex when I'm happy.Will you take me?I'll be treated with care if you take me to the police. If they don't know you're special, they kill you.Mrs. Louisa Kittredge, I am black.And I'll plead guilty and go to prison and serve a few months.Then I'll come out and work for you and learn -I want to know now.Learn all the trade. Not just the grotty part.And live with you.Your kids are away.You'll help me find a place?I have no furniture.I made a list of things I liked in the museum. Philadelphia Chippendale.I'd rather have one nice piece than a room full of junk.All I have to do is go to the police.Tonight.Bring me?I have black tie from a time I went to the Rainbow Room. Have you ever been to the Rainbow Room?What time do you have to be there?It's five thirty now. You could come get me now and take me to the police tonight and then go to Sotheby's--Japanese?You're just like my father.Sidney!I'm in the lobby of the Waverly movie theater on Sixth Avenue and Third Street.I'll give you fifteen minutes grace time.Ouisa., I love you. Ouisa Kittredge. Hey? Bring a pink shirt.The Kandinsky is painted on both sides. DUISA is startled.

OUISA stops doing what she's doing which is rolling out a drink trolley with little hors d'oeuvres on plates. FLAN stops doing what he's doing which is checking that a slide projector is in place on the desk along side the silver beaver inkwell. FLAN and OUISA both tense.It always amazes me when New York is so quiet. OUISA and FLAN relax and laugh.One has to stay there to educate the black workers and we'll know we've been successful when they kill us.You don't think of it like that. I wish you'd come visit. OUISA takes her drink and strokes the ears of her dog.Oy vay China. As my grandmother would say. Our role in history. And we offer ourselves upWonderful view.Where should we?God! The restaurants! New York has become the Florence of the Sixteenth Century. Genius on every corner.The new Italian looked cheery. FLAN and OUISA Good.You have to come to South Africa so I can pay you back. I'll take you on my plane into the Okavango Swamps -Elephants? FLAN rapidly steers GEOFFREY to a chair, closes the living room door, then wheels a projector with a carousel tray into place.It's been wonderful seeing you--My time is so short. Before I leave America, I really should call -Lovely book. FLAN looks stricken.Agreed. FLAN beams.My god!Did you bitch your parents?Don't mock. SHE kisses GEOFFREY.Your father means a great deal in South Africa.You wish?I vote - stay in. OUISA, FLAN and PAUL Good!Johannesburg. PAUSE. PAUL Studies GEOFFREY. OUISA and FLAN freeze. Is it a tense moment? PAUL takes a breath. PAUL puts the water on the fire, eyes never off GEOFFREY. Then PAUL resumes chopping onions briskly and dropping them into the frying pan.What about being black in America? PAUL scoops a melange of vegetables into a glass dish and puts it in the microwave.This is the best pasta I've ever -The islands.See? Good buds. I've never been complimented on my buds-To Cats!The one that was stolen. Please?I'm going to buy a copy of Catcher i. the Rye at the airport and read it.I'll fly back.
