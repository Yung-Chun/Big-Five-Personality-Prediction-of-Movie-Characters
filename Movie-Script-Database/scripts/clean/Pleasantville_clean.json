I just don't know you ... technically.Well--I was just wondering--'cause I see you all the time in Algebra and I heard you humming that Van Halen song and I really like that song too ... Anyhow, I don't know what you're doing this weekend but my Mom's leaving town and she said I could use her car so ...Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?Marmalade.Okay--here's one: Why did their parents come home early from their weekend at the lake?'Cause Bud didn't answer the phone and they were worried about him.Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.... He's not homeless Howard, they just don't say where he lives. Well it's a silly question. Because nobody's homeless in Pleasantville.... because that's just not what it's like.Listen Howard--it's almost six-thirty. I gotta go.What are you doing?Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.Yeah. Every episode ever.Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.Oh my God ... Oh my God ...No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It doesn't work without a remote.Yeah ... Sort of ...You know, we didn't call any TV repair.The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.... Her father....

Are we in that episode?I don't believe it.You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...Lucky guess. Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ...What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little \"different\" lately ...I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...Look, I'm sure we'll work something out. I'll talk to her or something.Honest. It'll be fine.One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.What?What were you doing in a library?JENNIFER!Jen, listen ...I'll get us out of here. I really will.

I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...What's wrong?Yeah ...I'm sorry.You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.I understand.Peppermint shake, chocolate soda, two orders of fries and a split?What?Listen to me!Do you have the lettuce?Have you cooked the burgers?Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.Really.

It seems so fattening.Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...C'mere.What did you say?What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!Just listen to me ...Forget about that!Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.So they can have their hamburgers!... What's that?Wow ... That's pretty good ...I think you should try not to think about this anymore.Yeah.Oh my God!Jesus Christ ...FIRE! FIRE!FIRE ... FIRE ...CAT!!!Right here!Here! Grab this nozzle.Just grab it!Okay!

You baked those for Whitey.No. You baked them for Whitey.Um ... thanks.It's okay.It's fine.Sure.How you doin?What?Well--where I used to live ... That's just what firemen did.Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.It's really not important.Well ... There are some places where the road doesn't go in a circle. There are some places where it keeps on going.Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...... What?I thought the books were blank?The pages filled in?Well, yeah ... I do.Well--see ... they're both running away--Huck and the slave ... And ... They go up the river ... But--in trying to get free they sort of see that they're free already.Oh my God.Hunh? Oh yeah ... Well this is great. See--Holden Caulfield is like this really lonely kid...I'll get her.Are you okay?Are you alright?It's okay. It's alright.Have you got any make up?Okay--first we'll dry you out a little.Looks just like it did.No ... They won't be able to tell.Wait.It's fine.Sure.Hi.I brought you something ... From the library.It's an art book.Open it.I just thought since you liked painting it might help to ...What's wrong?Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...Hi.Look, I probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ...It's just that my folks are gonna stay home and they said I could use their car. ... You want to go out with me tonight?... Lover's Lane?Sorry ...\"Oh when the Saints ... Go Marching in ...\"... Hi.I can't.Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my \"dad\" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...Re-runs?Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just \"cookies\" after all ...Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?Terrific. I'll talk to you then.Nothing.Listen ...You're reading?... Yeah.That's great.Well ... I just ... Can I ask you a question?Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?Wow.Yes.What?Oh, I don't know. Maybe ... ... it's not just the sex ...Oh ... Right.Wow.What's that smell?Mmmmgh.Yeah ... I guess. I don't know.What?Oh. don't know ... It's different.Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...Yeah.Well it's big. And it's blue ... ... It's really really blue.Hunh?They just grow like that?Rain.Yeah ... You don't have rain either?Right. Of course you don't ...We'll just put up the top.It's fine. Come on.It's alright. There's nothing to be afraid of.I got you something.It was a prop for the school play ...Sure ...Hello Whitey.No reason. How come you're not?Why don't you guys just get the hell out of here.It's fine ... It doesn't mean anything.Oh--well ...What do you mean?Look--it just sort of \"happened\" ...I had nothing to do with that.Look ...... Only if they mean it.I didn't do anything wrong.Why?No you're not.I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.I'm going to leave now.Come on!COME ON!Get out of here!Are you alright?What?Come on.Oh my God.Are you alright? Are you okay?We should be okay up here.We better go.I'm not sure.Oh my God.It's okay. It's me.Let's go inside.Hello?Well he's right. Come on.

I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...I'm sorry. I can't do that.They weren't my memories. I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.I don't know ... Three, four weeks.I'm going on trial tomorrow?There's worse places.Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?Well--it was dark out ...It was accessible to everyone.I think I've got something to say.I think I know why you're doing this. I mean, I understand why you're doing this. I used to feel the same way. I used to want this place to stay just the way it was. I never wanted it to change ...But nothing stays the same. You get things, and you lose things, and that's the good part and the bad part--but you can't have a good part without a bad part.It's like the basketball team.Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.Wouldn't it feel better than when they used to win all the time?See, I know you want it to stay \"Pleasant\" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ... And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them. Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...I thought I was allowed to defend myself.I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you.Mr. Simpson ...What color is that hedge of yours?No, not that hedge. The other one.The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.What color is that hedge?Alright. Dad ...Don't you miss her?I mean, of course you do, but it isn't just the cooking or the cleaning that you miss--it's something else, isn't it ...Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too. You might even call it \"love.\"Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?Don't you wish you could tell her that?Why am I out of order?Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.Oh sure it is.What do you want to do to me right now?C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...But it could happen.Are you sure?This thing works. We could go home right now.Honestly ... no.You got the admissions letter.And you're sure about this?I'll come back and check on you in a month.No I won't.

Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.So what is it?Sure.Yeah ...No. She really liked you.Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.Can I ask you a question?How come I'm still in black and white?Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.What?No, it's not just the sex, is it?Hunh.What are you doing?So.Oh. I can't.I'm busy.I'm studying.Cool ...Oh my God ...Don't! Just let go.I said, NO! ... I've read like one book in my whole life and I'll be damned if I let you throw it on that fire ...Uch ...

TV busted?Well here I am.Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.We'll get you fixed up in no time.I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?What's the rush?Pleasantville?Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.Hey--who did Muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles?Right. And how did she dress him?Nice ... Nice ...Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?What department store did they go to?McGinty's.That's right.Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more \"Ooomph\" in it.Sure. Big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show.Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.Well, I better get going. Your show's almost on, and ... It's almost time for your date.Take care now.Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.A miracle.... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're in ... You know ...Dream come true, hunh?Well, you don't have to worry about that anymore.Why would I do that?Oh sure you do ... \"McIntire's Department store\" ... \"Their father dressed as Prince Charming.\" That was gorgeous Bud.You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.I'm very disappointed ... In fact ... I'm starting to get a little upset.Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know. I don't think I better talk about this right now.I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...Hello there.Well c'mere, young fella.You know I've been thinkin' ... I might have been a little \"hasty\" the other day when you asked to come home--just took me by such surprise, ya know--ha ha ...So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.What?Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey. ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.Excuse me?BUD.Bud ...I want a word with you ...NOW!What the hell do you think you're doing!What do I MEAN! You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...A deluge doesn't just \"happen.\" Bolts of lightning don't just \"happen\" ... You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!Oh no? Let me show you something!\"YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS PLACE.\"YOU DON'T DESERVE TO LIVE IN THIS PARADISE!Where's the remote control I gave you?Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.EXCUSE ME?JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!OW!You're not going anywhere. You're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!Don't make me get rough with you! I can get awfully fucking rough!Hope you're proud of yourself.Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?Because you're coming home.Oh. You're a smart little bastard aren't you? It's kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the same way you came.Just gimme the damn remote!I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ...How long do you think you've been here?Much less than that. An hour and a half.See--and this is really great-- the show was on for what--half an hour a week? So that means for every week that goes by in Pleasantville, only half an hour goes by in the real world.Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ... Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.This is TV pal. They don't fool around.Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.
