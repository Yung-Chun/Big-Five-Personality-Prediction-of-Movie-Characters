And if there is, they say it won't last a week.I saw.You heard him.Do you have news, sir, on my application for transfer?Sir. It was my understanding the medical corps was desperate for volunteers.I'm Inman.W. P. Inman.Repeating a thing doesn't improve it. People call me Inman.They're not my friends.Thank you.I work wood. Got a piece of land. Mostly work wood.I can clear a field.Not that comes to me. I'll say thank you for the lemonade.I'm wetter than a fish.I'm all right.If there's a war we'll all fight.Call a thing a war makes it a challenge to some men.Say again.You're laughing at me.You're always carrying a tray.I'll do that. I can't get much wetter.Reverend.I have some sheet music. Belonged to my father. No use to me.I should probably get along.I think so.Are you the law all of a sudden?You might be safer back in Charleston.I'm going to walk back inside the Chapel.Just some quiet.Ada...I'm not dying.Pigeon River. Little East Fork.Seems that way.Where'd you take your wound?What would you give for that? To have your eyeballs back for ten minutes?That's sure what seeing's done to me.Then we don't agree. There's not much I wouldn't give for ten minutes of someplace.Same difference.Hey! I'd pay a dollar for an egg. A piece of cheese.Don't let go. Just back up, nice and steady, do this all in reverse, you're going to end up with her draped back over your animal.I've killed several of them.What part of God's business is throwing a woman down a gorge.Is she dead?Where does she live?Shut your mouth. I don't want a sermon every time I ask a question.This your place?You're going to put her back where she sleeps.So you reckoned to kill her.You find me some paper and a pen.Sign says ferry, five dollars.What's the name of this thing?I can give you thirty dollars script.No. Get out.I should have shot you when I had the chance.You're nothing like me and the last thing I want right now is a conversation.Jesus, god!There's nowhere I'm going with you except to Hellfire!It's not yours. You take it, you make us another enemy. You're a Christian -- don' t you know your commandments?Then what?I don't know where he's heading. I'm going down the road. And I got a good way to go before nightfall.Give me that saw. Come on.Let's do this in chapters.You might want to leave off that water for a day or two.He's got a shit coming on. It's overdue.Like a Christian.He doesn't know what I am. Thanks.What?Like to wash their hands and pray.Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae.I'll say my goodbyes, got miles and miles to go before sunset. I'll just quickly lie down.He's dead.This man's dead!You run, we're all running with you, the lame and the stupid, of which we number both.Just give me some warning so I can tell the guard -- I'm not getting shot again for some cause I don't believe in.No!Fighting.Different fighting.Mister -- you could fix me I'd be in your everlasting debt.How long have I been sleeping?I can't stop here. I'm a deserter. They find me here things could be bad for you.How long you been up here?Last time I checked it was '64.Twenty six years!I could be at killing for days sometimes, in the hand to hand, my feet against the feet of my enemy and I always killed him and he never killed me.I guess he did.It's true...What you remember.Ada. -- Sometimes I think I'm crazy when I'm just hungry -- Ada Monroe.She was. I don't know. Or if she'd know me. I'm like the boy who goes out in winter for firewood comes back in the spring with a whistle.I've had to put myself in the way of people's kindness.The passenger pigeons fly south, the berries ripen. Whether I see them or not, whether a man dies, or a war is won.She gave me a book. Ada Monroe. Man by the name of Bartram. Wrote about his travels. I carried that book through every battle. I left it someplace, got to get it back. Sometimes just reading the name of a place near home -- Sorell Cove, Fire Scale Ridge -- was enough to bring me to tears. Thing is I've been thinking -- those places belonged to people before us, to the Indian -- and he had a different name. What did he call Sorell Cove? How can a name not even the real name break your heart? It's her, she's the place I'm heading. And I hardly know her. So how can a person who's maybe not even a real person -- I don't know what I'm talking about -- I have to close my eyes...I have a deal to thank you for.I'm one man alone. I'm a Confederate soldier on furlough. I have no bad intention. I need shelter and food.Can I at least sleep in the corn crib -- just for some shelter? I'll be on my way come morning.Fair enough.Thank you.No, I mean to give it to you.Is your baby sick?I'm sorry.There's no hunting on the road, just cress and --I could do that for you in the morning.It's what I'd gladly do for you for what you're gladly doing for me. I'm Inman by the way. That's my name.Glad to know you both.I got a blanket.Pretty much. These boots are good boots.Good night.I don't know. I'll try.I'll go. I'll go, shall I?I can try and fight them.Move away from the baby.Take off your boots. Take off your pants, and your shirt.You'd better get running before you catch your death of cold.Ada? Ada Monroe?Then I believe I made a mistake.If I knew where to go I'd go there.I may need to.Not lately.I'm sorry. I was trying to be quiet.-- I got no appetite left to be in a room with wounded men.It's not a face you recognised.I got three letters. Carried them in that book you gave me. The Bertram.Whenever I could. If you never got them I can summarize.I pray you're well. I pray I'm in your thoughts. You are all that keeps me from sliding into some dark place.A thousand moments. They're like a bag of tiny diamonds glittering in a black heart. Don't matter if they're real or things I made up. The shape of your neck. The way you felt under my hands when I pulled you to me.You're playing a piano and I'm standing outside.That kiss -- which I've kissed again every day of my walking.Maybe you can't see my face, but if you could see my inside, my whatever you want to name it, my spirit, that's the fear I have deeper than any gash on my neck. I think I'm ruined. They kept trying to put me in the ground, but I wasn't ready, no ma'am, no more ready than that scoundrel in there's not ready to die on us. But if I had goodness, I lost it. If I had anything tender in me I shot it dead.I'll say goodnight.Right.More a question could she put up with me.Sure.Ada, I want to marry you. If you'll have me.I marry you. I marry you. I marry you.Why's that funny?I can wait for you.Not for all the gold dollars in the Federal Bank.You go ahead. I'll follow with the horse at a pace your daddy can tolerate.It's safer this way. No one has quarrel with you.I gather I need permission if I reckon on living at Black Cove.We'll get to you by nightfall.Your Mr. Bartram speaks about some category of fly born on the hide of a cow. It flies up into a tree and waits and waits until it smells cow. It can wait a year, two years, I don't know, maybe longer. Then a cow comes along and it wakes up, flies down, lays its eggs on the cow. There's purpose for you.Don't look round.How many men does he have?I got a conversation stopper. Closer we get to that broken ground the better.You hold on tight, do you hear? When I say three, look round, nice and slow.One, two, three.Come out of there.I just have to shoot the horse from under you.I am.I hope so. Look, how old are you? Give me your gun and ride home, I'm done fighting. I'm sick of it.I will not shoot you, but nor am I walking down that mountain looking over my shoulder for you.What have you got on your side?", "clean_line": "works said cherokee won war won week saw heard news sir application transfer sir understanding medical corps desperate volunteers inman inman repeating thing improve people inman friends thank work wood got piece land work wood clear field comes ll thank lemonade wetter fish right war ll fight thing war makes challenge men laughing carrying tray ll wetter reverend sheet music belonged father use probably think law sudden safer charleston going walk inside chapel quiet ada dying pigeon river little east fork way wound eyeballs minutes sure seeing agree wouldn minutes someplace difference hey pay dollar egg piece cheese let nice steady reverse going end draped animal ve killed god business throwing woman gorge dead live shut mouth want sermon time ask question place going sleeps reckoned kill paper pen sign says ferry dollars thing thirty dollars script shot chance like thing want right conversation jesus god going hellfire enemy christian know commandments know heading going road got good way nightfall saw come let chapters want leave water day got shit coming overdue like christian know thanks like wash hands pray dolly lila shyla mae ll goodbyes got miles miles sunset ll quickly lie dead man dead run running lame stupid number warning tell guard getting shot cause believe fighting different fighting mister fix everlasting debt long sleeping stop deserter things bad long time checked years killing days hand hand feet feet enemy killed killed guess true remember ada think crazy hungry ada monroe know know like boy goes winter firewood comes spring whistle ve way people kindness passenger pigeons fly south berries ripen man dies war won gave book ada monroe man bartram wrote travels carried book battle left someplace got reading place near home sorell cove scale ridge bring tears thing ve thinking places belonged people indian different sorell cove real break heart place heading hardly know person maybe real person know talking close eyes deal thank man confederate soldier furlough bad intention need shelter food sleep corn crib shelter ll way come morning fair thank mean baby sick sorry hunting road cress morning gladly gladly inman way glad know got blanket pretty boots good boots good night know ll try ll ll shall try fight away baby boots pants shirt better running catch death cold ada ada monroe believe mistake knew need lately sorry trying quiet got appetite left room wounded men face recognised got letters carried book gave bertram got summarize pray pray thoughts keeps sliding dark place thousand moments like bag tiny diamonds glittering black heart matter real things shape neck way felt hands pulled playing piano standing outside kiss ve kissed day walking maybe face inside want spirit fear deeper gash neck think ruined kept trying ground wasn ready ma ready scoundrel ready die goodness lost tender shot dead ll goodnight right question sure ada want marry ll marry marry marry funny wait gold dollars federal bank ahead ll follow horse pace daddy tolerate safer way quarrel gather need permission reckon living black cove ll nightfall mr bartram speaks category fly born hide cow flies tree waits waits smells cow wait year years know maybe longer cow comes wakes flies lays eggs cow purpose look round men got conversation stopper closer broken ground better hold tight hear look round nice slow come shoot horse hope look old gun ride home fighting sick shoot walking mountain looking shoulder got"}, "ADA": {"raw_line": "Very much.

Inman.And what do you do?Clear fields?So, was there something in particular you wished to say to me?I've been missing it.Oh dear. And then he had nothing to say.Really?Men? I don't know. I don't even know what a woman should be like. In Charleston I was called a thistle, twice, by two different men. Both of them -- they were hunting for a simile, what was I like -- and thistle came right to them.Were you planning to come inside?There's a good fire going.Somebody said you were enlisting. Are you?If there's a mountain we'll all climb, if there's an ocean we'll all drown.Did you get a picture made?A tintype, with your gun and your courage on display.I don't know you.I'm taking a drink over to the negroes in the barn.Mr. Inman is more comfortable outdoors. Perhaps we might take a walk.Well, you have your war.But then who'll be waiting for you?And then there'll be a coffee or two, a brandy or two...I found you this book. William Bartram. They tell me it's good. I think he writes about these parts, the author, so...And this... I'm not smiling in it. I don't know how to do that, hold a smile, so now I'm solemn...What?What?Every time you see the doctor you get melancholy.He gives you alcohol and you get emotional.Yes. But then I've tried counting the number of words which passed between Mr. Inman and me. Is that a bonfire? So close to the barns.What's going on?No, Daddy, it's not real.I'll get help. Keep away from the flames.Amen. That was the last of the ham.I have to learn how to cook.I can't have people coming here and cooking for me!I'm not sorry, but I don't know how we'll get through another winter.Daddy, bring the tablecloth in with you!Daddy, come inside before you drown!Dear Mr. Inman...-- I'm still waiting, as I promised I would, but I find myself alone and at the end of my wits --Is there a letter for me?I know. Thank you so much.What do you hear?Thank you.Didn't somebody try?No.But not to volunteer for the war?You've got no spleen.I'd really prefer it if you didn't do that.I was raised in the good manners of the South where a gentleman doesn't enter a house with a woman alone.I'm sleeping fine.Should I imagine you are dead and, that it is to your spirit I am writing? No word from you in all this time. If you receive this please know I am here and warring, too, with a faint heart.I can't. I'm not -- I need to clean some clothes.I was saying to Sally, I wasn't expecting to be visiting, so...I don't expect -There are no people. And no money. My father had some bonds and investments. They're worthless now, of course, the war has... they're not worth anything. I love it here. In spite of everything.What kind of mirror?I don't know.Yesterday I found myself crouched over a well like a mad woman, which I suppose I have become-- and staring down into its secrets, I thought I saw you there, walking back to me ---- or wished I did.I don't know you.I need help, I need, I do need help, but I need a laborer -- there's plowing and rough work and -- I think there's been a misunderstanding.The rake?My plight?You're not a servant.Right.Right.Yes.The rake: there's a rooster devil, I'm sure of it. He's Lucifer himself. I go near him he's at me with his spurs.Yes. It's still dark.I have to eat something.A novel.Maul?I have no idea.Sixteen.What's a Gourd House?Actually, yes, I think we do.No. What? No. We bought our hams.I don't know. Locust?North is, North is --I can't! I can't! All right? I can talk about farming in Latin. Will that do? I can read French. I know Harmony and Counterpoint. I know my Bible. I can name the principal rivers of Europe, but don't ask me to name one stream in this county. I can embroider, but I can't darn, I can arrange cut flowers, but I can't grow them. If a thing has a function, if I might do something with it, it wasn't considered suitable.Ruby, you could ask why? about pretty much everything to do with me.This fence is about the first thing I've ever done that'll produce an actual result.Agricola poetis viam non monstrat.The farmer does not point out the road to a poet.Which means, I suppose, which means the poet should know where he's going.Terra mutata non mutat mores. It's appalling what's in my head.No, it means: A change of place does not change a character.You can keep those earrings.I have to keep the bangles. They were my mother's.You're done.I like it.My father always wanted sheep on this land.Oh Ruby.And your mother?Sally's right. We should both stop toiling and stand a while with our arms stretch out. I'll volunteer.For all your kindness. Coffee. And a pie.I made it.What?Sally?Perhaps, I don't know, perhaps she was busy.What about them?You sure?I cried for my Daddy. I dressed up the scarecrow in his suit and he came back, his arms out, said you never cried enough, you never cried enough.Then I thought, it's not my Daddy, it's my sweetheart. I saw him once that way, when I looked down Sally's well. So I dressed the scarecrow in the dress I wore the day he left. In case his spirit flies over looking out for me. That looks terrible.Cabbages.Such as?Dear Lord in heaven.Wait!There's someone down there. I think it's Esco.What is?You're not going to shoot him!Yes.What?I'm not Ruby's employer.So that's Stobrod Thewes.My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath-- a source of little visible delight, But necessary.We'll find out.Tomorrow.Ruby, I'm falling asleep.It's bitter, they could stop one night.It started off being over in a month.Merry Christmas. Pangle. Georgia.It's where he comes from, it's not his name.Why do you care what his name is?Orion.That's Taurus the bull, and that's Gemini and that's Orion's big dog, Canis Major.I could always name the stars, Ruby, that was never my problem.I love you darling. In case that big old sky falls on our heads. And I love you, too. Sal.Do you think he's dead?This snow. Isn't it supposed to fall with bad news?I told Georgia he can stop here, sleep in the barn. He's got nothing inside him. He'd walk out of here and die in the snow.Okay.Ruby, I'm so sorry.I don't understand.Ruby! Ruby!Let's get him home. We have herbs there and it's warm.He'll die lying here.This horse is weary. He's ready to give up the ghost.Good boy. That's warmer, isn't it.I'm getting firewood.That wood -- that sound when it burns that mean more snow?Turn round and go back where you came from.I do not know you.Inman?You'd better come with me.Ruby, this is Inman.Stobrod?He's asleep. They both are.I saw him. I realize now.In Sally Swanger's well. A tunnel of trees. The man like a black smudge in the snow, the sun behind him.Funny thing is it wasn't the same. The image. It wasn't snowing. And in the well, he was, as if he were falling.I remember it exactly. There were crows, these black crows flying towards me. I thought I was seeing him fall. Instead I was seeing him come back to me. All this while I've been packing ice around my heart. How will I make it melt?I know you have.I couldn't sleep.I can't see your face.Did you get my letters?I must have sent 100. Did you write to me?No, it's --But how did I keep you? We barely knew each other. A few moments.Your boots, one polished, one not yet polished.I'm playing a piano and you're standing outside.Every day of my waiting.Now I can't see anything.I don't think Ruby's vacating my hut so that you can sleep in a different one.Come in.Whatever comes to pass between you and me, I want Ruby to stay in Black Cove.As long as she wants. And if she never leaves I'll be glad.And you understand she's my friend, she's not a hired hand and she doesn't empty a night jar unless it's her own.This war's made some things pointless. It's hard to imagine a wedding. I think even my father would recognize that.Isn't there's some religion where you just have to say I marry you, three times, and then you're man and wife.No, I think it's I divorce you three times and then you're not married anymore.You waited enough. I certainly did. I marry you. I marry you. I marry you.I'm sorry about the way I look. In these clothes. And there are so many buttons. Will you turn your back?We can all go together.You be safe.And am I the fly in this story, or the cow?I thought you were thinking on him!I'm saying nothing.You bring that lamb outside.He came out dead, love.I'm not going to kill him. But we have to try something or else he's going to die.Isn't that a small mercy.Hot hot hot hot hot!!!Grace Inman, nobody said eat.

Do we have a maul and froe?M-a-u-l.Number three: clay crocks for preserves. Tomatoes. Beans. Jams.Clear and turn this field. No harm done letting it go fallow, now we'll do well.Number fifteenNumber sixteen: let's get a martin colony going in the Gourd House. Keep away crows. You got one thing in abundance on this farm and that's crows.There's survival. On them trees. You got a cider press or would that be wishing on a blessing?Morning.

Say some more.It's appalling what's in my head?Well that's surely true even in English.We can't keep anything.Well that's all. The rest is for trading. Else they can bury you in your finery.Good God! Okay.Takes two minutes. That's what I like.How much do you love that piano?We're careful we'll get through the winter now. I made old man Roy give me ten of those sheep on account of I said they were so small put together they were no bigger than six proper sheep.I'm sorry you had to lose your piano. I cut off my hair once, for money. My daddy got two dollars for it. Made a wig for a rich feller in Raleigh.Stobrod called himself a musician -- my daddy -- he could play six tune on a fiddle. Got himself shot dead at Petersburg. I was like his goat or some creature tethered to a post. He left me once, up the mountains. I was eight. He was gone over two weeks.I was all right! He'd walk forty miles for liquor and not forty inches for kindness.Never met her. We're the same in that regard. He said she was -- he told me a thousand stories -- she was a wolf or an indian or a donkey. Don't say much for him, except you know he'd be fast to work up a sweat on a tree if he thought there was pleasure in it.There's cows to milk.Look at us both what?We need a scarecrow, birds eating up half our winter garden.We got something for you.That's real coffee. It ain't hickory and dirt.She made it.I'm still alive.We'll be getting along.That strike you as odd?Stood at her front door?Number one -- I know that woman all my life. I never stood outside her house -- she'd invite a wolf inside if it knocked on the door.Number two -- Old Man Swanger was inside that house: I could smell his pipe burning. Number three -- look at these fields.We came by here a week ago, they were waist high in hay.Someone's been in the corncrib.It's a coon or possum. Scratched out a fist hole in the side. This place! I'm telling you -- we grow, others eat. I'll go into town, take the last of the cider and trade for a trap.What?We got some critter stealing our corn.You know it.I'm not stopping, Sally. I'm not snooping neither. Just you should know Teague and his boys are lurking down by Pigeon River, the old mill.The hat's a nice touch.You're quiet.Well now you did.I bargained like Lucifer.

Can you fire this thing?Listen up -- you got a barrel trained on your rear-end.You got a weapon?Unbelievable! Stobrod Thewes.That's my daddy...Just so's you know -- you're not eating inside. Number One -- they hang people round here for taking in deserters. Number two -- even if they gave out prizes -- you'd still eat outside.I'm what?You'd be scarred. You'd be really scarred if I hadn't wrapped them trap teeth in sacking. Which was her idea.Good God!Hey! Let's agree: you beat me, you abandoned me, you ignored me, you beat me some more -- all of that is better than Ruby with the eyes that sparkle!You were an asshole.Get him out of here!You're all set.Ain't you got a proper coat?Nobody. I'll make up food for you, you come Sundays before it's light, I'll leave it behind the Old Frazier Mill.He is so full of manure, that man, we could lay him on the dirt and grow another one just like him.It is and that's the last you'll see of him.Get on back where you came from!She ain't gonna marry Linton, is she? She said -- whatever our souls are made of his and mine are the same. You can't say that and then marry Linton.Okay.I'm not waiting until tomorrow.Little visible delight, but necessary. I like that...Don't sleep here.They stop one night, they'll want to stop two.Maybe.He said that a month ago.What kind of name's Georgia?I know that's meant to be the ugliest state under the heavens.What's that cluster of Stars?What about them shaped like a wishbone?Listen to her, Sal. She's turned into a highland girl.It's sad, Sal. It's a c-a-t-a-s-t-r- o-p-h-e.Who?Bad news is girls get working. I'm going to round up the animals. This'll settle.He can milk the cows. I was worrying about that. It'll be dark in a couple of hours. I's ten hours climb from here. He's drawn a map.You know these fools stayed the night in the Mill? That's Stobrod -- he can't do one good thing without adding the bad. Left tracks in the snow all the way up for them Home Guards to follow. That's a sign says shoot me!We should get going.Every piece of this is a man's bullshit. They call this a war a cloud over the land, but they made the weather. Then they stand in the rain and say: shit! It's raining! If I cry one tear for my Daddy I stole it off a crocodile.Maybe Teague's took him. They did that with the Swanger boys -- didn't, they? -- dragged them into town, then strung them up as warning... it's snowed since, so I can't read the story on the ground.Let's dig.He's still breathing! God damn! Daddy; Daddy -- it's Ruby. Don't you die on me again. He's still breathing!Pack a pan full of snow. I need good clean water, boiled up.He'll die first. He's got hardly no blood left in him.There's a place further on up. Used to be. Old Cherokee place. There's good water right by it.Yes, it do, country girl.Congratulations, I should send you out with a shotgun more often. He looks as he needs sleep.Be my guest. You shot or something?Hungry? He woke up.Said -- your mommy's name was Grace then closed his eyes again.I'm not surprised. Your man looks played out.Saw him when?Well there you are.You probably don't remember it right.Better get a fire going. I've got big plans for that farm. Got a vision in my mind of how that Cove needs to be.There's not a thing we can't do ourselves.Number one -- shut this door, it's freezing. Number two -- shut that door, it's freezing. I'm laying on my back, with my fingers poked in my ears trying to shut out who's got a bag of diamonds and who's got boots needs polishing, If you want to get three feet up a bull's ass listen to what sweethearts whisper to each other.In fact, if you're going to wimble all night I'm going to sleep in with him.He's right.You'd have found some other fool to rescue you.If you say a thing and then cough it's a lie. Daddy, stay on that horse, and don't lose him or sell him. We'll need him on the farm.I hope that Georgia boy's been seeing to the animals.I was not.
