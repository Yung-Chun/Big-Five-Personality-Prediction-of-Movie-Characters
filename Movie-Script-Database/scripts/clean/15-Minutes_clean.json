I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car. I go to get the cigar and BOOM! All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go. Right where I was standin'. That coulda been it. I coulda had my head blown off and for what? Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over. If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.Vodka tonic.What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk. Who knows? But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later. That's me.Not chopped up. Not chopped up like that. I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles. A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.I'm not moody.How old are your kids?Paulie, I need the cure.Will you marry me? Wanna get married? What are you doin' Saturday?I'm gonna propose.Tomorrow. At lunch.The thrill of the hunt. I love it.Not what. Who.He's from Antigua. His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party. Stabbed her with a beer bottle.Yeah. And he still went to the party.Yeah. I make big cases, they make the news and I look good. But the problem with becoming a star is downtown. They shoot at stars. Now be quiet. Shhh.I hope this prick doesn't run. My knees are killing me. Stay behind me.Keep them out of my way.Yeah, yeah. Jesus.What's your rush? Going to a party?I don't know. You always come outta your house that way?Well, sounds like burglary to me.Again? I didn't wanna do it the first time.I don't know. We got the experts here. Show them what you found - I hope you don't mind, we came over to see if we could help.Oh, sure.No, we don't mind. You mind Leon?No, what is it?A timer.We don't know that yet. It's much too early. There's a lot to be done.There are two bodies found at this point.You know you can't do that. C'mon.We don't know. When I have more I'll let you know.Okay to smoke?Watch the news?Well, just so you know. I gave you guys the credit.Nah, why should you?Good. Good. Commendable.Sure. But I would like to ask you something. You got a problem with me?You were right, they were both dead before the fire. The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine. That's usually an indicator of something personal.Pretty.Maybe you don't care about that either. Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.What would you call her?Obviously they weren't having sex. As you pointed out. So why go through all the trouble of putting 'em like that?Eastern Europe. Like what? Romania? Hungary?Yeah? Where? You sure it was a knife? Uh-huh. Really? Okay. We've got another murder - in a hotel on Eighth Avenue. A stabbing. Clerk said the room was rented by a Russian...There wasn't a fire. There'll be nothing for you to do.This isn't homicide school.You're Polish?Stay here.Where is she?Any I.D.?It's okay.After you.Check the switchboard, see what phone calls were made from this room.Any of you guys take a piss lately?Do the seat for me.Only one guys checked in?C'mere. You wanna go to homicide school? Here - make yourself useful.Our killer...our killer's standing here slashing at her. She's fightin' him. The blood is splattering this way. It's on this wall... And there's some specks over here. There's nothing here because someone was standing right here. Someone big. And he's got blood on him. Lots of blood. He wouldn't walk out of here like that. Murphy, what kind of knife you think we're talking about here?What if the tip was broken off?I think we've already found it.Call communications and get an address on that number.Good work.You got any better ideas?This has nothing to do with your fire.I'll let you know what happens.Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me. If you don't win, you don't come.Okay. I'll call it. Heads.Heads. See, you lost twice. Okay. Get in.Oh here. A souvenir.Better than one.Police. We'd like to ask you a few questions.Homicide, Miss Hearn. It's Detective Eddie Flemming. Open up.We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.Do you have any Czech girls working for you?Did you tell him you did?What are you saying?Who came by looking for her?Describe him.He had a videocamera? Where is she? Quickly!Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon. Ludwig's.You thirsty?So am I. Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.Hey! I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid. I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we? If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.You don't have to be afraid. We're here to protect you. Come with me. We want to talk to you. You speak English alright?Did he give you these? Was he just here?The other side of the street. The guy with the videocamera. Don't look - put her in the car. Stay this side.Split up!Are you hit?I know. Relax. Take it easy. Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.I can't talk right now. We have some things to take care of.I really can't give out any information right now at this point.He was hurt, but not seriously. He'll be fine.Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt. He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.Yeah. Now's not a good time.Alright?Alright.C'mon, start at the beginning. You know these people?Go on.Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out. Better if it comes from you.Arrest you for what? Why would we arrest you?What are you hiding? Why are you afraidIs that all there is?Are you here illegally? Don't worry about that. We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.Something back home?A cop?Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?She's fucked. Even if that story is true.You wanna talk to her alone?What would your girlfriend think of that?My point exactly.So am I.You're her Savior? Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start. You take her to the station house. Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.I want to talk to you about something serious.I want to live the rest of my life with you...I don't know you've been married before and I've never been married, but I do love you, and...Hey.I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!Oh, I'm sorry. Did I embarrass you, sweetheart? Oh...Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?I'm not.Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence. That was...You were merciless. You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.You're ruthless.Could be Leon's.You know, I been thinkin'...these shoes might look nice with another pair of shoes next to them in the closet.You know, Nicky, I've been married twice before. My first wife was a professional woman, didn't have time for children. My second wife...I never wanted to go home to her.Answer the phone.Answer it.That's good.Well, that's great.No. Go ahead. You're gonna be great.I'll tell you tonight. Let's do it tonight. As soon as you get back we'll talk. We'll talk.I promise. We'll talk. You'll be great. You'll be fine. Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.Tonight.Yeah. I promise.Yeah, yeah. Good thing.See you later. Good luck.Don't be late.I told him to take her there.Tommy, get her outta here.There was too much press hangin' around there. I didn't want her face on the news. So I told him to take her to a quiet area until things settled down.It was my decision, not his.Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference. How about that? The case is all yours.I'm ready to be briefed. Excuse us.Wait.Guys...give me a few minutes?Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.Just a shower?No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it. I mean, to say the least, you outta know better. You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over. You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not. Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer. Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer. That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that. You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case. And lemme give you another piece of advice. Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television. And when you get out there, they know your face. And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job. And I get more done because of it.You know, I don't know. I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.It's Flemming...anything turn up? Did they check the hospitals? Airports? Yeah, I hit him! I fuckin' hit him! We should be all over everywhere - with dogs, choppers, everything! These guys are from fuckin' Czechoslovakia...I'll call you later.Coming!Nicky!?!?Nicky?!What do you want?What's your accomplishment.Then do it, asshole.If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?

Now get outta here.Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.Maybe you can be his stand-in.Who do you think, Chief?!'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.How did you start the fire this time?Yeah? What kind?That's it! You're outta here.What's so funny. How does he know so much about me? Who tells him my life story?He's no joke! One day he's gonna graduate from trash can fires and do something big.Her lips are fuller than that. You can see 'em a mile away.Her cheek bones are prominent and her eyes were huge. Big, blue eyes and when I saw her, she looked scared. Like she was looking to get away.

I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.It's your crime scene now. You can do what you want.Nah, I musta missed it.Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.I don't even watch TV.Did you get a report from the M.E.?If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too. What about the report?The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.Hmmmm.Who says she's a suspect?Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this. I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something. Maybe she was visiting somebody here. Who knows?Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message. Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe. It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.Or Czechoslovakia. The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years. These are very intense people and they take things personally.I'll come with you.I can watch you, Eddie. Maybe I'll learn something.My parents are from Poland. I can help with the Eastern European angle.My folks are.Capra? That's not Czech or Russian.

I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.I'll call it... tails.Two heads.Do you remember the man who called?This her?I'm on my way with Eddie. Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison. The suspects might be there already.I'm on duty.Of course.I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid....Daphne?I'm a fire marshal. You remember me from the other night? You are Daphne, right?Bobby, Bobby! Where're you hit?!Lay down. Stay down, Bobby.She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.Why not?Alright. That's a justifiable homicide.Can I talk to you?Raw deal.Look - let me talk to her. Any leads I get, they're all yours. Just let me have a first crack at her.Yeah.I don't have a girlfriend.I'm serious here.C'mon. You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity. She sees me differently.You know what I'm saying here.Hey. I'm a professional.If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.They won't until this is over.Divorced.I can't take you to my place.The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.Yeah. This way.You considered becoming a prostitute?Did you ever turn tricks before?What about back home?So you were never a prostitute?I'm just trying to find out who you are.Showers are this way.I'll uh, I'll get you a towel.Shit!Are you alright?I know.They're not gonna send you right back.You can trust me.Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.I let her take a shower.No! Nothing happened.Will do, Chief.Eddie, I...Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.I took her there for a shower and that's it.Yeah, just her in the shower. Nothing happened. Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody? I mean, you shoulda heard her there. Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.Why'd you help me back there with the Chief? Why'd you stand up for me like that?Not good.Chief - mind if I take her?Yeah.The mugger.I still can't believe Eddie's gone.What's this?Is he your boyfriend?If I was your boyfriend, I might be.A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process. Eddie recommended one.I'm glad I met you.Let's get your stuff.You better get packed.Do you have coffee?I'll make some for us.No! Get back! GET BACK!!!Don't!
