{"Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens": {"POE": {"raw_line": "Well, because of you now we have a chance. The General's been after this for a long time.BB-8 ENTERS FRANTIC, BEEPS. Concerned, Poe turns to Lor San Tekka.We've got company.You have to hide.Come on, BB-8! Hurry! Poe sends BB-8 into the droid socket / co-pilot seat -- he moves to the cockpit -- the CONTROLS COME TO LIFE. As the CANOPY CLOSES, Poe shoots a quick look back: the ENEMY ARRIVESI see 'em! BB-8 BEEPS nervously as Poe GRABS HIS CONTROLS and FIRES AT THEM, using the X-wing's drop-down antipersonnel blaster! The two Troopers are BLOWN AWAY in the large BLAST HITS! Poe tries to start the ship now, but the ENGINES SPUTTER. Concerned, he opens his canopy, jumps down, moves to the back of his ship: BAD DAMAGE ON THE REAR ENGINE PANEL. They're in trouble.You take this. It's safer with you than it is with me. You get as far away from here as you can. Do you hear me? I'll come back for you! It will be alright.So who talks first? You talk first?... Apparatus. The Troopers roughly pull Poe away. A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves closer. Poe just glares as the pat down ends.All right. All right! Our Stormtrooper passes, moves fast:Not really.Might wanna rethink your technique. Kylo Ren says nothing, reaches out to him. Poe flinches in the chair as Kylo Ren reaches for his face, not touching him. Poe is soon in agony, remains in horrible silence --The Resistance will not be intimidated by you.You with the Resistance--?!I can fly anything. Why, why are you helping me?You need a pilot.We're gonna do this.I am calm.I always wanted to fly one of these things. Can ya shoot?Okay, same principal! Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles, cannons, and mag pulse -- use the site on the right to aim, triggers to fire!I can fix this.I got it!Woooahhh! This thing really moves. All right, we gotta take out as many cannons as we can or we're not gonna get very far!I'm gonna get us in position, just stay sharp!Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it? I've got us dead centered. It's a clean shot.I saw it! Hey, what's your name?FN-whaa?Well I ain't using it! FN, huh? Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn! That all right? Even in the madness, Finn can't suppress his smile.I'm Poe. Poe Dameron.Good to meet you too, Finn!One's coming towards you. My right, your left. Do you see it?Nice shot. Finn looks up suddenly in alarm --We're going back to Jakku. That's where.I got to get to my droid before the First Order does!That's right. He's a BB unit! Orange and white: one of a kind.This one is, pal.That droid's got a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker!Go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you!So are you!What happened? I got thrown from the crash, woke up at night -- no you, no ship, nothing-- BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe listens, turns to Finn.BB-8 says that you saved him.You completed my mission, Finn. That's my jacket?No, no, no. Keep it. It suits you. You're a good man, Finn.General Organa. Sorry to interrupt, this is Finn, he needs to talk toFinn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system. He worked on the base.The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report.I wish that were the case, Major. Poe hits a control. A WIREFRAME OF THE DEATH STAR APPEARS.This was the Death Star. Poe hits another control -- the Death Star SHRINKS -- AND SHRINKS AND SHRINKS, as the SURFACE AREA OF THE STARKILLERThis is Starkiller Base. This is news to many here, and they're stunned.We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got.So we disable the shields, take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun. All right. Let's go! And everyone splits.Roger, base -- red squad, blue squad, take my lead.Almost in range! Hit the target dead center, as many runs as we can get!Let's light it up!Yeah, we gotta keep hitting it! Another bombing run! Remember, when that sun is gone, that weapon will be ready to fire! But as long as there's light, we got a chance.Guys, we got a lot of company!Red Four! Red Six! Cover us!Everybody else, hit the target hard! Give it everything you got! And the X-WINGS DIVE and BLAST the OSCILLATOR --I need some help here! I need some help!All teams - I'm going in! Pull up and cover me!All teams! I got eyes on them!Our job's done here. Let's go home!Yeah, all right, buddy, hold on -- Poe runs over -- removes the ancient data device that Lor San Tekka had given him from a base computer. He inserts it back inside BB-8, who then PROJECTS HIS MAP -- which he SHRINKS DOWN TO SIZE -- and the two droids MOVE SLIGHTLY --", "clean_line": "chance general long time bb enters frantic beeps concerned poe turns lor san tekka ve got company hide come bb hurry poe sends bb droid socket pilot seat moves cockpit controls come life canopy closes poe shoots quick look enemy arrivesi em bb beeps nervously poe grabs controls fires wing drop antipersonnel blaster troopers blown away large blast hits poe tries start ship engines sputter concerned opens canopy jumps moves ship bad damage rear engine panel trouble safer far away hear ll come alright talks talk apparatus troopers roughly pull poe away stormtrooper begins brutal pat kylo ren moves closer poe glares pat ends right right stormtrooper passes moves fast wanna rethink technique kylo ren says reaches poe flinches chair kylo ren reaches face touching poe soon agony remains horrible silence resistance intimidated resistance fly helping need pilot gonna calm wanted fly things ya shoot okay principal use toggle left switch missiles cannons mag pulse use site right aim triggers fix got woooahhh thing moves right gotta cannons gonna far gonna position stay sharp ahead ahead ve got dead centered clean shot saw hey fn whaa ain fn huh finn gonna finn right madness finn suppress smile poe poe dameron good meet finn coming right left nice shot finn looks suddenly alarm going jakku got droid order right bb unit orange white kind pal droid got map leads straight luke skywalker straight ahead let dogs scare happened got thrown crash woke night ship bb beeps poe listens turns finn bb says saved completed mission finn jacket suits good man finn general organa sorry interrupt finn needs talk tofinn familiar weapon destroyed hosnian worked base scan data snap reconnaissance flight confirms finn report wish case major poe hits control wireframe death star appears death star poe hits control death star shrinks shrinks shrinks surface area starkillerthis starkiller base news stunned ll ll hit oscillator got disable shields oscillator blow big gun right let splits roger base red squad blue squad lead range hit target dead center runs let light yeah gotta hitting bombing run remember sun gone weapon ready long light got chance guys got lot company red red cover everybody hit target hard got wings dive blast oscillator need help need help teams going pull cover teams got eyes job let home yeah right buddy hold poe runs removes ancient data device lor san tekka given base inserts inside bb projects map shrinks size droids slightly"}, "KYLO REN": {"raw_line": "Look how old you've become.You know what I've come for.The map to Skywalker. We know you've found it, and now you're going to give it to the First Order. Adjacent to the village, Poe enters frame -- sees the Ren/San Tekka exchange continue.I'll show you the dark side.You're so right. And as he RIPS IT DOWN ACROSS SAN TEKKA! Poe, RUNNING, SEES THIS AND YELLS, AIMS HIS BLASTER AND FIRES AT KYLO REN! Instantly: Kylo Ren RAISES HIS HAND -- POE'S BLAST FREEZES -- THE BOLTThe old man gave it to you.Put him on board. Kylo Ren regards the Stormtroopers with the rounded up Villagers, then turns to the CHROME-SKINNED, FEMALE BLACK-Kill them all. Phasma nods, steps forward:I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board. Comfortable? Through battered lips:I'm impressed. No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map.Where is it?Where... is it? Poe can't take it -- he BEGINS TO SCREAM and we CUT TO:It's in a droid. A BB unit.I leave that to you.General Hux. Is it the Resistance pilot? Hux turns: Kylo Ren enters fast, looms large, angry.... The one from the village. FN-How capable are your soldiers, General?They're obviously skilled at committing high treason. Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army.Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid. Unharmed.I want that map. For your sake, I suggest you get it. Ren heads off. Hux hates him.The droid... stole a freighter?Anything else? Mitaka hates to say the following, but:What girl?Yes.He means nothing to me.Forgive me. I feel it again. The pull to the light. Supreme Leader senses it. Show me again, the power of the darkness, and I will let nothing stand in our way. Show me, Grandfather, and I will finish what you started. As his emotion builds, he stands and heads off -- we FOLLOW HIM, PIVOTING TO REVEAL who he was talking to: THE BURNT,The girl I've heard so much about. He walks AROUND HER, slowly, she won't let herself cry.The droid. He comes around to see her face. After a scary beat he WHIPSWhere is it?The map. You've seen it. Rey is horrified. He TOUCHES HER FACE again: the pain, tears stream. Kylo Ren, taking more from her mind... She stares at him, TERRIFIED, straining in agony -- Kylo Ren, mid-interrogation, TURNS TOWARD THE SOUND OF THE EXPLOSIONS. Stormtroopers APPROACH through the woods.Pull the division out. Forget the droid. We have what we need. A GESTURE from Kylo Ren and REY LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS, FALLSYou mean the murderers, traitors and thieves you call friends? You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea.You still want to kill me.Tell me about the droid.He's carrying a section of a navigational chart. We have the rest, recovered from archives of the Empire. We need the last piece. And somehow, you convinced the droid to show it to you. You. A scavenger -- Rey reacts -- afraid -- how does he know?You know I can take whatever I want. Trepidation flashes across Rey's eyes. Kylo Ren moves closer, his hand rising toward her. She recoils, but has nowhere to go. Kylo Ren nearly TOUCHES HER FACE... THEY'RE BOTH SURPRISE... You're so lonely... so afraid to leave... At night, desperate to sleep... you imagine an ocean. I see it -- I see the island... Tears stream down her face as she resists. She tries to break free, but can't budge.And Han Solo. You feel like he's the father you never had. He would've disappointed you.I know you've seen the map. It's in there... and now you'll give it to me. Don't be afraid. I feel it too. Where her strength comes from, she doesn't know, but:We'll see. He peers into her eyes intensely. She meets his gaze --She's strong with the Force, untrained but, stronger than she knows. And while Ren's mind no doubt goes to Luke:Supreme Leader. I can get the map from the girl. I just need your guidance.She's just beginning to test her powers. The longer it takes to find her, the more dangerous she becomes. Kylo exits.Put every hangar on lock-down. She's going to try to steal a ship to-- Suddenly, Kylo senses something. Something familiar.Han Solo...Find them. They rush past him. Kylo Ren turns slowly, and HEADS DOWN.Han Solo. I've been waiting for this day for a long time. Finn and Rey make their way into the space, opening a HATCH that allows A BEAM OF PRECIOUS SUNLIGHT to stream down like a spotlight on Han and his son. Finn and Rey get to a railing and look down. They can SEE and HEAR Han and Kylo Ren on the catwalk below.What do you think you'll see if I do? Han moves toward Kylo Ren.Your son is gone. He was weak and foolish, like his father. So I destroyed him.No. The Supreme Leader is wise. UP ABOVE, Finn, Chewie and Rey watch, rapt. Stormtroopers dot the perimeter of the structure, watching the scene. ON THE BRIDGE, Han moves closer, stern:It's too late.I'm being torn apart. I want to be free of this pain.I know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. Will you help me? Han hears his son's voice again, pained and vulnerable.Thank you. ABOVE, Finn and Rey GASP -- SCREAM --We're not done yet.It's just us now. Han Solo can't save you. After a beat, Rey moves forward with the blaster -- AIMS IT! Kylo Ren RAISES A HAND -- Rey struggles under his FORCE POWER -- she can't fire -- he strains too, especially with the WOUND Chewie inflicted. Kylo Ren GESTURES POWERFULLY -- Rey's BLASTER FLIES OUT OF HER HAND -- another GESTURE and Rey FLIES BACK and SLAMS INTO A TREE thirty feet away! She drops -- LANDS HARD in the snow. Dazed, hurt.That lightsaber. It belongs to me!You need a teacher!

The Teedo and BB-8 STOP, GO SILENT, turn to her.Parqual zatana! A half beat and the Teedo YELLS SOMETHING BACK, threatening. BB-8's head swivels to him, then back to Rey, like watching a tennis match. Rey angrily moves to them, pulling a knife from her pouch. Rey starts CUTTING BB-8 out of the netting. The Teedo freaks out, YELLING. Rey suddenly stands, turns to the Teedo and says, fiercely:Shhhh. BB-8 quiets instantly. The two watch the Teedo head off. Finally, BB-8 BEEPS a question. She KNEELS to him.That's just Teedo. Wants you for parts. He has no respect for anyone. Your antenna's bent. (considers BB-8 for the first time,Keep away from the Sinking Fields in the north, you'll drown in the sand.Don't follow me. Town is that way. No! She heads off again. Finally he BEEPS to her -- something SWEET this time. That he is alone, scared, has no one else. This makes her stop. She turns and looks at him. Not liking him. But a gesture of her head says, reluctantly, \"Come on.\" BB-8 quickly moves to her. They head off together.In the morning, you go.Don't give up. He still might show up. Whoever it is you're waiting for. Classified. I know all about waiting. BB-8 BEEPTALKS a question.For my family. They'll be back. One day. Come on. She tries to force a smile, but can't, really. She heads off. BB-8 BEEPS... then heads after her.What about him?Actually... the droid's not for sale.Who? Him? Finn is confused. Rey stands, staring at Finn, defiant. Finn can feel trouble coming -- and Rey begins CHARGING AT HIM, quarterstaff in hand. Realizing he's the target, Finn begins to RUN -- away from her, through the tent marketplace. Rey goes after him -- he turns a corner -- then another -- then BAM! She's got ahead of him and SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND WITH HER STAFF! Finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. She holds the staff on him threateningly:What's your hurry, thief?The jacket! This droid says you stole it!Where'd you get it? It belongs to his master. Finn looks at her -- then the agitated droid, Finn's mind racing. He puts it all together. Frustrated, but sighs heavily, needing to respond somehow. So he makes a hard decision: to tell the truth.So you're with the Resistance?I've never met a Resistance fighter before.BB-8 says he's on a secret mission, he has to get back to your base.Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a myth. Just then BB-8 BEEPS MADLY at something he sees.What is it? Rey moves to him, peeks around a tent corner. Now Finn moves to see: at a distance, TWO STORMTROOPERS TALKING TO UNKAR'S THUGS -- who POINT THEIR WAY! Finn urgently grabs her hand and heads for the tents:What are you doing?!Let go of me!I know how to run without you holding my hand! BB-8 stay close! This way! Now Finn and BB-8 follow Rey -- ANOTHER BLAST just missing them! They disappear through a tent. TRACK FAST WITH STORMTROOPERS, through the tent maze. They come out of a tent, HAVING MOMENTARILY LOST THEIR TARGET.They're shooting at both of us!Well, thanks for that!Stop taking my hand!Hey! As Finn comes to, he sees her. Through his fog:Yeah. Follow me. Grateful, Finn takes it. They're off. LOCALS run amok as TIE fighters DIVE BOMB. REY, Finn and BB-We might in that quad-jumper!We've got one!That one's garbage! They run for the JUMPER but the passing TIE FIGHTERS FIRE AT IT, BLOWING IT APART IN A HUGE FLAME BALL! Rey, coming to a quick stop, RIGHT UP TO CAMERA:The garbage'll do! She turns and runs back -- Finn and BB-8 follow as they all run toward the piece of junk -- and we see it for the first time: THE MILLENNIUM FALCON! TIE fighters BANK AROUND AGAIN. Finn, Rey and BB-8 run up the ramp of the semi-tarped Falcon.Gunner position's down there!No! This ship hasn't been flown in years!I can do this, I can do this-- Rey pulls the yoke:BB-8, hold on! Rey finally REACHES the switches, returns to the yoke, stabilizing the ship, afraid of this next move.What are you doing back there? Are you ever gonna fire back?!Not so easy without a co-pilot! Finn struggles with the gun controls and SWEEPING CHAIR:We're about to get some!Nice shot!Get ready!Oh no! Just as the TIE PILOT GETS A LOCK, Rey YANKS THE YOKE --You're ok. He's with the Resistance. He's going to get you home. We both will.I'm Rey. BB-8 looks at him: really? Finn is reminded: HE'S LIED TO HER. She looks at Finn with a sweet smile.Help me with this! Quick! They hurry to the grating, PULL IT UP together. BB-8 rolls over, watches.It's the motivator! Grab me a Harris wrench -- check in there! As he checks a storage box, she disappears down below, overwhelmed by the technical issues --If we wanna live, not good! BB-8 watches as Finn searches A SELECTION OF TOOLS:BB-8 said the location of the Resistance Base is \"need to know\" -- if I'm taking you there, I need to know!Pilex driver, hurry! Finn moves for the tool.So where's your base?The Ileenium system? Finn hands her the tool, surprised but thrilled -- Rey disappears below again.I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal. I need the bonding tape, hurry!I gotta get back to Jakku!No, that one! No. No. The one I'm pointing to! No. NO. NO. If we don't patch it up, the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas! Bb-8 has moved to Finn -- TIPS HIS HEAD, shows him the tool. He throws her the tape, she disappears below:Yes!None of your business, THAT'S WHY! But then: ALL THE SHIP POWER GOES OUT. BB-8 is nervous.Someone's locked onto us -- all controls are overridden. Finn quickly, awkwardly climbs up, looks out.Get off. Get off! See anything?What do we do-- there must be-- Yeah, but I fixed that --C'mon BB-8. They help BB-8 down, too: they both struggle like crazy, he weighs a TON.Oooh...You think this'll work on the Stormtroopers?I'm hurrying! Suddenly the FALCON DOOR OPENS -- AND HAN SOLO AND CHEWBACCA BOARD THE FALCON, weapons at the ready. PUSH IN ON THEM, ready for combat, operating silently, with hand signals only....I'm the pilot...No, it's true: we're the only ones on board.Niima Outpost.I stole it from Unkar Plutt. He stole it from the Irving Boys, who stole it from Ducain.This is the Millennium Falcon? You're Han Solo?No, the smuggler!This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs...!Unkar Plutt did. I thought it was a mistake too, puts too much stress onWait! No -- we need your help!This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible!What's a Rathtar?No.What about BB-8?What are you gonna do?Can you see them?They have blasters...Wait wait wait wait. If we close the blast doors in that corridor, we can trap both gangs!Resetting the fuses should do it. Rey begins RESETTING the FUSES, SPARKS shooting from them as they do. Finn quickly joins in. Rey and Finn FINISH resetting the fuses boxes. Rey smiles optimistically. Finn looks hopeful too. DOWN AN EMPTY ROW OF LARGE CONTAINERS, which OPEN -- and a GIANT RATHTAR -- an ENORMOUS, FIERCE AND RAVENOUS LAND OCTOPUS --Oh no.Huge!What do they look like?Are you sure? They scream and run off -- but Finn is GRABBED, PULLED AWAYFinn!That was lucky! ANOTHER CORRIDOR - Finn and Rey run towards the Falcon.Han! Finn and Rey race past BB-8 -- as they go up the ramp, Han says to Rey:Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too -- if we don't prime that we're not going anywhere.And you could use a co-pilot.Compressor. Han doesn't like it but she's right -- he hits the switch again and the HYPERDRIVE FIRES! The hangar is FILLED WITH LIGHTSPEED BLAST as the ATTACKING GANG MEMBERS ARE BLASTED BACK LIKE DRY LEAVES. In the cockpit the RATHTAR RIPS AWAY as THE STARS STRETCH LIKE ELASTIC and we CUT TO:I can fix that!Try transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank--I by-passed the compressor. He looks at her. A little, appreciative laugh. Han exits, walking past BB-8.The First Order wants the map.Finn is with the Resistance...Why'd he leave?The Jedi were real?I think I can handle myself.Yeah, you pull the trigger.Rey.Are you offering me a job?You're offering me a job.If you were, I'd be flattered. But I have to get home. Han looks at her, questioningly.Clean?What fight?Finn!What about BB-8? We're not done yet. We have to get him back to your base.What are you doing? Finn gets up to talk to her.You can't just go. I won't let you.Finn, what are you talking about?Don't go.What was that? I shouldn't have gone in there.I have to get back to Jakku.Luke.I'm never touching that again. I don't want any part of this. And Rey runs off, passing Maz. Rey's mind is spinning -- she can't take it -- she turns and heads off, fast. BB-8 follows her. TIGHT ON MAZ, watching her go. Maz SIGHS, feeling for the young girl.What are you doing?BB-8. No, you can't -- you have to go back, you're too important. They'll help you. Then, ANOTHER SOUND -- LOUDER NOW -- they LOOK UP AGAIN: in front of the system attack, A FLEET OF FIRST ORDER SHIPS ROAR OVERHEAD, TOWARD THE CASTLE! Rey's heart sinks: HERSafety! SHE SWITCHES OFF THE SAFETY and FIRES BACK! HITS TWO TROOPERS and retreats, calls to BB-8: BB-8 follows Rey AWAY FROM THE CASTLE, firing back at more chasing Troopers!You have to keep going, stay out of sight, I'll try to fight 'em off. I hope so, too. BB-8 BEEPS and heads off -- Rey RUNS and TAKES COVER behind a massive, mossy tree. TIGHT on her TERRIFIED FACE --Where am I?Where are the others?That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask. Kylo Ren stops, considers her... then reaches up, unlatches and REMOVES HIS MASK. Rey reacts, stunned. It takes a moment before she regains her own mask of defiance.He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator ---- Get out of my head -- But this just makes Kylo lean closer.I'm not giving you anything.... You... you're afraid... that you will never be as strong as... Darth Vader! KYLO REN SUDDENLY WITHDRAWS HIS HAND, as if her face were FIRE HOT. TAKES A STEP BACK, CONFUSED, RATTLED. Rey's body is released, she breathes deeply, her powerful eyes still on Kylo Ren, who starts to leave. And we PRELAP:You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. The Stormtrooper Guard looks at her. A beat.You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. The Stormtrooper Guard, rifle aimed, MOVES FOR HER. Rey's heart pounds -- is she about to be killed, freed, or laughed at? The tension unbearable when the Guard says:You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open.And you will drop your weapon.Yeah.Finn. What are you doing here?!... That it was your idea. Finn awkwardly smiles. It's his nature. They embrace.Thank you.I can't explain it. And you wouldn't believe it.You're a monster!The Force. Rey closes her eyes for a long beat. When Rey opens them, she is centered, fortified, and she POUNDS BACK, SINGLE HANDED SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS BACK -- She ATTACKS HARDER! Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT -- HIS BLADE GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW -- and she SLASHESFinn! Finn... Tears come to her eyes as she lifts him, holds his lifeless body in her arms. Snow flurries around them as she cries, holding this boy who she just met, who she already adores. They are left here to die -- nearby MORE TREES DROP as the planet continues to COLLAPSE. And just as it seems like all is lost... Her wet eyes look up to see:We'll see each other again.

I like that!Good to meet you, Poe!Hold on! I see it!Where are you going?No no no! We can't go back to Jakku! We need to get outta this system! NEAR-MISS LASER BLASTS as Poe pilots aggressively.What - a droid?!I don't care what color he is! No droid can be that important!We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can! We go back to Jakku, we die!Oh, you gotta be kidding me!!! I-- Suddenly BAM! THEY ARE HIT!Poe! Poe! Finn scrambles over the massive dune to the TIE FIGHTER, SMOKING AND ON FIRE, small debris around it. He thinks he sees POE'S ARM -- he pulls on it, but it's JUST POE'S JACKET. He throws that off and tries to find a way in -- even a way to LOOK INSIDE, but the smoke and heat make it impossible.Poe!!! POE! Suddenly the ship BEGINS TO SINK -- like it's being CONSUMED INTO QUICKSAND -- Finn is slipping in too --Water... water... water.. He sees a WATER TROUGH where a filthy, slobbering hippo-like creature DRINKS. Finn moves to it, uses his hands to desperately DRINK the filthy water. After a couple swallows he SPITS IT OUT, disgusted.-- Awgh, GAH! But he's parched and immediately RETURNS FOR MORE. ACROSS THE MARKETPLACE, REY kneels with an emphaticallyWhat--?! Thief? BB-8 ROLLS UP FAST, MOVES TO FINN -- a WELDING ARM TELESCOPESOW! HEY! What?!I've had a pretty messed up day, alright?! So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me -- OW!!! (BB-8 has ZAPPED himIt belonged to Poe Dameron. That was his name, right? Rey and BB-8 react, surprised and wanting more.He was captured... by the First Order! I helped him escape but our ship crashed.Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with the Resistance, yeah.Well, this is what we look like. Some of us. Others look different.Apparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker, and everyone's after it. She turns to him, concerned, curious. And asks:Come on! Suddenly LASER BLASTS RIP PAST THEM, HIT THE CLEANING UNIT, SPEWING STEAM! Rey SCREAMS -- MORE BLASTS as they run!Come on, BB-8!No, we gotta move!Yeah, they saw you with me! You're marked!I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick! Does anyone have blasters around here?!-- Are you okay? And that very question touches her -- having never in her life been asked it.We can't outrun them! Rey POINTS to a parked, four-engine SHIP ahead:We need a pilot!You?! (then, indicates oneGreat. Whoa! I can do this, I can do this--Whoa! Hey! Oh! Stay low! Stay low!Stay low! It confuses their tracking! For a crazy instant Rey LETS GO OF THE YOKE, stretches to the co-pilot controls -- THE FALCON CANTS!I'm working on it! Are the shields up? Rey strains, reaching for something in the co-pilot seat.Try sitting in this thing! Finn finally FIRES BACK at the two TIE FIGHTERS!We need cover, quick!Damn it! Rey maneuvers the ship deeper into the graveyard.Come on... come on... -- HITS AND SHATTERS the TIE FIGHTER!I'm getting pretty good at this!The cannon's stuck in forward position, I can't move it! You gotta lose 'em!Okay! For what?Whooo! The Falcon ROARS OFF, victorious, leaving the ship graveyard and disappearing into the clouds.Finn. What's yours.Rey... But before Finn can say anything they JUMP: across the lounge, STEAM BURSTS from under the grating.Whoa! What's going on? She goes below as BB-8 BEEPS concern.How bad is it?!They're hunting for us now, we gotta get outta this system! Rey re-emerges, Finn hands her the wrench.This? She catches it and goes under again, leaving Finn and BB-8 alone. He contemplates telling her the truth. This is his moment. But instead he knees to BB-8, says quietly, urgently:You gotta tell us where the base is.Go on BB-8, tell her.Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's the one -- get us there as fast as you can. A smiling Finn gives BB-8 a THUMBS UP. BB-8 quickly extends his WELDING TORCH and TURNS IT UPWARD, then retracts it.What about you?BACK TO JAK--?! Why does everyone always wanna go back to Jakku?! !This?Hey. Rey. You're a pilot -- you can fly anywhere! Why go back?! You got a family? You got a boyfriend? Cute boyfriend? The STEAM and ALARM STOP as Rey pops up, annoyed:... That can't be good.... Oh no.It's the First Order.You said poisonous gas --Can you unfix it? Rey stares at him -- and gets his plan! They head off --I got it.I'm okay. BB-8 get off me...Yeah. Their masks filter out smoke, not toxins. LIGHTS COME ON! SOUND of the SHIP RAMP LOWERING! Finn PULLS THE GRATING CLOSED as he says:Hurry!You can understand that thing?Thank you! Junkyard!Han Solo? The Rebellion General?He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker. Yup: Han stops in his tracks.You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion. You knew him. The mention of Luke has really hit Han. He turns to Finn.Wait -- a what?! Did you just say Rathtars? Hey!You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you?Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?!Good. They turn a corner:THREE?! How'd you get them on board?What about the Rathtars... where are you keeping them? A TERRIFYING BAM: a GROTESQUE RATHTAR GIANT TONGUE SLAMS into the CARGO CONTAINER window behind Finn, whose heart stops.No. They start crawling down the crawl space.A lot of 'em. We RISE THROUGH THE FLOOR to see the GANG and Han and company in the distance.Close the blast doors from here?Oh no, what?This was a mistake!They look like that. Finn yanks her away. They race around another corner -- aThis way!It had me! But the door--!Chewie, come on! I need help with this giant hairy thing! Stop moving! Chewie!Hurt him?! He almost killed me six times! Which is fine.You're welcome. Finn has accidentally hit a button on the chess set, and the PIECES appear, looking up at Finn, curiously. The pieces start to FIGHT as Finn fiddles with the controls, trying to turn it off.Do you know what happened to him?Hey, Solo -- I'm not sure what we're walking into here --Sorry. Han-- Mr. Solo. You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance. Which puts a real target on my back. Are there any conspirators here? First Order sympathizers?Solo, why are we here again?We can trust her, right?Please, we came here for your help.There is no fight against the First Order! Not one we can win. Look around. There's no chance we haven't been recognized already. I bet you the First Order is on their way right-- Finn stops, seeing Maz adjusting her goggles, scrutinizing him -- her eyes get HUGE.What's this? What are you doing? Maz adjusts the goggles again. Her eyes get impossibly BIGGER. She grunts recognition. She hoists herself on the tabletop, knocking over food and plates, crawling towards Finn.Solo, what is she doing?You don't know a thing about me. Where I'm from. What I've seen.You don't know the First Order like I do. They'll slaughter us. We all need to run. Rey is stunned. Maz, not so much. She crawls back to her chair. She points to some pirates in the corner.Come with me.I can't. Finn stands to leave. He offers the gun back to Han.I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim. Rey barges into the conversation, interrupting.Don't leave without me.I'm not who you think I am.I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero. I'm a Stormtrooper.Right into you. And you looked at me like no one ever had. I was ashamed of what I was. But I'm done with the First Order. I'm never going back. Rey, come with me.Take care of yourself. Please. Rey looks at him, crushed. With quiet resignation, Rey watches Finn return to the aliens... And all three head off. He gets to the front door and walks through it. Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a young girl in anguish, crying. She follows the sound into the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked back at her one last time.It was the Republic. Han and Chewie turn as Finn arrives, moving quickly through the crowd. With dread:The First Order, they've done it. Where's Rey?I need a weapon. Maz grabs his wrist -- holds up his hand -- THE SABER.Thanks! But TEN STORMTROOPERS come over a RISE, BLASTERS AIMED.Woohoo! YEAH! That's one helluva pilot!No, no, no, no... REY!! In crazed frustration, Finn stops running, watches the receding First Order ships, Rey their captive.He took her! Did you see that? He took her. She's gone!Poe. Poe Dameron. They move to each other -- and embrace.You're alive!What happened to you?No, no, no. It wasn't just me.Oh here.Poe -- I need your help.Thank you, ma'am -- but a friend of mine was taken prisoner--That's where my friend was taken -- I've got to get there, fast.It uses the power of the sun. As the weapon is charged, the sun is drained until it disappears. An OFFICER runs up, hands Leia a DATACARD.There is one. All eyes on Finn as he moves around the hologram to a location on the Starkiller Base -- it is ZOOMED IN: A GIANT BLACKPrecinct 47. Here.I can do it.I can disable the shields. But I have to be there, on the planet--Now you tell me?How are we getting in?We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed?! Chewie, thinking it's crazy too, says: HELL YES WE ARE!The flooding tunnels are over that ridge. We'll get in that way.Sanitation.I don't. I'm just here to get Rey.Solo, we'll figure it out! We'll use the Force!Come on! They follow Finn on the snowy hike. On the horizon, THEI have an idea about that. Han and Chewie follow Finn.Remember me?Not anymore. The name's Finn, and I'm in charge. I'm in charge now, Phasma. I'm in charge.Follow me. Finn SMILES as we CUT TO:You want me to blast that bucket off your head? Lower the shields.Do it. Chewie MOAN/TALKS. Phasma hits a few more buttons -- the controls BEEP-CLICK. \"SHIELDS DISABLE INITIATE\". Eyes onSolo, if this works, we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey.I disagree. What do we do with her?Yeah, there is...We'll use the charges to blow that blast door. I'll go in and draw fire, but I'm gonna need cover.Hell no -- I'll go in find and try to find Rey -- -- The troopers'll be on our tail. We have to be ready for that. There's an access tunnel that'll leads -- (Han starts pointing with his chin toWhat happened -- did he hurt you?We came back for you. She is speechless -- this is all she's ever wanted anyone to do. Chewie TALKS -- and Rey's eyes nearly tear up.What'd he say?How did you get away?The Falcon's this way. Finn and Rey, overcome with emotion, race through the snowy forest -- until Finn SLOWS AND STOPS. Rey stops too, both out of breath. They look at each other. They both know: they can't run.Rey! Rey! Rey... Rey... Oh no. Oh no no no... Finn turns to her, afraid and concerned. But the SOUND OF KYLO REN'S LIGHTSABER moving makes Finn TURN BACK TO KYLO REN, lit by the glowing YELLOW AND RED BLADE.Come get it. Despite his fear, Finn raises his blade in welcome. Kylo Ren CHARGES at him - Finn terrified -- Kylo Ren LUNGES but Finn DEFLECTS Ren's SPARK-SPITTING blade! Kylo Ren TURNS, ATTACKS, CUTS -- amazingly Finn BLOCKS, COUNTER-ATTACKS -- clearly IMPRESSES KYLO REN, who only enjoys this challenge more! Rey RECOVERS, gets her bearings. Her eyes focus on the two men fighting, through the trees. Kylo Ren is obviously hampered by his wound, yet he attacks with a primal SAVAGERY -- Finn BLOCKS, turning DEFENSIVE moves into OFFENSIVE ones. And he ACTUALLY GETS A HIT IN! LUKE'S SABER GRAZING KYLO REN'S ARM! Kylo MOVES BACK -- wounded, but more enraged than weakened. Kylo Ren CHARGES AGAIN -- their WEAPONS POUND, SPARKS FLY, their blades LOCK, the men are CLOSE, LIT BY the powerful, CRASHING sabers: And Kylo Ren PUSHES FINN BACK, attacks with pure ferocity -- Finn is stunned -- unprepared for this fierceness. Rey sees this -- Kylo Ren unleashes a MERCILESS SERIES OF BLOWS, pushing Finn further and further back until he loses balance.", "clean_line": "finn yeah finn like like good meet poe hold going jakku

Han gives Chewie a nod to check out the ship. Chewie heads off one way, Han in another. The grating above LIFTS OFF -- hands in surrender, they look up at Han, who's training his blaster on them, threatening. They're SCARED.Where are the others? Where's the pilot?You? Chewie MOAN-TALKS. Rey responds to him --And \"that thing\" can understand you too, so watch it. Come on outta there. They climb up -- BB-8 uses his magnetic arm to quickly pull himself out.Where'd you get this ship?Jakku?! That junkyard?Who stole it from me! Well, you tell him Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good. Han walks away, takes in the ship: it's his again. Doesn't see that Rey is awed. His back to all of them, he smiles. Chewie responds as Han heads toward the cockpit.I used to be.Twelve! Fourteen. A moment of private joy. Then he sees something that ANNOYSHey! Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line! Han moves to the corridor.My help?Yeah, I knew him. I knew Luke. Suddenly: a distant, METALLIC KA-CHUNK!Don't tell me a Rathtar's gottenI'm hauling Rathtars. On the CONTROL PANEL: IMAGES ON SCREENS FROM ALL AROUND THE SHIP. Including the EXTERIOR, where a TRANSPORT SHIP is LANDING ON THE FREIGHTER. Han is fearful.Oh great. It's the Guavian Death Gang -- they must've tracked us from Nantoon. Han heads off as:I got three of 'em going to King Prana.I used to have a bigger crew. Chewie GROAN-TALKS, concurring.Get below deck and stay there until I say so -- don't even think about taking the Falcon.He stays with me -- until I get rid of the gang, then you can have him back and be on your way.There's one.Same thing I always do: talk my way out of it.Bala-Tik. What's the problem?You know you can't trust those little freaks! How long've we known each other? Rey and Finn arrive under the gang. They WHISPER:Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap? I spent that money.I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!Tasu Leech. Good to see you. Tasu speaks an alien language, we SUBTITLE:Boys. You're both gonna get what I promised! Have I ever not delivered for you before?What was the second time?First I've heard of it. Below the grating, Finn and Rey look at each other, afraid. Above, another Kanjiklubber says :... I got a bad feeling about this... Suddenly all the LIGHTS COME ON AGAIN -- even down below, where Rey realizes it hasn't gone as planned.I got the door. Cover us! Chewie GROAN-AGREES. Chewie FIRES DOWN THE HALL as Han CROSSES THE CORRIDOR, BB-8 following nervously. As Chewie exchanges blaster fire, Han works the controls. THE HATCH OPENS -- just as CHEWIE IS HIT IN THE SHOULDER BY ENEMY FIRE! He goes down with aChewie! You okay? Han GRABS CHEWIE'S BOWCASTER, FIRES at the DOOR CONTROLS,Wow. Come on! Come on!You, close the door behind us!Hey, where are you going?I hate that guy. Han sits as, Rey hitting buttons:I got one, he's back there.Watch the thrust, we're goin' out of here at lightspeed --I never ask that question until after I've done it. A RATHTAR JUMPS ONTO THE WINDSHIELD -- REY SCREAMS! Its GIANT MOUTH CHEWING AT THE GLASS! Han works the controls:This is not how I thought this day was gonna go -- angle the shields -- Hang on back there! IN THE LOUNGE, Chewie is in pain -- Finn going through a first aid kit -- the ship is HIT again --Come on baby, don't let me down! He hits a switch -- but NOTHING.What?! But Rey reaches over, hits a switch, matter-of-factly.Electrical overload!The coolant's leaking!-- Secondary tank, I got it!You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal with me!This hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different systems. Han at the controls when all the alarms STOP. Rey, satisfied, sits in the co-pilot seat. Han is confused.What'd you do?Move, Ball.Nah, don't say that, you did great. Just rest. Han turns to Finn, who sits at the HOLOCHESS set, BB-8 beside him. This is awkward for Han, but damn, he means it:Good job, kid. And thanks.So, fugitives, huh?Let's see whatcha got.This map's not complete. It's just a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared, people have been looking for him.He was training a new generation of Jedi. One boy, an apprentice turned against him, destroyed it all. Luke felt responsible... He walked away from everything.There're a lot of rumors. Stories. The people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple.I used to wonder that myself. Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo -- magical power holding together good, evil, the dark side and the light.No, you rest. You want my help? You're getting it. Gonna see an old friend. She'll get your droid home. This is our stop. Han leaves towards the cockpit, Rey and Finn following.D'you just call me \"Solo\"?Listen big deal, you've got another problem. Women always figure out the truth. Hands him a BLASTER.Always. Han walks off. Finn watches him go, wracked with guilt.You might need this.I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you. Take it. Rey picks it up. Grips it.You know how to use one of these?There's a little bit more to it than that. You got a lot to learn. You got a name?Rey. I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew, Rey. A second mate. Someone to help out. Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me, appreciates the Falcon.I wouldn't be nice to you. It doesn't pay much.I'm thinking about it. Rey wants to say yes. But something stops her. A line she can't cross.Well?Jakku? Rey looks off, in thought. Yeah, Jakku.It's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you. Han heads off. HOLD on Rey.To get your droid on a clean ship.Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon? If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order's not far behind. Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata is our best bet.Relax, kid. She's run this watering hole for a thousand years. Maz is a bit of an acquired taste, so let me do the talking. And whatever you do, don't stare...Any of it. The door opens. Music. Madness. And...Oh boy. Hey, Maz! NOISE returns. Maz walks to them, pushes someone away.Chewie's working on the Falcon.Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia.Leia doesn't want to see me.I don't know, but it ain't good.Keep it, kid. Finn heads off. Rey gets up to follow. Maz dials her lenses back to normal, and turns to Han.Where'd you get that?Come on, Chewie! Maz turns to Finn:Hey, can I try that? Han borrows Chewbacca's bowcaster, fires on Stormtroopers and sends them flying.You okay, Big deal?It's the Resistance. One X-WING in particular -- MARKED IN BLACK -- SWOOPS DOWN and takes out the parked TIE FIGHTERS and Troopers!Quick! Chewie picks up his Bowcaster, Han takes the blaster. Shoots a Trooper.You changed your hair.No, new jacket. Chewie glad to see Leia, greets her with a hug. Chewie MOANS a few words, looks at Han then boards the ship. It is complicated and loving and painful. Han says, quietly:... I saw him. Leia, I saw our son. He was here. Leia hears this. Maz watches through the smoke.Leia...Do what? She heads off.I'm trying to be helpful!Listen to me, will you? I know every time you... every time you look at me, you're reminded of him.There was nothing we could've done. There was too much Vader in him.We both had to deal with it in our own way. I went back to the only thing I was ever good at.We lost our son, forever.If Luke couldn't reach him, how couldSo it's big.Okay, how do we blow it up? There's always a way to do that.We disable the shields.I like this guy.We'll get you there.If I told you, you wouldn't like it.Chewie, check that donal capitator. Come on. Let's go. -- Finn, be careful with those - they're explosives.That's what I did it. So you'd miss me. She laughs, moves up close to him.It wasn't all bad, was it? Huh? Some of it was...good.Some things never change.Their shields have a fractional refresh rate. Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through. Finn is suddenly filled with dread.Alright, Chewie, get ready. Chewie GROANS: he's ready. Han studies the PANEL INDICATORS.And Now! Chewie and Han hit switches --I get any higher, they'll see us! And the ship DIVES again, back into the trees!What was your job when you were based here?Sanitation? Then how do you know how to disable the shields?People are counting on us! The galaxy is counting on us--!That's not how the Force works--!Oh really, you're cold?The longer we're here, less luck we're going to have. The shields?Bring it down. Bring it down.Don't worry kid, we won't leave here without her. The controls BEEP-CLICK. \"SHIELDS DISABLED\".Is there a garbage chute? Trash compactor?You sure you're up for this?Are you all right?Good.Escape now. Hug later.They're in trouble. We can't leave. My friend here has a bag full of explosives. Let's use 'em.That girl knows her stuff.We'll set the charges at every other column. He GROAN/TALKS to Han, who looks around, reconsiders.You're right. That's a better idea. You take the top.Ben! The name ECHOES as Kylo Ren STOPS, far across the vast catwalk. He turns.Take off that mask. You don't need it.The face of my son. Kylo TAKES OFF HIS MASK. Han is JOLTED -- seeing the face of his son for the first time as a man.That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true. My son is alive. SEVERAL LEVELS BELOW them, CHEWIE comes to the rail to watch.Snoke is using you for your power. When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you -- you know it's true. Kylo hesitates. Somehow, he does know it.No it's not. Leave here with me. Come home. We miss you. For the first time, Kylo Ren seems truly conflicted. Tears flood his stoic eyes...Yes. Anything. Kylo Ren unholsters his lightsaber and SLOWLY EXTENDS IT to Han, within a foot of Han's chest. Han almost can't believe it. The moment seems to last forever.
