You wanna get outa here tonight?I'll spend fifty on ya.How ya doin', Jimmy.Naw, just a little hard times, that's all. It's all over now.Three grand on the black.I feel lucky tonight.Three grand on the black, Jimmy.Spin it again.Spin it anyway, Jimmy.Don't worry, pal. I knew it was my night.Hey wait a minute. Aw, the hell with ya.Howdy, Louise.I'll never be as good as that mark, Alva.You goin' to church now?Which way did he do, Eirie?The bastard. He can blow his nose all the way.I had some appointments.All of it.I checked the place out. There weren't no dicks in there.What's eatin' you? I've blown money before.You think my play is bad?What?What are you talkin' about? We just took off the biggest score we've ever had. We can do anything we want now.Hey look. You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'? Just cause we hit it big. Luther, I owe you everything. If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.But you played the Big Con. You said it was nothin'. A game for flakes and mama's boys.What the hell you gonna do with yourself?You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?If that's the way you want it.How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.We were partners. If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's. I don't need anything more than I got.You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.There's always a depression on.I like griftin'.I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?Hi there, Snyder. Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh? Somebody lose the dominoes?Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll.You got the wrong guy, pal. I been home with the flu all day. You can stake out my toilet if you want.You're crazy. I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.I'll square it with the fixer.My end was only one.All right.I did. That stuff I gave him was counterfeit. They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now. If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.C'mon Luther, get up. You gotta get up, Luther.Goddamn you, Luther, will you get up? I'm not waitin' for you, Luther. I'm not waitin' anymore. Get up, you son of a bitch. Goddamn you, Luther, goddamn.Excuse me, sir. Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station. Have you made any purchases here today?Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good. Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.We'll get 'em! Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know. We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh? You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it? Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge. I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people. You try to help 'em and they spit on you. I shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin' false notes.All right, I'll give ya a break. Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left. Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this... ...in the back and run it through right away. We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.Think nothin' of it.Excuse me, I'm looking for a guy named Henry Gondorff. You know him?Luther Coleman sent me.Yeh.The great Henry Gondorff.You sober?Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something. I already know how to drink.He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?You mean you blew it.He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either. You played the Big Con since then.I picked something up on the way.I don't know. Haven't seen anybody.Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?I wanna play for Lonnegan.Yeh, he croaked Luther. What else do I gotta know.Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.I'll take him anyway.'Cause I don't know enough about killin' to kill him.We'll get by without 'em.I never played for winos.You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?Then you'll do it?You sure it'll be one of these two?He's not as tough as he'd like to think.She got him clean. He hasn't missed it.He's waitin' for you in the card room.If we ever get to it.How'd ya do?My name's Carver. Mr. Shaw sent me.He cheats.Yeh, he knows that.He hired a dame to take it from ya.You were set up, Lonnegan. Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months. He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.So could Shaw.Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger. I want you to help me break him.Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar. Can't see him till morning anyway.I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit. What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place. I'll supply all the money and the information.If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.Maybe a couple million.660 Marshall Street. Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.Yeh, it was easy.What do ya mean?No, not a thing.I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.He threatened to kill me.Then he drove me home. He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch.Naw, he just sat there and listened. I don't know if he bought it or not.You think he'll show?No.I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse. All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony. There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time. We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.This is just a test. The big one comes later. Be careful with that though, it's all I got.I am after this race.I gotta get back before Shaw misses me. Good luck.Give 'em a little time.You're doin' great, Eirie. He loves ya.Well, what did I tell ya?Lucky, hell. I could do it every day.'Cause it's better to do it all at once. We're puttin' down 400 grand next week. At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.You stayin' in or not?It's foolproof. We got a partner downtown runs the central office of the Western Union. Race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies. All he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner. Then he releases the results to the bookies and we clean up on a race that's already been run. It can't miss, unless the Western Union Dicks get onto it.Not yet, but... Hey, there's only a grand here.What is this? That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much.No.Four o'clock tomorrow. Pick me up at Dewey Lyle's.Twist? I told him the tale. He wants to see ya.Tomorrow, after 4:00. Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya. And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.I thought I'd lost him.Nothin'. I told ya everything there is.It was too noisy.All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.A couple days; that's all I'm askin'. I can stay clear that long.Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.Where's June today?Where you goin'?Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th. She got me with her ring.We'll go to the side door.Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second.I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.He's right, Les.And what do we know about your guy. He says a week, but who knows if it's a month? Lonnegan here's a banker. He can get that dough with no questions asked.What happened?Oh, Jesus.How am I gonna do that?Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.What time you get off work here?You doin' anything tonight?You got a back door to this place?Look, I don't have time to fuck around. There's somebody out there I don't need to see. You got a fire escape or anything?All right, do me a favor. Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.Just do what I tell ya and everything'll be jake.He'd like to kill me.No.Don't think I know him.Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.You got nothin' on me.No.I'll make parole.Will you wait until the chump is played?I mean completely played. Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him. You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.Just as long as I get to finish the play.Just a little nervous, that's all.How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?Then why you doin' it?Henry.Yeh.I appreciate your stickin' your neck out. I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.Yeh, this time anyway.I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while. Maybe have a drink or somethin'.I don't mean nothin' by it. I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.If I expected somethin', I wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall.You know me. I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.She coulda killed me last night.Who are you?How do I know you're tellin' the truth.You were right, Henry. It's not enough...

You understand what I'm sayin'?Good lad.Where the hell is this guy?All right, let's start without him. Mr. Clemens, give me the cards.Mr. Shaw, we usually require a tie at this table. If you don't have one, we can get ya one.Lonnegan.Raise 500.See and raise five.Pass.I've had enough of your lip, Shaw.I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.I don't care. Load me a deck.

What the hell happened?You weren't hired to miss him.Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?All right, get outa here. You're outta work.We'll put Salino on it. I need somebody careful.Then why ain't he dead?Use Salino. It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.He had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house. Made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops, but didn't hit nothin'.This is Salino's job now, Vince. If Cole wants to muscle in on it, that's his business. But he's breakin' the rules and when Salino finds out about it, I can't feel sorry for what's gonna happen to him.You're a lucky man, all right.Why don't ya then.You got a system, Carver?I'm in.You got the 400 grand yet?I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more.Let me talk to him.You want your money back? Try and get it in a court of law. C'mon, don't be a sorehead. I'll make it worth your while.

You're a real horse's ass.I'm sorry about Luther. He was the best street worker I ever saw.Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal. A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric. Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.No, I lammed it around for a while while things cooled off. Philly, Denver, Baltimore, nuthin' towns.But don't kid yourself, friend, I still know how.You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?Lonnegan after you, too?You never do, kid.Fine, Billie.Great little countess, that Billie. Runs a good house up there, too. One of the few left that Luciano doesn't own.You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.You know anything about him?And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.Why?You can't do it alone, ya know. It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.This isn't like playin' winos on the street. You gotta do more than outrun the guy.You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money. And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.Right down to my socks, turkey. If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em. Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.If I can find a mob that'll risk it. But no matter what happens, I don't want you comin' back to me halfway through and sayin' it's not enough... cause it's all you got.But most of all let us know. If they got a hit on you, we gotta fold up the con. You're too exposed. You got that?Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.Fancies himself a gambler, huh?See J.J., he's slowly down already.We'll use the wire. Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.That's why he won't know it.We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here. You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?I also gotta win.By the way, any of you guys been passing off any green goods lately?Billie, if that Dick comes in again, stall him till I can get a look at him. And let me pay ya for these beers.Naw, I want ya to have this.Don't look at it till ya go to bed though or it'll turn to paper.Guy in the blue pinstripe and grey fedora.Neither are we.I hear there's a friendly poker game on this train tonight. You know anything about that?You think you could get me in that game?Yeh, I think so. I gave the kay- ducer a C-note. You find out the deck?Nice work, J.J.Fifteen grand. Looks like he's expecting a big night.Let him wait.You just worry about your end, kid.Sorry I'm late boys. I was takin' a crap.Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman.See ya and raise three.Five and call.Tough luck, Lonnihan, but that's what you get for playin' with your head up your ass. Couple more like that and we can all go to bed early, huh boys.Raise 300.Two and call.Don't worry about it, pal. Lemongan here wouldn'ta let you in the game if you weren't a chump.Just take it easy there, Larrabee.Raise 1,000.Raise 2,000.Raise 5,000.Call.Well that's all for me tonight, boys. I'm gonna leave ya some cab fare.You owe me 15 grand, pal.What! Don't give me that crap you little weenie. How do I know you ain't gonna take a powder. You come to a game like this, you bring your money.All right, buddy, I'm gonna send a boy by your room in five minutes, and you better have that jack, or it's gonna be all over Chicago that your name ain't worth a dime.Well we got some workin' money anyway.Okay, kid, you're on. But I gotta tell ya, its a hard act to follow.Everything go all right?No signs of trouble?You know, somebody tailin' ya. A torpedo or somethin'.How 'bout Lonnegan?And?Hell, they don't do that and you know you're not gettin' through to 'em.Did he hold you up on anything?That's all right. Once they start listening, they're in trouble. Just don't give him more than he asks for. If you rattle his imagination a little, he'll come up with all the right answers himself. But all he's gotta do is catch you in one lie and you're dead.Did he say he wouldn't?He'll show.Eddie, cut that out, will ya.That's what I like about these guys, J.J... They always got protection against things we'd never do to 'em.Never get enough, huh pal? I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie. He's got the name for bettin' money he don't have.That's not where we want him to sit.Don't bother to come back with a piker's bet like that again, Lonnegan. We got a $5,000 minimum here. Show this bum out.Go on, ya goddamn ninny.And tell him not to bring his garbage men in here no more. This is a class joint.He's gaffed, kid. He should start coming to you now.Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?Then why'd ya move outa your room?You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker.You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet. You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains. And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.Christ, they'll probably miss you and hit me.How ya doin'?We don't need big odds on this one, J.J. Take anything you get at 3-1 or better.He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie. How much cash we got?Get a couple extra guys in the line, then. We'll give him the shut-out.All right, Furey, your horse is Wingless. Paltrow, the Big Alabama and Phillips'll take Grand Theft. Rodgers and Eirie have Wrecking Crew. Jackson -- His Dandy, Cowan -- Change of Heart, Fiskin and Chappie -- Made to Order. Eirie, he gets a bang outa seein' you lose, so we oughta use that on 'em. If you play the birds of a feather routine we worked on, it should steam him up pretty good. You think you can handle that?O.K., you guys in line take your time, and I wanta see lotsa joy on Wrecking Crew.Don't take it so hard, pal. You probably woulda lost it.If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.What's the matter, kid? You're not sayin' much.Luther always told me to bite my toenails when I get nervous. You see yourself doin' that and you realize it ain't worth it.Take it easy, you won't lose him now. We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody. Believe me, I've seen enough to know.Two or three hundred I guess. Sometimes played two a day when I was in Shea's mob. We had it down to a business. 'Course Chicago was a right town then. The fix was in. The dicks took their end without a beef. All the Wall Street boys wanted to make investments for us. Even had marks looking us up, thinkin' they could beat the game. Yeh, kid, it really stunk. No sense in bein' a grifter if it's the same as bein' a citizen.I better do some packin'. I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cave-in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting.Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid. Revenge is for suckers.
