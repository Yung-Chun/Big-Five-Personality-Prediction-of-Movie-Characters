Friends come in all sizes!'You want your kid on the show?Then don't tell me how to run my fucking business.I'll call you if a spot opens up.I was starting to think that maybe you weren't coming.Really? You know, I used to have dinner engagements. Sometimes four, five a night. Dinner... drinks... I was the toast of the fucking town.Cars, boats, whores and horses, I had 'em all. When I walked into a restaurant, ten guys reached for my hat. When I stood up to take a piss, they cleared the rest room. I'd walk down the street and traffic stopped, mouths gaped. You know why? You know why, Frank? I was Rainbow fucking Randolph! That's why!What? You're in a hurry? You don't have time for me? The guy who earned for you? The guy who put those fucking suits on your back and the pheasant au vin in your Brooklyn mouth?You gotta fix it, Frank. You gotta get me my slot back.How can I sit around while that rhinoceros... that horned carpetbagger gets a free ride on my dime? You and I have history, Frank! Please!Don't do this to me, Frank. I'm in deep, deep shit. They kicked me out of the corporate penthouse... I got bookies breathing down my neck. I'm homeless! Don't you hear what I'm saying? I'm not gonna make it! The clock's ticking! Put yourself in my shoes, for Christ's sake!Yes! Exactly! That's what I'm trying to tell you!You'll get yours, Frank! The rhino too! Do you hear me?! The wheels are turning!Sooner or later, even a guy who's squeaky clean falls into mud.I saw you! I saw you in there... at my table... talking to him.You're my agent! Or did you forget that?Ah! They're beautiful! A perfect batch of cock cookies for a very special rhino.Oh yes, you're going to learn about shame, my dear Smoochy. And I'm your professor.Bon soir, la Smoochy. Welcome to fatty Arbuckle-land.Don't worry, little ones. Rainbow Randolph will return... After these messages!Whatever that means, you fucking retard.Give 'em a cookie... give 'em a cookie...Are you fucking blind?! It's a cock! Not a space ship! Cock! Cock!Open up, buddy! It's me, Randolph! It's been a long time!You fucking traitor! My body's barely cold and already you work for the rhino?Don't lie to me! I heard all about it! You strapped that horn on faster than a cheerleader gets the clap!You're a Krinkle Kid! Not a Smooch-bag! Say it!Say it: I am a Krinkle Kid! Say it, before God! On the soul of Jesus Christ! Say what you are!I missed you so much. Can I stay here? I got no place to go.... They kicked me out of the corporate penthouse. Big surprise. Sons-a-bitches. That's how I got this beauty.And of course, there's this...That happened after my little visit to the studio the other day. Network security. Fucking savages.I got liens, back taxes, lawyer's bills, threats against my life... I basically got the whole fucking world up my ass. It's okay, I got a loooong memory, son. What dey sow, dey gonna reap.It's the rhino, Angie. He's been sent by the devil. Sent from hell to destroy me. Smoochy... is the face of evil.You better grow eyes on the back of your fucking head, you horned piece of shit! I won't sleep until the worms are crawlin' up your foam rubber ass! I'm going on safari, motherfucker... safari!Hello, Mr. Mopes? My name is Benjamin Kunklepeck and I'm calling on behalf of 'Parents for Decency in Children's Television,' perhaps you've heard of us?Sir, we're having a banquet tomorrow and we'd be honored to have you perform for us. We would also like to present you with a plaque for your ongoing commitment to children's television. The presenter will be a young orphan with mild asthma. Can you attend?Don't be silly. The chance to have Smoochy the Rhino perform at our little soiree? I'd carry you piggy-back through a bed of hot rusty glass if I had to.I just looove your show, by the way. It's such a refreshing change of pace from that dreadful embezzler... what's his name again? Rainbow something or other?Yes. Rainbow Randolph. What a scoundrel! He's probably gay too.Yeah, yeah, yeah, but don't you take particular glee in that you basically stole his time slot? Helped shovel dirt onto his miserable corpse, as it were?Come on, he's a fucking asshole! You hate him! Admit it!Okay, they're ready for you!Well, we like to do these things no-frills. It's all about the kids.Knock 'em dead, kid!Hi there, poochy!Well, aren't you the cutest little boo-boo in the world!For you, my dear! May you live to be a hundred!Fuck!Hiya, cutie!So here's the good news: Yes, I'll be happy to end my sabbatical and return to my old slot. I know you and Frank are in a bind, so I'll start Monday. Call wardrobe, call props, tell 'em the R man is back and he's ready to start whistlin' dem happy tunes for da little chillens.Ahhh. Who do ya gotta blow to get a Scotch around here?Dammit, Nora! The rhino's gone! You need that slot filled and I'm ready to reclaim what's rightfully mine.Okay, so maybe I commandeered a stray shekel or two. Big deal! Compared to what Smoochy did that's like jerking off in the supermarket.Come on. Have you lost all affection for me? After what we once had?Why we broke up I'll never know.We could've worked through all that.Damn it, Nora! The public is clamoring for me! I'm a fucking patriot! Mopes is a Nazi! He's evil! He's probably even gay! You should've seen the way he was checking me out in the car!What does what mean?No... it's just a vibe! A Nazi homosexual vibe! It emanates from the television! The whole Smoochy costume... with the erect horn... I mean, what's that all about?I still love you! Let's go on a date!You know, now I remember why we broke up. Always with the accusations. Bitch, bitch, bitch...I'm trying to sleep, asshole! Read the fucking meter some other time!Hey, this is private property, creep! And you're trespassing!In a country like this, where your average citizen is a fuckin' Neanderthal, I wear it as a badge of honor.Listen, I barely know that broad. She's a wacko. An opportunist. I'm the most accused man since Jimmy Hoffa.That was unfair! Who threw that? That was mean and uncalled for!Bad... very bad... too much for brain... pressure building... ears ringing... eyes burning... contempt overflowing...I hate you! I fucking hate you!!! You devil-horned mind fucker! Die, die, die!!Where am I supposed to go?I'm the one who needs to be saved! Me. I'm broke! I lost my lawyer! My only friend kicked me out! I'm a fucking peanut shell in the shape of a man! Save the Rainbow! Save the Rainbow! Save the Rainbow!Attention, New Yorkers! You are about to hear a shocking story of injustice!I urge you to listen! It has a surprise ending you won't want to miss!It's the story of a venomous rhino and his aggressive campaign to slander, vilify, defame, denigrate and villainize my good name! But one thing he can't do, is take my life from me. No, friends, only I have the power to do that!This is what Smoochy has done to me! He's brought me to this! I can no longer live in a world where the innocent suffer and the wicked thrive!Where is God??!!I'm sorry to do this, people. Don't try to talk me out of it.Our guest of honor will be here any moment! This is for his eyes! For his conscience. He'll have to live with this imagine for the rest of his miserable life!This is it, folks! It's showtime! I'm sorry to do this, but he's left me no choice!Shut up, you hillbilly assholes! You're borough trash! Go back to your huts across the river!Fuck you! Fuck all you people! I was the last of the Mohicans! You'll never see another Rainbow Randolph in this lifetime! You had me and you blew it! All of you!This if for you, Smoochy! Remember this! As long as you live, remember this image! You did this to me!What does it all mean??!!I didn't do it! I know you're still mad at me, but you gotta believe me.Mastermind? I can barely figure out how to unzip my pants these days. Just taking a piss is a logistical nightmare.I was an altar boy once. Did you know that? I wanted to be a priest. Do you believe in angels, Angie?There was a little angel in pigtails. She was the only one who cared about me. She saved my life.Perhaps it's time to heal. To accept the fact that Smoochy has won and gracefully march forward. True, I'm currently wanted for a murder I didn't commit. But I have faith. Faith that justice will prevail.Did you bring lunch?Chicken and stars?Can I have some, please?Motherfucker!!!!!!!Ah! How very cozy. Like two logs in a little bonfire. All we need is a few sticks and some wienies.I had her before you! Pachyderm! I was in love with her! In love! And you snatched her away! Like a common thief! You're the bad guy! Not me! He's the bad guy, Nora. He's incapable of understanding the love we once had! Tender, yet passionate. Old-fashioned, yet experimental. Tell him about a few of our experiments, Nora! Tell him!You're just another action figure for her collection!Tell him about Jingle Jackson!The bells turned her on. Hey, tell him about Jumbo Johnny! There's a tale for ya! A whale of a tale!Shut up! Both of you! This is my show!Do you fully understand the power of a condemned man? Do you? I'm already wanted for one murder, why should I give a flaming horse's twat if I commit two more?Oh, please. Go blow yourself, Martha. Fix me a beverage, woman. Make me one of those drinks that used to make us all warm and fuzzy before bouncy-bouncy time!Remember, I have Mr. Boomy.You know, when I lived here I used to have a big painting above the fireplace. A naked chick holding a pumpkin. It was very tasteful. No bush...Oh! Goody-goody gumdrops! Vodka straight up is fine, sugar babe!Did you put on a little weight, honey? That's okay, you're still a hot little brood mare. I bet you miss the sweet sting of my riding crop. Giddy up, pony!'Rainbow Randolph is the man. Yes he, yes he, is. He's the Prez of Rainbowland. Yes he, yes he, is. With some fun, fun here, and a laugh, laugh there. Here a dance, there a song, Everything is fun, fun. Rainbow Randolph is the King, the King of Rainbowland!'Stop! It's too hot! The heat! It's driving me mad!Go ahead, kill me! Finish me off. My life's over anyway. Everything I touch turns to shit. Put me out of my misery.Would you be my friend?You too?Sorry about the brood mare stuff.Thank you.She's right, Sheldon. Don't make the same mistakes I did. Keep your dignity intact.Son-of-a-bitch!I tried.Be careful, Sheldon. Remember what I told you -- you've only scratched the surface of this scummy business. You have yet to strike oil.You're lucky to have a guy like Smoochy.He's the real thing. Smoochy's the real thing. And I've been a fraud. A wicked man doing wicked acts.Hellooo!Yes, Angelo, my little Twinkie, shouldn't you be getting ready for the big show?Buggy Double D's? The Dong Man?Sheldon's in trouble. I gotta get down to the Garden.I don't care.I have to warn the rhino.Sheldon!!!Give me that gun, you fucking wacked-out freak!I don't know.

If I ever see that Rainbow Randolph again I'll strangle him. Choke the life out of him. Squeeze his scrawny neck until his eyes pop out of his skull and bounce off the walls...Sorry, Frank.Oh my God. Have we sunk to that level already? Smoochy the Rhino? What a sap.The guy can't get arrested, Frank. He can't even break into the birthday party circuit. Last I heard he was working hospitals and nursing homes. He's a joke.I probably have ten acts in my development file -- acts I've been cultivating -- that are more deserving than Sheldon Mopes.We can do better than this guy, Frank. He brings nothing to the table.Don't ask me to do it. You know I'll do anything for you, but please... not this...Mr. Mopes?I, uh, saw your performance tonight. Very... ... spirited.Yes, that did put a damper on the evening, didn't it?Ah, no. But it's sweet of you to assume so.As stated.Believe it or not, no.I haven't the foggiest.I can see that.We all have our cross to bear.Are we going into a story?The reason I'm here today, Mr. Mopes, as fate would have it, Kidnet is currently looking for a performer with... convictions. And integrity. Someone like...... yourself.I don't think I could top that one.Yes... I believe we're ready to push ourselves to that level.I'm afraid so.Again, these are just prototypes. I've been assured by FunZone that all the bugs will be worked out before Christmas.Okay, so let's recap before we break up... Yes to the Smoochy ice pops. No to the Smoochy string cheese. And we're in a dick-measuring contest with Brown & Brown over the shampoo split.Oh, damn.Shut the door please, John.Now lock it.Thank you.I think that's a conservative estimate.Do you sense my complete lack of interest?Can I make this real easy for you?The only reason you're on TV right now is because Rainbow Randolph is a degenerate scumbag. I didn't discover you, I delivered you. Like a bag of groceries. I have a bigger emotional investment in my nail polish. So don't peddle your sap to me, rhino. Your job is just to smile and nod your head.Because it's sappy and it takes away from the 'Cookie Song.'It's cut. And I want the 'Cookie Song' lyrics changed back to the way they were originally scripted.This is network television, not a sprout farm. We're here to sell sugar and plastic. That's what keeps the lights on.Since when? Now get your spongy orange ass out there and dance for the cameras.There's no excuse for you.You seem to forget that we went out and found 'your guy.' Dug up his corpse. Handed him his own show when he couldn't sell his face to a photo booth.Listen, can I call you back? Yeah, some asshole's screaming in my ear. Thanks.If I didn't you'd still be here.I'm hoping to correct that.Great. That'll come in handy if we're ever at a square dance.No.I won't.Congratulations on your little ice show.It didn't take you long to sell out, did it?What happened to your precious integrity? Or was that just part of your dog and pony act.Nice job. Casting the show with mental patients, I like that.Excuse me for not making the distinction.May I come in?I'm getting drunk and I'm not used to it.It's just that... I want to apologize, actually. And on those rare occasions when I feel the need to apologize for something, it helps if I'm, you know... shit- faced.I... I may have been a little harsh when we spoke the other day. A little out of line.Yes, that was probably insensitive as well. I heard you're not doing the ice show. I find that... incredibly admirable. Why didn't you tell me?I'm afraid I have become a bit hardened over the years. Sincerity's an easy disguise in this business. It's hard to know who's on the level.'Rickets the Hippo'?That was my favorite show when I was a kid. Rickets was the one face I knew I could trust.Really? He was my inspiration to work in children's television.Remember it? I did it at my first communion.You're not full of shit like all the others, are you?You're for real, right?I mean, I couldn't tell... First I thought it was an act... and then I just thought you were a simp or something...I should go.It's just getting late.Better get that. Good night.We have nothing to talk about.I don't have to believe anyone. The picture in the paper said it all. No one forced you to perform at that rally.Well maybe next time you'll do a longer set.Funny, you'd think the fifty-foot swastika you were standing in front of might've given you a hint.Look, the fact of the matter is, I don't know you, okay? Not really. So don't expect me to go out on an emotional limb here.I was drunk. Don't read too much into it.You've got three seconds to pry your ass off my couch and get out.Just in case you forgot, you're a criminal and a scumbag.Where do you shop?That was a long time ago. I was young and stupid.You turned into an asshole and I didn't love you.What does that mean?You said he was checking you out in the car. What car?You're talking awfully fast, Randolph.Were you at that rally? Tell me! Did you have something to do with this?Did you set Sheldon up?Hi, Tommy. Hi, Spinner. Has Burke been in tonight?Damn it.I have to talk to him. It's about Sheldon.I'm just sorry I didn't believe you... that I got swept up in the frenzy of anti-Smoochyism.Hi.I read about the ice show.I think it's great. What you're doing for that clinic.I just need some clarification...No I mean about us.Ever since you've been back I just feel like there's something that's not connecting.I just thought we were on our way to something... granted, my mistaken belief that you had ties to Neo-Nazis might have put a damper on our relationship, but I'm sorry for --There was nothing you could have done. Don't torture yourself.'The Last Nappy Time.' It gave me a lot of comfort when my mother died. 'When doggies stop barking And fish cease to swim And Grandpa lays silent, from his head to his limbs Sadness will find you But soon you'll feel fine...'Merv Green?I knew Merv Green was a scumbag from the day he grabbed my ass at a 'Feed the Children' benefit.Can I help you with something?I don't know what you're talking about and your cologne's making me nauseous. Other than that, you're great company.It's Stokes. He's behind the whole thing! He cut some kind of deal for the Smoochy slot!He wants you out so he can put Takashi in!Jesus, Sheldon! Don't you ever pick up a copy of International Performer? He's the hottest kid show host from Asia.Listen, there was a time -- and I'm not proud of this -- but there was a time when I was a bit of a... kiddie-host groupie.That's not fair!Look, what I did before I met you is none of your business.Fix it yourself, asshole.Look, Randolph. We know it wasn't you who killed Spinner.I guess.What are you doing?You're letting them drag you down to their level.You just rest, Randolph.Sheldon!!!You're in on this, aren't you! You sold him out! You fucking snake!Sheldon!!! Get down!!!Burke's with Stokes. He's been in it all along.No, Sheldon, don't!Let him go.Now.

Sure you don't want one?So anyway, like I was saying, people always tell me, 'You gotta network, Sheldon... you gotta sell yourself... or you'll be playing the drug clinics and shopping centers the rest of your life.' And you know what I tell 'em?I tell 'em, it's not about the old handshake and back slap game. It's not about adding fuel to the shlock machine. It's about doing good work. Having integrity. Making people happy and delivering a positive message. Foundations are built with concrete, not plaster of Paris!This is concrete! This is integrity!Sorry. As you can imagine, living by your convictions can be a little stressful at times.See, I was raised by my grandfather, and Grandpop paved driveways for a living...Thing is, he didn't really pave them. Just covered them with black paint. Of course, once the first rain came along, people realized they'd been swindled. I vowed to myself back then that I'd never make a living through deception. Never. Whadda ya think of them apples?Yeah, right. Got any more jokes?Hold the phone. You're telling me that Kidnet is finally ready to do a show of Smoochy quality? Of Smoochy caliber?I knew this day would come! After all these years I finally meet someone in the business who gets what I do. Who gets what I'm all about. You get me, don't you, Nora?Well, Miss V.P. of Development... let's go make history!Okay, time out, people! If I may interject, I think we're putting the cart before the horse here...Smoochy's still earning the trust of the kids. We don't want to compromise that by asking them to buy shampoo and cheese. How 'bout we just concentrate on doing the best show possible. Huh? Without all the bells and whistles and rickata-rackita. What do you say, guys?No problem, I'll get it.Hey, Nora, wait up.Good meeting today. I thought we tackled some hot issues. Although, I'll be honest, there were a few times that I felt my voice wasn't being heard.I just want the show to have some weight, you know? Some substance. Silly songs, sure -- but with a message. Pop quiz: How many original compositions are in the Smoochy songbook?Try two thousand. Covering every topic from how yummy vegetables are to the importance of donating plasma. Don't you get it, Nora? I'm a valuable resource. Use me.Sure.... No, no, you misunderstand me. It's not that I'm literally comparing Captain Kangaroo to Jesus Christ. I'm just saying that the Captain, like Christ, was someone you could believe in. Those guys didn't care about bells and whistles and rickita-rackata. It was all about the work. Especially Jesus. Forget about it.That's okay, my good man. Three's my limit.Back in my college days I could put away a carton of the stuff.Gee, thanks. I usually don't get recognized without my horn.That's so sad. Is it just me, or is that sad?Wow, you represented Dicky Gimble?That's very amusing, but I don't care about Smoochy dolls and Smoochy floor wax... I just want more creative input. This rhino came from my womb. I bore him, I nursed him, and dammit...I should be the one who raises him!It's funny, that never crossed my mind.Excuse me, Nora. Why was the 'Please and Thank You Song' cut?Takes away? It enhances it! The cookie song is a meaningless piece of fluff without the 'Please and Thank You' coda! That's the moral anchor! That's where the lesson is! You can't sell the sizzle without the steak!I can't do that. I will not condone children consuming endless amounts of refined sugar. I have to look myself in the mirror every morning.You're treating me like a puppet. You know that? Well, guess what? I am not your puppet.We have different eyes, Nora. When I go out there I see kids. You see wallets with pigtails.What a special day with such special cookies!Rrrrrrrr! Look at me, kids! I'm flying to the moon! I'm flying to Mars! I'm flying to --Thank you all for coming. I just wanted to iron out a few wrinkles I feel we're having in the communication department. No finger-pointing. Lord knows when you start pointing fingers, someone gets poked in the eye.Anyhoo, I'd like to turn the floor over to my new agent, Mr. Burke Bennett. So... heeeeeere's Burke!Man, I love club soda.Burke, of course, is in no way comparing me to God.To be fair, Nora, I was booked to open a car wash in Montauk.I'm still in shock. Complete creative control, part ownership of the show, discretion over merchandising and a dressing room with a toilet! Am I dreaming or what?Boy, imagine... me, living in a penthouse. Who'd a thunk it.Jeez, I hope not. I have a deep respect for money. Not to mention Ben Franklin who had some remarkable achievements in his lifetime.What's this?I've never owned a gun, I've never touched a gun, and I don't believe in guns. When I played cowboys and Indians as a kid, I was always the Chinese railroad worker.Hi there.Oh... right. I saw you fight on TV once. I think it was your farewell bout.You bet. That's a big one.Well, I don't know why if there's enough room here to...I... uh... love you, too, Spinner.He seems pretty popular. It must take real talent to run a place like this.Whenever you get a chance... I just need a second.I'm sorry, you didn't have to hang up.But I am still here.Nora, I want us to start off on the right foot. I want you to know that I value your input and I don't want you to feel intimidated just because the power structure has changed a bit. I consider you a partner.Well, I was never much of the do- se-do type, but what I would love to do is take you out to lunch one day. You know, just two colleagues chewing the fat... forming a mutual respect... planting the seeds of cooperation...Fair enough. If you change your mind --Okay then, I'll be in my office if you need me. If you want to brainstorm about anything. Ideas and so forth.Ficus?Wow...Well, he's a very nice man. Very sweet disposition for someone that size.I'm sorry?Uh, that's a very sweet offer, and I love Spinner, but TV is a complicated medium and... I mean, that would be like me getting into the ring with a prizefighter. Can you imagine such a thing? Boom. K.O.! What's the alphabet, Mommy?You know what? Maybe I can find Spinner a little something to do on the show. That's probably the best solution.Look, I appreciate the visit, but I'm just putting together a little petting zoo segment. Nothing fancy -- a few kittens... maybe a duck...Jeez, this all sounds awfully elaborate. I might have to forgo the union and just borrow a few animals from a pet shop.Uh... that's nice of you, Ben, but a card would have been fine.Is this... I mean... are you offering me a bribe or something?Normally, sir, we take the trash out at the end of the day, but I think I'll make an exception in your case.Yes?Who?Hello?What are you talking about?Burke, I never agreed to do an ice show.Ice shows represent everything I'm against. They're mindless spectacles whose main purpose is to sell overpriced sugar-water and cheap plastic toys that splinter in a kid's mouth on the ride home.Until now. Smoochy doesn't sell out, Burke. You should be proud of that. Proud that you represent a client who paves driveways, not paints them over.I'll have a pineapple juice, Sandy.I'm feeling feisty tonight.Yeah, that was great, Spinner. Just watch your elbow next time. Pinky's probably gonna lose that tooth.He is not a mental patient. He's an ex-boxer and nightclub owner who happens to have the sweet innocent brian of a five-year-old!Hi.Thanks anyway, but I'm going uptown.If you're hoping for an autograph, the gun's a bit much. The whole 'catch more flies with honey' thing -- it really holds water.You raise money to build children's hospitals, right?You know, I never agreed to an ice show, nor would I ever agree to do an ice show, and let me add that none of this is your concern, sir. Sheesh.Well, I appreciate the offer, but for the gazillionth time, I'm not doing an ice show, so we have nothing to discuss. Now, if you'll just pull over, I'll get out and we'll say our toodley-dos. Far corner, please.This is unacceptable, Burke! I'm calling the authorities.I was threatened by an organization that's supposed to help children! What kind of world is this?Sure.Uh... are you okay?Oh. Well, not to make you feel worse, but with alcohol you're also consuming empty calories.Wow. I'm honored.Why don't we get some air?Well, it wasn't as bad as the week before when you called me a pasty- faced, no-talent hack.I guess I didn't want to spoil your fun. You look so content when you're berating me.Believe me, I'm learning that more and more every day. 'Sometimes light is really dark, Sometimes crows can sing like larks Sometimes Winter feels like Spring, Don't think you know everything.'You remember Rickets?That's how I felt! Rickets had real depth. He was my inspiration for Smoochy.I can't believe it. I never met anyone who even remembers Rickets. Do you remember the Klunky-Wunky dance?I'm sorry. That was a mistake, right? I didn't mean for that to hap--No, no.Yes, yes.Shhh... you don't have to explain...Why?What's wrong? Is it the whiskey? If you have to throw up, be my guest. Anywhere you like.Hello?No, but I like where you're coming from. It's an issue very close to my heart. Why just yesterday I was commenting --Thanks for picking me up, Mr. Kunklepeck. It's very nice of you.Well, it's always a pleasure to help out a worthy cause. And believe me, I've learned lately that it's not all sunshine and daffodils in the land of non- profit.Randolph.Oh, I don't know. I feel sorry for him, actually. He obviously has problems or issues that he needs to sort out.No, I would never take pleasure in someone's downfall. You know the old expression about walking a mile in another man's shoes? Well, that really holds water. Just try to imagine --Uh... can we listen to the radio?I gotta say, this is a first -- I never performed in a tractor parts warehouse before.Amen to that.It's my sincere hope that I'm dreaming right now, but in the event that I'm not... what's the deal with the swastikas?This is a mix-up! I'm innocent! I don't hate anyone!Wait! I didn't say that! I --I have to talk to you.Don't tell me you believe what they're saying!Perform? I barely sang one song.Nora, I had no idea that was a Nazi function. None whatsoever!The papers are blowing that out of proportion. It was nowhere near that big.But what about the balcony? What about the Klunky-Wunky dance?Hell of a world.I wouldn't be back here if it wasn't for you.Well, this town's a house of mirrors sometimes. It's hard to know what you're looking at.Easy, Spinner. Watch the ribs, buddy.I missed you too, champ.Sure, why not.Yes. Some very good news. After giving it a lot of thought... I've decided to do the ice show.I realize now it's a sin to waste your power.But here's the really good news: I'm doing it myself. No sponsors, no vendors, no crooks. Not one dirty hand will touch this. Not one person will make a dollar off these kids. Smoochy on Ice will be a study in purity.As far as food concessions go, I'll supply the refreshments. For free. Low sodium, whole wheat pretzels and apple slices. Healthy stuff. Now are you ready for the best part?All profits from ticket sales will be used to built a state-of-the- art methadone clinic in Coney Island.I'm not just talking a run-of-the- mill clinic... I'm going to build a methadone palace. A place where men and women can withdraw in luxury.You always told me, when you've got muscles you make the rules. Well, I'm feeling pretty strong right now.All this time I was letting the business use me. Well, I think it's time I start using the business. I've got my clout back and I'm not gonna waste it this time. Take care of it, Burke.Whatever I can do, Tommy, just say it. You know I love Spinner. And I owe you.You're too talented for the cowbell, Spinner. Cowbells are for babies.That's right. You're a fully grown man. With whiskers... and scars... the whole sha-bang. That's why you deserve a bigger role on the show. A more important role...It's fine, Spinner. We'll edit it out. But tomorrow in rehearsal we're gonna work on a new thing called 'the importance of hitting your mark.'Hi.Yeah, the papers seem to be really covering it.Thanks.Don't worry. Spinner just needs a little more rehearsal. I'll get him there.I guess I'm still readjusting a little. Like a guy who's come back from the war. Not that I'd equate my misfortune with theIt's my fault. He'd still be alive if it wasn't for me. He would have been so proud to be in the ice show.I'm sorry, Spinner. I'm so sorry.Maybe you better leave it to the police.That's okay, Tommy. I'll be fine.Didn't Rickets the Hippo have a song about death?What's that?Are you sure? The cops have tons of evidence on Randolph.Well, God help those guys now. They're gonna get a first-class ride through the criminal justice system, and I'm buying the tickets.What does that mean?Do we really need to hear this? I don't want to hear this.Okay, got it.Thank you! Specifics about his head are superfluous at this point.What are you talking about?Who's Takashi?Is this true? Please tell me it's just the confused ramblings of a diseased mind.Holy mother of Toledo. When exactly were you planning to let me know about this?!You dated Jingle Jackson?Oh good Lord in Heaven.I... uh... read once that the best way to diffuse a tense situation is with a little humor. To that end, would you like to hear a funny joke?I'm telling you, you'd love this joke. It revolves around Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny getting into a fender bender.We'll go to the police, first thing tomorrow... straighten everything out.Is this what you want? A Hansel and Gretel ending?! You want to be the big bad wolf?You're not nothing. You're bitter, misguided and I'm guessing a raging alcoholic, but you're still Rainbow Randolph. Despite everything that's happened, you once made children happy.Sure.Just making the playing field even. I'm tired of running this race with one leg.I appreciate everyone's concern, but I can take care of myself.Okay, buddy, we have to get down to the Garden. You're welcome to stay here as long as you like. Just don't leave until I get things squared away.Well, we all have our bad days.This is for Spinner.You were behind the Spinner hit, weren't you?You're right. There's just one thing...I'm not Smoochy.I finally realized we're living in a different jungle.Stay out of it, Tommy. This is my business.I don't know how I got pushed this far.Tommy, you're not going to --You know, a little grime here and there doesn't change the fact... it's still a beautiful city.No it's not.
