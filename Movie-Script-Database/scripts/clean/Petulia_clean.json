{"Petulia": {"PETULIA": {"raw_line": "You're an official host. She nods to the ribbon and cardboard which along with 'Official Host' says Dr. A. Bollen. Archie takes the ribbon off, as though to pin it on Petulia.Careful. Can you tell I'm not wearing a brassiere?Don't think about it. It will only excite you. Archie finally finds the ticket for his coat, which the attendant now tries to find. On through this Petulia continues.That's my husband over there,I've been married six months and I've never had an affair,Don't take it so bloody well. I've just turned you down. He's looking at us. My husband,Screw you, Wilma.My name is Petulia,Polo's your wife,Archie! He turns, almost at the door.Say something warm.I mean it There is something goofily desperate in her voice that stops him. He looks at her for awhile.Left.I'll come to you.And sympathy?I'll get my purse. But in turning to do so she sees David, then the spinning car, the door prize.I've been told that I'll be the one to draw the winning ticket. I'm always picked for things like that. I radiate incorruptibility. Money can't buy me. She shakes her head, thoughtfully. During all this the door- man has been busily opening and closing the door for them as they keep changing their mind.It feels so super. Suddenly, all that love.Archie, why do you play this dumb game? This crappy pretense at resisting the beautiful lady? You're bloody lucky I'm even talking to you. How many kids do you have besides fat Mike?G'night.Meet you outside.You mustn't take it personal. Lucky we don't have luggage.A little.Do you have any slides or swings for children?No, no. I was told to be suspicious of motels which cater to the family trade.You've got a very nice T,V, face.You have to use pancake make-up, things like that?,..gray . terribly distraught headlights of passing cars lighting up our room .,. Archie tugs at her, and gasps.You have 624 women in this room and I'm still counting. Archie moves behind her and begins unbuttoning the top buttons on the back of her dress.My great-grandmother is ninety-one and still has a granite chin. Archie pushes a gadget beside the bed and it begins to vibrate. Petulia sees endless Archies vibrating on endless beds.What a lecherous lotBut no fun.She stopped having fun at twenty-eight when her husband was killed in the first war, in a trench looking just like Cary Grant with a waxed moustache. She can't remember him but she does remember Cary Grant because he is from Bristol, too, and often in the news. If his picture is in the paper he gets a waxed moustache whether he likes it or not. She turns to face Archie. She is afraid and she is angry and she doesn-t know quite what to do from one moment to the next. But she knows he shouldn't be in an overcoat jiggling on a jiggling bed,Stop being so damn casual. Archie sits up but is still casual,We're about \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdtd become lovers, Did you bring an instrument, Archie?Ring for room service. Ask the robot for something splendid and musical,,A tuba. Absolutely; Bless you, Ar--hie; A tuba; Something large and twirly and pom to pom .pomX Archie, this is an event. We 0 are about to become lovers.It can't be said often enough.Are we what?No.Where do you have to rush? If we were making love you would be exploring my navel about now. Time would be the last thing on your mind. An old man in a bathrobe, sadly out of contrast with the electronic motel, looks up from the open trunk of his car. The elevator doors open. Petulia and Archie enter,You. look like a gargoyle. Poor, dumb Archie. I'm all mixed up sexually. Old Mum's a prostitute. The oldest professional lady in 0 all Bristol. Mavis, too, my sister. But I mean she's not a landmark yet.Tears, Archie.Archie, I'm going to marry you. The cab pulls away and Archie sees Petulia looking at him through the rear window. Archie allows himself the drollest of smiles.Aren't I a kook? If you think you're, 0 think how surprised the-man who owns the pawnshop is going to be when he sees all that broken glass.Wherets it all going to end if the burglar alarms won't go off? Take me to bed, Archie,I've got a broken rib, I think, I can feel it broken, Archie.Hopping around with tubas and stuff -- isntt it kooky, though? Archie has begun to remove her dress.When are we going to stop trying to undress me?Leave me alone, Archie. Archie sees she really means it,That's why. Call a proper doctor,A hairy legged old lecher running around in pajama bottoms,As a woman, not as a rib. Archie is harassed. The phone begins ringing. He grabs it angrily.You've got a super build for a man your age. Archie says nothing. He crosses to the bathroom and hastily begins dressing.Where are all the family pictures? Archie is busy brushing his teeth,Polo and the boys.What\u00c2\u00b0s her real name?And you named her Polo. That's kind of sickening, Archie. Archie stops his dressing long enough to gaze at this girl in his bed, beyond which is an overturned tuba. Archie sighs somewhat philosophically, not nearly as amused as you'd think.I'm drunk.I'm drunk.Thank you, I'll take the bus.Don't pry, Archie.I'll go home by bus.It has to be returned. \"Friends of the Evergreen,\" Archie looks blank.It's a lodge. In Chinatown. On Grant. Ask for Mr. Howard. The bus driver really leans on his horn to make everything charming.Will you remember that? \"Friends of the Evergreen.\"Mr. Howard. Tell him I'm sorry I goofed. Archie, you know something? The tuba makes you look ten years younger, and . you'know ... Thingy 0 The bus starts with a jolt and Petulia winces in pain.Hi.Uh huh.Of course.I'm fine.Ism okay.David. Somehow or other we begin to sense that madness has entered what is really a commonplace scene. Something has gone wrong and we can't for the life of us under- stand what and before we can even guess, we are:I came by to make sure there was enough milk and things. He finds the situation amusing, reaching in past Petulia to grab an orange. There should be a feeling of a possible relationship between Petulia and this man. In the next room a screen door opens and closes. Petulia closes the ice box door and we and she see Oliver and the Woman standing in the doorway.She stops. She waits for a moment, wondering if the scene she imagined on the bus is now going to occur. Will David now say, \"Just for a second there .?\"About time.All that crap about the humanitarian- ism of the medical profession. She darts alongside the building and begins frantically calling to a little old man in white duck pants and an \"aloha\" hat, May looks at Archie questioningly.Mr. Howard is the'watchman for the \"Friends of the Evergreen.\" Or was.No wonder people are becoming cynical about doctors.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 I didn't expect this of you, Archie'.(accusingly toStay out of this, Mr. Howard. She sees May watching all this with wry amusement.I'm Petulia Danner. I'm sorry about this.Take a taxi. You can at least say you're sorry, Archie.I'd like to discuss your irresponsibility. People are passing in the hallway, peering in.My rib. Archie slams the door shut ets a bottle and a couple g of glasses, pointedly, exclu ding Petulia.Archie, when you try to sound cool and \"with it,\" you're really pathetic. We're trying to have an intelligent conversation...Well, about Polo, among other things.That's dumb. Dumb. She's my business and she's this lady's business. I happen to hate Polo.I look at you and I know Polo. Explain that to him. May looks at Archie in bewilderment, she is not quite sure how to react; but when she makes up her mind it will be the exactly right reaction. Also, in all truth, Petulia is frightened by May.How many years were you married., Archie? Eight? Ten? Anyhow, the best, Wasted. Gone down the drain.Archie, we are from two different worlds. We've got nothing to agree on. Except one thing. You're a lonely screwed up mess. 0 Archie, I'm trying to save you. You're a very special man.Tell him, May. Petulia doesn't like May's amused reaction.You don't think so?It's not meant to be cute. I'm fighting for your life.I think I've discovered a cure for cancer.You look exhausted.Yes.I'm starving.Loganberry jam ... we'll have a case.You don't save anything on plastic raincoats.Ilia sorry.So do we.You're a wonderful doctor, Archie.Why are you dressed?You're not abandoning me? I mean, I wasn't all that bad, was I?Before I've brushed my teeth? Are you a communist, Archie?Tell Mike to watch that weight.Yes?I'm divorcing David, if that's what you mean,Phone me.Here.Write the Number down so you won't forget. Archie grins, sighs, and starts out. Petulia will do anything to hold him one second more.Hey,, you. Archie turns at the door.Don't have any illusions about all those groceries. I can't cook.No, as a matter of fact, I rather like it. He smiles, continues out.If somebody calls and wants medical advice on something really obscure, is it okay if I wing it on my own? He makes an amused \"you nuts\" gesture and leaves, but not before Petulia says:Phone. He is gone.Fat Mike?Say hello to \"Petulia\"s Folly.\" David says nothing.Why can't you speak English? Why the hell don't they teach them English? This little hustler picked me up in Tijuana --I've got a name for him! Oliver doesn't understand what is being said, but he is getting uneasy.What I said to this malicious little fink was that maybe one day if we went back to Tijuana --David. The San Diego bus is due at twelve fifteen. I've already bought him a ticket.Okay. He can wait inside. The cashier's a sweet old dear. I'll have him keep an eye on the ckeeky little bugger! 0 She opens the car door to take Oliver out, tense, wanting to get past this moment but fearful that she won't.I did not.Why weren't you there when I woke up? You better not say you were when the bill comes, Dr. Bollen.Avery sick girl.What happened to your hand?I love your hands. I want plaster of paris molds for bookcases. Bookends.I'm still very sick.The world's best, madame The patient turns her back on the two of them.Ask me questions.' drowsily) I had to have some place for him to stay,, David would never have let e bring him homeIrm asleep. They gave me a pill.and I' asleep,, Really0 I am really very sleepy,, Can we talk later, Archie? When ivm asleep kiss my forehead. She closes her eyes and sleeps. Archie gives her fore- head a kiss and she giggles. He leaves.Tell David, it's alright. He can come out of the cupboard. The old man almost sobs. Instead he exclaims in a jolly voice.Hi Archie. Dazedly Archie crosses to the night stand where there is a pitcher of tomato juice. Because he has nothing else to do he sniffs the tomato juice,This is Dr. Bollen of the Hospital. He's a splendid doctor, This is Agnes Lillywhite.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 I get hiccups.` I go along merrily hiccupping for hours on end.I was feeling ever so much better, Archie. Mrs. Danner looks in. She is wearing an apron and stirring a batch of something.You two haven't met. This is Dr. Bollen.He's very good about that.Right. I fell on my bottom.We've decided we're quite happy with the one we have.I'm Petulia Danner . save me like you saved Oliver ... save me from David! Don't lust scramble up the hill like a \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 b oody fool oI went back to the house because I owed it to David. I have a brown thumb when it comes to men. I put them on the Cross and call them Jesus. And there they hang. I don't know why I do it. Not because of any high opinion of myself... oh, Archie, if you only knew...Look at him. Isn't he super. A six foot three Coca Cola bottle. Empty. I did that. I'd ruin you, Archie.Feel marvelous. Michael and Stevie? Archie nods,Oh yes, fine. The cars start down their separate ways.Did you get mama on the plane all right?You didn't leave papa alone in that horrible little town?How could he have gone? Just like that?He Dromised;We didn't have to come back this early..Warm heart.All right, David.Cavalry officers, aging poets, men of science,,. They are enjoying the nonsense. Then on \"Men of Science':The first time I saw you, you were being charming to- somebody who didn't buy a boat after all, You were wearing a light blue turtleneck sweater. Your sunglasses w\u00c2\u00aere'pushed up into your hair. You had sandals, but'-no socks. Trying. to sell a forty foot yacht without socks. I had never seen anything so perfect. \"He's not real. He's one of those plastic gadgets Americans do so well. Ah, but I want one.\"They can't keep any secrets around here.A year ago. You didn't forget me,Obviously, They look at each other tenderly.Why did you let me get away?Girls like me are very rare, Archie Archie cannot endure this,You don't mean it.I hurt. Touch it Archie. Make it hurt less. His hand touches her belly very gently.0 It doesn't help.But your hands were magic with Oliver.Would you really?You'd call an ambulance? At this late stage?No. I'm different now. Damn it Archie, why did I go to that Motel with you?Is that good?Archie, call the ambulance. Archie crosses to the phone, picks up the receiver, then almost at once he puts it down again.Hey, wait I lied.I'll never forget you, Arnold.Archie .?", "clean_line": "official host nods ribbon

G'bye Wilma. G'bye Barney.A. coat. A raincoat. Sleeves. Barney has begun to snap his fingers and move his shoulders, becoming part of \"The Scene\", about which Wilma couldn't care less.buying a well larded rib roast.Wild, huh?Now you've met.Itm not surprised,Ex-wife, G' night. Petulia turns to face her husband David, who has taken a few steps toward her. She whirls around to face the departing Archie.Like what?Your hair, It gleams.Left arm or right? How do you brush it?An hour a day.You' 11 have a problem. The bursa sheath. Very sensitive, Bursitis. It'll hurt.I wouldn't be able to help much. Just aspirin.Sure.My divorce doesn't become final till nextWhat?Six.Actually, only one besides Mike.Does this trouble you?I suggested my place.No auto.Only if we make it one.She's ninety-ones eh?Not at ninety-one, hellEh?Saxophone? Electric Organ? Tuba?You said that.Are we?About to become lovers?Ah, you swinging young marrieds. He leaves.Real honest-to-God tears, Petulia?Petulia, you're a kook. He exits the elevator and whistles at a cruising cab.If he gets you there in time, you can still pick the winning ticket and make somebody happy.It's the Pepsi generation 0 He walks into the night alone.I'm up, thanks. Then his dizzy brain realizes the ringing is continuing and is constant. He sees the alarm clock, 6:1 He stumbles and staggers to the front door.Yeah... yeah 000 yeah 000 He opens the door to come face to face with the large and twirly front end of a tuba. The tuba is stark white for no particular reason.No, I've been up for hours, waiting for the doorbell to ring,Get the hell out of here . please. He reaches to help Petulia to her feet but as he touches her waist to lift her, she screams and faints,Don't you know you can puncture a lungeShut up.What do you think I am?Get your clothes off,I'm awake! I'm awake; How many times are you gonna call?I He hangs up, then realizes this was the first wake up call.Barney? Archie. Fine fine , , fine , I want you to look at a patient for me. Now. At my place. My apartment, Barney, it's very complicated and I haven't had my morning coffee yet. Her name is Petulia. I don't know her last name, Barney. Yes, Petulia. Barney, shut up. I have to get to the hospital.Prudence.I want him here every day. For therapy.Every day. Tell him that. The woman says it to Oliver in Spanish. Oliver says something obviously obscene.What'd he say?You sure? Otherwise we keep you in the hospital. You're not well, just better. Say that. The woman tells Oliver in Spanish as Archie continues examining the leg.Sorry, pal. Oliver says something in Spanish.Every day. Same time. Two o'clock, right on the dot. Sorry , , Oliver swears in Spanish and the woman clacks her tongue.Is she okay?How is she?Oh, great, terrific, you wouldn't believe it. Terrific. And her rib?Why do we have to eat topless?Barney ?Forever?It's the stuff Barney gave you.I'll drive you home.Don't be silly.How'm I prying?If I were prying, I would ask you how you broke your rib. Right?Wrong. The rib was broken hours before your fall. L' During this the bus comes to a stop. Petulia rises shakily to board it but she can't go through the entrance with the tuba.I'll keep it for you.Petulia, take a cab!Petulia, where are you going?Hi, Polo.Thanks.That's a tuba.You just had to say it.\"Predictable Polo.\" Has a certain zing. How're the kids?Okay.You need anything, Polo?We were a handsome couple. This makes her so angry she can now say what she came to say.Hello? Hello?Great. Hello?How about that?What's so great about not fighting?You told me about Warren. He sits beside her, well not really beside her, actually as far away from her as the bed will permit. She decides she will instantly get up off the bed, but she does not.If he's a bright guy, he'll make out okay.Poor Polo.Tell the kids I'll come for them 0 Sunday at eight.I appreciate it, Polo.You've got a run in your stocking. Polo exits, Archie can't figure out why in the world he even thought of making love to Polo after all this time. He sits down on the unmade bed, finds one of Polo's cookies on the sheets, and pops it into his mouth.Nobody in the world can sit on the grass and not wrinkle. She looks.No, perfect. Not even a blade of grass. Why don't I marry you, May?Tell me about Bobby Kennedy. She looks at him, smiling.Choose a subject. Ice cubes. Any damn thing. Take either side. Talk for thirty seconds against ice cubes.That dress shop of yours. \"Boutique.\" I've never seen one of those ... your rubber mannequins .. I've never once seen the pipe sticking out of their bottoms. Not once, not one damn time. That bothers me, May. May stops. She doesn1t know whether to be annoyed or amused. Shets a little of both.I'm not hostile, it's frustration. In all that perfection, how could a clumsy clot like me possibly be fitted in? I mean, without spoiling the whole effect. They have now reached the area of the stunted trees. Nuns are passing through empty benches; kids are improvising on the stage and shouting.No, she's found a fellah.What I should do is marry you. For May this has been said once too often. She is nowIt would be a fake list.Well of all people.Don't ask. Petulia and the old man are back joining Archie and May on the steps.The tuba.I tried to return it. The place was locked.I tried to return the tuba FridayAll that broken glassGoodbye, Mr. Howard. Goodbye, Petulia. Petulia crosses to Mr. Howard and presses a dollar bill into his shirt pocket.I'm sorry, Mr, Howard. Goodbye, Petulia. But Petulia just sits on the edge of a chair tapping her fingers in annoyance. Mr. Howard leaves. The door remains open for Petulia to leave. May watches Petulia in amused tolerance.What's the next move, Petulia?Goodbye, Petulia. He advances on her, somewhat threateningly.I should explain about Petuliaa She is a kook. We are going to be married.About what?Polo is none of your damned business.Needless to say she's never even met Polo.Oh, come on ..oOh, God.Who's trying to kill me?Petulia, go home and save what's his name. I really don't want to see you anymore. Archie's voice is cold. Petulia is suddenly defeated, mostly by May. She gets up and leaves.You're kidding.Well, if you're on the brink of something. How did they let you in.Do you know it's almost three? Doesn't Mr. Danner worry at all about things like that? Petulia looks at him reverently.Petulia, you've got to stop following me around like this. Petulia is absolutely silent but her eyes are devouring him with infinite tenderness which Archie is finding very touching. It is a facet of Petulia he has never seen before.Where to? I could use a steak sandwich. There's a jazz joint that stays open all night. He reaches to start the car just as she grabs at him, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 awkwardly, aggressively.No.It m not really hungry.Am I being punished?I'd rather have a new plastic raincoat.Shall I get another cart? Polo can fill three or four when she really puts her mind to it. Petulia gets the point and instantly takes her placeOkay. Wells why not do some slides anyhow? To satisfy myself, that's who. Okay. He hangs up the phone and sees Petulia looking at him.Well, we knocked off another one. Another notch in the old stethoscope.I keep a little black bow tie in my desk. In 0 case the services are in the morning and 1 have no time to go home. The neekband's all stained with sweat.Have to pick up the, kids, I'm already late.I guess soWill you be here when I get back?Where?Listen, this worries me. Really.And you hate loganberry Jam.Hi, Shut up, you guys,Mike.He's not all that fat. During this series of dumb, ordinary telephone conversa-They used to think that escape from that prison was impossible.Warren. Well, we could have gone somewhere else. I didn't know you had been.No - well, thanks, actually I haven't been before, Stevie.Who doesn't?I called you Stevie two weeks ago -e we were all calling you Stevie two weeks ago -- I was.That's what Warren said, eh?How about clams on the wharf when we get back?Oh.No, it just slipped my mind. Archie really does like his kids but his thoughts are somewhere else.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Hello there.Warren take you here?He would see the sign, eh? SeeAlright? The boys look at him uncertainly.So I noticed.Why not?You 'gust wait! Stevie is instantly excited,Bet your life'.Just leave it to meltOh.Unless you guys don't want to.Yeah.I want you to.Okay, it's a dealt Mike turns away.A nice, neat kid. After all the exuberance he feels so empty. Everywhere things are scattered about.Mrnmmmm?Forget it.Yes, Really they are all good friends, and they laugh good- naturedly,Nothing.Itm sorry.Yeah I guess so. Pity.You left the needle in. The nun would like to scream at Archie about the impropriety of his presence here but she can't. She is proud of the bottle of blood.Take the needle out.I suppose they've tried.Yes,I would put a bit more tape around the needle,How's your patient?Mrs. Danner. How's Mrs. Danner?She woke up?Let me.Mr. Mendoza? Mendoza yawns sleepily.I'm Dr. Bollen. Do you know Mrs. Danner? Petulia Danner?Petulia Danner. She gave me this address, The Mexican shakes his head in complete indifference, is already thinking about going back to sleep, and starts closing the door,She was beaten. Almost to death. Are you Mr. Mendoza?This is for you,Can I talk to you for a minute? Mendoza, with no idea what Archie is saying, starts closing the door and pocketing the money.Do either of you fellows speak Spanish? a NEGRO TEENAGER I speak a lot of Polish, if it would be any help, sir.I've got to talk with this man in here. A woman was almost beaten to death.Not here.Yes.Listen, just find a cop, huh;Who is this guy, Mendoza? Why am I always finding you in a different bed? What are you?Who beat you up?Nothing happened to my hand.Did David beat you up? Was it Mendoza? Why did you send him money?I don't care.Petulia,you're turning me into a nut. Why hasn't David been here?Petulia, is it possible for you to tell the truth about anything?There was no Mrs o Mendoza ZBring who home?Petuliag I don't understand the kind of world you live ina Come on. For Ghri.st$s sake, a pretty young gi.rl9 what the hell is going on, who would lay a hand on you, how could you get so screwed up? Through this Petulia simply lies there, just looking a Archie.I cans t stand it.Good idea. Police the area.Always make sure you've got water. You'll find some in the kitchen. What's on T.V.?Switch the fire off then. Stevie goes to switch the electric fireplace off.It's been really keen, Mom.Not \"dumb\" Archie?I'll get it. He rises quickly and moves to the refreshment counter behind the grandstand. Archie finds a telephone booth. Polo watches him at the \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 phone booth. Her eyes lose their warmth. The women's team races around the track. Archie returns with a box of Cracker Jacks.You don't even know her.She's not going to die.She has her first visitor. Mr. Danner. Polo couldn't care less. Five skaters smash into each other on the rink but Polo doesn't flinch.

And that's that.Oh?What\u00c2\u00b0s the problem?What's your name?Okay. \"San Francisco.\" 0 He pronounces it like Oliver.David doesn't answer her.What's your name? What are you called?Oliver.We've got to get this on tape. He's really something else'. I get a real kick out of him! \"San Francisco.\" Unless he's a midget. Hey, sure! Oliver is a sixty-three-year-old midgets Oliver grins, not understanding but feeling he has an ally.Get in. It's still a long drive. We'll never get home.You promised \"Oliver\" \"San Francisco.\"Like hell you didn't'. David abruptly hops over the seat and sits behind the wheel. He signals for Petulia to get in beside Oliver. Petulia hesitates.I dig, bitch, I dig! She's stunned. His hand reaches out and brutally jerks her into the car.I dig. CAMERA HOLDS on Petulia's frightened face. Now suddenly 0 the face has a tube in the nose; there's another tube in her throat; and she's unconscious.Hey, \"San Francisco\"! He pronounces it like Oliver does. He comes down the steps, three at a time. He stops before the kid.It isn't a question of hospitality, I want you to understand that. I feel terrible. Dragging you all the way up to San Francisco and then not even showing you Fisherman's Wharf. Comprehend.? Petulia goes into the living room to find the keys to the car.What's the rushy Whereas the fire! He stoops down beside the boy and shows him a wrist watch.You've go to have some little memento. Right?You see the basic problem is we just don't have the room for all the folks my old lady invites for a visit. Were kinda short of room. I'd give you the shirt off my back. I'm West-Texas and proud of it. But start loading up the house with make-believe kids, plus every Tom, Dick and Harry whose one and only claim to fame is that he knows how to do \"it\" --Hands off! The watch won't fasten to the leg either. David tries to fit it around the boy's neck. David begins to cry.I don't want any hard feelings' It was nothing personals Hey, we'll look you up sometime; When we're down that way., Have a real old-fashioned fiesta; We'll have a ball; \"Oliver?\" During the preceding speech we CUT to Petulia and Oliver, Oliver, infuriated at Petulia, defiantly shows her that he has David's watch in his fist.Dr. Worthington says she's doing fine. He's going to make daily house calls.Dad, you old fuddy-duddy, things happen. Archie suspects he is having a nightmare. With the exception of Mr. Danner, he has never seen so many cheerful people in one place.When Dad phoned me I was having dinner with a cousin of ours. Real mouth- watering Creole cooking. He and Petulia chuckle at each other as though this were some kind of private joke. Archie crosses to Petulia and just stands there looking at her. He doesn't know what to do.Hi.Sure. But what a dinky plane. Poor mamats stomach problems are far from over. He enters the cabin. Petulia sits up after a moment, looks about, sees no one else, then then in alarm peers into one of the windows that looks down into the cabin.It's not such a horrible little town. Hearts of artichokes'Papa went with her at the last minute. Petulia REACTS, shocked.Open.Where mama is concerned, papa is a very loving man. Open. Instead, Petulia jumps frightened to her feet, She seems about to leave the yacht.Please don't.Honey. It'll be okay, Cross my heart.You're still not one hundred per cent well. They've reached the cabin. He enters. She waits outside. Suddenly his hand is around her wrist, somewhat too hard, and in a gesture he hopes is playful, he pulls her down the steps into the cabin.Icy hands.So they say, Petulia says nothing. She begins undressing,Only a crazy man hits a woman. Or a coward. T won't ever again. I'd stick my hand into a garbage disposal. I would, Petulia. I'd grind it up, Petulia lies under the sheet, silent, rigid, David abruptly crosses to a cabinet and takes out a signal flare pistol. He snaps in a flare and tosses it at Petulia. She sits up in panic.Hang on to it. If I come for you let me have a flare. Between the eyes. I'll melt in ten seconds.

Is that a tuba?Make a marvelous lamp.Predictable Polo.Looking forward to the weekend. Lest I forget She opens her large handbag, takes out a cellophane bag of cookies.As usual, I baked enough for an army.This is very strange. I didntt think I'd feel like this. Mostly sad. Archie's sad, too, therefore he is more brusque than necessary. Also he is bugged by the cookies.No. Well, yes. Well, yes and no.It's such a puzzle. We really got on so marvelously. Never fought. Never screamed at each other. Not once. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Something in his silence, plus that damned unmade bed, is beginning to make her angry.Everybody we knew envied us.I think I've fallen in love. The man is Warren Smith. He's an engineer and very good with the children, but he wants to go back to school and get his masters in hydraulics. Well, say something.Were going to'be married.Not right away. He's also divorced. There's alimony ... child support It looks absolutely obscene.Adore him.Don't you have maid service?I came to tell you about Warren,Well, I'm afraid well still need all the money you pay me. And I'll be seeing him, ArchieNeedless to say there are certain problems. By now, Archie is on top of Polo, and out of habit she is adjusting her body for him.He lives in such a depressing, rented room. It gives me claustrophobia.It's such an icky little room. Archie is, perhaps, two seconds away from entering Polo, when he suddenly sits up, wondering what the hell he's been doing. He walks to the far side of the room, sticks his shirt in, wipes the sleeve of his shirt across his face. Polo feels no particular rancor, the entire thing was totally unplanned, and she has no more desire to \"make it\" with Archie than he has with her. She pulls down her skirt and adjusts her garters.They'll be ready. I thought the decent thing was to come here and talk in a civilized manner. About the change in my situation.Good night, Archie.I' don't believe it.Roller Derby starts at eight.Poor Archie.Never. The brightest. I used to have such terrible anxiety that I would die suddenly.
