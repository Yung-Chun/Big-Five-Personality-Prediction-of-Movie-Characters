{"Terminator": {"REESE": {"raw_line": "What day is it? The date...What year?Gimme a falafel with, uh, yogurt and Baco-bits.Come with me if you want to live.Hold on.Are you injured? Are you shot?Do exactly what I say. Exactly. Don't move un- less I say. Don't make a sound unless I say. Do you understand?Do you understand?I'm here to help you. Reese, Sergeant/Tech-Com, DN38416...Assigned to protect you. You've been targetted for termination.No. But you will. It's very important that you live.Not a man. A Terminator. Cyber Dynamics Model 101.Not a robot. Cyborg. Cybernetic Organism.Just a second. Keep your head down.Good cover. Alright. Listen. The Terminator's an infil- tration unit. Part man, part machine. Underneath, it's a hyperalloy combat chassis, mircoprocessor-controlled, fully armored. Very tough...But outside, it's living human tissue. Flesh, skin, hair...blood. Grown for the cyborgs.Pay attention. The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy. But these are new. They look human. Sweat, bad breath, everything. Very hard to spot. I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.No. Not yet. Not for about forty years.One possible future. Four your point of view. I don't know the tech stuff.Right.Cyborgs don't feel pain. I do. Don't...do that...again.Listen. Understand. That Terminator is out there. It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever. Until you are dead.Maybe. With these weapons... I don't know.There's so much...There was a war. A few years from now. Nuclear war. The whole thing. All this----everythingis gone. Just gone. There were survivors. Here. There. Nobody knew who started it. It was the machines.Defense network computer. New. Powerful. Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all. They say it got smart...a new order of intelli- gence. Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side. Decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination.Didn't see the war. I was born after, in the ruins. Grew up there. Starving. Hiding from the H-K's.Hunter Killers. Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.Burned in by laser scan. Some of us were kept alive... to work. Loading bodies. The disposal units ran night and day. We were that close to going out forever......but there was one man...who taught us to fight. To storm the wire of the camps. To smash those metal mother- fuckers into junk. He turned it around...he brought us back from the brink. His name is Connor. John Connor... your son, Sarah. Your unborn son.Steer!With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--That's right.Then I was assigned Recon/ Security, last two years, under John Connor.SKYNET. A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics. A modified SeriesYes....it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won. Taking out Connor then would make no difference. Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence. We captured the lab complex. Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through. They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.Can't. Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me....It's just him and me.You go naked. Something about the field generated by a living organism. Nothing dead will go.I didn't build the fucking thing.Surrounded by living tissue.Most official records were lost in the war. The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother. Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures. The Terminator was just being systematic.You've heard enough. Decide. Are you going to release me?Then why am I talking to you? Get out.Who is in authority here?You still don't get it. He'll find her. That's what he does. All he does...You can't stop him. He'll wade through you......reach down her throat, and pull her fucking heart out...Sarah?Let's get off the road.You cold?Come here.Kyle.White light. Pain. Like being ripped inside out... slowly. Like being born, maybe.I caught one, back there.It's not bad.It's okay. Forget it.See. Missed everything. Passed through the meat.What?About my height. He has your-- ...damn...he has your eyes.You trust him. He's got that strength. You'd die in a second for John.John never said much about him. He dies. Even before the war...I volunteered.It was an honor. A chance to meet the legend. Sarah Connor. Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid. When you were in hiding, before the war.I'm sure.Ow! No, it's okay. It's better tight.You'll learn.John gave me a message for you. Made me memorize it. 'Sarah\"...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you. For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will. You must be stronger than you imagine you can be. You must survive, or I will never exist.' That's all.Good field-dressing.Sleep. It'll be light soon.About what?Alright. You stay down by day, but at night you can move around. The H-K's use infra-red so you still have to watch out. But they're not too bright. John taught us ways to dust them them. That's when the infiltra- tors started to appear. The Terminators were the newest, the worst...We used them to spot Terminators.Rad tubes?Bag some Z's?Yours is over there.Aren't you afraid to be out in the open like this?What's that?Why?What about it?Molecular-memory.That's the way it was told to me.Tactically dangerous. We lay low.That's not my mission.Let's go. Time to move out.Sarah!I'm wrong here. I wasn't meant to see this...It's...like some dream. This...this......and you...all so...beauti- ful. It hurts, Sarah. More than death.Don't you understand...it's all gone!Is this enough?Later. I'm going out for materiel. Keep this.Plastique.Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable. I learned howto make it when I was a kid.Make sure there's none on the threads, like this. Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.That's good. Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.Hot dogs?My whole life has been combat.Not possible.We'll head out at 0200. That gives you four hours to sleep if you want. I'll finish.Probably. Sarah, if I get zeroed...If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything. In case they send another one.No. I'm not.Good fighters.Someone?No. Never.Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.It's better that way.John Connor gave me a picture of you once. I never knew why. It was very old. Torn. Faded. You were young, like you are now. You weren't smiling...just a little sad... I always wondered what you were thinking at that second.I memorized every line, every curve...Sarah, I came across time for you. I love you. I always have.I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said...Ticklish?What are you doing?I don't think I like this.Listen to the dogs.Light it now.Switch places with me.Sarah.Cover...our footsteps...Leave me here.Run!Run, damn it!", "clean_line": "day date year gimme falafel uh yogurt baco bits come want live hold injured shot exactly exactly sound understand understand help reese sergeant tech com dn assigned protect ve targetted termination important live man terminator cyber dynamics model robot cyborg cybernetic organism second head good cover alright listen terminator infil tration unit man machine underneath hyperalloy combat chassis mircoprocessor controlled fully armored tough outside living human tissue flesh skin hair blood grown cyborgs pay attention series rubber skin spotted easy new look human sweat bad breath hard spot wait til moved zero years possible future point view know tech stuff right cyborgs feel pain listen understand terminator reasoned bargained feel pity remorse fear absolutely stop dead maybe weapons know war years nuclear war thing everythingis gone gone survivors knew started machines defense network new powerful hooked trusted run got smart new order intelli gence saw people threat ones decided fate microsecond extermination war born ruins grew starving hiding hunter killers patrol machines build automated factories rounded camps orderly disposal burned laser scan kept alive work loading bodies disposal units ran night day close going forever man taught fight storm wire camps smash metal mother fuckers junk turned brought brink connor john connor son sarah unborn son steer thirty second perry right assigned recon security years john connor skynet defense built sac norad cyber dynamics modified seriesyes choice defensive grid smashed taken mainframes won taking connor difference skynet wipe entire exist ence captured lab complex called time displacement equipment terminator gone sent intercept zeroed place sumner goes home comes naked field generated living organism dead build fucking thing surrounded living tissue official records lost war knew connor mother lived city scanner pictures terminator systematic ve heard decide going release talking authority ll stop ll wade reach throat pull fucking heart sarah let road cold come kyle white light pain like ripped inside slowly like born maybe caught bad okay forget missed passed meat height damn eyes trust got strength die second john john said dies war volunteered honor chance meet legend sarah connor taught son fight organize prepare kid hiding war sure ow okay better tight ll learn john gave message memorize sarah message sarah thank courage dark years help soon face tell future set thing fate stronger imagine survive exist good field dressing sleep ll light soon alright stay day night use infra red watch bright john taught ways dust infiltra tors started appear terminators newest worst spot terminators rad tubes bag aren afraid open like molecular memory way told tactically dangerous lay low mission let time sarah wrong wasn meant like dream beauti ful hurts sarah death understand gone later going materiel plastique nitroglycerin basically bit stable learned howto kid sure threads like screw end cap gently good seven like fuses hot dogs life combat possible ll head gives hours sleep want ll finish probably sarah zeroed away disappear trace different country different case send good fighters pain controlled disconnect better way john connor gave picture knew old torn faded young like weren smiling little sad wondered thinking second memorized line curve sarah came time love sorry shouldn said ticklish think like listen dogs light switch places sarah cover footsteps leave run run damn"}, "SARAH": {"raw_line": "Watch this for me, big buns.Yes, Chuck?Mission control to Chuck, come in...Aren't I worth waiting for?I don't know.

Right?Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard. Eighty-six it. We'll blow up the place...burn it down. Something.Reese. Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again. We have to so it ourselves.Listen. Understand. I'm not a military objective, Reese. I'm a person... You don't own me.Fuck you! Let go of me!Let...go...bastard...Oh, that's real smart. Go on, shoot me. That's brilliant.Jesus Christ, Reese.

Moth balls... Mmm. What's for dinner?What's that?You must have had a fun child- hood.I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done. You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.I want it to be over for you.I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now. Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.He'll find us, won't he?Don't say that.It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh? You must be pretty disappointed.Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?A girl.

Listen to me!Move! Reese! Let's go. Move you ass!Come on!You're...terminated...fucker!...and the hardest thing is deciding what I should tell you and what not to. Well, anyway, I've got a while yet before you're old enough to understand the tapes. They're more for me at this point... to help get it all straight.Should I tell you about your father? That's a tough one. Will it change your decision to send him here...knowing? But if you don't send Kyle, you could never be. God, you can go crazy thinking about all this...I suppose I'll tell you...I owe him that. And maybe it'll be enough if you know that in the few hours we had together we loved a lifetime's worth...That's a pretty good hustle, kid. Four.
