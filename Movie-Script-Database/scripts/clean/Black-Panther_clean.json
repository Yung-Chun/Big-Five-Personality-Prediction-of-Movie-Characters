T'Challa closes the model and steps to a marked circle in the floor.What are you talking about? I never freeze.Nakia . . . I . . . I wanted to ...My father is dead , Nakia. The news devastates her .This never gets old .So surprised my little sister came to see me off before our big day .Update? No, it worked perfectly .I cannot wait to see what kind of update you make to your ceremonial outfit. Shuri flips him off .How are you feeling today, mama?I AM PRINCE T'CHALLA SO OF KingYield! Don't make me kill you .What would the proud Jabari do without you? T'Challa tightens further.You have fought with honor , now yield! Your people need you . M'Baku looks up at the Jabari warriors .Yield, man ! M' Baku grudgingly reaches out and TAPS. T'Cha l la lets him go and is barely ab l e to stand h i mself as Zuri steps forward . The crowd ERUPTS as struggling to catch his breath , T'Challa proud l y lifts his ar m.Zuri .Wakanda forever !! The arena ECHOES THE PHRASE emphatically .Baba!I am sorry .That is not what I am talking about . I am not ready to be without you.Never .He was there ! He was there . My father.Corne home , Nakia .Stay.What would you have Wakanda do about it? Nakia thinks for a bit .If you were not so stubborn you would make such a great queen.Is that him? Glory to Bast, man, is he still growing?Nakia thinks we should be doing more .Foreign aid ... refugee programs. W'Kabi shakes his head.But waging war on other countries has never been our way . Then , both of their Kimoyo beads buzz.Klaue has escaped our pursuits for almost 30 years. Not capturing him was perhaps my father's greatest regret . I wish to bring Klaue back here to stand trial .I need you here protecting the border.You have my word I will bring him back.Stop it. Stop it. Shuri laughs and they do a special handshake before walking down the spiral walkway into her sprawling, futuristic lab.Okoye. And Nakia as well. Shuri makes a face at Nakia .Yes . We'll be fine .And what are these?What , you don't like my royal sandals? I wanted to go old school for my first day .Interesting .Old ... ?Enough .. .Tempting . But the idea is to not be noticed . This one . Shuri uses her Kimoyo beads to sync the suit to T'Challa.Anywhere?You told me to strike it, you didn't say how hard . Shuri picks the mannequin back up and drags it over to the same spot .Well maybe you should make it a little stronger , eh? Shuri shrugs as we see Wakandan Script built into the suit GLOWING INDIGO where the impact of T'Challa's foot landed. T'Challa looks closely at the glowing script .Wait a minute .Very nice.You are recording?Delete that footage ...The woman outside -- what trouble was she referring to? She plays along, alluring .Agent Ross .You are buying from Klaue ...I gave you Zemo.I am not here to make a deal . Ross rolls his eyes .And the vibranium.Stand down . We can't afford a shoot- out.Shuri !Keep go in g ! Panther uses his claws to make a sharp turn and avoid the wreck .Don't worry about it . You're doing great . Panther leaps back onto the hood of the Lexus and they speed off . I/e . KLAUE'S 4RUNNER SPEAR STREET - NIGHTPull around the truck .Faster , Shuri .Did you think we would forget !? Klaue laughs .Look at me murderer ! Where did you get this weapon?After your questioning , we will to take him back to Wakanda with us . Ross stares at T'Challa for a beat .--Agent Ross .I do appreciate your help in Busan .Okoye! Play nice.And you believe the word of an arms dealer , strapped to a chair. Ross hesitates , but doesn ' t bite .Give me a Kimoyo bead . T'Challa looks at Nakia and motions towards her Kimoyo bead. She pulls one off and hands it to him . T'Challa inserts it into Ross' wound.This will stabilize him for now .Give him to us . We can save him.I am well aware of my duties, General. I cannot just let him die knowing we can save him.He's not here . T'Challa's eyes lower regretfully .He slipped through our hands .What happened to my Uncle N'Jobu? My father told me he disappeared ... there was a man today wearing a ring identical to this one . Zuri turns back and T'Challa lifts his hand, showing his VIBRANIUMRING from CA: CW . zuri turns away uncomfortable.That is not your choice to make. What happened to him?I am your King now! Zuri looks up.No . .No no no no no no . . .And the child ...He didn ' t even give him a proper burial ... My Uncle N'Jobu betrayed us , but my father may have created something even worse .Did he reveal anything about his identity?I don't care that you brought Klaue, the only reason I don't kill you where you stand is because I know who you are ... now what do you want?And what tools are those?Our our weapons will not be used to wage war on the world . It is not our way to be judge jury and executioner for people who are not our own .I am not King of all people. I am King of Wakanda. And it is my responsibility to make sure our people are safe and that vibranium does not fall into the hands of a person like you. The elders murmur at Killmonger's disrespect. They wait to see how T'Challa will respond . Then , Ramonda suddenly speaks .No.Take him away.I accept your challenge. W'Kabi looks at T'Challa closely .This is your last chance, thro w down your weapons and we can handle this another way.Zuri , no .Nol Zuri no! Zuri!! Noo! Fueled by rage, T'Challa lifts back up to his feet. He charges Killmonger , who ducks his attacks, while talking to the audience .Why, Baba?You were wrong to abandon him .You were wrong ! All of you were wrong ! To turn your backs on the rest of the world . We let the fear of our discovery stop us from doing what is right . No more! I cannot stay here with you. I cannot rest while he sits on the throne . He is a monster of our own making . I must take the mantle back , I must. I must right these wrongs . T'Chaka looks at his son , his disappointment giving way to a proud smile .Do you have a blanket? They embrace. T'Challa turns to see Nakia and Shuri as well. The four of them embrace as M'Baku looks on .Our resources . The Great Mound.The challenge will have to continue .Could you give me and Lord M' Baku a moment? Everyone exits and M'Baku gazes at T'Challa .Thank you.Please allow my mother to stay here .You know I could use an army as well.It is our cause . It is for all of us .I cannot speak for past Kings . But an enemy sits on the throne right now. We both know the power of vibraniurn . If Killmonger gets control of it, who do you think he will come for next? M'Baku sits .N'Jadakalll !I never yielded, and as you can see, I am not dead .W'Kabi stop this ! Stop this now ! W Kabi runs on top of a large ' rock to ga i n a vantage point , and pulls out a large HORN .Shuri I! The DOG PILE is LAU NCHED off through the air !Shuri !Turn on the train on the bottom track!Neither will he.You want to see us become just like the people you hate so much? Divide and conquer the land as they did?You have become them . You will destroy the world, Wakanda included .Maybe we can still heal you . Killmonger thinks on this .Thank you. You saved me. You saved my family . Our nation.You can't blame me I almost died . Nakia looks at him deeply, and kisses him back.Stay . I think I know a way you can still fulfill your calling. Please stay. Nakia looks at T' Challa with curious eyes. She kisses him .This is where our father killed our uncle. Shuri looks at T'Challa, shocked by his bluntness. She turns and stares closely at the building. We see her POV of large SIGNAGE that hints that the building is soon to be demolished .They're not tearing it down . . . I bought this building. Shuri turns to him confused .Nakia will oversee the social outreach ... And you will spearhead the science and information exchange . Shuri turns to T'Challa in shock at what this means.My name is King T'Challa , son of King T'Chaka . I am the sovereign ruler of the Nation of Wakanda and for the first time in our history we will be sharing our knowledge and resources with the outside world. Wakanda will no longer watch from the shadows . We cannot , we must not. We will work to be an example of how we as brothers and sisters on this Earth should treat each other . Now more than ever , illusions of division threaten our very e x istence. We all know the truth : more connects us than separates us . In times of crisis , the wise build bridges , while the foolish build barriers . We must find a way to look after one another, as if we were one single tribe .

Don't trip, I'mma take it off your hands for you. She looks at Killmonger like he's crazy .How do you think your ancestors got these? You think they paid a fair price? Or did they take it like they took everything else .You got all this security watching me ever since I walked in. But , you ain't checking for what you put in your body . The museum director looks at Killmonger in terror as a security guard walks up behind him .I think she might not be feelin' too good .Hey! Hey somebody get some help ! Come here! Call a doctor, please! Hey please, somebody come help ! The security guards quickly rush to the museum director's aid .Bro, why you 'aint just shoot h im right here?Whatever you try , the Wakandans ' ll probably show up .Nah , I'm just feeling it .

Klaue smiles.On our way back, just drop us of in Wakanda.Yea I do . Killmonger suddenly draws a HANDGUN and SHOOTSLIMBANI DEAD. Reacting to the shot , Klaue crowds Linda with a skilled GRAPPLINGMOVEand snatches her gun away before she can fire on him . Killmonger finds Klaue holding Linda's gun to her head, using her as his shield .It's gonna be ok . Killmonger fires without hesitation . The BULLET TRAVELS THROUGH Linda , ki lli ng her while Klaue dives behind the plane , WOUNDED THE SHOULDER IN from the round . Killmonger moves to finish Klaue but he's gone . Following Klaue's blood trail , Killmonger STALKS Klaue through theI ain't worried about no brand . Check these out.

Killmonger opens his bag , revealing KLAUE'S CORPSE W'Kabi'sI'm standing in your house . Serving justice to a man who stole your vibranium and murdered your people . Justice your King couldn't deliver. T'Challa walks close enough to Killmonger to be able to whisper to him .Y'all sittin' up here comfortable. Must feel good . There's about 2 billion people all over the world that looks like us but their lives are a lot harder , Wakanda has the tools to liberate them all .Vibranium . Your weapons.Not your own?

You ain't the son of a King you're the son of a murderer!Hey Auntie .I'm exercising my blood right to challenge for the mantles of King and Black Panther . Utter silence as all eyes turn to T'Challa . T'Challa desperately wants to refuse but knows that isn't possible .Weeks? I don't need weeks. The whole country ain't gotta be there I just need him ... and somebody to get me out of these chains.I killed in America, Afghanistan, Iraq . I took life from my own brothers and sisters right here on the continent . And all this death , just so I can kill you . T'Challa looks to Zuri and nods .This is for my father . Killmonger walks swiftly toward T'Challa to deliver his deathblow .. . only to have a guilt-ridden Zuri STOP HIM with his SPEAR knocking his blade away .I'll take you both , Uncle James ...

Killmonger drives the spear in further and GRABBINGTHE BLADE with both hands in death, Zuri falls with it to the shallow water as T'Challa watches in utter torment .Is this your King? Huh? T'Challa swings his spear, Killmonger ducks .Is this your King? The Black Panther , who's supposed to lead you into the future .Him? He's supposed to protect you. Killmonger ducks another attack from T'Challa and scoops him onto his shoulders .Nah . I'm your King .Well maybe your home is the one that's lost . That's why they can't find us.

Alarmed , the shamans don't move, hoping Killmonger doesn't mean it ... but he does .When I tell you to do something , I mean that shit . Burn it all ! He lets her go as she gasps for air . Shell-shocked , the shamans move into action .You know, where I'm from, when black folks started revolutions , they never had the firepower or resources to fight their oppressors . Where was Wakanda? Hmm? Yea all that ends today. We got spies embedded in every nation on Earth . Already in place . Killmonger stands and walks looking each of them in the eye.I know how colonizers think. So we're gonna use their own strategy against them . We' re gonna send vibranium weapons out to our War Dogs . They'll arm oppressed people all over the world, so they can finally rise up and kill those in power, and their children and anyone else who takes their side . It ' s time they know the truth about us . We're warriors. The world's gonna start over and this time we're on top . Killmonger sits .The sun will never set on the Wakandan Empire. Okoye looks to W'Kabi .You heard your orders. Let's get to it. W'Kabi salutes while Okoye looks on .Have the spies been alerted?Look at this. A handheld sonic cannon powerful enough to stop a tank . Untraceable by metal detectors, and we got thousands of 'em. The world's gonna find out exactly who we are . Across from them, a TALONFIGHTER takes off, loaded with cargo . Killmonger watches, then turns to W'Kabi. As they smile the talon fighter EXPLODESin the air above them, startling Killmonger, W'Kabi, Okoye and the remaining Wakandans . They watch in shock as the debris rains down from the sky . Killmonger looks closely , trying to make something out.All that challenge shit is over with . I'm the King now. Get those planes in the air ! Carry out the mission !W'Kabi , kill this clown .I don't need a suit to kill you . They look at each other from across the blinding fast train .Your reign is over. You sat up here safe and protected.No I learn from my enemies -- beat them at their own game .The world took away everything away from me! Everything I ever loved ! But I'm gonna make sure we're even.I'm gonna track down anyone who would even think about being loyal to you , and I'm gonna put they ass in the dirt , right next to Zuri. Hatred flashes over T'Challa's eyes as he reengages his mask and the train clears. Killmonger engages his mask , and they leap at each other again .Hell of a move . Killmonger struggles to breathe.My pops said Wakanda was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen. He promised he was going to show it to me some day . Can you believe that? Kid from Oakland running around believing in fairy tales. Killmonger winces from the pain . T'Challa stands and picks Killmonger up , dragging him to his feet .It's beautiful . T'Challa thinks for a long beat.Why? So you can just lock me up? Nah . Just bury me in the ocean, with my ancestors that jumped from the ships . . . 'cause they knew death was better than bondage.

I'm much more your speed.It's an old mining tool that I made some adjustments to. But I can get you one if you'd like .He's right outside , why don't you ask him yourself?Bingo .What do you actually know about Wakanda?It's all a front . Explorers searched for it for centuries . El Dorado : The Golden City . They thought they could find it in South America, but it was in Africa the whole time . A technological marvel. All because it was built on a mound of the most valuable metal known to man- Isipho- they call it . The gift . Vibranium ...It's not just a metal ... They sew it into their clothes , it powers their city, their tech, their weapons ...Oh yes . Makes my arm cannon look like a leaf blower .All of it? I took a tiny piece of it . They have a mountain full of it. They've been mining it for thousands of years and still haven't scratched the surface .I'm the only outsider who's seen it , and got out of there alive.I see you took your time didn't you ! Killmonger continues to FIRE as Lirnbani and Linda hop in and begin to pull off.I sell to the highest bidder . Don' t you worry when I get back to Jo- burg and lay low for a bit, I ' ll make sure both you guys get paid.You don't wanna go there, boy .... Y-You really wanna go to Wakanda? They're savages. Klaue shows his BRANDEDneck .This is what they do to people like us.You can sca r yourself as much as you like . To them , you'll just be an outsider. You're crazy to think that you could walk in there . Killmonger flips the inside of his bottom lip, revealing a glowing Wakandan TATTOO.

I see a short cut .We're not going to make it!Wool Brother !Hey , what was that ! ?Hey, look at your suit! You ' ve been taking bullets charging it up with kinetic energy !

T'Challa hurries up the ramp. Hoping for good news, W' Kabi approaches T'Challa .Don't scare me like that, colonizer .Yes , I know . Everett Ross former airforce pilot and now, CIA.There is vibranium all around us. That's how I healed you.

Strongest metal on Earth.Weapons?That's a nice fairy tale but Wakanda is a third world country and you stole all their vibranium .Your father to l d the UN that Klaue stole all the vibraniurn you had .
