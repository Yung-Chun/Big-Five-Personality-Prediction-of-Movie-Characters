You don't look like much of a Detective.Charming.Save your breath. I really don't care.Why don't we can the chit-chat. Get to what's on your mind.No shit?Why should I?You may want to put a leash on him. Saying I did want to help... I'm still suspended or did that slip your mind?Just like that?Always a catch.You mean ex-partner.For a moment there, I thought you cared.I appreciate the words of encouragement and the confidence you have in me. I look forward to the continuing, positive relationship we've shared in the past.I'll give you two... Blow me. If you need a follow-up comment let me know? Cunt made her career off me.Teddy, Vincent... ... Nice to see you both.I was not responsible...Fuck you. Look who's talking about destroying lives.I'm going to miss him.You're just a wealth of knowledge, aren't you?I'm sure it won't be the last. Get me a line into the bank. Let's see what they really want.Who am I speaking with?Okay, Lorenz, how are we doing in there? Can we get you anything? Food, medical supplies. We heard an explosion.My fame proceeds me.I was, but I'm back. You're information's old.Yes.Someone's dead?What else will I be looking for?Safe to say.Lorenz...Wait, we're talking here...Try again.Try again.Where's our fearless Captain?So you're here in his place.Nicotine gum.Caffeine, too, if you must know. What? A man's capable of change.Don't worry, I still have a vice or two.Try again in five.Precisely. He knows police protocol, not to mention the shit in our own precinct. He's disguising his voice, means he's got a record and has done this before. He's heavily armed and well-connected. He knows he's surrounded. He hasn't asked for a damned thing. He drops that hint about sunrise, prepping us for a long wait. He's buying time. Why?Probably thought it would take the whole day for you to find me. Giving him the time he needs.Or... he's got what he came for and he's waiting for his ticket out of here. We're going in.The bank has three points of entry. Teddy and Vincent, take a SWAT Team, head to the West side. We'll have the SWAT Commander take the East. Dekker, you're with me. Where is the SWAT Commander?You questioning me, Teddy?I question how you can fuck that asshole and still manage to look in the mirror.The hostages are in imminent danger. They've confessed to killing someone, an automatic murder one charge - that's a life sentence, maybe a needle for all of them. So why keep witnesses around to testify? Longer we wait, the greater the risk. We need to go in. Now.What's the best way in?Hold on. No explosives. I got forty civilians in there, too great a chance. Any other way?What if we cut the power? That will disable the system and we can open the locks manually, come in that way?So we'll take the pussy way, Commander. We cut the power and go in at 11:15 sharp!It will be over before that. Commander, your men in position?I will call for the power to be cut. Once down, wait for my signal and enter. No one moves until I give the \"go\", understood?You have done this before, right? Wait... I don't want to know.Let's go around the horn.Here we go... Cut the power.Doors!Hold it. What just happened?No. Do not go in. It's a trap!SONOFABITCH!The rest of you, come with us.We split up. You two with him. You two with me. Check the back.See anyone come your way?We let them walk right past us.SHIT!I want background checks on every hostage. They're all suspects until they're not.After this, nothing would surprise me.What's with this one?So we can't ID them.They're long gone by then. Go to the head of the tapes, from when they first went in. Document each move they've made for the two hours they were inside.Have Vincent check it out.Shit. Feds.What does that mean?This is all real fascinating shit, but what about the money? Bank robbers still like cash, don't they?Depends, are we talking about your sex life? Because I've heard shortcomings.You came to me. I didn't ask for this.You wanted this to happen.You don't say.What?Try that again?That'll be all. You're a College boy. Which one? Someplace I've heard of or one of those inbred state schools no one's heard of?Not exactly Princeton, but not bad. How did you end up on the force?Family business? What, your Dad, Dad's Dad and so on and so back?You've grown on me. Besides, I am entrusting my life to you. I should know something about you. I wouldYou don't say that with much enthusiasm.Listen, my reputation often proceeds me. You, however, have no reputation; a fact I need to deal with. After you've been through the shit I have, then you can judge me. Now... we can try to work together, make the best of a bad situation or we can compare Dick sizes all day... Up to you. But since this is your first day here... today... mine's bigger.Go.Lastly... I don't like the Pac-10. It's overrated. I'm an Ivy League guy.Well, that explains you.Got an address?Step back. Clear the door. Now.I'm fine.He wakes, they call. Hey Quincy, give it a rest, I'm fine.I should do a lot of things.I'm fine.No.Of course she doesn't. Vincent!Have'em put Ms. Lopez in interrogation one and turn the A/C on full. Leave her alone and cold. Let me know when her nipples can cut glass.Your father was Harry Dekker?That was some fancy riding. You have a bike?Somebody going on a trip?Marnie, you're looking well.Can we get back to work?Is that new?Do you remember who headed up the Pacific Savings case?No reason. Just thinking out loud.When you said it was your \"family business\" I didn't think... I guess I just didn't connect the dots.Your father was a hero.At first I thought maybe you were related to the Captain.The Captain, he just kind of \"discovered\" you. Through the academy, to excellent evaluation reports, whileThat's how he found me.Maybe we're not as different as you think.We found the money.That money came from our evidence room.So, where were you going?This isn't possession or solicitation, Gina. This is felony-murder one. You could get life.It's \"I didn't do anything.\" \"Didn't do nothing\" is a double negative, infers the positive. The grammar in this country sucks.This isn't going away. You want to walk out of here, you tell me something... now.You sure that's what you want?Fine. Then it's two phone calls I'll make. The first will be to the public defender's office. The second to children's services.It's simple... if you insist on a lawyer, I take your kids.Not like you cared about them anyway. You were ready to fly the coop with \"Shit-for-brains.\"I can and I will.Tell me what I want to know!Get her some coffee... Something hot.I think for the first time in that girl's life she's telling the truth.Who would've known? It would've been my word against hers. Who do you think the jury would've believed?The only line around here is the `blue line', you cross that one, then you gotBuzz us in.Have another donut, Frankie.That fat fuck is the sole guardian of the city's biggest source of contraband. Drugs. Weapons. Cash.Not if you were a cop. You could just walk right in and...... Take whatever you want. Shit.So what... He showed you a warrant? What?You don't remember?The money from Richards's place traced back to the Pacific Savings heist a few months ago, a case Callo headed up.He doesn't need another reason to be pissed at me.They never do, Captain.Doesn't matter what I think. Facts here speak for themselves.Then come and get me you piece of shit.What they told Callo was the plan and what the plan really was may be two different things. Clearly this wasn't part of a plan Callo would've agreed with.As cops we come across every temptation in the book. Money, drugs, power. We'd all like to think we can resist any urge, but... We're not saints.Man said he wanted vengeance.Me?Nothing about today makes sense.Don't look at me, he's your find.Shutup.What?He moved it. Changed the angle. He didn't want us to see something.If I worried about every threat made against me, I'd never leave the house.Those are priority one. If he's got a record, I want an I.D. yesterday.Dax, can you hack in there and find out what they were doing on this machine?You like Italian?No, four. More are coming.For all intents and purposes... he's Big Brother.No.A little wine.Last time I was here, you said that table in the corner was the \"best in the house.\"Shane, what was that thing you said back at the house about \"returning to the beginning path\" or something?We're all ears.Continue.We have a genuine philosopher in our midst.What are you doing?It's too late. You've made your choice. Live with it.You got a name?Sonofabitch.Prick used to work for some big-time software company until they caught him dipping into the company's slush fund. They didn't want the publicity so they didn't press charges. Couple years later, he was busted for looting the pension plans of retired cops. For a genius... he's a fucking moron.His lawyer put us on trial. Said we were crooked, abusive, that we planted evidence... We were in the midst of the Pearl Street Bridge fallout. Jury bought it. They let him walk and we were the scapegoats.The guy was guilty. He was scum. That was the truth. There's something they don't teach you. The system breaks down. You have to compensate to get results.Break, no. Bend... if it means justice... Absolutely.You okay?First day in the city and you've already been shot.Take five, guys.Hiya, Damon. How you feeling?You fuckin' hypocrite. You give me shit for my interrogating skills... least I don't threaten them with a lethal overdose.You never think of the repercussions. The suspect's mother, father... Brother. How your decision affects them. He had murder in his eyes.It was pouring. Lights everywhere. If he had only done what I said.Drop the weapon.But it was not to be.So why become a cop?We go now all we get is Galt and Harrington. We want Curtis. Now relax and keep the line free.Shit.I'm out of gum.We hold. No one move.No. Stand down.No. No go. We wait.We have three cars here and uniformed backup in all directions, if they ride, we'll get them. I want Curtis. We don't go in that house until I say!Trigger happy, Sons of bitches!We take them alive!Teddy!? What's happening?GUN!Drop the weapon. Let the girl go.Think about this... you kill her, where are you going to...There's a passage in the Surangama Sutra which, roughly translated means: \"Things are not what they appear to be: nor are they otherwise.\"Think about that a minute... Doesn't that blow your mind? What gave me away?At the diner. That's right... Well, to err is human.Was it Harry that gave him up?That wasn't him. That was my mistake. I called you.I didn't kill anyone who didn't deserve it.York always thought \"the plan\" was flawless. He was cocky. I told him you have to leave room for error. You can't always predict how it's all going to play out. A random camera catches an image of Richards, the scent on the money... you. You were the biggest wrench of the day. The Chaos Theory... When you got that... I was impressed.The more information you gather, from as many sources as possible, no matter how unpleasant the methods are, the better. And while I'd like to take sole credit it was a team effort.She'll get over it.Scott Curtis won't be bothering anyone again.Who got killed? Curtis? Harrington, Galt, Lei. They're all hoods. The world's safer with them gone. The kid at the bank... that was unfortunate. But... you live with your decisions. You choose to take this road... there is no half way. It's all or nothing. That's why others fail. They don't make the commitment. I won't make that same mistake.Callo deserved his fate. It's his fault.If it weren't for him, York and I would've never done this. One random act, causes another, causes another, and in the end... the pattern emerges. That's the Chaos Theory. It's after six. The money's cleared. I'm a wealthy man. Lei, for all hisThey should've suspended me after I testified. What did they expect?Everybody who screwed us, got screwed. Everything in its right place.This wasn't about killing, Shane. This was about standing up for what matters. Besides... you kinda grew on me.I already have. I'm not even here now. This is a very valuable lesson for you to learn, and it's good to have learned it early.You don't always win.I'm an opportunist. I would've gladly died in the line of duty, but they took that away. If they had been as faithful to me, as I to them none ofNo thank you.

I was going to say the same about you.Because people's lives are at stake. That takes priority over your ego.Yes, Captain.Went uptown to brief the Commissioner.No, he wasn't expecting you. He said, he thought you were still suspended.He almost has what he came for.Holy shit...?!Round up all the hostages, anyone that comes out, grab'em!Excuse me... I need to listen to the conversation between Lorenz and Conners again?How long?Show me how to play it myself?Along with whatever they stole and this war zone they left behind... A man's dead, and the killers are running free. I don't have time to wait. I'll figure it out. Thanks for your help.Thank you.I think this Lorenz was trying to tell us something.The way he spoke... he paused before certain words. Have you ever heard of the Chaos Theory?Edward Lorenz invented the Chaos Theory in the 1960's. It's the study of phenomena that appear random, but in fact have an element of regularity which can be described mathematically.Pretty much... initial state of events may seem unrelated and random, but eventually patterns emerge and in the end all the pieces fit together.U Dub.It's kind of the family business.Do we really need all this \"get to know you\" crap? Couple hours ago you didn't give a shit.I know about you, Detective. Everyone does.Not much to be enthusiastic about.What's he doing back on the street?You hit?FREEZE!Stay down!Control her!Suspect fleeing on foot. North on Curson. He's armed and dangerous. I'm in pursuit.I'm a police officer in pursuit of a murder suspect. I need your bike, now!Girl's name is Gina Lopez, twenty- eight. Done some time for possession, has two kids... Am I interrupting?Gina claims she doesn't know anything about a bank robbery.Thanks.Used to, but I sold it. They're dangerous.Must be a fifty large there easy. His cut?It's not?That sounds familiar.What is it?So this money's not from our bank.Don't worry about it.Yes he was.No. No relation.Something like that.You believe her?You had to know, once she asked for a lawyer anything she told us would have been inadmissable.Justice by any means. Even if you cross the line.You'd have to have some major firepower, not to mention an extra large set of balls to try and knock off a police station.Bernie Callo.No they don't. We haven't asked the question... Why, if Callo's involved, don't they ask for him at the bank? They asked for you.Well, that's it, right?You'd think a cop would be smarter.So, Callo was involved and now they're dragging you into it. Why?Piss anyone off lately?Let me get this straight, they didn't touch the cash or the safe deposit boxes. So, they... break into a bank, blow it up, and steal nothing? Still make sense to you?\"Return to the earth now if your mind is troubled and your heart is uncertain. For it is by returning to the beginning that we can clearly see the path.\"We go back to where this all started. We go to the bank.Wait, hold on a second. Did you see it?Go back a little.Notice the camera angles, they're all fixed. They don't rotate or pan.There. Stop. Play it. Look closely, camera five, the vault cam, dominates our attention because of the explosion. But while that's happening, check out Camera two, customer service.What's in that corner they didn't want us to see?Are you at all concerned that there's some whacko out there looking to get you?What do we do in the meantime?We're still on duty. No wine.It's a Buddhist story.One day the Buddha found his heart in turmoil. So he retreats to the forest, to the earth, to the base of a great tree and, I'm paraphrasing, but... this elephant comes up and tells Buddha he doesn't like seeing him discouraged.He's the Buddha. He's attained the 6th level of consciousness. He's capable of communicating with plants, trees... even rocks.You asked.The Buddha was troubled so he went back to where he came from, the beginning, to find the path, the answer. So when you hit a dead end, go back to the beginning to find your way. Or something like that.No. Just something I picked up along the way.Not particularly.You're all pretty tight.I guess I just thought... I don't know. With all the trouble he's been in lately, coming back from suspension, everyone would treat him differently.The divine in himself.How long does it usually take to for fingerprints to be ID'd?Dekker./ Okay. They got a match.We got a match.Chris Lei.This was your case. You and York. You made the bust. Why didn't it stick?Was it true?That gives you the right to break the rules?Another thing they don't teach you.Yeah.Why don't I \"just graze\" you with a bullet and see how you feel.May I?You remember me, don't you? Thought so.I was skiing about three years ago. Aspen. Beautiful country. Ever been? Never mind. I hit a mogul, landed on a sheet of ice and slammed into a tree. Broke myself up pretty bad. Kinda like you did today. I was in a hospital bed for three months. Had it not been for... Here it is. Morphine. Without this stuff, I wouldn't have made it.Now this IV drip administers a small dosage every minute. Makes you feel relaxed and calm. No pain. But...If I were to inject this whole thing... That would be all she wrote for Damon.This equipment malfunctions all the time. Overdoses are quite common. Besides, I don't think the DA's going to launch a full-scale investigation over a scum like you.You don't have to tell us a damn thing. Plead the fifth... roll the dice.There's never been a single case in recorded medical history of someone overdosing on 200 milliliters of saline.Bend, not break. That's what you said, right?John Curtis.My father died when I was twelve. He walked into a liquor store in the middle of a stick up. Guy just opened fire. Never even had time to react. They said he was a hero. Know whatFinish what he started. Every day he went out, trying to do some good. Help the people who couldn't help themselves, just give'em a chance is what he always said. Didn't always work out right, but he tried. You tried to help save that girl on the bridge. If you weren't there, the girl still would've died. She had a chance because you were there. That's all we can do.What?Shit.All units, all units. Shots fired! Requesting backup immediately!Conners!Where's Conners?We can't.Teddy...No, Captain. She said it perfectly.Shame on you.Find another source.Meaning?Come again?Where's the money now?How is that possible?It's still moving the money around?Or 6 AM Pacific time. Sunrise. So why break in? If they're just wiring money? Couldn't they do that from anywhere?A billion dollars is missing and we're only discovering this now?So they weren't trying to make it look like they were robbing a bank, to rip off a Saudi Prince? They were making it look like they ripped off a Saudi Prince to rob a bank. The Chaos Theory.Dekker.Put it through.It's not over yet.No. My wish is to catch you. You're a murderer. A cop killer at that.I know about the money. You steal a billion dollars... They will find you.Callo's insignificant.That's what he said, Callo's insignificant. But he wasn't.Lorenz... Curtis... Called me.He said he didn't kill anyone who didn't deserve it. He said Callo was insignificant. But without Callo he wouldn't have had the knowledge of our department and... ... He wouldn't have had the front money to hire the crew.How did he come at you, Harry? It's the only thing that doesn't make sense.All day long we thought Callo was the dirty cop. All day long we were wrong.That's the sign-out sheet from the evidence room. Here's one of Callo's reports. Here's another one... and another --They're not the same signature, Harry. They're not even close.This is your file... You were reprimanded, a month ago after you confronted Callo at the courthouse. You punched him. That ring a bell?So you set him up! You forged Callo's signature, you gave him the money and you helped him with his plan because you thought he got a raw deal at Pearl Street Bridge! Don't deny it, Harry cause I know.You're helping a cop killer, Harry. You're a year from pension. This is how you want to go out?This has been a very long, trying day. And I'm tired. We're chasing aHow the hell does Curtis know Conners better than anyone?We're not talking about Curtis, are we, Harry? Who would know Conners better than anyone? Who would you protect? And who in your mind got the raw deal at Pearl Street Bridge?It was York who was the bad cop. He assumed Scott Curtis's identity to throw us off the trail.York plays his old partner, knowing all his moves, frames his enemy for the crime, kills him too and pulls off the biggest robbery in history.Watch me.Can they get a location on him?No. If there's a signal. Means he's still here. He's waiting for something or someone.175th street... There's is one place.Detective Galloway...Jason York... this is the police. Put your hands in the air and slowly get on your knees. Do it. Now!Get down on the pavement!GET DOWN NOW! FINAL WARNING!Take the back!Let the girl go. It's over.Drop the weapon, let the girl go.That you don't want to do.Shit.Which way did he go?FBI's got a team of 40 computer technicians figuring out Lei's virus. They'll break it.They said in the city I'd be busy. Every day like this?Great. I wonder what's next?How much?Thanks.What is it?You tried them all?/ Nothing for Conners or Lorenz?/ I don't know. No, maybe he's not on a flight.Try again. But try Gleick. James Gleick.Conners?Ten bucks.Harry and the phone call. He called me, said Callo was insignificant. Threw up a red flag.All day long, we were trying to find out who the inside source was... it was you.Teddy's pretty devastated about your death.So the corpse in the morgue with your name on its toe...?You're a serial killer.You said they were all hoods... what about, Callo?This is Callo's fault?Lei... you tanked his trial on purpose.And because the \"bitch that made her career off you\" worked for Channel Two, that's why American National was the target.Why not kill me?
