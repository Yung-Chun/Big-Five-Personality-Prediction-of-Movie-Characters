Great picture, great picture.What's with this \"Mr. Appleton\" crap? Your boss hiding in there?What's that mean?Louise... what gives?Sort what out? Are my pages done?They took 'em? Who took 'em? Louise, what's going on...Leo... what's going on?I... I don't believe this.Who the hell is this \"they?\"No. Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did. Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor. I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em. I didn't believe in what they were saying. Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt. You know me, I'm non- political. Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!What? That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?Leo, you're my agent. Tell \"them\" to take a flyin' piss. I didn't do anything wrong. I fought in the war, for crissakes!I was decorated.Exactly.At least I was on our side! Look, they want me to testify? I'll testify. I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear! Jesus, Leo, this is my career!Why not?Yeah, well, that's enough.\"Ashes To Ashes?\"So, it is a blacklist.Yes. Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!Huh. Red...What exactly did you hear?I wasn't alone. Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy. But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.A lot of good people are being accused of things they didn't do. Hell, even if I was a communist, this is America, goddammit, a person should be able to be whatever they want to be! Right?Will you help me, Sandy?So nice to be a pariah.Bought the bottle, didn't I? To the United States of America. Long my she wave.Thanks, Jerry. Tell me something.You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?Zackly.Too bad. He says I'm a communist.You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?This is not a bender yet. This is the start of a bender. But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike.Sandra Sinclair.Sandra Sinclair. Wanna know her real name? Bella Iskowitz. No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else. Even you. Even me. Especially me. I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.Nope. Can't. We're through.I'll save you the trouble. I'm a cab. There. Did it myself.'Sides, car's right outside. I'll be seein' ya, Jer.Drive. Drive. Bad idea. Too drunk to drive.One-thirty. Huh! Early. Can't go home yet.Oops.Huh? Whatsa...Shit.Oh my god! I don't believe... oh my god...I... I don't know.I... yes, I think so.My head hurts.Ancestors?I suppose. Thanks.I'm... I... I honestly don't know.They all know you?The war...Yes. Very.Pie's... good.Thanks. More coffee?I'd remember this pie.Thanks. Great pie.Thank you, Mr. Lawson.No, sir.I don't remember. I guess so. Smells like it. Tastes like it.I guess I did.Thanks.It's possible. I just don't remember.I... no, I... I just can't...Call me... Ishmael?She's very pretty.Wish I could say the same thing.Yes.No. But...Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.\"It's a Wonderful Life.\"\"It's a Wonderful Life?\"I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.My father...?The Bijou?We live in a theater?Am I under arrest?I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out. I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.I already have.My girlfriend. If she still is...No. No, not Miss Sinclair. I'm talking about Adele Lardner.No. Absolutely not.Let's close up.Who's that?Hi.Yeah? I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke. I know who I am now, and you don't. And... I don't like me very much.Thanks, I like it. I think.Delly, I want to do the right thing.The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.Come on, Delly, look at the country today. We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb... You think they want \"suspected communists\" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, \"Sand Pirates of the Sahara?\"What about you, Delly?You'll stand by me?Well, that's a relief. I understand they usually don't let that stop them.And I won't be a communist anymore.So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.That's not the country Luke fought for.It's wrong, Leo.You found him.This is a great honor. I'll treasure this always. Thank you.\"I, Peter Appleton, do hereby renounce my membership in the American Communist Party, and by way of purging myself of my indiscretion, wish to provide the following names of fellow members to this committee, so that those persons may have the opportunity to do as I have done...\"Jesus...Old Tim?Sure. Come on in. I was just packing.Please, sit.The customers? I don't know...Tim, I have to tell you something.It's about me.I'm... I'm not Luke. Luke is dead. He died in the war. He's not coming back, and I'm not him. I don't even belong here. This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is. An accident.My name isn't Luke. It's Peter. Peter Appleton.I thought you...Yeah. Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.I wish you were coming with me.Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector. You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...Damn...Delly... thanks, thank you. I'll take good care of this.Okay. What's the second thing?I do.Peter Kenneth Appleton. Hollywood, California.I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.A statement?Um... no. I don't have a statement at this time.Sir, that is true.Luke Trumbo? We never met. But I'd like to think I know him.Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around. I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him. That's all.Yes, sir.Yes sir. But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.Yes.I'm sorry, what was the question?Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.Yes... yes, I do.Yes it does.Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now? They're two different things?Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.Well, that's what I knew then. Or who I knew, I should say. You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom. I went to the meeting to impress her.Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom...You asked for the truth. That's the truth. I had no idea what the meeting was about. I just sat through it so I could be near her. I'm sure even a Majority Counsel like yourself is familiar with the concept of impressing a girl.Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college. I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?I know that a lot of good, honest, decent people, people that I consider my true friends, feel betrayed by me, not because of who and what I am, but because of what you say I am! I know that I...No, sir.I'm not refuting anything.That's not a contradiction at all, sir. I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.I'm a little hesitant to say.Well, I went as... a horny young man.I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong. Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.I... Mr. Chairman, I have a prepared statement I'd like to read...\"I, Peter Appleton, do hereby...\"I... I need a drink of water.Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment. I wonder if you're familiar with it.\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\"That's the First Amendment, Mr. Chairman. It's the backbone of this nation. It's everything that gives us the potential to be right and good and just -- if only we'd live up to that potential. It's what gives me the right to sit in this chair and say my piece before this committee without fear. It's the most important part of the contract that every citizen has with this country. And even though this contract... ... the Constitution and the Bill of Rights -- even though they're just pieces of paper with signatures on them -- they're the only contracts we have that are most definitely not subject to renegotiation. Not by you, Mr. Chairman, not by you, Mr. Clyde, not by any member of this committee -- or anyone else -- ever.And when you get right down to it, that's really all I have to say to this committee. Good morning.I don't know...No, of course not...Look, fellas, I don't have anything to say...I'm not sorry for what I said.No thanks.Luke didn't smoke.Not any more.Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did. You think they're gonna let me write pictures? Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.What do you mean?Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.Her name was right there in front of them. They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...Oh god, oh, god, no, I...Thank me publicly? For what? For ruining this woman's life?Thanks...Western Union, please.Bob, congratulations! When'd you ask her?I see you got the telegram.Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you. This is me, Delly. Pete Appleton.

Yes, yes it looks just fine.Oh, yes, plenty. Plenty.Sweet Jesus...Cecil! Cecil, there's a young man in there...Listen to me! The young man in there...Cecil, listen to me!It's Luke.I knew all along. I knew you were alive! Oh, Luke...Only one in town. Get in, son.Harry, son. Harry.Albert Lucas Trumbo. But you've been \"Luke\" since you were a baby.You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor. January seventh... nineteen forty-two.Nine and-a-half years ago.Well, son, you're home!Thanks for the lift, Cecil.Wait'll you see the inside!We've been closed for a while.Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess. Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco. Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this \"television\" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up. Broke mine, too. But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure. C'mon, I'll show you where we live.The day you shipped out. That was a proud day for your mother and me. Last time you saw her. Last time I saw you.Till today.That's Lily. Your mother, rest her soul.Well, yes, that she was. She certainly made this place a home.Can I get you anything? I can put some coffee on or some...When I woke up this morning, my son was dead. Now, I have my boy again. I have my boy again.'Morning, Son.Sleep well?They couldn't wait to see you.This is the staff of the Bijou.Six-thirty. I thought we'd get an early start.Oh, I'm sorry, they know you, but you don't... you need to be re- introduced. Luke, this is Mrs. Irene Terwilliger.And this fine fellow is our head usher, resident fix-it man and custodian. Luke, meet Old Tim. You remember Luke, don't you?Well, lots to do, so we'd better get a move on...'Fraid this has seen better days. Well, I was meaning to get a new screen, anyway.I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened. And you'll get one, too.Anyone want to see the projector?Beautiful. Bright and even from edge to edge. See for yourself.She's always been a bit tricky.No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.Gary Cooper. And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.Yes?Forty-two was a lean year around here. The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall. Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me. At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.I know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace! Any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you...... you were in a palace. It was like a dream. It was like heaven, like you died and went to a palace in heaven, that's what it was like. And spotless, too.Come with me!Maybe you had problems and worries out there, but once you came through that door, they didn't matter anymore. In here, you were safe. Maybe it was just an escape from reality, but... oh, god... it was beautiful.Charlie Chaplin. Keaton and Lloyd. Swanson. And later on, Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert and Jimmy Stewart and James Cagney and Bogart and Becall and Judy and Mickey... and Fred and Ginger.They... were... like... gods!And that... was the altar. Would you remember if I told you, we felt lucky to be here, to have the privilege of watching them? This television thing. Why would you want to sit at home and watch a little box with a little screen? Because it's convenient? Because you don't have to get dressed and put on a coat and a tie and a hat? Because you can just... sit there? How can you call that \"entertainment,\" all alone in your living room? Where are the other people? Where's the audience?Where's the magic?I'll tell you. In a place like this, the magic is all around you. All the time. Everywhere. In every thing.The trick... is to see it.Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did. You've got to remember that. You've got to.I take breakfast and supper at Mabel's every day except Sunday. Have for years, since Lily died. If it weren't for Mabel, I'd probably starve to death.It's really him, Ernie.Ernie.We were just gonna get some supper. Would you like to join us?Katie, would you like to join us for dinner? The more, the merrier.Carl. Friend of yours from high school. Everybody calls him \"Cueball.\"Gonna re-open the Bijou, that's what.If it's tough, that means it's worth doing.You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.Goodnight, son. 'Night, Delly.Yes?Nine hundred...They're...It's all my fault. I was neglectful and this is the price of that.Well, it's true. Wanting to open this place back up. It's folly, Irene, pure and simple. Might as well just call it what it is.Oh, no, I...Son, we're gonna go. You two kids have a lovely time.Beautiful, wasn't it?Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left. Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...Ha!You know, since you've been back, that's the first time you've called me \"Dad.\"Luke... what time is it?Oh, baby, make your daddy happy...You're a good girl. No matter what I say.Oh, Jesus...The film broke...Did you... did you...Did you... did you...Did you fix the damn film? It broke in the last reel.Anybody take it?Vultures...I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive. That's not too shabby, is it?Don't tell me, I know about these things. I've seen it before. It's all right. It's... all right. You're here.

How come Harry didn't mention that?Um, Old Tim? Sorry, it's late. It's Luke. Can I come in?Yeah. I hope you don't mind. I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry. And me.So I guess this fellow belongs to you. What's his name?Cat. That's simple. I like it. Hi, Cat.Of course.I'll do everything I can.Yeah... me too.Well...Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up.And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make. What are those?Oh.Evening, Doctor Lardner.What's wrong?Oh, you mean the suit. Harry kept all my old clothes. Fits okay, but it's a little big.I shouldn't have worn the suit.Oh...Aren't you coming?What?Oh.It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.Have you got a cigarette?I don't smoke?Oh.They're not bad.My what?Huh. That was nice of me.... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.No kidding.Nope. Just filling in the blanks.Thanks, Charlie.How do you tell those two apart, anyway?That's... pretty frightening.Thanks.Guess I must've learned.Why don't you two get out there and dance?When was that?Good to meet you. Again.Thanks.We're gonna try. Place needs a lot of work.Well, he loves the place. It's his home.That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?A super market. Huh.Yes.Dad, I...... what?Six-thirty. I thought we'd get an early start.Well, no... I wanted to thank you all for giving me such a nice welcome, and making me feel at home. But I... we're... actually here on business of a sort...Thanks. Well, I'll make this short and sweet. The Bijou needs a lot of repairs, and the truth of the matter is, Harry, um, that is, Dad and me, Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim, we can't possible afford them all. So, I'd like to ask your help to... well, to scrounge around a bit, and see if you have anything that might help us out.Oh, paint, brushes, plaster, light bulbs, yardage, and if you can't come up with any of that, we can use some old-fashioned elbow grease.Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou. There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...... but I think a good dose of magic is as good a place as any to start.That was beautiful.I can play the piano?No, I...\"Ha! I'd say I was winning!\"\"Gregory! Look out!\"Sandra...?My god... my god... no...What?Come on, folks, this happens every once in a while, just settle down...Harry! Harry, why don't you cut the projector and bring up the house lights?Harry? Harry...?Jesus...I know, I know... keep still.Get Doc Lardner.Can we get him to the hospital?I'm here.Did I what?I know. Everyone went home. We offered them refunds.A few.You're not going anywhere, Harry.And I love you... Dad.Sure.Your father said... that I would start to remember things.Well... everything. It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.Delly. I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father. And I'm not... I'm not Luke.I fell in love with you, too, Delly.

I think I passed.No hiccups, which was good. Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous? \"Your honor, I object!\"Dad? What is it?Oh my god... who died?I think it's worse now.Yeah, well it's not everyday you get news like this. You're sure he's okay? Other than the bump on the head?Dad...... including me. Right?You mean, me?Do you... remember me?No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.You look... different.Yeah, a little. I think you grew an inch or so. And you've lost weight.You can all go home, now. He's not going anywhere.Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?I know a place. Come on!You must not remember anything. Come on.You first.Be a gentleman. You have to help me down.When we were kids, my Dad was mayor, and you and me and a bunch of others used to come down here all the time.Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.Through the door. It comes apart.Your name's on here. See?Right here. \"Albert Lucas Trumbo.\" And all the others. I knew them all. So did you. We went to school with most of them.After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it. The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall. Everyone finally got tired of the fighting. So they stuck it down here.And why not?Sorry. You don't know how many times I've heard that. \"A lady lawyer? Are you crazy?\" Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man. Or better, in fact.You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman. And we were on the debate team together. But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much. And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.Actually, I was married. For four years. But... well, we didn't fit together. I'm divorced now.No, it's okay. See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?Yeah...Yes. Hic!Nothing.I'm fine. Really.Eventually. We were going to be engaged... when you came back from overseas...... but you had to go... serve your country...Hey... it worked.Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in? I'll be right down.Oh...No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...... and It's just... well, deja vu.Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.This is strange. Do you feel it?We've done this before, so many times. The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...Nine hundred...What about a loan? You could go to the bank...?Well, there's got to be a way...When did you start smoking?You tried to once. It was pretty pitiful.No, they're not. I'd say your investment was paying dividends.Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet. You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder. So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy. Bothered the hell out of you. But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...Exactly. And he got good.Now, did you remember that, or...Oh. Okay.Thanks boys, ya flatter me no end.It's called the State Bar Exam.Alex and Charlie? Simple. Alex is the smarter one.Your dancing's very good.It never used to be. You were two left feet on the dance floor. Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.Sure.What... do you remember?I see...Oh...Oh, god, I knew! I knew! I knew from the start! I wanted you to be Luke! I wanted you to be alive! You're so much like him, you have no idea. No wonder everyone else accepted you! You don't know what you -- what Luke meant to this town, suddenly being alive! You don't know what this town lost! You just don't know...I knew you weren't Luke! And I tried not to fall in love with you! And... I don't even know your name! Oh, god...No... I can't... I have to... I can't...Hi.I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.Oh, yes. Yes, he was.You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete. Pete. Pete. It's a nice name.I believe you.But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?Forget about all that. You want to do the right thing? Then defend your name. If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so. I know the law, and the law's on your side.I am, too.Whatever happens.Doesn't it bother anyone that this is a perversion of democracy?You've got everything?You'll be fine. No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side. Don't forget that.And who's gonna run the projector until you get back? Mrs. Terwilliger?Did you bring along something to read?I didn't think so. Here. This is mine, you can borrow it.Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you. You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.Just remember two things. First, the law is a living thing. It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes. But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.I'll be here... if you come back.That's perfect, Dad.They haven't called out the dogs yet.I spoke too soon.Tell them Pete. Tell them...Oh, Pete. No...Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you. I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...And I love you, Pete!", "clean_line": "dad bad thought think passed hiccups good wants attorney gets hiccups gets nervous honor object dad oh god died think worse yeah everyday news like sure okay bump head dad including right mean remember wondering ve time look different yeah little think grew inch ve lost weight home going feel like shadowed know place come remember come gentleman help kids dad mayor bunch come time course lot room stuck memorial door comes apart right albert lucas trumbo knew went school commissioned agree methodists wanted methodist church presbyterians wanted presbyterian church city council wanted lobby city hall finally got tired fighting stuck sorry know times ve heard lady lawyer crazy like woman couldn good lawyer man better fact remember yes little girl oh guess high school pretty good baseman debate team think gonna run bijou brought loved think knew town needed place like actually married years fit divorced okay people belong person key unlocks rest making sense yeah yes hic fine eventually going engaged came overseas serve country hey worked daddy luke let ll right oh wearing suit time went deja vu daddy trying figure new television set working strange feel ve times time long ago feels like yesterday know excited bijou opening loan bank got way start smoking tried pretty pitiful investment paying dividends heard benny goodman play time went got clarinet wanted able play like tried hard wasn long clear benny goodman looking shoulder gave clarinet spencer hidden agenda little spence follow like puppy bothered hell soon gave clarinet exactly got good remember oh okay thanks boys ya flatter end called state bar exam alex charlie simple alex smarter dancing good left feet dance floor like pulling teeth little box step sure remember oh oh god knew knew knew start wanted luke wanted alive like idea wonder accepted know luke meant town suddenly alive know town lost know knew weren luke tried fall love know oh god hi sure lot people worried sick oh yes yes know going calling pete pete pete nice believe went meeting care matter communist forget want right thing defend says untrue stand know law law happens bother perversion democracy ve got ll fine matter leo kubelsky says ve got seventy years american law forget gonna run projector mrs terwilliger bring read think borrow exactly light reading know believe ve read high school got way law school ll help won far near beginning remember things law living thing free keeps free gets twisted people purposes makes mistakes big mistakes end law prevails takes ll come perfect dad haven called dogs spoke soon tell pete tell oh pete pete sorry think come thought want write love pete"}}}
