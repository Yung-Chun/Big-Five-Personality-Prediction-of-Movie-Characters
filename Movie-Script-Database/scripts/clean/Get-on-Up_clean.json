Someone been in there, I hear the chain flush, I can smell it. Now who it was?Something funny?Then why you cats laughing?OK listen up people.Being it's Sunday and all I'm gone ask each of you to imagine you're sittin' in church right now. While today's sermon may be good they's something else on your mind. You realize you gotta take a shit.Real bad. And you don't want to shit at the church house, naw sir. So you just sit there and think about getting home to your own toilet in your own master bath on Beech Island, South Carolina. I gotta a bidet in my master bath. Love my bidet. And a big pretty oval tub too.You got a bidet, Sir?You?Well you gotta get you one. You all gotta get you a bidet. Are y'all sure its really Sunday today?What was just saying... Oh, that's right. Yes! You gotta take shit. So, after church, you speed back home and you run like hell to the house scared you ain't gonna make it. But you do. Now imagine unhitching your pants as your open your bathroom door. And then you see me. James Brown. Sittin' on your master toilet taking a break. What would you do?Good God. Tear up the devil. I'm gone have to get that fixed.Now I'm a busy man, and I'm guessin' you cats are too. But someone has abused a personal convenience. Now I ask you nicely. I'm gone ask you again. Which one of you gentlefolk hung a number two in my commode?Was it you, Sir? Was it you?!I ain't gone shoot nobody, son.Ma'am, it was you wasn't it? You took a break in my bathroom, didn't you?Yes you did. Now, don't cry. It's gone be okay.You had to use the toilet. You saw an opportunity and you took it. Yeah, I got mad but, Lady, you did right by yourself. I've spent my whole life doing right by myself. I'm James Brown and I made a difference.You cats may not own my records but you can bet every record you have got a piece of me in `em. Ain't nobody singing today that ain't been touched by James Brown.So, Lady, you did right by yourself. And there ain't no other way to live. You understand me?You understand me?Don't hurt me. Don't stop me. Don't stop me.Don't stop me. Don't stop me.C'mon. C'mon.\"I Don't Feel Noways Tired\".See Captain Jenkins, the James Orchestra is a 22 piece, but the Gov'ment or the Army, powers't be say I can only bring six fellas.

I go forward. And I live.I feel good! And I knew that I would now...I feel nice. Like sugar and spice.Take it and flip it.I feel good and I knew that I would now. So good. So good. Cause I got you.Thank you, Mr. Avalon. And please call me, Mr. BrownHow many times have I done this split Bobby?Exactly, and now the first and only time I rip my pants has to be in front of all those white people.My trumpet, bass, and drums are spread out all over this cold floor.Go get my towel!I'm seventeen...Know what that means, Big Junior? Means they can try me in Superior Court. Means they can send my juvenile ass down for a man's term. 3 maybe 4 years.You reach my daddy?I know he's in the Army. So you gotta go find him.What'd Aunt Honey say?Go find my daddy, Big. Please! Okay?So, he knows I'm here?Don't cry Junior. Don't cry now.Oh no Sir. Truth is I ain't really into all that so much. Not no more.It's just a old nickname is all. I'm looking for something stable. Steady. I want to be a Mechanic.Yes Sir. There's a fella I know back in Augusta, he owns a garage, he said he could find me a job if-What happened to you?Gee, that's too bad.Walk in the jungle sometimes you get bit by a snake.Say. What's that song you done?Only thing keeps me sane in here.Five to thirteen years.Robbed a suit.Tell me about it.Board say I need a permanent family address and a job.

I'm skinny but I'm strong. I can read a little bit and I like to sing. That's who's sittin' here.And I think God knew that when I took that suit that I might end up with you. I ain't never sat at a table with such a fine group of people in my life.I used to wish I could put that suit back, but now I'm here with y'all. Fried chicken. Green beans. Corn bread. Those nice curtains.A house smells good. I'm happy I stole that suit. And I thank you for having me here.Junior.Pretty girls.Pretty girls.What you talkin' about? Your hair is rising up to the Lord right? Like a flame.What you think \"Caldonia\" is, Nafloyd.We're the Famous Flames.The Famous Flames.Bobby. I can't make practice Thursday.

Except what we doin'.That us. We in there Bobby.But, it is beautiful. All those little grooves. That's us. It's been written.Now, men gone lay with women. That's nature. But a woman ain't never gone stop a real man from what he's supposed to do. That's God. Husband? Daddy? That gives a man purpose. Man gotta have purpose. But purpose don't stop me neither, Bobby. Ain't nothin' gone stop us. Nothin'. And that's God too.You gone smile for me, Teddy Brown?Come on, boy.No baby.Baby.

So we can turn the lamp down low till this sun rise up on us in the morning.Oh no.I ain't supposed to leave Bibb County without telling my parole officer.I can't go back to prison Bobby.Hi.Yeah. That's me.Wait...wait a second here-It ain't right. It's too slow. We gotta pick up the pace fellas.I need to come in early..push it. Drive it. Early. Before the beat. Then speed it up, man.I know it's a ballad, Mr. Bass. But a ballad is supposed to get her in the mood, not put her to sleep.But it ain't right.Please! Please! Please.Please! Please! Please!Well thank you Sir, we worked real hard to-I know what Mr. Bart is saying. I heard him. Loud and clear.I see where we goin'. Saw it this morning when your secretary called ask me to come here an hour early. Alone. I knew it six months ago. Hell, I knew it the day I was born.There's some things I'm gonna want.Bobby. It's just a name. Ain't nothing different between us. This for all us not just me. It's gone be good.I think a live album-But, Pop, you know my show.Mr. Nathan, you ain't ever even seen the show. My show.Mr. Nathan-What are you doing?That ain't the \"Mashed Potato\".Book the Apollo. I'm gonna spend my own money on this. Syd Nathan's wrong.Book it out next week for the whole week, go in, we drill it, we drill it, we drill it, then we drop it.I don't understand risk?I don't understand cos I'm just the \"show\"? Is that all I am to you, Pop? The show? The money?Sure it is. That's all me and my black brothers are to the \"White Devil\". We the show and you the money. And that's how the White Devil keeps it all.Pop, look me in the eye.Pop.Yeah, I'm the show. But, if I'm spendin' my own money on the show, then I'm gone be the business too.And after we kill The Apollo, I'll kick over a few bucks to the white devil. Whatever I think he deserves. And If I'm payin' you, Pop, you gone show me how to do it.And I want the best engineer in town. I don't care what it takes. I don't care what it cost. I want everyone in uniform, the ushers, front of house, the peanut peddlers.And I want `em in Sapphire blue suits. Pop. Sapphire.It's cold. It's cold. It's too cold man. It's too cold. Cold. Cold.C'mon. C'mon. C'mon. C'mon. C'mon.Gertrude. See if you can get some coffee for the folks in line.You ready Mr. Byrd?Watch me.You know I feel alright. You know I feel alright children. I feel aaaaaaaallllriiiiiiight.Think...Think...Think...About your bad self...Thank you. That's very kind of you.We gone celebrate tonight. And then tomorrow we gone Wilmington and do it to it all over again.Momma?Momma it's me. It's me.This for me? Looky this! We got us a chauffeur.Gimme the keys. What they payin' you?This here's a month's pay, help you get yourself another job. I gone drive myself.Don't mention it. That's six a month goin' somewhere else.Pop, see there's something I been meaning to ask you.I got a seventh grade education Pop, so you'll have to excuse me. I was looking over those figures you sent me, and something occur to me: we don't pay the promoter, the promoter pay us.-sure we planning, see I ask myself, what if we don't got fluctuating sales. What if you knocking the tar out of every show.I don't doubt it.What if we took the gate? What if we took it ourself.And still got the show promoted, but better.Lenny Franks a James Brown fan? How old he, sixty? Why's he gone try harder for James Brown than for Sam Cooke? Or Ray Charles. Or Tom Jones. See Pop. We go to the radio stations.You see my point right? OK. Listen up. We go to the radio station. We go to the young cats. The hungry cats. The late night cat.The twenty year old white deejay in Richmond Virginia who's getting paid nothing and is only doin' it because he loves music. We go to him we ask him if he want to be the sole James Brown promoter for the Richmond show. For a percentage. He gone say:Between nothing and fifty bucks a week. But he love my music. He digs James Brown. And he got a microphone and a turn-table and four hours airtime to kill.And at the end he gone say..Now because he's twenty he's got strong legs. And he knows everyone.He know the guy in the barber shop knows the guy at the pool hall, the guy at the garage.That way we get our record played outside Payola, we get our show promoted better, harder, cheaper, and we keep the gate.And the best part is, you can put it all through the books. Item. Promoter. What'd you think Pop?Why not?It's not a little. If the show sells, and it's sellin', we talking thousands of dollars a night. Difference per year between 2 and 3 million dollars.And there's my next point Pop. Why not?I can do something for you, and you can do something for me, and it ain't buy me no Cadillac. Did you buy Wilson Pickett a Cadillac? Did you buy Jackie Wilson a Cadillac? You know which way this thing is going Pop. I got people around me who don't see it.Who you play Sax with son?What's the rule?Not on the bus. Not backstage. You a talented horn player, son. You gotta keep your game tight. Now you wanna smoke a little groove on your own time, that's yo' business. But we out here to work hard and we gone do just that you dig? Fifty.Hello pretty thing. You want an autograph?You want to come with me? So I can sign it somewhere private?I called you yesterday, you ain't home.You were home all day.

Besides, we got a day off in two weeks in New Orleans. The boys can get their wives, girlfriends along, kick back. What's between Raleigh and Columbia? Spartanburg?Bobby? What's the name of the theater in Spartanburg...The Regal!On Howard Street and main. Hold about 750 people. Guy named Bennett used to own it. Yeah, Spartanburg. Yeah, we'll play there and I can bring in my masseuse from Anderson.Call `em up, Pop.Hey little man, you been good this year.Merry Christmas, Little Man.You stand up in James Brown's yard dressed like that? So every man can see you?Cover yourself up.See My great grandmother on my momma's side, she Asian. She got Asian blood. See Asians are a flexible race. You get with an Asian chick?

One. Two. Three. Four. Hit it.Stop. Maceo. What you doing man? You coming in maybe a little too late. What's the matter son. You lost your feeling?Something wrong, Maceo? Is something wrong, Maceo?You got something to say Mr. Byrd? Because a man got something to say he should say it. You got something to say?Well then you just HOLDING UP THE REHEARSAL Mr. Byrd.I can't have people HOLDING UP THE REHEARSAL. If I can't do it right I ain't gone do it at all. We got to GET ON. GET AHEAD. Now you know the rule.You late, you off or you hold us up, it's no good, Mr. Byrd. Its gonna cost you 50 dollars.Now are you ready Mr. Byrd. Are you ready Mr. Byrd?Good. I ain't fattening frogs for snakes. From the top. One Two...It goin' wrong there Pee Wee, when it rise up.Thank you! I like the part he playin' now. I just want it in a different place.What's this, Maceo.A snare what?Correct.What's this, Maceo?No it's not.What's that, Pee Wee?Now you're getting it.What's that he's holding.You Fellas. What are those shiny things you holding.Now we all got our drums. Now when you're playing the drum it don't matter what key you're in, what bar your in or what planet you on. Dig?Mother, she got to have. Say, you got to have a mother for me. Yeah, popcorn!Quit it. We missing something.Pee Wee, get over here by the microphone. And bring that horn box. That's where you keep the wig, right?What is it? Why we stop Henry?What? What is it?Get the Mayor on the phone.Mr. Mayor, the way I see it, you already lost your next election. You lost it at 7:05 PM Memphis time.Now tomorrow night, you either got 10,000 angry folks in the Boston Garden, or you got 10,000 angry folks on your front lawn. Take your pick son. Which one you want?Brother before I get to this next thing I wanna say. He's a young man you dig. He's a young man so he's thinking together. The man is together. Give him another round of applause.Hit it.Wait a minute. Step off. Move off. I'll be a'ight here. I be fine.Do you wanna dance son? You dance.C'mon. C'mon now. Y'all go down. Go back down.

Hit that thing man.In America today you've either got to be an entertainer or a ball player or what? If you poor, young and black, what is there? And you ask me why they on the street? It ain't politics we watchin'. It's economics.You got kids out there that can't eat, robbing and stealing and doing what they have to do to make it. And if you don't do something about it we gonna lose the country. I go to Harlem, talk to Rap Brown, talk to the Nation they call me a separatist. Here we're on our way to the White House, Pop, and they already calling me an Uncle Tom. So what I supposed to do?Write a check for Rap so he buy rifles, machine guns, rally on 125th and take it south? What it say to you, a street kid from Augusta, Georgia in the White House?You asking me to turn this plane around and stand up the President?So here I am. Just a sorry soul brother whining inside his private jet, huh?I want to go to Vietnam. I want to show unity for the boys out there. The beleaguered, the tired and in the dark.And we need to bring awareness, and Mr. President, we need to bring the super heavy funk.Take it and flip it.Hit it.Quit it. Bring `em in.How we all doin'. Hope this ain't too late for you folks.I brought you all here today so I could tell you something very important. I want you all to know that you can do or be anything you want in this world.

And then you gotta learn it... and that's when you earn it.We ready fellas?I think about a lot of things. About problems. About solutions.
