Look, what do you say we, uh...This business, Captain?Does that paper say we've been indicted? Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?Captain, what do you want?Dudley, what do you want?Yeah, I hate them.What's going to happen to Stensland? He'll give himself cirrhosis over this. He's one year from his pension.He helped me out once. That's all.Him and me both. Fucking Exley.What do you want?Doing what?

And I think you already know who I mean, so cough it up.Give me both. Billing first.You must slay 'em at the country club.Are you Pierce Patchett?I'm a homicide detective. Where were you last night?Richard Stensland.Officer White. How about Susan Lefferts? You know her?We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve. This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl. I'm investigating.Where's the other guy? Buzz.Thanks, but no thanks.I don't have one. Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it. How come?No.That's right.Why were Lefferts' eyes black?You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?What little studio?That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.I got her address.Hit the road, gramps.L.A.P.D., shitbird. Get the fuck out of here or I'll call your wife to come get you.Yeah, plain scotch.Are you sorry she's dead?Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?You use words like that, you might make me mad.Yeah I know. Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side. He doesn't want any attention.Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?How'd she meet Patchett?Tell me about Patchett.You want some advice, Miss Bracken?Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.Maybe I'm just fucking curious.You fuck for money.Yeah.When they deserve it.I'm not sure.Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.You look better than Veronica Lake.

Where's the girl?WHERE?!Give me one minute.Get her to the fucking hospital.Get the fuck away from me.It'll look like justice. That's what that fat fuck got. Justice.It's Bud.Who was that guy who was here earlier?When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother. I guess I got in the way.Yeah. But not for long.I used to. What I do now is strong-arm. Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it. If I could work Homicide like a real detective...There's something wrong with the Nite Owl. That prick Exley shot the wrong guys. But they made him a hero and whoever killed my partner is still out there.In here I know it. But I can't prove it. I'm not a detective. I'm not smart enough. I'm just the guy they bring in to scare the other guy shitless.That simple, huh?I got a few Nite Owl questions.I'm tying up loose ends. Padding my report. You know how it goes.Anything off. Anything that didn't make sense.Whose shoe?If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way. What are these smears in the blood?But she's moving away from the door. Who was sitting at this table?Ear plugs.It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D. I'd like to ask a couple of questions.Five minutes. That's all.Tell me about the boyfriend she had. The one you mentioned at the morgue.Ma'am, I'm sure she was.What was that boyfriend's name?Stens? Was it Stens?Look at a picture for me.You said a neighbor heard a ruckus. Was it outside, inside?What's through here?Easy. Tell me about the ruckus.Buzz Meeks... Holy shit.Yeah. A great big one.Here.

He works for a guy named Patchett.His file listed you as a known associate. Now spill.More.How 'bout I give you your balls back?Bullshit. Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?He's under a tract house in San Berdoo. And he don't smell too good. What happened to the heroin, Johnny?What work?You lost me, Dudley. I don't know what you're talking about.Sure, boss. Sure you can.Did you talk to Exley?I want to know about Exley.How'd you get to know so much about him?You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?So tell me about it.No. Now. You fucked him.Lynn.I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other. Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve. The night I met Lynn. Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.Then something goes wrong. Meeks gets killed. Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house. The night he died, Stens was all mysterious. Said he had something big going down.Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.Dudley.Dudley's guys.It all keeps coming back to Dudley.Let's just kill them.For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart. A detective. But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.There are no rules! Why the fuck are you doing this? The Nite Owl made you. You want to tear all that down.Which one are you and which one am I?Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.Come on.He had help getting up there. Two of his fingers are broken.At least not anymore.Lynn.Call him.What about him?Dudley Smith. Spill.If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow. They just won't come on the bus, that's all.They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers. What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room? Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.You do it. I'll check the files.I want to see them.What?You wanted to meet here?Too late.Here.A lot of bad stuff happened here.

Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --That fucking Larry. I almost believed him.Nothing, Ray.

You were seen burning them. Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.Were you on hop? You were passed out when you got arrested. Were you hopped up, Ray?Where do they get their stuff? Come on. Give me one to feed the D.A. Just a little one.I'm going to take a break.You know, Ray, I'm talking about the gas chamber and you haven't even asked me what this is all about. You got a big guilty sign around your neck.Fontaine next, but give Jones the newspaper. I want him primed.Larry, Ray Coates ratted you off. He said the Nite Owl was your idea. You want to tell me about it?I think it was Ray's idea. Talk and I think I can save your life.Larry, this is a gas chamber job. If you don't talk, you'll be dead in six months.Son, six people are dead and somebody has to pay. It can be you or it can be Ray.Larry, he called you queer. He said at Casitas you took it up the ass. He said --Why'd you burn the clothes?Hurt who? Was she a hooker? Hurt who?She may still be alive, whoever she is.Where's the girl? Did you kill her?You wanted Larry to lose his cherry, but things got out of hand. Is that right?Kick loose, Jones. I know you made her bleed, but that doesn't mean you killed her.If that girl's alive, you've still got a chance on this one.You think?Where is she now? Did you leave her someplace? Did you sell her out? Give her to some of your buddies? Tell me where the girl is!Officer White, put down that weapon and --A naked guy with a gun? You expect anyone to believe that?How's it going to look on your report?You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard.'Give me one to feed the D.A.... Roland Navarette. Lives on Bunker Hill. Runs a hole-up for parole absconders.'Anyone seen Jack Vincennes?Nobody move!I need the girl to give me a chronology of events. No details. Just times.But --No. that won't be necessary.There are loose ends out there, Dudley. I --Something's wrong. I feel it inside. Doesn't that sound crazy?Clean?Until he gunned down six people.Then who phoned in the report?The Nite Owl. Anything bothering you about the case?What are you talking about?Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.Officer White?Under the house.I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.I need an I.D. ASAP. You talk only to me on this one.I need to speak to you.I want you to follow Bud White.It's not a request. I need to know what White knows. Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.' Permanently.Yesterday yes, today no. What happened last night?You make a mistake?Listen, I think I made a mistake, too.Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?It's a simple question.Rollo Tomasi.Rollo was a purse snatcher. My father ran into him off duty. He shot my father six times and got away clean. No one even knew who he was. I made the name up to give him some personality.Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it. It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo. But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.I want to do it right.A third. I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.What's that for?Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?What's Fleur-de-Lis?Yeah. But first I want to brace Stompanato.Check the bar. I got the restaurant.Since when do two-bit hoods and hookers give out autographs?L.A.P.D. Sit down.Take a walk, honey, before I haul your ass downtown.Shut up. Being cut to look like Lana Turner doesn't mean you are Lana Turner.What?How was I supposed to know?Bud White's been here?Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?What's her name?Why's she seeing Bud White?Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?Not good enough.This is Exley.Tell him Sergeant Vincennes is coming in to talk to him.I'm going to Lynn Bracken's. I'll meet you at the Dining Car.Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.Really? What did White say?Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he? He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results. But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.Scotch.Why?Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.How was I?You sound like you mean it.How about White?I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?I'll take your word for it.I don't hate White. I really don't. It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.You cut to the heart of things, don't you? What about Lynn Bracken? She going to be a hooker all her life?Some reality.Why not?You're the first person to ever call me tough.You, me and White, huh?No... Where'd the tip come from?I want to know what you and Jack Vincennes talked about last night. Anything and everything. Start with the I.D. on the corpse.We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl. Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.Anything?So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.Where are the police academy files?Just show me where they are!Why?She told you?Who told you? Did Dudley have anything to do with you finding out?Listen to me. Dudley killed Jack. It has something to do with Buzz Meeks.Look. Dudley and Meeks go way back. Stensland, too.Think, goddamn you. Think...Stensland and Meeks. What were they up to?Stensland and Buzz Meeks. Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants. When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.The Nite Owl! Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.It wasn't the Negroes. The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.What?Stay smart, Bud. We build a case. We play by the rules.With a wrecking ball. You want to help me swing it?Let's go see Pierce Patchett. Run a good-cop-bad-cop.You expecting problems?What?I don't think his ex-cop did him much good.It's a suicide note. Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.We had one thing figured wrong. I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.Patchett's dead. He sent you after me. I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.I got a guy who owes me in the Sheriff's department. West Hollywood station. He can be at her house in two minutes.Is she inside?Hold her as Joan Smith. No one sees her unless I okay it.Ellis Loew.Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.Ask for Captain Dudley Smith. We'll have a party. Hot dogs and sauerkraut.I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.None. Call it a hunch.Without what, his smearing yours first? What's he got on you, Loew? Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?The proof had his throat slit. So far you're not denying it.I don't know how.Bud...What's Dudley's scheme?Not everybody. You tip-off Dudley and Officer White visits you alone next time.We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.You want to talk to her?Forget everything else for a second, Lynn. Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?A police captain. I think he's behind all of this.Okay. Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.I don't know if it's pathetic or romantic, but when this is all over I'd like to see you again.Me? You called it. I got a message that...Shit... Come on.You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.We got him!I'm thinking we might walk away from this.Tell that to Jack Vincennes. To Stensland.Why?And now you'll provide them.No.Something like that.Yes. I do.That's it. That's the whole story.I tried to throw it all away and they give it back in spades.Where will you go?When?Where is he?Thanks for the push.You just did what you did. No rank, no glory.From me to you. It'll mean something if it's yours.Do you think I ever could've been in the running?", "clean_line": "sheet decorated idea got description solving crimes require absolute justice youngest applicant
