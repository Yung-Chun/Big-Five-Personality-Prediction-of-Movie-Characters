{"Freddy-vs-Jason": {"MEAGAN": {"raw_line": "Lizzy?Lizzy. What are you doing here?Your friend?I scared him?Lizzy?Jesse!Freddy...Wake up, sleepy head. Time to wake up.Me, too.Don't worry... they can't hurt you.Promise.I'll never let anyone hurt you.Morning.Mom! Don't call it that!That's Jesse. Let's go, Lizzy.I need an alarm clock.Broke.My mom...I had another dream last night...No. You were Jason.Yes, ma'am?Yes... I'm ready.My report is on Global Economic Trends. Try and think of a world where there is no poverty... no sickness... no crime. A world where everyone is happy to be alive and everyone lives together in peace. This is my dream.This dream is becoming a reality with ever-growing international business...Jesse... please, help me.Sure...I was day dreaming and then I woke up but then it was like I was still dreaming and then I woke up and then I guess I fainted and now I'm awake again...I'm waiting to see if you're going to turn into Freddy.But this one was different... it felt real.Fear is real though, isn't it? And if nightmares are fear, then doesn't that make them real?! And if the nightmares are real then is reality like a dream?!Old witch... what does she know? She isn't even qualified to give a shot and she's telling me that my dreams aren't anything to worry about.Oh, sure... Madame Curie in there says it's just a case of heat pro- stration and an overdose of TV news. Ruined my makeup, too.No. She gave me last period off.Jesse! I've been having nightmares for almost two weeks now and they keep getting worse! Now I'm having daymares! I want to know why!You don't understand... I want to know more about dreams. What they mean... why we have them.That's a good idea. Why don't you cut last period and come with me?The library.Find anything?Did you know that our sub-conscious retains everything that ever happened to us? Everything. From the time we're born until we die.That's how Freddy gets at us... by using our sub-conscious fears. Fears our conscious minds have repressed or forgotten.I'm not so sure... if Freddy exists in our sub-conscious then he can never be fully erased. Like a bad memory... you may blot it out of your mind but it will alway be hiding someplace in your dreams. Weren't you scared as a child by something so stupid that you're ashamed to admit it?No?Well, what? What is it?Black Bart.Duh. You put your quarter in and he says, \"Go ahead and draw, tenderfoot.\" And then you pull your gun out and shoot him.No one can hit him -- it's a gyp.I remember... Lizzy wandered off one day and we couldn't find her. The police came and everything. I wasn't really worried until I saw her picture on TV... then I got really scared. Jesse, I can't explain it... but I think something bad's going to happen.What message?The library.Dad... what's wrong? What's happened? Where's Lizzy?Oh, my God...No... no, she wouldn't do that! Lizzy wouldn't join Freddy's cult!Over to Stormie's.That was her \"klepto\" phase... when she was dating that gang member. She dumped him a long time ago.She used to be in the Freddy cult. Maybe she knows where they took Lizzy.That guy in my dreams...I think he thinks Lizzy joined the cult or something.I've got to find Lizzy myself. I've got to find her and save her from Freddy before that crazy cop kills her.Murdoch said something about going to talk to somebody named Erwin.Where is he?I want you to stay here.Don't be mad... it's just that you might scare him.Just stay here... okay?Erwin...?Shoot?I don't do drugs.No.Freddy's cult kidnapped my sister.Tell me... please.Then tell me why they took her...How can he do that?So the cult gets Lizzy pregnant?Erwin... you've got to help me find Lizzy. You're my only hope.Anything. Just name it.How can you kill a dream?Deal.Come on, Jesse! Please...?No! They'll never believe her!They'll never believe that. Come on, Jesse... for me?We've got to do something!Oh, my God -- she was here! This is part of Lizzy's shirt! It's all torn! Erwin... we've got to find her!Except what?!How?Okay... let's do it!What should we do?What are they for?Daddy?He got away... I had him and he got away. Oh, God... Lizzy... I lost her...No... I'm not dead... No... I'm not. But Freddy killed me!Now that I think about it -- he's killed me in all my nightmares. But I'm not dead... what does it mean?But we've still got a chance, right? A chance to kill Freddy before he gets back his power?Then let's get somebody else. Some- body strong.Jason...Jason Voorhees...Erwin... I'm trusting you on this, so tell me the truth. Do you think if we do this -- if we go and get Jason and bring him back to life, that he could kill Freddy?I haven't got a choice. I've got to try something... I can't ask either of you to help me do this... it's illegal, immoral, disgusting...You don't have to, Jesse... it's not your fight. I understand.We should pull over and ask directions.It says, open all night.We're looking for the old cemetery that's supposed to be around here... somewhere.Well, we're just doing an article for our high school newspaper about the dangers of breaking into cemeteries at night. You know, stuff that can get you hurt...What's the story on Jason Voorhees anyway?I knew that. What I mean was why?What happened to him then?Why does he keep coming back to life and killing people?I'm exhausted... wake me when we get back home.I know! We'll sing a song! Row! Row! Row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily... life is but a dream. Come on, everybody!...merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily... life is but a dream.It's Freddy!Jesse's hurt real bad... we've got to get him to a doctor.Oh, God... Jesse...Go... get out of here. Take Jason and Stormie with you.Is he going to be okay?Jesse!Jesse! Wake up! Wake up!!Jesse, wake up! WAKE UP!!Freddy killed Jesse...Jesse...I know where we can get a heart... A good one.Do you think you and Stormie could keep him occupied for a few minutes?Okay... let's do it.Forgive me, Jesse...He didn't want to come with us... but he did anyway. He did it for me.I just can't believe he's dead. I keep thinking he'll show up any minute...It's kill him! Shut it off! Shut it off!Jason! JASON! You've got to get up! Do you hear me? Get up!Who are you calling?!Are you kidding?! They'll lock us up and throw away the key!STOP!Now... just stop! We're the ones that brought you back to life. And you have no right to kill us with that chainsaw! In fact... you owe us...That's right.Look! Here's his picture...Now, I know that you've been through a lot. And I know that you're pissed off about being murdered and all.But if you help us kill Freddy Krueger... I promise to help you find the little bastard that killed you. What do you say? Have we got a deal?Jason, you have to hide! Stay in here and don't come out until we tell you. Stormie... help me!We've got to try and stay awake.What am I going to do? I'll never be able to find Lizzy now.I bet you're sorry you came with me now...That's for being my best friend, Stormie.Where are we going?I'm okay, mom.Sorry. Today has been a bitch.A mental hospital.There's no mistake. What did you do with Erwin?We're wasting time! We've got to close down all the churches -- Freddy has to marry Lizzy on holy ground!Don't you understand?! He has to come to our reality to do it! It's our last chance to kill him!Dad! Mom! Don't let them lock me up! I have to save Lizzy!I did what I had to do to try and save Lizzy!Liar! Freddy killed Jesse! He was already dead when I cut his heart out!Goddamnit, you don't understand! Freddy lives! FREDDY LIVES!!!Stormie?!Oh, God... what have I done? What have I done?!Something just happened at the TV station.What for?I like you... sure. It's just that I usually shower alone, that's all.Wait a second... I didn't mean to do that... I'm sorry. It's just that you come on a little strong, that's all. Just give me a little time to adjust to my new surroundings...Yes... I want you.Meagan.Oh, my friend...Yeah... they said she had some disease that made her... explode! Oh, God! Please hold me!Oh... well... the cops? Well, they think I gave it to her...Stop!Take me, Freddy. Take me instead.Oh, that's right -- tell everybody!Kick his ass, Jason!Jason! Get up! Get up!Jason! You've got to get up!What took you so long?!I knew you would come...Erwin? Erwin?!NO!No monsters here.Then we'll just have to kick their ass again.I love you too.

I love Lizzy. No telling what those freaks will do to her. Those Freddy cult guys are hard core.I was in the cult for a week cause my boyfriend at the time... Slasher, he was. But I just liked the music and the clothes... when they were clean, but not like the violence and stuff. But that was just my \"cult\" phase... but I got past that. You know, just like my \"gang\" phase when I was dating Ramon and then before that was my \"death rock\" phase when I was dating Stuart...Militant feminist, man-hating phase, what's it fuckin' to ya?!Jason kicked his ass.Well, one of my mom's boyfriends worked at the hospital where they took him. He said that Murdoch lost more than half his brain and what little that was left was all twisted up inside. And they had to replace his skull with a metal plate to keep that from leaking out.One thing... he used to be a Democrat. Now he votes straight Republican.Oh, my God... he'll kill her.Erwin Kelper! He used to be in the Freddy cult! I bet he knows where they took Lizzy!Who else? Erwin is scary smart -- always brought home \"A\"s -- but he was kinda fucked up, too... I mean, who isn't really? Anyway, he quit the cult a few months back and the cops put him away for his own safety. They say Freddy's put a death hex on Erwin.Yes, a death hex. You know... where someone wants you dead!What she's subtly trying to tell you is that this needs a woman's gentle touch... butthead.He's talking about dream dope -- the stuff the cultists shoot up with so they can talk to Freddy.Chill, Erwin. We're here for some hard data -- not a floppy disk.I told her you might know where they took her.The whole cult? Yeech!That's the stupidest shit I ever heard.But Freddy's dead.Come on, Meagan... our five minutes is up. He's giving me the creeps.How will they ever know? Don't be such a pussy!Okay, I will!I can disguise my voice... Hello, how do you do? My name is Jesse. I think I'm a man but I'm actually a wimp.Oh, cool!Whatever... Put 'em on -- they're really cool!I've got him! Wake us up! Wake us up!Don't just stand there! Wake us up!Shoot him! Shoot him!You didn't help me, you pussy! I could've had him! You gutless... spinless... jelly fish!Are you okay?He killed me, too. But look...Yeah! We could hire somebody to kill Freddy -- like a hit man!Sounds like our man!Well, that's okay... as long as he doesn't chop us all up.Hey, we sisters have to stand together, right? Where you lead -- I'll follow. Count me in.If it doesn't offend the men... ooops, sorry! There aren't any.I don't think they're open.I don't think there's anybody here...We want to see it.Been dug up a few times already, has he?Where have you been? Jason was that guy who ran around in a hockey mask, chopping up camp counselors, duh?She got her head chopped off by one of the girls she was trying to kill!Get back, you nasty-ass bastard! Ug! I thought I had seen the last of those when my brother graduated third grade!Well, that means we've all got to stay awake!I'm staying with you.How?Hey doc, is there someplace I could get us something to eat?I'll be right back... I'm goin' go score us some munchies.Jesus... get a grip, lady. You'd think a nurse in a hospital would have seen a dead body before.This is Stormie...Just missed 'em.Where'd you get the truck?And where's that?What'd you do -- take him for a swim?I don't know. She's pretty fucked up. God, I don't know why I'm not...What's that supposed to mean?Is this him?Why'd you put that stupid mask on him?Good idea.So what do we do now -- sing an Ozzy Osbourne song backwards or something?I thought you said you knew how to bring him back to life?Awwww, he won't be needing that... I mean, what girl would let him put his rotten ol'...Well... does it really matter? Can't you use an aquarium pump or something?Hey! Watch that!Just keep your hands above the bra, pizza face.He's head right for her! Do some- thing!You've got to quit blaming your- self for what happened to Jesse... it wasn't your fault.I'm not sorry I came... I don't think Jesse would be, either.So you kick the bucket and Jason lives.Just don't stand there! Do something!The cops! Who else?!Fine by me! Damnit! It's dead!You're the one who brought him back to life!Well, do something!Oh, some hero!That's right! She gave you her boyfriend's heart, you know!I know I would be!Getting something to eat might help. Yo, Butch!Excuse me, Deputy Miller but could we have something to eat?And I thought you pigs only ate donuts.Cow! I hope she chokes on her three combo-burrito cud!You should be worrying about your- self... I know I am.Nah... what are best friends for? Afterall, you stuck by me through all my crazy phases, I figure I owe you one big crazy phase, right?Help! Help! Freddy's here! He's here!Oh, shit! I'm still asleep!You don't scare me, Freddy! Thanks to my various phases and many hours of watching violent televison, I have become immune to violence. Seen it all and done it all!

YOUR ARMS!Where do you shoot?You're not in the cult?Didn't Freddy send you to kill me?I don't trust you... better take off your clothes so I can check you for tracks.Well, what do you want? Can't you see I'm busy?I already told the cops everything I know.Look... I'm sorry about your sister, but I've got my own problems with Freddy. I'm a marked man, you know.To bear his child. Freddy wants to be human again. In order to do that he has to be \"reborn\".He has to marry a virgin on holy ground. Then the cult consumate the marriage by impregnating her.Freddy's the son of a hundred maniacs. It's sort of a tradition with him.And Freddy enters the soul of the fetus through a dream state. Voila! Rebirth.Hey, they're not my rules... some- body else wrote 'em.I'll help you find your sister, but you've got to help me.You have to help me kill Freddy.Freddy lives... If only in our dreams.When it's not a dream. Do we have a deal?Hi, my name's Erwin. Thanks for busting me out of there!Damn! We must have just missed them!We're too late! There's no way... except...We could go after Freddy.We'll inject ourselves with Dream Dope. It's a mild narcotic that brings on a dreamlike state.Don't worry about it. We need you wide awake anyway.We're going to go under and try to find Freddy. When we do, we'll grab him and bring him here. Then you kill him with this...It's not the gun, it's what's in it -- silver bullets blessed by a priest.Should. But then...Have a seat over there and make yourselves comfortable. Roll up your sleeves and put these on...It's how the cult keeps in constant contact with Freddy. The little lights flashing are a sustained occular input that causes your brain to resonate at approximately the same frequency at which the dream state is most likely to occur.It helps to hold hands if you want to go together...And remember... Freddy knows what scares you.WHAT A RUSH, HUH?!!Freddy's trying to split us up...Well, atleast you're not dead.It means we've still got some time left. Until his remains are host to the Dream Demons -- Freddy can't hurt us.Freddy made a pact with Satan when he died... so Satan bestowed upon him the Dream Demons. They're the source of Freddy's power to manipulate our physical reality. Without them... he's powerless -- nothing more than a bad dream. Hey, like I said... I don't make the rules.We already tried that. There's no way for us to kill Freddy. He's too clever. He knows how to get to us.You would have to hire a thousand of them... or one really big guy who isn't afraid of anything. No fear. Nada. Then you got a shot.Jason Voorhees... that's brilliant! The perfect dream warrior... no fear.Seriously dead. Buried up by Crystal Lake somewhere. But don't worry, I know how to bring him back to life.But that's not the problem. The problem is control. Once we bring Jason back from the dead... I'm not one hundred percent sure he'll do what we tell him.No doubt about. Jason could wreck Freddy on this side of the Dreamline. But if Freddy has home court advan- tage... I don't know. Too close to call. The trick would be to get Jason to enter a dream state, grab Freddy, and drag him out to our reality.That's about the size of it... and I'd be doing you a disservice if I said there weren't a modicum of risk involved.Look out Freddy... here we come.It started a long time ago, back in the fifties, when Jason drown at Camp Crystal Lake. His mother went berserk and started killing the counselors.Right. And then Jason came back from his watery grave to get revenge.Yeah. Chopped up a number of people before they finally caught up to him.They killed him.Not very well apparently. Jason keeps coming back to life and chopping people up. It's a never ending cycle of terror up here at Crystal Lake -- a real problem.They say he's looking for revenge on the camp counselor who murdered him as a child. Jason just happens to go about it in the socially unacceptable way of hacking through every teenager he finds until he gets the right one. Here it is...Look... the boogerman! Get it?!We just dug up a rotting corpse and you're worried about a little snot.Uhhh... better not fall asleep -- we've still got a lot of work to do and Freddy's out there... waiting.Don't worry... an ambulance is on the way.Meagan... listen to me... The cops are on their way. If they find me and Jason Voorhees in the trunk there, we're finished.I'll call you at the hospital.Somehow!Same place I've got Jason hid.A place where no one ever goes.Almost.Is she going to be alright?You're a strong woman.Uhhh... nothing. I didn't mean anything.Yeah... Meet the new and improved Jason.Take a look...Not exactly a beauty queen entry, is he?I'm afraid it's not that simple...I do! But when I was putting him back together, I noticed something was missing.No-no! Not that! It's his heart... it's missing.No... he has to have a heart. A human heart. A good one.That guard in there might pose a problem.I'm just trying to make it look real.Well, that just about does it...As you can see, I've excavated the power cable that runs across the bottom of Crystal Lake. I've cut away the insulation, exposing a patch of cable right near the water's edge.Now when I kick this over, the water will wash down the trench and bridge an eletrical gap between the cable and the lake. There's plenty of voltage, so it should work.Yeah, right... Okay, keep your fingers crossed...Holy shit! It worked!Shut it off... it suddenly occurs to me that I hadn't really planned for that contingency.Well... it's off now.Hey! Come back! I've got him locked up in the tool shed!He's right behind me!And?!There's no one else inside.You... want me to tell you where Meagan is?Well why didn't you say so?! Jesus, for a minute there I thought you were going to kill me. You're not, are you?Okay... okay! I'll take you right to her. Could you help me out of this?I'll drive.Okay... you drive.Fuck the bitch. Let's roll!That was easy enough...I can't wake them up. Freddy's got them trapped!Go get him, boy!What ever you do... don't let this guy drive.Oh, no! Freddy's in the transmitter!He's going for the satellite dish! If he uplinks with a communications satellite he can beam himself any- where in the world! We'll never be rid of him!No!
