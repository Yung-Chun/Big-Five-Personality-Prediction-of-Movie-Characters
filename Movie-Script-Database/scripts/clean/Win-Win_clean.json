That's why we brought Jolie into help you, right?Well if that Judge deems you incapacitated then you will need a guardian.

You find his daughter?Crap.They could but they never will. It's too much work. They'll probably move him into Oak Knoll. Hand me one of their brochures?No, she can't.

Leo hold on! Can you stop him, please?Oh..no, Your Honor. I have the two certified letters returned unclaimed. And there is no phone number for her. We can't find her.Yes, your Honor, she is. But Mr. Poplar hasn't seen her for over twenty years.Your daughter.OK.Your Honor, if it pleases the Court.I would be willing to serve as Mr. Poplar's guardian.Yeah.More like five.May I approach, your honor?Well Judge, I think I'd be a better candidate then the state in this case. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 20Yeah, and stop saying really, it's annoying.And, as his lawyer, I feel like I'm in a better position to execute what my client wants.Your Honor, Leo told me he wants to live at home. He has the money to do that and I want to make sure that happens. If the State can do that then fine.Mr. Poplar wants to live at home.Yes, I can. Really.Yeah. I think so.No. We're not, Leo. I'm gonna help you get settled into a new place to live right here in town.I know. But I need you to stay in this new place for a while. It's nice. You'll like it.Yeah, that's what he said.OK. OK. I just have to make one stop first.I have to swing by a client's house and shut off the water.Because it's freezing and I don't want his pipes to burst.What? Oh, because I'm his guardian.Jack, he's in Oak Knoll. They do everything. I just have to check in on him from time to time.He does. It comes out of his estate and he can afford it.

He's at Oak Knoll. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 29Me.How did the visit go?Yeah. Your grandfather is in the early stages of dementia, Kyle. So sometimes he does things and says things that don't make sense.I'm his guardian.It means I make sure he's well taken care of.What are you doing?There's not even a bathroom down there.Sure thing, Leo.We should go, Kyle.Here's fifty bucks in case you need it.Actually it's only forty-three but take it. You never know.Well, good luck, Kyle.Hello? Yes, it is. Yes. OK. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 33OK. Thanks. I'll be right down.It was the police.

Adopt him?Honey, I know it's tough but we're not in a position to take care of another kid right now.Then we don't have to do this.I know. I know. You're right.Come on.OK.I know. I'm just not sure that beating the crap out of everybody is the best solution.Now?I can't. Not until we figure what's going on back there.No. Not yet. Jack's left her about thirty messages.What? Who?Where are you? Are you watching Lori's house again?He's sitting in my waiting room. Jackie made me take him with me.No. What does that mean?Yeah, well...Let me call you back.Jesus. Can I talk to her?Who knows?Yeah.Uh...yeah...OK. You know where it is?OK, yeah. Just stay there and I'll pick you up at about three.Hey, Rew, what are you doing? Coach, can you get on Pill.Everyone watch because none of you are doing it right. You want to put your chest into his side.Just slide back a bit, Vig. A bit more. Yeah. Right there. Then you give him your full weight. Go ahead Vig.Then you ride the crotch and break him down with a cross-face.Hey! We're trying to teach you guys something and you're all just goofing off. Shut up!Last time I checked we haven't won a match! Right coach?! 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 41It's embarrassing. But you're all acting like you don't care! Well, I'm not getting paid enough to just jerk around here. I don't know about you?I care about what I do and so should you!So does coach Vig, and so should you! Run em, Coach. I can't look at them anymore!Uh...yeah I did but Terry said he'd help and I think we can...Uh...yeah but just for a half hour.Yeah, if you want. Sure. And by the way, what I did in there today, yelling like that. I don't usually do that.Don't worry about it. You ever wrestle before?Hey Vig. Alright, guys, listen up! Kyle's going to be working out with us for a little while.Time. Switch. And...wrestle! 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 44You have fun?When's the last time you wrestled?Why'd you stop?So let me ask you something, Kyle.

He finished second at the states. In Ohio!I know. It's nuts. And he quit after his freshman year.I don't know. He doesn't talk much. He's kind of a weird kid. Why can't I have one kid like that on my team? Just one. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 46He's not on the team, Ter. He's not even a student. He's been here for three days.I'm not enrolling him. He's just here until we reach his mother and figure this out.I'm not just helping out the old man, Ter. It's not like it's charity work. I'm getting paid for it.Wow. He's gonna throw him. Look, he's setting him up. He's setting him up!OK. Let's go, pal.Why not? Whether he's here for two more days or two weeks it gives him something to do all day. Unless you want him hanging out here?Right. I'll take that.No. It's not a legal fee. It's a personal fee.Oh, I ended up taking on Leo's guardianship.Yeah, I thought I mentioned that to you.Yeah, well, it just played out that way. I have to get going.Uh..not this time. Next month. Promise.I know. Bye Shelly.Hey honey. I'm good. Could you do me a favor and drop that health insurance check in the mail? I just forgot to mail it. Yeah, it's on my desk. Thanks. I'll call you later.Hey. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 50What are you doing here?We're trying to figure out where he can wrestle?No. Not right.Hey Kyle. Come on in. How was school?This is my friend Terry.How the shoe's fit?So let me ask you something, Kyle. You think you might want to wrestle in a match?Great. We have a match on Saturday. What do you wrestle?Yeah. Jimmy Reed. But I think he might be better off at 125.Vig, you keep time? 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 52I gotta stop by the office and deal with the computer. Should I...?He'd kill us. Both of us. Together.Man strength?Yeah...I wouldn't say that around the locker room.Trying to figure out what's wrong with my fricking back-up system.I don't have an IT guy. IT guys cost money.Seriously? 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 55How are you value added?Yeah, but Ter, you sucked.Yeah, that's not really value added.We start at 3:30pm. Don't be late.Just a singlet. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 56Yeah, so we can see your man strength.If it is, she just ran away.Were you outside?It's pretty early. You do this every morning?Oh. Wow.It was Kyle.Working out.In season. Yeah.I know.Vig is leading by example. Winners never quit.Guys. I don't think we should fight about our seats in front of the kids. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 60OK. You ready?This kid is good. So just...you know...be ready out there.What?Uh, OK.Ter! Cut the shit! You're a coach. You're not sitting in the stands.It's his first match. Give him a break.Hey! You OK?Yeah. I think he did.How'd that feel? Pretty good?You ready?No, honey. It's almost bed time.Alright. I want to spend this week working on bottom position. Did you all see Kyle the other day? He exploded up. Kyle, show the guys what you did.So can you share it with us? 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 65You bring the tape?Yeah. Of course. What?No. That's true, pal.Well because they can take good care of him there, Kyle.I know, pal. Hang on a minute. Hello? Yes. This is him.Oh. Can you hang for a moment? Hey, I have to take this. I'll be right in, OK? We can talk in a minute.Hi. Sorry to keep you waiting. Yeah. How are you doing?Yeah, well I think she heard that I'm a lawyer and I have a family and that was good enough.Another month, I guess, until she gets out of rehab. She said that Craig guy took off. She sounded pretty shaky. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 68Yeah. I know. Where is he anyway?Yes, it is. So what do we do?I guess we don't.OK. This is Kenny Randall. He's very good.But you have an advantage here, he has no idea who you are, right? 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 70So he's gonna be overconfident. You take advantage of that and when you get your shot, put him away.See how he runs out there? I want that kind of intensity from all of you.Really? Korsic will be happy. Tell him now so he doesn't puke.What's up, guys?You do?Where you gonna wrestle? 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 75Huh. Vig?No. It's gonna be fine.Hook the arm! Carlos, hook the arm!How we doing?Come here, Stemler.You've been practicing for a long time. You're ready for this. You hear me?If you get in trouble out there, you just listen to me. I'm right here, OK?OK. You are not going to get pinned! You hear me! No way!Good. Now I'm going to slap you. Ready?Keep moving, Stemler. Keep working!Shit. Really?Fuck this!Stemler! Stemler!!You need to get up! He's trying to drown you! He wants you dead. But you are not going to die on the bottom! Do you hear me? Do you?!Good! Now just do the move we worked on in practice.\"Whatever the fuck it takes!\"Hey, I'm proud of what you did today. That win meant a lot to the guys.Let me ask you something. What's it like? Being as good as you are? What's it feel like?Yeah, I do. Must be nice.Yeah.How is he?Honey. Can you stop, please?Yeah. I am. If you don't punch her first.It's a cab. It's her.Yeah, it is. That will be your fault.Hi. I'm Mike Flaherty. Come in, please.And this is my wife, Jackie and my daughter, Stella.Can I get you a drink or something?Water or soda or anything?Right. OK. So I'll go get Kyle.Oh, he's doing really well. He's going to the high school here and he's wrestling on the team actually.Hi, honey. This is Abby.Abby, can you go get Kyle for us?He left? What do you mean?I'm really sorry about this.You know Kyle's doing really well with wrestling here, Cindy. The regions are this weekend and if he wins there then he goes to the states.Yeah. It is and it could be really good for him. It might even mean a scholarship. Anyway, I was wondering if you could stay here for another three weeks until that's all over. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 85Uhh...yeah. We could probably make that work.OK. Good. That's great.Hey.Really? We found him.Yeah, OK. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 86Great, Ter. Thanks. Bye. He went to my friend's house. We can go get him.You sure?OK. I'll drop you off.I'm afraid so, pal. She's staying so you can finish the season. That's pretty nice of her.I told her you'd go see her today, Kyle.Where ever you want. She could come here or we could go see her at Leo's house. She moving in this morning.Yeah, that's OK but Kyle but you have to promise me...Hi Betty. How's the foot?Really? Did she say why?Hi Cindy. Hi, I'm Mike Flaherty. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 88Please come in.I wasn't aware that Cindy was represented by council.Last week? I thought she just arrived two days ago. How long have you been here?So how can I help?What kind of a role is that?Really? So you want to move here?Well I'm not sure that's what Leo wants.I understand that, Cindy. But you haven't seen Leo in a long time and he's battling dementia now so it puts me in a tough position here.I understand that.So do I and I'm sure we can. Now, I'm sorry, but I actually have to go see a client so we'll have to set up another time to discuss this.Yeah. Of course. After school.Yeah, it's that bad.I can't.I just can't go back in front of Judge Lee, it won't look good, trust me.She's the only Judge who handles these cases and if I look bad in front of her right now, I'm screwed. I'll have to close my fricking doors.Yeah, I do.Hey, pal.Yeah. She just told me today.I don't know Kyle. It's complicated.OK. OK. Look, just go get ready for practice and I'll deal with it.I have no idea. I have no freaking idea!What the hell does that mean?No, I can't do that. She's not even in his...That's right. She's not and she doesn't and that's my play.Don't worry about it. I just need to make a call. Can you get practice started?No. I really don't.Look, we're all concerned with what's best for Leo so I'm hoping we can settle this in an amicable way.Good, well, I thought I'd start by laying all the cards on the table, so maybe you can understand why I'm hesitating in turning Leo over to Cindy. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 93Cindy, your father disinherited you from his will. Completely. And I'm afraid that can't change now that he's been declared incapacitated.Yeah. I actually brought you a copy.No.No. He left everything to the municipal parks system.
