{"House-of-1000-Corpses": {"JERRY": {"raw_line": "Alright then, out of all of Charlie's chicks who do you think is the hottest?Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.She's pretty cute.There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, \"do you smoke?\" The guy say, \"yeah\"... the devil say, \"great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had.\"Then the devil asks, \"do you drink?\" Guy says, \"yeah\"... devil say, \"wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff.\"Then the devil says, \"are you gay?\" Guy says, \"fuck no\"... Devil says, \"Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays.\"Yeah, no shit I just told ya. Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, \"Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy.\"Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign. Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.OK, Boss.Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.Really fucking awesome.Hell yeah.Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.Come on, babe. Me and Bill found a kick ass place.Grab Mary and come inside.You'd be surprised. Would it be OK if we took some pictures and included this place in our book?You got some really rare stuff here... ...dig your Feegee mermaid.Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.Aw, come on. It will be fun.I'm gonna go ask him.Shit, it is only sprinkling and it's worth the trouble. Hold on for two seconds.I know it's hard to understand, but I really want to see this tree.Great.We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.Fried chicken. Anybody want some?Keep straight on this road here.I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.It's a hitchhiker.Hey, maybe she knows where this is?Cat fight, cat fight.Really, that's a long time.Yikes.Hey, you might know... ...you know where this tree is at? It's an old hanging tree from...Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?What?Huh... what cone?I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.Cool.What's that?That reminds me of a film I saw once of a guy who got out of his car at Lion Country Safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions.No... yeah, they ripped him to pieces while his family watched from the car. The wife is screaming, the kids are crying. Some dude in another car filmed the whole thing.The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.What was that?I'll help ya.Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.Well, technically I did what ya said.Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?I'll go. It's my fault.I agree.Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.No problem.Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.It says, \"records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility.\"Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, \"criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946.\"These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.I don't... ...I just thought it was weird.Huh?Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.When?Aw, get over it, she's just some dopey redneck, she ain't smart enough to be up to nothing... I mean anything... chicks.What... what!Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.Dude, your chick's a little high strung.Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.Oh, right.Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary.Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.I don't doubt that.And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.I was just kidding.Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in.Didn't ya think, Mary?Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.Tasted pretty good.I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.Firefly... mmmmm odd name. Mrs. Firefly, do you know anything about the legend of Dr. Satan?But something happened, right? I mean the story is based on a real incident, right?I really want to know.Oh, you mean on TV.Great.This is way too fucked up for words.I know, this is fucking nuts.I don't know, I think he's funny.Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.Shhhhhh.Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?Holy fuck, hurry up.Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.Let us go, please... let the girls go.Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.Please, please this is insane. You can't do this.Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.That was good babe, just keep doing that.Someone is out there... ...help, we're in here!", "clean_line": "alright charlie chicks think hottest huh thought sure lynette fromme got snooty vibe know dig pretty cute kid bodily controls dude jeff baxter puker fucker sit puke talking cute like regular cute leslie van houton cute ain hot far hot goes gotta ruth ann moorehouse fuck yeah join cult best try kill president baggage ain hanging ll let slide seventeen yeah guess hot chicks nuts guy goes hell devil says smoke guy yeah devil great cause tuesday cigar night sweetest cuban cigars devil asks drink guy says yeah devil wonderful wednesday free drinks night best booze finest stuff devil says gay guy says fuck devil says guess gonna hate thursdays yeah shit told ya hey think place called alien ed ufo welcoming center says fact separated fantasy panic way caffeine guy sign captain spaulding museum madmen monsters cool fried chicken gasoline exit hope place cool use interesting liven chapter ok boss holy crap gotta place awesome fucking awesome hell yeah wakey wakey eggs bakey come babe kick ass place grab mary come inside surprised ok took pictures included place book got rare stuff dig feegee mermaid great let paid tickets isn ready museum murder mayhem aw come fun gonna ask shit sprinkling worth trouble hold seconds know hard understand want tree great hit jackpot let roll good buddy got convoy fried chicken anybody want straight road exactly sure looks close pass abandoned school bus come need like real deal far way come hitchhiker hey maybe knows cat fight cat fight long time yikes hey know know tree old hanging tree wow real thing deadwood called cool huh cone hate saying word cheese time picture taken smile cheese cool reminds film saw guy got car lion country safari picture lion cub got eaten lions yeah ripped pieces family watched car wife screaming kids crying dude car filmed thing lions totally covered guy blood think ate face tore open rib cage pulled legs wild scene ll help ya yeah fixed ain um remember think took fit bags forgot technically ya said tire fucking gone crap man saving think straight mean know fact ain way right ll fault agree forget flashlight pretty dark problem hey listen think related dr satan yeah book chapter called self freaks people mutilate order work freak talks tattooed people wild men borneo shit like mention single case woman suspected having arms removed purpose arm wonder says records ellie thompson born normal physical stature lived life normal bearings time placed care willows state mental facility nuthouse age blah blah blah released reappear ellie bogdan arm wonder says criss crossed united states constantly carnivals freak shows death dates perfectly correspond time frame beloved dr satan working looney bin ll bet amputated arms know thought interesting thought weird huh oh blow proportion aw dopey redneck ain smart mean chicks hold hold everybody calm tow truck guy ok lassies think time gripping reality hey nice outfit billy bob dude chick little high strung hey maybe guy tow truck drive phone oh right um jerry denise mary thought maybe hoedown doubt gonna help razor blades candy apples kidding yes thank thank hey waiting cousin itt great thought felt certain attraction mary tiny soon walked ya think mary oh worry offended said got lighten right hey asked wanted chicken tasted pretty good ve meaning ask mrs ummmm firefly mmmmm odd mrs firefly know legend dr satan happened right mean story based real incident right want know oh mean tv great way fucked words know fucking nuts know think funny negative shit deep sticks walk hours zero shhhhhh jesus think gonna cut holy fuck hurry kill kill let let girls let won tell anybody insane think think try open lid try kick hole wood know good babe help"}, "BILL": {"raw_line": "I guess if I had to choose I'd say... mmmmmm...

Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?Yeah, no shit.Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.Hot has got nothing to do with it.Hold on, I've heard this before... but I can't remember the end.Shit, we really need to find some gas.Yeah.Oh yeah, I remember now.I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.Perfect.I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.How awesome?Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?How long have you been running this place?No, really.The Duke?You mean John Wayne?Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions.

Looks like some kind of animal.There's a dog in the road.He won't move.There's not enough room.Hey, he moved.Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.Fuck. I think we blew a tire.OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.Gee, ya think it wouldn't be too much trouble.I hope you fixed the spare like I asked ya.Jesus Christ, Jerry.You're a real fucking piece of work.Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.Fine. I'll go straight.Fine! I'll go straight!Fuck! We are fucked!OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.Forget it.

No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.That's not something to joke about.Hey, great they're back.Mary, I'm sorry but he left without me. Mary... come on, you don't think I'd leave you stranded out there.Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.The yard, what's that?Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.Is that why he wears the mask?Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.Here we go.From a Captain Spaulding down at some museum.What's he so excited about?Just grin and bear it.Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.I can't believe what I'm seeing.Just sit back and enjoy the show.Man, it's already ten thirty.Yeah, I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out.
