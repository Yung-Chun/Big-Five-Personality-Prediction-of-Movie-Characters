I am prepared for the next stage.I've missed you too, father.Heh. Yeah... I mean, yes sensei.Hey.Thanks.Hey little bro! a beat) Mikey? You can let go now... um, Mikey?Just enjoying being home. hey walk past Donnie's Chop Shop room as - BOOM! - something explodes and smoke pours out under his door.Say, what's up with April and Casey? I expected them to drop by after I got back.They're living together now? They get to the living room area. Mikey walks to the edge of a jury-rigged HALF-PIPE he built in an old water slough. Mikey continues as he skates back and forth.Is Casey at least still doing his hockey mask thing?\"Nightwatcher\"? That some new comic book you're hooked on, Mikey? RAPHAEL walks in. Picks up Mikey's scrapbook as he passes the sofa and slugs it in Leo's chest.This guy could bring heat on all of us if he keeps this up. Showboating isn't a replacement for justice... it's just self-indulgence. Someone needs to talk to this thug. ON RAPH - He looks... dying to say something. But can't.Does ANYBODY train anymore?!Ninja tag, topside!Have you been avoiding me? Barely seen you since I got home.I don't know... your brother gets to go on a world-wide training mission and you have to stay home. Might upset me too.I'm just saying, I'd understand if you were upset. Their intensity ESCALATES.Is that what this is about? You think Splinter likes me best?We need to come up with a plan.Raph. Save it for another day.Fact remains, Raph, that we should have never been there in the first place.This is my fault now, Raph? I'm the only one who has to be responsible!Hothead.But Master Splinter, how can I be expected to do so when Ra-Save the brute vigilante junk for that Nightwing guy.Whatever. Raph stands and exits the room. The others stay silent as we-What are you talking about Casey?How do you figure that, Donnie? Donatello looks up with MAGNIFYING GOGGLES on. Sarcastic.Do bad guys still try to do that?Or until we prove Winters is up to something more than collecting art.Raph, that would be the worst idea yet. We hang back. Analyze. Formulate a plan, THEN storm your castle. Are we clear? Tense stare off between Raph and Leo. Raph moves anyway. Casey stops him. Quieter moment.You're playing video games on the possible eve of Armageddon, Mikey.Where's Raph?Nice try, amateur. Leo crosses the busy street while still maintaining his secrecy. Zip lines through power lines, avoids an oncoming bus, and flips back onto a cable. e swings and manages to snag Nightwatcher in mid-leap!Oof! You're a heavy boy, aren't you? They both land on a fire escape, as Night clamors to the top. Leo wastes no time in catching up.Okay, someone's been training pretty hard. It begins to spit rain - and becomes a FRANK MILLER DOWNPOUR.I want you to know that I appreciate your intentions. But you can't change the world like this. INSIDE HELMET - All we hear is rain pouring. Raph can't hear Leo - just sees him wagging his finger at him.What? How did you- ...then he starts goading him on. Pushing Leo. Prodding. Making him MAD. ...and then Leo fights back. HARD. Night can't keep up. Leo uses every bit of his control, restraint and expertise. He surgically slices the bind under Night's helmet. He jumps on top of the vigilante.Goodnight, dark prince. Leo UPPERCUTS Night, knocking his helmet off! His face falls... IT'S RAPHAEL! Leo pales.R-raph?I was training! Training to be a better leader! For you! Why do you hate me for that?!Wh-wh-what took you s-so long? WIDER - Leo is alive. Coughs and slowly gets his strength back. Stands up. He and Raph look at each other. Leo can only imagine what Raph's been through to rescue him. A beat.Come to daddy. MOMENTS LATER - SMASH! - Leo steps out, ready for action. Strapped with a dozen swords tucked all over his body. He pulls them out randomly as needed throughout the fight.They better hurry with that last monster!That's what I'm afraid of. BACK WITH VAN - CLOSE ON CASEY'S FACE - As he's screaming his guts out.I'm in.Passed what?Yeah, we're cool. Our secret, bro. You got rid of the stuff, right?

I'm scared!Dude! They're all around me! What do I do? WHAT DO I DO?! Mikey's eyes continue to panic. DONATELLO's voice comes in over a RADIO. Calming.But I need back up this time, man!Okay - waita-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA!! Suddenly TEN KIDS WITH BIRTHDAY HATS AND FOAM NUNCHUCKS run in SCREAMING and start beating on Mikey... a little too hard.I can only hope they're as lovely as the rugrats you got here. ON KIDS - They look tough, brandishing their nerf weapons - a toddler street gang. One of the kids does a finger-point-then- throat-slit gesture. The mom looks and beams. The kids quickly smile to cover.Such... angels. Mikey looks to the side, and sees the still piled-high stack of PIZZA BOXES through the fake head POV.Hyuk! Cowabunga dudes! Bye!Heheh... score.Yes... sir.All's I'm saying Donnie is that no one would notice if YOU did one of these gigs every now and again.Well, if panache is French for \"punching bag\", I'd have to agree with ya.Aw nuts. Mikey suddenly grips his face back into a tight SMILE, frozen. He looks over and waves at the man who confusingly waves back.Just get me outta here, dude. ON DON - He hits some switches. Monitors change.Honeeeeey! I'm hooome! As Mikey slides down the banister, the cam dollies aroundDomo arigato, dude. Mikey walks into the room and plops down on a sofa. Hits a remote as a BIG SCREEN lights up in front of him. Suddenly-Yes, sensei. ANGLE ON - SPLINTER the Japanese rodent master and father of the TMNT. He is well-kempt, still walks with a cane, and has the same sparkle in his eye. He approaches Mikey. Silent.Sensei? Oh! Here ya go, Master Splinter. Mikey reaches into his bag and removes a foil-wrapped piece of BIRTHDAY CAKE. Splinter lights up.Don, y'ever feel like you were meant for more? To DO more? Like, I mean, sometimes I feel like...Every day it's the same thing. Wake up. Birthday party gig. Drive home. Watch TV. Train... Rinse. Repeat.Now THAT'S what I'm talking about! Cruising the streets, busting those who hold themselves above the law. But they aren't above HIS. Don walks in, holding an in-process invention. He looks up.I think he's COOL.Keeya! HATCHAAAAAA!!But I don't WANNA pop out of the birthday cake, Mrs. Ro-Leo... what's up, bro?We don't see much of `em anymore. April seems to be working a lot - eww - and Casey seems to be, I dunno, \"different\" lately. Maybe he doesn't like having to put the toilet seat down now that they've moved in together.To be honest with ya, they're kinda buzzkills to be around.Dunno. Haven't noticed since The Nightwatcher has come home to roost. WOOOOHOOOOOOOO!Just a sec, dude! I'm almost at level eighteen. Scratch that... seventeen.I'm with Leo!You kiddin' me?! I mean, no offense Donnie, but you ain't exactly the biggest hitter on the bench.So nice of you to join us, gentledudes.Whoa! Whawazzat?! The others rush over to the edge with Mikey.So what now, captain?Welcome home.Well, there's a good/bad news scenario for ya. CAM BEGINS TO CRANE UP from Turtles to activity on the floor.Good news is that there are a buncha Foot Ninja gettin' the snot kicked out of `em. CAM FINISHES ON FLOOR - Showing SIX FOOT NINJAS and KARAI squaring off against a LARGE BIGFOOT-LIKE MONSTER! It tosses them around like stuffed animals.I vote for sitting back and enjoying the show. Whaddaya say, leader boy? ON LEO - He's troubled. The burden of \"leader\" shouldered.What? I saw it on a nature show once. The creature SCREAMS BACK! Boys freak out.Y'know, it's not that bad, dudes. ON BUILDING - Actually, the place is destroyed. Dented, torn and looking like a post-night raid in WWII.Dudes, did anyone get the license plate of the thing that hit us last night? Oi, my head... Don pours over a thick book on MONSTERS AND MYTHOLOGY.I dunno, but she sure gave Leo a run for his money.Dudes-can-it-here-comes-Splinter. ON DOOR - Splinter walks in, HUMMING to himself.Anyone for dessert?I'd say that's a big ten-four.Well?! WHAT NEXT?!!!Well, aside from having your own wrestling league, I dunno... MAYBEIs that \"legend\" like the ginormous freakin' hairball that attacked us?Seriously, dude. We're all stressed. Try to chill.Dudes. I think you're gonna want to check this out.But without Leo... what do we do? No one answers. Splinter looks to Raph. Raph steps up.Well, I didn't see you offering any suggestions... besides- - a true ninja can hide in plain sight, my son!What?! Why does everyone always call ME out? A long beat. Then...What do we do, dudes?!Leo! Is that you? RAARRGH! - A claw swoops out. He dodges out of the way.I guess that would be a \"no\". ON RAPH - He finds Leo!Yup. He's WAY dead, dude. WINTERS GASPS FOR AIR! Startles everyone in the room. ON EVERYONE - Their faces all drop as Winters stands up in his mini-crater, brushes himself off and is perfectly fine! Winters' mind is racing a mile a minute. Doesn't even notice those around him.Teamwork. The more you know... Don clocks Mikey behind the head.Roger dodger, dude. The TMNT launch into their FINAL ATTACK - perfectly in synch and take out each of the Generals, knocking them back into the PORTAL! They're plucked out of mid-air by cloudy tendrils and pulled back! The Turtles collapse onto the floor, back to the portal. Silent.

April's disappointed. Same old Casey.I'm sorry, babe. I must've-I missed you? April doesn't answer. She closes the phone. Casey slumps in his chair, shaking his head.Good goin', Case. Back at the dock, April is back to business.Nah, you know I work for a livin'. It's Star Center or nothin' else.Busted! Have fun with your mommy... ...oh no. OFF HIS LOOK - We see APRIL, dressed stunning in a dark business suit at the other side of the street. She's dangling a WHITE SHIRT and a TIE from her other hand.Later boys!Do you need my funtahstick muscles?Actually, It's Ca-Yeah-ha! The fourth General.Oh. He hands it to April as she twirls up a CROW-BAR and cracks open the front panel. INSIDE BOX POV - The light gradually breaks in, until - CREAK - the front panel falls to the floor. CLOSE ON - Winters' look. Pure wonder and admiration. He walks up to it slowly. April and Casey cautiously stay back.What!? It was a boring story!Well, maybe if you were home for more than four days at a time, you'd see that I DON'T WANT ANY OFHere I am nice enough to help you out, dress in this get-up and all I get is grief?! ...as he knocks and SMASHES the vase to the floor.Oh boy. Klaxons sound as SHINK-SHINK-SHINK - METAL PLATES SLAM DOWNNah. Ever since you started with the blade weapons you, um... you kinda scare me.Yeah?Yeah. Sure. You? April thinks just as much.I'm going outside for some air.Hey champ. You think you're being a little rough on the guy? ight slowly turns around. Menacing. Casey's taken aback.Are you that Nightwatcher fella? A little smaller than I expected.I'm talkin' to you, pal. You think you own these rooftops? Well, lemme teach you a thing'r two. Class is Pain 101. Meet your instructor... Casey Jones. It's getting serious. Casey's bat is suddenly wrapped by Night's CHAIN, and pulled down. Raph's visor flips up.Raph?! Is that you?! What-what are you doing?!Why would you- -oh. So that would mean...Stick with Nightwatcher, ninja boy.They're good... I guess. I dunno, seems like all I do lately is just make her upset. She used to laugh so much... now it's mostly just working all day, and coming home to point out how I'm a screw up. She doesn't like me doing this. And I know she's pretending to not know I'm out tonight. But she knows. And she knows I know she knows. Life just kinda got complicated suddenly... y'know?Raph?Nice to see ya, man. Raph acknowledges. The moment is broken by a HORRIBLE SHRIEK!What the shell. ON RAPH - He stops, mid-replacement of his helmet.I think we lost it.The freakin' FOOT?! What about the walking statues? Were you going to mention THOSE?!On second thought... The Generals put the Creature in a cell. Wheel it to a TRANSPORTER VEHICLE as it drives away. They're just about to leave when-Not good. Raph takes out NINJA SMOKE PELLETS and throws them on the roof - FWOOM! When the smoke clears, Casey is standing there alone! Raph is 10 feet away as Casey flinches and takes off too.Hey - you're the ninja, not me! BOOM! - Gato lands up on the roof and quickly gives chase! They can't lose him, even when they drop to street level.What are we gonna do, Raph? WHATUm, Raph? Raph sees the blade! They manage to switch positions in mid- ride, with Casey driving and Raph in back. Raph throws kicks and punches at their pursuer when he closes in. The chase takes them to a PARKING GARAGE as they circle upwards, Gato jumping from car to car, still on their tails! ROOFTOP - They're trapped. He doesn't have a hope... aside from jumping the bike to the next roof!Oh crap. Casey guns it - BUT THE BIKE DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE - as Gato is in mid-air, taking off. Casey grabs the weakening Raph and drags him off.Gotta get you someplace safe, pal. And then, then I need to go buy some new undies.Could use a little... help here...Would it help things if I said that we were being chased by a one of those statues you collected for that Winters guy? ON APRIL - Her mouth is agape.And I suppose that bringing up the thirty-foot flying monster would probably just push this over the edge, huh? ON APRIL - She slowly turns to Casey. Floored.Just some story this Winters guy told us. It all started down in South America. Long before the Ashmecks and the Macaroons.That's what i said.Raph. Don't do it, man.Wow.Oh... oh yeah. They share the moment. Seeing what they forgot about each other when they first met. It's enough for them to smile.Mask? What mask? April runs into the other room and comes back with her hands behind her back. She takes out a NEW MASK for Casey - cool, crisp and a badass paintjob.No way...Yeah, hey, I was supposed to drop this off for Mr. Winters. If I don't get this done, I am majorly in the doghouse. You know what I'm sayin', right? Right? The two stare at each other as the CAM ANGLES BEHIND KARAI - she's holding a KATANA SWORD behind her back! AM DOLLIES OVERHEAD as we see that Casey is packing MAJOR sports gear \"heat\" on his end too. Both don't let on.Really!? I mean, \"but of course\". Casey wheels the crate inside. The gate closes only KARAI HAS NOW DISAPPEARED! Casey opens the front hatch, revealing Don, Raph, Mikey, April and Splinter.I suppose this is where we all take out our sharp and pointy things?I have my moments...Is he... is he dead? Mikey takes out a hockey stick from Casey's bag and pokes Winters' limp body. Nothing.I got shotgun! BACK ON GENERALS - They move toward Winters! The Turtles quickly look at one another. Know what they have to do. They all leap in the way, standing between Winters and his backstabbing Generals. Aguila moves forward to Leo. Raph steps in beside him, defiant. Then Mikey. Then Don.This has got to be the suckiest vehicle to save the world with. - as the Cowabunga Carl van roars around the corner. Tinkling musical notes chime along with the speed. Appropriately lame and embarrassing. INSIDE VAN - Casey drives, as April, Karai and Four Foot are crammed in the back. Awkward silence.So... anybody from out of town?Well, I guess we have to figure out how to get handsome here back to Winters' Tower.Wow. You're... hard core. ON CREATURE - A Foot Ninja stands next to the lifeless body. As he turns his head he doesn't see THE CREATURE'S EYE OPEN!Incoming! ON VAN - As they open the doors to act as shields as - THUNKA THUNK THUNK - darts stick in the door! ON CREATURE - He's now standing... and dying to chase something. It GROWLS/SCREAMS as they all pile into the van! Casey immediately throws it in reverse and starts peeling back on the pier, barely staying out of the clutches of the creature smashing the pier in front of them. Get to the end and spin the vehicle around.Ran outta food. They all look out the back window as the creature pounds closer and closer... BACK IN LOBBY - The Turtles and Generals are at a standstill. Turtles all get thrown into a pile between the Generals.Oh. I, uh - HUHN! - Casey tosses Karai off of him.

ON DOOR - Raphael walks in, his Nightwatcher costume no where in sight.Whatta we talkin' about, boys? Soundin' a little too egghead fer my tastes.I joined a book a' the month club. So just what's your beef with puttin' dirtbags behind bars, Donnie? Go ahead... enlighten me.Sometimes there are lines that even the police can't cross. Someone has to be willing to do what needs to be done. And to do that, fear becomes a weapon.Hey. Raphael eyes Leo... and then the medallion.So... congratulations.Well, I'm goin' to bed. He leaves. TV ROOM - Raph walks through the room, cuffs Don on the back of the head, and keeps on walking.Leo's home. Donatello wakes up, looks around. LIGHTS UP when he sees Leo.This should explain most of it. The legacy of the city's newest hero. Compliments of the fanboy over there. MI can only hope, Mikey. I can only hope... Leo disapprovingly flips through the book.I been busy.Why'd you think that?Are you trying to make me mad?You wouldn't understand the first thing about me, daddy's boy - OOF!. hey both trip over a duct, tumbling in a ball. They stop rolling, continue fighting.You'd love that, wouldn't you?Later! Raph RUNS OFF toward the action.Ahh, let's take a tiny peek. They scale to the top floor. Peering over the edge.Nah. We kick butt. Raph jumps forward! Leo rolls his eyes, as all the Turtles jump into the fray. The Foot are surprised at first, and the Bigfoot Monster is confused as well. ON LEO - He stops when he comes face to face with Karai.Nice of ya's ta join me. But the Turtles eventually get cornered. And just as the Creature closes in-We coulda taken it if you slackers woulda pitched in sooner.Hey, you're the \"trained master\", not me.Splinter-junior.We hafta go out and find who's responsible for this. There ain't no other solution.Wow, sounds... exciting.Case? No way!Yep. IN BG - The Burglar tries to get away. Casey and Raph both spy him. Look at each other. Mischievously grin as we-I dunno, I just got tired of the \"nothing\". Sitting around waiting for some disaster to cross our paths. Of us battling Utroms and Triceratons or any other friggin' creature... when there was still some guy gettin' mugged 100 feet above the lair. Just didn't seem right. `Specially if we had the means to do somethin' about it. Raph twirls a billy bat between his fingers. Stops.And we did... but turns out I was the only one who was willing to do it, tho. So I just saved up, bought and tweaked a sweet bike, fitted the costume and began moonlighting.I kinda liked \"The Midnight Marauder\"...Pfft. You kiddin' me? Leo's been away for, like, forever. And the other two are so wrapped up in that party business they'd never notice.Yer tellin' me... Casey looks at his old bud.Yeah?For old time's sake?It's gotta be around here somewhere. SCREEEEECH!!! - A large VAMPIRE-LIKE CREATURE flies up from the alley below and spreads its 30-foot wings!Did I mention we ran into a monster last week?Nope. Those are a first for me too. We can take `em. One of the generals effortlessly picks up a TRASH DUMPSTER and wallops the Creature with one blow.Bingo. Raphael quickly dashes left through TRAFFIC! DOWN ALLEY BEHIND THEM - BOOM BOOM BOOM - We see Gato bounding down the wall, almost in a four-legged run, occasionally jumping off walls at incredible speeds! A true jaguar. It leaps through the traffic as well.Hop on. Raph leaves Gato in a cloud of dust... but not for long. Gato clamors along... keeping up with the weaving bike! In the fray, Casey looses his mask... as it gets trampled by Gato. It's an insane chase, with Raph trying to lose him as Casey swings his bat, trying to stave off the Stone General. Suddenly - THUNK! A circular OBSIDIAN BLADE lands in his wooden bat. He looks at it.Not to mention having a keen interest in these monsters... and them four stone jokers.Well, what would you do with an army of monsters?I say we just storm the castle and face this jerk in person!Yeah... whatever. - and bolts out the door.You're so friggin' smug! You think the world revolves around YOU, dontcha? That we couldn't POSSIBLY survive without the mighty and powerful Leonardo to guide us through our problems, HUH?!...and whoever said I wanted to be led? I shoulda gone on that training!Well, big brother, I'd have to disagree with you on that one. Raph takes a ready stance. Leo does too. And they fight. Brother vs. brother. Katana vs. Sai. Technique vs. Heart.I did something... I did something really stupid, Master Splinter.But Master Splinter, I messed up big tonight... I mean BIG. Splinter chews on this.Thank you... father. Mikey bursts in the door, frantic.We rescue our brother... and save New York City. Splinter stands to his side.You know I ain't much on speeches.Don't push it. April, this is going to be dangerous. You sure you're in?I am SO gonna enjoy this...We get ready for round two. ON CASEY IN CORNER - He reaches into his back, takes out a hockey stick and - SMASH!!! - kills a LOBBY VASE. Suddenly, sirens blare as the OUTSIDE BUILDING SECURITY SHUTTERS SLAM DOWN just like in Act I! The Ninjas are locked out!Yeah! Everyone high fives Casey. Except April. She smiles.Hey buddy! Come on, man. Leo, please wake up! Raph holds Leo in his lap on the floor. Looks like Leo is DEAD. Raph's head falls low, as...Listen, I - I'm sorry.No harm?! Whatever! I'm about to give you piercin's in places you never imagined if you don't tell us what's going on.If you mess with one of us- -you mess with all of us. Aguila smiles at their chutzpa.Sensei! How you guys doing?! ON SPLINTER AND WINTERS - The portal is pulling the cells in. About five more to go. Splinter also flips around and takes out another demon trying to escape. Splinter actually seems to be having FUN.I'm sure my man Casey's got it all under control...So who wants ta call it a day?I thought he'd never shut up. WIDER - The portal EXPLODES in a upwards funnel. Silence.You know us?She doesn't mean... They look back - and see Karai and the Foot have DISAPPEARED. Raph looks over at WINTERS. He's hunched over in the corner. Can't tell what's going on. They walk over slowly.Winters? ON WINTERS - Looks like he's sobbing. They get concerned. Then the sobs turn to LAUGHING. He stands up. His hand is spotted red with his M own BLOOD from a cut on his cheek.Thank you, Master Splinter, for your guidance. I can only hope that one day, I will be able to begin the next stage of my training like Leo. Splinter smiles. Reaches into a box and takes out a similar MEDALLION to the one given to Leonardo.So we're cool with the whole Nightwatcher thing?Okay, so I couldn't exactly destroy the bike.I mean, it's in good hands.So what makes a family? Personally, it's more than sharing a roof or a bathroom. It's sharing life... My father taught me that, and I think it's pretty much true... y'know, provided that you don't kill each other in the process. Or that no one touches your stuff.

He walks to the large bay windows that overlooks the city.Tell them I'm on my way down. He slowly LOWERS OUT OF FRAME. CAM PULLS OUT WIDER REVEALING - Winters Office is an \"elevator\" of sorts that can ride up and down the front of the building, allowing him access to any floor of his Tower without leaving his desk. WIDER - see the Tower is a monolith in the middle of Manhattan - complete with it's own front Central Park-ish gated entry. A true work of modern architecture.Miss O'Neil. You are a vision. Thirty days in a jungle, and beautiful as ever. He shakes her hand and double-cheek kisses her. Casey's eyes widen - is THIS what his girlfriend does?Chris! How's it going? Winters nearly crushes Casey's hand in his grip.So how was your trip?It was a time long before the Mayans, April. Long before the Aztecs and even the Olmecs. It was a time of legends. A time of greatness. The true mother culture of Central America. Cool shots of Yaotl. His armor, his stance, etc.And for every culture they destroyed, they drank in all the magic and knowledge known to them.Then they came across a culture rich with science, magic and their own technology. A South American version of \"Atlantis\".As the army approached, Yaotl used the knowledge they'd gained in black magic and sorcery. Timing their attack with the alignment of the Stars of Kikin, they opened a portal to another world. ON CHARGING ARMY - they stop dead in their tracks. Front-lit by the OS portal. Don't know what to expect - ON PORTAL - A crackling electric circle opens to another dimension. Suddenly - DOZENS OF MONSTERS EXPLODE OUT! Creatures of all varieties. Gnashing Fangs. Swiping claws.They unleashed an army of monsters. N BATTLEFIELD - men getting slaughtered . Quick shots. Intense.The monsters knew no side - they destroyed the enemy... as well as Yaotl's own army. Men who swore to spill their blood for his cause. Yaotl had to do something to stop more from coming through.In the end, there were no victors. And they were responsible for the eradication of the greatest culture that will never be known. The knowledge that was lost would never be found again...Oh no, Miss O'Neil. looks back to statue) Like you said... just a story. inters doesn't break his stare.One of the girls will pay your fee on the way out.You can come out now. IDER - As we see FOUR FIGURES appear out of the smallest and darkest of shadows! The LEADER slinks forward - clearly aYour talents are commendable.Well, I guess I'm just special that way. Winters walks over to his desk. The Statue looms behind them.So down to business - aside from the other reasons for your visit to America, are you interested in my offer we discussed?I need the finely-tuned eyes and stealth of your Foot Ninja to... monitor the city for me over the next few days. Winters walks to his window. It's night. Overlooks the city.Just keep your eyes peeled for anything... strange.What seems to be the problem? Karai and six Ninja are already there.Oooooooh... It sets the Foot off. They all grab their weapons, moving toward Winters. Karai flips forward, sword drawn and at Winters throat! ...as Winters stands still... and begins to LAUGH. Slowly, the thumping of FOUR SETS OF FEET lumber out of the shadows. Reveal themselves to be THE FOUR STONE GENERALS. They flank Winters, who is just loving the theatricality of it all. The Foot Ninja leap back. Winters remains confident and unmoving. Generals SMIRK at Karai and the Foot.I believe we made a deal, Karai. I expect you to honor it. You do understand \"honor\", don't you? Karai stews... unblinking stare. Of course she does.So I don't care what part of \"muscle for hire\" you don't understand. I hired your muscle. Now exercise the ones attached to your feet and... ...get back to work.Are we... cool? The Foot don't move. Tense. Karai finally nods. Terse.Ninjas. No sense of humor. So how did we fare? CORRIDOR ENTRANCE - a hunched SHAPE undulating in chains is wheeled into the light. Winters approaches it - chained to a high-tech and uplit pallet on the floor. We can barely make it out as being the HAIRY CREATURE from the I-beam fight.So it begins... It SCREAMS. Fights it's restraints. Tires. Breathing heavily. Winters approaches, safely inches away from his fanged maw. Creature suddenly lunges forward! Winters doesn't flinch. He merely grins at the creature.Were there any problems? AGUILA speaks in a gravelly, hardened voice. He towers over Winters by a foot. Clearly the leader of the four.You see, now THAT'S a good soldier. You two should compare notes. Karai and Aguila stare at each other. Karai obviously not used to being handled like this.Oh, let's call it a scavenger hunt. I now have the power and know-how, but I need the speed and stealth of an organization such as your own. Not to mention an organization that values discretion.You see, I have nine more beasts like this that should be coming to town very soon. Thirteen in all, to be exact. The Four Generals move the monster into a position on the floor ahead - into a DISK on the floor. ON CEILING - We see the top of a CAGE inserted over top, creating a cell.Instinct, mostly. They're animals at their core. And they recognize something familiar in the air... in the stars.What is it? Winters doesn't turn around. Stays in E-FG. Cam adjusts to show the shape of GENERAL AGUILA in the doorway.Well, by all means then. Let's finish it. ON AGUILA - He squints. Deep in thought and not sharing.Finally... finally! ON GENERALS - they're still. Emotionless. The light sequence gets to Leo's cell... it doesn't light up.What? His mind reels. Looks down at the cells. Nothing. Then it hits him like a ton of bricks. He turns to the Generals...What did you do?!Fascinating...We were so close... so close. Winters collapses on the floor. Head in hands.This was our chance. We could have changed it all.It was I who stood on that battlefield all those years ago. Winters/Yaotl looks out at the death and destruction. He looks shocked, surprised. A SHADOW falls over Winters body. He looks up - it's a ceremonial SHAMAN from their enemies' camp.And we had to pay a price. The Shaman makes hand gestures, chanting. Winters is pulled up in the air, and in a crackle of red electricity, we see him become... grayer. N GENERALS - Same electricity. Different effect. They scream, slowly turned into STONE. Cracks form on their bodies, light shooting out of it.We were cursed that day. My four comrades-in-arms were turned into stone.My curse was to live... forever. To feel the pain of losing love time and time again. Of boredom. The pain... of time. ACK IN PRESENT DAY. Winters stops walking...We were doomed to live this way until, as the Shaman put it, \"you corrected the mistakes of your past\". That's what this is about. Penance, Miss O'Neil. Finally getting a chance to right our wrongs.Never. This was our opportunity! We were wrong! Don't you understand?!Alright. We have more important things to do! ON PORTAL - A small DEMON makes its way out of the portal! Winters runs and flips through the air and then CLOBBERS IT with his bare hands, sending it back down! He lands on the other side.Help me push the cells into the portal! Splinter does as the two masters also manage to lay some smackdown on any emerging creature out of the portal.Thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
