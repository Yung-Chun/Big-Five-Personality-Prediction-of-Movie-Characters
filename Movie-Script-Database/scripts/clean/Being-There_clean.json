Yes, Louise, it's snowing in the garden today. Have you looked outside and seen the snow? It's very white.Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.Yes. It is.Yes, I'm very hungry.I'm going to work in the garden.Yes.Goodbye, Louise.Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.Yes.Yes, Thomas - I understand.Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.Yes.

I have always worked in the garden.Yes.Oh. Thank you.No.Compensated...?I was given meals, and a home...I never needed money.No, I do not have any of those.I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.Yes. Of men and women.Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.No.Those trees were very young when I first arrived.No, I don't think so. And I have planted and shaped all the hedges, and in the springtime you will be able to see my flowers.No. That's where Joe fixed the bricks.No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.... Well... From time to time I did sit in it... Just in here... It hasn't been outside since the Old Man hurt himself. I live in here.The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control. He has one just like it.Yes, I understand.I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.Yes. I have seen styles on television.I would like to stay and work in my garden.I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.I have no claim, Thomas.Correct.Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.Good day, Sally.... Excuse me, would you please tell me where I could find a garden to work in?... There is much to be done during the winter, I must start the seeds for the spring, I must work the soil...I had to leave my garden. I want to find another.No. Thomas Franklin told me that I had to leave the Old Man's house, he's dead now, you know...Yes. I understand. If I see Raphael I will tell him.Yes. Of course. Good day.I'm very hungry now. Would you please bring me my lunch?I have seen your game! I have watched Elvin Hayes play it many times! They call him \"Big E!\"Excuse me... ... That tree is very sick. It should be cared for.Yes. That would be a good thing to do. Good day.... I can't move... My leg...No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.It's very sore.There's no need for police, it's just my leg.I agree.Of course. I would like to look.Yes.There's no need for a hospital.I've never ridden in an automobile.... Yes. You can take me.... My suitcase.Yes. I am.Yes. He's a very careful driver.It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.Your family doctor?I agree.Yes. Thank you.I would like to watch television.Hello, Eve.My name is Chance.No. I'm a gardener.No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.Yes. I lost my remote control.I like to watch. This is fine.Yes.Yes, I think he should examine my leg.... I've never been in one of these.Does it have a television?I see.How long do we stay in here?I understand. I've seen it done before.You were wrong, it did hurt.Yes. I think so, too.I see.Oh, fine.... Straight out?Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.Thomas Franklin, an attorney.Yes.There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.Thank you.Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.No.Yes, I will.... That is a very small room.Yes. It seems to be.... I see.I feel very good in here.Yes. I like that very much.Do you know Raphael?Oh. I have a message for him.A Black man gave me the message.Yes. You look very sick.I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.I agree.Yes. I am very hungry.No. It won't do that.No. The Old Man died and Louise left.No, thank you. My house has been closed.Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.No. I like it here.Yes. Chauncey is fine.Yes, Robert. I will.Does this house have a garden?I see. I would like to work in your garden.I am a very good gardener.Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.But I don't have that any more... ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.It's a very pleasant room, Ben.Yes, thank you. No Ben. I don't know everything about you.Thank you, Robert.No, Ben.I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.I agree.... Hmmm... Elevator.Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?That's good.Good night, Eve.Yes. I would like a car.It's fine today, Robert.Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.Hardly any, Robert.Oh, thank you.No, Robert.Yes, Robert. I know about the President.Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.How do I know when it's ten o'clock?Thank you, Robert.I would like to walk today.Oh, really?Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.Yes.Yes, I would like to see Ben.Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.You're looking much better today, Ben.I understand.Thank you, Ben. ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.I see, Ben.Yes, Ben. That's a good idea.I agree, Ben.Yes.Thank you very much.Good morning, Mr. President.You look much taller on television, Mr. President.Yes, I will.Yes?Yes?As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...Yes. That is correct.Yes. It has.Yes. I will.Yes, Ben - he is.I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.No, Ben.I understand.Thank you, Ben.I'm sorry that you are so sick, Ben.Hello, Eve.Yes. It's feeling much better now.Fine. He's very nice.Yes.He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.... Mentor...?Yes. I was.Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.Oh, no. She brought me my meals.What is that?Oh, I like that very much.So am I, Eve.Thank you.Yes.Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.Hello.Hello, Sid.No. I'm not busy.The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.I have nothing more to say.Hmmm. Elevator.No.Oh, yes.Yes, I have seen that show on television.Yes. I would like to be on that show.No. I like this attic very much.Yes. They are fine.Hello, Eve.Thank you, Eve.How is Ben feeling?That's good. I like to watch, too.Hello, Morton.I see.Yes. It's a very good show.Thank you. I'm very thirsty.Yes.You're welcome.Yes. That is surprising.I hope so.No. I don't object.Which view?Yes. I was there with Ben.Yes.Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.In a garden, things grow - but first some things must wither; some trees lose their leaves before they grow new leaves...... Then they grow thicker and stronger and taller. Some trees die, but fresh saplings replace them. Gardens need a lot of care and a lot of love.... And if you give your garden a lot of love, and if you work very hard and have a lot of patience, in the proper season you will see it grow to be very beautiful...Yes. We need a very good gardener.I understand.Oh, yes. It is possible for one side of the garden to be flooded, and the other side to be dry...... Some plants do well in the sun, and others grow better in the cool of the shade.... It is the gardener's responsibility to take water from the flooded area and run it to the area that is dry. It is the gardener's responsibility not to plant a sun-loving flower in the shade of a high wall...... It is the responsibility of the gardener to adjust to the bad seasons as well as enjoy the good ones. If the gardener does his job, everything will be fine.Thank you.I am a very serious gardener.Yes. Thank you, Perkins.Certainly, Ben.Yes. I would like to escort Eve.No, thank you.I see.Good night, Eve.Come in!No, Eve. I don't read the papers.I like the President. He is a very nice man.No, Eve. I like you to be here.Yes, Eve. I know that.Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.Yes. That could be true.Fine.I didn't read it.No. I did not glance at it.I did not read that either.I do not know what it means.I do not read any newspapers. I watch TV.I like to watch TV.You're welcome.Thank you, Eve.Yes.Hello, Dennis.Yes. It is.Hello, Sophia.Hello... His... His...I agree.Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.Ben is very ill.Yes, I agree, I think so too.Yes, I understand.We are not far... ... our chairs almost touch.I certainly do.Do you think so? Do you think so?Oh, good.Yes, it is. Would you tell me your name again, please?Yes. I like that name very much.Yes, Eve. That would be good.Thank you.Hello, Ronald.I can't write.I can't read.Yes. I like to watch.What sort of bed is it?I like to watch.Yes. I like to watch very much.I want to tell Eve.Yes.Yes, very well, thank you.Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.Yes, I do, it's very good.Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...I see.Thank you. But my leg is still a little sore.Are you sure you're not ill?No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.Thank you.I like to watch.Yes. I like to watch.Yes. It's very good, Eve.Good night, Eve.That's very interesting, Eve.Yes. I would like to see Ben.Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?Oh, I see.A flower...Yes. I would like to do that.Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.Will you be leaving now, Robert?Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.Yes. I love Eve very much.Yes, Robert - I am. I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert.Hello, Eve.Yes.

Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.Why, there certainly is. You must see a doctor, I insist on it. Please, let us take you.Oh, I don't think it was anyone's fault, David.I hope you're comfortable.These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?I see. ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you... David, we'll just go on home. Jeffrey, would you call and let them know?Would you care for a drink?Oh? Certainly...Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.May I ask your name?Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.Did you lose something?Oh... Well, I'm very sorry...... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer... ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.I admire that in a person. As for myself, I find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times...Good evening, Wilson.Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.Thank you, Greta. I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?No headaches?You heard?Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.Do you feel well enough for that?I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?Stay here? Is that necessary?Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days. ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?... Sometimes when I see Ben I could swear that he's getting stronger... Something that he might say, the way he moves, or a look in his eyes - makes me feel that this is all a nightmare and that he'll be better soon... It's just so hard to believe what's really happening...Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.Yes... I know, Chauncey.He does...?... Why... No, I don't think so...... Good night, Chauncey.Chauncey!Your leg must be getting better.Good. I'm glad to hear that. ... How did you like meeting the President?Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get to see him.... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.I'm sorry... ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.Of course.Our greenhouse.Yes, so do we.... I'm... ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey... ... With us ...... But he's...?I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...... He's such a sensitive man, so considerate...Chauncey...Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.I know you do - you and your television... ... Good luck, Chauncey.... Yes, I am, Ben.... Ben, really...... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.... I have very few friends, Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older...... Good night, Chauncey.Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.I know... ... So are you, Chauncey ... ... Do you mind my being here, like this?... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be... I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that... ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...I know you are, Chauncey... ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.... I guess I may as well be honest about my feelings, Chauncey, as I know you are I am in love with you... I love you and I want you... And I know that you know it and I'm grateful that you've decided to wait until... Until...... I do love you, Chauncey.Oh, come in, Maggie.Chauncey, Maggie will alter Ben's tuxedo for you now.I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.Mr. Watson.Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.Hello, Sophie.Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.It seems like ages, Mr. Ambassador. Mrs. Skrapinov.He's doing as well as could be expected, Mr. Ambassador. He still speaks of the stimulating discussions he's had with you.Of course.Would you two excuse me for a moment?I'll be back soon...Only to steal Mr. Gardiner away, if I might. Everyone wants to meet you.Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...It must be the punch, and it is stuffy in here -- I feel it a little myself. You're an angel, my dear - thank God there are still men like you around to give aid and comfort.I feel so close to you, so safe with you, Chauncey... ... And Benjamin understands that, dearest... He understands and accepts my feelings for you...... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...I can sense that you've been through a lot, Chauncey. But one day, when you feel like it, you'll tell me all about your life... ... But, even if you tell me nothing, even if it's too painful for you to reveal your past...Oh, Chauncey... I do love you so much!... You don't want me, Chauncey... You don't feel anything for me... Nothing at all...I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...To watch...? To watch me...?... Is that all you want...? ... To watch me...?... But I've never done... ... You mean...? When... When... When I do it? ... When I touch myself...?Oh, Chauncey...One of those little things you don't know about me yet, darling - I'm a little shy.... And I feel so free now, Chauncey. Until I met you, I never felt acknowledged by a man... ... I always had the feeling that I was just a vessel for a man, someone that he could take hold of, pierce, and pollute. I was merely an aspect of somebody's lovemaking. Do you know what I mean?Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.It was very moving, Bobby - thank you so much...Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...Thank you, Nancy.... Do you think we should look for him?I wish he were here...We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...There he is!

I'm sorry you had to go through all that.Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?Constance! I want new blood tonight, I'm getting up for dinner.Don't argue, tell Robert I want new blood! ... Ask him to dinner.Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.Aplastic anemia, Mr. Gardiner - aplastic anemia.Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...I am very sick, and, as you can see by all this paraphernalia, I am very wealthy. I think I would rather be wealthy and sick than poor and sick.... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?... So am I, my boy - so am I.I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!Of course! By kid-lawyers!Do you need a secretary?Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?And I'm Ben.So tell me, Chauncey, what are your plans now?Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.A gardener! Well put, Chauncey excellent! Isn't that what a businessman is? A gardener? A person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard.Bravo!Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for God's sake don't give up on yourself! You have to fight! You can't let those bastards keep you down! I don't want to hear any more from you about the 'Room Upstairs'. That's where I'm going soon.Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.... I don't know what you've heard about me, Chauncey, but I'm sure you know everything there is to know. Cigar?... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it.... You know, Chauncey, there are thousands of American businessmen, large and small, that share your plight. I've been concerned with the situation for some time now.So I've been thinking about beginning a financial assistance program, Chauncey, to help out American businessmen that have been harassed by inflation, excessive taxation, unions and other indecencies...... I'd like to offer the decent 'Gardeners' of the business community a helping hand. After all, they are our strongest defense against the pollutants who so threaten our basic freedoms and the well-being of our middle class. Tell me, would you have any thoughts on such a program?Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.... Oh? Robert, take a look, would you?We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?Well, that's good news, my boy.Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself...... Maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position, Chauncey... Maybe one day...He's here. Yes, Mrs. Aubrey? Fine. Show the President to the library, we'll be along in a few minutes.It's an old habit that goes along with power -- keep them waiting...Not now, Teresa. I'm seeing the President on my own two feet.Shall we go, Chauncey?Mrs. Aubrey, have you received the papers on the Caracas agreement?Excellent. A good woman, Mrs. Aubrey.Woltz, how have you been?... Mr. President, how good to see you.I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.You will find that my house guest does not bandy words, Mr. President.Yes, I did.Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.I'm afraid so.I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.You take care too, Bobby.He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.And now, Chauncey, I'm afraid you must excuse me - I'm very tired all of a sudden.Splendid. Just splendid...Damn, Constance, get in here! You shouldn't miss any of this!I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached... ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve.That's good... That's good.... You possess a great gift, Chauncey, of being natural. And that, my boy, is a rare talent, the true mark of a leader. You were strong and brave, yet did not moralize. I hope the entire country was watching you tonight, the entire country...In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much. ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.Everything. I said everything and that's exactly what I mean.What could be more precise than everything...?You two don't have to lecture me on the complexities of the situation, no one knows that better than myself... But you must understand that I have an endless faith in Mrs. Rand's abilities - I know that she will select the right person for guidance when she has the need... She has shared my life, gentlemen, she has given me far more pleasure than any of my so called assets... Life has suddenly become very simple for me now - I may be older than my years, and you might think me to be somewhat feeble... But I am still in love, gentlemen, thank God for that...No more, Robert... No more needles...I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things...No, I don't want any of that... Please... please, just get me Mr. Gardiner, Teresa - please... he'll head it up...... Chauncey... Chauncey...... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength... Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...... I've worked very hard and enjoyed my life... I've known success... and I've felt love... My associates, Chauncey - I've talked with them about you... They're eager to meet you... very eager to meet you... I'm very fond of you, Chauncey... And I understand Eve... Tell her that... tell her I'm madly in love with her...", "clean_line": "eve tired getting tired tired good day better ve told shut lack news sorry reasonable good like meet reasonable man ask
