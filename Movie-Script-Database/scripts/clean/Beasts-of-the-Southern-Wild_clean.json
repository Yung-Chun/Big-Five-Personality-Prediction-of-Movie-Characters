{"Beasts-of-the-Southern-Wild": {"HUSHPUPPY": {"raw_line": "All the time, everywhere, everything's organs be beatin' and squirtin' and talkin' to each other in ways I can't understand. Mosta the time they probably just sayin' \"I'm hungry,\" or \"I gotta poop,\" but sometimes they talkin' in codes.Feed up time! Feed up!Daddy says, up above the levee, on the dry side, they're afraid of the water like a bunch of babies. They built the wall that cuts us off.They think we all gonna drown down here. But we ain't goin' nowhere.The Bathtub's got more holidays than the whole rest of the world.Daddy always saying, that up in the dry world, they got none of what we got.They only got holidays once a year.They got fish stuck in plastic wrappers, they got their babies stuck in carriages, and chickens on sticks and all that kind of stuff.One day, the storm's gonna blow, the ground's gonna sink, and the water's gonna rise up so high, there ain't gonna be no Bathtub, just a whole bunch of water.But me and my Daddy, we stay right here. We who the earth is for.Way back in the day, the Aurochs was king of the world.If it wasn't for giant snowballs, and the iced age. I wouldn't even be Hushpuppy, I would just be breakfast.Daddy? Feed-up time. Feed-up?Daddy?DADDY!?Kids that got no Mamma, no Daddy and nobody. They got to live in the woods, and eat grass, and steal underpants.Daddy? Daddy?If Daddy don't get home soon, it's gonna be time for me to start eating my pets.My Daddy's coming to pick me up.Everything we still got from Mamma, we keep in my house.Daddy says, the first time she looked at me, it made her heart beat so big, that she thought it would blow up. That's why she swam away.Hi momma.Yes, mamma.That's pretty Mamma.Daddy! Daddy, Daddy!I learned lots of stuff while you gone. If I drink all this here I can burp like a man.How come you wearing a dress?You wearing a bracelet too?I wanna come in your house.I WANNA COME IN YOUR HOUSE!If Daddy kill me, I ain't gonna be forgotten, I'm recording my story for the scientists of the future.In a million years, when kids go to school, they gonna know that once there was Hushpuppy and she lived with her Daddy in the Bathtub.I'm tearing off!I'm tearing off just like my Momma.I hope you do die! And after you die, I come to your grave and eat birthday cake all by myself!Momma!? Momma!? MOMMA!? I think I broke something.Miss Bathsheba! Miss Bathsheba! My Daddy fell down!Daddy could have turned into a tree, or a bug. There wasn't any way to know.The whole universe depends on everything fitting together just right. If one piece busts, even the smallest piece, the entire universe will get busted.What happened to y-Mamma!? MAMMA!?For every animal that didn't have a Dad to put it in a boat, the end of the world already happened. They're all down below, trying to breathe through water.I gotcha!OW!Daddy?Mamma? Is that you?I've broken everything.Strong animals, they know when your hearts are weak. That makes them hungry and they start coming.Back when Daddy used to talk about Mamma, he'd say she was so pretty she never even had to turn on the stove.She just walk into a room and water start to boil.Miss Bathsheba!?For the ones we'd never find, we make a funeral the Bathtub way, with no crying allowed.It wasn't no time to sit around crying like a bunch of pussies.We was gonna build a camp right on top of the Bathtub.We got enough animals to eat until the water goes down.You wanna leave the Bathtub, Walrus?Everything gonna go right back?Daddy says, brave men don't run from their home.The entire universe depends on everything fitting together just right. If you can fix the broken piece, it can all go right back.It didn't matter that the water was gone. Sometimes, you can break something so bad, that it can't get put back together.Mamma!?Mamma where you at!?When you're small, you gotta fix what you can.Raaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!Man. You think I don't know.You gonna be gone?You gonna leave me alone?Cause if you be gone, I be gone too.I will. Sometimes in the bed I start shaking and can't stop. I got what you got.I ain't gonna be dead?Guns! Guns! Guns! Guns!.....I'm the man.I'm the man!I'm THE MAN!!!!!!!Yea?Strong animals got no mercy.They the type of animals that eats their own Mommas and Daddies.It didn't look like a prison, it looked like a fish tank with no water.Daddy!I don't want your hug!When an animal gets sick here, they plug it into the wall.They're coming for you.Daddy says, if he ever got so old he couldn't drink beer, or catch catfish, that I had to put him in a boat, and set him on fire, so no one could come plug him into the wall.Where we goin'?NO! I ain't running! No!Let me go!You trying to get rid of me! You trying to get rid of me!Why you trying to get rid of me?You is.Yes you can.Don't be sayin' about dying.Not my Daddy.Come on! Come on!Everybody looses the thing that made them, it's even how it's supposed to be in nature.The brave men stay and watch it happen. They don't run.Come on! Keep going!I'm going by my Mamma.Which way are we going?I wanna be cohesive.You can take care of me. Me and Daddy.This is my favorite thing.I can count all the time I've been lifted.I can count all the times I've been lifted on two fingers.I need to go home.You're my friend, kind of.I gotta take care of mine.No crying.When I relax behind my eyes I see everything that made me flying around in invisible pieces. When I look too hard it goes away, but when it all goes quiet, I see they are right here.I see that I'm a little piece of a big, big universe, and that makes things right.When I die, the scientists of the future, they gonna find it all.
