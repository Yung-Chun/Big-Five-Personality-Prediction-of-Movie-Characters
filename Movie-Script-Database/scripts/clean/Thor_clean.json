{"Thor": {"JANE": {"raw_line": "Hurry! We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below. Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG who emerges as well, rubbing his head.Oh-- watch your head.It's a little different each time. Once it looked like, I don't know, melted stars, pooling in a corner of the sky. But last week it was a rolling rainbow ribbon--Hey, Darcy. Pass up the bubbly and my gloves, will you? Intern DARCY LEWIS hands Jane a bottle of Champagne and a pair of gloves through the window. Jane passes it to Selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves -- too large and masculine for her small hands. He starts to unwrap the foil, and she stops his hand with an excited grin.Not until you see it!Thank you.The benefit of the doubt. The two stare out at the sky expectantly. A long beat while they scan the skies. Nothing. Jane's worried.It's never taken this long before. Darcy calls up from the front seat.Sure, if you like rocking out to KFRM, \"All agriculture, all the time.\"\u009d Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle.The anomalies are always precipitated by geomagnetic storms. She shows him a complicated CHART she's drawn in the book, tracking occurrences and patterns.The last seventeen occurrences have been predictable to the minute... I just don't understand. Something catches Darcy's eye out the driver's side mirror. She adjusts it. In the distance, ODD GLOWING CLOUDS form in the skies over the Northeastern end of the desert.There's got to be some new variable... Or an equipment malfunction... The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around them. The computer monitors SQUELCH with static.What?!Holy. Shatner.No-- yes! Let's go!Isn't this great?! A thought strikes her.You're seeing it too, right? I'm not crazy?You've gotta get us closer so I can take a magnetic reading. Darcy laughs.You want those college credits or not?What are you doing?!Get the first aid kit. Darcy heads back inside the SUV as Jane, concerned, kneels next to the man. Selvig hovers, protectively. She gently turns his head to the light, and we see him clearly for the first time. He is magnificently handsome, long blonde hair flowing around his classically sculpted features. She cups her hands around his face, as if willing the life back into him.Come on, big guy. Do me a favor and don't be dead, okay? Open your eyes and look at me. Suddenly, he GROANS, and she's startled, then relieved, as his eyes flutter open. She looks deep into his confused, azure eyes, which at last focus on her own. Locking onto them. For a moment, they each forget to breathe. The connection is broken as Darcy returns with the kit. She freezes when she sees how gorgeous the man is.--are dilating. That's a good sign.Where did he come from? They exchange puzzled looks, as we move up through the last glowing remnants of the storm, and into:Get the first aid kit.Uh, thanks. Are you okay? Thor searches the ground.Erik... look at this. He joins her at her side and sees it. A faint, discernible pattern is etched into the sand. They exchange a look. Amazed and excited, Jane hurriedly takes out a camera and snaps some photos of the runes. A breeze begins to blow them away.We've got to move fast before anything changes.We need soil samples, light readings, everything. She pulls out a light meter, holds it up, takes some readings, jots them down in her notebook. Selvig looks at Thor, who stares up at the sky.Not right now. It'll take too long. County's an hour away. We'll drop him off after we're done here. Selvig looks uncertain.Okay, you and Darcy take him to the hospital, I'll stay here.Erik, just back away...He said it was \"Thor.\"\u009d The Nurse painstakingly types it into the computer, one key at a time. Jane watches as Thor is wheeled out of the room.I've never met him before.Grazed him, actually.I told you, I don't know him. I just want to make sure he's okay.Jane Foster.Darcy, when you're done, take the soil samples to Professor Meyers in geology. Remind him, he owes me.\"We?\"\u009dYou know what would be really useful? Do you still have that friend at LIGO?Could you call in a favor?If I'm right, their observatory must have picked up gravitational waves during last night's event.Meaning these anomalies might signify something bigger.I think the lensing around the edges is characteristic of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.She was the only applicant.Erik, look...What do you see here?Yes. But not our stars. She spreads out a STAR CHART, barely able to contain her excitement.This is the star alignment for our quadrant, this time of year. So unless Ursa Minor decided to take the day off... those are someone else's constellations. Selvig's intrigued, in spite of himself. Darcy pulls another frame-grab of the Bifrost footage from the printer and hangs it on the wall, when something in the image catches her eye.I think I left something at the hospital. As Jane walks away, we REVEAL the photo. Inside the Bifrost funnel cloud is a FIGURE -- the vague, but unmistakable shape of a MAN.I meant I barely know him anymore. The man he's become. He's changed. I mean, what woman really knows her husband, anyway?Typical. I just lost my most important piece of evidence.We find him.I want to know what that thing was, and he may have the answers. We don't have a choice.However long it takes. Jane puts the car in reverse and backs up, when --I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not doing that on purpose.Excuse me... excuse me! She leads him away from the work station. Thor holds up the t-shirt. On the front, it bear a sticker which reads: \"HELLO, MY NAME IS DR. DONALD BLAKE\"\u009d. Thor looks at it, puzzled. Jane rips the sticker off.My ex. Thor stares at her a beat.They're the only clothes I had that'll fit you. Sorry.You're welcome. Now tell me... Thor studies the frame-grabs with interest. Jane points to his form in the Bifrost photo.What were you doing, in that? He glances at it, dismissive.What exactly is the Bifrost?Somebody get the mortal a Pop-Tart.Now tell us exactly what happened to you last night. Thor looks her in the eyes, staring, intrigued. Jane gets flustered, looks away.Maybe start with how you got inside that cloud.Sorry, Izzy. Little accident.What was that? He doesn't understand. The other patrons stare at him.Then you should just say so!I mean ask for it. Nicely.All right, then no more smashing, deal?Good.Excuse me, did you say there was a satellite crash?Where are you going?Why?So now you own a satellite?Whatever it is, the government seems to think it's theirs. You intend to just walk in there and take it?Everything?You know what we saw last night. This can't be a coincidence. I want to know what's in that crater.He's promised us answers.I'd just be driving him out there, that's all.I'm sorry. I can't take you.That's... thank you. Thor bows slightly to each of them.Hey! That's my stuff!What the hell is going on here?! The Agents ignore her as Agent Coulson approaches.I don't care who you work for, you can't do this!Let it go?! This is my life!By \"appropriate\"\u009d you mean \"steal?\"\u009d Instead of answering, Coulson gives her a check.I can't just pick up replacements from RadioShack! I made most of that equipment myself!And I'm sure I can sue you for violating my constitutional rights!So are we! We're on the verge ofEverything I know about this phenomenon is in this lab and in this book, and no one has the right to take it from me. Coulson gestures to a nearby AGENT, who promptly plucks the notebook out of Jane's hands and adds it to the pile he's carrying. Jane is stunned.Years of research, gone.Look around! They took our back- ups. They took the back-ups of our back-ups.I'm not going to let them do this. I'm getting everything back.You still want a lift?I've never done anything like this before! Have you ever done anything like this before? Thor looks amused by her excitement.They just stole my entire life's work. I really don't have anything left to lose.\"This Realm?\"\u009d Why do you talk like that?Yeah. Just a little.I'm not quite sure yet. She looks at him, sees him staring at her. She's lost in his gaze, distracted, when the PINZGAUER LURCHES. She quickly turns her eyes forward, regains control of the car.Sorry. She glances back at him. He's confident, determined.Who are you? Really?You promised me answers.A bridge? Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?God, I hope you're not crazy.That isn't a satellite crash. They would have hauled the wreckage away, not built a city around it. Thor shrugs out of his jacket and hands it to her.Why?-- Thunder RUMBLES overhead. She stares at him intently and takes his jacket.No! Look what's down there! You can't just walk in, grab our stuff, and walk out!Wait... But Thor is already headed towards the crater.Erik, okay, first of all, don't worry. I'm perfectly fine, really. More sounds of MAYHEM come from the base.But if you don't hear from me again, you might want to come out to the crater site and look for me. I kind of did what you said I shouldn't do. Thanks. Bye. She hangs up.No...I can't just leave him there.You didn't see what happened. Darcy points at an illustration of Thor's hammer in the book.Aren't you the one who's always told me to chase down all leads, all possibilities?Magic's just science we don't understand yet. Arthur C. Clarke.The precursor of science fact.If that's really an Einstein-Rosen Bridge out there, then there's something on the other side.Advanced beings could have come through it before.Yes! Exactly! Thank you! Darcy beams.Erik!What happened?Put him on the bed. Thor moves through the small trailer carrying Selvig, like a bear lugging another bear, smashing into things along the way, until he finally sets Selvig down on Jane's bed. Selvig awakens groggily and looks up at him through bleary eyes.Well, it's more of a temporary living space, really. I don't usually have visitors in here. Actually, never... Thor picks up a sock off the floor. She snatches it from him, puts it away.Can we go outside?I come up here sometimes when I can't sleep. Or when I'm trying to reconcile particle data. Or when Darcy's driving me crazy.I'm glad you're safe.I also hit you with my car a couple times, so it kind of evens out. He grins, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out herI don't believe it... She takes it from him, surprised and grateful.No, this is good. Thank you. This means I don't have to start from scratch... She sits down and opens the notebook eagerly, then stops, a harsh realization clouding her face. Thor notices.SHIELD, whatever they are. They're never going to let this research see the light of day.Why?What is it?That would have been a thousand years ago? Northern Europe?What about you?Erik! She and Thor hurry to his side. He's losing blood, going into shock.What are you doing? What is that? As the stone begins to glow, Thor crushes it. Jane looks on, amazed, as the glowing powder falls upon the piece of iron, dissolving it, heading downwards, until it reaches Selvig's wound. The powder heals his wound completely. Thor looks down the street, sees his wounded friends still lying there, as Selvig sits up in utter astonishment. He reaches through the hole in his shirt to touch his healed flesh.Oh. My. God.Something's wrong.It's gone.Thanks. Jane inserts the flash drive into the device.I know. But if he can't get here on his own... Jane hits a switch on the device. Suddenly, a 3-D HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION bursts to life over the device, bathing the two women in its glow.

So what's this \"anomaly\"\u009d of yours supposed to look like?I recognize those. Think how proud he'd be to see you now. Jane's grin fades to a sad smile.For what?That's your \"subtle\"\u009d aurora?!That's debateable. Put your seat belt on!We still have to get him to a hospital.Immediately, Jane. Jane sighs and nods, regretfully watching the storm EVAPORATE above their heads. A thought strikes her.Jane, we need get him to a hospital. Jane kneels and quickly scoops up a soil sample in the cannister.You expect me to leave you alone in the middle of the desert? Thor turns to the others, frustrated.It's all right, my friend. We're going to get you some help. Selvig touches Thor's shoulder. Thor shoves him off, grows agitated, belligerent.You're in the desert outside the town of Puente Antiguo.Oh, for God's sake... He reaches over Jane's shoulder and hands the Nurse his business card.Here. Let's go. Selvig, Darcy, and Jane head out.We might want to perform a spectral analysis.I flew all the way out here -- might as well make myself useful. This is the offer Jane's been waiting for. She gets up, inserts the piece of equipment she's been working on into a rack-mounted server.She was more than a friend.You don't think this was just a magnetic storm?Meaning? Jane heads over to a computer monitor. Selvig follows.How \"big\"\u009d are we talking about? Jane indicates the footage on the monitor. As the last of the Bifrost cloud disappears into the night sky, there appears to be a blister in space, bulging out in convex and covered with stars.I thought you were a science major.Stars.Is that...?Did you see what he did in there? I don't know if finding him is the best idea.So we're just going to spend the rest of the day looking for him?The Bifrost... Jane starts to get uncomfortable with Thor standing so close to her, looking over her notations. She quickly closes the book.What did the satellite look like?Jane. He pulls her aside. Thor can tell that Selvig doesn't much care for him.I'm not talking about the crater. I'm talking about him.He's delusional! Listen to what he's saying! \"Thor.\"\u009d \"Bifrost.\"\u009d \"Mjolnir.\"\u009d These are the stories I grew up with as a child!It's dangerous. He's dangerous.Now... let's get back to the lab. We have work to do. Selvig and Darcy turn and start to go. Jane looks after Thor as he walks away down the street.Jane. This is more serious than you realize. Let it go.And your back-ups?No one knows much about them. But I knew a scientist -- a pioneer in gamma radiation. SHIELD showed up, and he was never heard from again.Please, let me contact one of my colleagues. Dr. Pym has had some dealings with these people. I'll e- mail him and see if he can help.I'll just be a minute. He climbs out and heads inside. Jane looks down the street and sees something that intrigues her.You've reached Dr. Erik Selvig. Please leave me a message. His voicemail BEEPS. She talks quietly, urgently.Why not?In the children's section. I wanted to show you how ridiculous his story was. Jane is unconvinced by this. She knows he wants to believe.I was talking about science, not magic!Who wrote science fiction.In some cases.Jane...Jane, if you do this, you'll find yourself in a situation that I won't be able to get you out of this time.Doctor Donald Blake. He's part of our team.Troubled, not dangerous. He was distraught when he found out that you'd taken all of our research. It was years of his life, gone! He got depressed, started drinking, and... well, you know the rest.Certainly. The Techie at a computer nearby runs the name.You can understand how a man could go off like that. I mean, a big, faceless organization like yours, coming in with their jack-booted thugs and stealing private property...Steroids. He's a bit of a fitness nut.He is. That is, he was. He switched careers and became a physicist. He's quite brilliant, really.Thank you.Donny, Donny, Donny! There you are! Thor looks up, unsure what the hell is going on. Selvig pulls Thor to his feet, gives him a warm hug.It's going to be all right, my friend. Come on, I'm taking you home.I will!To get a drink. Selvig and Thor climb into the SUV. As they drive off, Coulson turns to the other two agents -- GARRETT and CALE.Seems Darcy's a terrible intern, but a talented hacker.Don't thank me. I only did it for Jane.Of course not! Jane's like a daughter to me. Her father and I taught at University together. A good man, but he never listened. This registers with Thor.I don't know if you're really delusional, and I really don't care at this point. I just care about her. I've seen the way she looks at you.Good. If that's the case, then I'll buy you one more drink, and you'll leave town tonight. A long pause, then Thor nods. He takes a drink.It's not a bad thing, finding out that you don't have all the answers. That's when you start asking the right questions. Thor takes this in.Anyone who's ever going to find their way in this world has to start by admitting they don't know where the hell they are. Thor nods.Gentlemen, please. Let's keep our heads. Just then, Selvig HEAD-BUTTS the Townie, knocking him out. Thor's impressed. Selvig downs his drink, then hurls his glass aside, SHATTERING it on the ground.I still don't believe you're the God of Thunder.I need some coffee. The three head inside Smith Motors.I don't believe it...I'm really starting to like him. Jane turns to Thor to find he's gone.Jane, no! He pulls her into Smith Motors.

It was the rage of battle. How else could I have fought my way through a hundred warriors and pulled us out alive? The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for Thor.Some do battle, others just do tricks. The Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like it. He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand. EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles.Loki... Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered.Now that was just a waste of good wine.You don't really want to start this again, do you, Cow?You're incapable of sincerity.Thank you. The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:Stop. Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear.How do I look?You go ahead. Loki casts him a wary look.I'll be along. Go on. Loki heads inside the palace without his brother.Why does everyone keep saying that? I'm not nervous!...but never you. I know.And what is that?I swear.I swear.I swear.The Jotuns must pay for what they've done!\"All is well?!\"\u009d They broke into the Weapons Vault! If the Frost Giants had stolen even one of theseI want to know why they--And if you hadn't taken it from them they would have laid waste to all the Nine Realms!He just broke your truce! We must act! Odin turns to Sif and the Warriors Three.March into Jotunheim as you once did, teach them a lesson, break their spirits so they'll never dare try to cross our borders again!This was an act of war!They got this far!As King of Asgard, I would--It's unwise to be in my company right now, brother.This was to be my day of triumph.Yes, exactly!It's the only way to ensure the safety of our borders.The safety of our Realm is no jest. We're going to Jotunheim.My father fought his way into Jotunheim, defeated their armies, and took their Casket! We'd just be looking for answers.My friends, have you forgotten all that we've done together? He turns to Fandral.Who brought you into the sweet embrace of the most exotic maidens in all of Yggdrasil?And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors this Realm has ever known?Come on. You're not going to let my brother and me take all the glory, are you? Loki looks startled.You are coming with me...We must first find a way to get past Heimdall.Then tell no one where we've gone until we've returned. Thor walks past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper lets the group pass. Volstagg walks beside the frustrated Loki, needles him.I have no plans to die today.Come on. Don't be bashful. The others join him at his side, then step towards the Bifrost. Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom, changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being elongated by the pull of it. In an instant, they're jerked off the platform and inside the vortex.Come on, big fella. Up...! With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims:Too late now.For what?We know all we must. It's time to act. Thor heads on. Reluctantly, the others follow.It feels good, doesn't it? To be together again, adventuring on another world?What would you call it?How about a song to lift our spirits? The others groan.Hiding. As cowards always do. Thor leads the others onwards towards the central plaza. Loki reluctantly follows. They don't notice as SHADOWY FIGURES move in the shadows of the structures nearby.I speak only to your King. Not to his foot soldiers.And I am--I demand answers. Laufey stands, sizing up Thor, tries to piece this together.How did your people get into Asgard?Do not dishonor my father's name with your lies.Not when you'd use it to make war against other Realms. Laufey laughs, cold, mocking.This boy has grown tired of your mockery. Thor takes a step towards Laufey. The other Jotuns step in front of Thor, blocking his path. We finally see the Frost Giants now -- terrifying, blue-skinned, standing eight feet tall. Loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores him.Know your place, brother...Next! Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun.Come on! At least make it a challenge for me! He sees the Brute coming at him. The huge Jotun lands a tremendous blow, sending Thor back across the ice. Thor rises, grins.Now that's more like it! He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute head over heels. Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies back to his grasp.Ugly and stupid. Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the ground by another. It raises its weapon above her. Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in the chest. The Jotun falls dead.Come on! But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon. Mjolnir falls to the ground. A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the ground, to no avail. Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to leave. From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides it's time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the wall of the palace, and down to the ground below. The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their feet.Then go!I can stop them! The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all around them.Loki, we have to see. Loki raises his arms, concentrates, the mists dissipating. But as they do, the Asgardians see before them the faces of the Frost Giants. And there are HUNDREDS of them -- too many, even for a Thunder God.Now! We'll finish them together!Why did you bring us back?I was protecting my home.There won't be a kingdom to protect if you're afraid to act! Odin stares at him.Whatever the cost, the world must know that the new King of Asgard will not be held in contempt.While you wait and be patient, the Nine Realms laugh at us! The old ways are done. You'd stand giving speeches while Asgard falls!And you are an old man and a fool! The whole world seems to stop at Thor's words. Odin falls quiet. When he speaks again, there's something terrifying beneath the calmness of his words.Hammer...Father! Heimdall! I know you can hear me! Open the bridge!You! What world is this? The group is intimidated by his fervor.Where am I?! Answer me! Darcy reaches into her fanny pack, pulls something out of it. Jane looks on, concerned.What Realm?! Alfheim? Nornheim?You dare threaten Thor with so punyHow dare you attack the son of Odin!Then bring me a healing stone, you savages! He hurls one of them off, smashing against a wall. Now a couple SECURITY GUARDS and MALE NURSES join the fracas, all struggling to hold Thor down. Medical equipment goes flying, furniture overturned.You're no match for the Mighty-- Thor struggles a beat, then passes out.It's not possible. He tries again, mustering all his strength. One of his hands slips free from its restraint.Blue sky... one sun... This is Earth, isn't it?They will suffice. Thor turns his attention to the pictures of the Bifrost on the wall.What does anyone do in the Bifrost? Everyone stares at him. Selvig seems to recognize the word. Jane opens her notebook, quickly writes the word down. Thor moves close to her, eyes the notations and drawings within the book, curious.This drink. I like it.It was delicious. I want another.I just did.I meant no disrespect.You have my word.Where?!Twelve miles east of here. He starts to stride determinedly down the street. Jane walks with him.To get what belongs to me.It's not what they say it is.Yes. He stops walking.If you take me there now, I'll tell you everything you wish to know.All the answers you seek will be yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir. Darcy looks to the others.I understand. Then this is where we say goodbye. He takes her hand and kisses it.Jane Foster... Erik Selvig... Darcy. Farewell. He heads off down the street. Selvig looks relieved.I need a horse.Then give me one of those, large enough to ride. The Pet Store Clerk looks confused. Just then, Thor hears a CAR HORN. He turns to the open door. Across the street, Jane calls to him from the Pinzgauer.Many times. You're brave to do it.But you're clever. Far more clever than anyone else in this Realm.You think me strange? Jane laughs, catches herself.Good strange or bad strange?You'll see soon enough.What you seek -- it's a bridge.More like a rainbow bridge.You're going to need this.Stay here. Once I have Mjolnir, I will return what they stole from you.Deal?No. Jane looks relieved.I'm going to fly out. Before she can react, he starts heading towards the crater. The first drops of rain begin to patter into the dust.You're big. Thor grins.Fought bigger.Just a man.Loki? What are you doing here?What's happened? Tell me! Is it Jotunheim? Let me explain toWhat?Can I come home?But couldn't we find a way to--No, I'm sorry. Loki... thank you for coming here.Good-bye.Thank you for what you've done.Are you in love with her?Neither did I. Selvig eyes him with interest.I swear to you, I mean her no harm.I had it all backwards. I had it all wrong. Selvig watches him keenly. This is a different Thor than he's seen before.For the first time in my life, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.I have no quarrel with you. But she's a lady. You should be more respectful.I will not fight him.Standing there with the unconscious Selvig slung over his shoulder.He's fine. Not injured at all.Sorry, my friend.We drank. We fought. He made his ancestors proud.These are your chambers? Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious. She starts cleaning up the mess around her.You've been very kind. I've been far less grateful than you deserve.It was all I could get back. Not as much as I promised. I'm sorry.What's wrong?You must do this. You must finish what you've started.Because you're right. It's taken so many generations for your people to get to this point. You're nearly there. You just need someone to show you how close you really are.Look -- your ancestors called it magic. You call it science. I come from a place where they're one and the same thing. We recognize that Thor is drawing the branches of Yggdrasil as she looks on, amazed and intrigued.This is how my father explained it to me...You're very welcome. Jane joins them at the card table with a couple more plates. She and Thor sit with the others and start to eat their breakfast, looking like a little family.Thank you. Excuse me a moment. Thor leaves.To replace the one I broke. Please forgive my behavior.If I may, I'd like to come back for more of your \"coffee.\"\u009dMy friends! Thor happily races over and greets his comrades. Jane, Selvig, and Darcy watch the Asgardians from across the room. Jane looks concerned. Selvig and Darcy eye them with wonder.My friends, I've never been happier to see anyone. But you should not have come.You know I can't. My father is dead because of me. I must remain in exile. The other Asgardians exchange puzzled looks.Leave this town now. Get yourself and your friends to safety.I must stay and fight. The Asgardians look to Thor.I'm still a warrior, and I will fight by your side.Help me clear the streets. I'll let none of these people die this day. Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy start to herd the crowd of Townsfolk off the streets, as the Warriors Three and Sif head across town, towards the Destroyer.Come on... give me one! Amidst the useless powder, he finally finds one stone still intact. Thor tosses the pouch aside, holds the stone over the end of the iron rod.Go, while you can!You can't help them now. Your job is to survive. She struggles to sit up.Live and tell those stories yourself. At last, she nods. Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious, with Hogun and Fandral lying nearby. Thor makes his way towards them. Volstagg is barely breathing. Thor tries to pull him to safety, but it's no use. He won't budge. He rouses Hogun and Fandral.But not win. Move Volstagg, or he'll die! Thor looks at them, grins.Don't worry, my friends. I have a plan. The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and drag him away from the battlefield. After they go, Thor turns to back to the Destroyer, then tosses Sif's shield aside. He strides down the street towards the behemoth, completely defenseless.Brother... for whatever I have done to wrong you, whatever I have done to lead you to do this, I am sorry. But these people have done nothing to you. They are innocents. He continues towards the Destroyer.Take my life, and know I will never return to Asgard.Heimdall! Open the Bifrost!He would open it if he could. I fear the worst.Heimdall!Know this, son of Coul. You and I, we fight for the same cause -- the protection of this world. From this day forward, count me as your ally.Whatever fate lies before me, you are part of it. He takes her in his arms, kisses her passionately. Thor and the Asgardians leap into the Bifrost.Get him to the healing room! Leave my brother to me.No thanks to you. Frigga picks up on the tension building between her sons.Why don't you tell her? How you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends? To kill me? Frigga looks to Loki, alarmed and confused.You're a talented liar, brother. Always have been.Jotunheim...Why have you done this?He won't! You can't kill an entire race!I've changed.Is the throne really worth what you've done? What you would become?I will not fight you, brother.Loki, this is madness... Loki grins.Yet still not clever enough. With that, Thor raises his hammer, rising into the air, summoning lightning. A massive bolt strikes Mjolnir, then channels outwards, splitting up, striking each one of the Lokis. All of them dissipate into nothingness, save one -- the real Loki -- who's sent flying back across the Bridge, Gungnir knocked from his grasp. Thor steps over to his fallen brother, lying dazed on his back. Loki winces, prepares for the worst, when Thor steps away. Loki opens his eyes, tries to stand, but can't. He looks confused, then sees what the problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop his chest. Struggle as he may, Loki can't lift it off. He's pinned to the ground. Thor looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing towards Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of energy moving through the Bridge. He's at a loss of what to do. Loki watches him smugly.Forgive me. Summoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow -- KRAKABOOM! The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING out of it. Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the force of the blast. A wave of destruction moves forward along the Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart as it goes. The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART. As Loki and Thor fall together, Thor grabs hold of one end of Gungnir, while Loki still clutches the other. They both fall towards the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out from the broken Bridge. They're an instant from being blasted by the destructive force of the energy, carried away by the current, pulverized by the debris, when --No! But it's too late. Odin and Thor can only watch as Loki falls into the rushing torrent of Bifrost energy. It carries him away, along with the debris of the Bridge and the Observatory, disappearing out of sight. Odin pulls Thor up onto the Bridge. Drained, Thor falls back into his father's arms.There will never be a wiser king than you. Or a better father.Can you see her? Heimdall turns, gazes out towards Earth.How is she?", "clean_line": "known nervous wasn nerves brother rage battle fought way warriors pulled alive attendant approaches goblet wine thor battle tricks

the time in Nornheim...As I recall, I was the one who veiled us in smoke to ease our escape.Just a bit of fun. Right, my friend? The Attendant isn't so sure. Thor dons his EAGLE-WINGEDNice feathers.I was being sincere!Am I? He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost.I've looked forward to this day as long as you have. You're my brother and my friend. Sometimes I'm envious, but never doubt that I love you.Give us a kiss.Like a king. They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN.It's time.He said he'd be along. Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval.I wouldn't worry. Father will forgive him. He always does.Who said I was wise?It will come. In time.But there's nothing we can do without defying Father. Thor considers this, looks at his hammer, a gleam in his eye. Loki can guess what he's thinking, grows concerned.No... stop there! I know that look!It's madness!Nothing! Thor was making a jest!What?Yes, of course! I won't let my brother march into Jotunheim alone. I will be at his side.Keep your weapons sheathed and your mouths closed. This is going to take subtlety and sincerity, not brute strength. Leave it to me. Loki dismounts and steps forward.I'm sorry?You must be mistaken. We're not--Get me off this bridge before it cracks under your girth. Volstagg and Fandral share a laugh.Perhaps we should wait. Thor turns back to his brother.To survey the enemy. To gauge their strengths and weaknesses from a distance.Thor, stop and think. Look around you. We are outnumbered.We will accept your most gracious offer. The others look to Thor imploringly. Thor stares Laufey down a beat -- then relents. He turns to leave. His comrades breathe a sigh of relief and follow, when a Frost Giant nearby mutters under his breath.Damn. In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, swings it, and KNOCKS the Jotun clear across the plaza. The Asgardians reluctantly draw their weapons, gather into a circle around Thor. Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them.Pathetic. He turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from either side. He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at once. Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun BRUTE. The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself up, then punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet. It's a long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior flying back. Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns.That can't be good.Thor, we must go! Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes mercilessly, a man consumed by blood lust. Loki sees the look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat of battle.Likely killed us all! As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them. The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not move, for fear of falling through, into the void below. Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his comrades.I told him.I told him to go to Odin after we'd left. Though he should be flogged for taking so long.I saved our lives! And Thor's. I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did.And if I do, then what? I love Thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is. He's arrogant. He's reckless. He's dangerous. You saw how he was today. Is that what Asgard needs from its King? The others exchange glances, torn. Loki has a point. He leaves the room. Hogun stares after him.Am I cursed?What am I?What more than that? Odin doesn't answer. He looks suddenly weary, burdened. Loki sizes him up, realizes the truth.The Casket wasn't the only thing you took from Jotunheim that day, was it? Odin looks him in the eye. He can deny it no longer.Laufey's son... He desperately struggles to make sense of it all.Why? You were knee-deep in Jotun blood. Why would you take me?You took me for a purpose, what was it? Odin doesn't answer.Tell me!So I am no more than another stolen relic, locked up here until you might have use of me.You could have told me what I was from the beginning. Why didn't you?Because I am the monster parents tell their children about at night?It all makes sense now. Why you favored Thor all these years.Because no matter how much you claim to \"love\"\u009d me, you could never have a Frost Giant sitting on the Throne of Asgard! Odin's body begins to shake, he lifts his hand. It starts to move out of synch temporarily, leaving a trail, the effect of the Odinsleep approaching. Loki doesn't notice as Odin tries to fight it off.Guards!So why did he lie?How long will it last?I never get used to seeing him like this. The most powerful being in the Nine Realms lying helpless until his body is restored.What hope is there for Thor?Sitting sprawled upon his father's throne. He wears his horned ceremonial headdress and holds GUNGNIR in his hand. Sif and the others look up, shocked at the sight before them.My friends... you haven't heard? I am now Ruler of Asgard.Father's fallen into the Odinsleep. My mother fears he may never awaken again.She has refused to leave my father's bedside. You can bring your \"urgent\"\u009d matter to me, your King. Sif covers quickly.My first command can not be to undo the Allfather's last. We're on the brink of war with Jotunheim. Our people must have a sense of continuity in order to feel safe in these difficult times. Sif and the Warriors Three trade looks, not liking any of this.All of us must stand together, for the good of Asgard.I thought he'd never leave. Thor looks up, shocked to find Loki standing there, dressed in 21st century attire.I had to see you.Father is dead. Thor stares at him, stunned.Your banishment, the threat of a new war, it was too much for him to bear. The implications of Loki's words dawn on Thor -- he's responsible for his father's fate. Loki draws close to him, looks in his eyes, consolingly.You mustn't blame yourself. I know that you loved him. I tried to tell him so, but he wouldn't listen.The burden of the throne has fallen to me now.The truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile.Mother has forbidden your return. Thor nods, lowers his head, beaten.This is goodbye, brother. I'm so sorry.Nothing could have stopped me. Coulson enters the room, but seems to take no notice of Loki.Fare well, brother.I've come alone and unarmed.To make you another proposition.You're welcome.You have no idea what I am. The blueness spreads across his face, as Laufey and the guards stare in shock. Loki grins.Hello, Father. Laufey releases him. Loki's body turns back to normal. Intrigued, Laufey sizes up his son.No longer weak. I now rule Asgard, until Odin awakens. Perhaps you should not have so carelessly abandoned me. This gives Laufey pause.I will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers, lead you into his chambers, and let you slay him where he lies. I'll keep the throne, and you will have the Casket. Laufey studies Loki's face.When all is done, we will have a permanent peace between our two worlds. Then I, the bastard son, will have accomplished what Odin and Thor never could.No. Asgard is mine. The rest of the Nine Realms will be yours, if you do as you're told. Laufey considers the proposition.What troubles you, Gatekeeper?Perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service.You have great power, Heimdall. Tell me, did Odin ever fear you?And why is that?Exactly. Just as you're sworn to obey me now. Yes? A beat.Good. Then you will open the Bifrost to no one until I have undone what my brother has started. Loki heads out of the Observatory. Heimdall stares after him.You think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of the Realm? There are secret paths between worlds to which even you with all your gifts are blind. But I have need of them no longer, now that I am King.Ensure my brother does not return.Father. Welcome to Asgard.And your death came by the son of Odin.I swear to you, mother, they will pay for what they've done today. I will end the Jotun threat, now and forever! He looks to Odin.And I will make you proud. Loki savors the moment, but it's short-lived, as Thor bursts in. He's thrown by the scene before him -- Odin safe, Laufey and two Jotuns dead, Frigga regarding Loki with pride and respect. Stunned and delighted to see Thor, Frigga beams.Found its way back to you, did it?It must have been enforcing Father's last command.All these years, and no one's ever dared to use it as a weapon. Thor hurries to the ice, raises his hammer to SMASH through it to get to the controls frozen within. Before he can, Loki fires Gungnir. The blast hits the ice in front of Thor, blasting him back across the floor. Loki steps down from the ice as Thor staggers to his feet.You can't stop it. The Bifrost will build until it rips Jotunheim apart.To do what Father never could. To destroy their kind forever. When he awakens, he'll see the wisdom of what I've done.What is this newfound love for the Frost Giants? You, who would have killed them all with your bare hands.So have I. Loki hits Thor across the face with Gungnir.Fight me. He swings Gungnir at Thor again. Thor catches it in his hand, rears back his hammer as if ready to return the blow, but instead takes to the air and flies past Loki, back towards the frozen controls. Loki spins around, aims Gungnir, and fires a blast which immobilizes Thor in the air. He hangs there, suspended.I never wanted the throne. I only wanted to be your equal. Now fight me!I am not your brother. I never was.Is it? He FIRES Gungnir at Thor. Thor dodges the blast, rolls to his feet.What happened to you on earth that turned you so soft? Don't tell me it was a woman. Thor doesn't answer. Loki laughs, realizing he's right.It was. Perhaps when we're finished here I'll pay her a little visit myself. That did it. Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and their weapons collide. The two battle -- Loki unleashing years of pent-up rage and jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself.If you care so much for the Jotuns, then die with them. The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor's body, trying to drag him away. He's nearly swallowed by the vortex, when he concentrates, mustering his will. He reaches out his hand towards the Bifrost. MJOLNIR flies back through the maelstrom, into Thor's hand. The hammer pulls him free. Loki tries to fire off another blast at him, but Thor takes to the air, speeds towards his brother.Thor! Help me! Thor steps over to the side of the Bridge, sees Loki looking up at him desperately.Please... Loki's fingers start to slip. Thor reaches down to grab his brother's wrist, but his hand passes through Loki's. Just then, the REAL LOKI materializes behind him. Thor whirls around as Loki STABS him in the chest with Gungnir. Loki lifts Thor into the air, impaled on the spear, and hurls him across the bridge.Look at you, the Mighty Thor. With all your strength, what good does it do you now? Thor knows Loki's right. He's powerless to stop what's happening. He looks down at the Bridge beneath his feet, VIBRATING from the force and speed of the Bifrost energy feeding into the Observatory. Then he gets an idea. He realizes what he must do -- and what he must sacrifice. Thor extends his hand towards Loki, summoning Mjolnir. The hammer goes flying to his grasp. Loki looks confused.Stop! What are you doing?! Thor lifts the hammer again, brings it down harder. BOOM! The crack grows bigger. The Bifrost energy starts to stream out from it. Loki thinks fast.If you destroy the Bridge, you'll never see her again! Loki grabs Gungnir, runs towards him, ready to pierce Thor through the back.", "clean_line": "time nornheim recall veiled smoke ease escape bit fun right friend attendant isn sure thor dons eagle
