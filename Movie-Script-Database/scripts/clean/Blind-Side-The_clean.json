{"Blind-Side-The": {"MICHAEL": {"raw_line": "To... investigate.Iono [I don't know]... Investigator Granger sifts through her briefcase, pulls out files, documents - a good bit of evidence for whatever trouble Michael is in. She sits back, stares at Michael, as if trying to figure him out. Michael can't meet her gaze. He looks out the window, rubs his knees some more.Can I... can I leave now?White people are crazy.Can I leave now? She nods and watches him stand and walk away. She glances down at the sheet, turns it over and sees... A DRAWING on the back - a boat on an ocean. On the boat is a single, stick figure person. It's sweet but looks like a third grader drew it.Naw, it's aright. Steven gets in the Taurus. Michael watches it drive away.Here in the cafeteria.A few things.I don't need any. Sean walks back over to Coach Cotton.Iono...Like our \"class\"?They're stuck, not sure if they should talk to this \"stranger\". They jump off the swings and run away.Iono.Gym.._. Sean nods, rolls his window back up and drives as the light turns green.Because... it's warm. This hits her all at once. She bites her lip.Mr. Tuohy sleeps on the couch?Iono.I qot clothes.I don't like to be called Big Mike. She wasn't expecting this, nods her head.Don't get out!Hey, David. David, a little embarrassed to be with Alton, nods back.She wadn't home.She prolly moved to a nicer place.I got your back.Oh, yeah?... Si looks at the Michael's notebook.You don't have to help. I mean if you're busy or somethin'.Not exactly. They all laugh.I don't want to go anyplace else. She's a bit befuddled by the response.It's mine?Never had one before.A bed. We can see this unsettles her. She turns away a bit, trying to contain herself.I think I know that. It's when water...I know that. The little guy, Napoleon was on one side and...What?You own all of 'ern?Is that why Mr. Tuohy don't have to go to work?And y'all eat at those places for free?What do y'all do with the leftover food? At the restaurant?,That's too bad.Why ain't we eatin' at one of yours tonight?Thanks.Marcus.Yeah.He's my brother. Complete silence in the car. Leigh Anne finally breaks it --I don't know where he stays.When I was little mebbe.Hi. Need a push? They giggle and Michael pushes them, one arm each until they're flying high and squealing.Let's go home, play some video games.Iono..Okay... Michael moves to the line. Si raises his whistle and blows.Mrs. Tuohy? Michael stands nearby.Will you help get me something?Driver's license.You have a car.Something to carry. With my name on it. She locks eyes with him. This time he holds her gaze.What?What's that mean?I kinda thought I already was.Tenth grade tough?Yeah.Yeah. After a beat...I'm not that weak, SJ.A compliment for a condiment.Cinnamon just scored.I'll drive. off her look --I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry!I stopped it.Yes ma'am.I stopped it. Leigh Anne points to the offense.What about Mr. Tuohy and Collins?Don't worry, Coach. I got your back. Cotton cools down. Michael trots out onto the field. Halfway there he stops, looks back at Cotton and smiles.Try Gap.Gap.Sorry, Coach. I stopped when I heard the whistle.To the bus. It was time for him to go home. Cotton smiles proudly and slaps Michael on the ass.I don't wanna join the Army. Sean and Coach Cotton crack up.I don't understand it.Big.A brain.Sacagawea?Yes, Miss Sue.Can SJ come?No, Miss Sue.You're kidding?Someone made a mistake?Why would they go ahead if they knew he messed up?They all gonna die, aren't they?That's really, really sad.Courage is a hard thing to figure. You can have courage based on a dumb idea or a mistake, but you're not supposed to question adults, or your coach, or your teacher because they make the rules. Maybe they know best but maybe they don't.It all depends on who you are, where you come from. Didn't at least one of the six hundred guys think about giving up and joining with the other side? I mean, Valley of Death, that's pretty salty stuff.That's why courage is tricky. Should you always do what others tell you to do? Sometimes you might not even know why you're doing something. I mean, any fool can have courage.But honor, that's the real reason you either do something or you don't. It's who you are and maybe who you want to be. If you die trying for something important then you have both honor and courage and that's pretty good.I think that's what the writer was saying. That you should try for courage and hope for honor. And maybe even pray that the people telling you what. to do have some, too. Bob, visibly moved, sets down the essay and smiles.As much as you want?Coach is a good guy.He played basketball.She was a cheerleader.They can't stand Tennessee.No.Miss Sue.What's that mean?To... investigate.Iono... she sifts through her briefcase, pulls out files, documents - a good bit of evidence for whatever trouble Michael is in. She sits back, stares at Michael, as if trying to figure him out. Michael can't meet her gaze. He looks out the window, rubs his knees some more.Can I... can I leave now?What do you want, ma'am?Unto...I didn't lie...No...no...no...Why'd you do it?All along you wanted me to go to Ole Miss.Why did you do this for me?!Everything! Was it for you or was it for me? Was it so I would go to school where you wanted?! Was it so I would do what you wanted?!That's what she thinks! Is she right?! Don't you dare lie to me! Leigh Anne digests this, takes a breath...I'm not stupid! He turns and walks away.I'm looking for Moms.Yeah.Yeah, I heard.She came here?Shut up. Alton steps in front of Michael, raises his hands ---You think the police gonna come and get me?When I was little and something awful was happening, my Mama would tell me to close my eyes.She was tryin' to keep me from seeing her do drugs or other bad things. And she'd say, \"keep 'em closed till I say so.\" And then when she was finished or the bad things were over she'd say, \"now when I count to three, you open your eyes and the past is gone, the world is a good place, and it's all gonna be okay.\"I'm pretty good at it.Every game?You want me to go to Tennessee?What if I wanted to flip burgers? She takes this in, swallows hard andOkay.I'm sorry I left the other day.You ask a lot of questions.But all the questions you asked were about why everybody else wanted me to go to Ole Miss.You asked about everybody but me. You never asked why I wanted to go there.It's where my family goes to school. It's where they've always gone to school. Granger considers this, stares at Michael, then almost, just almost, smiles.Yes ma'am. Leigh Anne gives Sean a look that says, \"let's get on the road.\" Sean offers a hand; Michael shakes it. Collins high fives him. SJ offers a fist; Michael knocks it. Leigh Anne, tearing up, nods and gives Michael a quick hug.Thank you, Mama. Overwhelmed, she turns for the car with a little wave.Why does she always do that?I need a proper hug. She gets out of the car and holds him for a long time.", "clean_line": "investigate iono know investigator granger sifts briefcase pulls files documents good bit evidence trouble michael sits stares michael trying figure michael meet gaze looks window rubs knees leave white people crazy leave nods watches stand walk away glances sheet turns sees drawing boat ocean boat single stick figure person sweet looks like grader drew naw aright steven gets taurus michael watches drive away cafeteria things need sean walks coach cotton iono like class stuck sure talk stranger jump swings run away iono gym _ sean nods rolls window drives light turns green warm hits bites lip mr tuohy sleeps couch iono qot clothes like called big mike wasn expecting nods head hey david david little embarrassed alton nods wadn home prolly moved nicer place got oh yeah si looks michael notebook help mean busy somethin exactly laugh want anyplace bit befuddled response bed unsettles turns away bit trying contain think know water know little guy napoleon ern mr tuohy work eat places free leftover food restaurant bad ain eatin tonight thanks marcus yeah brother complete silence car leigh anne finally breaks know stays little mebbe hi need push giggle michael pushes arm flying high squealing let home play video games iono okay michael moves line si raises whistle blows mrs tuohy michael stands nearby help driver license car carry locks eyes time holds gaze mean kinda thought tenth grade tough yeah yeah beat weak sj compliment condiment cinnamon scored ll drive look sorry sorry stopped yes ma stopped leigh anne points offense mr tuohy collins worry coach got cotton cools michael trots field halfway stops looks cotton smiles try gap gap sorry coach stopped heard whistle bus time home cotton smiles proudly slaps michael ass wanna join army sean coach cotton crack understand big brain sacagawea yes miss sue sj come miss sue kidding mistake ahead knew messed gonna die aren sad courage hard thing figure courage based dumb idea mistake supposed question adults coach teacher rules maybe know best maybe depends come guys think giving joining mean valley death pretty salty stuff courage tricky tell know mean fool courage honor real reason maybe want die trying important honor courage pretty good think writer saying try courage hope honor maybe pray people telling bob visibly moved sets essay smiles want coach good guy played basketball cheerleader stand tennessee miss sue mean investigate iono sifts briefcase pulls files documents good bit evidence trouble michael sits stares michael trying figure michael meet gaze looks window rubs knees leave want ma unto lie wanted ole miss school wanted wanted thinks right dare lie leigh anne digests takes breath stupid turns walks away looking moms yeah yeah heard came shut alton steps michael raises hands think police gonna come little awful happening mama tell close eyes tryin seeing drugs bad things em closed till finished bad things count open eyes past gone world good place gonna okay pretty good game want tennessee wanted flip burgers takes swallows hard andokay sorry left day ask lot questions questions asked everybody wanted ole miss asked everybody asked wanted family goes school ve gone school granger considers stares michael smiles yes ma leigh anne gives sean look says let road sean offers hand michael shakes collins high fives sj offers fist michael knocks leigh anne tearing nods gives michael quick hug thank mama overwhelmed turns car little wave need proper hug gets car holds long time"}, "COTTON": {"raw_line": "What can I do for you, Tony?I appreciate that but I'm not involved with admissions.What sport does he play?Classes start in a week.

Big Tony points out the.window to the playground where Steven and Michael are playing one on one basketball.Big Mike.Mother of God...Are there spots available or not? PAUL SANDSTROM, Principal, taps his fingers before...Big Mike.How bad could it be? Another board member, MRS. SMITH, pores over Michael's file, which is a mess. She finds facts and lays them out ---So they moved him ahead without going to third grade. That says something.Brave kid. For wanting to come here. For wanting a quality education. An education denied him by the poor quality of the schools he's attended. Most kids with his background wouldn't come within two hundred miles of this place.Forget sports! Look at the wall. He points to the crest on the wall. Beneath it: \"NEIGHBORLY,Christian. We either take that seriously or we paint over it. You don't admit Michael Oher for sports, you admit him because it's the right thing to do. Their faces announce that he's made a point.If he makes his grades he'll be eligible in the spring.But boy-hidey, just look at him. Cotton is admiring Michael's size but Sean sees something else. He stands, walks over to Michael, who barely looks up.You could tell that by looking at him?You know how much those things weigh? This kid's gonna make us all famous.Okay, Mike, you fought off the block but you've got to shuck him and make the tackle. You got it?Shuck the blocker, Mike! Michael gingerly sets the lineman on the ground.No! Michael drops back and tries to intercept a pass.No! Michael holds a blocker off him with one arm and looks skyward as a flock of birds flies overhead.No! No! No!Most kids from bad situations can't wait to be violent and that comes out on the field. But this kid, he doesn't seem to wanna hit anyone.What?I thought for sure he was gonna be a player. I can't believe I used up my chits to get him in school.And he won't in the fall if he doesn't improve a lot before then.0her! You've got a hundred pounds on Collis and you can't keep him out of our backfield?!Holding - left tackle! He gets right in Michael's face, grabs his jersey.You can only grab in here -- at the tits, you got it?! You grab out here or here, we're gonna get flagged and I'm gonna get pissed. Leigh Anne grimaces, shakes her head.Move your feet, son! Keep 'em moving! Back to the huddle! Cotton addresses an ASSISTANT COACH...Well at least he'll look good coming off the bus. The other team will be terrified 'til they realize he's a marshmallow.We're in the middle of practice, Leigh Anne!What'd you say to him?On the schedule it says this is a home game but don't be deceived, gentlemen. Three fourths of the people in the stands are here from Milford. They'll be loud and rowdy and a lot of 'em drunk. Keep your helmets on 'til you're on the sidelines. I don't want anyone getting beaned with a whiskey bottle.For we can... Do all things... Through Jesus Christ... Who strengthens us... Each and every day...Oh, one more thing. The reason Milford traveled all that way to come here is they expect to whup your ass. Whup your ass and have a party in your house. Whup your ass, have a party in your house and piss on your mama's new couch. Is that gonna happen? The team erupts with a chorus of NO'.s and HELL NO!s.Let's go 0! The offense runs onto the field and huddles. The Milford defense waits, slapping each other and building to a frenzy. Number 66 from before is the defensive end on Michael's side. Wingate breaks huddle and #66 sees him.Get back to your own bench, 66! 66 laughs and struts away. Cotton goes straight to the ref.Did you hear what he said? Are you gonna just let that kinda talk go?!Look, son, 66 is quick, so just focus on his belt buckle.Where it goes he goes. And block 'til the whistle blows. All right? Michael nods and takes a seat on the bench. Cotton hears something and realizes it is his cell phone. He looks at the number calling. and answers...Hello?...It's all right. Settle down.Ref, you gonna do something about this?! He kicked my boy in the head and cussed him! The Ref throws a flag.Thank you!What happened to the first Amendment?! Cotton throws his hat and another ref throws a flag.This young man plays for my team and I will defend him like he's my own son! Against you or any other redneck sonofabitch! Michael watches, dumbfounded. He walks over to the livid Cotton and pulls him backwards, looks him in the eye.Now what?! Was he holding?Did he hit after the whistle?Then what's the flag for?You're kidding me. The Referee ignores and returns to the field to assess the penalty. 66, now on his feet, limps back onto the field. Michael looks at him and 66's eyes go straight to the dirt. Cotton walks up to Michael.Where were you taking him, Mike?Attaboy, Michael Oher. Attaboy!You're kidding?And you think that could be Michael?Tom Lemming runs the biggest recruiting service in the nation. He practically created an industry.

What would you do without.me?Si, don't let this go to your head but I thought you were very convincing in the role of... uh...And you're Irish. If you weren't the Chief how come you got the headdress? Si hesitates a bit before --What is he wearing? It's below freezing. What's his name again?Where's he going? She gives Sean a look. Sean rolls down his window.The gym? It's nine o'clock. No answer to this. They drive another half block,before --Turn around. Sean sighs, knowing better than to argue.Big Mike, my name is Leigh Anne Tuohy. My kids go to Wingate. You said you're going to the gym? Michael slowly nods.The school gym's closed. Michael takes this in but doesn't respond.Why were you going to the gym? Big Mike?! Why were you going to the gym?Do you have anywhere to stay tonight? Michael eyes the ground, then nods.Don't you dare lie to me.Home.I'd give you the guest bedroom but it's full of sample boxes. And the sectional in the family room slides apart when you sleep on it. At least that's what Sean says.Only when he's bad. There's a powder room right there and we're upstairs if you need us. The two share a look, then...Sleep tight, honey. She leaves. Michael is dumbfounded, stares at everything in the room, then sits on the couch.Was this a bad idea?Don't lie there and pretend you're not thinking the same thing as me.How well do you know Big Mike?Do you think he'll steal anything?If you hear a scream call the insurance adjustor.Up and at 'em. Collins groans. Leigh Anne picks up a few pieces of clothes. on her way out and groans at the mess. We stay with her as she re-enters the hallway, walks and opens the door to --Sean Junior! She opens the shades.Clean this place up before you come downstairs. You hear me? Si crawls out of bed and Leigh Anne exits the room and starts down the stairs, almost afraid of what she'll find.Mike? Big Mike?! Nothing. She hears a DOG BARKING in the neighborhood and moves to the window to look out.Big Mike!Where are you going?Are you spending Thanksgiving with your family? Michael shakes his head.Come and get it! Sean sits at the TV,\"watching an Ole Miss football game, while SJ plays.video games on another. Collins chats on her cell. Michael sits off to the side, taking it all in.As much as you want.Shall we say grace? The Tuohy family plus Michael hold hands. Collins stares at her tiny hand intertwined with Michael's. As Leigh Anne prays Michael tries to emulate behavior without closing his eyes, taking it all in...Heavenly Father. We thank you for all your many blessings on this family. We thank you for bringing us a new friend. And we ask that you look after. us in this holiday season and never let us forget just how very fortunate we are. Amen. A chorus of Amens and they all dig in. Michael is unsure at first how to correctly use the silverware. He picks up the fork and Leigh Anne nods, \"that's right\". She eyes Michael's stained shirt.Big Mike, do you like to shop? Because tomorrow I think I'm gonna have to show you how it's done.You \"have\" clothes.. And an extra T- shirt in a plastic bag does not a wardrobe make. He looks out the window.Okay, fine, let's go get 'em. Just tell me where I'm going. No answer. Frustrated, she pulls the car over to the curb and puts it in park.Tell me everything I need to know about you. He still stares out the window.Who takes care of you?Look, Big Mike, we can do this the easy way - or we can do it the hard way. Take your pick. He eyes the floor.Fine. Tell me one thing I should know about you. One thing!Okay. Mike or Michael? Tell you what, from now on, to me, 'you're Michael. So,... Michael, where we headed?This is where your mother lives? He nods and she opens her door.Okay, let's go. He forcefully reaches across her and closes the door, catching her off guard.Who's going to help you with your clothes?We can come back. Michael takes this in, looks out the window.I've lived in Memphis my whole life and never been anywhere near here. You're going to take care of me, right?That's good to know. Thank you. As they start to walk, Leigh Anne reaches up and takes Michael's arm. He holds it out for her.This is it? If this is all you got why's it say \"Big and Tall\" on the sign?Anything you like?And before you choose something think about yourself wearing it and ask yourself: Is this me?This one? This is the one you like? He nods, completely sure.Have a great day. Learn something! They say a few good-byes, get out and walk toward the arch. Only then do we see what Michael is wearing: a GARGANTUANDon't get your panties in a wad.Any of y'all spent much time on the other side of town?Alabama Street... Hurt Village.You're not far off.Eating an eighteen dollar salad.Do you want to stay here, Michael? He keeps working.Because if you want to... stay... for awhile... longer... I'll try and find some time to figure out a bedroom for you. He stops, turns to her. She walks over, examines the structure of the couch. It sags a bit.I mean, look at this, you've practically ruined a.ten thousand dollar couch. She moves closer to him. Her face softens.Do you want to stay here, Michael?Well,... alright then.I see here on the admission that we're Michael's contact for medical emergencies? Mrs. Smith sits with her.Love that man. Leigh Anne pulls out another sheet, hands it over...What's this?They try to figure out what a kid's going to be in the eighth grade? What does. it say about Michael? Mrs. Smith nods and reads over Michael's results.Which one?Yes, it is sad. So sad. But he either doesn't know it or doesn't think so and it's my job, and your job, to make sure he doesn't find out. Michael Oher doesn't feel sorry for himself and I'll be damned if he starts to because of the way we treat him. \"Darned.\"I had to put half my samples in storage but well, anyway, back there's a desk. Chest o'drawers. Night stand. Lamps. Alarm clock. Bed. Sean says a lot of pro athletes use futons if they can't find a big enough bed. Michael doesn't dare touch anything, just stares in awe.Well, try it out. See if it feels okay. He gingerly moves to the bed; touches it.Yeah. What?Well, you got one now.Isn't that great?I've got a design book I need to get. Sean, go check on our reservation.They might be closed by then.Come on, your dad's already PO'ed. Collins holds up a book. Sendak's WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE.\"And he gnashed his terrible teeth and roared his terrible roar.-Yeah, me too. Leigh Anne sees Michael left out, but interested.Michael, your Mama ever read either one of those to you? He just stares at her, the answer obvious.No one ever...Who was that boy you were talking to, Michael? At the restaurant.He works there?And how do you know Marcus?Well, I'd like to meet him someday. Would that be okay with you?When's the last time you saw him, Michael?\"...and his name was Ferdinand. All the other little bulls he lived with would run and jump and butt their heads together, but not Ferdinand. He liked to sit just quietly and smell the flowers\"...Huh?I don't know. I'm just happy. Really happy.No. It has everything to do with Michael. Sean smiles, kisses her, turns off the light. She snuggles next to him and kisses the back of his neck.I think we should start a charity. For kids like him.Maybe fund a program at Wingate.Are you even listening to me?You knew I was a multi-tasker when you married me. She kisses him and they roll over, laughing.Michael! Come over here and get in the next one. Sean gives her a look like she's crazy.We don't have a single picture with him. Oh, come on. It's not like I'm gonna put it on the Christmas card. Michael moves in behind the family, dwarfing them.Who's winning?Too bad. Who are they playing?Yep. With gusto.Collie-bell, I thought you were going to your boyfriend's?I like that.Look, he's a great kid.He'll be eighteen in a few months. So, I mean it wouldn't make much sense to legally adopt him, right? They realize she's thought about it and stop laughing. After an awkward beat of silence...Before or after he turns over in his grave? Daddy's gone five years now, Elaine, and to make matters worse you were at the funeral. You wore Chanel with that awful black hat. Before Elaine can attack --Look, here's the deal. I don't need any of y'all to approve of my choices. But I do ask you to respect them. You have no idea what this boy's been through.And if this is going to be a running diatribe I can find an overpriced salad a lot closer to home.No. He's changing mine.What about Collins?I've got this. Shame on you. And strides away.Be honest with me now, okay? Collins nods, having no idea what her mother is about to say.Is Michael being here weird for you?What kids?And what do the juvenile kids say?What about you?I can make other arrangements. Just let me know. Okay?... Leigh Anne kisses Collins goodnight.How's he doing?He's Ferdinand the Bull.Nothing.I thought you said it was your Christian duty? He gives her a smirk.I hear \"Mrs. Tuohy\" I look over my shoulder for my mother--in-law. Call me Leigh Anne or Mama or almost anything else.What?Why do you need a driver's license when you don't have a car?That I use to haul y'all all over creation with. He doesn't say anything but doesn't leave either. Leigh Anne puts down the swatches, turns to him..Why do you want a license, Michael?Yes. He lives with us.No.oh... no. The Employee does a search on the computer. As she types...We tried to find one for school, but...How big a problem is this? DMV Employee looks to Leigh Anne.Look, I'll sign something saying he lives with us and we'll pay for the insurance; whatever it takes. What's it gonna take? Off the Employee's look --Don't pretend you didn't hear me.What do you think we're doing? And don't act like I'm going behind your back. I know you put us down as his medical contact at school.And that's another thing. We have to find out more about his past.Not if you use a knife. What if we sent him to a child psychologist?Like vinegar. She moves to him, holds him.At least promise me you'll think about it.\"Alright\" you'll think about it or \"alright\" we should do it?I'm not cutting, just asking.Well I'd have it in shape in two days, I can tell you that.He was first.I'd like to become a legal guardian.What is in there?Where is she? His mother?How many children does she have?We'd need her permission though, .right?So you would give him away without even telling his mother? Ronald shrugs.I'm looking for Denise Oher.Do you know where she might be?No, I can't, but thank you.Hi. Mrs. Oher?No. My. name is Leigh Anne Tuohy and your son Michael lives with me. And my family. Denise takes this in.When did you last see Michael?No, no that's very kind but...Oh, I'm not a foster parent to Michael. We were just helping him out.No.When I can find them in his size.I try to be.What do you mean?Mrs. Oher, was Michael born under a different name? Denise tries to remember. After a few seconds...Where is he, the father, if you don't mind me asking?And when was that?Do you have Michael's birth certificate? Denise sighs, looks around at the mess, shakes her head. And then, unexpectedly, starts to cry softly.It's okay, Mrs. Oher.. I'll figure it out. Leigh Anne walks over, kneels and takes Denise's hands.You'll always be Michael's Mama. Would you like to see him?People lose birth certificates. It's nothing to be ashamed of.Well, what it means is, we want to know if you'd like to be a part of this family? Michael looks to a grinning SJ, to Collins who nods and smiles, then to Leigh Anne...okay, but Michael?... Be careful. Michael smiles and he and SJ get inside the truck.What is going on here?!Well, when you're finished, put the players back in the spice cabinet.Honey, I've got a meeting in ten minutes.This is not a twenty thousand dollar Oushak, Jerry. The borders are different widths, it's been altered. Leigh Anne's phone rings. As she answersWe'll give you nine tops.Michael! He looks up, sobbing.Where's SJ?!He's okay, though, right?Michael, it wasn't your fault. It could have happened to anybody.. He doesn't look up. She almost gasps when she notices -- HIS ARM - red, bleeding, a large burn from the wrist all the way up to the sleeve, which is also singed.Michael, your arm... what happened? He looks up and into her eyes...What's. with the camera?Gimme a minute, Bert.You can thank me later. Bert just watches as Leigh Anne walks straight to the huddle and pulls Michael aside. The other players turn to watch.Do you remember just after we met, and we went to that horrible part of town to buy you those dreadful clothes?If anyone tried to get to me you would have stopped them, right?This team is your family. And you have to protect them -- --from those guys. She walks over and grabs the QB, pulls him out.Tony is your quarterback. You protect his blindside.When you look at him, think of me. How you have my back. How you have his. She grabs BOBBY, a short stump of a running back.oomaloompah here is your tailback. When you look at him think of SJ and how you'd never let anything or anyone hurt him. Do you understand me?I suppose they can be on the team, too. Are you going to protect the family, Michael?Yelling at him won't help. He doesn't trust men. In his experience they pretend to care about you 'til they disappear. Cotton chuckles.. She walks over and sits next to SJ, who has the video camera in his lap.You're gonna wanna get this.You should get to know yourYou ever seen so many rednecks in one place?SJ, eyes forward! Sticks and stones...Come on, Michael!Enough with the trick plays, Bert. Just run the dang ball.Hey crotch mouth! Yeah, you! Zip it or I'll come zip it for ya! Sean pulls her back down to her seat.See number seventy-four? Well, that's MY son.! The Milford fans don't know what to make of this. Leigh Anne sits down with a self-satisfied smile.Kick higher, Collins. Point your toes! Leigh Anne notices Fulmer.What in the world?... Y'all keep practicing.It's Oher. Like a paddle in a boat. Fulmer notices Leigh Anne, grunts then turns back to Cotton.Did you know that to be eligible for a Division One scholarship Michael's gonna need a 2.5 GPA?His ACT is low and I don't see him doing any better if he retakes it.He needs to make A's this year. I'm serious. And that might not even be enough.Most inner city kids that go to JC drop out in a year. His shot at the pros would go out the window.There are twenty more. She holds up a stack of mail - envelopes and Fed Exes.And these. Fifty of 'em.They won't recruit until they hire a new coach. But none of it matters unless he makes his grades.So here's the plan. E-mail me all assignments and let me know what Michael has to do to make an \"A\". There is laughter in the room.Okay, fine, a B plus. And if anyone knows of a good tutor I'd love to hear about 'em.I understand that you applied for a teaching position at Wingate?I appreciate your honesty, Miss Sue.He needs to do better in school.He's in line for a football scholarship if he gets his grades up.He'd better be.When do you want to start?What's that?Yes, Coach Saban, that's me. Leigh Anne. Touhy.Nick, why don't you and Michael go into the living room to talk.I find him extremely handsome.Congrats on gettin' hired, Coach.Coach 0, you're coming a little late to the party but we're diehard Rebels so I'm gonna give you a frickin' road map, okay?LSU is out. Everybody knows Saban's going to the NFL. So when he comes for his visit to Ole Miss, don't take him to some titty bar and give him tequila shots. He'll have nightmares for weeks. Feed him Italian - he likes Fettucine Alfredo - take him to a movie - but not Chainsaw massacre because he'll just cover his eyes - and put him to bed by ten. You got it?It breaks my heart but they're still in the hunt. Fulmer offered SJ a sweet deal.He's his daddy's boy.He needs a B. What's he gonna have to do to \"deserve\" that?That's it. We're sunk.Scanned it off an Internet ad for a toddler boutique. Tell a soul and I'll rip your tongue out. IN THE CROWExcuse me young man, but I think I need a proper hug. He smiles and moves to her. Off their embraceYou'll be living in Deaton Hall -- here. You'll have a meal plan and you'll go to Johnson commons to eat.Hello... This is Mrs. Tuohy... As she listens she gives Sean a look - \"This isn't good\". INT. BUttDING HALLWAY - DAY Leigh Anne walks with Michael.They just want to ask you a few questions. You've got nothing to hide, Michael. They arrive at a door, open it.Please call me Leigh Anne. Leigh Anne shakes her hand and she and Michael move to the chairs.How long will this take?Michael, I'll be outside. Leigh Anne pecks his cheek and exits, giving Michael one last look before she leaves.I've got a bad feeling about this, Sean. This broad is tough. Oh,. Susie's on the other line.Michael, what's wrong? He looks at her, glares really; upset.What?Well, of course, but...What?No, Michael...Michael, look... I can see where, where some people might... Her inability, for the first time, to articulate, hits Michael in the face.Michael?! But she doesn't move, just watches him go.Well if he comes by there let me know. Thanks.Text him SJ.I should have followed him.Was he right? What he said about us?What about the rest of it - all the stuff we did to make sure he got a scholarship? A scholarship to Ole Miss.Did he? Did you ask him? 'Cause I know for sure I never did. Sean considers this, then beckons.Am I a good person? Not a joke. Not rhetorical.Why is that?Sean... what if he never comes back?Michael was here?No, you hear me, bitch. You threaten my son you threaten me. You so much as cross downtown you'll be sorry. I'm in a prayer group with the D.A., I'm a member of the NRA and I am always packing.And it shoots just fine all the other days, too. She turns on her heels and strides to her car.Michael?!!!I'd imagine the last thing anybody at Hurt Village wants is cops snooping around. I swore I'd never ask but... how'd you make it out of there, Michael?You closed your eyes. He nods. She shakes her head, amazed at the kid. They stare out at the street, then...You know, when I was driving all over Kingdom Come looking for you I just kept thinking about one thing.Yeah, you are.But I will not wear that gaudy orange of theirs because it's not in my color wheel.I want you to go wherever you want. It's your decision, Michael. It's your life.Your decision; your life. Michael smiles.Okay, what?College is going to be a different experience for you. There are lots of distractions.There'll always be some nimrod in the dorm who wants to play video games all night, or goof off on the internet.You'll spend lots of time at practice which means you have to be very dedicated to your studies.Thank you, Miss Sue.Michael Oher, you listen to me. I want you to enjoy yourself but you need to know that if you get a girl pregnant out of wedlock I will climb in the car, drive here to Oxford and cut off your penis.The 78'll be a parking lot. We should go. She gets inside and closes the door for privacy.

Up in the corner.He look like a volleyball fan to you? Leigh Anne, loaded up with refreshments, makes her way up the stands to her family. She has a nod, a smile, a bon mot, for everyone she passes. As she sits...Collins got a dig.If he makes his grades.What did you eat for lunch today?I didn't ask where you ate, I asked what you ate.Do you need some money? For lunch?Buy him a semester lunch pass and put it on my bill. He's hungry.I don't know where it is.Lots of things you'll never know about.Or maybe they just thought he'd make a better Chief.Don't laugh too hard. The Quesadilla saved our ass.Hey, Big Mike! Michael stops in the crosswalk, looks to the car.Where you headin'?I've seen that look many times. She's about to get her way. Leigh Anne makes her way back to the car, with Michael in tow. She opens the back door and he gets in next to SJ in his headdress. Leigh Anne climbs into the front seat, closes the door. Sean is looking at her.Where we going?What?Fine, tell me what you're thinking so I can know what's supposed to be on my mind.In case you haven't noticed he doesn't have much to say. What's the big deal? It's just one night. It is just one night, right?.. Leigh Anne?...I guess we'll know in. the morning. He rolls over to go to sleep. Leigh Anne just sits, stares.SJ, Ole Miss is about to score!Looks great, hon. Collins plate is pretty delicately apportioned.Nah. Sean starts to leave, then stops at the door, turns around, sighs and walks over. He leans in over Michael.Let's see...I know. Think of a sentence like a football team. This is a noun here, see? That's like the team name or what they're known for - whether they're a running team or a passing team. And this is the verb. That's what makes 'em go - like a star player -- maybe a quarterback, maybe a running back. And this is an adjective - everybody oohs and ahs over adjectives but they're not as important as verbs.Or kickers. Michael just stares at them.You have no idea what we're talking about, do you?Hey, hey now. I'm working even when I'm not working.Well, we have to throw some of it away. What's already been cooked.Yeah, I'd rather sell it.All right, I will..Because tonight is a special occasion.I talked to Coach Cotton today. Michael's grades improved enough that he can do spring'training for football in March.They'll seat us when we walk in the door. You can get the book after dinner.Now that was a good steak.You're welcome. As the car pulls up everyone walks toward it except Michael who notices something else -- AT THE SIDE DOOR: A BUSBOY steps outside for a smoke. Michael absently walks over.Michael?... Leigh Anne touches Sean's arm, silencing him. They watch as -- Michael greets the busboy. They stand a few feet apart talking. They nod at each other and after a few seconds -- They hug. Leigh Ann is amazed. She's never seen affection in Michael.What?Why are you smiling?Does. this happiness have anything to do with Michael?Oh... He gets the message, rolls over and kisses her on the lips.Happy's good. As their amorous activities continue...Sure, okay.Absolutely...I try to concentrate on one thing at a time.So you root against Tennessee no matter who they're playing?Coupla messages on the machine. She pushes PLAY on the message machine.Easy, Bert. It's only the spring and he hasn't even been through his first practice.Doesn't quite have the hang of it yet.You wanna do what?!Shouldn't we at least talk about it?There's a big difference between paying for a broken arm and being legally responsible for someone. Someone we barely know.He won't talk about it. He's like an onion; you have to peel it a layer at a time.Do you really expect Big Mike ---- expect Michael to lie down and talk about his childhood like he's Woody Allen or something? Michael's gift is his ability to forget. He's mad at no one and doesn't really care what happened in the past. This puts her on her heels.(like he's never heardAlright.Is there a difference?Michael, we have something to ask you.Leigh. Anne and I would like to become your legal guardians.Is that the one you wanted? He just stands there, staring. Sean hands him the keys.Well, hell, take it for a spin. Go on.Michael thinks he's a redneck.So much for home field advantage.What DVD? I didn't send a DVD.Si.Well, he eats a lot.No, no, he's just...Why didn't you fill out the application, Michael?Really?What's his GPA now?Not bad really, when you consider where he started.So he goes to Junior College.Pros? Are we even sure he's gonna get college offers? She walks over to the answering machine, presses \"Play.\"Phil Fulmer, from Tennessee?Any from Ole Miss?So, what do we do?Who'd a thought we'd have a black son before we knew a Democrat.\"Half a league, half a league, half a league onward.\" I love that one.\"All in the valley of Death rode the six hundred\". They call LSU's stadium Death Valley because of this story. Alfred, Lord Tennyson is writing about Ole Miss-LSU.No. It's a great story.\"Forward the Light Brigade!\" That's like the offense. \"Charge for the guns'he said.\" That's the end zone. \"Into the Valley of Death rode the six hundred.\" He knows it by heart and even miss Sue is impressed.\"Forward the Light Brigade! Was there a man d\u00c2\u00b1smay'd? Not tho' the soldier knew someone had blundered.\"\"Theirs not to make reply, theirs not to reason why, theirs but to do and die: Into the Valley of Death rode the six hundred.\"Yeah.I think you just found something to write about. Michael opens his notebook, picks up a pen.Wait a minute. You broke into the principal's computer?Where'd you find a baby picture of Michael?I want you to know something. You'n me, okay?Yep, that's how Mama put on her freshman ten. Leigh Anne rolls up a pamphlet and whacks him hard on her way to answer a RINGING PHONE.Keep it light. Tell him you're gonna take his truck for a spin if he doesn't get in touch. SJ starts texting. Leigh Anne and Sean stare at each other.You had no way of knowing he'd disappear.Leigh Anne, be sensible. We gave clothes to a boy who had one pair of shorts. We gave him a bed. To hell with the NCAA, I'd do it again tomorrow.He could go wherever he wanted, he knew that.Come here, honey. She moves to him. He puts his arm around her, kisses her forehead.You're the best person I know. Everything you do, you do for others.I have not a clue. You obviously get some sick satisfaction from it. She looks at him. There's truth in his words.Just have fun.You're gonna have a great time. I know I did. Leigh Anne gives Sean a look - \"You're not helping.\"Have a lot of fun. Leigh Anne notices their looks.She's an onion, Michael. You have to peel her one layer at a time. Michael walks over to the car, knocks on the window.

They all shuffle over, grab plates, start piling on food. Sean loads his plate and heads back to the couch.Why are we eating in here? Leigh Anne holds out her hands.It can't be that hard.There are different parts of a sentence and you just have to draw lines showing what they do. Sean stops by the refrigerator for a cold drink while he talks on his cell...They're like wide receivers.That Taco Bell. The KFC catty corner. The Long John Silvers on the next block.All you want. It's awesome.Seems like you could give it away or something? You should check into that, Daddy. Leigh Anne and Sean share a look and a smile.Oh, man, you are gonna crush some people! Michael almost smiles, a little unsure.I always liked this one. He holds up THE STORY OF FERDINAND.Tennessee.This is your summer workout sheet. First it says to warm up and get loose. Well, go ahead, get loose. Michael moves his arms around a bit then stops.What about Dad and Mom? 'Cause you see, in our family, everyone's an athlete. Dad was a basketball star, Collins plays volleyball and runs track. Me, as you know, I do it all and Mom,... well, Mom was a cheerleader, which doesn't exactly count but don't tell her I said that.Can I go, too?See, you're the ketchup, here at Left Tackle. On the weakside.it just means there are more blockers on the other side. It's a compliment, really.We're going through the playbook. Michael got moved to offense..Look for Walker Street. That's where we take a left.
