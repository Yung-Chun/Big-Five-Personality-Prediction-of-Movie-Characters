{"Hostage": {"TALLEY": {"raw_line": "No one's going anywhere, L-T. We can talk this guy down.Hey, George? George, don't kill the dog, okay? We don't want to hear a gun go off in there.Where's the guy's wife?Goddamnit, you said we had her. I told him we had her!Pull the dog's name out of your ass. Get the dog's name.I didn't lie to you, George. You scared your wife pretty good last night. We're having a hard time finding her.You and I have been talking for, what, sixteen hours? Keep talking. Is that your dog, too?I know you're hurting. You lose your job, you find out your wife's fucking another guy . . . but don't give up. We'll have her talk to you.George? Come back to the window.George? Leave the dog alone and come to the window.What's the dog's name?Murray!! They're in the house! His wife's in the house!It's really hard, Jane. This isn't the way I want it.I need to work out some stuff.I still see that boy's eyes.Is Amanda there?Can we talk some more when you get here?What are you talking about, shot? What happened?Where are they?Sonofabitch.Are civilians inside?Holster your guns!Mike! Mike, can you hear me?Don't shout, Larry. I'm three feet away.We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.Keep your head down.How you doing, buddy? You still alive?Jesus. You hang on.He's in the backseat!This is Talley. Who's on?One at a time! Clear the air! Louise? Talk to me. What do we have?Quiet! I want radio discipline. Mike's hanging in. Larry, Jorgy? Listen up.Find out who lives at four-five-five. We gotta know who's in there.Did he say if she was shooting at him?Then we don't know if she's part of this or not. Mickey, you up?Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders. You see it?Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that. Put a unit out there.That's not enough.Get everyone out here. Then call the Sheriffs. Tell them we have a possible hostage situation.That would be the girl who opened the door. Are the others inside?Louise?Get a phone number for the Smiths.Go, Mickey.Contact the landlord. I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.News hawks. There'll be more. They monitor our frequencies.Everyone be cool. That's our job right now--stabilize the situation and don't let things get out of hand. All we have to do is hang on until the Sheriffs take over. That's all we have to do.That's my job, Metzger. That's why I get the big bucks.My name is Jeff Talley. Is this Dennis Rooney?The Bristo Police Department. Look out the window. You see the car?We had an awful lot of shooting. You need a doctor in there?Let me speak to Mr. Smith. I want to hear it from him.How about your two friends? You don't have a man dying in there, do you?All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house. Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation --Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis. He died.Dennis? I want you to release those people.We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.Has Dennis done time?Who's this?Have still prints made from the tape. Show the landlord. Maybe we can get a fast ID.Here on his head. Is that a tattoo?Says...burn it.He's watching Kim die.Just around the corner and up that street. See the helicopters?I should've called. This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place? I'll meet you there as soon as I can.I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.Jane?I'm scared shitless.I have the only number that can call into the house?Way to go.Mr. Dill, these pricks didn't know what they were going to do until they did it. I want you to take a look at something.Can you identify this man?Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek' through DMV and NCIC. Tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier.Is Krupchek an aggressive guy? Hot- tempered? Anything like that?You have his address?Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant. When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.Louise?Call Jane for me. She's at the little Thai place.Tell her I'm almost home.I'm Talley. Who's in charge?I've got fourteen officers on my department including me. We're as secure as we can be.Don't crowd the house. The alpha's a kid named Rooney. He's amped up and volatile.I've done it once or twice. I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.Whatever you want.Who's that shooting? Martin, what's going on?They're too close! I told you not to crowd him! Pull back your people; do not breach that house!This thing good?Then get your men off the wall! You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath! I know this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.Look out the window, Dennis. We are NOT entering the house. We're pulling back.It's over now, Dennis! Don't hurt anyone.No one's coming in. A couple of guys out here got carried away.It's over. He's cooling off.I'm here.That's not going to happen, Dennis. They won't give you a helicopter.The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed. There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us. I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?Hey, Dennis? Can I let you in on a personal secret?I gotta piss real bad.I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox. You talk to him for a while.He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs. The whole place would go up.That's why you get the big bucks, Captain.Go.You have her cell number?They might be at the house. Keep trying and let me know. I'm going to be here a little while longer.Did you find Jane and Mandy?What's wrong with the radio?Stand by.Is something wrong with Jane?It's a crank, Louise. C'mon, don't waste my time with that!Put him on.Get Martin. Right away.This is Chief Talley. Tell me your name, son.Slow down, Thomas. Take it easy and talk to me. Was your father shot?How about you and your sister?Where are you right now?That's on the second floor. Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?I've got the boy on the phone. He's using a cell phone. What was that, son? I didn't hear you.Thomas? Thomas...?He says that his father's hurt.They have security cameras. Rooney would see you coming.No. He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.You want me to stick around, I could --Jane? If you're there, pick up, okay? Mandy?Take it easy.I'm the Chief. I don't carry it.Who are you?What do you want?What is this?You can let go.Marlon and Al....I can't control what happens. The Sheriffs are running the scene.You want . . . Marlon and Al.These disks . . . where are they?I'm going back to York. Have Larry meet me at the front gate.I want you to run this license plate and phone number. Then I want you to find out everything you can about Walter Smith.Go back to the office. Run his name through the FBI and the NLETS database. I think he's involved with illegal activity or he associates with people who are.Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs. You understand me, Larry?Fuck guessing. You keep your mouth shut.Get to work.I'm re-assuming command of the scene.And now I'm taking it back. We're getting Smith out of the house.I changed my mind. That's all you need to know.The one and only. We got a little problem out here, Dennis.I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.We can't forget it. The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead. They think you murdered him.If you don't let me talk to him, they're going to attack the house.Help me keep them out! Let me speak to Smith, Dennis. Let me speak to him right now.Talk to me, Dennis. Help me help you. Why can't you put Smith on the phone?Now I understand. That helps. I can make them understand that.Let me come get him.If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.You've already helped yourself once, Dennis; be smart again. If you save his life, it'll help when you get to court.Bring up the ambulance.Okay, Dennis, we won't approach the house until you've closed the door.Easy....Let's do it.How's he look?No.I'm the chief of police here. I have to talk to him.Smith! Wake up!Wake up, goddamnit. Who are you?Use smelling salts, give him a shot, whatever. I just need a minute.Stop the fuckin' engine!Just one question. Please.I want you waiting in Smith's lap. I want to know the second--and I mean the second--that he wakes up.Talley.What'd you find out?Dead end--it's a clone. What about the Mustang?You get anything on Smith?Keep trying.Call me. If you're safe, call me.Put him on.The doctors are taking care of him right now. Thomas . . . are you safe? Can you talk?I need your help with something. But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.Your dad has two computer disks. They have funny names: Marlon and Al.I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office. Could you find them and see who they belong to?I thought they locked you in your room.Can you get into the office?If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?I'm looking for you. I need your tactical unit.Don't question me, Captain! This is my crime scene!I'm a negotiator, Captain. I negotiate. That's all you need to know. Now are you going to help me or not?Okay, bud, here we go.Captain? Kill the lights.Come on, Dennis. Talk to me.I'm unarmed. I'm looking at you. Get out here and let's talk.Only if you try to grab me. We could've shot you from the wall.You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.Give up.The man you sent to the hospital is a criminal. He has partners. This is their house and their money and they want it back.Give up, Dennis. Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.Can you open them?Look for names. Does it say whose taxes they are?Try Al. See if you can open Al.Who is it?Sonny Benza. Oh, fuck.Leigh? Metzger, answer me!Put a guard on Smith! I want you with Smith until I get there!Get in the car. Now.I'm posting a guard outside his room, but we'll need help from hospital security.Not with my officers here, no, ma'am.They're still in the house.I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police. So far as we know, your children are okay.I need to talk to him. Alone.Sonny Benza has my wife and daughter. He wants the disks, Marlon and Al. He took my family to make me help.He's going to kill you. Don't you know that? He can't take the chance that you'll talk.Another minute. Please --Do you think I'm going to let you murder someone?!I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the real FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!! And I've got Smith! I've got Smith!!I guess we do.Your phony FBI assholes.What do you mean by that?They here now?Yeah.Are all of you named Jones?You used to be a cop. All of you used to be cops. I can tell by the way you move.How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.What?Special Agent Jones.What are you people going to do?What does he have on you? I know why I'm doing this, but what does he have on you?Let it go, Captain.It's mine. Talley.Go, Mickey.Mickey? Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.We're getting those kids out of there.We've got to get those kids out of there!Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath! He kills people!Talley.You do what you have to do; I'm getting those kids.The kids are in here!Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks later!Thomas! Thomas, it's me!Stay close. We're going to move fast --Are the disks still in your room?Smith.Yes.A man has my family. Gold watch here. Dark tan.How do I reach him?Two words: Glen Howell.Mr. Jones is dead. So are two of his men. The other three are in jail. I have the disks. I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker? I have you.I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza. Ask if I can keep it.My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family. We'll trade.I think you got no choice.Yeah.Police!Where's my family?! Where's my family, you fuck?!You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?You said they would be here!Jane?You get the other one when I have my girls. Not talk to them; have them.Close.First my girls. I get my girls, you get the other disk.I'll kill you! You won't get the other disk!I love you.I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the real FBI. This one's a fake.I'm a cop, you asshole! What did you expect me to do? Pretend all this never happened?Benza's over. You're over.

Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?That's fifty hundred-dollar bills. Five grand. They got money in this house, Talley, more than you've ever seen.How much would it be worth to you, getting me out of here?Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.There's a million dollars in there, maybe two million. I'll give you half.It ain't been a good day, Chief.I shouldn't have told him about the money. Now Talley is gonna keep it for himself.If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash. That's how we'll stay alive.The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it. He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.
