Walk me over.It's only a garage, come on.Hey, one of my streamers is gone! It probably fell off in here.That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.Come on, it's fun.Hmmmm, interesting.You have no personality.Never mind.Yes.It's my mother.No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.What?I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?You never cared before.Why?Can I go too?Here.Sorry.Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.Pacifist!Bed wetter!We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.Duck!Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.Go???BINGO!We can go now.I felt Justin's hangnail.I don't think I'm allowed to.Hi.Sorry.Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?Are they ready yet?When?When??Hey Shelly, like seafood?See food!I like my name.Are you here to take Shelly back?He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.Does he love her?Do you like her?Why?Really?My Dad was funny?Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh.Carnnk yu sheeee ik??Can't you see it?It's there.Dr. Welty, are you sure those are yours?As good as can be expected.What?What?So?Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!What do you want it for anyway?My mood ring!

I can't breathe!Wanna go tree climbing Thomas J?His face hurts, and where is his glasses? He can't see without his glasses! Put his glasses on! Put on his glasses! He was gonna be an acrobat.Get away, get away!!Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.Mr. Bixler, I love you.I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.No he wouldn't, I can't go home.Who's that?No....Get away from me!I should have told Thomas J that he was my best friend.Shelly, I stole some money from your cookie jar, to pay for the writing class.I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.I will I promise.Goodnight.Did I kill my mother?The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.I found this.In the garage.What was my mama like?Really?Do you miss her?I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.Daddy, it's not so bad to be like you.Mrs. Sennett.I will, I promise.Mrs. Sennett. Thomas J will be all right, my mother will take care of him.I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.Weeping willow with your tears running down, Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if you forever part, But I know he'll always be in your heart.Hi Judy.", "clean_line": "right

"Vada would you bring down my cigarettes?Did I tell you, he was my woodshop teacher.Yeah, I made a tie rack.Vada, just put 'em on the stool.Ya, that rack holds six ties.Vada, we're trying to work here.Hand me the canula.VADA!I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't sing. All right Arthur, just a slide of the needle.....One nice model C-501 bronze stainless eternal journey, yeah, you look like a champion.How may I... Help you?Oh yes.I think it's still available.Uhh, Miss devoto...Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.Yes they are.Deceased.Ahh, excuse me a second will you? Hi George, this is a twelve-fifty-eight, I didn't want the burnished handles.Just put it back in the display room fellers.They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.Of course not.Short people, very short people.Pardon?Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....Oh, she's just pretending. Vada, get up here and eat your broccoli!That's a lot of money for a little girl.Any more soda left?Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.I love this guy!What?Ahh, maybe next summer.Uh huh?Yeah.This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm. Fix it.What do you mean??Oh that, she just likes to play.She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.Oh Hi, what can I do for you?Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.I wrote that.I prefer it to \"instead\", it has more dignity.It's no big deal.I haven't been to the movies in AGES.I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.Nothing, I'm dressing.HEY! WATCH THE HAIR!! THIS SHIRT GIVES!!! ALL RIGHT!!!!I'm very nervous.The last date I had was twenty years ago.Oh come on.Are you sure about all this?Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?Goodnight Vada.Ahh, I just wanna look nice.Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.She likes to play bingo.Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep Grammoo company.Don't worry, there's a strategy to bingo. For instance, on a given night anybody can win, but I play the odds, when choosing bingo cards, I use a range of theories from the laws of probability to avoiding duplicate number systems. This way you get much more activity.No. Just, more activity.Hi Carl.What's that?Why d'you think these seats were empty.Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.Oh, how do you mean?Hey fellers fellers, it's just a bingo game.I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.Okay, sure.It's nice.Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.Yeah.No, why?Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was.....Here?Is there enough room?I haven't danced in.....Rock?At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot date, I did a killer frugue.Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.Want to what?Yes.I ahh, better go.Goodnight Shelly.I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.Lettuce, watch out for the rust when you get lettuce.I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.Not at all. Lot of potatoes!I'm looking forward to that.HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.Really?Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all. I don't know what's gotten into her today.That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!Okay.No, sweetie, not yet.Soon honey, soon.In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.I'll second that.Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?Shelly?Danny?Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.It's her home! It's where she lives!!Danny.....Who are you?Oh then you'll probably be visiting us here quite often.Because if he ever tries to take Shelly's camper again, I'm gonna bury him in my front yard.Is it really your camper?You can get the general idea...Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...Did you ahh, love him?Vada is that you?Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.Shelly's coming with us.I know, I know, let's go on the \"sit on the bench and rest\" ride.Watch you don't knock out a fish.I don't know which ball's mine.Vada we have some good news, Shelly and I are getting married.We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.I fall asleep at the wheel.Vada, keep your hands on the wheel!!Careful Vada, careful.Shelly LOOK OUT!I'm so sorry, it's all right ma, I'm very very sorry.Grabs Vada by the shoulders Now what were you thinking, huh? HUH???? It's your responsibility to watch her!! Do you have any idea how upset those people are in there???!Hi Vada.What are you doing.Is that the fish you won at the carnival?He's getting big. Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.No sweetheart, you can't.He was allergic to bees.There were just too many of 'em.Ahh, Reverand Miles.The funeral's starting.I know that, but what do you want from me?Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.Thank you Arthur.He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!Vada wait! Vada! Vada!!What??No, no.No sweetie that wasn't your fault, things like that aren't anybody's fault, it just happened.I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me. Seeya in the morning.Mrs. Sennett, how are you doing?Oh she's doing much better.

Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet. All right, open your eyes.Does it make it easier to win?Oh great!Aarrggh.I just had a terrible thought Harry.I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.Kinda like men.You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.I had a good time tonight.Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.Home sweet home.I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush.Are you mad at me?I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...What happened to her?Did she ever see Vada?Dance with me?This is where we are.In ages, I know, me neither.See, you're not that out of touch. You're good.What are you wearing?Do you want to?Kiss me.Good.Good at kissing, and dancing, I'm very optimistic.It's only eight o'clock.Goodnight.Well, I guess it's official we had a date, maybe we can play bingo again sometime.Goodnight.Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.How's it going chef?Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.Uh huh, why?That's attractive.Oh shit!

We used to be married.Ex...ex, ex...Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!Stop it! That hurts!!Bye Ralph.Well, you were pretty great!Can we see it from the back yard?Pointing upwards Look...I would never marry anybody I didn't love.So Vada, what's your favorite ride?I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine.They were!! \"Popular Mechanics\", no \"Popular Science\". I don't know, popular.Oh look they're trying to hit that poor thing.Perfect.Oh great!!Oh Vada, that's a gorgeous goldfish.Vada we have something to tell you. Harry?Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?Oh bumper cars, oh you can't go to a carnival and not ride the bumper cars.Oh great Vada, come on...Uhh, two. I got the blue one!!Yes!!I am gonna get you.Vada, Vada, what's the matter?Well he just left, what's wrong?What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?Vada, did this happen in the bathroom?How old are you?It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk.It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.Knocks Vada?Hi.Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.Sure.Bye.Vada? I see you took your tray in,She won't come out. It's been a whole day. You have to do something Harry.Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, \"if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.\"I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter.It's dark, she can't be alone in the dark.We, no, we've been looking since this morning, her teacher called, and he said that she went there first.....But I....Vada. Are you okay? Oh God.I'm sure he knew.It's okay sweetheart.I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.Okay, get in to bed.Goodnight.She's in.", "clean_line": "available hope licensed cosmetologist worked years dino raphael salon customers cried told leaving wonderful disposition people right ease dead stiffs add said makeup artist yes hello oh excuse job need job ohh oh sure big deal clients eventually die clients alive common okay mr sultenfuss got deal promise ll good care people deserve dead ve got left looks excuse harry finished mr layton hair kinda looked harry wrong winning know vada shouldn let girls upset want piece chocolate thomas chocolate chocolate ooh pretty ring wearing maybe black means happy think fine writer ask dad know ask vada vada happened come sweetie excuse harry look mrs porter yeah like think looks nice lips gloss sensual quality eyes needed little definition hair sorry wears hairdo anymore wanted past old school marm image harry wondering wrong vada night dinner think think confused death harry think hi sure ll royal tour uh huh liverpool ohh right like soda thomas oh shouldn looking little old uh huh love romance fun read divorced married people live bottle soda mouth hmmmph gurgle gurgle guess secret hiding place particular putting away rainy day bye miss vada head sure okay excuse harry sorry wanna let know flowers delivered room set shouldn stick nose people business like vada sure hi wondering oh right right bader lorenzo died june devoted husband nicolette cherished father babritzio heidi lieu flowers send donations holy names society kidding oh good lieu love word lieu lieu instead contest learn complement movies movies ahhhh love story drive cried eyes love going movies especially drive think romantic going drive ll let work okay hi vada girl gotta look best tried come sit blot look think looks real nice yes vada think pretty ve got great big sparkling eyes cutest little nose amazing mouth ll come close eyes wanna bring gorgeous color rule applying eye makeup wear blue eye shadow uh huh ve trying hollywood years makeup stars haven gotten right open eyes easier win oh great aarrggh terrible thought harry gonna putting makeup people soon oh lucky harry kinda like men room men like room man exactly want good time tonight like come house minute home sweet home read magazine article maximize small spaces look bathroom want people curious like happens flush mad know tonight little cool opening car doors happened vada dance ages know touch good wearing want kiss good good kissing dancing optimistic clock goodnight guess official date maybe play bingo goodnight hey thought recognized hi vada yeah mind tag shelly famous potato salad know gonna th july picnic long time going chef rub dub dub thanks grub yay god uh huh attractive oh shit excuse danny hi ralph oh danny _i_ bought _i_ paid ve living year camper voice boss watching god guess ll introduce harry phil grammoo vada sultenfuss danny ralph dino raphael salon detroit married ex ex ex honestly harry got mustang promise danny real _bonehead_ thing stop hurts bye ralph pretty great yard pointing upwards look marry anybody love vada favorite ride think roller coaster agreed bad stomach know vada watch eat remember time went carnival cousins david frank ate hot dogs day came nephritis doctor know day high fevers faces got fat baffled medical science magazine popular mechanics popular science know popular oh look trying hit poor thing perfect oh great oh vada gorgeous goldfish vada tell harry vada like goldfish oh bumper cars oh carnival ride bumper cars oh great vada come uhh got blue yes gonna vada vada matter left wrong mean hemorrhaging vada happen bathroom old okay come upstairs little talk actually beautiful thing look wouldn vada believe day ll feel differently knocks vada hi yes upset seeing maybe ll feel better couple days sure bye vada took tray won come day harry open eyes years old friend world dead stop hiding harry run harry came idea working dead people exactly thrill saw family lived thought living family work maybe ll invited supper asking stop feeling people life isn death harry ignore living especially daughter dark dark ve looking morning teacher called said went vada okay oh god sure knew okay sweetheart ll tell dedicate book ll forget thing okay bed goodnight"}}}
