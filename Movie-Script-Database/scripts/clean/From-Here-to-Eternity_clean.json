{"From-Here-to-Eternity": {"MEDIUM SHOT": {"raw_line": "A small thin soldier in an undershirt and fatigue pants backs out of the screen door and into shot. He is wielding a frayed broom. This is PRIVATE ANGELO MAGGIO. He is violent and funny and sour and friendly. He sees Prewitt's legs but not his face, speaks as he sweeps a cloud of dust off the porch.The Dayroom has a pool table, ping-pong table, a radio, etc. Moth-eaten, upholstered chairs line both walls. The place is empty as Prew enters. He looks around casually, sees the pool table in an alcove. He moves over to it, puts the bugle mouthpiece in his pocket, picks a cue from the rack on the wall. He switches on the light, chalks the cue.as Prew and Warden enter. Maggio is sweeping the room. MAZZIOLI, a bespectacled, intellectual-looking Private First Class, is at the clerk's desk, opening it, taking out papers, etc. Prew sits on a bench as Warden goes over to Mazzioli.During this shot Maggio can be seen in b.g. through door to Orderly Room. He pretends to be sweeping, but stops now and then to listen.as Prew and Warden enter and walk through. Maggio bobs his head approvingly at Prew.as Warden jumps in. He takes off his rain hat.The kitchen is small and undistinguished. Karen takes a whisky bottle from a cabinet, pours a straight, stiff drink, puts it on the sink. Warden puts the papers down and drinks. Karen sits on a high kitchen stool.The bugle is heard over shot. A line of spruced-up men stretches through the mess hall. A blanket is spread over a table and behind it sits Holmes, flanked by Warden and Mazzioli. In front of Holmes is a pile of greenbacks and a cigar box filled with silver. He is paying out the man at the head of the line.as Prew enters behind Mrs. Kipfer. The vestibule has an old South feeling of mustiness and respectability. Maggio is handing some bills to ANNETTE, a young, brash-looking girl, who sits behind a reception desk.The jeep is driven by an enlisted man. Sitting next to him is MAJOR GENERAL SLATER. Galovitch hops off the bike and he and Prew snap to attention. General Slater leans out of the vehicle. He seems puzzled and interested by the odd sight of the two men.Prew and Galovitch are standing in front of the Captain's desk. Prew is at attention, the heavy pack on his back; his face is drawn and tired; his clothes are plastered to him. He has regained his old expressionless look. Warden has swung his chair around and is surveying the scene. Holmes looksas Prew carves out. Choy's is on a wide road across from the entrance to the Post. Prew looks around for Warden, sees him off to one side. CAMERA MOVES WITH Prew as he goes over to him.Tall pale royal palms contrast with thick dark plants and bushes. An ornamental lamppost alongside a walking path a little distance away. Prew comes into shot cautiously, carrying Maggio's tie and shoes. He moves quickly, bends over. CAMERA PANS AND MOVES IN and we see it is Maggio's shirt and trousers which Prew has discovered on the ground. He looks at them wryly, picks them up, moves on.Prew and a group of G Company men, including Sergeants Dhom, Thornhill and Henderson, are on the steps and porch as a Reconnaissance car pulls up and halts.as the Recon pulls out and Maggio's last hearty shout drifts back.as the MPs march Maggio up to a door and gesture him to enter alone. He goes in.CAMERA SHOOTS from behind a man seated at a desk. Prominent in shot is a wicked-looking chopped-off hoe handle lying on the desk. Maggio enters, recognizes the man. He walks, up to the desk, his face set in defiance. Music is rising in a fearful crescendo. CAMERA PANS just enough to REVEAL desk sign reading: \"SERGEANT OF THE GUARD.\" The man stands up and the music stops abruptly.The small house is perched precariously on the very edge of the cliff. Alma and Prew come around the bend, come up to the door, Prew marvelling at the house.The porch is at the rear of the house, leading off from the living room. It is on the very edge of the cliff. Prew and Alma are dancing to the music of a portable victrola. It is playing \"Why Don't We Do This More Often?\" A table still contains the dinner plates. Prew's expression holds the wonder of a child at a magic show. He misses a step, stumbles.Holmes, seeing Prew is now clearly in command, steps out of the crowd and up to the two fighters.Holmes pulls himself together, turns to the crowd.Three men come out of the barracks, lean over the porch rail, listening. Their faces are thoughtful, sad.There are eight or nine men here now, listening.A half dozen men are sitting on the steps, listening, among them Stark and Wilson. Stark shakes his head sadly.Fatso is on his back, his stomach gushing bloods his eyes already glazing. Prew staggers into the light now. His left side has two vicious cuts; he is bleeding badly. He stares down at Fatso, who manages a small, reproving voice.Prew comes toward camera, laboriously struggling up the road. His side is hemorrhaging steadily, his shirt and trousers blood-soaked. He stops close to camera. He wads his handkerchief, sticks it inside his shirt near the knife wound. He smiles wearily, crookedly.FEATURING Warden at the NCO table. He rises, carries his plate with him towards the chow line. A sudden, deep-toned, earthquake-like blast shudders through the room. The cups on the tables rattle. Warden stops, cocks his head. The men stop eating, look at each other.Some of the men continue to crane at the sky. A few pick up metal links from the Jap bullets.The men rush for cover, all except Choate who is left alone in shot. He takes a big bite of his sausage and eggs, hastily downs a swig of coffee. Then he throws the plate and cup into the street and dives for cover as the terrifyingly loud noise of the Jap planes indicates they are directly overhead.The non-coma are arguing violently with Leva at the door to the Supply Room. Jap planes are loud overhead.as Warden runs in. Broken glass lies all over the floor. Bullet holes are stitched across the top of Warden's footlocker. He throws back the lid fiercely. His linen is polka-dotted with holes. He tosses out shirts, shorts, etc., digs underneath them. He pulls out a quart bottle of whisky; it is untouched. Warden smiles with relief. He lifts the bottle to his lips, drinks long and heartily.as the men on the roof reload. In the distance the Jap planes have turned and are heading back for the roof.The men flatten, all but Warden. He stands, swings his BAR toward the plane. CAMERA IS ANGLED so that Warden is silhouetted against the sky as he fires at the Jap plane.Prew rises, staggers away from the jeep.", "clean_line": "small soldier undershirt fatigue pants backs screen door shot wielding frayed broom private angelo maggio violent funny sour friendly sees prewitt legs face speaks sweeps cloud dust porch dayroom pool table ping pong table radio moth eaten upholstered chairs line walls place prew enters looks casually sees pool table alcove moves puts bugle mouthpiece pocket picks cue rack wall switches light chalks cue prew warden enter maggio sweeping room mazzioli bespectacled intellectual looking private class clerk desk opening taking papers prew sits bench warden goes mazzioli shot maggio seen door orderly room pretends sweeping stops listen prew warden enter walk maggio bobs head approvingly prew warden jumps takes rain hat kitchen small undistinguished karen takes whisky bottle cabinet pours straight stiff drink puts sink warden puts papers drinks karen sits high kitchen stool bugle heard shot line spruced men stretches mess hall blanket spread table sits holmes flanked warden mazzioli holmes pile greenbacks cigar box filled silver paying man head line prew enters mrs kipfer vestibule old south feeling mustiness respectability maggio handing bills annette young brash looking girl sits reception desk jeep driven enlisted man sitting major general slater galovitch hops bike prew snap attention general slater leans vehicle puzzled interested odd sight men prew galovitch standing captain desk prew attention heavy pack face drawn tired clothes plastered regained old expressionless look warden swung chair surveying scene holmes looksas prew carves choy wide road entrance post prew looks warden sees camera moves prew goes tall pale royal palms contrast dark plants bushes ornamental lamppost alongside walking path little distance away prew comes shot cautiously carrying maggio tie shoes moves quickly bends camera pans moves maggio shirt trousers prew discovered ground looks wryly picks moves prew group company men including sergeants dhom thornhill henderson steps porch reconnaissance car pulls halts recon pulls maggio hearty shout drifts mps march maggio door gesture enter goes camera shoots man seated desk prominent shot wicked looking chopped hoe handle lying desk maggio enters recognizes man walks desk face set defiance music rising fearful crescendo camera pans reveal desk sign reading sergeant guard man stands music stops abruptly small house perched precariously edge cliff alma prew come bend come door prew marvelling house porch rear house leading living room edge cliff prew alma dancing music portable victrola playing table contains dinner plates prew expression holds wonder child magic misses step stumbles holmes seeing prew clearly command steps crowd fighters holmes pulls turns crowd men come barracks lean porch rail listening faces thoughtful sad men listening half dozen men sitting steps listening stark wilson stark shakes head sadly fatso stomach gushing bloods eyes glazing prew staggers light left vicious cuts bleeding badly stares fatso manages small reproving voice prew comes camera laboriously struggling road hemorrhaging steadily shirt trousers blood soaked stops close camera wads handkerchief sticks inside shirt near knife wound smiles wearily crookedly featuring warden nco table rises carries plate chow line sudden deep toned earthquake like blast shudders room cups tables rattle warden stops cocks head men stop eating look men continue crane sky pick metal links jap bullets men rush cover choate left shot takes big bite sausage eggs hastily downs swig coffee throws plate cup street dives cover terrifyingly loud noise jap planes indicates directly overhead non coma arguing violently leva door supply room jap planes loud overhead warden runs broken glass lies floor bullet holes stitched warden footlocker throws lid fiercely linen polka dotted holes tosses shirts shorts digs underneath pulls quart bottle whisky untouched warden smiles relief lifts bottle lips drinks long heartily men roof reload distance jap planes turned heading roof men flatten warden stands swings bar plane camera angled warden silhouetted sky fires jap plane prew rises staggers away jeep"}, "PREW": {"raw_line": "Hello, Maggio.I transferred out of Fort Shatter.That's what the orders say.Prewitt. Transfer from Shafter.I heard about you, too, Warden.That's true.No trouble, sir.It's a personal matter, air.I dint have no trouble if that's what you mean.It was a personal matter.All right. I was First Bugler at Shafter for two years. The topkick had a friend who transferred in from the states. Next day he made him First Bugler over me.No, sir.Thank you, sir.I'm sorry, air. But I quit fighting.I just stopped, sir... After -- Maybe you heard about what happened...That's why I decided I would quit, sir.They don't.No, sir. I dint say --I don't want it disbanded, sir. But I don't see why any man should fight unless he wants to.I'll take my chances.Who's she?I know where I stand. I don't believe that's the only way a man can get along.A man's got to make up his own mind and go his own way. It he don't, he's nothin...Okay.I told you I quit fightin! I'm through! An that's all she wrote: You guys want to put the screws on, go ahead. I can take anything you hand out!Thanks.Never better.What's the deal with him, anyway? I can't figure him.No cook ever used that many panel Not even for an officers, banquet, ladies invited! Want me to grow couple more arms?!What makes you think I mind it?I don't mind it, Top. It's a great life, this. I find a pearl, I'll cut you in. Fifty-fifty, If you hadn't put me here, I wouldn't have had no chance to find it.Thanks, Top, I've had it. You give it to me Tuesday. Remember?That, too. Yesterday.If you think you can push me into fightin, Warden, you're wrong. Not you and Dynamite and The Treatment. I'm twice the man you are. If you dint have them stripes I'd take you out on the green and beat you to a pulp.You'd like that. You could get me a year in the Stockade for that one, couldn't you?Robert E. Lee, RA 345071.I feel the same way, sir.Because he is.Mrs. Kipfer, ma'am, I give you my solemn word your future will be safe with us.Say, what do I get for it?I got it.Oh... sure.Lorene...I dint know about this place till now. A friend of mine brought me. We're stationed at Schofield.Well, I am. And I'm in for the whole ride. I'm a thirty-year man.There ain't anythin wrong with a soljer that ain't wrong with everyone else.Me, too. I mean when I came in. I saw you over here --Friend of mine. You wait right here for me, will ya?Come on, Angelo, come on --Who is he?Hey, I thought you were gonna wait.No. Nothing. Not a thing.Yeah? But then we got mountains. You know anything about mountain climbing?No. You know anything about flying an airplane?Well, I can't fly either. What do you know about deep sea diving?Yeah, I noticed that, too --How's the surfboard rider?I was jealous.What do you dames want? To take the heart out of a man and tie it up in barbed wire?Yes, it's important. Maybe we seem all alike but none of us is ever all alike. All right, I'm sorry about before.Are you mad?Because if you're still mad I'd just rather we called the whole thing off.How come?They did. Ten thousand of them.You like it much?No. Sure not. I mean, why should you?No. I don't like weakness. But I like to drink.Get outa here!That was nice before. The way you snuggled up. In front of him.Some of the guys puttin me over the jumps because I won't fight.On the boxing team. I don't want to fight! I don't want to talk about it! I don't want to think about it. And they make me think about it. Every day.It's a personal thing...Over at Port Shafter... I used to fight... Middleweight. I was pretty good. I used to work out with Dixie Wells. He was a light-heavy, but he was fast... And good. He loved boxing. He was gonna come out of the Army and go right into the upper brackets... People on the Outside had their eye on him. Dixie didn't want, to use the six ounce gloves this time. And we neither of us wore headgear, anyway. I was set flat on my feet when I caught Dixie wide with this no more than ordinary solid cross. Dixie just happened to be standing solid, too.From the way he fell I knew. Dead weight, square on his face. He dint roll over. He was in a coma a week. Then he finally came out of it. The only thing was that he was blind... I went up to the hospital to see him. Twice. Then I couldn't go back. We got to talking about fighting the second time. And Dixie cried... Seein tears comin out of those eyes that couldn't see...It ain't the reason I'm in.That's right. Look at Karelsen there. Only seven years more for rockin chair money.They got Truckdrivers' Blues... Sharecroppers' Blues... Bricklayers' Blues... We oughta have a Soljers' Blues...I got it. We call it the `Re- enlistment Blues'!Lookit, w e could start it with the guy getting discharged. Hey, fella, can I use this?How's this? 'Got paid out on Monday... Not a dog soljer no more... They gimme all that money....'Clean it up yourself!You heard me -- rub your own nose in it a while!Yes, sir. But I have never liked being spit at, sir. Even by a non- commissioned officer.I don't think I owe him no apology. In fact, I think one's owed to me.No, sir, I'm not.I know it. I'm not complainin to nobody. They ain't goin to get the satisfaction of seein me squirm.Only my reglar turn.Whadda they want? They done everything, now they look me in a box! What else they gonna try?When you gonna learn to play a bugle!?... That was a near thing.They can kill you but they can't eat you, Top.I thought --How about Dynamite?... Lorene...Alma...No, honest, I like it. Alma's a -- swell name. It was great you gettin away today.There's no tellin when I'll get into town next. The Warden gave me a break this time. But Holmes and those others, they got me on the edge. I just about went off the deep end the other day.Hate the Army...?It's not the Army that's doing it. It's Man. I love the Army.When you love something it doesn't mean they got to love you in return.No! A man loves a thing, he's gotta be grateful. (pauses, gropes forI landed in jails. I didn't belong nowhere. Until I entered the Profession.The Army. I enlisted at Fort Myer and I learned how to box and I learned how to play a bugle. I never had much call for the boxing - - but if it weren't for the Army I'd never of learned how to play a bugle.This is the mouthpiece I used to play a Taps at Arlington.(as if saying \"I wasLook.

Maybe we won't get in.Is that you, Angelo?Maggio, you nut. Get up. Wake up.Here's your clothes.Boy, are you drunk!You'll get worse than that scraped - - Listen!Come on before you're in trouble --Shut up!Now you done it.I'm sorry, Angelo. It's my fault. I SHOULDA --I shoulda stopped you somehow ---- If I dint get to see you once in a while The Treatment would've cracked me long ago.We could have taken a cab. Except I ain't got cab fare.She'll be great for Maggio when he gets out of the Stockade. He'll be crazy about her because she's so tall.Hey.This is just like bein married, ain't it?I never caught on to dancing much.I been wanting to tell you a long time now -- I love you.I mean it. I need you.A thirty-year man is movin all over, goin all the time. Up to now I never thought a thirty-year man had any business to think of gettin married.Yeah. Must be the altitude.Why's it funny if a guy wants to marry you?Okay -- I'm a private no class dogface soljer. And the way most civilians look at it, that's two steps up from no thin.Lissen, I ain't think in of now. But I got a plan cookin in my head. You want to go back to the States in a year. Well, you could stretch it some, make it two years. And I could swing a Sergeant's stripes -- If I were a non-com the Army'd let me pick my duty when I re-enlist. (lost in the picture ofI could fight.It I go out for boxin he'd send me to non-com school. The Regimental Championship is next month. I bet I could win the middleweight even without training. I used to be pretty good I could do it.This'd be worth it.Okay. But that ain't the real reason.What's the real reason you won't marry me?Well, that's the top I could ever do for you --Proper?(bitterly disappointed butYou got guts, Alma. I hope you pull it off.No. Nobody ever lies about being lonely...You just get out of the Stockade?You see Maggio?He's a good boy.Why don't he go to the C.O.?You think he's gonna be all right?Get outa my way, Ike. I ain't gonna move around you again.All right. It's gonna be your way.You guys figure this means I'm steppin into a ring, you're wrong.(finishes long swig ofWhy you called Friday?Back to Choy's.

I heard about you.Well, put up that cue and come along. This here's a rifle outfit, Prewitt. You ain't suppose to enjoy yourself before sundown. The Man's very particlar about little things like that.Mazzioli! Grant went to the hospital yesterday. Did you make up his sick record? Did you make a note for the morning report?! You're the Compny Clerk. The lousy Sickbook is your job!Thanks. I already done it for you.Ten-sh-HUT!New man here, sir.Who? Me? Whv, yes, air. You had Corpral's stripes in the Bugle Corps, Prewitt. You took a bust to buck Private to transfer to an Infantry Compny. Why? Because you like to hike?That's up to the Compny Commander's discretion to decide.And you asked out on account of that!?His feelings were hurt! Kids they send us now!Yea, sir! The Compny Pond Report's got to be made out. It's due TOMORROW --No, sir!He'd strangle on his own spit if I weren't here to swab out his throat for him. Come on. I'll show you the Supply Room.(one of his unexpectedWhen you turned down Dynanite Holmes' boxing squad? You put your head in a noose. Things are soft for a boxer in his Compny. Otherwise, you better know how to soljer.This ain't the Bugle Corps -- this is straight duty.Since when is this place gettin to be the Royal Hawaiian?His wife. Captain Holmes'.You'll fight, Prewitt. You'll fight because Captain Holmes got a bee in his hat he needs a winnin team to make Mayor. And if you don't do it for him you'll do it for me. I only been in this outfit eight months myself but I learned one thing. My job is to keep him happy. The more he's happy the less he bothers me and the better I run his Compny. So we know where we stand, don't we, kid?Maybe back in the days of the pioneers a man could go his own way. But not in our time, kid. Today you got to play ball. You got to divide it all by two.Lava! Can't I once walk by this Supply Room and find you workin with both hands!Draw some supplies for this man. That's G Compny barracks over there. Get rid of your bags and come back here, and Leva'll find you a cart to lug your stuff over in. Save you makin four five trips.I just hate to see energy wasted. Any kind. Besides, you'll be needin yours.Captain Holmes just went in town, ma'am.No, ma'am, I don't. Is there anythin I can do for you?Yes, ma'am.I couldn't help it if I was born smart, ma'am.One what?I've seen better.Hello, kid. Everythin nice and comfy?'at's the lull before the storm, kid. Set yourself.Chow's almost over, men. Better hurry up and wash. `less of course you'd rather go in the way you are.Yes, sir.I've been considering it.It'll be here when you get back.I am wet.And if I'm not looking for him?Well, I'm looking for him. Do you know where he is?I got some papers it's important for him to sign. Today.I never like to disturb a man drinking.I could use a drink myself right now. Bad. Anyway, I got a faint suspicion the Captain's `in town.' Ain't you going to ask me in?No she won't. Thursday's her day off.I try. In my position you have to.Yes. But not important they get signed today. Tomorrow's okay.I got carbons of those back at the office. So it won't be much work to fix them up.It's not confidence. It's honesty.I figgered out one day it was the shortest distance between two points.No -- it's just that I hate to see a beautiful woman goin all to waste.You're going to cry.Please don't cry... I can't stand to see somebody cry.I'm leaving. Isn't that what you want?I know a beach near Diamond Head. Nobody ever goes there. The cars on the highway pass above and they never know it's there. You feel like you used to feel when you were a kid, hiding by yourself in a cave, watching the others hunting you.How about Payday?I just like to have some on me when I take out a woman. Can you get away?I'll be in Kuhio Park. Say, nine o'clock. Payday.You look awful tard, kid.I didn't say you minded it, kid. I just said you looked tard. Drawn to a fine edge.Well, well, there's a man for you. I'll see if I can fix you up with a lot more since you like it so much. How you like the garbage detail?(nods, as if justYou got a better memory than me. Guess the best thing to do is leave you right in the kitchen a while, huh?Course if you was an ath-a-leet you wouldn't have to pull KP. Or any fatigue duty for that matter...Don't let the stripes worry you, kid. I can always take my shirt off. Take it off right now.Don't throw it, Prewitt. It might break on my head. And that would cost you one thin dime next Payday.Prewitt.Why not? I'm not late.Maybe I'd of been early too only I stopped to get a drink.Would you rather it'd been the cocktail lounge of the Royal?(sits beside her on theDidn't you?What makes you think I'd think that?Listen, what started all this, anyway? Why'm I shakin inside like a school kid out with teacher! Where'd I come up with a yen for of all things the Compny Commander's wife! And her actin like Lady Astor's horse all because I only got here on time!Funny. I got one in a U-Drive-It parked around the corner.Just so long's you melt afterwards.Nobody?Not even one? Out of all the many men you've been kissed by?I wouldn't know. Can't you even make me a rough estimate?No, I forgot to bring it.Maybe I already know.Why? Is there something to hint at?Maybe I do. Maybe there's been a long line of beach parties --Am I? Listen, baby, maybe not here. But what about when you and Holmes were at Fort Bliss?Only it's true, ain't it?All what story?Listen.Listen. Listen. Please.The hateful, miserable --Listens Listen to me --Yes, sir.Too bad you got to lose a middleweight like that...I don't know... But even if he only gets three months, he'll still be in the Stockade when the boxing finals come up.How about just giving him a good stiff Compny punishment for now?Yes, sir.I'm sick of it! They ain't got no right to keep breakin it off in that kid! Sooner later Holmes is going to hound him right into the Stockade!I'm through! I'm turnin in my stripes. I mean it, Pete. I could transfer out tomorrow. In Grade -- get that? To half a dozen Compnys in this Regmint!Where you going, Little Sir Echo?Hurry up. Let's go over to Choy's for some beer and tear up all the tables and chairs.The last time I heard it you told it different.Nobody's gunna do nothin! Anybody's killin anybody around here, it'll be me!No it ain't! This man's in my Compny an I'm responsible for him. And you ain't makin two weeks extra paper work for me by killin him. Nor him you. Put that knife down!Put it down!Killer! You unweaned punk& Come on, you want some killing, come on! Come on, barrelbelly. Ain't you comin?Killers! You'll get plenty of killing, all right. More than you got the stomach for. You'll be in a war one of these days. When you feel that lead from a sniper's rifle hit you between the eyes, come and tell me how you like it. Killers! Now put down that chair.Throw that knife on the floor.Almost scared there wasn't anybody going to stop you for a minute, weren't you? Is there any other little things you punks'd like me to take care of for you?... Yeah.You keep it, kid. Keep it for a souvenir.You ain't enjoying life much, are you, kid?Prewitt.Could you stand a weekend pass?You thought what, kid?Leave Dynamite to me. He signs most anything I put in front of him `thout readies it.I hear you gone dippy over some dame you met at the New Congress Club.What'd you say her name was?Pretty name.What you hangin around here for?What man? I can't stand to see people restin themselves. I'm eccentric. If you ain't got no work maybe I can scare you up some.Whyn't you go on over to the Day Room, shoot a little pool?I'll let you know when the word comes through.Compny G, First Sergeant Warden speaking... Yes, sir... Yes, sir, I will... I'll have his things in order... Yes, sir.He got it. Six months.Believe it or not -- Chicago, Illinois.She said it's over -- time to go HOME --It'll work out...I know.If there were only a way! Your lovin husband'd probly give you the divorce. But even if he didn't know what for, he'd never let me transfer.What!You sure made a thorough study of it.An officer! I've always hated officers.Okay, suppose I did it. -- And don't think it's a cinch -- the exams are tough. Then you'd be getting your divorce here while I'm in the States. We'd be apart maybe six months! We'll probly be in the war by then --Put it down on your calendar. On October twenty-third, 1941, Milt Warden told you we'd be in the war in less than a year.You're crazy! I wish I wasn't in love with you. Maybe could enjoy life again.At first! You were tough and solid as a rock -- and now you're a whining crybaby --I've never been so miserable in my life as I have since I met you.I wouldn't trade a minute of it.I'll probably make the lousiest officer they ever saw in this Army.Thank you, sir.No! I ain't want to see it! Nor you either! Get out of here!I am off duty. Off duty if I want to get plastered --Quiet! At ease! Fall out! Right dress! `bout face! Hit the track! Garbage Detail! Latrine Detail! Dis a drill, not picnic! Hello, kid. Whatever you doin out all by yourself?Siddown. I got a bottle.I hand it to you, kid. They called off The Treatment this afternoon. When you beat up Ike. I never heard of no soljer before ever lickin The Treatment... (drinks; then holds outThis is a terrible crummy life, you know it?What if a truck or somethin was to come along and run over us?An nobody to even mourn. You better not sit here any more. You better get up and move over to the side of the road.I'm old. Don't matter if I die. But your life's ahead of you. You get up.We'll stay together.(as if to an invisiblePrew, I got the biggest troubles in the whole world.Take love. Did you personally ever see any of this love?You'll unerstan, then... This girl, see, she wants me to become.An officer. Can you see me as an officer?You both can see more'n I can. You know what, Prew? I'm scared become an officer.Yes, I am. I tell myself diffrnt but it's a fack. Where'd I be as an officer? How could I handle him? That's the one thing I'm scared of... be an officer in the U.S. Army. Army of the U.S.How's your girl? Wha'st that name again?Oh, yeah, I remember. Lorene. Beautiful name.What you doin with that jeep, Sergeant Stark?My friend Prew and I sittin here discussin the weather.Don't you know you got to look out for this man. Get him off the road before you run him over. He's the best stinkin soljer in the Compny.He's dead.He's dead, Prew.One non-com was missing, sir. Sergeant Galovitch.In the kitchen?I think the Company Commander made a wise decision, sir.Compny G, First Sergeant Warden speaking.Yes... Yes, I know... Yes, the - uh - parcel has already arrived... Yes... What?... No. No, we'll have to talk about it soon. Right away. I - I don't know...Lissen, I'll get away somehow, tonight. I'll meet you in Kuhio Park. At eight... Right....I wanted to -- I tried -- but I couldn't...Lissen -- there's a kid in our outfit named Prewitt... Robert E. Lee Prewitt... He came in from the States about a year ago. I thought he was a fresh punk at first... until I got to know him a little. He's AWOL right now -- probly in some kind of real trouble -- he ain't the kind to go AWOL otherwise. Anyway, I keep remembering somethin he said to me the first day he came in. He said a man has got to go his own way... if he don't, he's nothin... I'm an Enlisted Man. I'm a First Sergeant. Milt Warden. Once I cross that line and tried to be an officer, I'm somebody I don't know. A stranger. And a man has got to be what he is...We're not saying good-bye -- we'll figger out a way for you to stay HERE --Lissen, two people who love each other just don't stop loving each other! Nothin and nobody is goin to break us up l 1111 transfer out somehow and get back to the States. Maybe it'll take a little time but I'll do it!Put it down. Put it down that on December 6th, 1941, Milton Anthony Warden told you he'd remember you...This ain't jawbone! This is for record. Theme real bullets that guy was usin. Get inside -- all of ya!Help him over to the hospital.All right, all right, you men! Quiet down! Quiet down! It's only a war. Ain't you ever been in a war before?We're gonna organize a fire umbrella defense. I want the non- coms to get BARs and ammunition from the Supply Room and get up on the roof. Henderson, you're in charge of the loading detail. Get movin!Okay. It's your life.The rest of you guys - the CQ will unlock the rifle racks. Every man get his rifle and go to his bunk and stay there. And I mean stay there! I'm making each squad leader responsible to keep his men inside. If you have to use a rifle butt to do it, that's okay, too.You heard me! This ain't no maneuvers. You go runnin around outside you'll get your ears shot off. You want to be heroes, you'll get plenty chances later. You'll probly have Japs in your laps before night.You hear a bomb comin, you're free to take off for the brush. But don't worry -- the Japs'll probly drop all their bombs on Pearl Harbor and Hickam. They ain't gonna waste `em on us. So let's can the chatter. We're wastin time. Squad leaders, get `em upstairs!You stick in the kitchen and make a big pot of coffee. No -- make a barrel of coffee.Whatever you say, Pete.Gimme them keys!What's the matter? You blind? You see them planes --?!Okay. Chief, bust the door down. Get the hell out of the way!Go ahead. Bust it down. He'll get out of the way.Okay. I'll see you get a medal.You'll catch a cold, Turp.You better put your pants on.-- Don't worry about wasting ammo! Throw your empty clips down into the yard. The loading detail will pick 'em up --You got him, Pete! You got him!Well, he ain't got no business here. We're takin care of this sector!He's at Headquarters, sir. I'm the First Sergeant.Yes, sir.Yes, sir.It's the mouthpiece of a bugle.Sir, this man was a good soldier.

Good morning, men. Anything special this morning, Sergeant Warden? I've only a few minutes.Oh, yes. Bring him in.At ease. (takes papers out of drawer, glances throughPlenty of room for advancement for a man who knows how to soldier. But he's got to show me he's got it on the ball. I don't know what you've been used to in the Bugle Corps, but in my outfit we run it by the book. What kind of trouble were you in over there?What made you transfer out, then?Oh. I see...Something you wanted to ask, Sergeant?I've got a mighty sour Company Bugler here... but I suppose you wouldn't want that job.Well, we'll get your stripes back for you, maybe an extra one for good measure. You know why you were sent over here when you requested transfer?My Regiment got beaten last year in the finals, as you know. But I mean to win this year. And I will. All I've needed was a top middleweight. Next year I'll hang your picture up there with the others, my boy.Yes, it's too bad about that. I can understand how you feel. But those things happen in this game. A man has got to accept that possibility when he fights.But on the other hand, look atit this way. What if all fighters felt like that?Would you have us disband our fighting program because one man got hurt?You might as well say stop war because one man got killed. Our fighting program is the best morale builder we have off here away from home.It looks to me like you're trying to acquire a reputation as a lone wolf, Prewitt. You should know that in the Army it's not the individual that counts. If a man wants to get ahead he has certain responsibilities to fulfill that go beyond the regulations. It might look as though I were a free agent, but I'm not. Nobody is.Maybe you'll change your mind. In the meantime just don't make any mistakes in my outfit. I've got to go into town. Is there anything else for me today, Sergeant?You make it out. Is that all?Well, whatever it is, you fix it. If there's anything that has to go in this afternoon, sign my name. I won't be back.I'm sorry I'm so late. And about dinner, I ---- I got tied up with General Slater. Bumped into him at the Officers' Club.Success, he said. Success in war, success in peacetime... And not a word about my promotion... There are times I think the Old Man's just waiting to ship me down... I've had a bad day all around...started right off this morning... trouble with a new man...I had some business to attend to in town. During the afternoon.Now what does that mean?How many, times do I have to tell you I haven't any other women before you'll believe me?That again. How long will it be, I wonder, before I'm allowed to live that down? After eight years, how many times do I have to tell you It Was An Accident?I didn't say that. I know what it's done to you, but --I won't be back in time to take Retreat. Or Reveille either, probably.(strides back and forth;(bending over, tyingYou ought to get out more yourself, Warden.Well, I'm going.I'm leaving it in your care, Sergeant.-- this man Prewitt's been here over a month now. I expected you mend have him around before this.Maybe he needs a good dose of The Treatment.You understand. I don't want any rough stuff.But we all know good athletes make good leaders. And good leaders ---- and just see you don't drink all this up in one place.Have you given any thought to the boxing team recently, Prewitt?What's this man's pay?What's the matter with you, Prewitt? You know better than to talk back to a non-commissioned officer.I think you owe Sergeant Galovitch an apology.Sergeant Galovitch, take this man to the barracks and have him roll a full field pack, extra shoes, helmet and all, and then take a bicycle and hike him up to Kole- Kole Pass and back. And see that he hikes all the way. And when he gets back, bring him to me.I take it you're ready to apologize to Sergeant Galovitch now.Take him back up there again, Galovitch. He hasn't had enough yet.1 know that kind of man! He's an againster. A bitter-ender. You can't be decent to a man like that. You have to tame him, like an animal! Warden, I want you to prepare court martial papers. Insubordination and insolence to an officer.Why? Do you see any other way of breaking him?All right, all right. But throw the book at him.-- I've known about it for a long time! I've sensed it. And I'm not going to ignore it any longer! I want to know where you met him and just who he is.You can't keep a thing like this HIDDEN&One thing I know. I know it's a civilian. You'd be too discreet to pick an Army man.It is my business! I'm your husband! What do you think a scandal would do to my chances for a promotion? So if you're thinking of a divorce, you can forget it!Now -- how does it feel to know you'll have to live with a horror like me the rest of your life?You don't know how a man feels about a thing like this. It breaks a man all up -- inside.It's -- it's just not the same.Why do you think I've done all I have...?Tried to be a Company Commander when I hate it, worked my fool head off with this miserable boxing squad, tagged after the General whenever I could.Why, for you and for me. For our home, that's why.At ease, Sergeant. What's the matter?There's no rush. I'll take care of it.All right. Let's cut it.What started this?You won't disobey any more orders in my Company, Prewitt. Warden saved you from a court martial once but he won't this time --Thornhill, you're in charge of this detail. How about it?That's all. Break it off. Let's get back to our jobs. (to Prew and Galovitch;I haven't any, sir... The charges -- are true.If there were any way to avoid a court martial, sir. Any way...--- that's right, it's a letter of resignations I'm through! I've already been relieved! So you can begin packing. We're sailing for the States next week!Where has it gone, Karen? What happened to it? The gay, cheerful life we were going to have, you and I...?

Of course, He was to have left some things for me. That he was to have purchased. Do you know anything about them?He's been telling me quite a bit about you lately. My husband. He says you're very efficient.What is it that makes you so efficient, Sergeant?I love that. Well, good-bye, Sergeant.It doesn't matter.Yes? What did the General have to say?If you'd spend less time buttering Generals and more time with your Company, maybe you'd get that promotion.I went over there this morning looking for you.From the way you look I gather your business wasn't too successful.Dana. Give me credit for a few brains.What right?That makes it all right, I suppose!You know I hate to talk about it!You had a way of knowing, Dana. I want to go to bed. Please get out of my bedroom.Oh. If it isn't Sergeant Warden. You better step inside or you'll get wet.If you're looking for my husband, he isn't here.He still isn't here. If that does you any good.I haven't the slightest idea. Perhaps he's in town. I guess it was `in town' the way you put it, wasn't it? Or perhaps he's at the Club. Having a drink.I'll try phoning him at the Club for you.What is it you want, Sergeant?You're taking an awful chance, you know. My maid is liable to be home any time.You think of everything, don't you, Sergeant?(goes to sink, picks upThat's what I like about you, Sergeant. You have confidence. It's also what I dislike about you.Honesty? How did you acquire such an old-fashioned virtue?Well, he's clever as well as virile.Waste, did you say? Now that's a subject I might tell you something about. There's we. And then there's waste. Positive and negative. The negative is sometimes more interesting... more evil. For example -- what about the house without a child? Tell me your thoughts, Sergeant.Not if I can help it.What are you doing?I don't know, Sergeant. To be honest, I don't know.Maybe... why not?You don't have to spend money on me, Sergeant.Maybe.Why, hello. I didn't think you were coming.No, I guess you're not. But then I came a little early. I must have been overanxious. You weren't overanxious though, were you? You got here right on the dot.You certainly chose a savory spot for our meeting.No, but I've had five chances to be picked up in the last few minutes.Well, I don't care for it. I never went in much for back-alley loving.You probably think I'm a tramp, don't you?Don't try to be gallant, Sergeant. If you think this is a mistake, come right out and say so.On the other hand, I've got a bathing suit under my dress.I hope the ocean's ice cold. I hope I freeze in a solid chunk.I love the way you laugh.Nobody ever kissed me that way... not really...No. Nobody.Well, that will take some figuring. How many men do you think there've been?Not without an adding machine. Do you have your adding machine with you?Then I guess you won't find out, will you?What's the matter? What are you hinting at?I don't know. Maybe a lot. Or maybe you just think there's a lot.You must be crazy -- !I had to go and forget you were a man -- with the same rotten filthy mind the rest of them have. For a minute I had to convince myself you were different --Yes, it's true! A part of it, some small part of whatever sewage you've been listening to. Some day perhaps you'll get all the story.You're getting to sound so much like a typical male. So you just sweat it out like a typical male.All right. I've never told it to anyone before. But I think now is the time. I'll tell you the whole bloody messy thing. You can take it back to the barracks with you.I'd been married to Captain Dana E. Holmes two years. Only he was a First Lieutenant then. Back at Fort Bliss. We lived right on a little lake where we could fish and swim and be alone, our 'dream cottage'... I'm sure you must be able to picture it. It was off on a back road, four miles from the highway. Two miles from a neighbor and a telephone.... I hadn't been married long when I knew my husband was stepping out on me. But -- you get used to that. Your mother tells you that it's life, that i t happens to a lot of women. Of course, she doesn't tell you until after it happens.Then, by that time, you're pregnant. And at least you've something else to hope for. I think I was almost happy that night the pains began. Even though they were weeks too early, a whole month too early. I remember Dana was putting on that dapper silk gabardine uniform he used to wear. He was going to an officer's 'seminar.' He was kidding me about false labor. I didn't think it was humorous. I told him to get home early, to bring the doctor with him. He smiled tenderly and told me about the psychic reactions of women to pregnancy. But never fear, he'd be back early. And maybe he would have... if the 'seminar' hadn't been with the hat-check girl in one of the night clubs.He was only a little drunk when he came in... at five a.m. He looked alarmed when he saw me. I guess it was because of my screams. I was lying there on the floor, you see -- No, don't say anything. I'm not finished yet. Of course, the baby was dead. It was a boy. But they worked over me at the hospital and fixed me up fine. They even took my appendix out, too. They threw that in free. It was all fine.And, of course, one more thing no more children. Do you know what that means? You're not a woman. You're not anything. You're a gutted shell... Sure, I went out with some of the men after that. A few months of it. I'd been made dirty and I wanted to be clean. You can see that, can't you?... Anyway, I got my revenge on Dana. I kept on living with him.You hunt so hungrily for love... love, if you can find it, you think, might give things meaning again.All right. I'm listening.I know. Until I met you I didn't think it was possible, either.You just love to shock people, don't you?! Where on earth did you learn to dance like that?What did she say?Home... A beach, a car, a park...It can't go on like this much longer, Milt.(bucking up courage;You've got to become an officer.You're eligible for the extension course that came in with the draft. When you get your commission they'd ship you back to the States -- new officers aren't kept at posts where they've been enlisted men. Then --Then I could divorce Dana and follow you and marry you.That's a fine, intelligent point of view. Suppose I said I've always hated Sergeants. That would make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?You can't be certain of that --Why don't you tell the truth?You just don't want the responsibility. You're probably not even in love with me --I don't know what's happened to you -- you were honest at first --And so they were married and lived unhappily ever after.Neither have I.Neither would I.You'll make a fine officer. A remarkable officer.I'm afraid I'm not going to tell you.I'm not going to hide anything. I'm just not going to tell you.I don't think it's any of your business who he is.Not very nice. But then there's the compensation of knowing you'll have to live with me the rest of your life.I gander why men feel so differently about it than women.Done all what?I don't know. Why?I always thought you did it because you wanted to get ahead.It's a lovely day out. I think I'll go for a walk.I wonder which is hurt more -- your pride or your curiosity?When I'm ready to ask you for a divorce we can discuss it again.And do eat your breakfast, Dana. It's getting cold.... I guess I felt it that night I asked you to become an officer. When you didn't say yes right away.I guess I knew deep down you wouldn't do it. But -- It seemed such a simple plan for us...I guess that's the trouble with Dana... He's always tried to be something he isn't. Poor Dana... I don't think he ever needed me until now. Well, here we are saying goodbye. And talking about two other people.I'm going back with him, Milt. There's something in being needed. It isn't love. But it's something.That sounds like Milt Warden, all right.No, Milt. I don't want to kiss you any more. I just want to remember you. And you to remember me.I think It's the most beautiful place I ever saw in my lire.There's a legend. If they float in toward shore, you'll come back some day. If they float out to sea, you won't.Oh, I am sorry.(tossing the last of leisWho?", "clean_line": "good morning sergeant looking husband oh course left things purchased know telling bit lately husband says efficient makes efficient sergeant love good bye sergeant matter yes general spend time buttering generals time company maybe promotion went morning looking way look gather business wasn successful dana credit brains right makes right suppose know hate talk way knowing dana want bed bedroom oh isn sergeant warden better step inside ll wet looking husband isn isn good haven slightest idea town guess town way wasn club having drink ll try phoning club want sergeant taking awful chance know maid liable home time think sergeant goes sink picks upthat like sergeant confidence dislike honesty acquire old fashioned virtue clever virile waste subject tell waste positive negative negative interesting evil example house child tell thoughts sergeant help know sergeant honest know maybe spend money sergeant maybe hello think coming guess came little early overanxious weren overanxious got right dot certainly chose savory spot meeting ve chances picked minutes care went alley loving probably think tramp try gallant sergeant think mistake come right hand ve got bathing suit dress hope ocean ice cold hope freeze solid chunk love way laugh kissed way figuring men think ve adding machine adding machine guess won matter hinting know maybe lot maybe think lot crazy forget man rotten filthy mind rest minute convince different yes true small sewage ve listening day ll story getting sound like typical male sweat like typical male right ve told think time ll tell bloody messy thing barracks married captain dana holmes years lieutenant fort bliss lived right little lake fish swim dream cottage sure able picture road miles highway miles neighbor telephone hadn married long knew husband stepping mother tells life happens lot women course tell happens time pregnant ve hope think happy night pains began weeks early month early remember dana putting dapper silk gabardine uniform wear going officer seminar kidding false labor think humorous told home early bring doctor smiled tenderly told psychic reactions women pregnancy fear early maybe seminar hadn hat check girl night clubs little drunk came looked alarmed saw guess screams lying floor finished course baby dead boy worked hospital fixed fine took appendix threw free fine course thing children know means woman gutted shell sure went men months dirty wanted clean got revenge dana kept living hunt hungrily love love think things meaning right listening know met think possible love shock people earth learn dance like home beach car park like longer milt bucking courage ve got officer eligible extension course came draft commission ship states new officers aren kept posts ve enlisted men divorce dana follow marry fine intelligent point view suppose said ve hated sergeants lot sense wouldn certain tell truth want responsibility probably love know happened honest married lived unhappily ll fine officer remarkable officer afraid going tell going hide going tell think business nice compensation knowing ll live rest life gander men feel differently women know thought wanted ahead lovely day think ll walk wonder hurt pride curiosity ready ask divorce discuss eat breakfast dana getting cold guess felt night asked officer yes right away guess knew deep wouldn simple plan guess trouble dana tried isn poor dana think needed saying goodbye talking people going milt needed isn love sounds like milt warden right milt want kiss want remember remember think beautiful place saw lire legend float shore ll come day float sea won oh sorry tossing leiswho"}, "GALOVITCH": {"raw_line": "You no talk now, Prewitt.
