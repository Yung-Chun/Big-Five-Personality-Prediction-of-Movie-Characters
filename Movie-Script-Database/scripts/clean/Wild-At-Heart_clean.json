What little I\u0092m sure he has.Yes.Yes.See! I knew you had it all under control.Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can\u0092t ever stop talkin\u0092 \u0092bout that town.Santos... No...

You know too much \u0092bout little Lula\u0092s mom...Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you\u0092re gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you\u0092re shit... D\u0092you think I\u0092d let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.Oh, don\u0092t worry \u0092bout that...This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindu\u0092s lifetime to unfix... You better get a move on, Johnnie, before that boy got her holdin\u0092 down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin\u0092 dope up her arms.I\u0092m stayin\u0092 right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I\u0092m comin\u0092 to get her.

I thought you was never gonna come back to your room.Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.No, but my guess is they\u0092re headed west, so prob\u0092ly Texas. Their money must be runnin\u0092 low. I don\u0092t think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.Could she be doin\u0092 okay, Johnnie? She\u0092s tryin\u0092 to prove somethin\u0092 to me, that\u0092s all. Lula ain\u0092t doin\u0092 no more\u0092n showin\u0092 off, defyin\u0092 me...

Can I talk to Lula?What?...Peanut...Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?Stab it and steer.I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God\u0092s own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin\u0092?I guess I started smokin\u0092 when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.It\u0092s okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn\u0092t have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin\u0092 that at my parole hearin\u0092. He was a good ol\u0092 boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can\u0092t ask for more than that.You\u0092re perfect for me, too.In a fire, as I recall.You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.How\u0092d it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?I can\u0092t hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.Didn\u0092t he say somethin\u0092?So how\u0092d he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?\u0091We\u0092 did it? Whattaya mean? Didn\u0092t he force you?And you never told nobody about it?Here she goes again...That ain\u0092t never will happen, honey. Least not in our lifetime.You okay, honey?Just sounded like an old gal havin\u0092 a good time to me... You ready to dance?Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl? Or are you gonna save youself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it\u0092s a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.Come here.I\u0092m sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.That\u0092s good... Now go get yourself a beer. You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y\u0092all know this one?...\u0092Cause I\u0092m only gonna sing that song to my wife.That so? You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?We didn\u0092t have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don\u0092t need to make more\u0092n it was. This couple\u0092s goin\u0092 on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.Hell, why should the Datin\u0092 Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin\u0092 to eat.Yeah?You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain\u0092t we been doin\u0092 a pretty fair job this far?At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin\u0092 out? And what you\u0092ll do and what you\u0092ll think about when you\u0092re on the outside again.It ain\u0092t altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain\u0092t too proud of, but I\u0092ll tell ya from now on I ain\u0092t gonna do nothin\u0092 for no good reason. All I know for sure is there\u0092s more\u0092n a few bad ideas runnin\u0092 around loose out there.Musta been a lesson tellin\u0092 ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?You tell the boy who knocked you up?What happened to him?What\u0092s that, peanut?Actin\u0092 funny how?Hell, peanut...Prob\u0092ly the rain boys from Outer Space.Sound like ol\u0092 Dell\u0092s more\u0092n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn\u0092t visit that ol\u0092 Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.What\u0092s that?So?There\u0092s worse things that can happen to a man, honey.Let\u0092s go dancin\u0092, peanut. I\u0092m ready.One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You\u0092re twenty years old - aren\u0092t you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin\u0092 us apart? Puttin\u0092 a detective on us. I\u0092ll tell ya Lula... Well... It\u0092s more\u0092n me killin\u0092 Bob Ray Lemon...Yeah, maybe...No.What are you, sick?... I\u0092m with Lula.Whattya mean?So?You\u0092re gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.It\u0092s a prob\u0092lm I don\u0092t think\u0092s gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I\u0092m thinkin\u0092 of breakin\u0092 parole and takin\u0092 you out to sunny California.You up for that?Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin\u0092 to do.Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin\u0092 my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid\u0092s house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma.Told her my name. Then she said somethin\u0092 like, \u0091It\u0092s so noisy down here. Why don\u0092t we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves?\u0092 She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day.When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind.That\u0092s just what she said. I had a boner with a capital \u0093O.\u0094 I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin\u0092 and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin\u0092 on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin\u0092 bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin\u0092 lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn\u0092t go all the way down your leg?I guess.She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, \u0091I won\u0092t suck you. Don\u0092t ask me to suck you.\u0092Sorta brown, blonde, I guess. But dig this, sweetie. Then she turns over, peels off them orange pants, and spreads her legs real wide and says to me...Say no more... But go easy on me, sweetheart... Tomorrow we got alotta drivin\u0092 to do. Hotter\u0092n Georgia asphalt?What do you mean by necessary? She\u0092s prob\u0092ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.You got about six more big states to go before we find out.That don\u0092t smell like a More.They sure do stink.You ain\u0092t gonna begin worryin\u0092 about what\u0092s bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin\u0092 state lines with a A- Number One certified murderer.Okay, manslaughterer who\u0092s broke his parole and got in mind nothin\u0092 but immoral purposes far\u0092s you\u0092re concerned.You please me, too, peanut.Life is a bitch and then you marry one.What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.We oughta stay somewhere outta the way. Not in no Holidays or Ramadas or Motel Six. If Johnnie Farragut\u0092s on our trail he\u0092ll check those first.Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we\u0092ll try her.Come look at this.There ain\u0092t no water in the swimmin\u0092 pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob\u0092ly from bein\u0092 struck by lightnin\u0092.Let\u0092s get fed, sweetheart. The light\u0092s fadin\u0092 fast.Lula... I learned somethin\u0092 interestin\u0092 today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin\u0092 back into style.Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?Heard on the radio how doctors is usin\u0092 leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used \u0092em?Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin\u0092, they\u0092d sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.How they used to do it. Course they got more sophisticated ways now. Radio said the Chinese, I think it is, figured a better idea is by insertin\u0092 a balloon in the forehead and lettin\u0092 it hand down on the nose.Honest, Lula. I prob\u0092ly ain\u0092t precisely got all the facts straight, but it\u0092s about what they said.We\u0092re about dry bones, sweetheart. We don\u0092t wanna have to push this \u0093bird\u0094 into New Orleans.All I want\u0092s ten bucks regular. Oh yeah, and a Mounds bar.I ain\u0092t got my American Express card with me, so I gotta use cash. Hope that\u0092s okay.I really do think the country done changed just a little while I was away, peanut.You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.Let\u0092s head out into the crazy world of New Orleans... I gotta get somethin\u0092 to eat.Don\u0092t know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin\u0092 in particular?If your neighbors didn\u0092t mind, how\u0092d you get put out of business?What happened on the charges?What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?What\u0092s that, peanut?Ain\u0092t it the way...Huh?My God, it better be, darlin\u0092, cause it\u0092d be the last... What time is it?Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...You got me, peanut.I ain\u0092t never met anyone come close to you, sugar.I do.We didn\u0092t do nothin\u0092 special I can remember. Just talked, is all.Too bad they don\u0092t give an award for talkin\u0092... You\u0092d win first prize. Especially with those tits.No, I like gettin\u0092 up around four a.m. and talkin\u0092 bout wild animals ... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn\u0092t remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn\u0092t remember any of my dreams.It wasn\u0092t no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin\u0092 super-hard and I wasn\u0092t dressed warm. Only instead of freezin\u0092, I was sweatin\u0092 strong.The water was rollin\u0092 off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn\u0092t had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.I know. I kept walkin\u0092, I headed for your house, only it wasn\u0092t your house, really. You let me in only you weren\u0092t real pleased to see me. You kept askin\u0092, \u0091Why\u0092d you come to see me now? Why now?\u0092 Like it\u0092d been a long time since we\u0092d seen each ohter.I know, peanut. But it wasn\u0092t all like you were so unhappy I was there, just you were upset. My bein\u0092 there was upsettin\u0092 to you. You had some kids there, little kids, and I guess you\u0092d got married and your husband was comin\u0092 home any minute.I tell you, Lula. I was shakin\u0092 wet. All this black sweat was pourin\u0092 off me, and I knew I was scarin\u0092 you, so I took off.Well, I ain\u0092t upset about it, darlin\u0092. Just give me an odd feelin\u0092 there a minute, is all.Gotta hex from a voodoo?You do.Where?I\u0092m goin\u0092.Who knows, baby?Lula, darlin\u0092... Makes no difference anyway... We\u0092re outta here.Sweetheart, keep your panties up. We\u0092re in Jimmy Swaggart country.He\u0092s just a regular guy\u0092t needs help, honey. Look at him.My name\u0092s Sailor, and this here\u0092s Lula. What\u0092s yours?What you got in the box?Where you from, Roach?You don\u0092t feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?Just part of life on the road, peanut.Hard to tell what\u0092s shakin\u0092 in a place like this, honey. You don\u0092t want to be walkin\u0092 in the wrong door.Someone up here might know somethin\u0092.Got enough, thanks. We\u0092re lookin\u0092 for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin\u0092 - get somethin\u0092 to eat, too. Anything like that around here?What\u0092s the name of it?You say it\u0092s straight ahead a mile?Thanks.You ready for this?This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it represents a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.Uh huh.Yeah.Honey, we bein\u0092 strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don\u0092t want to make nothin\u0092 of nothin\u0092.I tend to like \u0092em with a little more meat on the bones. Face ain\u0092t bad, though.What\u0092s wrong, sweetheart? Somethin\u0092 botherin\u0092 you?More\u0092n likely.I ain\u0092t so sure it\u0092s a great idea, but that\u0092s up to you. Just don\u0092t tell her where we are.I was just wastin\u0092 time, peanut, till you come back.Honey, I\u0092m sorry. It wasn\u0092t nothin\u0092. Come on and get up and we\u0092ll take off.Told you not to call your mama.Under a hundred.Not in Houston. We\u0092d be better off in some place more out of the way.That\u0092d be good, Lula.What\u0092s that, peanut?This ain\u0092t news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.POWERMAD!!!You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin\u0092 before I met you.Not exactly, sugar... One reason we\u0092re in all the trouble we\u0092re in right now is cause of what I was doin\u0092... I tried to tell you this before...Well, there\u0092s a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol\u0092 guy...Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin\u0092 for a man named Marcello Santos...I quit workin\u0092 for \u0092im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don\u0092t know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin\u0092 out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin\u0092... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin\u0092... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don\u0092t think I been lyin\u0092 to you \u0092bout other things, sugar.Lula, you there?You upset with me?I didn\u0092t want to say it ... but I had a feelin\u0092 Santos was up to somethin\u0092 with your mama...They have, sugar.It\u0092s a comfortin\u0092 idea.There\u0092s worse places, honey.Trust me on it.We\u0092ll be al\u0092right, peanut, long as we\u0092ve got room to move.I don\u0092t know...

I really need to know.I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.You heard right.Life is unpredictable.I didn\u0092t see nothin\u0092...Is there a contract?...

"Mama???Like hell.Why?... He\u0092s right in the groove.Seein\u0092s how you\u0092re about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don\u0092t know how you can criticize.Meetin\u0092 him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama\u0092s hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.Can\u0092t all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob\u0092ly wouldn\u0092ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn\u0092t kicked his ass out.Real soon ... I\u0092ll be makin\u0092 the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.Hey baby...\u0092Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad\u0092s at \u0093The Hurricane.\u0094Did you ever think somethin\u0092 like about the wicked witch of the east comin\u0092 flyin\u0092 in?... Did you ever think somethin\u0092 and then later think you\u0092ve said it out loud to someone?Well, I was thinkin\u0092 about smokin\u0092 actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole \u0092em from her beginnin\u0092 in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I\u0092ve just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They\u0092re longer.What brand\u0092d she smoke?Gee, Sailor. I\u0092m sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.I\u0092d stand by you, Sailor ... through anything.You move me, Sailor, you really do. You mark me the deepest.You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?Started he couldn\u0092t remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin\u0092 me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin\u0092 the old paint off our house without usin\u0092 a mask... But I don\u0092t know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.Finally in the middle of the one night, with me and mama asleep upstairs ... he poured kerosene over himself and lit a match.Near burned down the house. We got out just in time.It was a year before I met you.Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?Sailor, you are somethin\u0092 else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I\u0092d be startin\u0092 to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.That\u0092s true. Uncle Pooch wasn\u0092t really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy\u0092s? And my mama never knew nothin\u0092 about me and him - that\u0092s for damn sure. His real name was somethin\u0092 kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more\u0092n a little.You\u0092re terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don\u0092t think I care for it.Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin\u0092 her hair dyed? And I was alone in the house.Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin\u0092 a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin\u0092 that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.Not really. Least not so I recall now.No, he picked me up.He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid\u0092s dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there\u0092s all different kinds of rapes. I didn\u0092t exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn\u0092t seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin\u0092 my sandwich.Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin\u0092 in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin\u0092 us separated from outer space...Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin\u0092. Seems to me the government could do somethin\u0092 about it. One of these mornings the sun\u0092ll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray.That woman\u0092s laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin\u0092 like that... somewhere before... Sound\u0092d like the wicked witch...I\u0092m always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?Sailor, honey...Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.Why didn\u0092t ya sing \u0093Love Me Tender\u0094? ... You told me that was your favorite love song.What you want to watch this trash for? Ain\u0092t one of those people have a real thought in their brain.What you have to get personal about so quick? All I mean is you could possibly read a book.What\u0092s that honey?I\u0092m sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.Don\u0092t the reject guys get anythin\u0092?That don\u0092t seem fair.Sailor?Wouldn\u0092t it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It\u0092d make the future so simple and nice.I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.You know there\u0092s somethin\u0092 I ain\u0092t never told you about, Sailor, and this here\u0092s a story with the lesson that there\u0092s a right time and a wrong time for things to happen... When I was almost sixteen I got pregnant.She got me an abortion......from some old doctor with the hairiest nostrils and ears I ever seen.Afterwards... Momma says......I hope you appreciate my spendin\u0092 six hundred dollars, not countin\u0092 what it cost us to get here and back... This man\u0092s the best damn abortionist in the South.It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.Oh, nothin\u0092. I never let on to mama about Dell bein\u0092 the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn\u0092t tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn\u0092t see the point. Somethin\u0092 terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.Dell disappeared. Dell was learnin\u0092 a hard lesson. What I learned from observin\u0092 Dell is I think people who are frightened want to disappear. He\u0092d startin\u0092 behavin\u0092 weird? Like comin\u0092 up to people every fifteen minutes and askin\u0092 how they were doin\u0092?And just seemin\u0092 real spacey and actin\u0092 funny.Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell\u0092s mama? She found cockroaches in Dell\u0092s underwear.One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin\u0092 one big cockroach on his anus?One time - real late - like about two thirty a.m.? She found Dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin\u0092 sandwiches in the kitchen.Dell told her he was makin\u0092 his lunch and goin\u0092 to work. He\u0092s a welder? And she made him go back to bed.Then he\u0092d carry on about the weather? Talk about how rainfall\u0092s controlled by aliens livin\u0092 on earth. Also how men wearin\u0092 black leather gloves......are followin\u0092 him around.It ain\u0092t so funny now, though. December before Christmas? Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him. He was missin\u0092 for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin\u0092 dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit.The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would \u0093give him peace of mind.\u0094 Nobody\u0092s seen him since.Too bad we all can\u0092t, baby... One thing about Dell?When he was about seventeen, he startin\u0092 losin\u0092 his hair.He\u0092s twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be \u0092bout bald.Yeah, I suppose. But you know somethin\u0092 baby, hair does make a difference.I sure am glad they didn\u0092t give you no prison haircut... Gives me somethin\u0092 to grab hold of while we\u0092re makin\u0092 love?We gotta be careful, honey, my mama\u0092s gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he\u0092s one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...Sailor!I\u0092d got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would....That\u0092s an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.You still got plenty energy for me, baby.Take a picture, bitch... It\u0092ll last longer.I\u0092ll slap those eyes right outta your head.Sorry, baby... When\u0092s the first time you done it with a girl who wasn\u0092t hookin\u0092?What\u0092d you say to her?Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!You mean like pedal pushers?You\u0092re excitin\u0092 me, honey. What\u0092d she do?Poor baby. She don\u0092t know what she missed. What color hair she have?Jesus, honey! You more\u0092n sorta got what you come for... You better rum me back to the hotel, baby... You got me hotter\u0092n Georgia asphalt.I\u0092ll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don\u0092t want her to worry no more\u0092n necessary.I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don\u0092t figure she counted on us takin\u0092 off together like this... I guess this means you\u0092re breakin\u0092 parole, then?What\u0092ll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don\u0092t rain much there.We got through two states already.It ain\u0092t. It\u0092s part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?Yeah, I guess, but - and here\u0092s the lesson part - they ain\u0092t supposed to be so bad for you.Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don\u0092t exaggerate.Thank the Lord. Well, you ain\u0092t let me down yet, Sailor. That\u0092s more\u0092n I can say for the rest of the world?What kinda trash talk is that?That\u0092s disgustin\u0092. Those kinda sentiments shouldn\u0092t be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?Got anyplace special in mind?How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don\u0092t hardly never get washed, and I don\u0092t like the idea of lyin\u0092 on other people\u0092s dirt.What\u0092s that, honey?It\u0092s huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin\u0092 up from the big N.O.Say what? Honestly, sugar, you can talk more shit sometimes?Yeah, it\u0092s a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw \u0092em by the register and the girl throw \u0092em in. I\u0092m not big on resistin\u0092. So what about a leech?I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.Sailor? You expect me to believe a man\u0092d be goin\u0092 around with a arm sewed to his nose?Sailor Ripley! You stop! You\u0092re makin\u0092 this shit up and I ain\u0092t gonna sit for it!Honey, we\u0092re goin\u0092 to bed now and it\u0092s time to change the subject.We sure don\u0092t, honey... Get me a Mounds?That took long enough. You forget my Mounds?You got to keep an eye on it. That\u0092s sure.I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of \u0092em. Oh, Sailor you\u0092re so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it\u0092s like it\u0092s talkin\u0092 to me when you\u0092re inside? Like it\u0092s got a voice all it\u0092s own. You get right on me.Why were you killin\u0092 pigeons, Mr. Kovich? Were you in the extermination business?What\u0092s wrong with pigeons, Mr. Kovich?It\u0092s just another case, Sailor.One person thinks he\u0092s doin\u0092 somethin\u0092 good and ever\u0092body else gets upset about it.Sailor?... Sailor, honey?Ever imagine what it\u0092d be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast?... Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?Shhhhh... It\u0092s four o\u0092clock... That woman\u0092s laugh the other day had somethin\u0092 to do with this feelin\u0092? ... Like bein\u0092 ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.Anythin\u0092 interestin\u0092 in the world come out of somebody\u0092s weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we\u0092re seein\u0092 these days?You certain?Recall the time we was sittin\u0092 one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin\u0092 against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, \u0091You feel it beatin\u0092 in there, Lula?... Get used to it, cause it belongs to you now.\u0092 D\u0092you recall that?I was hopin\u0092 you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it\u0092s the best night of my life.I really do think it\u0092s the best night of my life.Talkin\u0092s good. Long as you got the other? I\u0092m a big believer in talkin\u0092, case you ain\u0092t noticed.You think so, baby? Does my talkin\u0092 bother you, honey?What was this one?Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.Oh, baby, what an idea. I\u0092d always be happy to see you, no matter what.Sometimes dreams just don\u0092t mean nothin\u0092... Stuff comes into your mind and you don\u0092t have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain\u0092t no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.Take a bite of Lula.Let\u0092s get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin\u0092 about this place. Feelin\u0092 all that voodoo...Who do?Oh my God... It\u0092s Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin\u0092!Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.You think he saw us?He was sittin\u0092 there havin\u0092 a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.You always make that strange little funny laugh when you talk?This guy\u0092s crazy.Why you goin\u0092 to Alaska? And where\u0092d you get them puppies? They look sick.Sailor! Stop! Stop the car now!I\u0092m sorry, but I can\u0092t take this. Roach, or whatever your name is, you come out of there with them dogs this instant!I\u0092m truly sorry? I\u0092m truly sorry, Roach. But ain\u0092t gonna make it to Alaska? Least not any part of the way with us. You\u0092d best find a party to take care of those dogs proper, before they all die? And, if you don\u0092t mind my sayin\u0092 so? You could most certainly use some serious lookin\u0092 after yourself, startin\u0092 with a bath!Drive.I know you\u0092re thinkin\u0092 that I got more\u0092n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn\u0092t help it. Sailor, I really couldn\u0092t. I\u0092m sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin\u0092 hunk of awful-smellin\u0092 meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!Do me a favor, Sailor? Don\u0092t pick up no more hitchers, okay?I wouldn\u0092t mind a little night life. How about you?Maybe there\u0092s a place we could hear some music. I feel like dancin\u0092. We could ask someone.How about speed metal?Any kinda rock\u0092n\u0092roll, honey.We\u0092ll find out in a hurry.Come on.You got yourself a deal.I\u0092ll be damned if I\u0092m leavin\u0092. That band is too good?You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin\u0092 by herself?Well, she ain\u0092t talked to nobody and ain\u0092t nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?You think she\u0092s pretty?Mama. I been thinkin\u0092 about her. She\u0092s prob\u0092ly worried to death by now.I want to call her and tell her I\u0092m okay. That we\u0092re okay.Pardon me? Y\u0092all got a phone here I can use?Back in a bit.I\u0092m fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.Need me for what, mama? I\u0092m perfectly fine, and safe, too.Just a place.Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?No, mama, I\u0092m in Mexico, and we\u0092re about to get on an airplane to Argentina!Mama, I\u0092m hangin\u0092 up this phone now.I ain\u0092t that dumb, mama. Sailor and I been on a crime spree? Knockin\u0092 off convenience stores all across the south? Ain\u0092t you read about it?I am all right, mama. That\u0092s why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.Don\u0092t be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.It\u0092s me who\u0092s wastin\u0092 time, Sailor, bein\u0092 with you.Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin\u0092 your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I\u0092m gonna feel?How much we got left, honey?You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.Jesus! How could anyone listen to this crap?I\u0092ll bet.Damn!HOLY SHIT!! IT\u0092S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN\u0092 FUCKIN\u0092 DEAD!!!!I can\u0092t take no more of this radio... I ain\u0092t never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin\u0092 music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!The world\u0092s gettin\u0092 worse, I think, Sailor. And it don\u0092t sound like there\u0092s much we can do about it, neither.Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin\u0092, Alamo Alamo. They ain\u0092t forgettin\u0092 about it in a hurry. That\u0092s the thing \u0092bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What\u0092s troublin\u0092 you, sugar?I just figured you was out bein\u0092 Mr. Cool...You\u0092re scarin\u0092 me, baby.You knew my daddy?Oh shit...God, Sailor... That\u0092s the night my daddy died.That\u0092s some big secret you been carryin\u0092, Sailor.How\u0092d you know my daddy?Yeah, I\u0092m here.No, Sailor darlin\u0092. Just shockin\u0092 sometimes when things aren\u0092t the way you thought they were... I been carryin\u0092 a secret too...That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin\u0092... I saw mama up in her room with Santos......They was laughin\u0092 arm in arm like animals.My mama... So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.Well, we\u0092re really out in the middle of it now, ain\u0092t we?If you say so.I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain\u0092t never trusted nobody before.What\u0092s that?Oh God, Sailor.SAILOR!!!Sailor, what are we gonna do?You think she\u0092s gonna make it?I can\u0092t take this, Sailor. She\u0092s dyin\u0092 right in front of our eyes...She died right in front of me. Why\u0092d she have to go and do that, Sailor?Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain\u0092t even noon yet.No radio or TV...And no AC.Now what?Sailor?This ain\u0092t exactly my most thrillin\u0092 notion of startin\u0092 a new life.I\u0092m gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don\u0092t feel so good? This heat makes me tired.That you, Sail, honey?You find any work?I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.A little, I think... Darlin\u0092?Come sit by me.I don\u0092t know that this is the right place for us.I know, Sailor. Nothin\u0092 is.How?You from Texas, Mr. Peru?What\u0092s Cao Ben?Twenty.Somethin\u0092 in that man scares me.Darlin\u0092, I still ain\u0092t feelin\u0092 so well. I\u0092m goin\u0092 to bed.No, I don\u0092t think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.Sailor? You know what?Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can\u0092t say it.Well, nothin\u0092 personal, but I ain\u0092t sure it\u0092s okay by me.Really, Sailor, it ain\u0092t nothin\u0092 against you. I love you.I know. Just I\u0092m sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin\u0092, and this don\u0092t help soothe me.No, he\u0092s out changin\u0092 the oil in the car.Well... Yeah - okay.You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain\u0092t any of your business, that\u0092s for sure.Get out.GET OUT!!!No way... GET OUT!!!Fuck me.Sailor...You been drinkin\u0092, huh?Can\u0092t tell yet. Where\u0092d you go?Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.Yeah... He was lookin\u0092 for you.Some... Sparky said Red\u0092s promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.So where\u0092d you say you was?Sail?Let\u0092s leave here.I mean tomorrow.Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna.Who says I\u0092m smart? You up to somethin\u0092 with Bobby Peru, Sailor?He\u0092s a stone fuckin\u0092 criminal, honey, and you ain\u0092t.That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.He\u0092s the kind liked it.Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped \u0092em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob\u0092ly killed the most.I sure enjoy smokin\u0092, Sailor. I hate that it\u0092s bad for you.That man\u0092s a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you\u0092ll regret it. If you live to.This whole worlds wild at heart and weird on top.I wish you really, truly loved me... I wish you\u0092d sing me \u0093Love Me Tender\u0094 ... I wish I was somewhere over that rainbow... Shit. Shit, shit, shit.Mama, Sailor\u0092s in deep trouble here. I just can\u0092t leave him.I\u0092m goin\u0092, mama. No way I can\u0092t go.Course I am, mama.Six.Figure we\u0092ll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown\u0092s Pig Pickin\u0092.Sailor ain\u0092t a boy no more, mama.Really, mama, I gotta go.Wouldn\u0092t make any difference.Mama ... if you get in the way of me and Sailor\u0092s happiness, I\u0092ll fuckin\u0092 pull your arms out by the roots.Don\u0092t give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This ain\u0092t the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo.Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.Nothin\u0092, honey. Mama\u0092s just actin\u0092 strange.Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain\u0092t you got one cute mouth tonight?Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.Course he ain\u0092t never killed nobody. Why\u0092d you say that, Pace?And?Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn\u0092t hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain\u0092t always been so lucky... We\u0092re almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.Thinkin\u0092 a second, baby.Why, honey?Pace, your daddy\u0092d love you even if you didn\u0092t have no hair at all.Still partial to Camels, huh?Shake hands with your daddy.You hungry? Pace and I ain\u0092t had dinner yet.I\u0092m sorry, Sailor. I just can\u0092t help it. Give me a minute and I\u0092ll quit.Really, Sail, I\u0092ll be okay.What\u0092re you talkin\u0092 about?
