{"Date-Night": {"PHIL": {"raw_line": "Hey, hey! Careful Clara! You were the one who told me not to mess up the precious picture piles! he gives him a long, slow kiss.It was nice.Look at this one of your Mom with me. I mean that woman can't contain her 'Love!Man, I wish I was them. Phil kisses the back of Clara's neck, but her smile fades as she stares at the picture. He notices.We're having kids? With an \"S\"?You'll be even hotter long toothed. Right now to be honest Clara they're a little stumpy.wasn't the pictures.We'll fix the picture piles, Clara. We've got all the time in the world. From now on everything's gonna be just about us. Suddenly, a YOUNG VOICE breaks through the darkness.Yep?Really?OK, so I say today we go for the slacker look - cool yet approachable.Oh. Well... that's cool too!What?Uh... yeah. Sure. Phil grabs the Captain Crunch cereal box out cupboard and starts toward the table when Clara, dressed in a suit, comes into the room and spots it.Yeah, sure! You know it's only one bowlOne bowl a day a week. Clara, eyebrows raised, eyes the Captain Crunch already in Phil's hand. Phil shakes the carton at Ollie.This is not for you today!Oh. Whoops.Sorry I dropped the ball. It's this Quarterly Report to Mr. Rivers today. You know how he freaks me out with all of his mixed animal metaphors that I don'tDid you hear me?Sorry for the milky mouth. He heads out. With a sigh, Clara spots Phil's left his 1\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd1 dirty glass on the counter. She cleans it in the sink, then gets the carton out of the fridge to put some milk in her own coffee. A DRIBBLE comes out. Shaking her head, she tosses the carton in the trash.Yes we are! ike you say to me every morning. Reaching the carport, Phil scoots between his car and Clara's. He tries to open his driver's door, but Clara' car is parked TOO CLOSE and the door only opens a few inches. He tries to SQ'L'-Z- IN, but ends up GETTING STUCK halfway.I'm sorry I'm late. The construction on the highways is insane these days!Uh. OK. You mean... take the fund in a more high risk direction?Oh.Kinda.Sorry. Still not totally getting you.Listen, Mr. Rivers. I don't need to... I was ripping big bloody hunks of meat and eating them like tartare when George was still... in the jungle!I can't be demoted, Mr. Rivers. I just can't.Unbelievable!Hey buddy. Finally moving out? I gotta tell you it's about time.On a school night? Why?Tonight? What? No.Clara? Cl- He stops in the doorway as he spots her. Made up in an evening dress in front of a full length mirror, Clara looks STUNNING as she finishes putting an earring on.Wow. Wow. Clara tns and smiles.Wow... It sounds... great.It's just... is there any chance we coul take a rain check?Yeah. Unfortunately I really need to do a bit of work tonight. EListen, I'm sorry...Listen, if I had more warning-Listen... any other night.That dress really wasn't playing fair, Clara. With a smile, Clara watches Phil tie his tie.Well get a move on, girl! She zips her dress back up.Ruth.OK... not so sure about that.Clara? What do you think?fine. Fine. oust as they climb into the car, Clara stops.I'll just wait in the car as you go back E inside to pee. Again.You gotta almost feel sorry for Mayor Diggs. Tries to widen all the highways to get reelected, but all everyone's going to remember when it's time to vote is all this mess.Yeah. That's why I turned on the air.Antagonizing? How does a five year old \"antagonize?\" I'm sure she wouldn't have mentioned it if it wasn't \"the Mayor's daughter.\"(trying to make a joke of Got all my best traits, huh? He looks over to see that Clara looks out of the wiF n,, not responding - a response in itself. He sucks in.I think he's fine.Maybe she's right if the school has that kind of attitude. Clara's about to object bit stops herself and takes a breath, playing affection-.-ely with the back of Phil's hair.Right now? Traffic.Yeah?What's AMA?That's unbelievable!Huh.I thought you were cold.But I turned it down because... you see when you open and close your vents it makes my... never mind. Phil reaches over and turns up the air again. Tapping his fingers on the wheel with a sigh, he gets fed up, suddenly veering the car to the shoulder and speeding toward the exit.I'm just gonna take a shortcut.Clara, please just trust me, OK They zoom ahead for a moment in silence. Frustrated, Clara shuts her vents, once again sending a POWERFUL GUST OF COLD AIR onto Phil's face. Biting his tongue, he just leaves it blowing on him as they drive.I promise you it wouldn't have been any faster. I promise! OK, Phil. Will you just tell them we're here? I'm gonna go pee.Now?Nothing. As Clara hurries off, Phil, shaking his head, makes his way through the crowds to the SUPERMODEL HOSTESS.Thanks. The name is Foster.You gave away our table? We're just ten minutes late!You have an eight minute grace period? How did you come up with an eight minute grace period?So what if someone's 9 minutes late?OK. Which adds up to ten minutes! We're 11 minutes late. That's just one minute later than the grace on the grace.So how long's the wait for another table?Oh boy.Two hours. They gave away our reservation. Peanut?They wouldn't care, Clara. If they call your name at the bar and you don't answer, they give your table away. So how about a nut? A YOUNG HOST mills around the bar.Oh, I see. Lying and graft were the answer! Clara shakes her head, then notices the YOUNG HOST searching for the party and starts focusing on him instead of Phil as she thinks.I'm sure if you had been there instead of peeing again you would have done it better.You're not even listening to me, are you?Wait. What are you doing?We can't do this, Clara.Not the truffles.We're not the Gales.Well, what if they show up now?I'm serious!What?You know what? You're absolutely right. Clara lowers her menu and they look at each other for what feels like the first time tonight.I'm sorry, Mrs. Gale.You're not looking too shabby yours Mrs. Gale.Whoa. Wait a minute. Where are we going?Listen, this is all getting out of hand, OK? I admit we maybe did something a teeny bit wrong, but- Suddenly, they grab Phil and Clara, putting HANDKERCHIEFS over their noses and mouths. Phil and Clara veil and struggle for a moment, then PASS OUT.Whoa. What the hell is this? Tied in the chair next to him, Clara jumps as the Older Burly Man waves the stick under her nose.I don't know. A VOICE speaks from a speakerphone on the tableListen... you can just have all our money, OK? Whatever's there, it's yours. We're not looking to cause problems or put up any kind fight. We'll just walk away and not report anything, OK? All we want is for you to let us go unharmed.You must be kidding! Like a million people don't do it every single night of the week! This is unbelievable! I'm just in shock here! Harry and Frank look at each other, puzzled.\"Into the Rainbow?\" What the hell's that? Restaurant code?Photos? Clara figures out what's happened.They know we're not the Gales. Don't you get it!OK, listen, what happened is we lost our reservation and when the host came around yelling the Gales' name and no one answered, my wife said that we were them. I swear on my life to you that's what happened.I know that seems really weird. Listen, I agree, that's what I said to her.That was just... we were... no, you don't understand...Wait a minute. What's going on?Please! You can't do this! We're not lying!Oh Jesus. Don't do it!Jesus!Whoa.I'm... not feeling so great...I just can't... go any further. Harry and Frank look at each other, not sure what to do.oa! Clara! No Harry drops them, raising his hands. Phil gets up and grabs the gun and keys, then awkwardly hits Harry as hard as he can on the back of the neck with the butt of the gun. Harry looks at him, confused.Sorry. i was trying to knock you out.ought that's what you do when-OK, let me just start from the very beginning...We got to the restaurant late because we hit all this traffic on the highway-What?Because you always interrupt me when I try to tell stories, and every time you do it disrupts my flow.Fine.I thought you said you weren't going to interrupt me, Clara.Do you think he really cares, Clara? were just kidnapped, CHLOROFORMED and almost shot! I don't think he's going turn around and book us for reservation theft! Am I right?So all of a sudden Clara yells out that we're these other people.Yeah. I know! Even the guy on the speakerphone couldn't believe it!We didn't \"bond\" over it. I'm just saying, speakerphone guy obviously thought it was weird to do.Oh c'mon! And we found out speakerphone guy's name, Phil. It's Mr. Stockton. The Young Policeman looks up, interested.Wait. So you already know about this guy? You know who he is? A knock at the door and a handsome man in his late 40's, LIEUTENANT MANNING, enters the room with a smile. He reaches over and shakes their hands.That sounds more likeYou tell it, Clara.Seriously, Clara. You tell him.Who is this Stockton guy anyway?Clara?Well, I can pick things up then. Phil notices Clara giving him a LOOK.What? Why are you looking at me like that?OK, well, I had the same question for her when we sat down, which she thought wasOW! Jesus! Clara stink-eyes Phil AGAIN, trying to get the message across.And there's that look again!OK, I'm not dense, Clara. That was not an accident and if those weren't looks-What are you talking about?The police guy? Clara, that's totaWhat do you mean?be I said it to the otherOh God.Well then we're screwed! Who do we go to? The FBI? The CIA?You've got it, Clara. Spin it back now!It's all right. You just should have spun it when I told you to. Flustered, she pulls back out and tries again.rn! Quick!Run! Phil and Clara get out of the car and run away on The Large Man marches over and inspects his bumpe yells after them.Oh God! Ruth! Is everything OK?What's wrong?Ruth, I need you to listen. We'veYou think this is my fault, don't you? T - ftYou know, your Mom shows me no respect, 0 Clara. And you just pretend like it isn't happening.What? Clara starts looking through her purse for her phone.Holbrooke Peterson? You mean the tongue guy?Holbrooke was your prom date who you said had the really long tongue, right?Since when have you been in touch with Holbrooke Peterson?Facebook? I didn't know you were on Facebook!0 yeah? Who else are you \"in touch\" h on Facebook?Um... yeah... I don't go by... it's 1 - usL Phil. Nice to meet you, too.Oh. The environmental thing.Whoa. You carry that around at home?Uh... there's already writing all over this.That's... charming. Phil scoots the paper back to Holbrooke, who squints and dramatically turns it sideways.No. Yeah. I get it. Holbrook. makes a big show of putting his gun back holster as he gets up.I don't know. Maybe I should have had one of Holbrooke's eeegerag warn raaaarrrrghereeeeetas.smells like french fries back here,What the hell's going oWell, tell them to stand down.Tell your men to stand down, Holbrooke.What?All right! Nobody move or he gets it! Clara's STUNNED. The Agents look at each other, but don't seem overly concerned.I'm not screwing around!Keycard.Thanks. He and I, the communication isn't great... Getting the keychain from Holbrooke, Phil uses the keycard then lets it fall to the floor as the door unlocks and they back outside.Just give me your car keys, Holbrooke. When we're about to drive off we'll let you go.What? HOLB'?n`_ The key chain you dre-,~_d with the keycard inside. The keys were on that. And so the hero falls...Shit.YOW! Man is that loud! As the Agents run toward the door, Clara quickly grabs the gun from Phil and shoots, nailing the lock.How are you so good at that? The Agents try the door, but are LOCKED IN. Agent #1 tells his men to stand back and tries shooting the glass, but it's BULLETPROOF. He gestures and all the Agents rush around to the front.Where? They both look around, unsure.Aren't you supposed to be our hostage?It wasn't so much of a drop. it was more of a... bobble.Let me have the gun. As Clara gives it to him, Phil quickly runs back and hands it to HolbrookeHere. Tell them you got it back from us. Holbrooke takes back his aun, grateful.it's just on the other side of that bridge. I think we're going to make it. He notices Clara looking at him.Bourne identity?Where I held your hand for the first time.It's because we could sleep 'til noon.I just don't understand when we got so... I don't know...No, I was thinking numb. When did we become one of those couples that we used to look at in restaurants back then and think were so sad?It's not that I don't want another kid, Clara. It's just... I used to be the whole pie with you. And now with Ollie and your work, I'm barely even a piece of the pie anymore. I'm, like, maybe a pecan on a piece of the pie! So part of me's not jumping at the chance of having the little pecan I have left of your attention going into some new baby's mouth!I think we're OK. Just play cool and keep walking. The patrol car continues across and down the street. 1\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd1 Phil and Clara breathe a sigh of relief. Then suddenly, a few blocks down, BRAKE LIGHTS. The patrol car turns around and TURNS ON ITS LIGHTS, zooming back toward them.Now you can say shit. Phil looks around - they're in the middle of the bridge with no place to run. Then he notices the lit up PARTY BOAT coming out the other side of the bridge beneath them.e 's only a few feet.Let go, Clara!go or I'm going to tickle you!Ow! I think I broke my butt.I'm sorry! I didn't do it for pleasure! What is our rule?T ' s your elbow?Well, for jumping off a bridge onto a moving boat, not so bad.Maybe we could just hide or something until this all blows over.iaybe we should just turn ourselvesWait. What if we found the pictures?These pictures that everyone's after. we could get them we'd have some kind o bargaining chip to get out of this.Yeah, but even so, Holbrooke said these clubs are so secret you have to know where they are and how to get in- Clara rummages through her purse and grabs her phone, dialing, then notices Phil looking out, shaking his head.You're not listening to me again!That's great. Clara wanna cracker?ara... Clara turns and looks.You got the info from her though, right?I don't think we have a choice. Not a big shopping hour. They walk past the 24 CHICAGO FITNESS CENTER, lights blazing. Windows show machines filled with young HARDBODIES working out.Now if we wanted to do a little cardio, on the other hand. Who knew that many people worked out at 1 in the morning? Clara thinks a moment, then stops in her tracks and looks back up at the building.You wanna do a little cardio? Clara smirks at him, then Phil, thinking, gets it. He shakes his head.OK, now that's scary. You know you're starting to think like a real criminal? You know that, don't you? Clara waggles her eyebrows. We hear Devo's \"Secret Agent Man\" over a TrC _ GE .Down here?And if you die, does Jane get your commissic-l on the open house? Up ahead, a TWO S:_=:Y LOOKING CHARACTERS huddle near a bunch of GARBAGE CANS watching them, a SMALL FIRE nearby. Nervously, Clara approaches.you! Gale, right?Sorry. From the side... confused you with somebody else. Phil quickly moves on.Uh... well, same thing as you guys, I would guess. Working those \"extra hours,\" right?That never really- OPENS. She shoots Phil a look.OK. Never mind. Phil and Clara inch insiYou know, that's like the 5th gun I've had to my head tonight! Just lower that thing and cool it, OK? Off guard from Phil's reaction, Ray, confused, does.Who are we? Good question! Well, everybody thinks we're \"the Gales\" because we were lucky enough to take your reservation tonight!That's my wife. Flustered, Ray waves Dora to take Clara.Listen, it looks like things didn't turn out the way you planned, but I think all Stockton wants is his pictures back. As soon as he gets them I bet-I'm OK! I'm OK! Ray spots Phil crawling away and gets up, turning to him.No... just... a little ... winded... that... crawling's... tough... on the core...You're Dora's brother?You're late!Clara! Please! Just leave the driving to me, OK?!? I know what I'm- SMASH! - they HIT something head-on, SHATTERING the windshield. Shaking glass off himself, Phil peers forward. They're face to face - nose to nose - with another broken windshield. In the driver's seat of a SOUPED UP HONDA h fiber-optic colored lights, a YOUNG BLACK DUDE \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 stares at them in shock.Shit! The Black Dude gets out of his car to inspect, head in hands.owe you one. Phil throws the car into reverse, but his tires just screech smoke, the wheels spinning in place. Looking out his window toward the front, Phil sees thatShit. Thinking fast, Phil jumps out of his car and hops into the Black Dude's souped up Honda.I'm not yelling! I'm just talking in an very animated voice! Looking back over his shoulder again, Phil sees they're approaching the lar ge intersection with Michigan Avenue.OK, now when I say so, spin your wheel!Ahhhh! Other way! Other way!Yes I did!Why stay on Michigan? Because it's a wider street.She does this wherever we go! Every time! Phil doesn't notice the LIGHTS GROWING BRIGHTER behind him..Clara! Reverse it, keep it straight put your foot to the floor. Give it everything! Clara reverses and Phil puts the car in drive and floors it. The car goes faster... faster...Just trust me! The conjoined cars HIT the steps and their wheels SMOKE as the TWO ENGINES POWER TOGETHER ALL THE WAY UP THE\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Sorry.Can we just try to work together at this?I'm not blaming you. Please? Clara nods.Now whatever direction I give you, take your normal version of it and tone it down like 85 percent, OK?OK. Small left. Now!Yes! No.can do it. Clara.What?I see. I almost got us killed. Forget about the people chasing and shooting at us all night long because of the reservation you stole.Unbelievable! You know, all you complain about is that I don't take risks anymore. Then the second I do, you get mad at me for doing it! I can't win with you!Oh, you have no idea! Every single day from the moment we wake up you're bossy, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 disapproving, inconsiderate-What's the difference? Afraid you're gonna get my cooties?Listen to yourself! You have problems with how I pqt in the toilet paper!Yeah, how about the fact that I have not woken up with our comforter over me once in those 10 nears! You steal the whole thing away from me every night and mummify yourself.Bulls Bull-shit.I see your hock leg lock maneuver. Don't think I don't!Oh yes you do!You're right. I do that. You know why do that, Clara?Because I'm afraid to! God forbid I the wrong kind of grass-fed bio homogenized whatever and meet your wrath! You're like the Nutrition Nazi.How would you even know? You don't give me or anyone else a chance! You're so goddamn controlling! You've got to be Wonder Woman, keeping everyone in line, looking down on them from her fancy Wonder Woman plane and controlling everything with all her wonder superpowers! You paint yourself as this victim but you get off on being the superlady!What? No aspirin in the wonderpurse? How could it be? Clara, furious, HURLS her purse at Phil's head. He ducks and the contents spill all over the road.Yeah, fine! Sure! Screw me ! Even if I survive tonight I'm screwed all around anyway! Screwed with you! Screwed with my job!was supposed to spend all tonight guring out a new brilliant plan for the fund so George wouldn't take it over tomorrow. Doesn't look like that's gonna happen!I don't know, Clara. Maybe because I didn't want you chiming in on how Mr. Rivers was right. He wants the new guy for all the reasons you complain about me! Someone who doesn't \"play it safe.\" Someone who'll \"take a risk.\"I think we said all needs to be said right now, Clara. Panting, Clara holds out the manila envelope.What?What is it? Clara looks over his shoulder, shakes her head and TURNS THE PICTURE THE OTHER WAY AROUND. Phil's eyes go wide.Oh jeez. It's... it's...I bet this didn't have anything to do with Stockton at first.The Mayor must have gone to Stockton's club one night. He saw Dora working there and obviously gave some sign that he was interested.Her sleazy boyfriend Ray finds out and convinces her to take him up on it so they could photograph it and blackmail him.But somehow Stockton found out about the photos too and wanted that power over the mayor himself.But Ray and Dora spotted them and bailed before the Mayor even had a chance to show up. Phil thinks. He snaps his fingers.If we could find some way to get in touch with the mayor directly, without anyone else knowing, there actually might be a way out of this for us. Clara thinks for a moment. A light comes to her eyes.Have a nice night.Jesus!I can't find any rope. Only yarn.Excuse me?OK, why don't you lay off the critiquOh is it a fact?Wrong word choice? Unbelievable! Well, let me throw a little word choice \"correction\" your way.Five year old kids can't be \"antagonistic.\"You must be such a positive influence on our youth.Lucy? Who's Lucy?Hey \"partner.\" How about you put a sock in it now.You don't know me, Mr. Mayor, but I've recently come into possession of something that you were supposed to get from the Gales tonight. Silence on the line.Hello?And whether you realize it or not, we ended up doing you a favor. You see, this man named Mr. Stockton - I know if you know him-Well, he tried to steal the photos from the Gales. He's even got cops on his payroll helping him out. We think he was planning to sabotage your re-election.What do we want? Phil looks at Clara.We just want our lives back. We want to go home, Mr. Mayor.That's it. Mayor Diggs breathes out and rubs his forehead.But now the police think that-Uh... yeah. We'll meet you at the Adler Planetarium in 1 hour. Come alone. EWhen was the last time we watched the sunrise together?Me too.No, I know it's not funny. It's not funny at all.Why are you laughing? They're both cracking up... then Phil notices a moment later that Clara's laughter has turned toYou're not running on fumes, Clara.Nazi.It won't fall apart. And I really can help whenever you feel like it is. With Ollie. Whatever. You just never act like you need me to.You think I see you guys as a distraction? God no, Clara.I'll never be the guy who remembers always put toilet paper on the right way.Listen, you know what I said before, about not being the people we used to be?No, Clara. It's true. We're not. And I know I'm going to drive you crazy again, and you're definitely going to drive me crazy. But I wouldn't want to do it with anybody else. He hugs her tight.We had a good fight tonight, didn't we?What?You think?Here we go.This is what you're looking for. I've tten down our information inside.That's it. We're going home now. The Mayor nods, and Phil and Clara start walking past him toward the parking lot. Mayor Diggs stays behind, nervously tapping the envelope in his hand. As Phil and Clara get halfway to the lot, ALL THE MAYOR'S CAR DOORS OPEN, and Manning, Frank, Harry, and Mr. Stockton climb out. Frank and Harry pop the trunk and grab SHEETS OF CLEAR PLASTIC. Phil's eyes go wide.Oh God. Run, Clara! Phil and Clara start to run, when a GUNSHOT hits the ground in front of them. They turn, when ANOTHER SHOT rings out.Please. Please don't doPlease! We have a child!-eally were planning to give you the pictures, Mr. Mayor. That is, until you -.sre so casual about is not needing to worry about the cop who was after us. That made me a little suspicious because I never told you which cop it was.Which meant Stockton was probably your buddy.But we were still confused, because if you guys are buddies, how do you explain the Falconwood Corporation? Mr. Stockton's face blanches.Runs the hiring of inspectors for the Department of Highways in Chicago. YouMaybe because according to the paperwork you've got there, he owns Falconwood.The more violations Falconwood finds, the longer Eurostruct rents the equipment. That turns into big bucks, Mr. Mayor. I'm sure that's not a moral problem for you, but he's kind of screwing you in an election year, isn't he? Some of us are pretty pissed off about the roads. Mayor Diggs flips through the documents, taking it allDon't think they're going to be calling you the IT guy any-more.Yeah, well-, that's how we roll. They get out of the car and start up the driveway.Yep. We sure are. As he joins Clara on the doorstep, they take each other in.Yeah. Me too. It was fun.So... let's do this again sometime?", "clean_line": "hey hey careful clara told mess precious picture piles gives long slow kiss nice look mom mean woman contain love man wish phil kisses

"CLARA": {"raw_line": "That was nice.Hey from now on when you change the toilet paper, could you just make sure it is out?Oh, believe me, we're just getting started, Phil.That's exactly the one I picked!I just... when I was growing up my Mom and Dad had a picture just like this. Now they can't even acknowledge each other. Phil sympathetically gives her a squeeze.Let's always remember to have some time that's just for the two of us. No matter what else comes up in our lives - if it's work or friends or when we have kids-Yeah, we'll see if you'll be saying that when I'm long in the tooth.Phil. Tell me it wasn't the pictures.You know how long that took?I'm coming, Ollie!Uh Phil?I need to switch. I've got an open house. Phil obviously doesn't want to be bothered right now, but contains it.Yeah. Really. As Clara walks quickly past him, Phil claps his hands together.Ech. Mine. She re-rolls the toothpaste from the bottom up and starts brushing when she sees the sink - a Jackson Pollock of razor hairs and bits of toothpaste. Disgusted, Clara reaches for the Kleenex box, only to discover it's EMPTY. She tosses the box in the trash and shimmies on the towel to get some toilet paper.Ah ah ah... what's that Ollie? You had a bowl yesterday.Did you get his lunch together?Ollie, do you want a banana?Uh huh. He freaks you out with his mixed animal metaphors that you don't understand. Banana Ollie?OK. Have a good day. Phil kisses her on the cheek and Clara absently wipes it off. He looks at her strangely. Noticing, Clara quickly kisses Phil on the cheek.Too much information, Jane.Good for you, Jane. Clara takes out her frustration on the ridge, kicki the side and silencing it.Good for you.Yeah, well, maybe. We don't really have those that much anymore., You know, we're pretty tired all the time between work and Ollie. And some of the shows on TV these days are really great. Ah. I see.I guess. Maybe.Nah. Tonight's no good.So it's OK if we drop him off at 7? Our reservation's at 7:45. She passes another MOTHER desperately searching for a Kleenex for her BOY with snot dripping from his nose.Oh, that's Ollie's teacher. I'll see you later. Clara hangs up her phone and greets Mrs. Cardigan with a warm smile.I've been meaning to tell you that you can just call me Clara, Mrs. Cardigan.Sure, sure. Ollie, go to the car. As Ollie does, Clara turns back to Mrs. Cardigan.Is everything OK?Really? Oh no. Why do you think that's happening?Uh... wow. OK. Mrs. Cardigan starts away. Clara climbs into the car, watching Mrs. Cardigan.Wow. What a bitch.(remembering Ollie's in theI didn't. I really didn't. Clara quickly pulls out.I thought I could take you out to celebrate you finally getting that report in. A romantic dinner downtown like the old days, and teen... Ollie's going to stay at Mom's so we have the house all to ourselves. All night.Great! She turns back and continues getting ready.I thought all the cramming was for this report today. Did something go wrong?Oh. OK. Controlling herself, Clara starts putting her jewelry back in the case.You don't need to apologize, Phil.OK. Maybe another time. Let me just get out of this and call my Mom then. As Clara heads into the closet, Phil looks after her, feeling terrible. About to leave, he notices that around the room, Clara's SET UP CANDLES in anticipation of their romantic night. He looks down again at the papers in his hand and sucks in, conflicted.I'm sorry, Phil. I just felt like she's doing us a favor tonight.You know, I should pee before we go.You're hot?You know, Mrs. Cardigan told me today that Ollie's been antagonizing his daughter.She actually had the gall to suggest we should think about sending him somewhere else.So what are you thinking about?Oh. Well, I heard this unbelievable story from Jane today.She has this old classmate who went into labor with her second child the other day. She's totally healthy and everything's normal with the pregnancy. So she goes into labor and walks into the emergency room, and the second the nurses and attendants see her come in, they go into a panic and start yelling A,LA! ATMiA!Advanced Maternal Age!kid you not!I know. Beat. Clara looks out the window.The funny thing is she's my age, actually. Suddenly, Phil's smile fades as he realizes the possible ulterior motive.I was, but then you turned it down and I got hot.Phil, please don't. You think they're shortcuts but they always take longer. And we're already-What?It's OK. The Nervous Woman quickly leaves the bathroom with the Man. Clara looks after them a second, then washes her hands.How lc= -until they seat us?What?!? Did you tell them that we hit traffic?I mean, did you try something like telling her it was our anniversary, or my birthday, or slipping her some money-Yeah I am. You're sure if I had been there instead of peeing again I would have done it better.Sorry! We're right here!Shhh! The Young Host approaches.The third's running a little going to start without them.See? Was that so hard to do, Phil? bad to be the Gales, eh? Clara opens her menu as looks nervously around the restaurant.Look Phil! It's white truffle season! I'm totally doing it!I'm taking you out.It's just... I don't know. You used to be the one who would think up stuff like this all the time. This hits Phil. He takes in his wife reading the menu for a beat.What's this about?Hey! Jesus! The elevator doors shut and the older Burly Man pushes the G Floor then nods to his partner. They reach in their pockets.Wait a minute. I think there's been a really big mistake here. We're not the Gales.No, Phil. I think they think we're actually \"the Gales\" who made the reservation tonight.But we can't just tell you where they are. We have to take you to them.Phil? He drops to the ground.Phil? What is it?You're not hypoglycemic. Phil shoots Clara a quick LOOK OFWait! In my purse there's a Luna Bar. If you give it to me I can find it for him. With a sigh, Frank hands Clara her purse. She rummages inside... and quickly WHIPS OUT her MINI 409 SPRAY, spritzing Frank right in the eyes. With a shriek, he falls back grabbing his face and dropping his gun. Clara makes a dash and grabs it. As Frank blindly lunges after her, she KNEES HIM IN THE BALLS. He collapses on the ground, whimpering in pain. She spins and points the gun at Harry.Drop the gun and the keys.Phil! Just c'mon!You can tell him.Fine, you tell it. I won't say another word.Which is what they do right before they cancel a reservation anyway.You two kinda bonded over that, didn't you?Oh, don't be like that, Phil. Please.He was in another room on a speakerphone where these guys who kidnapped us took us. But he was obviously the one pulling the strings.Honestly, you wouldn't believe this, but it's because we sat down at the wrong table tonight for dinner.We pretended to be someone else who didn't show up for their reservations. My idea. And it turned out that these people must have something this Mr. Stockton wants.Sorry. I... I lost my train of thought.I'm not looking at you like anything. doesn't pick up on it. Shrugs.Phil, we're in trouHe's in on this. He's got something to do with it.never told him about the GaleHe said, \"How did you know the Gales weren't coming.\" I never told him that was the name of the reservation weHe didn't take the other notes, Phil. Remember? s hil as well.How do we get out of here?We can't just go to another police station, Phil! We don't know how big this is! It might not just be Manning!just let me do it, She spins too late and too severely, hitting the curb.Dammit! I hate this!Would you stop it? You're stressing me out! Angry, Clara whips the car back into the spot, NAILING the car behind them and setting off a loud CAR ALARM WITHOllie. Phil takes out his cellphone and quickly dials, listening as Ruth PICKS UP.What's wrong?What? Just call her again and tell her what's happened! Phil dials the number again. Ruth picks up.Great, Phil. Now she's not picking up at all!So you think it's j1y fault. Listen, Phil. Every single other boyfriend I ever dated got along with her just-What?It's a networking thing for work. Everyone's on Facebook.So do you! He gives her a big, tight hug, lifting her a little.This is my husband, Phil.How beautiful. Or, the candles... Did weIt's so funny. I always knew you'd end up doing something in public service.No thanks, I'm Holbrooke picks up the plate and Margarita glass, then crosses to his INDOOR COMPOSTER, adding the extra liquid and scraps.What does Stockton do?e Rainbow! Stockton asked how we there to set things up!Should we be worried about our sI s staying at my mAnd she of you. As it comes out of her mouth, Clara realizes and guiltily looks over at Phil BRISTLING. Holbrooke goes to a pile of already used sheets of paper and picks one up along with a pen.Thank you so much, Holbrooke. I feel like we're in good hands for the E first time tonight. As Holbrooke goes into the other room to call, Clara lets out a sigh of relief then notices Phil's mood.Phil's really had enough with this guy. Your goodness... where does it end? Clara shoots Phil a look he back, but Holbrooke doesn't get his sarcasm.I. I. guy?crooked cop did it! It's a lie!What? Oh no you're not! Oooohs from the Agents.Wow, Phil! Phil feels a little pumped up with Clara's praise.gotta get going! Quick!Yeah, a bobble's bad...What?Nothing. That was just nice of you, back there.I'm talking about right now. When we used to walk home late at night after going downtown to the clubs. We couldn't ever find a cab, remember? We'd grab those \"healthy\" dogs and cheese fries at the Weiner's Circle and go to the Adler Planetarium to watch the sunrise.I can't believe we used to stay up all night like that.Old.We're not that bad, Phil. I just think we haven't been that honest with each other recently. Phil doesn't understaNot big things. Just little things keep adding up and putting this thing between us.But that's crazy, Phil. When you're home you're the one who seems like your hardly even there! It's all about your work. Believe me, if you- Clara suddenly notices a POLICE CAR, lights off, drive past them over the bridge.Shit!What u high? No way. But looking main at the patrol car speeding toward them, Phil grabs Clara and dashes for the side of the bridge.A GROUP of DRUNKEN PARTIERS on the boat, spotting them, cheer below. Some even take FLASH PICTURES. Phil looks down - if they don't let go soon they're literally going to miss the boat.OW! OW! Dammit, Phil! What's our rule about tickling?Right! And guess what? It wasn't funny for me, Phil! Clara gets up and storms off, clutching her arm. Walking down the side of the boat, she passes a MAN down on one knee in front of an EXCITED WOMAN, who nods, accepting his proposal.You know, we're kind of running ou ons.What makes you think it ever wilWhat do you mean?But then we'd have to find the Gales. don't know anything about them.What?\"You have to know where they are and h to get in-\"Oh shoot. You know what Jane? I've actually gotta jump off right now.Mine's totally shot too.Yeah, but we can't get in looking like this, Phil.Excuse me? Men shoot her a fierce look.Um... do you know which is the way back to Kansas? They eye her, then inspect Phil up and down. One of them LUNGES, and Phil jumps back... but he's moving aside some trash cans, revealing a RAINBOW COLORED STAIRWAY going down.Thanks any-way. With a sigh, Clara starts away from the bar, when sheExcuse me. Does she work here?Do you know where I can find her?Ray?Do you remember where it is?Phil! Clara, looking amazing in her red flapper dress, weeds through the crowd. Mr. Rivers and George take her in, obviously impressed.Phil, we gotta go. I found out where-are you bent over like that?Excuse me. In the corner, Clara raises her hand. Ray eyes her strangely.Sorry. I have to pee.I don't think anything about you. I just want this to be over.Oh God! Are you hit?Phil! Careful! Phil WHIPS the car around another bend.Please, Phil! It's not going to do any good if you-What? That's insane!Huh?Phil, this is-What? You just said spin the wheel, Phil! You didn't say which way.No you didn't!Why stay on Michigan?Doing what? What are you doing?!? Clara glances over her shoulder. Their heading strai toward a CONCRETE STAIRWAY.35 percent. Fine.What? Clara turns around to look. LIGHTS FLASH as a BARRIER comes down across the road - A DRAWBRIDGE ahead is slowly rising. Phil looks behind - the Towncar's got them closed in. The Black Dude peeks back as well, then turns to Phil.Excuse me? What are you talking about, \"pop you guys up and over?\"What? Sucking in a breath, Phil hands control of the car back to the Black Dude. As the conjoined cars zoom toward the drawbridge, Phil CRAWLS ON THE ATTACHED HOODS FROM ONE WINDSHIELD TO THE OTHER, sitting next to Clara.Phil, don't even think of it.No, Phil. We can't! It's suicide!I want to make sure that at least one our son's parents survives tonight!You almost just got us killed!There's a difference between fleeing from people shooting at you and knowingly driving a car in reverse over an open drawbridge!Poor Phil! You have i so bad, don't you!I'm inconsiderate? I'M INCONSIDERATE?!? Have you ever seen our bathroom in the morning after Tsunami Phil's blown through? The floor! The sink! You use my toothbrush.I want my own toothbrush, Phil! Sue me! And how many years have I asked you to do a simple thing like put the toilet paper in right?After ten years of asking you to have roll the right way, you still can't do it!What? Phil, I do not \"steal\" the comforter. It just happens when we're-Don't you point that at me!I do not leg lock the comforter!u think I don't know your little icks? Where you leave like half a thimble of milk in the carton and put it back in the fridge so you don't have to be the one to \"finish\" it and replace it?Because you don't want to haul your ass to the market to buy it yourself!Poor Phil. I feel so sorry for you. I must be hard having to be the cool fun parent while I get to be the one who makes sure our child's fed, clothed andUrgh! You know w sometimes I don't pay attention to you, Phil? Because you give me a headache! Clara angrily rummages through her purse then lets out a frustrated sigh.Screw you, Phil!What are you talking about, screwed with your job?Why didn't you tell me?I can't believe that's what you think do.This... this... this...So much for \"Mr. Squeaky CleaThey knew it was an election year and he would have to pay them whatever they asked.So he sent his guys to the restaurant to intercept the Gales and get the photos.What?can.Oh, we're guests of Apartment 605 The Doorman picks up the phone to call the apartmenAre you crazy? It's 4 in the morning! We were lust out for dinner. Trust mePlease. Just look at us! The Doorman looks at Phil and Clara - a white, well dressed suburban couple.Yarn? Fine. Just use that. I'll start looking. Phil gets to work, wrapping the yarn over and over, tying Cardigan's arms to the back of the chair, while Clara searches Cardigan's desk.Partner!If you're done tying her up, come over and help. Phil crosses the room and starts going through notebooks on the desk.Partner!Got it! She notices Phil's expression.Oliver told her he's being mean to Je y Briggs because... he says he wants to marry her?Let's make the call,(stunned', You and the Mayor are on a first name basis?Charlie?!? Lucy!?!? _ appened to \"\u00c2\u00b0boundaries matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009e =_.h? What happened to that, bitch?is it? Phil's concentrating hard on something. Thinking.Man, I love this city. Always have.Probably the last time we were here.Man, I'm starving!Who needs white truffles when you've got a lemon zest Luna bar. Clara breaks it in two and hands half to Phil. They click the halves together, toasting each other, then silently chew, looking out. Phil shakes his head and starts GIGGLING.What?en why are you laughing?You see! It isn't even there at all! I don't even have a plane! No plane! I'm running on fumes!I'm not trying to be uptight, or controlling! Or a nutrition...Nazi! I'm just trying the only way I know how to keep everything from fall apart!That's because as it is you see us as a distraction from your work!That's crazy, Phil. You do. You're a god man. You're the best man I know.I don't think I would really want to be with that guy, Phil. I just... want us to be on the same team again. As Clara sniffles, Phil takes this in for a beat. He nods.Phil, we were angry-Yeah, we did. You know the worst part about not talking about all this recently?We missed out on a lot of make up sex. And our make up sex woulda rocked!Oh yeah. Phil s when he spots something behind Clara. MAYOR DIGGS looks both walks from his car in the parking lot toward the--.1 hold it.Then we got to talking and realized how dumb we were.E If you came on to some waitress at the Rainbow, you must have

Making up for, you know, all you \"Phil\"-i-stines in the suburbs. Holbrooke chuckles. Phil's about to say something when a look from Clara reminds him to bite his lip. Holbrooke gestures to some cardboard furniture.So have a seat. Holbrooke starts to sit down himself, then makes a show of taking a LARGE GUN out of his shoulder holster and putting it on the table.Yeah. I'm supposed to sleep with her under my pillow.Yeah, unfortunately, Terrence Stockton is not a man you want to get on the wrong side of.He's like a Nicaraguan turtle - keeps his head deep in his shell unless he absolutely has to stick it out. Those photos must be really important to him.Officially, he runs a bunch of these exclusive private clubs downtown where his high powered friends go to let their hair down. Has one place called Le Passage, another called The Rainbow-Wouldn't be Stockton's pattern to risk ing this any larger than it is.

Pulling a terrified Holbrooke, Phil and Clara back toward the rear exit of the building. They try the door, but it's locked.What?Seriously, Phil. I'm a bad shield. I promise.Uh, they were on the keychain.Across the bridge a few blocks down that street there's an entrance to the Green Line subway. Get on it and you can get anywhere in this city. Phil and Clara look at him, confused.Listen, if you just leave me here I can tell them you ran the other way. It'll buy you time to get there. And maybe I can work on clearing all this up for you. Phil and Clara look at each other, then start to run away. Suddenly Phil stops, thinking.Thanks, Phil. As Phil runs back, Clara takes in the nice gesture of husband.Tha be from me.
