After they give you the gold watch.You don't fish.You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?No thanks. I got close but it never woulda worked.What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.She wanted to cook me breakfast.Nah, let's just take a look-see.Ow! Son-of-a-bitch.Yeah, just a nick ...Drop it!Tell them to drop it - now!Don't talk.It don't work-Captain...Sir, I--I want to work this.But sir--Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.I'll do it.I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.Where are they?Officer Reilly, vice.-Where?Thanks.Bomb Squad.You the Bomb Squad?Reilly, Vice. I-Who's in charge here?Look, it's important.It's about this.Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...What?What do you mean?Thanks.Captain-A ticking bomb...It's detonation cord, for a bomb.I'll do it.Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.Yes, sir.We just got a bomb threat upstairs.We can start in the area where the robbery occurred.Captain assigned me to assist you.What're you talking about?We've got one hour. Are you coming or not?You touch me again and--Sir...What was-? Why...?What?Now wait just a fucking-Mike Reilly.What kind of bomb was it?Huh?So you're the \"Device Squad\"... and you defuse \"devices\"?Anything else I should know?I'll get back to you.I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.Where's the girl? The one I brought in.Any luck?Captain said I could give it a crack.She was my collar. Maybe I'll get lucky. But, if you got a problem with that, talk to the Captain.You remember me.Let me be very clear about this. The police won't let you go. When your boyfriend realizes this, I have a feeling a lot of innocent people are going to die. Kids, families. I know you don't want that to happen.A what?She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?Where...?All of you, shut the fuck up!Hey, look--Oh yeah? Prove it.The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.I don't know. You tell me?You mentioned something called Redstone.Cream of the crop, huh? You?Sounds like terrorist heaven.Just how easy is it to build a... device?Girl was here. The guy in charge was over there with one of his men, the other one was back there.Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.Yep.Look, it's a longshot...Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?T.J., what're you doing?Someone who smokes French cigarettes.`Til we get a better lead.Insurance?What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.You guys seem pretty tight.Why do you do it?Looks like Pooch's doing okay.There he goes. He was here the whole time.Say, thanks for the back up--You heard him, get the fuck away, it's a bomb!So cut both.Which one's which?No, I'm with you.Nothing. Nothing traceable.Got work to do, don't we?Report on the case so far.Yes, sir.Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.`Night...What?Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since.I terrible with mechanical things.It's working.Okay, hit it.Don't bet on it.How's the print coming?Damn.No thanks, Bev.Yes, sir.I didn't. But I had to try.Yes, sir.Yes, sir.Hello.But they weren't all insured.Who is he?Taylor's dead.Thank you.Then why tell me?Be right back.No, of course not... well, thanks anyway. Here you go, Your Highness.You're beautiful!We're back in business!Glass, there they are. Pooch right in front of you, you got `em, you got `em.My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?I promised her she'd be safe.It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...I know.Glass--!C'mon, move it.Dispatch, this is Reilly.Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.Just do it.T.J., it's Reilly, put Glass on!Where you guys at?Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.Would you?Me, too.Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.All units, suspect spotted heading down alley behind Grand Hotel.Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!Glass, you guys take cover, goddammit!Fuck factor?What do we do?Talk to me. Let's assess.C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!Nothing.Keep talking.Wires... metal, cold... something soft...More metal... sharp edge...Something round, two wires ...What's wrong?Make up your mind, trigger.Yeah, another round thing.Which one's which?What... ?How the hell do you feel yellow?Thanks.Thank you, Captain.Nice to be here.", "clean_line": "look talking old man gotta sleaze ll gold watch fish outta city fish water family talk lately thanks got close woulda worked talking purring like kitty work cut loose wanted cook breakfast nah let look ow son bitch yeah nick drop tell drop talk work captain sir want work sir looks like stuff dad use blow tree stumps scranton ll looking bomb squad officer reilly vice thanks bomb squad bomb squad reilly vice charge look important girl wrist suspect mean thanks captain ticking bomb detonation cord bomb ll look saw guys yes sir got bomb threat upstairs start area robbery occurred captain assigned assist talking ve got hour coming touch sir wait fucking mike reilly kind bomb huh device squad defuse devices know ll sorry detective type girl brought luck captain said crack collar maybe ll lucky got problem talk captain remember let clear police won let boyfriend realizes feeling lot innocent people going die kids families know want happen talking obviously ve seen devices shut fuck hey look oh yeah prove place combed forensics pulled sets prints inside know tell mentioned called redstone cream crop huh sounds like terrorist heaven easy build device girl guy charge men ll blow play yep look longshot nitro cellulose kind explosive mean record matches smokes french cigarettes til better lead insurance bad ve got series bombs devices connected set nutjobs linked minutes ago waiting miracle ahead guys pretty tight looks like pooch okay goes time thanks heard fuck away bomb cut traceable got work report case far yes sir mike thanks fine night pittsburgh years ago partner died gung ho usual know working drug ring deep cover played pulled wasn cop anymore fiance dumped thing knew street doped auditioning morgue tough old vice cop cleaned gave second chance promised captain winters look guess realize needed kept straight tough second terrible mechanical things working okay hit bet print coming damn thanks bev yes sir try yes sir yes sir hello weren insured taylor dead thank tell right course thanks highness beautiful business glass pooch right got em got em god going use aren promised safe won work ll know trap know glass mon dispatch reilly patch bomb squad reilly glass guys catch alert haul cuz got girl leaving town glass eighth street alley grand hotel cut units suspect spotted heading alley grand hotel later close got bastard ll pinned guys hurry glass guys cover goddammit fuck factor talk let assess mon talk talking wires metal cold soft metal sharp edge round wires wrong mind trigger yeah round thing hell feel yellow thanks thank captain nice"}, "GLASS": {"raw_line": "Who the heck're you?We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.Alright boys, look close. Let's assess.It's a \"girl\" !Where did you get this?High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.Sorry about that. That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.Hey wait a minute-Bev, you're the greatest...Alright, let's check it out.Easy, guys.When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.Call upstairs, see what you can find out.T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.He's with us.Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner. Coming?That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.Treat. We treat devices.Don't push it, slick.C4, plastic explosive.Lemme see that.Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.It's from an IRA.I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?Only once, at Redstone.Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us \"punks\" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.Drive.Then let's go see what they missed.So what were they doing here?An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.With a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever watch MacGyver?Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.This is where the van was parked.Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...Bingo!Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...A bowling alley.Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area.Pooch, why don't you e-mail your buddies at Langley and on the other side of the pond, see if any IRAs been popping up lately?We work fast enough for you?How long are we going to stay?Political.Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?Right.It's a small fraternity, everyone knows everyone. I'm always recruiting. Pooch is ex- D.O.D., military expert... claymores, grenades. He played linebacker at Boston College, worked a K-9 unit - that led him to the Bomb Squad... great nose, lousy fingers, we try to keep him away from the tickers. T.J. is a heck of chemist, Texas A&M engineering degree. Found him in a Militia chat room - turns out we were both monitoring the same groups. Bev is the natural born hacker, we stole her from dispatch. She had the Cave reorganized and ultra-high-tech in two months. Captain has no idea how much hardware she's \"found\" for us.We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things...He set one, the son-of-a...Alright. Let's assess.Okay, I'm going in, nobody breathe.One shuts it down, one turns arms it.I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.Is this a great job or what?Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.How long were you hooked?You don't have to talk about it.Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.Your partner?Let me see.No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.Alright!Any word?Ex-girlfriend?What's up?Driving in circles, waiting for-How do you know?Should we head for the Interstate?No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...You got it.Reilly! He's loaded!Reilly, he's got enough to do it.Hold on to that thing tight.Off the scale.Can you hold it?Right.He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote. Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.Good, now the other side.Okay, let's go in.Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel.Don't touch that.Stay to your left.That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.Ease your thumb over to the right - feel anything?Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.I don't know.When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.No excuses, just do it!All clear, but we need an ambulance!You're late.", "clean_line": "heck bit busy moment ll statement minutes alive alright boys look close let assess girl high grade det cord girl got strange taste jewelry demolition sorry inch stuff imagine thing hey wait minute bev greatest alright let check easy guys need love shunned rest department upstairs run trace pin came people let hope talk hope mind captain help catch guys sooner coming cop bought tell partner let straight favor exactly guy want explosives isn bumper cars brain surgery wanna work way understand cool men trust strangers try swear unattractive way glass pooch use word bad luck treat treat devices push slick plastic explosive lemme unlikely probably cash register wrong come cash register ira device deadliest class tickers existence computerized multiple sensors booby traps works showed series bombings london couple years ago boys tripped went complicated timers girl irish redstone relax pooch ticker personal nice performance learn mike ditka sensitivity seminar look mister calling men names bad morale second punks happen know heck alot police work vice cop drive let missed abandoned machine shop nice place build devices low rent rice ruined perfect hideout redstone army training center alabama send cream crop learn tickers class west point thank redstone half course learned build devices second half apart firecrackers hydrogen bombs guys class names like john smith jones ahead hall wouldn turn funny thing disappear half course little training house stuff bathroom kitchen finish alleged car heck watch macgyver typical profile usually losers nobodies afraid confront victims like scaring people threats mentality obscene phone callers ninety ninety percent baloney power trip damage scares guy sophisticated blow wants disappear worst bunch love challenge creating wildest device love carnage van parked gotta bingo industrial wood oil separately things lead directions bowling alley hey matches big thing line work bev em bowling alleys supply area pooch mail buddies langley pond iras popping lately work fast long going stay political bad bomb squad eh right small fraternity knows recruiting pooch ex military expert claymores grenades played linebacker boston college worked unit led bomb squad great nose lousy fingers try away tickers heck chemist texas engineering degree militia chat room turns monitoring groups bev natural born hacker stole dispatch cave reorganized ultra high tech months captain idea hardware ve gotta business exactly alot outside commitments know strange best career path bug beat things set son alright let assess okay going breathe shuts turns arms know old saying doubt cut yellow wire great job meg lasagna good eats reilly mon long hooked talk tip bomb boys assess second partner let understand tell congratulations built ticker alright word ex girlfriend driving circles waiting know head interstate slip past hotel district greyhound got reilly loaded reilly got hold thing tight scale hold right timer going case got hold remote okay run fingers edges feel sensor good okay let close eyes feel fingertips tell feel touch stay left blasting cap good okay grab base pull straight wait easy gotta cap maybe ease thumb right feel okay caps turns shuts know doubt pull yellow wire excuses clear need ambulance late"}}}
