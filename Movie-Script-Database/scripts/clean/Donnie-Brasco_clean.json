I thought we agreed about you going back on the street again.What does that mean, undercover?Will you come home at night ?Will you be home on the we ekends?Y ou waited till this was all decided. You never asked me--you k new what I was going to say. What do you want from m e, Joe?Don't ask Daddy those questions.He'll try his best.What'd you tell her?You be proud of what your father does. Do y ou underst and me? Your father is an outstanding individual.You said it was going to be six months, Joe. CUT TO:Joe?I had no idea you were coming home. I'm supposed to go to the movies tonight with the Grants. She enters the bathroom as he wipes the shaving cream off his face. He looks up, half his moustache SHAVED OFF. Her face FALLS.Oh, Joe, don't-- Forget it.I liked your moustache. It's the only thing I liked about this thing of yours.I want you to ask me.What would you suggest I do--tell Berada to get a message to you that I like your moustache?I have to ask you about every frigging thing. She jockeys for room at the mirror to put on her makeup.They were supposed to pick me up five minutes ago.Why don't you come?I'm not cancelling. Agitated, he starts to compulsively organize the medicine chest, the shelves.Joseph--I think I'd remember.Sherry's sleeping over at Mom's, she's teaching her how to sew. Kerry's at choir practice.She's with her boyfriend. Leave my stuff alone.K enny. Wha t are you worri ed about? I was 14 when we started dating.He's a nice kid. Nice family. He's on the wrestling team.Maybe I'11 shave my head next time-- see how you like it. A car horn HONKS outside. Donnie's rearranging grows more agitated...Leave my stuff alone.I don't give a shit about the m oustache. But if yo u're gonna live your life however the fuck you want then let me live mine.He's on the phone. The cheery hubbub subsides as the noise of Donnie's hollering CRESCENDOES in the next room...I want a divorce.I ' m serious.will you see a therapist?I can't sleep for six months, Joe. CUT TO:...He comes home at all hours of the night, without announcing when or why, or where he's been for three weeks. Or three months. Then he expects everything to be just the way he wants it. Be vacuums the entire house. Do you know another man who vacu ums? It's abno rmal. Of course, he expects the girls to drop their lives when he shows u. . .They think it's a Jehovah's witness. You'd think he'd tell me where he goes or w ha t h e' s d o in g--Hal I know he's ch ea t in g o n m e--No, why don't you just leave? That's what you're good at.I nev er go o ut any mor e.

Because otherwise I'd rather not discuss it anymore.Who are you risking your life for? Not me, Joe.You're an animal.You're an animal1 Animal1 Donnie tries to fend her off while he drives. The car swings wildly. Approaching the opposite way:I hope those guys you're hanging out with are laying you because I ' m not anymore! He looks at her. She looks at him. And theyDo it.

My n ights are homework and basketball games. What are your nights?I don't know a goddam thing.I live like a widow, Joe. That's the only way I can deal with this, with the photographs and memories and our children, and I go on with my life. Like you're already dead.It's not protecting me--it's killing me. CUT TO:what? Go to sleep.I ' m sorry to run out, honey. I hav e an aero bics class . Tak e care of yourself. She gives him a peck on the cheek, exits. Donnie turns to the girlsFuck you. Fuck fuck fuck you.

Mo ve where?Those people are known as 'friends,' Joe. You told me when we started this that we'd be moving back close to the family. That was the deal.Well, Mr. 'Anderson', you've topped yourself. Where'd you get that name-- 'Father Knows Best'?Apparently there's nothing to discuss. I'm going to get the mail.You know the US government? The one you're doing this patriotic work for, that we can all be proud of?The IRS. We got audited. CUT TO:I think so. What's the matter?What profile? Joe, you're scaring me.That would apply to every teenager in America.Where did you find that?You don't have to tell me, Joe.You know, Jules called me this wee k. Do you know they 're looking for you?I'm not changing the subject. You're the subject, Joe. You're becoming like them.You don't see it. Donnie turns, heads up the stairs, Maggie following.How do you know it isn't mine? Donnie stops a beat. RAGE drumming up inside him, rage that CRESCENDOES as heI could hear your cheap shoes all the way down the hall.S ca re d. Al one .You mean did Joe see me?He'll never come out.Joe? He wouldn't have the imagination. I wish he'd become a gangster--at least we could pay our frigging bills.Do you know what this is about, J ules? Thi s is about a promotion.Not from you--from them. He wants to be a made guy.For years I tried to figure out what m ade Joe t ick. And t hen I finally figured it out--there's nothing ti cking. He' s got his rules and he's gonna live by his rules . The job is the job . Start what you finish. When he's in the FBI he wants to be the best and when he's in the Mafia h e wants t o be the\"b est--like it's all some frigging basketball game.
