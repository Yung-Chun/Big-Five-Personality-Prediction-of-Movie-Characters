{"Bodyguard": {"FRANK": {"raw_line": "Freeze! ANGLE - DOORWAY TO GARAGE A uniformed chauffeur freezes in his tracks. Farmer lowers his weapon and speaks.Call 911.Sometimes. It's just adrenaline.I saw him washing the car.They don't wash cars on the parking levels. He hands a glass of brandy to Frank, who looks at it.I'm not good in permanent positions, my feet go to sleep. The two men smile at each other. They raise their glasses in a joint salutation -- Klingman drinks. Frank doesn't.I don't do celebrities.Isn't she the one who collects dolls? This is enough to distract Devaney from his knife-throwing.You mean she doesn't collect dolls?I thought I knew who she was. Devaney tries to size up whether Frank is kidding him or not. Frank's face betrays nothing. Devaney gestures with a knife.Deadly.There are several good men available for that kind of money. Have you talked to Fitzgerald or Racine? Portman?There's no such thing.All right. I'll come and I'll look the situation over. If I take it, it's three thousand a week.Shit. Devaney's face drops. Frank examines the next knife.I know it's something like... The second knife gets away from him at the top of his arc and disappears into some bushes about three feet from Devaney. Devaney stands up in a hurry and moves behind Frank.Sorry. Frank raises his hand to throw again, then stops and motions Devaney off to the side.Better not stand right behind me. Devaney smiles weakly. Frank lets the third knife go with one smooth motion. The knife sinks an inch into the center of the post. THUMP. Frank's hand arching again. Throwing the remaining knives. Both knives stick in the post forming a straight vertical line with the first one.Frank Farmer to see Miss Marron.Alexander Graham Bell to see Miss Marron!The atomic number of zinc is 30.Are you the man on the intercom?My name is Edison. I have an appointment with Miss Marron.Mr. Devaney.What happened to your arm?Henry Ford, to see Mr. Devaney.Yes.What did you expect?This is my disguise.Orange juice.Miss Marron...There's been a mistake. A misunderstanding. If you'll show me the quickest way out, we'll save each other a lot of trouble. Frank's on his way. Someone brings a silver headpiece on a stand to Rachel. She ignores it, still looking at Frank.We did. Frank starts to walk off. Devaney is grasping at straws.Hi.All right. How 'bout yourself?No. I don't like boats.Oh, I don't know.You're a smart kid. Fletcher nods.I'll tell you. One time I was stuck on a boat with some people for four months.Nope. A big white yacht. Do you know what a yacht is?Well, nobody's perfect. Fletcher squints up at him, the sun in his eyes.What do you know about it?I'll remember that. Devaney trots into the pool area, out of breath. He is holding a bulging manila file. As he sees Fletcher, he holds the file casually at his side. Frank sees Fletcher looking at the file.Nice meeting you. Fletcher looks after them silently.Have you ever tried having these professionally assessed? Devaney shakes his head no. Frank begins to look through the letters, flipping them by the corner of the page. From many different sources, some are scrawled, some typed, some assembled from cutouts. Many are soiled and torn, others immaculate. Occasionally, one will have a photo of Rachel with crude markings on it. Spector enters sucking on a popsicle. He comes to stand over Frank's shoulder, peering nonchalantly at the piles of letters.I was two years with Carter and four years with Reagan. Frank sets another letter in the center pile. He stops, smiling at it.This is a little old lady in Akron. She's written to everybody I've ever worked for. He continues to turn until something stops him. Several letters are paper-clipped together. They are the pasted- up type we saw being assembled on the desk top.Not on my shift. Spector emits a gratuitous laugh, acknowledges the joke.At first glance, these don't bother me. But keep them. You never know. He separates one letter from the others.This could be something. Devaney searches Frank's face.I don't know. Did you tell Miss Marron about it? Does she know about the doll? Devaney and Spector exchange looks. This is evidently a sore point between them.What about the police?What about the chauffeur?Is this her bedroom?No.Somebody was in here?And she doesn't know about this either? Devaney shakes his head.Someone penetrates the house, gets upstairs and jerks off on the bed ... I'd say that qualifies as a problem.This house is wide open.I said this house is wide openLook, I can't protect her. I won't be responsible for her safety if she doesn't know what's going on.Sure she will.Yeah. As they reach the car, Devaney is relieved. He dares a perfect smile.Devaney, if you ever lie to me again, I'll take you apart.I wanted to see how hard it was to get in.Put this on your arm. It'll help the ache. Henry takes it but is noncommittal.I'll bet you can fill up a whole day just washing the cars and driving Rachel Marron around town.We're adding to your duties.You're my new assistant. Frank removes three boxes of cartridges from the suitcase and puts them in the back of a dresser drawer as Henry watches.Henry, I've spent a lot of time guarding people all over the worldThe cocky black chauffeur. Henry considers this for a moment and smiles. OVER scenes 26-28, we hear the VOICE of CNN's MARTIN GROVE from \"Showbiz Today.\"Unusual tactic for a guard dog, but effective. Nicki smiles, gesturing him in.I'm sorry to disturb you.You and Rachel?You never went back?I don't want anyone on the street to be able to look at the cars and know who owns them. Henry leans in a doorway and hits a master switch. The three doors of the garage start to rise in sequence.Get new plates for those two.That's what her manager thinks.Yeah.Fine.Thanks. Ray?Why am I getting all this cooperation?I'm trying to keep her away from crowds.O.K. Henry, let's go. Tony looks at Frank, eyes narrowing. From across the street, we see the limo pull away. As the shot clears, the dark shape of another vehicle appears, slowly moving into frame over the top of the camera.No problem. I'd like to know how you handle things, Tony.Turn left.Shortcut. FRANK'S POV - TOYOTA IN REARVIEW MIRROR As the limo turns, the 4 X 4 follows them into the turn. ANGLE - FRANK whispers to Henry.Slow down, very slow.No, just slow down. The car slows. ANGLE - SPECTOR AND RACHEL IN BACKStop here... Take them to the house. Frank jumps out and jumps a hedge, racing toward the lawn and work area. ANGLE - TONY, RACHEL AND SPECTOR As the car pulls away they see Frank running wildly across the property.Keep this loose. Fletcher comes to take a look too. He peers up at Frank, expectantly.Toyota. Black.One snag though. Fletcher's face falls.360,000 of them in Los Angeles. I checked. Nice work, though.Yeah, she makes him nervous. They watch as Devaney SCREECHES to a STOP, gets out and hurries inside.Did he have an appointment? Devaney turns to him.I don't want her doing anything she's always done.We're almost done.Go on Tuesday this week. Spector looks at him as though he were a Martian.I've seen a few.You can be as you choose to be. It's an act of discipline sometimes, but it can be done. Rachel stops in her tracks... then opens the curtains and looks at herself in the mirror. Also reflected in the mirror is Frank.That's right. Rachel turns to Frank.You're too clever for me. I can't keep up. Frank continues to search the shop and street with his gaze. Rachel steps closer to him.Disapproval's a luxury I can't afford. Gets in the way.That's right. It's a stand-off. After a moment, Rachel motions to an outfit on a rack just behind him.I'm here to keep you alive... not to help you shop. Fuming, Rachel sizes things up, then grabs it herself, whipping the curtain shut behind her. A smile plays across Frank's face.I thought it was dinner.Are we going somewhere else?What's the Mayan? Spector starts to climb into the limo.Spector, you've got to tell me about these things.Rachel. He removes something from his pocket, a small enameled cross.I want you to keep this. Rachel looks at it, both flattered and confused.It's fitted with a radio transmitter. When you close the clasp, it sends a signal. If there's ever a problem and we're separated, just press it and I'll know you need me.They didn't tell you.Let's get her out of here.We should get her out of here. Right now!I can't protect her out there.He might be.Rachel... don't do it. It's not worth it...What? Spector's presence is a distraction. Frank steps to one side for a better view of Rachel. Spector moves too.You told me you were going to tell her. And you didn't.But she handled it fine. Frank continues to peer past Spector's shoulder, his vigilance undiminished. Soothed and nurtured by the obvious admiration of her audience, Rachel's fear is beginning to vanish. The song is taking over. Spector changes tack, becoming confidential, \"man-to-man.\"One word.One word in print about any of this... Spector nods, half-gasping. Frank tightens his grip. Frank's attention is drawn by a renewed roar from the crowd.Tony, not there.It's been a long night.I know why.I don't want to talk about this again.Hey.No. I'm afraid I'll have to jog with you. They both smile.That would be good. They walk in silence for few moments. When Rachel finally speaks, she sounds genuinely unsure of herself, nervous. It's very appealing. And if it's an act, she's a terrific actress.There's a big difference between wanting to die and having no fear of death. They walk down the sidewalk.What do you think?Yeah, it was a good movie. They walk off down the sidewalk.Sixty-two.Yeah.Absolutely.If someone is willing to swap his life for a kill, nothing can stop him.He might get me instead.That's my job. Rachel looks at him.I can't sing.You mean like you? It's a matterThat happens.It happens. A beat.What do you mean?A long time ago.Do you mind if I don't answer?Nobody's perfect. Rachel is taken aback.No... Nice try though. It was less dramatic than that. She didn't love me anymore. Can you imagine such a thing?Yeah. A beat, then Rachel bursts out laughing.What?It is, isn't it. Suddenly a dish drops to the floor. Frank, still dancing, makes a smooth quick turn that puts his body between Rachel and the noise. His head turns to locate the source of the noise.End.No. Fast. Rachel puts down her drink and moves toward a samurai sword that is mounted in its scabbard on the wall. She looks at it, peering closely.Money. Rachel looks around at Frank's modest home.Watch yourself. Rachel slides the scabbard off. The naked blade is breathtaking. Rachel holds the sword out before her. She walks toward Frank, then stops and looks over the blade at him.Watch this. He has raised the scarf over his head, in the space between them. With two hands he spreads it out and then lets it go. Slowly, billowing, the scarf floats down over the blade and is cut in two. These two pieces float slowly to the floor. Frank takes Rachel's wrist and moves the sword away to the side. They are both holding it as Rachel presses her body against Frank's and they begin to kiss.Right now it might not be so hard. Rachel laughs, kisses him and buries her head down into his shoulder. Frank stares across the bed at the samurai sword lying on the floor. Some of Rachel's clothing is draped in a heap across it. The torn pieces of her scarf lie nearby. HOLD ON Frank's look. SHOCK CUT TO: INT. FRANK'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING The roller-blind is raised with a sharp, snapping sound. Frank is moving around the room, getting dressed. RachelRachel, I don't want to get confused about what I'm doing here.You pay me to protect you, that's what I do. Rachel sits up.No, nothing.No, I want you to do without. She stops.I want to keep it straight in my head what job I'm doing.No, I'm sorry. This is my fault.You didn't do anything. It was me. I involved myself with my client.I made a mistake.Christ! I've told you why. I can't protect you like this.Yeah...You can live with that or you can fire me.I've spent a lot of time learning not to react to things like other people do. It's my job. But it doesn't always work, Fletcher... it doesn't always work.I'm an old man compared to you, pal, and I don't understand either. And I'm starting to get the feeling I never will. There's a crunch of footsteps behind him. He looks around. With a big flourish, a copy of Daily Variety is put down in front of us, front page upwards.Don't you ever say what's on your mind? Spector cannot believe he's being so addressed -- especially in front the staff. The assistants stop in their tracks and look.That's between us.No. I understand. Spector stiffens, then decides not to take this one on.It's on the twentieth floor in the south wing. There's a service elevator right there. Mainly ocean windows. Should be no problem.Thuringer.Okay. Let's go.What a silly job this is.Is this really necessary?Portman.Orange juice. It's been awhile. You on the job?How old is she?Yeah.Surprised?I never doubted your skills.What happened!Why don't you go back there and keep watching? Frank looks at Rachel's doorway, sipping his juice.Go to sleep. Frank looks out at the ocean. After a pause, in the background, Mark slips inside the Katz suite.Give me a break, will ya? I didn't tell you to fuck everybody in the hotel!Yeah, well, don't take too long, Ray.Where is she? Where's Tony?Thuringer, this is Farmer. Where's your man on the door to the suite? Well get someone up here.He doesn't know. They look at each other, worried. Frank walks out onto the balcony, looks round and down, comes back in. He heads for the front door.I'm gonna check the route. As usual. He opens the front door. A uniformed guard is standing outside. Frank goes out and closes the door.Gomez! Louis Gomez! He waits impatiently. No one comes. Two quick steps and he is back at the CRATES, throwing them violently into the corner where they CLATTER loudly to the floor. Frank walks on along the corridor.What are you doing?Move it. The Enormous Cuban gets slowly up from the boxes. He towers over Frank.I'm sorry. Frank steps away, rubs a hand through his hair, tries to collect himself. He's standing amidst dumpsters and discarded food boxes. He looks up and sees a marquee. RACHEL MARRON. TONITE. BENEFIT CONCERT. 8 P.M.I'm through. I'll get you back to L.A. and that's it. The guy with Fletcher can cover you till you get a replacement.I don't care.Save it, Devaney. The people who hire me don't have to be convinced to save their own lives. Frank reaches the sliding door that leads to the balcony.Call me when she's ready to go down.I can't protect you like this. It's impossible. The odds are on his side.I want to take you away for a while. Rachel nods.Somewhere people don't know about. She nods again, agreeing.No Spector or Devaney or Tony. He looks at her, reading her face for any hesitation. There is none.If you cross me up this time, I'll kill you myself. Rachel smiles, weakly but with obvious relief.Lake's a little low.Just one.He's a trained noisemaker.I don't like big dogs. They don't know who they're eating.I don't want anyone going out in it until you've checked it over first. Okay? Every time. Henry nods.Every time. In the distance, Rachel and Fletcher have just reached the house where Nicki scoops up Fletcher and spins him round and round in a circle. She hugs him close and kisses his hair. After a few moments, Fletcher squirms free and runs to catch up with Rachel.Portman sometimes had trouble remembering what his job was. Supper's ready. We can see from Rachel's face that she feels embarrassed about her behavior in Miami.Oh, for Chrissake! I'm going to tell her about the time you stripped in court.If you're lucky, maybe he'll tell you about my first jockstrap. As he speaks, he peers out through the window at the lake. We hear Herb's voice continue from the other room.Three years. Nicki takes the bowl of popcorn and squats down with it beside Fletcher. Fletcher peers intently at the board as he chews on a handful.What do you think? Fletcher finishes a mouthful of popcorn, wipes his mouth.City kid.Good night, Rachel. Rachel accepts this. She smiles in return and touches him on the arm, very tenderly.You follow all her moves this closely?No, it isn't. He moves away into the next room. She hesitates a moment, then follows.No.Why don't you change it?You're a lovely woman.I make my mistakes.No, don't go away, Nicki. Don't leave me with that. Tell me about it. Tell me how long you've been second. Tell me how she has a child and you don't. Tell me something. But don't turn away and try to stick it on me. Nicki twists in his grip. He holds her tight.Maybe I need it. I'm fed up with people telling me they have no control over their lives. If you hate your life so much, turn it around.Yes it is. You can walk out that fucking door anytime you want. I'll unlock it for you.Okay. It's not my business. He moves away, OUT OF FRAME. We HOLD ON Nicki, a long time.Raccoon... deer...? Herb nods. Their attention is drawn to soft singing up by the house.Where's Fletcher? Henry appears at the porch of the house, carrying a fishing rod as he comes out. At that instant, the sound of the OUTBOARD MOTOR CRACKLES through the air. Frank's head snaps toward the boathouse. Henry, in the distance, looks quickly at the boathouse, then to Frank.Fletcher! Fletcher!I'm sorry. I got careless. Henry looks at Frank. He feels terrible about not checking the boat.Back off. Henry moves away from the van. Frank inserts the key in the ignition.Both the cars are dead. And I can't see how it was done. Frank and Herb exchange a look.Who could know we're here? This place has nothing to do with her.We'll button down tonight and walk out at first light.I think this is no maniac. He knows what he's doing. There is a long, long silence. Nicki continues crying. Finally --Tell me about it. She doesn't reply.Who is it, Nicki?How do we stop him?Who is it? NICKIYou can call him off.How'd you do it?How?Name?Is it all paid for?He keeps going until he kills her? Nicki nods again, lowering her face into her hands.What's the name of the bar?How 'bout the letters?We will. You and me. Tomorrow we're going back to L.A. We're going to find the bar, we're going to find Armando. He starts to rise. She stops him.You told me. She has everything. Frank stands up and begins to move across the room. Nicki puts her face in her hands and is silent for one moment. Suddenly, Frank freezes, listening.Stay here. Don't move. Nicki's face shows true terror. Frank is out the door.Stay with Rachel! Henry's head appears round the doorway of Herb's room.Dad?Stay with Rachel! The DOG continues to BARK upstairs. Frank sees a slight movement outside and window to his right. A split-second moment of decision. He heads off rapidly down the hall, away from the open door.What do you mean?What? Where?You're sure it's him?Well, whoever you got down there wasn't here last night. This was a professional...How long can you keep him?Yeah, Fletcher, I'm okay. How 'bout you?Yeah, Fletcher, I do.Everybody's afraid of something, Flethcer. That's how we know we care about something, when we're afraid we'll lose it.I think you should try to go back to sleep now, pal.I'm afraid... of not being there... Fletcher stares at him, uncomprehending.It's late. Do you want me to take you back to your room? Fletcher shakes his head \"no,\" just barely. Then he disappears.He knows he still hasn't got you.It's possible.Maybe. Rachel takes this philosophically. She tugs at the grass, thinking.I think it's very dangerous.That's right. He looks at her a long time, then takes her in his arms. He kisses her and lays her down. His body moves over hers. Like a bodyguard, protecting her from the night.Tony knows what he's doing. Tony looks at Frank, surprised and not a little pleased with the unexpected support.I'm going to have a look around. I'll come back for her. Stay alert. Tony nods, watches Frank go.Portman. What are you doing here?Who?Tony, you there?Tony, I've got a feeling this is the night. I think he's gonna go for her in front of all the cameras. The kind of thing only a lunatic would do. That's how he wants it to look. Except he isn't a lunatic. He's very clever. I need you to help me.Tony stays. Skip looks at Rachel for a response.Where's Portman?Portman.Something's going on you should know about --Rachel, I know who it is. He's here tonight. I think he's...Tony, it's Portman. Remember? The guy from Miami... Spector grabs Tony's sleeve, pulling him back.How's it going?Yeah.I thought I might hole up with my dad. Finish that chess game. Rachel nods approvingly.That's the idea. Fletcher grins. Rachel starts to cry.So, how's the new guy?He's very good.I don't trust you.'Bye Rachel. Rachel turns quickly. She almost runs up the boarding ladder. Frank remains watching her. Fletcher looks back over his shoulder as they disappear into the plane.I won't be forgetting you either. She presses something into Frank's hand.", "clean_line": "freeze angle doorway garage uniformed chauffeur freezes tracks farmer lowers weapon speaks adrenaline saw washing car wash cars parking levels

show business people. Frank says nothing. His eyes are closed behind the sun- glasses. Devaney picks up one of the throwing knives. He holds it carefully by the blade and throws it. It misses the post by three feet and clatters against the fence. Frank opens his eyes, sees what's going on and closes his eyes again.Do you really do these things?Farmer, Rachel Marron is one of the most famous people in America. She's won every music award invented. She's got the number one song in the country right now and she'll probably be nominated for an Oscar in her veryYes. She collects dolls.You're probably deadly with these things, aren't you?Show me. Frank doesn't move.Why are you resisting this job? $2,000 bucks a week. $2,500.Yeah. Portman was interested... He senses an opening and sits down beside Frank for what he takes to be the first serious talk.... but we're told you're the best.Farmer, we're talking about a very frightened lady. With aOkay. You must be very deadly for three grand a week. Frank is now about twenty feet from the wooden post. He throws one of the knives. It misses the post and clatters against the fence.Rachel...Rachel, Frank Farmer is...It's terrific... Devaney is now facing the unseen Rachel.Rachel, Frank Farmer is here. Devaney nods in Frank's direction. Nicki looks at Frank.Frank Farmer. The bodyguard.Rachel, raise your butt out of there and meet this man. RACHEL MARRON finally rises from the sofa. It's a bit ofFrank Farmer, Rachel Marron. Rachel offers her hand and they shake. Rachel looks him up and down.This is Nicki, Rachel's sister and personal secretary.... Tony Scibelli. Tony nods but makes no move to shake hands. Rachel dismisses the Dress Designer.... Sy Spector, Rachel's publicist.Not like this.Honey, that's not going to be a problem.Rachel runs a very informal household, we're all on a first name basis... Spector has finished up on the phone and jumps in.Shut up, Tony.Farmer, will you wait a minute?Sy, I'm handling this. Rachel looks on coolly as Frank slides open the glass door.Farmer, will you wait a minute?Farmer, will you wait a minute? I should have told you more. I'm sorry but I was afraid she wouldn't go through with it. I thought I'd let the two of you work it out... come to an understanding.She's not a bad person, and whether she knows it or not, she needs you. You've come this far... Would you just wait here for one minute. I want to show you something. Please, Farmer. Devaney runs back to the house.How are you, Fletch? I'm glad you waited. Let's go over here.This is just in the last six months.You think it could be the same guy? The one who rigged the doll?Sy, I think we should show him the room.No. She sleeps in a room next to Fletcher's down the hall. Sy had this done for a magazine layout,Rachel never liked it.We found the letter here.Somebody broke in and ... masturbated on the bed.What do you think?What kind of problem?Frank, I totally respect what you're telling me. Tell me how you want to work and I'll accommodate you.I'll talk to her, I'll make her understand. I can do that....She won't give you any static, Frank, you've got my word on that. Frank is still focused on Fletcher.So what job's perfect? You're a bodyguard, aren't you? Slowly, Frank faces him.What is it now?No Sunday brunch. That's why you called me up here?Where is he? Nicki indicates through the glass door. Devaney walks over to it.Rachel, I'm getting goddamn sick of running up here every time he steps on your toes. Farmer! Would you come in here a minute?Farmer, what is this about brunch at Charlie's? Rachel's been going there every Sunday for the last five years.So are the guys he's protecting you from.What do you want from my life?He sent another one. Rachel immediately picks up on this.There were some letters before, Rachel... same kind of thing, threats, oddball stuff...... and somebody got into the house...Sy.Let's go home, Sy. We'll have to make an announcement.Excuse me... hello... I've got an announcement to make. I'm sorry but... due to circumstances beyond... Voices shout. \"Where's Rachel?\"... a groan begins. A chorus of boos fills the room. He raises his hands.I'm afraid that... A great gush of applause from the audience. Devaney's befuddled. He doesn't see Rachel walking up behind him.Rachel won't be able... Rachel stands beside him beaming. She bows. Claps back to her fans. Devaney retreats. Rachel gestures in his direction.Frank stays. Spector looks round, sees that Devaney and Rachel have been listening. Rachel is silent. With a curt nod of his head, Spector gestures to the assistants to leave the room. Devaney weighs in.With this high a profile, Rachel needs protection now more than ever. If he goes, you can forget Miami...Fuck the contract. If he goes, she's not singing a note. It's too dangerous.Do you know the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach? Frank nods.How does the Ambassador Suite compare to the Presidential for us? Frank thinks only for a moment.I don't know. I thought you were with her.Where are you going?Rachel, where the hell have you been?We were worried. You know you're not supposed to do that. Frank and Rachel look at each other.Rachel. Frank turns and heads for the door. Devaney looks at him anxiously.Farmer, where are you going?She got another call, while you were downstairs and she answered it herself. It was him, Frank. Same guy.Farmer, it really shook her up. She thought it was going to be Fletcher calling her from L.A. I think she'll be reasonable now.Farmer -- Frank goes out on the balcony and slides the door closed behind him.We'll go straight back to the Green Room. Right, Frank? Frank nods.Got that, Tony?That wasn't so bad. You okay? Rachel is in her own world. Devaney passes the word to get moving. The ENGINES WARM UP. Rachel turns and sees Frank still standing there looking at her. INT. COCKPIT - DAY The pilot's hand pushes forward on the throttle. EXT. PLANE - DAY The nosewheel starts to taxi.

The choreographer skips to the sofa and disappears from sight. Sound of kissing, laughter. The video rewinds on the big screen and the dancers gather round it expectantly.Sugar, that's gonna be great. I love the ending... Devaney moves to the front of the room. The PLAYBACK STARTS behind him. There are several overlapping conversations going on.Nicki, how'd you like the number? You like the end routine?I wanna see it all. Tony? I'll bet Tony loved it. The brawny man, Tony, shrugs and stands to look at Frank as he speaks.Don't worry, Rory. Tony doesn't appreciate great art. The pinned-up girl has been brought forward for Rachel's approval, elbowing Devaney a little to one side.Devaney, do you think this is me?Who's here?I think Rory should be my bodyguard. Let's see the back again...Well, I'm up.You don't look like a bodyguard.I don't know. Tough guy maybe.Well, his timing's good.The back's still not right... SPECTOR, still on the phone, offers a perfunctory wave.Can we get you a drink?Straight? Nicki. Nicki goes to the bar. Rachel sits and motions for Frank to sit opposite her.Rory, I'll be with you in a second. Rory gets up, and goes over to his dancers at the big screen video.Listen, this whole thing is Bill's idea... This sudden obsession with protecting me. Tony has always handled my security and we've done just fine.I'll be with you in a second. Nicki hands Frank his orange juice. She looks at Frank as she speaks.Relax guys, I said I'd do it. You see what I'm dealing with here? I'm willing to go along, as long as we all understand each other. I'm not going to let this alter my life one little bit. Who was this?I think I'm safe when I'm here at the house so I guess the main thing will be when I go out. Tony will be able to fill you in on all that. You two will have to work something out. I don't want both of you falling all over me everywhere I go. The most important thing is this -- I will not allow Fletcher to be affected by this thing...I don't want him to think he's in prison. So the house and grounds must not be altered in any way. He shouldn't be aware that you're here. Is that clear?Rachel.appears beside Fletcher, looks down there too, then leads her son purposefully away. Fletcher isn't happy about it.Fletcher! C'mon. Back in here! As she speaks, some workmen test the remote control on a window shutter. It descends in front of Rachel's face. She is not amused. Fletcher passes Frank on his way to join Rachel. He mutters almost under his breath.I'm surprised you didn't plug them.Shut up you assholes!You! You! Out! Out! Now! Out of here! Get out! Terrified, the Old Locksmith drops his tools and begins backing out of the room.Then you can take your tools with you. She turns to the window, in what she imagines is Frank's general direction, and, like a little girl, suddenly sticks out her tongue.I want him gone.That is not it! It's my money and my life and I want him out of here.He's through messing with my life.Did you know he was nuts?Who?'I don't want her doing anything she's always done.' The guy's a fanatic.Excuse me if I don't faint.Do you know he's got the phones bugged?Maybe he gets off listening to my calls. All that heavy breathing...I want some peace around here.And I want to be able to eat brunch with my friends.Louise, you've got too much great stuff.Wooo! Let me try this on. She flicks a glance to Frank; he's not looking at her. She pulls back the curtain of the makeshift changing booth, then stops dramatically.Farmer, do you want to come in here with me? Just to be safe? Frank glances at her, then resumes his surveillance of the shop. Rachel's head bobs up and down above the curtain as she changes.You probably won't believe this, but I have a reputation for being a bitch. Frank says nothing. He gazes outside through the store- front window and sees Henry and Tony horsing around next to the limo. A few small boys stand around the car. One of them is climbing onto the hood.I didn't used to be. But you get known for being a certain way -- a way people think you are -- and pretty soon you get like that. Can't help it. Frank smiles knowingly. Rachel notices.You don't think so? You're such an expert on famous people?And you disagree?That why you never stay with one of your clients? They too undisciplined for you? Or is it you're afraid you'll start to care about them?Can't you answer straight just once? Why don't you talk to me? I'm not such a bad lady.Look at me, Farmer! Frank turns and looks at her.You don't approve of me, do you?Don't like emotions getting to you, huh? Never mix business with pleasure?Grab that would you? Frank takes a beat. Looks out the window.Nice suit, Frank. Rachel is about to get in.For me? It's beautiful.What do you mean 'another one'? Frank quickly shoots a look at Spector.Tell me what?Someone was in my house?Someone was in my house?While Fletcher was there?No way anyone could what?Do you think he's out there? Devaney can't answer. She turns to Frank.He's here, isn't he?But you know he was in my house... oh my God.Wait...No fucking freak is gonna chase me off stage. She pulls away from him. Farmer starts after her, closely followed by Spector.Bill Devaney, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, Bill. Hey, everyone. Hello! Isn't Billy Thomas the greatest. He's asked me to sing a song. I hope you don't mind. The crowd roars its approval. Frank nervously scans the room. Rachel smiles and moves along the stage. MUSIC starts in the b.g. Masking obvious fear, she starts to sing. As she takes one hand from the microphone, her fingers tremble. She clasps it again to hide her anxiety.You like that? Would like to hear another? Billy?I think my feet are trying to tell me something... wanna see a new video? The crowd explodes. They know what song is coming. They start to move with Rachel.I want to dance... She skitters to the other side of the stage, baiting her fans. Her new video explodes across the video wall behind her. The crowd surges forward. Two security guards nervously tense up, watching the crowd. When one fan tries to climb onstage, Frank reaches out and unbalances him, so that the man falls back into the audience. Another man climbs the stage on the other side. One of the guards darts out like a ballboy at a tennis match, pushes the fan back and scurries to the far side to resume his vigilance. The crowd is getting even more excited, pressing closer, trying to touch Rachel. The security guards move in, but Rachel gestures for them to back off. ANGLE - FRANK Frank's task has suddenly become impossible. A forest of hands and faces start to engulf Rachel. Anyone could be the killer. Frank's eyes dart over them all, his gaze intense, as if trying to hold them off by sheer willpower.Aren't you going to ask me why I behave like that?Hey! Gotcha, didn't I?You're probably wondering what I'm doing. You didn't know I jogged, did you?What's the matter? 'Fraid I'll get picked off in my snazzy running suit?Great. I guess I can't do it. Rachel stops pumping, gasps for air, and for one moment, rests a hand on Frank's arm to support herself. She removes it quickly.Will you walk with me a little? Frank nods and they cut off across the grounds.I know this is kinda late, but thank you. I'm really glad you're here. I'm going to try to cooperate.Farmer... I have this problem. This minor little problem. You see, I'd like to go out for an evening. Just me and a guy. You know... ... like a 'date.' But I can't go out on a date because you have to be with me every minute. I mean, what if he invited me up to his place afterwards? Are you going to come, too? So the only thing I can figure is for you to take me out. So... that's what I was wondering ... you know. What do you think? But only if you want to. Frank is bemused.Only if you want to... I'm not so bad... God, this is embarrassing. I'm gonna run up ahead there. You decide. She runs up the hill to the pool area, which is now above them. He walks up after her.Tell her she'll have to wait, babe. I'm getting fixed up here. AT WINDOW - CLOSE ON NICKI She watches Frank and Rachel, her expression neutral. She turns away. Fletcher continues to watch his mother with Frank.Well, he didn't look like he wanted to die to me.And because he had no fear of death, he was invincible?Well, he sure creamed 'em all in the end.How many times have you seen it?Your kinda place?Your kinda music?You figure no one can get by you here?Great. What do I need you for?And you're ready to die for me?And you'd do it? Why?Maybe there's some glory in saving a president or something, but just anyone...I don't trust discipline. At the crucial moment I'd cop out.But not with you, Fierce Frank.Have you ever liked anybody?Like me -- a girl. Frank knows what she's driving at. But he's not at all happy to relinquish this information.What happened? Do you mind if I ask?I don't want to pry... Frank smiles at that.She didn't die did she? You weren't like... protecting her and she got killed? Frank is silent, grim. Rachel looks stricken.Oh, my god! That's it, isn't it?Oh Frank, I'm sorry.No, not really. A SONG comes on the JUKEBOX -- 'WHAT BECOMES OF THE BROKEN HEARTED.' Frank smiles as Rachel begins to sing.So, is this a full service date, Frank? Frank's wary.I'm just asking you to dance.You like this?I'm sorry... It's just that... It's so depressing. Now they're both laughing.Don't worry, I'll protect you. They drift back into the music, Rachel singing, Frank watching.It's very quiet here. She walks to some shelves -- a random selection of books, football and karate trophies, framed citations and other memorabilia. She glances at a dusty framed photo of a football team.West Virginia University Football. God, look at you. She looks at Frank, quizzically.What'd you play?Were you tough?You some kind of a samurai, too?They said you were in the Secret Service. What made you get out? Frank moves away and sits on a sofa against the wall.I can see your tastes are extravagant. She looks at Frank and then back at the sword. She reaches out to touch it.May I? Frank nods. Rachel takes it off its mount carefully, unhooks the scabbard and begins to slide it off.You're a hard one to figure, Frank Farmer. He stares at her. She steps closer, so the blade is only about a foot from his face.It seems to me a bodyguard must know little peace. Frank stands up so that the point of the sword is only about an inch from his chest. He reaches out over the blade to Rachel's neck and unties the silk scarf she is wearing there. One hand draws the scarf away. The other hand lingers for a moment on her neck, then lifts away.I've never been this safe before. Frank smiles.No one could get by you.What? What is it? What are you doing?Frank?I'm not confused. Frank finds his shoes.What? Have I done something wrong?Then what is it? She lifts the sheet seductively and looks over the top of it.Do you want me to beg?What's going on, Frank?And what is that exactly? Making me feel like shit?Don't apologize for godsake. Just tell me what I did. I'm a big girl.Your \"client\"?What mistake?... You don't find me attractive anymore.And what? That's it for me?I don't believe it. He automatically checks the gun as he slips it into the holster.But I can't fuck you. Frank turns and looks at her. This is hard for him, too.I don't believe this... I'm asking you?... Let me tell you...Frank stays. Spector considers her for a beat, then looks at the others. The secretary interrupts from the back of the office.Hang around, Farmer. We might need your vaunted expertise. She reaches forward and hits a button on Spector's desk, throwing the call onto a speaker.Hello, Ben honey.Ben. I hear you've got me in the annex next to the kitchen.Quit bitching, Farmer. This is the part you do get paid for. Rachel sweeps out the door. The camera crew hurries to keep up with her.Oh my God. Look what they're wearing. Mother, hide your eyes... Heads turn to look.I couldn't wear that suit... Honey, you're naked... Of course, if I had a body like that... There is a murmur of recognition from some of the guests. She pauses to shake a hand, and now all the guests throughout the pool area are aware that Rachel Marron is among them. People stand on chairs, scramble for pens and paper, runYou look like a man of good taste to me. Come to my party tonight. Ben, make sure this boy gets to my party. Schiller nods. Rachel glances at Frank, making sure he gets the point, and then she's off again. The throng gets tighter. Frank's having to work harder, steering her towards the door back into the hotel. The familiar chant starts up: \"Rachel, Rachel.\" It's starting to resemble the frenzy of the opening scene. This time, amid the thrusting hands and clamoring faces, a few bewildered elderly guests look dazed as they are shoved forward. A child starts crying, lost in the mess of legs and Bermuda shorts. A distraught mother tries to reach him. Someone is jostled into the pool as the crowd surges again. Amid the chaos, whistles and scattered applause. Rachel drinks it all in.Thank you. Thank you. Come tonight and give till it hurts. With a final surge, Frank makes it to the door with his party. The door closes shut behind them. A mass of distorted faces pushes onto the glass. The party walks on briskly.I'm beginning to wonder about your judgement, Sy. Why do I have to keep paying my dues if I've already arrived?Now you're going to tell me about magic? Give it a rest will ya...Thank you. Thank you. You're so right.That's orange juice! Rachel gives Portman an approving once-over.Who are you?I take it you've met my bodyguard?Ah... Well, well, well. And what do you do now?Two samurai, eh? Frank and Portman eye each other.Are you working now?Good. 'cause I'm the only one in the room who needs protection. She gives Frank a look and leads Portman into the crowd.Thank God I had a bodyguard here. She grasps the railing and looks over.It's a long way down, Frank. You saved my life. Frank eyes the newly-welded anchor fixture. It has held. Rachel takes Portman by the arm. The front of her dress is stained with champagne.Maybe someone will keep an eye on me while I change. She leads Portman past Frank and up the stairs toward her bedroom. Frank and Portman lock eyes. Portman shrugs; he feels badly for Frank.I'm not doing this.I said I was grateful. Thank you and good night. She looks to the door that leads back to the party. The SOUNDS of CELEBRATION CONTINUE outside. She starts to cross to the door.Please go now. Portman moves toward her as she opens the door, reaching for her arm. Then he sees, through the doorway, Tony standing in the hall talking to a woman. Tony looks up at the sound of the door and sees them both. Rachel slips quickly out of Portman's grip.Mr. Portman was just leaving us, Tony. Portman hesitates, then smiles at Rachel and Tony and, with a quick peck on Rachel's cheek, slips past them back to the party. Rachel briefly scans the party crowd over Tony's shoulder but she doesn't see Frank. The door closes, leaving her alone in the room again. She reaches for a bottle of Scotch and raises it to her mouth, drinking straight from the bottle.What the hell are you looking at? You probably never had a heavy night in your whole, goddamn disciplined life. Frank looks at her, continues to eat.You know, Farmer, you're a self- righteous son-of-a-bitch. Frank has to smile at this, which makes Rachel even angrier.Don't laugh at me, goddamit! And don't you dare judge me.Hello, Devaney.Tony and I went over to Bal Harbour. Did a little shopping. Tony comes back, a smile playing across his lips. Frank watches near the entrance.Farmer, you work here! Do you understand that? You work for me.Did Fletcher call? Devaney, staring after Frank, shakes his head \"no.\"Fletcher? No response.Baby, is that you? It's mommy, honey.Farmer... Nothing that's happened between us matters... I understand now... You're going to have to believe me, because I'm not going to beg.It wasn't what he said... it was the way he said it... he was so... Her voice cracks. She stops and tries to compose herself.I need you... I'm afraid... and I hate it. I hate my fear... Please protect me... Protect Fletcher... If anything happened to him... Frank looks at her. Tears are destroying her elaborate stage makeup. She wipes them away with her hand.I'll do whatever you say. This is the first time Frank has ever heard Rachel say that. He studies her, then looks out at the ocean.That's going to protect us?Terrific.Fletcher doesn't swim well.That's right.It's so quiet here.How long has this game been going on? Frank picks up a knight, thinks, sets it back down.Well, that's it for me, I'm going to bed. She rises. Frank follows her up the stairs. Nicki watches them go.Good night, Frank. Rachel turns, goes to her room and closes the door.No! He can't swim!Fletcher, baby. Are you all right? Baby. Fletcher, spluttering, is handed up to Rachel by Frank. Rachel hugs Fletcher to her. Herb bends down to check he's breathing properly, wrapping the boy in his jacket.What are you doing? You out of your mind? You're crazy! You're all right, baby. You could have drowned him! Frank and Henry look out toward the boat which has come to a stop out in the middle of the lake.What's happening? The terrier suddenly starts barking loudly.Frank?What's happening? Where's Nicki?You, you, you... You brought this pain into my house... Now you're here! Where were you then? Why didn't you save her? It was your job to protect me and she died doing it... It was me they were after. And you let them kill her! She never did anything to anyone. As she loses the strength and the will to hit him, her blows become sloppy, weak. She sinks to the steps, sitting on them, sobbing.She never hurt anyone. She was good. You saw her. She never wished anyone any harm. Did she? Did she? Frank looks at her, shakes his head \"no.\" Rachel puts her head in her hands and is silent for a few moments; her crying slows.She never hurt a soul. ... I didn't love her well enough. I didn't take care of her... ... She gave me only love.I guess you've heard what's happening. Frank nods.Mind if I sit down? Frank shakes his head. They sit side by side for awhile, both lost in thought. Rachel seems very calm.It isn't over yet, is it? Frank shakes his head.So he'll come again?The Oscars?When I was back in Squirrel Hill, I started betting my friends fifty bucks each that someday I'd win an Oscar. You can understand how important it is that they see me up there if I win. She looks at him and smiles.If everyone of those pikers comes through, it could add up to a lot of money.I know. But I can't stay up here on my hill forever. They are silent for awhile. Rachel lies back on the grass, stares at the sky.I didn't get to this place in my life by doing the smart thing every time. How 'bout you, Frank Farmer? Out there on the edge... did you ever do something that didn't make too much sense, except maybe inside you? In your stomach somewhere? Something that wasn't smart? I'll bet you have plenty. I'll bet you do. Nobody gets really good without it. And you're good. I know that. She sits up beside him.I don't know why all this has happened to me... ... but I do know that none of it's your fault. I hope you can hear me, because this is how I say I'm sorry. Frank accepts.So... I'm going to go see if I win an Oscar. And I won't worry about it at all. Because I've got you to protect me. Frank almost smiles.I wish you boys would relax a little. Nothing bad's gonna happen out there, alright? Unless I lose the fucking award. She looks around at the men, all are tense.Jesus, what a crew. Rachel leans forward and flips down the mirror on the panel in front of her and checks her appearance. The limo moves up.Screw it. I'm through worrying. When your number's up, it's up. Right, Farmer? The limo is almost at the red carpet. Frank slips out the front door of the moving limo.Sure, Skip. Skip takes a typewritten sheet from a sheaf in his hand and gives it to Rachel. He consults a clipboard as he speaks. There, laid out minute by minute, is the order of the evening's events. Each one has a precise time printed beside it, including those that involve Rachel.That's right, Clive. And I don't like it one bit that you look skinnier than me.I want that broad run out of town.What's wrong? Skip Thomas appears at her side.Yes! I want him. Skip shrugs. Clive takes Rachel's arm.-- let's find out who the winner is.Christ, what an idiot I am. Jesus. What the hell's the matter with me? Frank moves up closer, and exchanges looks with Tony, who is confused by Rachel's behavior. Rachel turns toward Frank and, in so doing, brings the man comforting her around to face Frank. It is Reardon.Farmer, you've made me a raving lunatic. Frank barely hears Rachel, so struck is he by Reardon's presence. Frank looks around them quickly for Portman. Rachel looks at Frank with irritation and turns back toward the Green Room. A production aide signals Reardon.Thank you for your help, John. I'm fine. Rachel walks off toward the Green Room with Tony. Reardon starts to walk out toward the stage. Frank stops him. Reardon is irritated.Skip, I'm moving as fast as I can. For chrissake, go twitch somewhere else.Bullshit, you saw me. Farmer's made me a raving lunatic --Shut up... This is the last straw. She throws down the powder and stands up fast, makeup and purse flying. The powder com- pact bursts over the cross lying on the table. Everyone in the Green Room looks at her.Shut up, you maniac! You never stop. Now you've made an ass of me in front of a billion people. And you won't quit. They stare at each other and everyone else stares at them.No!He's my bodyguard. Get off him! He's O.K... FRANK'S POV - SERIES OF SHOTS A SERIES of SWIFT LOW ANGLE SHOTS through legs and faces. One brief glimpse that could be Portman. A cameraman turns. It's not. Frank is desperate, pushing away a helping arm. The chaos mounts. SIRENS WAIL outside.You shouldn't be here. Frank laughs. There is a pause.So, you're quitting show business?Too bad. You had talent. What are you going to do?Get him when Fletcher's not around.He's got white hair, Frank.Why'd you have to get me an old man?Yeah... well, give me a kiss and let's get this over with.Wait...Remember when you said you'd risk your life for me? Frank tries to break in, but she won't let him interrupt.I didn't really believe it then. Nobody means what they say. But you did, Frank. You did it. You laid it all on the line for me. Frank tries to speak, she puts her hands to his lips.Don't wreck this for me. I don't want to hear any bullshit about you just doing your job. You did more than save my life, Frank. You showed me a way to be. And I love you for it. There, I said it. I'll never forget what it felt like to be under your eye. Never.Here... I want you to keep this. If you ever need me, you just put this on and no matter where you are I will find you. I promise. She gives him a quick kiss and walks back toward the plane, her eyes holding Frank's. Frank opens his palm to reveal the little enamel cross.Thank you... Thank you... Now I want to sing you an old song, but it's a new favorite. As the music begins, Rachel stands alone in front of the band, mike in hand.You know, this song used to make me feel sad... But it doesn't anymore. Rachel pauses. The audience is still.Now it just reminds me of someone very special... This is for him. Rachel begins to sing the song 'WHAT BECOMES OF THE BROKEN HEARTED' - slow and sweet. It's the song she and Frank danced to.

verse trails"}, "NICKI": {"raw_line": "It was just great, Rory... But Rachel is already replying to the video director.Nice to meet you, Mr. Farmer.I think Bill's right, Rachel. It's time you took more precautions. Spector enters the conversation.You can look around if you like. Frank indicates it won't be necessary. Nicki stops working out.That's all right. It's an excuse to rest. It's my private place. I'm the only one who works out around here. Frank glances at photos on one wall. Most are of Nicki from years ago; some show her performing with a band.My own ego wall. No platinum records. Frank spots a picture of two girls.When I was a kid, I put a little band together. We played high school dances, stuff like that. Then Rachel joined the act. As you can imagine, she was quite a little entertainer. Even then, she had a way of stopping the show. So I kind of quit. Professionally, anyway.It was pretty obvious who the star in our family was. Frank looks back at the picture. Nicki smiles.He told Rachel no Sunday brunch at Charlie's.On the patio.Think of Fletcher --Rachel! Sandy Harris is on the phone! Rachel and Frank look up.Ta Da!Thought you'd like to know. Everyone said she was a sure thing. Of course, you know all about that. She raises an eyebrow, gives him a look. Frank looks steadily back at her. She drops a small pile of mail beside the magazines... several letters and a small packet. She's embarrassed by Frank's gaze.I'm sorry. That was out of line. It's none of my business... Here's today's question marks for you. She turns and walks briskly back to the house. Frank watches her go, then looks slowly down to the pile. From across the pool, Fletcher watches silently, then pushes his boat out into the deep water.You're very thorough. VARIOUS SHOTS - AROUND INTERIOR Frank makes a circuit through the rooms of the first floor, checking windows and doors. Nicki tags along.What's happening between you and Rachel? Frank glances at her.Come on. One minute she's got magnetic hands, the next she hates you. I can't figure out what it is now.It's a living.You think my life is pretty sickly, don't you?You must. I do. Frank steps into a tight, dark, little window alcove, checks the windows.Is it that easy? Frank turns from the window to find Nicki blocking his exit. She moves close to him and kisses him, her hands on his shoulders. The kiss ends and they look at each other.But you don't want me.I'm surprised. Thorough fellow like you. Why stop at one sister when you can fuck them both?But you didn't say no to the boss. She starts to turn away from him, but his hands are on her now, holding her close, refusing to let her turn away. Their faces are very close. It is tight and near here.I don't need this from you.It's not so simple.Let me go. He releases her, looks at her.I was an idiot last night. There is a long pause.What do you think about today?You're right. He does.He almost got Fletcher today......my darling Fletcher...He doesn't even know who hired him. He doesn't know who I am and I don't know who he is....I went to a bar in East L.A. I asked around... I talked to a man......Armando... He arranged it. That's all I know...... and then some... Till it's done.I'm not sure... I was very stoned.No, no. You don't understand. The letters came first. I don't know who's sending them... but they're reading my mind... Those were my thoughts. I hate her. It made me think I could do it... But I could never hurt Fletcher. Never. You've got to stop it!Don't you even want to know why?What if we can't -- Frank motions her into silence. We strain to hear what Frank hears. Silently, Frank goes to the door, crouch ing. He listens. There again is a DISTANT GROWL from the DOG upstairs. Frank lifts his gun from the table, turns to Nicki.No, no... stop... I'm the one who...", "clean_line": "great rory rachel replying video director nice meet mr farmer think right rachel time took precautions spector enters conversation look like frank indicates won necessary nicki stops working right excuse rest private place works frank glances photos wall nicki years ago performing band ego wall platinum records frank spots picture girls kid little band played high school dances stuff like rachel joined act imagine little entertainer way stopping kind quit professionally pretty obvious star family frank looks picture nicki smiles told rachel sunday brunch charlie patio think fletcher rachel sandy harris phone rachel frank look ta da thought like know said sure thing course know raises eyebrow gives look frank looks steadily drops small pile mail magazines letters small packet embarrassed frank gaze sorry line business today question marks turns walks briskly house frank watches looks slowly pile pool fletcher watches silently pushes boat deep water thorough shots interior frank makes circuit rooms floor checking windows doors nicki tags happening rachel frank glances come minute got magnetic hands hates figure living think life pretty sickly frank steps tight dark little window alcove checks windows easy frank turns window nicki blocking exit moves close kisses hands shoulders kiss ends look want surprised thorough fellow like stop sister fuck boss starts turn away hands holding close refusing let turn away faces close tight near need simple let releases looks idiot night long pause think today right got fletcher today darling fletcher know hired know know went bar east asked talked man armando arranged know till sure stoned understand letters came know sending reading mind thoughts hate think hurt fletcher ve got stop want know frank motions silence strain hear frank hears silently frank goes door crouch ing listens distant growl dog upstairs frank lifts gun table turns nicki stop"}, "SPECTOR": {"raw_line": "Yes, I'll hold but not long...Nicki, I'm sure Mr. Farmer would tell you the number of nuts writing fan letters jumps every time Rachel is on the cover of a magazine....And I'm sure you'll blend in just fine. You can select whatever alarm systems you want for the house. Some kind of improved security for the gate. What else, Rachel? Rachel stands and starts to wander over to Rory and the dancers. Frank looks at Devaney. Devaney doesn't like the tone this is taking.I was just going to cover that. We'll have to tell the child you have some other function...Bill, I don't think we should be begging this guy for his services.Devaney says you were in the Secret Service. Frank nods.Ever guard the main man?Reagan got shot. His chatter is beginning to annoy Frank.That's good. Frank goes back to his letters. He taps the stack in the center of the table.We said there'd been some electrical problem while she was on stage. Short circuit. Look, she doesn't need that kind of worry right now. It would upset her.There was no reason for the police. No one got hurt.It was nothing. It was just our people there. Frank turns and watches Fletcher by the pool. Devaney's eyes are still on Frank's face.Yes.'Superstars in their Boudoirs.'She didn't have to like it... Devaney gently lays the cut-out letter on the bed.Are you kidding? This would really freak her out.Of fuck, we don't need this now...Excuse me?No. I'll talk to her. Spector exits the room in a huff.Why are we stopping? Are we here? Behind them, THROUGH the rear window, the 4 X 4 can be seen. Sensing something, it makes a sudden TIRE- SCREECHING left turn, disappearing behind them.Do you know who couldn't get past the gates yesterday?Robin Leach, that's who. Rory sniggers into the back of Rachel's hair, fighting off a laugh. Rachel has difficulty keeping a straight face, too. Spector glares at them as Frank enters from the sliding door.You think that's funny? The man talks to 20 million people and he can't even get in here.Oh Jesus, Bill.That's right. Devaney looks at Frank imploringly.Tuesday -- morning -- brunch. Where did you find this guy? Rachel turns ON the BLENDER and stares at Frank.The Mayan, Frank.It's a club, Frank. Come on, Henry, let's go.I just did. He disappears inside the limo. Rachel tugs at Frank's lapels, looks him up and down, brushing something off his shoulder. Frank's annoyed.Okay, she knows how it works, let's get going. Rachel manages a quick smile to Frank as she gets in the back. Frank gets in the front beside Tony. The limo pulls out.It wasn't me. The car turns a corner and there it is, The Mayan only fifty yards ahead, a mob of fans spilling out of the club, off the sidewalk and into the street.I swear I thought she'd talk to you. Maybe later. What can I say. Frank is checked out by a strange-looking women in Vampyra Drag.We didn't want to worry you...Okay. Let's not get hysterical...It was weeks ago. You were out of town...Listen, Fletcher is okay. The house is like Fort Knox now. Right, Frank?There's no way anyone could...No, wait... look everybody calm down. Calm down.Let's just see how she is. How do you feel, honey? Someone comes through the door with some flowers. Frank eases them out and gently closes the door.We don't know that. Frank, we don't know that. Rachel is enraged.Fine, you make it, they'll tear the fucking place apart.Are we having a communications problem here?Apparently, I didn't make it clear to you how things go around here.I didn't think she could handle it.Look. Frank, I know what you're saying. I know you want to do what's best for her. I understand that. You have a job to do here. But you have to understand that Rachel has a job to do too. And that's what she's doing - out there. She's working, Frank. That's what she does and that's where she does it. She's hot right now. This is the time for her. If she doesn't get out there, she's dead. Forget about crazy death threats, if she doesn't sing, she's dead anyway... Look, handled properly, this thing could be good for a million dollars' worth of free publicity. Frank grabs him by the collar and slams him up against a wall of curtain ropes.It could clinch her the nomination.Trouble with you is you don't understand the sympathy vote.Look at her, fucking great.Hey! What the fuck... Farmer! Farmer! Come back here... The limo skids around the corner and speeds off up the street, leaving Spector in helpless fury -- apoplectic and speechless.Farmer! Get in here!Put together a list of your expenses. Your total billing... Let me have it in one hour and I'll see that a check is cut.What's on my mind is that you're fired, Frank. She missed all her interviews yesterday because of your little date. Do you realize she stood up Barbara Walters? First you fuck up her career... Behind Spector, out of his line of sight, Rachel and Devaney appear in the doorway with more cards. They also stop and listen.... and now you're fucking with her head.You think so? You forget who signs your check. You don't understand the role I play around here.Get your shit together and be out of here by noon.She's signed the fucking contract, Bill. You want me to read it to you? Rachel is watching them both.Oh. 'Fuck the contract.' Great. Why don't you let Rachel speak for herself? I think she has some say in this.Well, I guess this is democracy in action.I gave in. That's not easy for me. Don't I get a hug?Yeah?... Sure, put him on... Ben how are you?... uh huh......The Ambassador? What the hell are you trying to pull, Ben? Rachel always gets the Presidential... I don't care what you thought... Devaney leans to Frank as Spector's conversation continues in the b.g.... I'm aware of that, Ben, but let me just remind you people that you invited us... Frank turns toward the door.O.K. Rachel. It's showtime! They're rolling. Let's go.Yes. It is.Great, babe. They got what they needed. Let's get back inside. Frank increases his pace to keep by Rachel's side, gently easing a path for her. Schiller scurries behind in Frank's wake. Rachel turns suddenly as a tall good-looking lifeguard appears in the throng. She eyes him appreciatively.Kick me, beat me... whatever makes you feel good. But let's not pretend you don't like it. We're too close for that. Whipping people into a frenzy is why you got into it in the first place. Rachel's eyes lock with Spector's -- there's a real connec- tion and understanding here that she spends a lot of time denying. Frank sees it as clearly as Spector, whose tone becomes almost soothing --And it's nothing to be ashamed of, either, not for a second. It's a gift... and only a handful are given it. Many call but few are answered.Don't fool with the blessing, Rachel. The magic is sustained through its use.I'm done. Not another word... ... I know you like to be reminded sometimes. Rachel looks away. It's true. He's good at his job.Honey, everything's fine. No one noticed anything. Everybody in this building is ready to jump out of their skin from nerves.You're making her crazy. You're making us all crazy.After tonight, you're back in charge.He knows nothing about show business.

They all in trouble?Katherine had this place organized just the way she wanted it. Frank's momma. There's the COUGH and SPUTTER of an outboard MOTOR from outside. Rachel looks from the kitchen window and sees Fletcher and Frank in the small skiff by the dock. Fletcher tugs again on the starter cord. At the third tug he tumbles backwards onto the seat.I guess he'd better stay in the boat then. Frank tells me you're a singer.I'm afraid we're a little out of touch here. I'm sorry. Rachel waves this off.You must be very successful to need Frank. Rachel smiles and looks out of the window.Frank came back and stayed six months after the Reagan thing. Rachel's questioning look encourages Herb.Frank wasn't there the day he was shot. He never got over that. We buried Katherine that day. Rachel looks out again at Frank and Fletcher in the boat.... And I never hit him. Ever. To this day. That's true, isn't it? That's very unusual for my people. So what happens? When he's ten years old, he complains about it? Can you believe that?I don't care. I'm proud of that. Anyway, he's ten years old and he's just started playing tackle football. He comes to me and tells me he's afraid of getting hit, right? And he thinks it's because I never hit him. 'Why don't you ever hit me?' he says to me!He got over it: Turned into a helluva wide receiver. He couldn't stand being afraid. When he found something that scared him, he'd just do it 'til the fear went away.His mother was the same way. Rachel smiles at him, thinking, then looks through at Frank in the kitchen, still peering out of the windows. Nicki watches Rachel.Come on, son, you can run but you can't hide. Herb pulls up a chair and smiles as Frank appears from the kitchen, a bowl of popcorn in his hand. Frank takes a place across from his dad by the fire. The others gather round.Your move. Frank studies the board. Rachel lowers her head into a cupped hand, fascinated.He had me on the run there that first year. Frank picks up his rook, scratches his forehead with it. He turns to Fletcher.Come over here, Fletcher, sit by me. Fletcher goes over and joins him.I've never heard church music in the middle of the week before.He's all right. Henry helps Frank up out of the water. Frank sits on the end of the dock, breathing hard.It's okay, Henry. Herb puts his hand on Fletcher's head.You all right now, son?Frank! Henry turns and motions to Herb to stay away.Someone's cut the phone lines. It could be anywhere between here and town.Maybe it has to do with you. Frank looks at him.We can't walk out of here at night with them. Frank shakes his head.It's me!
