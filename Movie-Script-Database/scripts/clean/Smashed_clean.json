You sing like an angel -- a drunk angel.I'd say that, uh...my wife is the sexiest, most amazing woman alive.Yeah?Sure she just didn't want to get into your pants?Yeah?Eh, well...what're you gonna do, huh? Wanna drive us home?I don't want to watch my brother not score. I want to go to bed with you and... ...you know.Writing is a job! Not having to report to an office only makes work harder. Baby, you drank a lot. I think Owen should take us home -- you're too drunk to drive.Tell that to the cops.That sounds like two missions.It kinda sounded like two, right?Huh?!What happened? I came home and you were gone and I waited and waited.I was worried. I kept calling you.You smell funny. What do you smell like?So, why didn't you come back or call me?Well, maybe I'm not. I worry, baby. I love you -- and you know how you get sometimes.I can't be worried about you all the time.I'm up now -- how `bout I make us bacon and egg sandwiches?Magic words.Check for your mom's on the table.Because I make it with love -- and bacon.Me too. I spent like three hours at the post office trying to buy stamps and stuff.Oh, baby, that's --Oh. `Cause it would be great news -- if it was true. `Course then I'd have to drink your beer...Ooh...What do you mean?Oh. That. Yeah...you kinda do.Baby -- that's not true. You're beautiful. And brilliant. And I love you. I wouldn't be married to a \"mess.\"Well, those things happen sometimes. I mean, they shouldn't happen all the time, but...it's the price of, uh, truly living life.No. And it's true -- you and me, we're not just some boring couple in the suburbs who don't sleep with each other and have nothing to talk about except whatever TV show they're currently into. We, like...still know how to party.I'll help you.Yeah? Like a therapist?We just like to have a good time.I promise.Of course.WHAT?!Uh...how's that even happen? You give someone a ride and she rewards you with crack?!Where?What?Oh, my god...you smoked crack with some random stranger? Did you...share a pipe?Ughhh... Just playing Devil's advocate, but maybe it's the crack-smoking you need help with and not the drinking.I'm just saying.We'll chill out with the booze for a while. We can just be wine-with- * dinner people. How's that sound?Maybe you should go to, uh... one of those meetings. They have `em over there.Remember when I was shit-faced and took that Q & A pamphlet from there?Yeah... ...that was fun, wasn't it?Hey ---- look out for that crack!Oh, sorry -- I thought there was a crack there... ...but you must have smoked it last night.\"Have you missed days of work or school because of drinking?\"\"Do you envy people who can drink without getting into trouble?\"\"Do you have `blackouts'?\"\"Has your drinking caused trouble at home?\"Yeah. Definitely. But we still had a lot of \"yes\" answers. Yep...we still qualify as drunks.Yeah, right.Eight.Uh-huh...You've been boozing.Yeah, right. You can't go to AA wasted. It's like a rule or something.Was it a bunch of old biker guys?Yuck -- I hate enthusiasm. I'm sorry it wasn't cool.I can't really imagine never drinking. I guess I don't have to, though -- -- you're the one with the problem.Hey -- I love you. I don't want you to have to drink.Good -- `cause you're my favorite person to drink with in the whole damn world.Oh, no you didn't!Are you trying to have some sex?Come back to bed, baby.Well, you peed on me so I guess * we're even. *Well...I can't go to work like this.Yeah, but changing the sheets is my real job. Hey -- where were you last night?I woke up at like 4 a.m. and you were gone.Howdy.Eh -- alright. Couldn't find oatmeal so I made ketchup soup.What? It's tasty. So...I'm going to see that band * from Iceland with the triplets play * tonight. Want to come with me and Owen to check it out?C'mon -- Owen can't pick up girls without you.The Vice Principal?Wow, that's...uh, cool.Nothing -- I just...I didn't think you really loved the meeting you went to yesterday. In fact, it sounded like you hated it. So I'm kinda surprised you're going back.I'm here for you, okay? Even though I drink -- I could slow down if you need me to. I'm sure I could.Yep -- I'm just pacing myself. The tortoise wins the race.Sorry if I was doing a bad job -- I'm kinda hammered.Huh? *Did I do something?We used to talk, but now you come home and go to meetings and by the time you get back I'm --I was gonna say \"tired.\"Really? To see your mom?Why?With your mom? Kinda. Is this the \"amends\" step?Well then why're you going?I don't know...I mean, do you do everything your sponsor tells you to do?I dunno...it's been a long damn time since you've seen your mom. And you didn't listen when I suggested we visit her.Well, can I come with you? It'll be like a little vacation.Come on, if you do that you'll just get depressed. If I go we can try to make it fun. Go hiking and stuff.I think I can handle not drinking for like a day.Ah...the lawn-gnomes. I missed those guys.Hi, Holger!So...we gonna go in?You're fine.Wine?Hi, Ms. Foster.Huh-huh...90 days.Hey -- I'm not drinking either...today.Of course.She just can't handle her liquor.Did you ever hook up with guys when you worked here?You know -- sneak off with a co- worker and do it against a pine tree or something?I mean, if I were a teenage boy working with a stone cold fox like you I'd totally want to hook up with you here. Like...in the ginger bread house.You were probably the coolest girl in town -- and the prettiest. I'm sure everyone was in love with you.Listen -- I'm sorry. He's drunk...really drunk.I'm...sorry. I...was drunk too when I told him.You wanna come?I'm sure they have near-beer, baby. It'll be fun.That sounds like a lot of fun.I love you.I love you...?Well......I gotta say -- this is the boringest meal I've had in about as long as I can remember.Who're you texting?She's like a parole officer.I'm glad to know every little fuck- up I have is gonna become a topic of conversation with some chick I don't even know.I finished some writing and met up with Owen to watch the game and toss a few back. Dear. You do anything special?Yeah, it is. Telling kids fucked-up stuff is totally funny...in, you know -- a kinda fucked-up way.God, Kate -- come on. What else were you supposed to do?It's not that big a deal. Jesus. Is this what those meetings teach you? To make drama out of nothing?Why don't you go and tell the Principal that you were never pregnant? That the reason you puked is because you smoked crack all night? Would you feel better about yourself then?Fine. Do it, then. I guess you don't need a job.I never do anything responsible? What about buying this house that we live in? Or the food that we're eating?Oh, I'm sorry that I have a family that supports us -- and not the other way around.Nothing, Kate. But you can't be mad at me because my family has helped us out. You should be grateful we don't have to struggle.What the fuck are you talking about?You know what?I fucking hate AA! It turned you into a bitch. A brain-washed bitch.Yeah, you don't drink booze for three months and suddenly you're some saint? You have it all together and I'm just a baby?I'm trying, Kate. I'm trying to understand you. But it's hard. You're different and maybe it's good that you're different. Maybe I'm bad and bad for you or something -- because I didn't think the person you were before was so awful. I loved that person. Yeah, she drank a lot and she did some silly things...but she was my Kate.Yeah, of course. But it's different. You're different.Kinda, yeah.Babe -- you gotta hear this with the speakers hooked up. It's insane.Whoa...what happened to you?Oh, no...Uh...we have soda. I can make coffee.So...I guess you aren't doing the AA thing anymore?What's going on?I don't know what the right thing to do here is.Baby, I didn't mean that. I was just being a jerk.I don't know. Having a beer or something is one thing, but...I think you really may have a problem.I'm sorry. I didn't realize --What are you talking about?! Of course I care about you. I love you.Look -- I think you should get to sleep. You're really wasted.Please, will you stop?Really. This is weird.No! Jesus -- what the fuck is wrong with you?Kate, you need to --You're blaming other people for your problems.Stop it! You're acting like a freak!No! What's wrong with you?I write about music.Yeah...I do freelance for a lot of magazines. But print really is dead. So now most of my stuff winds up on websites. Which is depressing. `Cause you can't hold it -- you can just look at it. It's like...Huh?It was crazy. I...I'm sorry -- I'm sure you're a great lady. You have lovely hands and hair but......I'm gonna go to the...I'm just gonna go.So, I got into a little trouble -- drunk in public. On a bicycle. Um, I was thinking...maybe I need to go to one of those meetings. I'd like to go with you, though. If that's cool. Let me know if we could discuss it sometime, okay? Maybe you could come over to our -- um, my house? Uh...yeah. Thanks.\"Let me know if we could discuss it sometime?\" Such an idiot...Miss our house?Miss me?Really?They gave you that?Oh...wow. Congratulations. That's really...really...just great. I mean it. Tuesday is the night I got pulled over. Parallel lives, huh?So -- you dating anyone?Are you?Me either. Owen keeps trying to get me to be his \"wing-man\" and it's ridiculous and these girls in bars are so lame and I just keep thinking how I wish I was meeting you in a bar for the first time and I didn't come with any baggage and I could buy you a drink and flirt with you all night and ask for your number. Wanna go out sometime?I fucked up, didn't I?Yeah, I did. I know I did. I had a beautiful woman who used to love me and now when I see her she doesn't even want to look me in the eyes.I miss you. I miss the way you taste and smell and...I miss things about you that used to drive me nuts! I miss you liking shitty 80's music and fake punk-rock from the 90's......and all I want to do is touch you one more time to just, remember -- to make sure it was real.Or...maybe I'm a just a delusional fucking idiot.Yeah?I dunno -- like...I'm not sure. I think, um...Sure, yeah -- or I could make a bacon and egg sandwich...Jesus. It starts with alcohol. Then meat. Have you given up fun, too?Sorry. Bad joke.Okay...Sorry.You sure?No...I'm good.Have you been playing a lot?Then how're you beating me?I haven't met anyone even vaguely interesting since we separated.I've been masturbating like crazy.I miss you.Okay. Fine.What?But I wasn't.What are trying to say?Yeah, I can understand that. I used to worry about you. But now I know you're okay. That makes me happy...I mean, it fucking sucks that you're better off without me but I'm glad you're doing well.Would you move back in if I came to meetings?But, would you?We can always turn the lights on.So, would you at least...let me take you out on a date?Maybe...?Okay...fine. 0 for 2. Last question: can we just...play one more game?C'mon...you keep kicking my ass. It's embarrassing. You've gotta give me a chance to redeem myself.

be such a shitty article -- nobody would read it.Aw...we need to find you a lady, Owen.She's hot! What can't you tell?You're being a little girl -- just go talk to her.I'll take point -- follow me.I want to buy a gimlet for me and a double-shot of whiskey for my brother-in-law `cause he's had a hard week.Wait -- don't you wanna know what happened to him?He just got back from England -- because he went there for a girl! A preppy, bitchy girl. Diane Court...that was her name. He loved her so much that he went with her because she had a fellowship or something. He gave up being a kickboxer. A kickboxer! * And she dumped him.And he teaches kids at the kickboxing studio. Oh, they're so cute!I think I got him laid.She seems totally game.I think I'm done for the night.No -- he needs to keep working it! * You guys stay here.I'll be home when you get there. We can \"you know\" then.So's Owen. I'm not that drunk. Besides, you know I focus when I drive -- it sobers me up.I love you, baby. I'll be waiting for you in a nice warm bed. You have exactly one mission: get your brother laid -- and don't talk to any other women.No, it's just one.GoodbyeIloveyouboth!You okay?Um...sure.Oh...I guess I could...I was gonna say \"call you a cab,\" `cause, you know -- I don't even know you.I wasn't --It's, uh...whiskey.I don't know. No.Okay, fine -- go ahead. Can you just roll down the window?WHOA!Not what I thought you meant.No, I...is that pot?Oh, shit! No...no thank you.I don't, um...I've never smoked crack.Uh...I think you should go.I don't know -- people might offer you crack?I said no.One puff. Then we are both going home.Fine....'cause I feel like I understand what it's like to be homeless, ya know? I mean, if you didn't know me, if we hadn't connected tonight, you might think: \"There's some upper-middle-class, NPR listening, self-congratulatory, insulated, lazy liberal bitch. Probably never had to worry about anything.\" But that's not true at all! I grew up poor, man. Single mother. McDonald's used to have one day a week where they sold 29 cent hamburgers, and another day where they had 39 cent cheeseburgers. My mom and me would go there and she'd get twenty burgers -- that was the limit, probably set up for folks just like us -- and then she'd put `em in the freezer and we'd microwave `em for dinner throughout the week.I was kinda overweight until high school, to be perfectly honest. Eating used to be my thing. When I started drinking, though, I kinda stopped eating so much. But anyway, the point is: You and me, we're not so different.Shhh...it's okay, baby. Go back to sleep.It's a long story.I ended up...I fell asleep in my car. Near the bar. I was too drunk to drive.Charlie -- -- I'm fine.I love you too. But I'm home. It's over. I gotta get to work.Don't worry so much. I'm fine. C'mon -- let me get you to bed.Thanks, baby.Why does the coffee taste so much better when you make it?Now, if I add a \"C,\" what word do I have?Yes, Hillary? *That's correct! Can. You've won an all-expenses paid trip to the blackboard, Hillary! *C'mon...there's a washer-dryer combo in it for you.Great job, Hillary -- let's give * her a round of applause!Can anyone use \"can\" in a sentence?Yes?Wonderful, Angela. You get a Camaro with flames painted on the hood.Now -- -- what's another word I could make by adding a letter to \"an\"?C'mon...Yes -- Ramon?P...okay, what word would that make if I added a \"P\"?Pan! That's right. Ramon Martinez...COME ON DOWN!Wow! Just look at that excellent penman --I'm so sorry you had to see that.What?Yes.Oh, that's really good to know. I'll have to thank him. I just feel awful for getting sick in front of my students.Um...it's the first trimester.Uh-huh.Okay.Huh?Well...it's hard to explain.I wouldn't call it a burden, but --Yeah. Exactly.Um, I don't...okay -- but it sleeps a lot.Like...a lot.Thank you.Yeah, well...I'm really embarrassed -- but I feel a lot better. And I just wanted to say thank you.Oh, no, I...I know that! Oh, God, I... ...listen -- I'm not actually pregnant.I'm just really hung over. The kids started asking me questions after I vomited and I panicked.I know. I...please don't say anything.I had such a crappy morning.I told my class I was pregnant.I'm not. Pregnant. So don't worry.Well, it was a lie. I just lied to my class. After barfing in front of them.Yeah, that's what they said. Listen...I can't do this anymore.I dunno. I think I might...drink too much.I know I do -- I'm a fucking mess...I left work after puking in front * of little kids. And...now I'm * drinking in the middle of the day. *Isn't that like a slogan for some kind of beer or toothpaste or something...?Yeah... ...I think I need to slow down. And I might need help.I know, but...I might need more help.I don't know -- I just get stupid when I'm drunk, and I'm drunk a lot.Yeah, well... ...you've gotta promise not to tell this to anyone.That includes Owen.Well, last night I kinda, um... ...smoked some crack.After I left the bar, I, uh, picked up this drunk girl and...I don't really remember what came next, but I ended up smoking crack with her.Well...she seemed desperate. She really needed a ride home.Downtown. I think she maybe lives in...a tent?Well...she might be homeless. Or a prostitute. Or just some lost sorority girl. To be honest, I'm not sure...The drinking led to the crack- smoking. The drinking leads to everything stupid I do. I mean...can you even remember the last time we had sober sex?Yeah, right.Holy shit! And we answered \"yes\" to like every question and at the end it was like, \"If you answered `yes' to any of these you're an alcoholic!\"What crack?Absolutely.Envy isn't exactly the right word...Yeah, but who doesn't?No! We're great.I'm gonna go!No -- I'm serious! I'm gonna go. What time is it?See ya.This is me: going.So? You should come too!Oh, yeah? Watch me!Hi Donovan -- I'm Kate!A what?Okay. Do I just sit wherever?To this? Yeah. Why's everyone whispering?I guess.I'm Kate. I...I'm...I guess I'm a little drunk right now.Do you want me to talk about my childhood or something?I can -- I kinda hate my dad and don't talk to him. And my mom...oh, man...I don't even know where to start. She's, like, stuck in the 80's and kind of a metalhead. Her last boyfriend called himself a drummer but really just gave drum lessons to little kids and --I like drinking is the thing. I mean, I don't want to say you guys are wrong or anything...How old is that girl?! Can she even go to bars? How old are you, Amber?Everyday?AMEN!Okay...I think I'm good.So much for that.No, it was...I don't know. Enthusiastic people. A lot of really ENTHUSIASTIC PEOPLE!I don't have to drink. I just really like to drink. *What? You can't tell I'm 21? Come on -- I'm in here all the time. You know me.C'mon -- we can just pretend it's before two...It's just a little wine. I'm not driving or anything.Come on, dude -- I'll let you have a sip if you want.Why don't you give it to me, then? That wouldn't hurt anything. A gift -- because we're friends.You distract him, okay?!Water or coffee? Fuck you. What -- just cause I won't suck your dick?Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!This is bullshit! I have to pee.I didn't mean to! Sometimes I just have to pee really, really bad. *C'mon...can't we drink together?Charlie!Not again.I have to go to work. You snoozed my alarm again. I'm gonna be late.I have a weak bladder.You work from our kitchen.Huh?Where would I go at 4 a.m. alone? You must've been dreaming.I...I don't know yet.Not until summertime. You guys will be on vacation.Maybe...Woodrow Wilson?Thanks again for covering for me.There won't be another time.Okay... ...David?I don't know. Um...no?I puked in front of my class and then told everyone I'm pregnant. That's not really okay, huh?I went to AA last night.It was awful. I kept getting shushed.You?Maybe that would be good...I don't know.Thanks.Oh, well...she and I aren't that close.Okay. And...you're kinda the only person at school -- besides Mr. Davies -- who knows I'm pregnant. Could you...?Hey...How was your day? And what's that smell?Charlie! You need to eat.Oh, that sounds fun, but...I don't know...this guy I work with -- Mr. Davies --Yeah -- turns out he's sober and invited me to a meeting.What?Well...this is a smaller meeting. It might be different. I dunno -- I think I want to give it a fair shot.Besides -- I was hammered last night. Go on and have fun out drinking with Owen tonight. Seriously. I'm just gonna, you know, try something * different...Does everybody just...kinda, you know -- talk here?So since you're taking me here does that make you my sponsor?I can't believe I'm really here.I kinda like her.I feel like you're my wingman.Hey, I liked your speech.Kate. This is my first meeting. Or... first meeting where I'm not wasted.I don't really know how this stuff works.But...could I get your number? I mean, I may not need it, but...Okay. Yeah. You've been sober since you were 24?That seems really young.Okay, um...hello. I'm Kate and... ...I'm an alcoholic?Sorry. I don't mean to laugh -- it's just saying those words... ...I think I'm an alcoholic, but I don't really know. I drink -- a lot. I've always drank. Everyone I know drinks a lot. I never really thought I had a problem -- lately though it seems like maybe I do. I just want to be able to drink a beer without it turning into twenty -- or wetting my bed. It seems like every time I drink something awful happens. All the shit that I used to laugh off isn't really funny anymore. The dumb drunk stuff has gone from embarrassing to scary. I'm kinda...scared.I'm Kate. I'm an alcoholic.I kinda can't believe it's been ninety days. The longest I've gone since high school without drinking was, like, a week.It's weird -- in after-school specials the getting-sober part was only like a minute of the movie and suddenly...daddy's all okay.But it's so fucking hard and weird and suddenly I have all these other problems now that drinking isn't the problem.Everything else. Work, my non- existent relationship with my mom...A year, at least.Maybe. And then there's my marriage. I mean, Charlie's great. Really great, he's supportive, especially at first. It's strange, though. I feel like alcohol was the thing that connected us and now that I don't drink we lead these two very different lives. We haven't slept together in forever... I haven't pissed myself in awhile, though. So that's good.I could stick around and help you...I didn't know you were married.Why?Because you're a dude we can't talk? I don't get that \"men stick with men, women stick with women\" stuff.Are you trying to tell me that you have a crush on me?Yeah, crush.It's okay. I think you're a really good guy.Oh, c'mon...WHAT THE FUCK?YES.Jesus -- you can't just go around telling people you want to fuck their \"moist pussy.\" Who even says that?I have to go inside my house -- where I live with my husband. Thanks for your creepy version of honesty.You okay?Actually, I'm not really in the mood.It's okay -- the 90 days was the gift.It's alright. Charlie... ...I miss you.I mean...I don't know. I don't really feel connected to you anymore.No. We don't talk that much.Kinda drunk.There's some stuff I need to do this weekend. I think I'm gonna go up to Lake Arrowhead.Do I need a reason?No.We send her checks. But we never actually see her. Sometimes it feels like I'm paying her to not be in my life. I thought it would be nice to visit her. And Jenny thinks it would be a good * idea.What?No. Do you think I'm brainwashed or something?Oh, baby -- I listen to you. This just...it felt like the right time. With all the changes I'm going through.Um...I think I should go alone.Well, if you go, don't take this the wrong way but -- I'd like it if maybe you didn't drink. Just while we're there.I should've brought something.Something, you know? Flowers, or...No. Definitely not that.Go on...Oh, God...I left you a message, mom.Just water for me.That's pretty wild, mom.I told you I just wanted water.That's actually why I wanted to come up, mom. I stopped drinking.I'm not pregnant, mom.I just needed a break. I'm sober for the first time in years.It's been a while, actually.Drink if you want to, Charlie. Charlie didn't stop drinking. I'm doing it by myself. And...I started going to 12-step meetings.I thought you'd be happy for me, mom.It's okay, mom. I know you can't help it.This place shut down a decade ago and then there was a fire and now it's basically abandoned.We came here every year the week before Christmas.And then I worked here in high school -- selling hot chocolate. And they had real reindeer, too. They kept `em over there.My mom worked here when she was younger. I think everyone who grew * up around here worked at Santa's Village at some point.This is what I think of when I think of Christmas. Thanks for coming up here with me.I'm sorry my mom's so awful.Huh?Um...no.Oh...you shouldn't have.Wow...Oh, it's so...nice.Uh-huh...What?What you said to me was really fucked up.What were you even thinking?I get that. But you can't force your \"honesty\" on everyone you know.I'm flattered that you have...feelings for me. I am. But I'm married.No -- you don't have to do that. I didn't even tell him. But...you can't say that to a girl -- like, ever.Seriously. Consider that a rule of thumb. Someday, you're gonna meet a nice, available lady -- but if you say \"moist pussy\" to her, you will never, ever, ever get to see that part of her body!I'm not mad at him -- I'm mad at you! You said you wouldn't tell anyone about what I did.Great. Why don't you guys just go to the bar now?I'm hanging here.I'm staying in.Bye.Yeah... ...I love you too.Yes?What?Well...\"Shouldn't you be fatter?\" is the correct way to ask that question.Now, one day when you're very old and wise fourth graders, you'll learn about multiplication and --Well, I......I'm not going to have a baby.See -- I was pregnant but, it wasn't my time, I suppose...WHAT? No -- of course not!No! I didn't kill my baby! Okay, listen kids -- we shouldn't be talking about this. But... ...sometimes women get pregnant and then early on -- before it's even a baby -- they stop being pregnant.No -- not because a doctor murdered it. It's called a miscarriage. That means it wasn't my plan -- it's just what happened. Does anyone want to ask me any questions?Let's get back to subtraction -- or addition. Or both.Does it matter that I lied? That I was never pregnant?And the bad news?That's all, huh?Jenny. *She's my sponsor.So...what'd you do today, honey?I lied to my class again. I told them that I had a miscarriage.That's not funny.Great, well -- I'm glad I'm not actually having a baby.Well, I feel like a piece of shit for lying.It's not nothing. I lied to little kids and to my boss because I can't take responsibility for my actions.I've been thinking about doing that, actually. Yeah. I think I would feel better about myself.I could be like you -- I could stay home drinking all day and never do anything responsible.Having rich parents doesn't make you responsible. I think it's pretty much done the opposite.What the fuck is that supposed to mean?I wouldn't care if we struggled with money. I've struggled with money my whole life. I'd rather worry about where my next meal is coming from than if I - - in some drunken stupor -- married a man who just wants to party and meet bands.I'm talking about you being a baby. A selfish baby.What?At least I'm not drunk all the time.You loved that person? Do you not love me now?Before I was a mess. I'm finally getting my life together -- and you loved me more before?I feel so fucking weird right now -- Charlie doesn't love me like he used to and I've lied to my students multiple times.I just don't feel...normal right now.Everything in life isn't connected to being an alcoholic.\"Steps\"...I have the crying part covered.I don't know what I'm gonna do about anything.You sure that's okay?I'm...I'm really sorry.I freaked out -- a student asked why I wasn't fat and I just froze up and then another student was saying I killed my baby and I didn't know what to do.It won't. I promise that.Okay, I......I can't keep doing this. I feel awful.No. You don't understand. I have to be honest with you.Principal Barnes...I wasn't ever pregnant.I lied -- to the class and to you -- because I was scared.I know. And when that happened I didn't know what to do because the truth is --No, well, yes. I have a disease, but, um... ...it's alcoholism.I've been working on it. I'm one- hundred days sober. When that happened I'd been out drinking and was hung over and --Yes.Well, a student asked if I was pregnant -- and \"yes\" just kind of fell out of my mouth.I know.I was sick.I'm sorry.I'm really sorry. I am. I've been wanting to tell you the truth because honesty has become really important to me. I'm in AA now and doing the steps and working with a sponsor and everything. It's really hard. I mean, I think my husband might hate me, and --I know.Am I being fired?Listen -- I'm really sorry, but I'm doing the right things now.Principal Barnes --Thank you.I told Principal Barnes about everything.Huh? Oh, God -- no. I told her that I'm an alcoholic. And that I lied. And she fired me.I've been going to AA and trying to be sober and this is what it got me. Fired, for telling the truth.I'm a fuck-up. I'll always be a fuck up. I'm just like my mom.I gotta go.Whiskey. Double.Can I have another one?Why?What about him?You're not kicking him out.Stop it -- you aren't my pal. I just got fired, and I just quit AA. It didn't work.You know what? I was fine -- had a husband that loved me and maybe I sometimes did embarrassing stuff, but it was a phase.I go to AA and sober my husband and I start fighting and stop fucking -- and sober I get fired! Isn't that what's supposed to not happen?NO! I don't want a cab. I want -- -- drugs. Can you hook me up?C'mon...let's go out back and smoke some crack.You think I'm above smoking crack? `Cause I'm not. And are you really gonna tell me you're not a little attracted to me...?Just a teensy bit...?Well...you might want to consider investing in glasses, buddy. `Cause I'm a...a stone cold fox. And I'm smart. And I'm......a good person.NO! I'm not. I've got friends. They'll pick me up.I'll call Mr. Davies. He has dreams about me.Can't believe my luck. I just want to get drunk and a bartender won't let me. Life is stupid.You hear me? Life is FUCKING STUPID!Davey-wavey...I called you. Why'd you bring her?Parole officer.How `bout we drive to Mexico and party our asses off? My treat.Sounds fucking stupendous, right?Fuck off.I'm drunk. I'm fired from my job.We got any drinks?Don't be cute with me. You know what I mean.What gave that away?Come on, baby -- let's do some shots.I'm celebrating. What the fuck does it look like?Are you gonna be a little girl or are you gonna drink with me?Okay, so let me see if this makes sense: you say you miss the old Kate -- the Kate who drinks and blacks out and has fun. Well...here she is.Fuck yeah you were. And what? Now you won't drink with me?Well thanks for all the support when I was trying to be sober!Of course you didn't realize! You don't fucking care about me.I love you too. Love is the easy part. It's the rest of the shit that's hard.Take off your pants.I don't wanna sleep. I wanna fuck.No! I want you to fuck me!Be a man and fuck your wife!With me? With me?! What the fuck is wrong with me? I try hard and I get shit on! Fucked up family, fired from my job -- this marriage. Nothing's wrong with me! What's wrong with YOU?!What? What? What do I need? I can't drink because I'm crazy or something and I can't stay sober because of you!I can't be sober and be with you.You tell me.Thanks.Hey, I'm Kate, alcoholic.I've heard that your best day drinking is worse than your worst day sober. Well...that is SO not true! I had amazing times drinking, dancing, and laughing...feeling like the most adorable, charming girl in the world. And I was adorable. I'd piss my pants, but I was still cute.When I first tried getting sober, I figured that as long as I didn't drink...everything else would just magically work out. But it didn't. My marriage fell apart. I got fired from my job. And that shit happened SOBER! I never read that in any pamphlet... ...that isn't what I signed up for. Um...so, I relapsed. Another shitty slogan I've heard in the rooms is that when you're sober for a bit and drink again \"the disease waits for you, picks up where it left off.\" I'm sorry you guys, but I HATE those slogans. They all sound like bumper stickers. But, I have to admit...for me, that last one is pretty damn true. When I drink...I become another person. And that person is a pretty big asshole. Well, unless you want to give me drugs or buy me drinks -- then that person is awesome.I wasn't happy being the \"good-time girl,\" though. And honestly, I wasn't very good at it.My life is really different than it was a year ago. I live alone. I'm bored a lot more. I have a job that pays a lot less. I'm thankful for the program -- for my friends in here who took the time to help me and give a shit about me.There are people that used to be a part of my life that I miss -- a lot -- but... ...I'm really grateful for this boring new life of mine.Um...yeah. Sometimes.Sometimes. I've been sober for a year.Yeah.Yeah. A couple of days ago. Tuesday.Charlie...No.I don't think it's a good idea.Charlie, please don't do this.I don't like shitty 80's music. I like good 80's music.You look really thin.When did you last eat?Should we order something?I don't know. I haven't really been doing the meat thing.Fine. Bacon and egg sandwiches. But I'm gonna make them.I don't care if you drink a beer.Yeah. Whatever.I haven't played in over a year.I don't know. Innate talent?Um...stick to the game, okay?Charlie --Stop it.You could've been killed.Riding your bike -- drunk.But is that really the point?I worry about you.You should go for yourself, not to make me happy.I'm not moving back in.Listen, I should go. It's gonna get dark soon.I don't know...", "clean_line": "bullshit writing performance blog shitty article read aw need lady owen hot tell little girl talk ll point follow want buy gimlet double shot
