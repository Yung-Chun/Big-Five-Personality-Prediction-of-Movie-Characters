{"Ringu": {"ASAKAWA": {"raw_line": "There seems to be a popular rumor going around about a \u0094cursed\u0094 videotape.Have you heard what kind of video it might be?Let\u0092s do it again.Have you heard what kind of video it might be?Watching TV late at night... do you know what station?Izu?And, do you know if anyone\u0092s really died from watching it?What is it?They were in a wreck?Do you know the name of the high school this girl went to?Hm?Thanks.But I wonder what this rumor\u0092s all about. Everyone you ask always mentions \u0093Izu.\u0094Gifu, but there was some big accident out there, and that ended up being what started the rumor.Mmm-hmm. Something terrible like that is going to stay in people\u0092s minds. Sometimes the story of what happened gets twisted around, and ends up coming back as a rumor like this one. That\u0092s what they say, at least.Maybe. Well, anyway, I\u0092m off. See you tomorrow.Okazaki, can I ask you a favor?Could you check out this article for me? Get me some more info.?Good. Call me as soon as you know more, OK?Yoichi!Sorry I\u0092m late. Oh, you\u0092ve already changed.Aargh, we\u0092ve gotta hurry!Did grandpa call?Well... it looks like she was really, really sick.Will you do me up?If it\u0092s something serious... well, yes.As hard as it is for us, what your auntie and uncle are going through right now is even harder, so let\u0092s not talk about this over there, OK?You and her used to play a lot together, didn\u0092t you?Dad.How is sis holding up?I\u0092ll go check on auntie and them, then.No, I...Well, they said there was no sign of foul play.What are you doing up here? You shouldn\u0092t just walk into other people\u0092s rooms.You go on downstairs, OK?You go on ahead.Hello?Thanks.Excuse me. This is, um, kind of a strange question, but by any chance were you friends of that young girl that died in the car as well?Please. If you know anything...Video?Tomoko-chan watched it, too? Where?Cause of death?Drugs?Mmm-hmm.Yeah...Izu...Look, I\u0092m probably going to be late coming home tonight, so just stick your dinner in the microwave when you\u0092re ready to eat, OK?Hmm?What did you say? You are not to speak of this at school, do you hear me?There\u0092s no way...\"My dad is fat. My mom is fat. That\u0092s why I\u0092m fat, too.\"Um, actually I\u0092m here on business.They would have stayed here on August 29th, all four of them. If there\u0092s any information you might have...That...That! What tape is that?One weekHis first year. What about you, Ryuji? How have you been recently?And money is...?That\u0092s right.Ryuji, four people have already died. On the same day!Take my picture.Hurry up and take it.There\u0092s the guest list from the cottage to look into... and the possibility of someone hacking into the local station\u0092s broadcast signals.Oh, thanks.Uh... sorry, I\u0092m working on something personal.What happened to you?I don\u0092t think any of the guests on the list brought the tape with them. I couldn\u0092t confirm it face-to-face of course, but even over the phone I got the feeling they were all being upfront with me.There\u0092re no traces of any illegal television signals being broadcast around Izu.Here\u0092s that copy of the videotape you wanted.No...There\u0092s something strange about this shot.From this angle, the mirror should be reflecting whoever\u0092s filming.Well, if the person who made this is a pro, there\u0092d be a way around that, I guess, but still...This is gonna be impossible to figure out on just a regular TV screen, don\u0092t you think?Asakawa. *He\u0092s used to it...What does that mean?Hello?But, dialect from where?Yoichi? I\u0092m gonna be a little late tonight, honey.You can do it yourself, right? OK. Sorry. Bye.I\u0092ve got it! This old article...What are you doing?I think so. There should be a correspondent out there.What do you think you\u0092re--?Yoichi says he\u0092s looking forward to doing some fishing with you.Hello?Have you got anything else?Oshima? I\u0092ve only got three days left!Nothing. I just had some things left over from work.Yoichi?Yoichi! You brought this with you, didn\u0092t you? Why?!?You mean that Tomoko\u0097Yoichi... he can see them too, can\u0092t he?It\u0092s all my fault. First Tomoko died, then those three others. It should have stopped there, but it didn\u0092t. Because of me.How did the rumors about the video even start in the first place?Fear...Mr. Hayatsu?Why did Yamamura Shizuko commit suicide?He was driven out of the university, wasn\u0092t he?I\u0092ve heard this story. But... I\u0092m sure I remember hearing that somebody died at one of those demonstrations.But, why even try looking for him?Please! If you could just answer a few questions, about Shizuko...It\u0092s about Shizuko\u0092s daughter.She did have a daughter, didn\u0092t she?Umm...You\u0092ll stay with me won\u0092t you? When it\u0092s time for me to die.You\u0092ll stay, won\u0092t you? If you stayed, maybe you\u0092d learn something that could help Yoichi--But you could stay with me, Ryuji. You\u0092d be OK.Stop it!That\u0092s right. After Yamamura Shizuko committed suicide, Professor Ikuma took the daughter and ran. No, no one knows where they went. That\u0092s why I need -you- to find out where they are. Even if the professor\u0092s dead, Sadako should still be in her forties. I\u0092ll explain it all later, but right now just hurry!Well, what about that video? If Sadako\u0092s dead then who made it?Hello?Thank you...Yoichi...Izu...Ryuji!Ryuji! The phone in my apartment never rang! It only ever rang at the rental cottage! Professor Ikuma must\u0092ve...It\u0092s funny. I\u0092m not afraid at all.So, Sadako was Professor Ikuma\u0092s daughter?Is that going to break the curse? Will Yoichi be all right?Just one more day...Yoichi? It\u0092s mommy. I just called to say I\u0092ll be coming home tomorrow.Yoichi, it\u0092s rude to your grandpa to talk like that.No, that\u0092s...I\u0092m sorry, Yoichi. I\u0092ll... I\u0092ll see you tomorrow.Mommy\u0092s got something she has to do. Say hello to grandpa for me, OK?Seven or eight minutes past seven. PM. No more than ten minutes past.The well...Her own father!It\u0092s already six!But, we don\u0092t even know if it\u0092s doing any good...Where are you? Please, come out.Please. Where are you?It\u0092s you...Why would Ikuma have killed her? His own daughter...What?...thank you.I\u0092m Takayama Ryuji\u0092s wife!What happened?Did he say anything to you? About a videotape?Ryuji... why? Does this mean that Yoichi will die, too? Is the curse not broken yet?I was the only one to break Sadako\u0092s curse. Ryuji... why...? Something I did that you didn\u0092t... Something I did that you didn\u0092t...Ryuji?!Something I did that you didn\u0092t...What broke the curse was that I copied the tape and showed it to someone else!Dad? It\u0092s me. I\u0092m on my way over. Look, dad, I\u0092ve got something to ask. It\u0092s for Yoichi...", "clean_line": "popular rumor going cursed videotape heard kind video let heard kind video watching tv late night know station izu know died watching wreck know high school girl went hm thanks wonder rumor ask mentions izu gifu big accident ended started rumor mmm hmm terrible like going stay people minds story happened gets twisted ends coming rumor like maybe tomorrow okazaki ask favor check article info good soon know ok yoichi sorry late oh ve changed aargh ve gotta hurry grandpa looks like sick yes hard auntie uncle going right harder let talk ok play lot dad sis holding ll check auntie said sign foul play shouldn walk people rooms downstairs ok ahead hello thanks excuse um kind strange question chance friends young girl died car know video tomoko chan watched cause death drugs mmm hmm yeah izu look probably going late coming home tonight stick dinner microwave ready eat ok hmm speak school hear way dad fat mom fat fat um actually business stayed august th information tape weekhis year ryuji recently money right ryuji people died day picture hurry guest list cottage look possibility hacking local station broadcast signals oh thanks uh sorry working personal happened think guests list brought tape couldn confirm face face course phone got feeling upfront traces illegal television signals broadcast izu copy videotape wanted strange shot angle mirror reflecting filming person pro way guess gonna impossible figure regular tv screen think asakawa mean hello dialect yoichi gonna little late tonight honey right ok sorry bye ve got old article think correspondent think yoichi says looking forward fishing hello got oshima ve got days left things left work yoichi yoichi brought mean tomoko yoichi fault tomoko died stopped rumors video start place fear mr hayatsu yamamura shizuko commit suicide driven university wasn ve heard story sure remember hearing somebody died demonstrations try looking answer questions shizuko shizuko daughter daughter umm ll stay won time die ll stay won stayed maybe learn help yoichi stay ryuji ok stop right yamamura shizuko committed suicide professor ikuma took daughter ran knows went need professor dead sadako forties ll explain later right hurry video sadako dead hello thank yoichi izu ryuji ryuji phone apartment rang rang rental cottage professor ikuma ve funny afraid sadako professor ikuma daughter going break curse yoichi right day yoichi mommy called ll coming home tomorrow yoichi rude grandpa talk like sorry yoichi ll ll tomorrow mommy got hello grandpa ok seven minutes past seven pm minutes past father know good come ikuma killed daughter thank takayama ryuji wife happened videotape ryuji mean yoichi die curse broken break sadako curse ryuji ryuji broke curse copied tape showed dad way look dad ve got ask yoichi"}, "RYUJI": {"raw_line": "Yoichi\u0092s in elementary school already, is he?Same as always.I\u0092m teaching at university.Anyway. You said that the phone rang?So if I watch it too, that phone over there--Well, why don\u0092t you try calling an exorcist?Turn this way.It\u0092s over.Well, it looks like your phone\u0092s not ringing.Make me a copy of this, will you? I\u0092d like to do a little research of my own. There\u0092s no reason to write us off as dead just yet.So, it was you. You did it.Hey.Nothing.So, what\u0092d you come up with?How about the other angle? Pirate signals or...Asakawa.Have you ever seen this woman?So, what does that mean?Volcanic eruption... Eruption where?Come on in.Asakawa, meet my student, Takano Mai.What\u0092re they talkin\u0092 to you about it for?Ask them to wait another week.OK, OK.This is impossible.Sada...Is Yoichi gonna be all right?Whoever made this had to have left some kind of clue behind. They\u0092re probably waiting for us to find it.Wait a minute.Shoumon bakkari, boukon ga kuru zo. Did you hear that, too?I\u0092m gonna check it out.I\u0092ve got it. It\u0092s a dialect, just like I thought. SHOUMON means \u0093playing in the water\u0094 and BOUKON means \u0093monster.\u0094 *Oshima. And the site of our \u0093eruption\u0094 is Mt. Mihara.Has your newspaper got someone out there at Oshima?I need you to find out, and let me know how to get hold of him. Tonight.You\u0092ve only got four days left, Asakawa! Your newspaper contact and I can handle this from here on out. You just stay with Yoichi.Yeah. Your Oshima contact came through. It looks like the woman who predicted the Mihara eruption is the same woman from the video.Her name is Yamamura Shizuko. She committed suicide forty years ago by throwing herself into Mt. Mihara.I\u0092m gonna have to check it for myself. I\u0092ll be leaving for Oshima tomorrow morning.I know. And I\u0092ve got four.I\u0092ll be in touch.I should\u0092ve been more careful. When I was at your place that day, I could feel something there. I thought it was just because of the video...That\u0092s not Tomoko. Not anymore.I wonder...This kind of thing... it doesn\u0092t start by one person telling a story. It\u0092s more like everyone\u0092s fear just takes on a life of its own.Or maybe it\u0092s not fear at all. Maybe it\u0092s what we were secretly hoping for all along.She was taking a real beating in the press, being called a fraud and all sorts of names. After a while she just lost it.Shizuko was getting a lot of attention around the island after predicting the eruption of Mt. Mihara. Seems that for some time she\u0092d had a rather unique ability: precognition. It was around then that she attracted the attention of a certain scholar whom you may have heard of; Ikuma Heihachiro.This Professor Ikuma convinces Shizuko to go to Tokyo with him, where he uses her in a series of demonstrations meant to prove the existence of ESP. At first she\u0092s the darling of the press, but the next thing you know they\u0092re knocking her down, calling her a fraud. Hmph. Forty years later, the media still hasn\u0092t changed that much.After getting kicked out of university, Ikuma just vanished, and no one\u0092s been able to get hold of him since. He\u0092s probably not even alive anymore.Because he\u0092s supposed to have had a child with Shizuko. A daughter.Separate, please.Aren\u0092t you gonna eat?Hm?Oh, stop it.I said stop it! Have you forgotten There was a girl with Tomoko when she died? That girl\u0092s now in a mental institution. Who knows what could happen.Why, because I\u0092m already not right in the head?If that\u0092s the case, why not just let things run its course, get rid of father -and- son? Yoichi was a mistake, anyway.We still have two days left...Come in.Is this Professor Ikuma?What kind of a child was Shizuko?Shoumon bakkari shite\u0092ru to, boukon ga kuru zo. \u0093If you keep playing in the water, the monster will come for you.\u0094Shizuko could see \u0093inside\u0094 people, couldn\u0092t she? Down to the places they\u0092d most like to keep hidden. It must have been difficult for her...I\u0092ve got a little of that ability myself. It was you who spread the word about Shizuko, wasn\u0092t it? And you who first contacted Professor Ikuma?You thought you\u0092d be able to make some money off her. You even got some, from one of the newspapers.Tell us about Shizuko\u0092s daughter. Who was she?She was there, with Shizuko. She had to be.You were there!You stood there and watched the demonstration.Sadako?!Sadako killed him? She can kill just with a thought?Sadako\u0092s probably already dead. She could kill people with just a thought, remember? Her mother wasn\u0092t even close to that.Nobody made it. It wasn\u0092t made at all. That video... is the pure, physical manifestation of Sadako\u0092s hatred.We\u0092ve been cursed.What about the fishing boats? Tell their captains I\u0092ll pay.Fine! I\u0092ll try searching myself!And we\u0092ve got no way of going back.Please. Take us out.Sadako probably died back out there at Izu, before the rental cottages were ever built.Ikuma smuggled her out in secret. His relationship with Shizuko was already a scandal, and one of the reasons he got drummed out of the university... We\u0092ve gotta find Sadako\u0092s body.It\u0092s all we\u0092ve got left to try.We made it. Maybe Sadako doesn\u0092t have it out for us after all.What time was it when you first watched the video?If the rumors are true, that time is gonna be our deadline.-Here-.I knew it! The well.It was Ikuma who put this lid on. And Sadako\u0092s still inside.I\u0092ll go.Sadako was alive! She\u0092d tried to climb her way out.Lower the buckets!Take it up!Take it up!I know! Hurry up and TAKE IT UP!!Take it up!Asakawa!What the hell are you doing? Trying to get me killed?Hey!Asakawa!We\u0092ll change. You\u0092re in no condition to keep this up.Who do you expect to pull up these buckets, then?And what about Yoichi, huh? Is his mother not coming to pick him up after all?Don\u0092t look down!Hey! Asakawa! It\u0092s already 10 minutes past seven! We did it!Maybe she wasn\u0092t his daughter at all.Maybe her father... wasn\u0092t even human.It\u0092s gone...Enough, already. It\u0092s over.
