Over.Professor Zundapp?What are you up to now, Professor?That's because it's air-cooled.Not here. You must try the canapes on the mezzanine!So the lab boys analyzed the photo I sent? What did they learn about the camera?This was London's message?How did we miss that?Who is it? Has anyone seen the photo yet?GOOD ---Oh no.Change of plan. You're meeting the American.Those thugs down there were on the oil platform. If they see me, the whole mission is compromised.You are now. CUT TO:Roger that. Move in.What's the problem, Shiftwell?So go in!Time is of the essence, Shiftwell.Is he American?Then it's him.It's his cover. One of the best I've seen, too. Look at the detail on that rust. It must have cost him a fortune.There's probably heat on him. Be patient.And then we find out who's behind all this.What is it?Anyone with him? He won't be alone.Get him out of the pits now!They're coming, Shiftwell.Get him out of there.Then this shouldn't hurt at all.Miss Shiftwell?Keep him moving. I'm on my way.I never properly introduced myself. Finn McMissile. British Intelligence.Who are you with? FBI, CIA?You're being followed.Don't worry.I've taken care of that. Hang on.Drive forward. Whatever you do, don't stop.Roger that.Thanks, old boy!Hold on, Sid!Now that's how I like to start the day! You never feel more alive than when you're almost dead.Finally. Time to see who's behind all this.Holley.Holley, in how many makes and models did this type of engine appear?This seems like a dead end. If there were something in the photo that could narrow this down a bit I'd be a lot happier.That's something we can track.Well done, Mater! I would never have seen that. I know of a black-market parts dealer in Paris, a treacherous lowlife. But, he's the only car in the world who can tell us whose engine this is. Mater, what would you say to setting up an informal task force on this one?You obviously have plenty of experience in the field.You're helping me. Please, Mater.Right. And I'm just in the import/export business. Siddeley?Paris. Tout de suite.Is there any other way?Once we're inside, stay close. Don't bother checking VIN numbers for criminal records, they're all dodgy here.Don't talk to anyone. Don't look at anyone. And absolutely, positively no idling. Are we clear?Mater?We're not here to go shopping.There you are.Mater, get back!Have you lost your mind?!Mater! This chap needs a tow. Hook him up.Allez! Maintenant - vite!Easy, Tomber. This is her first field assignment - she didn't know you were my informant.Tomber was doing 20 to life in a Moroccan impound the first time I saved him, if I recall correctly.Do those parts look familiar, Tomber?\"Lemon?\"Holley, pull up the pictures from the oil platform. I want to know what other type of cars were out there.Mater, are these cars considered lemons?And they're all taking their orders from the car behind this engine.What, Tomber?Where's this meeting taking place?Then there's a good chance our mystery engine will be there too.Holley, contact Stephenson and have him meet us at Gare de Lyon. Good work.Of course. They must be the heads of the lemon families.We've got to infiltrate that meeting. It's the only way to find out who's behind all this.Good job, Miss Shiftwell.Thank you, Stephenson.Perfect.The idea is to keep a low profile, Mater.And leave the rest to us.Friendships can be dangerous in our line of work, Mater.Right. And Miss Shiftwell's is designing iPhone apps.In the meantime...You look a little light on weapons.Get ready, Mater. CUT TO:You're on any moment now. CUT BACK TO:Impossible. Just apply the same level of dedication you've been using to play the \"idiot tow truck\" and you'll be fine.That's how everyone sees you. Isn't that the idea? I tell you, that's the genius of it. No one realizes they're being fooled because they're too busy laughing at the fool. Brilliant.He's so good.Here we go.Descramble that voice!What just happened?Holley?Where?Get out of the way! Andate!No!That's how everyone sees you. I tell you, that's the genius of it.No one realizes they're being fooled because they're too busy laughing at the fool.We're in London, Mater. Inside Big Bentley.Don't be a fool, Mater.When did I... Oh. Mater, I was complimenting you on what a good spy you are.I know.Nice try, Mater.There's no time. McQueen needs your help, Mater.It's up to you. Go to the pits and get everyone out. You can do that.We'll be okay.He wouldn't have left if I'd told him the truth. Being killed by a clock.

He can't disarm it!Mater, I don't know what you're doing but stand down now!Mater, he created Allinol.Mater!The engine from the photo.Our satellites picked up an urgent communique.We couldn't figure that one out either.We've got another mission, Mater.

Well, shoot, what am I doing here?I'll take one of them.Never know which one McQueen'll have a hankering for.Hey, what you got here that's free? How about that pistachio ice cream?Oh, same ol', same ol'. What's up with you? That looks delicious.Uh, a little more, please. It is free, right? Keep it coming. A little more. Come on, let's go, it's free! You're getting there... Scoop scoop!There you go.

Mater's fittin' to get funky!Well, hello.Well of course it doesn't. That's `cause it's air-cooled!Course, Karmann Ghia's weren't the only ones. Besides the Beetles you had your Type-3 Squarebacks, with the pancake motors...... And before both of them, there's the Type-2 buses - my buddy Fillmore's one of them.Uh, gee. Don't you think that's a little, uh ---Well, let's see. Tomorrow I'll be out there at the races.What's a rendezvous?A date?!Well, what's going on is I've got me a date tomorrow.Well, believe it.

Get on the outside and show 'em what Doc done taught you.Wow! Some of them fellers is really loud.Uh, what?Hey, I know you. You're that girl from the party last night. You wanna do our date right now?Is there gonna be cable where you is so I can watch the rest of the race?Well, all right but I usually like to have a proper detailing done before I meet a lady friend.Hey, new lady friend? You like flowers?Stay outside. Gotcha.What's that? You want me to head toward that ruckus?Wow! A live karate demonstration!That was cool! Hey, can I get your autograph?Hey, where'd he go?Dadgum, did I miss our date?Hey McQueen! What happened? Is the race over? You won, right?Yelling? Oh, you thought... that's funny right there. Nah, see that's `cause I seen these two fellers doing some sort of karate street performance. It was nutso. One of them even had a flamethrower ---Going to meet my date.She started talking to me as a voice in my head, telling me where to go ---Wait a minute -- I didn't screw you up, did I?Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean ---Maybe if I, I don't know, talked to somebody and explained what happened I could help.But I'm gonna miss my plane.Doggone it. This is about my hook, isn't it? I know I should've checked it, but I can't really, look -- it's attached to me.Hey, I know you. You're that feller from the karate demonstration.Tow Mater. Average intelligence.Let's just say I'm triple-A affiliated. You know, I know some karate. I don't wanna brag or nothing, but I've got me a black fan belt.Hey, you wanna see some moves I made up?This first one I can reach into a car's hood, pull out his battery, and show it to him before he stalls. I call it, \"What I accidentally did to my friend Luigi once.\"Look, I probably ought to go. I'm about to miss my flight.This is First Class service. You don't even have to go through the terminal.Your karate partners are back here. They kinda look like they're trying to catch up!Is everything okay back there?You remember that whole thing about me not stopping no matter what?I knew I should've done carry-on!Hey, doggone it. It's my imaginary girlfriend!Boy I tell you what, you really do want this first date, don't ya? That's a no-quit attitude right there.By the time you read this, I will be safely on an airplane, flying home.That's the closest I ever been to missing my flight! That was ---Yow!I gotta go to a doctor. I keep getting these sharp pains in my undercarriage.Hey, lemme introduce you two. This here is Finn McSomething-or- other. He's a First Class VIP airport whatchamacallit. And Finn, this here's my date. I never did get your name.It's Shiftwell. Holley ---Well, that's one of the worst engines ever made. It's an old aluminum V8 with a Lucas electrical system and Whitworth bolts. Shoot, them Whitworth bolts is a pain, tell you what. Them ain't metric, they ain't inches...Well, it's kinda hard to tell from this picture, ain't it?Agent? You mean like insurance agent, like, `Like a good neighbor, Mater is there'? Wait, you mean secret agents. You guys is spies!You're pretty.And so nice.You might not be happy, but I bet this feller is. See how he's had most of his parts replaced? And see all them boxes over there? Them's all original parts. They ain't easy to come by.Wait, what?Well yeah I live right next to one. I don't know, Finn. I ain't exactly been much help to anybody recently.Well, okay. But you know I'm just a tow truck, right?Yeah, two of them sweets for me too, Sid! You know, I always wanted to be a spy.Yeah, Finn?Shopping? What do you mean? Why would I ---Dadgum.You gotta be kidding me - they've got everything here. Look at them hoods! I could use a hood.Sorry fellers, I gotta go.Excuse me. What are you selling?Man, there are some great ---Hey, wait for me!Sure thing. CUT TO:Well, a lemon needs parts. Ain't nothing truer than that.Yeah, you know. Cars that don't ever work right. Lemons is a tow truck's bread and butter. Like them Gremlins and Pacers we run into at the party and the race and the airport.Is the Popemobile Catholic?That's where the next race is!Boy, I'll tell you what. That three- wheeled feller had to be right about a big meeting.You never see this many lemons in one town. Unless there's a swap meet, or something.Hey, how'd you get all them pictures?Wow, not only is you the prettiest car I ever met, but you the smartest too.That's a familiar sight.A Hugo being towed. But he looks absolutely perfect.Makes sense. If I was rich and broke down every day, I'd hire me to tow me around all the time too.What?Ahh!Boy, I sure wish my friends could see me now.What? I thought you was supposed to be making me a disguise.Cool! Hey, computer. Make me a German truck!Check it out. I'm wearing Materhosen. Make me a monster truck!I vant to siphon your gas. Now make me a taco truck!A funny car!So I just go in, pretend to be this truck.Hey, what are you doing?Oh. For a second there I thought you was trying to fix my dents.Well then no thank you. I don't get them dents buffed, pulled, filled or painted by nobody. They're way too valuable.I come by each one of them with my best friend Lightning McQueen.I don't fix these. I want to remember these dents forever.But my line of work is towing and salvage.No, I meant for real. I ---I don't know about this, Finn. What if I screw things up?It's just that them guys look pretty tough and --- Wait, did you say \"idiot\"? Is that how you see me?I, uh---Okay, okay. Computer: disguise.Wow, this place looks like it's made out of gold.Why is that? What do you mean don't talk to you? So you want me to stop talking to you. Right now?I have no idea what you're talking about......Alexander Hugo, aka \"Chop Shop Alex.\"Hey, you got a lot of aka's, Alex. But I guess that makes sense seeings how you's wanted in France, Germany, the Czech Republic...Oh yeah, it's unbelievable.Uh, of course I ain't leavin'.McQueen?No!Dadgum.Shoot. I didn't mean ---Whoa!!Wait wait! I didn't mean that kind of shoot!McQueen!Lemme through! Lemme through!You gotta let me in! I gotta get through to warn McQueen!No, listen! I was disguised as a tow truck to infiltrate this Lemonhead meeting and my weapons system misinterperated what I was SAYING ---McQueen! McQueen!McQueen!McQueen!McQueen!McQueen, they're gonna kill you!!Let me go!Idiot? Is that how you see me?Domo arigato!You done good! You got all the leaves!Now that's a scoop of ice cream!I never leak oil. Never.Wait a minute. I didn't screw you up, did I?Maybe if I talked to somebody, or---Bang a gong, get it on!Holley! Finn! Where are we?Woaaaah! ---This... this is all my fault.But I am, remember? You said so.I'm not a spy!I've been trying to tell you that the whole time. I really am just a tow truck.You were right, Finn. I'm a fool. And what's happened to McQueen is `cause I'm such a big one. This is all my fault.He's still alive?Backup plan??Dadgum lemons.Dadgum!Dadgum! Dadgum! Dadgum!DADGUMDADGUMDADGUMDADGUM ---I gotta get you all out of there!But I can't, I'm just a tow truck.What about you guys?What's everybody on the wrong side of the road for?!Everybody get out! Get out now! Y'all gotta get out the pits!Hey, what are you guys doing here?No! Everything's not okay! There's a bomb in here! Y'all gotta get out! Now!Finn! You're okay!Uh-oh.Stop right there!Don't come any closer!No, I'm not okay. Stay away from me!!Stay back! If you get close to me, you gonna get hurt real bad!McQueen, you don't get it. I'm the bomb!Stay away!Gotta keep away from McQueen.McQueen, let go!No way! You could get hurt!Yeah, they strapped it to me to kill you as a back-up plan.Deactivate! Deactivate!Fellers, listen.I know what you're going through. Everybody's been laughing at me my whole life too ------ but becoming powerful and rich beyond your wildest dreams ain't gonna make you feel better.I get it. I get it! I know what needs to be done.What? No, I can't do it. Look, nobody takes me seriously. I know that now. This ain't Radiator Springs.Thanks, buddy.Oh, right! Hang on!Computer!I need that thing you done before to get me away from McQueen!Now I need you to do the chute, the second kind not the first!Okay! Somebody's been sabotaging the racers and hurting the cars and I know who. Oh wait... Your Majesty.This ain't nothing at all like Radiator Springs.Okay.It's him.I figured it out when I realized you all attached this ticking time bomb with Whitworth bolts. The same bolts that hold together that old British engine from the photograph. Holley! Show that picture.And then I remembered what they say about old British engines - \"If there ain't no oil under `em, there ain't no oil in `em.\"It was you leaking oil at the party in Japan. You just blamed it on me.Then you're faking it. You didn't convert to no electric. We pop that hood we gonna see that engine from that picture right there.To make Allinol look bad so everybody'd go back to using oil. I mean, he said it himself with that disguised voice.Yeah, but what if he found that huge oil field just as the world was trying to find something else?What if he came up with Allinol just to make alternative fuel look bad?Now you're talking!\"Sir?\" Shoot, you can just call me Mater, Your Majesty. I don't wanna hear none of this \"Sir\" business. By the way, have y'all met each other? Queen? McQueen. McQueen, Queen. McQueen? McMissile.McMissile, McQueen. Queen? McMissile.So there I was: rocket jets going full blast, McQueen hanging on for dear life when suddenly them two nasty lemons come out of nowhere, guns drawed. We was goners. But then out of nowhere, this beautiful spy car swoops in from the sky to save us!Holley! Finn!What're you doing here?Oh, man. Y'all is gonna have a great time. Everybody! This here's Finn McMissile. He's a secret agent. Don't tell nobody. And this is Holley Shiftwell. She's ---Explode in a fiery inferno?Go McQueen!! Whoo-hoo!!!You're leaving already?Something tells me you're not talking about souvenir bumper stickers.But I told you all before. I'm not a spy.Well, thanks. But as much fun as it was hanging with y'all, this...This is home.Well, I sure appreciate that, thank you. Actually... there is one thing. CUT TO:Whoo-hoo!!!Check it out.

But we won't be long and ---Mater.How'd you like to come and see the world with me?You got me into this thing. You're coming along.Hey, look at this. Okay now Mater, remember: best behavior.Mater!Hey, Jeff. Lewis! CUT TO:Will you guys excuse me just for one little second?Mater, listen. This isn't Radiator Springs.Mater, look -- things are different over here. Which means maybe you should, you know, act a little different too.Well, just... help me out here, buddy. I ---Mater, no.Nice to meet you, Francesco.Mater's prone to exaggeration. I wouldn't say she's a \"big\" fan.Mentioning it once doesn't qualify as going \"on and on.\"Yeah, uh...Let's.Oh, sorry. I already dedicated MY win tomorrow to her. So if we both do it, it's really not so special. Besides, I don't have a drink.They're free, Mater.I should probably go keep an eye on him. See you at the race.That's cute. So you had one of those made up for all the racers?Okay.He is so getting beat tomorrow.Thank you so much for having us, Sir Axlerod. I really look forward to racing. This is a great opportunity.Sir Axlerod, I can explain. This is Mater.Mater!Mater, you have to get a hold of yourself. You're making a scene.Go take care of yourself right now.There you are. Where have you been?Mater, what's going on?Speed. I am speed.He is so getting beat today.Ten four, Mater.Nice call, Mater. Keep it up!Guys, a little too much chatter. Let's keep this line clear.What?Outside?Stop it, Mater. Just sign off.Mater.Mater, why were you yelling things at me while I was racing?A flamethrower? What are you talking about? I don't understand. Where were you?Your date?What?I lost the race because of you!An imaginary girlfriend, flamethrowers. This is exactly why I don't bring you along to these things.I don't need your help. I don't want your help.I made a mistake. But I can assure you, it won't happen again.Look, guys. We know what the problem is and we've taken care of it. SMASH TO:\"I'm so sorry for what I did. I don't want to be the cause of you losing any more races. I want you to go prove to the world what I already know - that you are the greatest race car in the whole wide world. Your best friend, Mater.\"I didn't really want him to leave.Well, at least I know if he's at home he'll be safe.No, Mama Topolino, please. You don't need to make a fuss!How'd you know that?I brought my friend Mater along on the trip. And I told him he needed to act different, that we weren't in Radiator Springs.He's my best friend.What did I do? I said some things during our fight...What does that mean?No, guys, I just really wish Mater were here.Oh, great. Here it comes. What've you got, Francesco?I think you forgot the insulting part of that insult.Gee, I maybe misjudged you, because that's exactly how I ---And there's the insult we were missing. Grazie!Yeah!That's what I'm talking about. Kachow! Hey, where are all the other cars?Oh no. CUT TO:I'm just in shock like everybody...Crashes are part of racing, I know. But something like that shouldn't ever happen.Allinol.My friend Fillmore says the fuel's safe. That's good enough for me. I didn't stand by a friend of mine recently. I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.Mater?That really sounded like Mater. Mater?Mater?!Excuse me.Scusi. Mater! Scusi...Mater, I'm so glad to see you. I'm so sorr ---Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I heard---What? Oh. I mean, thanks.I really thought I heard my friend.Wait, what?Will you guys excuse me just for one little second?Mater?!Mater, you have to get a hold of yourself. You're making a scene!I lost the race because of you!I don't need your help. I don't want your help!Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs. This is exactly why I don't bring you along to these things!I called to talk to Mater. It never occurred to me that he wouldn't be there.I know, but Sal, with everything going on I'm not sure I should---Sir Axlerod.No, no, it's all right.Listen, I ---All right. For Mater.Mater! There you are!Oh man, I've been so worried about you! CUT TO:Are you okay?No, wait. Wait! CUT TO:Mater, wait!Mater, wait!I know I made you feel that way before, but none of that matters because we're best friends! CUT TO:Yes, Mater! You are the bomb! That's what I'm trying to say here. You've always been the bomb! And you'll always be the bomb.No! Never!I'm not...letting you......get away again!Oh my gosh!Never!Bomb?Back-up plan? Mater, who put a bomb on you?Death ray?What do we do?I'm gonna go out on a limb here. These are the guys that want me dead, correct?What's he saying?! What's wrong!?Then do it!Yes it is.You're yourself in Radiator Springs. Be yourself here. And if people aren't taking you seriously, then they need to change. Not you. I know that, because I was wrong before. Now you can do this. You're the bomb.No no no, you're the actual bomb. Now let's go!Mater...No, no, it's okay! Tell them, Mater. Explain.Mater, just cut to the chase!It's official. You're coming to all my races from now on.Mater, let's go. You're on.Go get `em, buddy.You know, there's one thing I still don't get. The bad guys hit me with the beam from the camera, right? So why didn't I, you know...Yeah.Wait a second. Fillmore, you said my fuel was safe.I just figured, we never found out who the world's fastest car is. Plus: no press, no trophy. Just racing - the way I like it.Francesco. I'd like you to meet ---It's just something I had made up for the occasion.Yeah. Nice try.That's why I love you, Sally.

I have a message from London.It appears to be a standard television camera. They said if you could get closer photos next time, that would be great.Oh -- no, no. No sir. Um, the oil platforms you were on? Turns out they're sitting on the biggest oil reserve in the world.They'd been scrambling everyone's satellites. The Americans actually discovered it just before you did. They placed an agent on that platform, under deep cover. He was able to get a photo of the car who's running the entire operation.No, not yet. The American is here tonight to pass it to you. He'll signal you when he's ready.What is it?What, me?No, no. I'm technical, you see. I'm in Diagnostics. I'm not a field agent.The American has activated his tracking beacon.Oh, you've got to be joking.He's in the loo.I can't just go into the men's loo.This cannot be him.Extremely.Hello.A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator.Perfect. I'm from the Tokyo Station OF THE---Yeah. Okay, I get it---Listen! We should find somewhere more private.You're right. Impossible to know which areas here are compromised. So, when can I see you again?Got it. We'll rendezvous then.Why is he in the pits? He's so exposed.But why hasn't he contacted us yet?Right, of course. He'll signal us when he can.Hold on. I think I've got something.The Pacer from the party last night.Cross-referencing with the photos from the oil derricks... Yep. His VIN numbers match.Conducting analysis on the target.He's not the only one here. Three... five... they're everywhere. And they're all closing in on... oh no.Finn? Finn, where are you?Can you hear me? Over.Get out of the pit now. Do you hear me?There's no time for messing about. You've got to get out of the pits.You're running out of time!Yes, I know.I'm trying. Get out now!I've got him in the back alleys east of the garages. Multiple assailants are closing in quickly.No! Don't go 'in' anywhere. Just keep moving.You're doing brilliantly. Now just stay focused.No! Don't go down that street!Our rendezvous has been jeopardized. Keep the device safe. We'll be in touch.Come on! Get in here!I hope that device didn't fall off.Still in one piece, great.Downloading the photo now.Oh yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell. Holley Shiftwell.What is this?Yes, OK, right. But who's engine is this, Mater?But you're the one who took it.Oh, right. Yes, of course. \"A good agent gets what he can, then gets out before he's killed.\" Sorry.It was standard in seven models over a 12-year period. At least 35,000 cars were made with this engine.Yes, alright. Thank you.Just pay attention.Rare parts.Exactly!Really? Me too.No VIN scans. Got it.Yes, right. No idling. Yes, sir.But I thought ---Informant?Alright, we get it. You both know each other, you're both old. So.There you go, informant. Inform us.To whom?Right. Let's see. There were Hugos. And Trunkovs.Finn. Everyone involved in this plot is one of history's biggest loser cars.Well, I remotely reprogrammed Porto Corsa's red light cameras to do recognition scans.Thank you. I think.Hang on a minute.Hold still.Thank you, Finn.That should just about do it.So Mater, it's voice-activated. But you know, everything's voice- activated these days.Now hold still.I have to do the final fitting on your disguise.Oh dear. That's no good.The disguise won't calibrate effectively without a smooth surface to graft onto.I was.Your dents are valuable?So you were being serious in Paris? McQueen isn't just part of your cover?It's okay. Say no more. I'll work around the dent.Scusatemi, tutti! Signori!Mio nonno, my grandfather, has broken down. If one of you would help I would be so thankful.No, no, don't fight over me.Signore Tow Truck, per favore? CUT TO:Why aren't you in disguise?Come on, there's no time. Go!He's in.That's because it is, Mater. Now, be careful what you say.(cutting in to hisI'm trying... It's too sophisticated!I'm working on it.I'm detecting an extremely strong electromagnetic pulse.Finn, it's the camera!On the tower.Finn.Mater. Abort the mission. They've got Finn. Get out of there. Get out of there right now!Finn, he's not joking.Mater!Go and get some more dents, Mater.So we'll be \"okay\"? Really?Time. That's it!Trying to turn back time. If I can just reverse the polarity...Oh no!Done.They're standard issue now.Oh no. That's Mater's.Got it!Mater, stop!Oh no.Mater, we've got to get that bomb off you.Say it!He was getting on my nerves.O-kay...But Sir Axlerod created the race, Mater. Why would he want to hurt anyone?Mater!It's a perfect match!No, you're quite right. It does sound a bit far-fetched.Hello, Mater. It's so nice to see you again.I'm Mater's girlfriend. It's so nice to meet you all.Oh no no. I'm keeping that dent. It's way too valuable.Our investigation proved that Allinol was actually gasoline. And Miles Axlerod engineered it so that when it got hit by the beam it would explode.Finn, time to go.
