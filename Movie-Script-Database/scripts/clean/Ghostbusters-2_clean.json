I'll get the hang of this eventually.Thank you, Frank. Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom? I asked you last week.No, you didn't, Frank.That's exactly what you said last week.Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.Thank you, Janosz. I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.Actually, I'm not eating lunch today. I have an appointment. In fact, I'd better go.I'm sorry. Perhaps some other time.... and then the buggy just suddenly stopped dead in the middle of the streetHundreds of people. Believe me, I didn't imagine this.What are you working on, Egon?Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.Do you ever see him?How is he these days?Does he ever mention me?Well, we didn't part on very good terms and we sort of lost track of each other when I got married.I thought of calling him after my marriage ended, but --. Anyway, I appreciate you're doing this, EgonThis is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.Thank you.Hi, Ray. It's good to see you. Thanks for coming.Hi, Egon.Hello, Peter.I have. That's why I didn't call you first.He didn't \"ditch\" me. We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.Well, when you started introducing me as \"the old ball and chain,\" that's when I left.What do you think?His name is Oscar.Peter, this is serious. I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.I'll do it.We definitely had a moment or two.That's where the buggy stopped.A little to the left. Right there! That's where it stopped.Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.Janosz?We're fine, Janosz.No, everything's fine. Honestly. Thanks anyway.Good night, Janosz.I wish I could stay. I feel personally responsible for you being here.Please don't say that. You won't go to prison.You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?Good luck.Oh, hello, Peter.I didn't paint it. I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer. It's worth about ten million dollars.I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.Oh, I'm sorry. This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting. I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.Good-bye, Peter.Look at you. I think we got more food on your shirt than we got in your mouth.She picks the baby up off the bassinet and turns to place him in the tub. She is just about to lower him into the water when the tub starts to close up around the baby like a hugh mouth. Dana screams, snatches the baby away and runs from the room clutching Oscar to her bosom as the bathtub convulses and vomits up buckets of slime.I'm sorry. Were you on your way out?Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.I must be losing my mind. At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.I don't know what to do anymore.Peter, what about the bathtub?It was full of this awful pink ooze.Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.Really? And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.Thank you. Poor baby. I think I should put him down now.Yes, I'm very clean. Did they find anything at my apartment?They didn't find anything? In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing? So, what do I do now?I'm not here to date. I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.Does she know anything about babies?Okay, but it's not a date. It's a dinner.I put them in your hamper. I thought they were dirty.Hi.I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you. I just had to protect myself. You really weren't very good for me, you know.Why do you say things like that? You're so much better than you know.So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?Maybe I should call Janine.Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.I know what you were doing, Louis. It's all right.Typical. Peter was arrested. Has he called?Is everything all right with Oscar?Oh, good. I'll just check on him.You know you really don't have to stay. Peter should be back soon.Excuse me. I think Oscar is up.Louis!No!!Louis, you have to find Peter and tell him what happened.To get my baby back.What do you want with my baby?If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.Everybody has a choice.I don't care who he is. He's not taking my baby.We don't have a relationship.I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul. I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.I'd rather not.I think he likes you. I think I do too.That's not true.

Not a trace.Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.I think we hit the honeypot, boys. There's something brewing under the street.Hey, hey, hey, stresshound! Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble. The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.NYPRR. What the hell -- ? Help me lift this.Wow! It's an old airshaft. It just goes forever.Thanks, boys.Keep going -- more -- more --Lower -- lower -- Gee, this really is deep.Hold it! Steady!This is it, boys, the end of the line. Van Horne Station.

Call now, because we're still --If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.Merry Christmas!So will that be cash or a check?Oh good, you're here. Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.We've been studying the stuff that we took from the subway tunnel.No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.Now watch this.You worthless piece of slime!! You ignorant disgusting blob!!You foul, obnoxious muck!!I've seen some real crud in my time, but you're a chemical disgrace!!This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance! Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.Like a goat on garbage.We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --It really responds to music. Let's calm it down.It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.Watch this.Nothing. Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub. But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned. I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen. Listen to this:And he didn't die of old age either. He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.This guy was a bad monkey. He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy. Just before his head died, his last words were, \"Death is but a door, time is but a window. I'll be back.\"Mister, you have an Ecto-paritic, subfusionary flux in this building.Now if you don't want to be the -- -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal \"Stabilize -- All Clear.\"Let's sweep it, boys.I'll get one more reading.Huh? What?What? Yeah.No, I'm fine. I just got light-headed for a second there. Let's go.Idiot! Move it, you jerk!Are you telling me how to drive?Well don't think!No, I'm going to kill everybody!What happened?Yeah, I guess so. It was the strangest thing. I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop. This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all. Whew! Sorry, boys.We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow. We thought you might want to come along.Wow.Okay, but you're missing all the fun.This is it. Van Horne Station. Right where the old transit map said it would be.Let's get a sounding on the depth of that flow.Stand back.That's it. It's on the bottom.Let's get out of here, boys.Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.Oh yeah? Anytime, anytime. Just go ahead and try it.Butt out, you pencil-necked geek. I've had it with you.Don't you see? It's the slime. That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.That's all right, I see him.You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under it actually.Sorry!Uh -- well -- we had a little accident, but forget that. We have to see the mayor as soon as possible.We're not going anywhere with you. I told you we have to see the mayor now.You get enough negative energy flowing in a dense environment like Manhattan, it starts to build up, and if we don't do something fast this whole place will blow like a frog on a hotplate.We think the spirit of Vigo the Carpathian is alive in a painting at the Manhattan Museum.This is it. boys. It's starting. Shit-stormGood work, Louis. How did you get us out?It looks like a giant Jello mold.Okay, give it a rest, Captain. We'll take it from here.Throw 'em!Forget it. The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you. But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg. We just have to mobilize it.Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --Mr. Mayor, if we don't do something by midnight, you're going to go down in history as the man who let New York get sucked down into the tenth level of hell.I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.Okay, boys. Let's frost it.It's all yours, Pete. There's not much time left.She's moving!I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.I don't think they make Nikes in her size.My Fault!Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.Do it! Just do it!Groovy. I've never felt better in my life.I love you guys. You're the best friends I've ever had.Sir, you had a violent, prolonged, transformative psychic episode. But it's over now. Want a coffee?No, you're right on time.This is a bill for tonight's job.Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.My great-grandparents were Swiss.

Milt, your new book is called The End of the World. Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease. Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?This year? That's cutting it a little close, isn't it? I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right? So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year. And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.Well, for your sake, I hope you're right. But I think my other guest may disagree with you. Elaine, you had another date in mind?Valentine's Day. That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard. Anyway, we're just about out of time. Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets. Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ... ... Good night.Where do you find these people? I thought we were having the telekinetic guy who bends the spoons?Skeptical! Norman, I'm a pushover. I think professional wrestling is real.What's all this?The Mayor! He's a friend of mine.Lenny!Lenny! It's Pete Venkman!Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.I'm an old friend of the mayor's. I just want to say hello to him.No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about. We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.Okay, I get it. But I want you to tell Lenny that, because of you, I'm not voting for him.Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me. I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.So, no goat hooves, huh?Nowhere -- fast. Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?Egon!How've you been? How's teaching? I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?I don't even want to know where that is.Great. So what are you guys working on?Who?Oh, Ray --Who? Who? Who?Who, Ray?Hi, Dana.I knew you'd come crawling back to me.You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first. I'm still into all this stuff, you know. Haven't you ever seen my show?I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot. Let's go to work, boys.So what happened to Mr. Right? I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.He ditched you. You should've married me, you know.Men are very sensitive, you know. We need to feel loved and desired, too.I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.What are you going to do, Egon? Knit him a snowsuit?Yeah, you would. Is that for personal or professional reasons?Okay, kid. Up you go.Help! Please somebody help me! Get him off! Quickly! He's gone completely berserk!There's no doubt about it. He's got his father's looks. The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly. And smelly. You stink! It's just horrible. You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled. What's his name?Oscar! You poor kid!Unusual? I don't know. I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.I'll supervise.Well, Holmes, what do you think?What now, Brainiac?Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it? There's our old cash machine. And the dry cleaners we used to go to. And the old video store. We really had some good times, didn't we?Okay, let's take a look.What's that?I knew that.You mean like the time you got possessed and turned into a monster terror dog? No, not a chance. Total coincidence. Am I right?I love this. We're onto something really big. I can smell it, Ray. We're going to make some headlines with this one.Relax. We're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet, low key, no profile.What the hell's it look like we're doing? We're bustin out asses over here 'cause some douchebag downtown ain't got nothin' better to do than make idiots like us work late on a Friday night, right?You need the exercise.What, I got time for this? We got three thousand phones out in the Village and about eight million miles of cable to check.I told ya!Gas leak?You are personally responsible. If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?Don't worry about me. I'm like a cat.I'm El Gato. I always land on my feet.Thanks.Yes, I did. We were city champs.No, I think you've helped them enough already.Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway. That's where we come in.No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.Who are they?Maybe they just want to appeal.These boys aren't playing around.Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.Hey! Why don't you pick on someone your own size?Spengs, take the door. Ray, let's try and work them down and into the corner.Occupado.Case closed, boys. We're back in business.I'm Peter --Hold on, Ray! Half-price! Have you gone crazy?You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?I'm looking for Dana Barrett.Thanks. What's the other one?Yeah, really great. Take it easy.So this is what you do, huh?You're really good, you know.You know you can go to Art World and get these huge sofa-size paintings for about forty-five bucks.As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.How are you? What's that you're working on, Johnny?Too bad for the Moldavians.Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room. You know what it needs? A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.I'll let you get back to it. Nice meeting you.I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here. I'll call you. Later, Johnny!It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?And now you're going to eat it?This is what you do with your spare time?'Mood slime.' We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it.What kind of tests?You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?I don't care what you say. This could be a major Christmas gift item.So we'll put a warning on the label.Go ahead. I dare you.Just kidding.No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in. Are we having a pajama party?You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts. But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.Who could blame him? Were you wearing this nightgown?I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub. You better stay here.Now this kid has a serious nudity problem.This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.We'll take care of that. Ray, Pete. Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.Sounds like another slime job ... No, they're all right. They're here now ... Right ... Let me know.They're going over there right now. You might as well make yourself at home. Let me show you around. This is the cuisine de maison --We may have to wash some of these if you get hungry -- -- but there's no food anyway so forget about it. I have all kinds of carry-out menus if you feel like ordering.Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.The shower works but it's a little tricky. They're both marked \"Hot.\" It takes a little practice, but at least this one won't try and eat you.Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free. In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me. If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.Or we could do that.I'll put him down for you. You are way too short! And your belly-button sticks out! You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!Did you find anything at Dana's?A hundred and five years? He really hung on, didn't he.That's it? \"I'll be back?\"We're just going up to Restorations for a minute.Okay, we were trying to keep this quiet but I think you can be trusted. Tell him, Ray.I know.We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list. Your name was first.You know, I never got to ask you. Where you from, Johnny?We'll know when we find it. You just sit tight. This won't take long.This is the one that looked at Dana.I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory. If she says it looked at her, it looked at her. Hey, you! Vigie! Look at me. I'm talking to you. Hey! Look at me when I'm talking to you.Beautiful, beautiful. Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it. Okay, he's playing it cool. Let's finish up and get out of here.Not. Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.Yeah, that's a safe bet. You and Spengman see what else you can dig up on Vigo and this little weasel Poha. Those two were made for each other.You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.Watch him, Egon. Don't even let him shave.I'm home!I knew it. She cleaned.Are you all squeaky clean now?Nothing. They stayed there all night, went through your personal stuff, made a bunch of long-distance phone calls and cleaned out your refrigerator. And didn't find anything.Now you get dressed and we go out. I got a babysitter and everything. Trust me, you need it.It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff. She's one of my most valuable employees.Janine Melnitz, are you kidding? Do I have a vase? I brought some of your clothes. Wear something intriguing. I brought along some interesting possibilities.Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?I have a hamper? Next time ask me first, okay. I have more than two grades of laundry. There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.These aren't so bad yet. You just hang them up for a while and they're fine.Don't tell me, let me guess. All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?Darn it! I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.Roach breeding? Sounds better and better. Dana? The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime. Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge. Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys. Let me know what you find out.Here's to -- us.So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?All right, you want to be real? So tell me why did you dump me?I'm not even good for me.Thank you. If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.Let me jingle you right now.Don't worry. Janine has a very special way with children.Yeah, sorry I missed it. I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here. It's really kind of a coat and tie place.Boys, listen. You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?Hey, don't be an idiot. This is serious.Oh, yeah?Finish your dessert -- it's already paid for. I'll call you.I just want to get your names right for when the mayor asks us why we didn't let him know about this sooner.I don't think he's ready for the toaster.Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you? The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.Now you're talking.Don't look at me. I think they're nuts.It better not start yet. I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.What kind of dog?Habitual liars. They can't help it. It's in the breed.Yeah, well guess again.I hate Jello.Well, better late than never.Okay, who knows \"Cumbaya?\"All right. Nice and sweet -- Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya --Good effort. Now what? Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?And pure --Oh, you think so? Well, I've got news for you. You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid. Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants. And that's just round one.We tried to tell you last night, but Mr. Hard-On over here packed us off to the loony bin.Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?If she's naked under that toga. She's French, you know.Only one way to find out. Ready, Teddy?Okay, one, two, three, four --Okay, Libby. Let's get it in gear.It's okay. I have my Senior Lifesaving card.Are you kidding? We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th. I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth. Trust me, I used to drive a cab.They love you, Lib. Keep it up.So far so good.We're almost there, Lib. Step on it.She's new in town.Happy New Year.Oh, Johnny. Did you back the wrong horse.The whole city's together on this one. We took a vote. Everybody's down on you, you know.Oh, no. We've got to live with this?Hey, I just had this suit cleaned. Take care of the wiggler, will you.What is this -- a love in? Hey, sailor. I think the tattoos are a little much, don't you?Finally came to your senses, huh?She's all right. She's just sleeping it off.This probably isn't a good time to bring this up, but the last time we did a job for the city you stiffed us.I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?Pretty impressive, huh?From where -- Neptune?Ostrov? I've been there. Good party town.Oh, right, you told me that. They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall. How about you, Winston?Miss Blue Blood? Her family's been here since the year 12.Same difference.Me? I'm a little of everything. Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around. And that's what made this country great.So what? It's a free country.
