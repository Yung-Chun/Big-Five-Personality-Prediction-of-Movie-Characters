How are you?Good ... good. And how's your mother doing, Linga?Good.It says, \"He can win an election, but can he run a country?\"It's a legitimate question.Good morning everybody.Barbara, good morning.

And all the packing boxes.Now, of course, if you want to leave, that is your right. And if you feel in your heart that you cannot work with your new government, then it is better that you do leave, right away.But if you are packing up because you fear that your language, or the color of your skin, or who you served previously, disqualifies you from working here now, I am here to tell you, have no such fear. Wat is verby is verby. What's past is past. We look to the future, now.We need your help. We want your help. If you would like to stay, you will be doing your country a great service.I ask only that you do your jobs to the best of your abilities, and with good hearts. I promise to do the same. If we can manage that, our country will be a shining light in the world.You look agitated, Jason.What have you done?Yes. They've had special training, those boys -- with the SAS. And lots of experience. They protected De Klerk.You asked for more men, didn't you?In public, when people see me, they see my bodyguards, too. You represent me, directly. The rainbow nation starts here. Reconciliation starts here.Yes, I know. Forgiveness starts here, too.Forgiveness liberates the soul. It removes fear. That is why it is such a powerful weapon, Jason.Please try it.Only what is necessary.Good luck, captain.Thank you for honoring our new flag!Oh, yes, of course.Shall we work while we watch? We have lots of promises to keep.It's not too late, if the boys can just pick up their game.Where the money is. America, England, Saudi Arabia.It's also a constitutional right.Look at that. The whites are cheering for the Springboks, the blacks are cheering for the Lions.We did that on the island, you know. We supported anyone but the `boks.

I'm going to bed. Good night.I delegate that decision to you.No.No.Your advice is duly noted, Barbara.Yes, I know. But in this instance the people are wrong. And it is my job as their elected leader to make them see that.Can you tell the boys that Madiba wants to go to Eersterust, very fast.The day I am afraid to do that is the day I am no longer fit to lead.Brothers, sisters, comrades, I am here because I feel strongly that you made a decision today without sufficient information or foresight.I am aware of your earlier vote. I am aware that it was unanimous. Nonetheless, I propose that we restore the Springboks. Restore their name, their emblem and their colors, immediately.Let me tell you why ...... on Robben Island, in Pollsmoor Prison, my jailers were all Afrikaners. For twenty seven years, I studied them. I learned their language, I read their history, I read their poetry. I had to know my enemy, in order to prevail against him. And we prevailed, did we not? All of us here ... we prevailed.Our enemy is no longer the Afrikaner. They are our fellow South Africans, our partners in democracy.And they treasure Springbok rugby. If we take that away, we lose them. We prove that we are what they feared we would be. We have to be better than that.We have to surprise them with compassion, with restraint, and generosity.Yes, I know. All the things they denied us.But this is not the time to enjoy a moment's petty revenge. This is the time to build our nation using every single brick available to us - - even if that brick comes clothed in green and gold.You elected me. You elected me to be your leader. Let me lead you now. Who is with me on this?Who is with me?A luxury. All we needed was one more yes than no.Well, as you know, I am an obedient party member.But, I must. This minority still controls the army, the police, and the economy. Without them, we cannot address the other problems.It's a human calculation. If we take away what they cherish -- the Springboks, their national anthem -- we just reinforce the cycle of fear between us.I will do what I must to break this cycle. Or it will destroy us.The millions of our people say thank you, and thank you again.I have come here with a message. People of the Unites States of America: Open your markets to us. People of the United States of American: Come and invest in our country.I'm fine.Travelling the world, begging for money, is very tiring.This is for you.Morning boys.How is your family, Hendrick?I have a very big family. 42 million people.I don't think I want to walk today.Hello Barbara. I like that dress.What is it?This is terrible.Francois, what an honor. I'm so excited.Thank you for coming all this way to see me.Tell me. How's your ankle?I was told you'd hurt it. Has it healed?Yes ... yes. In sports, and in life. Come. Sit. Please. Take this one. Looking into the light hurts my eyes.Ah, Mrs. Brits ---- you are a shining light in my day.Mrs. Brits, this is Francois Pienaar. He's the captain of the Springboks.No thank you, I think I'd like to.How do you take your tea, Francois?The English have given us many things, including rugby, but afternoon tea is one of the greatest.You have a very difficult job.Captain of the Springboks. A very difficult job.Ah, but then nobody is trying to tear my head off while I'm doing mine.It is not so difficult to get people to do their best. And I imagine that anybody who plays for their country does their best, almost automatically.Yes. But to get people to be better than that?Better than they think they can be? Now, that is difficult, I find.How do we do that? By example? To an extent. But there is more to it than that ... (searching for the rightHow do we inspire ourselves to greatness, when nothing less will do? How do we inspire everyone around us? Sometimes, I think, by using the work of others.On Robben Island, when things were very hard, I found inspiration in a poem.A Victorian poem. Just words. But they helped me to stand when all I wanted was to lie down -- But you didn't come all this way to hear an old man talk about things that make no sense.Yes ... yes. Everybody is preparing.Yes! I remember when I was a guest at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. The whole stadium welcomed me with a song. At the time the future -- our future -- seemed very bleak. But to hear that song, in voices from all over our planet ... it made me very proud to be South African. It helped me to come home and do better. It allowed me to expect more of myself.Well, it was Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika. A very inspiring song.We need inspiration, Francois.Because, in order to build our nation, we all need to exceed our own expectations.Excuse me.What do you think?Yes, it does.You criticize without understanding. You seek only to address your own feelings. This is selfish thinking. It does not serve the nation.Wait. Please. I --Will you give this to your mother.A bracelet.I don't have the right to. It's not mine.The Ivory Coast qualified. This is wonderful.According to the experts, you and I are still supposed to be in jail.A billion people watching us! (wheels turning in hisPlease call the head of South African rugby for me.Please call President Clinton for me. I wish to offer him our condolences.Do you see why forgiveness is essential, Jason? Revenge only begets revenge.Mr. Minister, please forgive me. This sounds excellent, and we will return to it, but if you'll indulge me for just one minute --You see, that picture is worth any number of speeches.Around the world -- objectively -- what are they saying about our chances against Australia?So it is very important that we beat Australia. Thank you.I'll be right out.Barbara, I have been studying.No. Not exactly.Test me.Block out the names. See if I can recognize them.Andre Joubert.Gavin Johnson. Did I get them right?(immensely pleased withPeople do not realize that I once played rugby myself, when I was a student at Fort Hare. It is a very rough game. Almost as rough as politics.I think they will do very well. Their level of commitment is tremendous.Obviously, that is no longer true. I am one hundred percent behind our boys.After all, if I cannot change when circumstances demand it, how can I ask others to?Francois, gentlemen -- forgive me for interrupting your work the day before such an important match ... ... I just wanted to wish you good luck, in person.And sometimes, very seldom, as President, I am allowed to do what I want.I know who this is. Good luck, Andre.

The country is excited tonight.The doctor has no sense of occasion.What man would not be pleased to be dancing with a beautiful woman like you?Indeed not. My father was a Xhosa chief, and therefore a polygamist. As you know, I am not. But when I look at you ... I envy my father.Out of the night that covers me, Black as the pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul.In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud.

Of course.145 points, in one match?45 to 29. And it was not that close. They seem unstoppable.Their Maori war dance. Yes. It's very powerful.How are we going to beat them?No ... no.
