{"Awakenings": {"SAYER": {"raw_line": "When you say people ... you mean living people, . Behind an old oak desk, the hospital's Director glances over to its Chief of Medicine, Dr. Kaufman, with a look that seems to wonder, As opposed to what?I ' m here for the research * position . . . in your neurology * lab.Earthworms. The Director isn't sure he heard right.It was an immense project. \" I was trying to extract a decigram of myelin from four tons of earthworms.I was on it for five years. I was the only one who really believed in it. The rest of them said it couldn't be done. tWell, I know that now. I proved it. The director offers a slow tentative nod before consulting the resume again.Pigs brains . . . theyre quite similar to human brains.Oh, yes . . . three years. As the Director retreats back to the resume, hoping against hope of finding in it something germane, Sayer glances away to a window. He wishes he were outside it. He has no business being here. He should leave.Excuse me, I made a mistake coming here. Clearly you're looking for someone with more of a clinical background. He stands up to leave. Kaufman stands to see him out. But the * director keeps searching the resume.I guess not. As they pass an old patient in a wheelchair -I think I am. Sayer extends his hand. Instead of shaking it -Mrs. Cohen?I 'm here. To examine you.Excuse me. Mrs. Cohen's son. He's coming today? NURSE 1 I wouldn't bet on it, he hasn't for twenty years. The nurse turns away. Sayer crosses slowly back to Mrs. Cohen, trying to find the words to tell her. He doesn't have to; his discomfort does it. Her hand slowly reaches up and pulls the ribbon from her hair. 13. OMITTED .According to the neighbors, * she's never set foot outside her * apartment, has no other living * relatives, and has always been the * way she is now - without any * comprehension or response. *And yet . . . Without any warning whatsoever Sayer tosses a tennis ball at her. Her hand suddenly jerks up out of her lap and catches it. And stays there, stiff, still. Sayer is delighted but the expression on Kaufman's face is that of one who has long ago learned and tired of simple card tricks. Dismissing the phenomenon --If she batted it away I might call that a reflex. She doesn't bat it away, she catches it.I'm sorry, if you were right I'd agree with you. Kaufman, understandably, takes some offense at the comment. Sayer, however, is unaware that he has caused any.It's as if . . . having lost all will of her own on which to act, she borrows the will of the ball. Awkward silence. Eventually--One . . . . Two . . . Three . . . Four . . . Five. Just as he's depressing the accelerator, someone raps on his window. He slams on the brakes. Miss Costello's face appears at the window. Recovering, Sayer rolls it down.What'd I forget?Thank you . . . He glances to his rear view mirror and can see her walking away toward her car. To the reflection --Thank you very much.What did the voice say?Did you recognize it as belonging to a person? Or was it just a voice? Sidney considers Sayer suspiciously ... then smiles slyly. *Me? Sayer is taken aback. As is Sidney. One of them, and Sidney believes he knows which, is lying or crazy. ' ' * SAYER ' . I do deny it. It wasn't me. It wasn't real. We've only just now met, sir. \u00bb Sidney, suddenly completely disoriented, withdraws.Ye .... Sayer glances up at them, having paid attention to nothing they've said, and nods at some other thought. . ' SAYER Yes . . . ,' He leaves his tray where he stands, and heads out of the cafeteria. vDid you see me when-1 \"spoke?\" Sidney thinks about it, tries to remember, to summon back the moment in question, to picture it exactly as it happened, or didn't happen.You see me now though.There must be more recent files we missed somehow. \"Part Twos\" to their medical histories. In some other filing cabinet somewhere. . ..One would think that after a point enough atypical somethings would amount to a typical something. But a typical \"what?\" Miss Costello, no doubt, has less of an idea than Sayer what the \"what\" could be.Ah . . . normally I'd say yes . . . only I've made other plans . . . She nods quickly. She seems, strangely, relieved.Yes.Good night. They veer apart to their respective cars.P e s . '...- lae The waiter leaves. Sayer glances back into the fish tank at the eel behind the rock, its rock, its home.They all survived encephalitis years before they came here. In the 1920' s . He taps a finger at the files - the patients' medical histories prior to admission - forms listing childhood diseases and ailments. The janitor, having no idea of course what he means, retreats with his pail and mop, closing the door. 36A. EXT. MEDICAL LIBRARY, NEW YORK - ESTABLISH - DAY 36A. 37. INT. MEDICAL LIBRARY, NEW YORK - DAY 37. Sayer displays what he has written on the back of his hand to an assistant librarian: NEJM 4-6-35.The New England Journal of Medicine, April 6th, 1935. *Should I get your nurse?Five. So far. I think there may be more. The old doctor nods. He has the torn look of someone reminded of an unfaithful lover just when he'd managed to forget about her. He wants and doesn't want to know how they're doing. Finally --As you described them. As they were back then. As \"insubstantial as ghosts.\" Only I guess most of them were children then.What must it be like to be them? On the screen, the young man's eyes, entranced, gaze upward as if trying hard to remember something. Or trying hard to forget it.What are they thinking? . OLD DOCTORWe know that for a fact.Bec use . . .Sorry. .Quite. It's quite bad. Sayer keeps studying it.Did he fail to understand? Or was he unwilling to fail? He isn't really asking her to answer, which is fine with her since she doubts equally both hypotheses.Could he be saying, \"I can't draw a triangle, don't make me\"? Could it be willfully bad? She doesn't say it but it's clear she thinks Sayer is reading far too much into the \"badness\" of the patient's scrawl. To himself -Which one is this? He leans closer to see the typed name . . .He speaks to you in other ways. How do you mean? MRS. LOWE i You don't have children.No. ,I'd like to examine him again-if that's all right with you. MRS. LOWE , He did well.In a sense.Does this mean anything to you? MRS. LOWE . ; It's very good. ' She glances back to Sayer who nods uncertainly. She recognizes. the look on his face; she's seen it before on the faces of more doctors than she cares to remember. ' fWhat'd he do with himself, Mrs. Lowe, those nine years he stayed in this room? She smiles to herself, proudly it seems.Living people, yes. Patients. Mann just stares. He's a scientist, they both are, and the idea of Sayer working with living people, rather than expired ones laid out on the pathology table, is inconceivable to him.It's in The Bronx. It's a poor private chronic hospital called M ou nt --How's Hank?Subtract two seconds off his time.You have them backwards. This is him awake . . . This is him asleep.When there's any brain activity at all, which is infrequent, yes. Dreaming or hallucinating.When he's asleep he manages to create a kind of reality. What we might call reality.1 don't know. Mann studies the \"waking\" EEC He points to its one and only large electrical peak. ;No. This is the strobe. Sayer indicates a flat section of the pattern where there is scribbled in pencil a small \"s.\"This . . . , / . . . is me saying his name to him. Mann stares rather dumbly at Sayer. Then at Hank the monkey on the floor dealing solitaire.Can you hear me, Leonard? I want to hear you speak your name. :Yes, so am I. > The moment Fernando takes the record off, Rose stops eating, stops moving. The orderly puts on Mozart and waits. Neither patient moves.That's not true.Is it a real game I wonder?Yes. 62. OMITTED ,I'll begin moving the pointer toward the \"L.\" For \"Leonard.\" Once I feel you beginning to move it, I'll stop and you'll take . over. Do you understand? Leonard, of course, cannot say whether he does or not. The look on his face is \"thoughtful.\" The look on Sayer's, hopeful and foolish.I'm beginning . . . The pointer begins to slowly move past stars and moons. Judging from Sayer's expression he begins to feel Leonard's movement of it and, presumably, stops his own.Yes, good . . . The pointer moves across the letters, but passes the \"L\" without stopping. It stops on the \"R.\"No. No, I didn't make myself clear. My fault. I . . . . The pointer begins moving again, \"interrupting\" Sayer. It passes the \"L\" again, reaches the \"I\" and stops. SAYER ' \"., No. No, I . . . . .Yes. Yes. That's what I meant. . \"L.\" Good. Now the \"E.\" It begins moving again. But not to the \"E.\" To the nK,\" where it hesitates briefly before moving again.. . . you're spelling something el e . . . Keeping one hand on the moving pointer, Sayer fumbles a pen from his shirt pocket and scribbles on his lab coat what Leonard has and is continuing to \"write\": RILKESPAThank you. Yes. Yes, I'm very much interested in your work with this drug. I'm curious if . . .Sayer. I'm curious if you . . .If jail the compulsions in the Parkinson's patient were somehow accelerated - - the hands, the shaking, the tics, the head bobbing, the quickening speech - - might they not cave in on themselves and, in effect, turn the person into stone? He comes to a abrupt stop, his eyes transfixed like a post- encephalitic's, staring. The chemist slowly dries his hands with a paper towel.With all due respect, I think it's rather too soon to say that.Did you read the case - the husband who came home to find his wife singing. She hadn't felt like singing in years. Kaufman, on the phone, glances to Sayer long-sufferingly, lets him wait while he finishes with his call, and eventually sets down the receiver.What I believe, what I know, is that these people are alive inside.I know it. Sayer doesn't elaborate, but his tone is resolute. And it has the intended effect on Kaufman, causing him to consider the possibility that Sayer could, somehow, know it as a fact.All of them ... some of them ... one of them . . .He asked me to leave. . Kaufman nods like, Just checking. And - KAUFMAN . Good luck. Sayer leaves.People with ordinary Parkinson's Disease sometimes complain that they've \"lost their grace . . . \" They have to think about the things we just do . . . It has to do with a chemical in the midbrain, or rather the lack of it, called dopamine. L-Dopa replenishes this dopamine, making it possible for these patients to move more naturally. He picks up the cup again, gracefully, and sets it down.I don't know what it'll do for him, if anything.I don't know.I hope it'll bring him back from wherever he is.To the world.You are here. She ponders that and the enormity of the whole situation, all the while staring at the consent form.I have no idea. What do you say we ease into it with ... what, \u00bb . fifty milligrams? Ray begins to measure five milligrams.Let's say a hundred. Ray shrugs; it's okay with him. He knifes at the powder, removing all but 100 milligrams.Leonard? Your mother's going to give you some juice. There's medicine in it which is why it may taste more bitter than usual. Sayer glances to Mrs. Lowe. It's as if they've rehearsed it all. She holds the glass to her son's lips and gradually drains the liquid down his throat. Nothing immediately happens, of course, but they all, with the exception of Leonard, look as if they expect it to. Mrs. Lowe hands the empty glass back to Sayer. And they all wait.Or maybe it's not enough.I'll try it in milk.I'll call if there's any change.Yes, I'll call. They nod \"good night\" atT each other and Miss Costello leaves. Sayer slumps into Leonard's wheelchair. lAnd waits.It's late. Everyone's asleep>No. You're awake. Though he nods, it's unclear whether Leonard realizes how significant that is. Sayer gestures at the piece of paper beneath Leonard's hands.May I? Sayer draws the paper across the table. It's covered with what seems imponderable hieroglyphic-like scrawl. But there is order in the chaos. Letters. Leonard's name.Your mother is here. She appears in the doorway of the room. She's done her hair, her face, she's put on a nice dress, yet she remains unprepared for this reunion. She can do nothing but stare at her \"infant son\" who is now, \"suddenly,\" a man. As he slowly crosses toward her, she is struck by the fact she must look u\u00a3 in order to meet his eyes. He reaches her. Reaches out to her. And she embraces him.He must.Splendid. Sayer makes a note. They are alone in the examination room which, like most of the hospital, has little in it to indicate that it is not the 1930's.Can I see you walk the length of the room? * Leonard walks slowly across the room past the perception tests and notes and Polaroids cluttering the wall. Coming back, he pauses. He's looking at a picture of himself taped there. Sayer watches him slowly reach his hands to his face to feel his features. He stares at the photograph of himself, trying to comprehend that which cannot be comprehended. He's not younjg anymore. 98. OMITTED 99. INT. LEONARD'S WARD - NIGHT 99. Sayer and Mrs. Lowe at Leonard's bedside.. . . you'll sleep. And when you wake up in the morning, it will be the next morning. I promise. Sayer's smile tries to assure them both that it will happen just that way. He excuses himself, leaving Leonard with his mother, joins Miss Costello by the door and glances back. Mrs. Lowe is stroking Leonard's head as she hums a lullaby.I didn't sleep, did you?Do you know if Leonard's awake? She smiles and points toward the adjoining examination room.Been waiting for me long?Some things have happened while you've been away. I thought you'd be interested. Leonard opens one carefully, reverently, and begins reading from it to himself.You don't have to read them now, Leonard. They're yours. At your leisure. Leonard closes the book but holds onto it and the others like they're gold.Have you thought about what you'd like to do today?I'm not sure I can arrange that.Let's approach it this way. What . \". x do you think you'd like to do . 1J first? ..Yeah. Well, five years ago. , Sayer shrugs, disappears into the kitchen a moment . . . before ; peeking back in to see what Leonard is looking at now: a small i framed photograph of a boy with a toy sailboat and a forlorn expression posed in front of a curtain; the boat obviously a photography studio prop.Me, actually. ' ,,\" tI probably was. Sayer disappears into the kitchen again. And a moment later glances back in around the door frame at Leonard who has moved over to an old sideboard on which several pairs of glasses are neatly arranged.Each has a specific purpose.Those are my normal interior glasses. And spare pair. Those, I wear outside. Two pairs, in case I los.e one. Those, those are my daytime reading glasses. And spare. Those are for close work. For fine print. Those are my nighttime reading glasses -That's heavy-gauge metal so when I fall asleep and roll over on them I don't wreck them. They're indestructible. Leonard returns the indestructible ones to their proper place and considers them all together.As long as I pretty much know ahead of time what I'll be looking ' at, it works out, I don't have to carry all five pairs around.Walks are a problem. Walks are the hardest thing. You just never know. He's absolutely serious, like a man plagued for years by an imponderable dilemma. He retreats back into his kitchen before reappearing again with the pot of tea, two mismatched cups and some saltine% on a tray.I hope you'll forgive the inelegant presentation. I don't entertain much. / .I can date my interest in science precisely, actually. I'd been * sent off to boarding school - a place perhaps not quite as Dickensian as I remember it - when I happened to come across the periodic table of elements. I memorized it. Which I admit was a rather precocious thing for a seven year old to do. And I remember feeling . . . not so much a sense of accomplishment . . . as comfort. The halogens were what they were. The alkali metals were what they were. Each element had its place, and nothing could * change that. They were secure, no * matter what. * Leonard nods, perhaps more out of politeness than * understanding. Sayer nods too, feeling, perhaps, a little * exposed.No. He smiles. Sips his tea. Silence except for the ticking of a * clock somewhere. Then, very matter of factly -I'm not terribly good with people. I like them. I wish I could say I had more than a rudimentary understanding of them. Maybe if they were less unpredictable . . . He shrugs. Silence again.-~ Eleanor? ^r * LEONARD Miss Costello.Oh, yes, of course. She's spoken to you about me? Leonard nods. Sayer can't imagine why, nor what she might have said. Fearing the worst --What'd she say? LEONARD ' That you're a kind man. That you care very much for people. Sayer shifts in his chair uncomfortably. a.We should be getting back. Sayer crosses over to the sideboard, to the pairs of glasses, stares at them for several moments, and picks up two pairs. 114. OMITTED 114 114A. EXT. PARKING LOT - BAINBRIDGE - DAY 114A. Climbing out of his car, Kaufman sees Sayer striding toward him. He glances to the sky, Kaufman, to God, and silently complains to Him. 115. INT. STAFF CAFETERIA, BAINBRIDGE - LATER - DAY 115 Cafeteria workers carting serving trays back to the kitchen. Nurses and orderlies and office workers at tables with finished' meals and cups of coffee. They seem unaware of Drs. Sayer and Kaufman at a table near the door.About a month.I was thinking of speaking to the patrons.Well, we'd have to convince them to give more than they*re accustomed to giving.Perhaps if they saw Mr. Lowe.Virtually aphonic, Mr. Lowe could articulate no words, but rather only, with considerable effort, an occasional noise, a kind of, \"h .. . \" In the darkness sit Kaufman, the rest of the Board of Directors, some elderly patrons of the hospital, and, near Sayer, Miss Costello. She hands him a scribbled note. \"Less scientific\" it reads.Isolated circumstances -- the mention of his name, notes of particular pieces of music, the touch of another human being -- managed on occasion to briefly summon him, but these awakenings were rare and transient, lasting only a moment or two. Sayer glances to Miss Costello. She nods, \"Good, that's better.\"The rest of the time he remained in a profoundly eventless place ~ deprived of all sense of history and happening and self -- encysted, cocooned, enveloped in this metaphorical if not physiological equivalent of sleep . . . or death. Tight on the screen, on Leonard, as he was. Looking more like a photograph of a man than a motion picture of one.This was his condition when first seen by me in a remote bay of this hospital. And the quality of his life for the last 30 years. The \"before picture\" of Leonard on the screen is replaced with the \"after\" -- his eyes alert, his hands exploring a desk microphone. He glances up and off at something.Wonderful. v 119. 119. OMITTED 120. INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - DAY 120. Several empty medicine paper-cups. The \"garden of stone,\" reassembled. Sayer knows better than to sit and wait, that nothing is going to immediately happen, but he sits and waits anyway. As does Miss Costello. As does Leonard and his mother.What is it?Lucy, what year is it?As real as real can be. Sidney lowers himself to his knees before Lolly and, weeping quietly, rests his head on her lap. She strokes his head.Ready?Why? What's wrong?Has someone wandered off?I've always loved tide pools, haven't you? Anthony doesn't answer. He seems troubled.What is it?, I come here all the time.I ' d thought about the opera house. Do you think they'd prefer that?The Botanical Gardens? Anthony looks to Miss Costello and rolls his eyes.y5?. Well, where else is there?What are you doing?

Then he'd be okay again.One day I came hone from work and found him in his bed, his arm like this, reaching. \"What do you want, Leonard?\" She pictures the moment in her mind, and waits, it seems, for the young Leonard to speak, to tell her what it is he wants. Finally she lowers her arm and shrugs.He read. yLeonard has Parkinson's Disease?Then what will this medicine dp. for him?What do you think it will do?What db< you hope it will do?What's here for him after all these years? 'Yes. Neither really knows what else to say except for good night. She leaves.Sidney's going.I'm your mother. Inside the bus, Miriam, anxious to leave, leans over the driver to honk the horn. Leonard kisses his mother on the cheek and turns away.Wait a minute. What on earth have you done to your hair? He's parted it, apparently, on the \"wrong\" side. She pulls a comb from her purse, recombs it \"correctly,\" straightens his jacket lapels and steps back.

Sayer nods that he's welcome.Everything.Try. Sayer smiles again. For a man who just yesterday learned he has been cheated out of the greater\"- part of his life, Leonard seems to have recovered extraordinarily.I'd like to go outside.What a wonderful place The Bronx has become.

It has been explained to me that I have been away for . . . quite some time . . . He seems to withdraw, to wrestle with the thought, to try to somehow come to terms with it, to somehow resolve it. He nods as he finds within himself some source of strength and looks directly at the camera.I'm back.He's a patient, Mom.He's still a patient. You're not a patient.There's your bus. . The public bus, behind her, coming down the street. As she hurries to the corner, Sayer climbs down off the hospital bus.I've decided not to go. He waves to his mother. Sayer stares at him.I'm staying here.Nothing. Wave. He waves again to his mother; she's boarding the public bus. Sayer does as he's told, waves too. Impatient, Miriam honks the horn again.I'll see you later, have a good time. He climbs the hospital steps and disappears inside, Sayer staring after him. Miriam honks the horn again, and he climbs aboard. The doors hiss shut and driver turns to him.No.I live here.I don't? She smiles and shakes her head 'no.1But you do.Yes. * His tone is that of someone speaking of a fact, rather than * offering an opinion. She studies him . . . and eventually: *' I receive medication. , She waits for more, but it doesn't come. Only a smile., I'm okay now.They won't be angry.Okay. They're almost to the doors.
