{"Sunset-Blvd": {"GILLIS": {"raw_line": "Yeah.That's right.What car?Why should I give you the keys?Relax, fans. The car isn't here.I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.You don't believe me? Look in the garage.You say the cutest things.It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347. The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up. But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.More or less. Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.Bases Loaded. There's a 4O-page outline.They're pretty hot about it over at Twentieth, but I think Zanuck's all wet. Can you see Ty Power as aIf I could be of any help...Exactly what kind of material do you recommend? James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?Oh, you're one of the message kids. Just a story won't do. You'd have turned down Gone With the Wind.That was last year. This year I'm trying to earn a living.Goodbye. Next time I'll write The Naked and the Dead.Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.Frankly, no.You trying to be funny? -- because I'm all out of laughs. I'm over a barrel and I need a job.Along is no good. I need it now.Any kind of assignment. Additional Dialogue.Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.Hello, Mr. Skolsky.Sure. Just sold an original for a hundred grand. The Life of the Warner Brothers. Starring the Ritz Brothers. Playing opposite the Andrew Sisters.No?How's that about your being my friend?Forget Romanoff's. It's the car I'm talking about. If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out. I thought --Look, maybe I'd better take my car --Dressed for what?Suppose you listen just for a minute -For me? Okay.I wouldn't know.Lady. you've got the wrong man.I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire. I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.Sure. Wait a minute -- haven't I seen you -- ?I know your face. You're Norma Desmond. You used to be in pictures. You used to be big.I knew there was something wrong with them.That's where the popcorn business comes in. You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.Don't get sore at me. I'm not an executive. I'm just a writer.Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.Next time I'll bring my autograph album along, or maybe a hunk of cement and ask for your footprints.Yeah?Why?I think that's what it says on my driver's license.Sure have. The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.Or teach it a better tune.Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.Uh-huh.And you'll play Salome?Only asking. I did't know you were planning a comeback.Fair enough.They'll love it in Pomona.Right now? Never let another writer read your stuff. He may steal it.I've got twenty-twenty vision.This is fascinating.Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.Sure you did. That's what makes it great. What it needs is a little more dialogue.It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.Of course not. But it ought to be organized. Just an editing job. You can find somebody.I don't know.December twenty-first.Thank you.Me? I'm busy. Just finished one script. I'm due on another assignment.You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -It's getting kind of late --The name is Gillis. I'm single.Hollywood. The Alto Nido Apart- ments.There sure is.I'll come early tomorrow.Thanks. How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.Thanks. Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.I sure turned into an interesting driveway.Hey, you -- Max -- whatever -your- name-is -- what are my things doing here?I'm talking to you. My clothes and things are up in the room.Is that so!Who said you could? Who asked you to?Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script. There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.I'll take care of that.I'm used to paying my own bills.Okay. We'll deduct it from my salary.Unpack nothing. I didn't say I was staying.Just a scene I cut out.The one where you go to the slave market. You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.Okay.I'm not here.Good.I want to talk to you for a minute.They've come for my car.I need some money right now.I've lost my car.It is to me. That's why I came to this house. That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!What's wrong with It?I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --I don't need a tuxedo.Tails. That's ridiculous.A camel's hair will do.Whose room was this?I guess this is the one you can see Catalina from. Only this isn't the day.Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.How come?What doctor?Uh-huh?Why? Her career? She got enough out of it. She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.You send them. Is that it, Max?No, I haven't. I suppose all the waxworks are coming?(Embarrassed} Please.All padding. Don't let it fool you.You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.Shouldn't we wait for the others?Not on the same floor with Valentino!It's those feathers. They tickle.It's a quarter past ten. What time are they supposed to get here?The other guests?I understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the Metropolitan and sat there listening to La Traviata, all by himself. He was afraid of catching cold.Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?A little.What's that?Stop it. You aren't going to buy me anything more.What are the notes?Norma, I can't take it. You've bought me enough.Keep it.Cut out that us business.What right do you have to take me for granted?Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --Hi, Artie.In a deep freeze.Let it ride for a while.That was the general idea.Close, but no cigar.Where's the bar?Good party.Listen, Artie, can I stick around here for a while?I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?I'll take it.Sure. Bases Loaded.Don't worry. She's just a fan for my literary output.About that luggage. Where's the phone?When youlre through with that thing, can I have it?Thanks.What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?Why, you sweet kid.Dark Windows. How did you like it?Thank you.How about the Rainbow Room?Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.I had a teacher like that once.Who wants true? Who wants moving?Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.I've got some ideas myself. One of them being this is New Year's Eve. How about living it up a little?Well....How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle. I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --Thirsting for the coolness of your lips -You'll be waiting for me?Life can be beautiful!Max? This is Mr. Gillis. I want you to do me a favor.Yes you can. I want you to get my old suitcase and I want you to throw in my old clothes -- the ones I came with, and my typewriter. I'll have somebody pick them up.What doctor? What's going on?Max ! Max !How is she?What kind of a silly thing was that to do?It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake. I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me. You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.Happy New Year.Happy New Year.You're really going to send it to De Mille?Did she read the script?I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.When did he say it, Norma?Have one of mine.Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max. I'll get you some.Give me a pack of those Turkish cigarettes -- Melachrinos.Hello, Artie. Good evening, Miss Schaefer.I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?I haven't been keeping myself at all. Not lately.Is that so? What's the wonderful news?What teacher?You did?Into what? A lampshade?O.K. Where's the cash?I was afraid of that.Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.As a matter of fact. I've given up writing altogether.Right with you.I've got to run along. Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.Sorry if I crossed you up.So long.I ran into some people I knew.Where are your...?Norma, you're smoking too much.Nothing is the matter. I'm having a great time. Show me some more.Maybe deMille is shooting.I don't think so. It's your script. It's your show. Good luck.That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.I'll be with you in a minute.Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it. It's all yours.I mean it. It's no good to me anyway. Help yourself.If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams. If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.What about all those ideas you had?Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.Check.Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...Sorry. It's your baby now.I'm all tied up. I can't.What has Artie to do with it.Good for you. You've got yourself the best guy in town.It's just impossible.Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.You're on your own. Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.And don't make it too dreary. How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes. He teaches at night. Right? They don't even know each other, but they share the same room. It's cheaper that way. As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.So do I.So long.And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.What's the matter, Max?What?How did it go?He must be quite a guy.Yes, Norma.Yes, Norma.Good night.Good.Good.I think I'll read a little.Why do you say that?I went for a walk.All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?I haven't done anything, Norma.Good.I mean this is good dialogue along in here. It'll play.Sure. Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.Constantly. No, in all serious- ness, it's really good. It's fun writing again. I'm happy here, honest I am.Who's who?Oh, that. It's from a friend of mine. A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.That's the trouble with you readers. You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.What were you -- a child actress?Second generation, huh?Nice job.Saddest thing I ever heard.Come clean, Betty. At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.May I say you smell real special.That's no shampoo. It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile. How old are you anyway?That's it -- there's nothing like being twenty-two. Now may I suggest that if we're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me ... Now back to the typewriter.What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.Sure you are. And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies. Getting herself ready for a pioture ... What happens when she finds out?You made her a star?And she's turned you into a servant.Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up! Why are you staring at me like that?What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?Why not?What is it you've heard. Come on, let's have it.Is it about me?Betty, there's no use running out on it. Let's face it, what- ever it is.From Artie. What's wrong?Why don't you? We can finish the script by Thursday.Stop crying. You're getting married. That's what you've always wanted.Why not? Don't you love Artie?What happened?That's right, Betty, ask me again. This is Joe.Or maybe it would be a better idea if you came over and saw it for yourself. The address is 10086Yes, I hear you. And I wish you'd keep still so I can hear the doorbell when she rings it.Hello, Betty.Come on in, Betty,Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos? That's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes. Careful of these tiles, they're slippery. Valentino used to dance here.You bet.Hers.Just look around. There's a lot of her spread about. If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.Want something to drink? There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.Jealous. Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal. Look at this.Her own movie theatre.I'm trying to tell you. This is an enormous place. Eight master bedrooms. A sunken tub in every bathroom. There's a bowling alley in the cellar. It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do. A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?All right. I'll give you a few more clues.All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way. Maybe it's not very admirable. Well, you and Artie can be admirable.Nobody asked you to.All right, baby. This way out.Good luck to you, Betty. You can finish that story on the way to Arizona. When you and Artie get back, if the two of you ever feel like a swim, here's the pool ...Yes, I am, Norma.Max is a good idea. He can help with my luggage. Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe. And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.That's between you and yourself, Norma.Oh. sure -- if it would make a good scene.Wake up, Norma. You'd be killing yourself to an empty house. The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.No, they don't.He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you. None of us has had the heart.You tell her, Max. Come on, do her that favor. Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.Norma, grow up. You're a woman of fifty. There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.Goodbye.

On that Bases Loaded. I covered it with a 2-page synopsis. But I wouldn't bother.It's from hunger.Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.Schaefer. Betty Schaefer. And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.I just think pictures should say a little something.Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick --Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.Hello, Mr. Gillis.Let me help you. Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.Hurt feelings department.You forgot this.I've been hoping to run into you.I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.There's one called....Window... something with a window.I didn't.Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ...Is there someplace we can talk?This is shop talk.The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving. Now why don't you use that character...Drop that attitude. Here's some- thing really worth while.I'm serious. I've got a few ideas.As for instance?We could make some paper boats and have a regatta. Or should we just turn on the shower?Are you hungry?Phillip, you're mad!No, Phillip, no. We must be strong. You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards! Furthermore, you can have the phone now.You won't. I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.With a wildly beating heart.I just got the recipe: take two packages of cough drops, dissolve in one gallon of lukewarm grape juice --Is this Crestview 5-1733? ... I'm sorry to bother you again, but I've confirmed the number. I must speak to Mr. Gillis.Where can I reach him? Maybe somebody else in the house could tell me.You don't know how glad I am to see youlStop it, Artie, will you? Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.I called your agent. I called the Screen Writers Guild. Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number. There was always somebody with an accent growling at me. You were not there. You were not to be spoken to. They never heard of you.Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.Dark Windows. I got him all hopped up about it.He thinks it could be made into something.Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck. They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.This is on the level. Sheldrake really went for it.Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.Shut up, Artie. Now if we could sit down for two weeks and get a story.I tell you this is half sold.It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal. I don't want to be a reader all my life. I want to write.You sure have.Well, for heaven's sake!Have a chair.Why should you do that?You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute. I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.See if they make sense. To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles. Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes. To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school. The first time they meet ...I'll make it short.I'm not good enough to write it alone. We'll have to do it together.Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal. Artie is out of town.We're engaged.I think so. They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end. If you want, we could work at your place.Nobody can be that busy.You're tough, all right.Honest to goodness, I hate you.Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.Came on back. Let me show you where it fits in.Oh, you --I got the funniest letter from Artie. It's rained every day since they got to Arizona. They re-wrote the whole picture for rain and shot half of it. Now the sun is out. Nobody knows when they'll get back.What's good about it? I miss him something fierce.It will?Don't you sometimes hate yourself?Who's Norma?I'm sorry. I don't usually read private cigarette cases.I'll say. This is solid gold.It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street. She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.Look at this street. All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors. I like it better than any street in the world. Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.I was born just two blocks from this studio. Right on Lemon Grove Avenue. Father was head elec- trician here till he died. Mother still works in Wardrobe.Third. Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White. I come from a picture family. Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star. So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test. Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little. I went to a doctor and had it fixed. They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.Should be. It cost three hundred dollars.Not at all. It taught me a little sense. I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...Not once. What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.If you please.It must be my new shampoo.Twenty-two.Was I? I'm sorry.Something came up. I don't want to talk about it.I just don't.It's nothing. I got a telegram from Artie.He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there. It would kind of save us a honeymoon.I don't want it now.Of course I love him. I always will. I'm just not in love with him any more.You did.What is this anyway? This is Betty Schaefer.Who are you? What do you want? What business is it of yours anyway?Joe, where are you? What's this all about?No, I'll be all right.I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.

I put him on my massage table in front of the fire. He always liked fires and poking at them with a stick.I've made up my mind we'll bury him in the garden. Any city laws against that?I don't care anyway. I want the coffin to be white. And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.Maybe red. bright flaming red. Gay. Let's make it gay.How much will it be? I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.It is not. Get out.Get out.Or shall I call my servant?I am big. It's the pictures that got small.They're dead. They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world. But that wasn't good enough. Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too. So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them. The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now? Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshlYou are! Writing words, words! You've made a rope of words and strangled this businessl But there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles, and Technicolor to photograph the red, swollen tongue!Get out!Just a minute, you!You're a writer, you said.Are you or aren't you?And you have written pictures, haven't you?I want to ask you something. Come in here.The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ. I ought to have it taken out.How long is a movie script these days? I mean, how many pages?This is to be a very important picture. I have written it myself. Took me years.It's the story or Salome. I think I'll have DeMille direct it.We've made a lot of pictures together.Who else ?I hate that word. It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man. She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils. He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.They will love it every place. Read it. Read the scene just before she has him killed!I am not afraid. Read it!Bring something to drink.I said sit down.Well?Of course it is.I wrote that with my heart.What for? I can say anything I want with my eyes.I will not have it butchered.Who? I'd have to have somebody I can trust. When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?What month?Sagittarius. I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.I want you to do this work.I don't care.I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.Oh no. I couldn't let it out of my house. You'll have to finish it here.Are you married, Mr. -- ?Where do you live?There's something wrong with your car, you said.You can stay here.Nonsense. There's room over the garage. Max will take you there...Max!I don't know why you should be so upset. Stop that playing, Max. It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.You'll like it here.You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.It's all taken care of. It's all paid for.You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters. We won't keep books. Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.Suppose you make up your mind. Do you want this job or don't you?What's that?What scene?Cut away from me?They don't? Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs? Because they want to see me, me, me! Norma Desmond.Still wonderful, isn't it? And no dialogue. We didn't need dialogue. We had faces. There just aren't any faces like that any more. Well, maybe one -- Garbo.Those idiot producers! Those imbeciles! Haven't they got any eyes? Have they forgotten what a star looks like? I'll show them. I'll be up there again. So help me!Not now, my dear. I'm playing three no trump.Please. Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.Can't you wait till I'm dummy?Please!Now what is it? Where's the fire?Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.Now you're being silly. We don't need two cars. We have a car. And not one of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit. An Isotta-Fraschini. Have you ever heard of Isotta-Fraschinis? All hand-made. Cost me twenty-eight thousand dollars.That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station. And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants. Max, what's a good men's shop in town? The very best... Well, go there !Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.There's nothing like gray flannel with a chalk stripe. This one single-breasted, of course. Now we need a topcoat. Let's see what you have in camel's hair.How about some evening clothes?Of course you do. A tuxedo and tails.You'll need them for parties. You'll need them for New Year's Eve. Where are your evening clothes?Joe, you look absolutely divine. Turn around!Come on!Perfect. Wonderful shoulders. And I love that line.Come here!I don't like those studs they've sent. I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.Cute. Let's have some drinks.Careful, it's slippery. I had it waxed.Here's to us.You know, this floor used to be wood but I had it changed. Valentino said there is nothing like tiles for a tango.Just follow me.Don't bend back like that.Who?There are no other guests. We don't want to share this night with other people. This is for you and me.Hold me tighter.You think this is all very funny.Is it funny that I'm in love with you?I'm in love with you. Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along.Don't be silly. Here. I was going to give it to you at midniglht.Read what's inside.\"Mad about the boy.\"Shut up. I'm rich. I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.What's the matter with you?What right? Do you want me to tell you?Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you. Is that it?Go away.To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.Great stars have great pride.Go away. Go to that girl of yours.Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!Happy New Year. darling.Wait a minute. I want you to get out the car. You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.This is the right day.DeMille is Leo. I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks. Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around. Let me dry you.I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me. DeMille always said I was his greatest star.So he said it quite a few years ago. So what? I never looked better in my life. Do you know why? Because I've never been as happy in my life.That idiot. He forgot to fill my cigarette case.They're awful. They make me cough.You're a darling.What on earth, darling? It took you hours.Where are my cigarettes?This is a rock.I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling? Why are you so glum?All right. Give me this. I need it for a moustache. Now close your eyes.You know better than to interrupt me.Who?Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.Certainly it's important. It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally. The idea of having an assistant call me!Say that I'm busy, and hang up.How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.I know that trick! He wants to belittle me. He's trying to get my price down. I've waited twenty years for this call. Now Mr. deMille can wait till I'm good and ready.Thank you, Max.Jonesy! Come here, Jonesy!Fine, Jonesy. Now open that gate.Thank you, Jonesy. And teach your friend some manners. Tell him without me he wouldn't have any job, because without me there wouldn't be any Paramount Studio. Go on.Don't you want to come along, darling?Thank you, darling.Hello, Mr. deMille.Last time I saw you was someplace very gay. I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.You'd better. I'm very angry.That's no excuse. You read the script, didn't you?Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.Don't play innocent. Somebody named Gordon Cole.And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.Hello.Did you see them? Did you see how they came?Nothing. I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio. I had no idea how I'd missed it.We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.It's a good script, isn't it?I don't care about the money. I just want to work again. You don't know what it means to know that you want me.But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.I'm not worried. Everything will be fine. The old team together. Nothing can stop us.It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set. Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.He'a a shrewd old fox. He can smell box office. Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e. This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.Joe darling, are you there?Don't turn around. Keep your eyes on the book.I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.I was a little worried about the line of my throat. This woman has done wonders with it.You'd better get to bed yourself.You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?I just happen to know it. I had a nightmare and I screamed for you. You weren't here. Where were you?No you didn't. You took the car.Of course not, Joe. It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain. My nerves are being torn apart. All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.Of course you haven't. I wouldn't let you.Good night, my darling.You're here, Joe ... When did you come home? Where were you? Is it a woman? I know it's a woman ... Who is she? Oh Joe, why can't I ask you? I must know, I must!Can I speak to Miss Betty Schaefer? She must be home by now.Miss Schaefer, you must forgive me for calling you so late, but I really feel it's my duty. It's about Mr. Gillis. You do know Mr. Gillis? ...Exactly how much do you know about him? Do you know where he lives? Do you know how he lives? Do you know what he lives on?Miss Schaefer, I'm trying to do you a favor. I'm trying to spare you a great deal of misery. Of course you may be too young to even suspect there are men of his sort...Don't hate me, Joe. I did it because I need you. I need you as I never needed you. Look at me. Look at my hands, look at my face, look under my eyes. How can I go back to work if I'm wasting away under this torment? You don't know what I've been through these last weeks. I got myself a revolver. You don't believe me, but I did, I did! I stood in front of that mirror, only I couldn't make myself. It wouldn't beI love you, Joe. I love you, Joe. I love you, Joe. I love you, Joe.What are you going to do, Joe?Thank you, Joe -- thank you, Joe.May I come in? I've stopped cry- ing. I'm all right again. Joe, tell me you're not cross -- tell me everything is just as it was, Joe.What are you doing, Joe? What are you doing? You're not leaving me?No, you're not. Max! Max!It's yours, Joe. I gave it to you.These are nothing. You can have anything you want if you'll only stay. What is it you want -- money?You can't do this! Max! Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.You think I made that up about the gun...See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!You don't care. do you? But hundreds of thousands of people will carelThat's a lie! They still want me!What about the studio? What about De Mille?Wanted what?That's a lie! They want me, they want me! I get letters every day!That isn't true! Max?You heard him. I'm a star!I'm the greatest star of them all.No one leaves a star. That makes one a star.You're not leaving me!You're not leaving me!You're not leaving me!Stars are ageless, aren't they?Cameras? ...What is it, Max?They have? Thank you, Max. Tell Mr. DeMille I will be on the set at once.What is the scene? Where am I?Oh, yes, yes. They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.I can't go on with the scene. I'm too happy. Do you mind, Mr. DeMille, if I say a few words? Thank you. I just want to tell you how happy I am to be back in the studio making a picture again. You don't know how much I've missed all of you. And I promise you I'll never desert you again, because after \"Salome\" we'll make another picture, and another and another. You see, this is my life. It always will be. There's nothing else - just us and the cameras and those wonderful people out there in the dark...
