Please Cassius...Aaaaah.Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.Hallelujah.I mean...tough break.Definitely.Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.Metallica, Dad. Come on.You're a good devil, Dad.Coulda been much worse.How bad?We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?So go get 'em, Dad!So go get 'em, Jimmy!You're not saying it's up to me?I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?No. This can't be happening.Okay. Earth. The Blue Marble. This doesn't look too bad.I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.I'm Nicky.I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.Okay, \"bro,\" this jig is up... Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.Oh. Sorry.It's freezing up here, Beefy.I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...So far, so good. Now what?Hey...Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!That's a pretty brassiere.Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?You got it.From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?Yes. What is rent?Off limits.No.Yeah. The deep South.I don't know.Got ya. Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.Well, let's rock and roll.Get in the bottle. Dad's falling apart. You froze the gate and you're killing him. Drink!just get in the flask!Adrian and Cassius! You think a kick to the head is gonna make me throw in the towel? Well, in the immortal words of Judas Priest, \"You got another thing comin'.\"Beast.All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.Oh nooooo....Which way did he go?Iron Maiden live double disc is simply phenomenal.Hey...Yes. I would like my flask back.No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.I don't know?It was handcrafted in hell by Satan himself and is only to be used for the capture and containment of my blood brothers so that the firefall of Hades will burn brightly once again.Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.Hey, mister. I'll be seeing you in a few years.That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.You think I'm a tourist?The South.Yeah. Deep south.I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!Uh, it's a deep south expression.It's freezing my hands.I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.School?What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?Good. I was concerned.So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.I...I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that......I've always wanted to have sex with a gross pig. What do you say we go behind that dumpster, pull our pants down and see what happens?ADRIAN!Please, get out of my mind!Hey, Valerie!Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.Adrian, please...What can I do about it?Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.But those are my roommate's sodas...Release the evil?That guy in the striped shirt snaps his fingers like someone I know...It looks like the work of a brother...If it's Cassius, yes.I'll take the shot.Release the evil.Okay, too much evil..Could I get another ball?I command you not to blow up and go into that metal circle.I know you're having fun, Cassius, but you gotta come back to Hell.Listen up, New York. Your souls are in great danger...Alright, how about this? I get one more shot. The ref will cover me. I miss it, the Globetrotters forfeit the game. I make it, he doesn't ref the second half and we all start conducting ourselves like decent human beings again.And we get free pizza.You know, Dad got very sick when you left.Never doubt my skills.Sorry, Cassius. Maybe it was the super devil juice Dad gave me. HE thought I might need it for just such an occasion.No. No way. Dad said it was only for me.Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.What's reefer?Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.All right...I'm only fifteen...thousand years old.A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.See ya, fellas.Todd. Which way to the Parson's School of Design?Coconuts...You smell like coconuts.No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.Adrian?Hey.Oh that stings! My eyes are on fire!I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.Valerie?No.I think I'm floating.I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.I can't see you but I can smell you. And you make me feel alive in a way I've never felt before.Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad......to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and...well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.Let me take care of that.Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.East Rutherford.I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead. Please tell me you like metal.My dog was right. I'm in love with you.Moo ya san jie bay!What's going on here?Ow...what was that for?Release the evil.I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.I didn't murder anybodyI was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.This is baloney!I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!I thought for sure I gave 'em the slip.Good idea...kill me.Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.That just hurt a lot.Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?I won't drink. You can't make me.Let her go.I have to, Valerie.Valerie!!!That's terrific. Now could you ladies point me to the Black Palace? I should check in with my dad...The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.My mom wasn't a goat?An angel?Wow. What...what did she look like?How come you're not older?Are you Adrian and Cassius' mom, too?I don't think so.Where did you meet my father?And that made you want to make a baby with him?Well tell her I said \"hi\" back.How did you see me?Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?Valerie's crying!I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.A speech impediment?What is it?Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa. Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.Release...the good.Release the good...Release the awesome.Put it in your mouth and let it slide down your throat-hole.Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.Okay, Adrian, you've left me with no choice.Love lifts me up where I belong.Now I'm asking you nicely, get in the flas...Oh, you wanna a pillow fight, do you?!Now will you get in the flask?Sole ruler of Hell and Earth is what I heard him keep saying.That was Cassius!From my dad's side of the family.Butterflies...I'll just go to Heaven.Sorry, Henry. Release the Evil.Do me.I love you.I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?I will, Dad.

that make the torture. You have to let people feel a sense of relief.Then again, the beauty of Dad retiring is what he says doesn't matter anymore.You sure about this decision, Dad?And he's dead serious.Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.Twenty-thousand years ago, Grandpa Lucifer said, \"It is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven.\" Well, I'm getting tired of serving in Hell. We need a place where we can rule.Could you concentrate for five seconds?What do you think about...Earth?We could create our own hell there.Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...It's our time, brother.Oh, this is delicious.Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.When an adult goes to Hell, that's terrific. But when a child goes... that's why I'm in this business.You shouldn't have come here.He's sick?He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?You know what you'll get? An indescribably horrific torture administered by demons for the rest of eternity.Sure, why not?To the defilement of Earth and the corruption of its people.It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?This liquid will probably quench my thirst. Cool me off.Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...I'm calling you out, brother...Hello, Cassius.You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.But Cassius could use some company for the rest of eternity. So get in the flask.Of course I can. Drink or she dies. Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.I hear a train coming. Drink.Ahhh!See you in Hell!Where's Nicky?I came through that gate alone.Somebody explain what's going on.Perhaps a titty twister will loosen your lips.How much time does Dad have before that happens?Thirty minutes. Hmmm. I hope you don't mind if I take a seat while I wait for you.Ten thousand years. And I never once got to sit here.Wow. And this is just a little taste of my power.Ah-ah. Not so fast, demons. There are a couple of million evil souls on Earth ready to be harvested. Anyone interested?Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.I'm very proud of you. You've taken to sin with minimal prompting.You're acting as if there is no Heaven or Hell.Well, I have some news.At the stroke of midnight, my father will be completely deteriorated. And all of your souls will be mine.Soon you will see things more horrible than you can even imagine.Not that horrible, but still pretty bad.So while we wait, for your enjoyment, I bring you a dear sweet man and an international icon...Henry Winkler!Covered in bees!You know, from this angle, you're kind of cute.Yummy.Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.Little Nicky.Is this a joke?Not bad, little brother.

And after this ten thousand years had passed, he decided to abdicate his throne......to step aside. ...and let me become the ruler of hell. This, as some of you might know, is my ten thousandth year as Prince of Darkness. So I think the time has come to discuss who will succeed me.Yes, Jimmy.No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so...so...Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be...me.The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.Right. Right. Send him in. I'm sorry, boys. I've got to get back to work.I'm telling you, pal, it's the right thing to do.Now that was an experience. \"You are only coming through in waves.\" That line blows my mind every time.I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?Who is this, Metal-lick-a?I was just playing with you.I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.Now you're talking.And I also happen to be a Jets fan.Oh, boy. Oh boy. Calm down. Get off your knees.This is bad, Nicky.I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.Everything's fine, pop.Please, pop, just go back to your room.Sure, pop. Whatever you want.To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.I'm too weak. The process has already begun.Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.Here. Get them drunk from this. One sip and they'll be trapped inside. Once you've got both of them, you bring the flask back through the gate.Son, just do your best.That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.Please, Nicky, get back up there. Try to hurry.What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...I got no ears! I can't hear!I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.I can't see shit. You're all still here, right?Boooo.Hell's gonna bust wide open. Demons, get him out of the chair!You came through, Nicky.You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting. That's right, you heard me, Holly.
