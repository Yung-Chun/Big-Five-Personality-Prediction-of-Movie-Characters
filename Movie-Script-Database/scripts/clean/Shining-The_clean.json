{"Shining-The": {"JACK": {"raw_line": "Hi, I've got an appointment with Mr. Ullman. My name is Jack Torrance.Thank you.Mr. Ullman?I'm Jack Torrance.Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.Susie, how do you do?Oh, no problem at all. I made the trip in three and a half hours.Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind. Thanks.Bill, how do you do?Pleasure to meet you.Eh - formerly a school-teacher.I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.Well, I'm looking for a change.Do you mind if I ask why you do that? It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.Well, it's certainly got plenty of that.Only in a very general way.Well, that sounds fine to me.Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for. I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh...five months of peace is just what I want.Not for me.They'll love it.I'm intrigued.I don't believe they did.Well, that is eh quite a story.Ah, I certainly can, and eh... I also understand why your people in Denver left it for you to tell me.Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.Hi, babe.Great. Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through. I don't think I can get home before nine or ten.Right it's a beautiful place. You and Danny are gonna love it.Uh...huh.Yes?Well you should have eaten your breakfast.I think that was farther west in the Sierras.There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times. They got snowbound one winter in the mountains. They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.They had to, in order to survive.See, it's okay. He saw it all on the television.No problem. In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.No, my son's discovered the games room.Right there.I'd better collect my family first.Sure is.Perfect for a child.Cosy.Well, it's very... homely.We don't drink.Mr. Halloran, I'm Jack, and this is my wife, Winifred.Danny, did you get tired of bombing the universe?Bye darling.Not at all.What time is it?Eleven thirty - Jesus!I know it.Hmm, nice.Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.Lots of ideas. No good ones.Yeah... that's all it is.I love it. I really do. I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.I fell in love with it right away. When I came up here from my interview, it was as though I had been here before. We...we all have moments of deja vu, but this was ridiculous. It was almost as though I knew what was going to be around every corner. Ooohhhhh...Fine.Yes.What do you want me to do about it?I'm not being grouchy. I just want to finish my work.Wendy, let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration.you're distracting me,and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?Fine. Now we're going to make a new rule. Whenever I am in here and you hear me typing,or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in. Now do you think you can handle that?Fine. Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?Come here for a minute, first.How's it going, Doc?Are you having a good time?Good. I want you to have a good time.Yes.No. I'm just a little tired.I can't. I have too much to do.Yes?Yes I do. I love it. Don't you?Good. I want you to like it here. I wish we could stay here for ever, and ever... ever.What?What do you mean?Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?Are you sure?I love you, Danny. I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?Good.I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had. It's the most horrible dream I ever had.I dreamed that I... that I killed you and Danny.But I didn't just kill you, I cut you up into little pieces.Oh...My God, I must be losing my mind!God, I'd give anything for a drink?My goddam soul, just a glass of beer.Hi Lloyd.A little slow tonight, isn't it?Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet. I was afraid they were going to be there until next April. So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice. You can do that, can't you, Lloyd? You're not to busy, are you?Good man.You set them up, and I'll knock them back, Lloyd, one by one.White man's burden, Lloyd my man. White man's burden.Say, Lloyd, it seems I'm temporarily light.How's my credit in this joint anyway?That's swell. I like you, Lloyd. I always liked you. You were always the best of them.Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.Here's to five miserable months on the wagon and all the irreparable harm that it's caused me.Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.No, nothing serious.Just a little problem with the... old sperm bank upstairs.Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd. Thanks.Words of wisdom, Lloyd. Words of wisdom.I haven't laid a hand on him. Goddam it, I didn't. I wouldn't touch one hair of his goddam little head. I love the little son-of-a- bitch.I'd do anything for him. Any fucking thing for him.That damn bitch.As long as I live she'll never let me forget what happened!I did hurt him once, okay? It was an accident, complete unintentional. It could have happened to anybody.And it was three goddam years ago. The little fucker had thrown all my papers all over the floor. All I tried to do was to pull him up. A momentary loss of muscular coordination. I mean... A few extra foot pounds of energy, per second... per second.Are you out of your fucking mind?Which room was it?Yes, it's me.No, nothing at all.I didn't see one goddam thing.Yes, I did.Absolutely nothing. How is he?Good.I'm sure he'll be himself again in the morning.He must have gone into that room - the door was open and the lights were on.I think he did it to himself.Wendy, once you rule out his version of what happened, there is no other explanation - is there? It wouldn't be that different from the episode that he had before we came up here, would it?Get him out of here?You mean just leave the hotel?It is so fucking typical of you to create a problem like this when I finally have a chance to accomplish something. When I'm really into my work. I could really write my own ticket if I went back to Boulder now, couldn't I?Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life so far, but I'm not going to let you fuck this up!Good evening.Hi Lloyd. I've been away. Now I'm back.It's good to be back, Lloyd.Hair of the dog that big me.That'll do her.No charge?Orders from the house.I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.Anything you say, Lloyd. Anything you say.Oh eh that's all right. I've got plenty of jackets.Advocaat is it?Looks as though you might have got a spot of it on yourself there, Jeevesy old boy.Awfully nice of you to say. Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.Here, I'll just, eh...hold this for you there, Jeevesy.Right, I'll just set my bourbon and advocaat down right there.Fine.What do they call you around here, Jeevesy?Grady?Delbert Grady.Eh, Mr. Grady...haven't I seen you somewhere before?Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?You er a married man, are you, Mr. Grady?And, er... where are they now?Mr. Grady, you were the caretaker here. I recognize you. I saw your picture in the newspapers. You eh... chopped your wife and daughters up into little bits, and eh... and you blew your brains out.No.Who?A nigger!How?Well, he is a very willful boy.It's his mother.She eh... interferes.How do you like it?How do you like it?What are you doing down here?Okay. Let's talk.What do you want to talk about?You can't remember.Maybe it was about Danny. Maybe it was about him.I think we should discuss Danny.I think... we should discuss what should be done with him.What should be done with him?I don't think that's true. I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?As soon as possible.You believe his health might be at stake?And you are concerned about him?And are you concerned about me?Of course you are.Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?Has it ever occurred to you that I have agreed to look after the Overlook Hotel until May the first? Does it matter to you at all that the owners have placed their complete confidence and trust in me, and that I have signed a letter of agreement, a contract, in which I have accepted that responsibility?Do you have the slightest idea what a moral and ethical principal is? Do you?Has it ever occurred to you what would happen to my future, if I were to fail to live up to my responsibilities?Has it ever occurred to you?Has it?Why?Why?You've had your whole fucking life to think things over - what's good a few minutes more going to do you now?I'm not going to hurt you.Wendy!Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you. You didn't let me finish my sentence. I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!' I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.I'm not going to hurt you.Stop swinging the bat.Put the bat down, Wendy.Wendy give me the bat.Give me the bat.Give me the bat.Stop swinging the bat.Give me the bat.Wendy...Give me the bat.Give me the bat.Goddamn!Hey... what are you doing?Ohhh... what are you doing?Hey, wait a minute... What are you doing?What are you doing?Hey, wait a minute!What are you doing?Open the door.Goddamit! Let me out of here! Open the goddam door.Wendy, listen. Let me out of here and I'll forget the whole goddam thing. It'll be just like nothing ever happened.Wendy, baby...I think you hurt my head real bad.I'm dizzy. I need a doctor.Honey... don't leave me in here.Wendy...Wendy...You've got a big surprise coming to you.You're not going anywhere.Go check out the Snowcat and the radio and see what I mean.Go check it out!Go check it out!Go check it out!Wendy?Grady... oh.Oh Grady... right. Grady... er...Hullo Grady.No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady. That's all I ask.For the moment, Mr. Grady. Only for the moment.There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.I give you my word.Wendy, I'm home.Come out, come out, wherever you are!Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in!Not by the hair on your chiny, chin, chin. Then I'll huff, and I'll puffand I'll blow your house in.Here's Johnny!Danny! Danny boy!Danny!Danny! Danny!Danny!Danny!Danny!Danny! I'm coming. I'm coming Dan!Danny! Danny! I'm coming!You can't get away. I'm right behind you.Danny!Danny!Danny!Danny!Danny!

"Yeah.Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.Yeah, I know. It always takes a little time to make new friends.What about Tony? He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.Oh come on, Tony. Don't be silly.Well, how come you don't want to go?Well, let's just wait and see. We're all gonna have a real good time.Hello.Hi, hon. How's it going?Sounds like you got the job?Tony is his imaginary friend.We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?Shall we go into the living room?Please...Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.But eh what was the matter with him?Oh, I'm...I'm sure you're right.Only about three months. Eh we're from Vermont. My husband was teaching school there.Tony.No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.No. He didn't like it too much at first, and then he had an injury, so we kept him out for a while, and, yeah, I...I guess that's about the time when I first noticed that he was talking to Tony.Ah he dislocated his shoulder.Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night. And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.Anyway, something good did come out of it all because he said:\"Wendy, I'm never gonna touch another drop and if I do you can leave me\", and he didn't and he hasn't had any alcohol in eh five months.Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?Jack...Oh, it's beautiful. My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?God, I've never seen anything like this before. Are all of these Indian designs authentic?Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.Royalty?Oh!Yeah.Yeah.When was the Overlook built?Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.Oh, I'll say.Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?Nice to meet you.Oh it's just wonderful.Hi Danny!Danny, come on over here.Thanks.Great. See you later, hon.I'm a Wendy.God. This is the kitchen, huh?Yeah. This whole place is such an enormous maze, I feel I'll have to leave a trail of breadcrumbs every time I come in.I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.Mr. Halloran,how did you know we called him 'Doc'?Doc. You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.Yeah. We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons. But how did you know that?Well, it's possible, but I honestly don't remember calling him that since we've been with you.Hi.No, we don't mind.Sound good to you, Danny?Okay. You behave yourself.It's amazing how much activity is going on today.Just like a ghost ship, huh?Good Morning, hon. Your breakfast is ready.It's about eleven thirty.I guess we've been staying up too late.I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.It's really pretty outside. How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?Any ideas yet?Well, something'll come. It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.It's really nice up here, isn't it?Yeah. It's amazing how fast you get used to such a big place. I tell you, when we first came up here, I thought it was kinda scarey.The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?And you're gonna lose. And I'm gonna get you - you betta run fast! Look out - I'm coming in close. All right?Okay Danny, you win. Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?Give me your hand. Oh, isn't it beautiful.Here's a dead end.Oh what a Maze. Isn't it beautiful.It's so pretty.I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?Hi, hon. How's it going?Get a lot written today?Hey, the weather forecast said it's going to snow tonight.Ah, come on hon. Don't be so grouchy.Okay. I understand. I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.Yes.Yes.Okay.I know you've got some.Oh no!I knew it!This is KDK 12 calling KDK 1.KDK 12 to KDK 1.Hi. This is Wendy Torrance at the Overlook Hotel.Oh we're just fine, but our telephones don't seem to be doing too well. Are the lines down by any chance? Over.Any chance of them being repaired soon? Over.Boy, this storm is really something, isn't it? Over.I suppose not. Over.Okay. We'll do that. It was real nice talking to you. Bye. Over and Out.Yes?Not right now, Daddy's asleep.Come on, Doc. He only went to bed a few hours ago. Can't you wait till later?Well all right. But really don't make a sound.Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?Jack...Jack... Jack...Jack, honey, what's wrong?What happened, honey? Hon? What's wrong? Jack!It's okay. It's okay, now. Really.Every...everything is just going to be all right. Come on. Here let's get up off the floor.Danny! Everything's okay... Just go play in your room for a while. Your Dad's just got a headache. Danny - mind what I say. Go play in your room!Hon, let me just go and get him out of here. I'll be right back.Danny, why don't you mind me - huh? Danny.Oh my God! Danny what happened to your neck? Danny...what happened to your neck, huh?You did this to him, didn't you?You son of a bitch! You did this to him,didn't you?How could you? How could you?Jack...Oh Jack! Thank God you're here.Jack, Jack, there's someone else in the hotel with us. There's a crazy woman in one of the rooms. She tried to strangle Danny.No. It's the truth, really. I swear it. Danny told me. He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub. She tried to strangle him.Jack?Oh, thank God!Did you find anything?You went into the room Danny said - to 237?And you didn't see anything at all?He's still asleep.Well, are you sure it was the right room? I mean, maybe Danny made a mistake?Oh, I just don't understand.Well what about those bruises on his neck?Somebody did that to him.No! No, that's not possible.Jack, whatever the explanation is,I think we have to get Danny out of here.Yes.Yes.Jack...We have the Snowcat. If the weather breaks, we might just be able to get down the mountain in that.I could call the Forest Rangers first and then tell them that we're coming so that they could start searching for us, in case we didn't make it.If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves. That's all there is to it.Danny?Danny... what's the matter, hon?Are you having a bad dream?Danny? Hon?Come on, hon, wake up. You just had a bad dream. Everything's okay.Danny, wake up! Come on, right now,Wake up.Danny...Hon,...listen to me for a minute, will you, hon?I'm just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes and I'll be right back. I want you to just stay here and watch your cartoons, okay?Okay, hon?All right. Now I'll be back in just about five minutes. I'm gonna lock the door behind me.Jack...?Jack...?Jack!I just eh... wanted......to talk to you.I...I can't really remember.No, I can't.I don't know.Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.Yes...As soon as possible?Jack......please...Ye...yes.Yes.Of course I am.Oh Jack, what are you talking about?Stay away from me!I just want to go back to my room.Well... I'm very confused, and I just need a chance to think things over.Jack... stay away from me... please.Don't hurt me! Don't hurt me!Stay away from me,Stay away...!Stay away from me!Stay away from me!Stay away from me!Stay away from me! Please...Stay away from me.Stop it!Stay... stay away!Stay away from me.Jack, stay away from me!Get down.Go away from me.Go away.Go away.Oh...oh!I'm gonna go now -I'm going to try and get... get Danny down to the Sidewinder... in the Snowcat today.I'll bring back a doctor.I'm gonna go now.Yes?Danny.
