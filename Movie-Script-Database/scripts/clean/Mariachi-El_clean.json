{"Mariachi-El": {"DOMINO": {"raw_line": "What happened to you, Mariachi? Too much refresco?Is it true?Domino.Thieves?So why do you come here? You want to get me killed?And you've never seen them before? Not even in another town?Maybe they hate your music.Maybe you were singing in another town, they hated your voice, and now they're trying to kill you.Yes.I have a room upstairs. My room. Don't touch anything. I'll be up after awhile and we can call a friend of mine.This way.What happened?This is a border town. I get strangers all the time.No.Aren't you gonna call your boss?Que pasoMaybe he loves his guitar. It's probably an antique.I thought I told you not to touch anything.No, it's alright, Finish up. Do you want shampoo?Who are you?!What do you have in here? GUNS? KNIVES?We'll see...You're very modest, Mariachi...You told me you killed four men, when you really killed seven. Or were they still breathing even after you shot out their hearts?Aren't you going to watch?Play it.Play it, damnit, play something sweet!!!You're a mariachi, all right. And a good one.I couldn't pay you. I have no money.It's the truth.Will I have to keep a knife at your balls to get you to play like that?You won't find a permanent job in this town... but OK.You're going to need a better sense of humor than that, if you're gonna work for me, kid.Are you crazy? If you go anywhere with that jacket and that case you could be killed. Leave that stuff here.Hi. It's Domino.Did he say anything?Look, as long as you don't carry the case around, they'll leave you alone. It's that guy they're after.What's wrong?I was on the phone, talking to a friend that knows what's going on.No... He told me the man in black is Azul.I don't know... Anyway, he's killing the men of the town drug dealer. The dealer's name is Mauricio. But he's known as Moco.They have never seen Azul... only Moco knows him. My friend says the description Moco gave his men was that he wears black, and carries a guitar case. Sounds like you, no?Only special people can talk to Moco. Besides, you've killed a few of his men, now. Your best option is to keep out of sight, stop wearing black, and to hide that stupid case until this is all over.Mondays are my day off. Want to play a game?Hello?I can't.I don't feel well. I've got to go.No... I've got to go...No...This place is a gift.From Mauricio.He's not trying to kill you, his man had you confused with Azul.Look, you now how if you want to impress a girl, you send her flowers, candy, jewelry until you win her love?If one present doesn't work, you keep sending bigger and better things until you win her or you're broke?Well, Mauricio sent me flowers, then jewelry, then he gave me a job at his saloon, then he gave me the whole saloon... etc.He'll never run out of money.A motorcycle.He wants me to ride out to his ranch when I've decided to be his. He thinks he's close to having me.He was.Not anymore.I remember when I was growing up, we were so poor, that my brothers and sisters and I all slept on the same blanket stretched out across the floor. We had to sleep in a circle, with our fingers in each other's ears, to keep the bugs from crawling into them.Here's a little bit I've saved. I want you to go get a new guitar.Take it, stupid. I'm not saying go by the best one, just a temporary one so you can play again tonight.What can I get you?Anything else?Where's Mariachi?Upstairs.Why will you help me?Let's go.Mauricio!!What have you done with Mariachi?The musician your men confused with Azul.I never asked you for anything until now.
