The Shadow knows. . .Of course ... of course ... if I had known the panic the broadcast was causing -- well I would have stopped! I never meant for any of this to happen and I feel just horrible!I'll tell you what, this is the best electric train set a boy ever had!All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--NonsenseForget it-Telling stories.Showing lifeMagicNot for me.That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.Here, turn around.So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.We find the man and then we dissect him-But with compassion and insight--How do you do, Mr. Hearst? My name is Orson Welles.How about Howard Hughes? We could do HughesHoward Hughes killed Jean Harlow?Sigmund Freud?Manolete?!The great Spanish bullfighterNo, it's perfect! When in doubt, put on a cape! False noses and faux beards and flowing capes have been the life-blood of the actor's craft since the days of lrving and Booth. Imagine me in a glittering suit of lights on the dusky Andalusian plains--Bullfighting, Miss Davies!My factotum, ally and comrade-in-armsEver met Walter Winchell?No, when I was but a tender lad--My father and I made a tour of the grand boulevards of antique Europe. And when we were in Iberia I had the chance to face the bulls. At the knee of the great Manolete I took up the cape and sword - -- across from me stood a mammoth bull reputed to have gored a full seven men to a grisly demise! So - - with Manolete shouting encouragement I flourished . . . I flourished again . . . and the bull charged! Across the golden dust it came, thundering like the great minotaur of legend, closer, ever closer, its calamitous hooves pounding into the dirt, shaking the earth as I held the crimson eye of the bull with my own, defying it -- it was almost upon me and I flourished one last time! -- the monster swept past! -- and my sword was gone -- buried in the bloody eye of the beast!In Spain the cruelty would be in denying the beast a fighting end.My name is Orson WellesAnd director.To make pictures.None.So I've been told.I'll remember that.The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.He's nothing but a hypocrite. He preaches morality every day in his sordid little papers for everyone else in the world but he lives openly with his mistress.Look at those hands.

It came to me like a thief in the night! Pure inspiration! Total magnificence!I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--Yes.Mank-How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--We're doing Hearst.So speaks the court jester.I expected more from you.How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight--Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years----Because he has been so furiously busy wasting himself. Amusing his keepers. Because he is a sycophant! Because he has been thrown out of every studio in Hollywood and no one will hire him because he's a drunk- -!Listen to me-I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!It doesn't have to beI'll hire you -- right now-NOT UNLESS I. TELL YOU IT ISLook, Mank, this is our only chanceThen let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?Take my hand, Mank. And we'll dance one last time. We'll dance to the music of the angels. We'll make history. We'll scorch the earth. We will ... astonish them all.So, who is he? We have to know him.How?The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.Why her?All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because those are the only conditions he has ever known.Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.... And I said, \"Mr. Toland, you are the finest cinematographer in Hollywood, why would you desire to work with a stumbling neophyte?\"And he replied, \"Mr. Welles, the only way to learn anything new is to work with someone who doesn't know a damn thing.\"Hedda, this movie is going to look like no other picture ever made.Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?What we are going to do is shoot life -- in all it's joyous complexity.Consider this quarter, my dear. You can touch it and feel it and were you to lean forward you could even smell it. Why is it that in the movies a simple bit of reality -- a quarter, a room, a man--Becomes nothing but a lie? A trick. An illusion.I will show the reality behind the trick.I will use the illusions of Hollywood to show . . . the truth.And so the dreamer awakens into the realms of reality. He has been given a rendition of the truth. He has been treated with respect.We're using-Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--I am not doing Hearst.It's 350 pages long.It is 350 pages of ... ABSOLUTE INSPIRATION!Housey, get us a drink.I told you you could do this! How could you have ever doubted me!? You must never doubt me again!Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about \"Kane\" -- you like that?K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane IBut it's not a great syllableTo my invaluable comrade Drink up!Jesus Christ --Get away from me--It's obviously a mistake, Manki Some steno girl made a mistake, alright?!I fucking well can! I own your script and I can do anything I goddamn want. And don't forget for one minute that I took your 350 pages of drunken rambling and I made a movie out of them -- and now I've got to shoot the bastard. So thank you very much, I have all I need. And you can stop calling me.It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice, grand ring to it -- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid, Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--Pardon?A \"Z\" and a \"K\" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a \"Z\" and a \"P\" and that worked--I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!JesusPlease don't ask me to do this.George, I want you to let me make this movie because I need to make it. And I don't really knowIt's your decision, George. If you look into my eyes right now and say, go make WAR OF THE WORLDS, I will. I'll make it. And, yes, it'll make you money.Ah, it's a grand title.Today we - -Today we are going to break every rule in motion picture history...We're going to do this because it's going to be fun.Again.Again.AgainIt needs a ceiling, Gregg. Real rooms have real ceilings.You bet.No, it's gonna be impossible. That's why we're doing it.AgainAgainWell, that didn't really workIt is the most important line of the picture. You will weave the magic of \"Rosebud\" in a single word - - you will say the word in such a way as to impart to us the mystery of it. It is a divine and sinister mystery worthy only of your talent. In this one word the movie soars or falls. Once more, I beg you.Actors.STOP EVERYBODY STOP!YOU COME DOWN HERE!GET OUTNo -- no -- I'll pour the tea. Sorry. I should pour the tea. Let's try that again.Okay, here we go... Set. ActionNo -- that's not rightUrn. . . ah . . . yes -- you should definitely pour the tea. Okay, again. Sorry.... Set. Action.Five...? Yes. No. We're done todayAnd I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. 'I just can't . . see it anymoreI want you backI'm sorry.This is the shooting script we've been using every day.It's just like we always said it would beDid I ever tell you about my father?He was a drunk. And he was my father and I was ashamed of him.He showed me the world, he took me with him everywhere -- Europe, China -- and he was so proud of me. But he would drink and he would get ...embarrassing. And I began to resent him Because I was so ... sparkling, you see.When I finally saw him again, he was in a coffin. I was fifteen. And all of a sudden he wasn't that embarrassing drunk anymore ... he was the man who showed me the world.Just like you, Mank.YeahOkayCan you see my shoes?Goddamn it Joe -- stand hereIt's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--Come on, Gregg! We'll tear out this floor!Get me a jackhammer.\"Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me.\"Keep filming.Then make them up! You're drunk and you're angry.This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him--\"A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own.\"Cut. PrintHow 'bout a real drink?Yeah.It's finished.Good morning, good morning. . .This is an abomination There's no music and--The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!What the hell did that mean?!Give me one dinner with her and I'll sort it out. Woman of a certain age are woefully susceptible to a younger man's charm. I'll make myself so monumentally attractive thatThe ad..We open on Monument Valley. Those towering stalagmites reaching up like pleading fingers to God. A single figure treads the arid plains. The crimson sun is behind him so his shadow stretches toward us. He is a simple man wearing a simple robe. A profoundly quiet and sad man. Who is he?Who is he, Gregg?Yes!I'm ChristYes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--Sorry, you keep at it, old boy.No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A \"puny upstart\" or a \"spoiled dilettante\" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell thatWell, at least she's off KANE todayHedy Lamarr?So they're Jews. . .Christ.What does this have to do with--?What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!It's too late. The movie's madeYou wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!I WILL NOT MOVE ON! Let them do their worst! These petty tyrants! These monstrous, small men Do they think they can stop us? I Who are they?! Who are they?! THEY ARE . .. ACCOUNTANTS IThen find another theaterThen we'll open it in Detroit or Dallas or Kalamazoo for God's sake! We'll show it in goddamn circus tents and--!\"Do what you can\"?! That's not good enough IYou're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!Why don't you just have the guts to admit itIt's just that my movie is so-That soulless monster gets no tears from me.It's ... sad\"I'll buy everything I wear at Saks.

People are sick to death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.You're a laugh-riot, kid.Right-Like a bug.Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean HarlowSure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over UtahKid, you just got your ass kicked on Joseph Conrad and now you're gonna go to Schaefer and tell him you wanna do the id and the superego?

Think about it, pal. Every day one out of five Americans picks up a Hearst publication. 30 newspapers, a dozen magazines, a bunch of radio stations and the grand dragon of them all. Little Miss Louella Parsons. Tends to give you some of that ol' noblesse oblige.No, baby, those are the hands of a killerThe whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.Yeah, it's the place God would have built, if he'd had the money.You've been naughty, haven't you, honey?Sorry.Orson, please ... it's too brightOkay, boy wonder, what?Oh for Christ's sake-This better be goodOh Christ...Oh ChristPlease don't say this.Don't whisper it.

Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.You may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.Fuck youSorry to disappoint.It feels just fine, you pompous fuck-Don't do thisDon't do thisAND YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A GODDAMN PHONY! What is all this \"Orson Welles\" bullshit?! This boy genius crap?! What the fuck did you ever CREATE? You're just another goddamn ACTOR!Let me out.Fuck you--I don't have it anymore?!When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ... great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--He'll destroy us.Thank God you don't write dialogueEveryone sees someone different. That's what we show.Like a jewel.

Okay, you're dying - what do you think?Something you lost maybe?Something you can never get back?They don't have to.And what does he see?And when he looks up? What does he dream about?I'm ready to write it, OrsonLeiand: \"You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. But you don't really care about anything except you.\" Craig: \"A toast then, Jedediah, to all those people who didn't vote for me today and to love on my own terms.

I'm out.I don't care.Too late, kid.I don't give a shit about-There but for the grace of God, goes God.Hey, kid. Gregg.No, you gotta hear this-You read Louella?\"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?\"No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. \"Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees\" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about?Jews. She's talking about Jews.Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word \"Jew\" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating.This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.Let me tell you a story, son So this was 1924, right? Hearst was throwing a birthday party for Thomas Ince, the old movie producer. They were all on the old man's yacht taking a nice jaunt from Pedro down to San Diego. Real foggy night it was. This was Hearst, Marion, Ince, Charlie Chaplin, Louella, the usual gorillas. So Hearst notices Marion slip off with Chaplin -- she was screwing everyone then -- and the old man goes nuts. Grabs his revolver and starts shooting. Just like Tom Mix, standing there blasting away through the fog. Boom - - boom -- boom -- and Thomas Ince takes a bullet through the head. So now there's this dead guy lying on the deck. You'll see how this could be quite an embarrassment. So the empire goes into action. Nice and quiet and Ince was cremated lickety-split. No inquest and no police. It was right after this that Hearst gives Louella her life-time contract. Just to keep her all hush-hush.If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already.They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--I told you this was going to happen! I told you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we lost. That's how it goes, okay? I got my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.Hope he's planning to start with the crucifixion.... and Rita Hayworth says: \"You see, he truly was the Son of God\" ... big Toland lighting effect ... blah, blah, blah ...Sure, kid, come in. I'm writing the crucifixion and it's a bitch. Sit downYou guys after Orson too?ShootShit, Orson's no pink.

of all his sadism -- none is more depraved than cruelty to animals.Who are you, sir?The actorI see. And you are in California for what reason?And what pictures have you made?Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.There you are, honey. Aren't you a wonderful girl?There's no call for that language-Darling, I talked to Millicent.She said noShe's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.I'm so sorry.How so?Yes?So my life is a subject for mockery. All of it. Every detail. Every personal detail.Thank you for your timeMiss Parsons, I have one additional question for you.Why did we not know about this sooner?I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.Please be quiet.And how do you feel when you are lied to?Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from this day forth. It shall nourish us bothLouisHope you don't mind my popping in--What a wretched place this is. I can't come to town without feeling filthy. You really must buy that parcel of land by the castle and come north.Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?I can't see how the release of that picture will do anyone any good, really.Say, while I'm in town why don't we play 18 holes at Bel Air? Or maybe just nine. Do you have time for a round today?And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.Oh, why is that?Why is that, Louis?Oh, that's right. How silly of me to have forgotten. I sometimes forget that you're all Jews. Lots of people forget that. If they ever knew it.See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?And you'll come out to the castle soon, I hope Marion and I would love to see more of you.The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.Thank you, Joseph.Nothing for you to worry about, darlingThe S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on the debts.It's not really--125 million.Yes.One . . . buys things.Switch it off SWITCH IT OFFWould everyone please leaveMarion--This picture--And now of all times -- NOW -- when I am grasping on with my fingernails to live at all this Orson We lies -- this insect -- this reprehensible insect -- has the nerve TO CHALLENGE ME! To show my life as some cheap sideshow -- A FREAK SHOW -- A DYING, IMPOTENT OLD FREAK IN HIS CASTLE!Mr. Willicombe -- you have seen me in adversity -- you have seen me take on the unions and the Congress and the railroads -- and we have risen above -- we have risen above. And if that dog Welles thinks he can strike at me now -- when he thinks I'm weak when he thinks I'm vulnerable -- then he does not fully comprehend the man is facing.Get me Louella Parsons, now!This upstart -- this puny man -- how does he even dare to imagine he could comprehend my life and my world when he crawls with the other insects in the sewer -- in the dung -- when we control every moment of his life from the instant he is born to the instant we decide that he will die! Does he have no idea of the power that controls him?!Miss Parsons, Mr. Hearst. Use the fileNow get me J. Edgar HooverThen wake him up!That insect thinks he knows me! He thinks he knows my capabilities! When his neck is in my teeth and his blood is in my throat then he will know WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST!I've been thinking about the Tribune in Chicago. The Examiner just can't make any headway. Circulation is still down. I think we should buy the Tribune.There's nothing to explainI will not defend my life to you--We are in no \"pickle\" -- as you would euphemistically have it.There is nothing to discuss-You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.You needn't use that language with meI wanted itNot for me.That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.You are repellant when you drink.You are slovenly and unattractive and I won't t-t-t-tolerate it.I will not have this in my home.No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculouscastle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--There is nothing to understand but this: I am a man who could have been great, but was not.I'll have to sell the animals.When will it come out? When will the public know?Ah, Miss Davies, the times we have seenI can't sell this. How much are they asking?Yes, I think I shall.I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles? What kind of sad future are we two making? A future where men will do anything to sell their newspapers and their movies? A future where no price is too high for fame and power? When we will all scratch each other to pieces just to be heard?", "clean_line": "sweet little thingsyou evidently man knows great deal bull man malignity sadism depraved cruelty animals sir actori california reason pictures wish luck treacherous business hollywood fiercest bulls brutally killed honey aren wonderful girl language darling talked millicent said noshe catholic says soul peril divorce sin apparently sorry yes life subject mockery personal thank timemiss parsons additional question know sooner pay good deal money eyes ears hollywood provide simple service use quiet feel lied good retain feeling let nourish day forth shall nourish bothlouishope mind popping wretched place come town feeling filthy buy parcel land castle come north came visit heard citizen kane picture mm good picture told apparently details exploits publisher like entirely like follow far release picture good town play holes bel air maybe time round today maybe mr warner mr goldwyn mr cohn mr selznick play oh louis oh right silly forgotten forget jews lots people forget knew citizen kane picture won ll come castle soon hope marion love journal pretty harsh roosevelt today bolshevik war end year think going run wheelchair picture thank joseph worry darlingthe turned request relief debts million yes buys things switch switch offwould leavemarion picture times grasping fingernails live orson lies insect reprehensible insect nerve challenge life cheap sideshow freak dying impotent old freak castle mr willicombe seen adversity seen unions congress railroads risen risen dog welles thinks strike thinks weak thinks vulnerable fully comprehend man facing louella parsons upstart puny man dare imagine comprehend life world crawls insects sewer dung control moment life instant born instant decide die idea power controls miss parsons mr hearst use filenow edgar hooverthen wake insect thinks knows thinks knows capabilities neck teeth blood throat know william randolph hearst ve thinking tribune chicago examiner headway circulation think buy tribune explaini defend life pickle euphemistically discuss typically theatrical marion need tribune th century deauville france needn use language mei wanted itnot right ve captured exactly goodnight repellant drink slovenly unattractive won tolerate home want condemn like want point pathetic old man grown lunatic spending trapped ridiculouscastle fighting old battles win pulitzer roosevelt hollywood understand man great ll sell animals come public know ah miss davies times seeni sell asking yes think shall wonder idea intimately sin placed head swimming blood entire life retain belief think old fashioned undoubtedly believe private lives public property leave mr welles kind sad future making future men sell newspapers movies future price high fame power scratch pieces heard"}}}
