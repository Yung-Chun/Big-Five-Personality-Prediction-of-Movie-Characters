{"One-Flew-Over-the-Cuckoos-Nest": {"BIG NURSE": {"raw_line": "Good morning, boys.Mean old Monday, Miss Pilbow, mean old Monday... Good morning, boys. Rise and shine. Rise and shine.Time to get up! Come on now, it's a beautiful day! Let's not straggle! Everybody up, up, up!Good morning, Mister Sefelt... Good morning, Mister Fredrickson. Good morning, Billy, I spoke to your mother last night and she sends her love... Good morning, Mister Harding... Good morning, Mister Cheswick. Mister Scanlon...Oh, Mister Bromden... Mister Washington!Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.Mister McMurphy!Will you come with me, please.My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.Mister Miller, this is Mister McMurphy, who'll be staying with us.We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.This is your bed. You may leave your things in that cabinet.Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.Good. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington, he'll see that you're properly oriented.Is there anything else?Good. I'm sure we'll be friends.Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.Somebody please see to Mister Bancini, so we can start the meeting.At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife... Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.' So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further?Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!Yes... We were discussing Mister Harding's problem with his wife. Now, who will start? Billy.Would you like to start?Mister Sefelt?Mister Fredrickson?Mister Taber?Mister Martini?Mister Scanlon?Mister Cheswick?Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter? Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.But you have no proof.And yet you suspect her.Why?Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?Yes, Billy?No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...Somebody see to Mister Bancini.Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.Yes, Mister McMurphy?That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.Not at all, Mister McMurphy...That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...Good morning, boys. Rise and shine. Rise and shine.Time to got up! Come on now, it's a beautiful day! Let's not straggle! Everybody up, up, up!Good morning, Mister Sefelt, are your teeth any better?... Good morning, Mister Fredrickson... Good morning, Mister Harding; my, my, you've been biting your fingernails again...Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.On this ward?Oh, I had them removed.Patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day.Mister Washington!Please see to Mister Bromden.Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast... You too, Mister McMurphy.After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.Sit down, Mister Cheswick.Sit down, Mister Cheswick!You should have thought about that before you gambled all your cigarettes away. Is that clear?Mister Cheswick, is that clear!Good... Now, as I recall, we were making quite a bit of headway, last time, with Mister Harding's problem. So, does anyone care to begin?Yes, Mister McMurphy.Certainly, Mister McMurphy.The point is well taken, Doctor, but do we have the necessary personnel to cover a second day room?Good. Good. Yes, yes, I think we should give it a trial period. So! May we get back to Mister Harding's problem... Yes, Mister McMurphy?Go on...Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.Very well! All those in favor, please raise your hands.I count only two, including you, Mister McMurphy. Certainly not enough to change ward policy.Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?Then I suggest we turn our attention back to Mister Harding's problem. Would anybody care to begin?Yes, Mister Harding?Try, Billy, try...Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?Tell us about it...What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it? You must try to talk about it, Billy.Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?Will one more vote satisfy you?Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?A vote is before the group.Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!Sit down, Mister McMurphy!I want you to turn the television off and return to your place!Sit down, Mister Cheswick.I want you men to return to your proper places. The group meeting is not over!Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...You men remain seated!You boys, stop this and go to your assignments! Mister McMurphy, I want you to set an example...Good. Well, boys, did you enjoy yourselves?My, my...Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!No, it was irresponsible!That's quite a catch, Jim. Whaat are you going to do with it?That's an excellent idea. Now, why don't you boys place your fish on the gurney and we'll see to it that everyone enjoys a fresh fish dinner.Thank you, boys. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington to the showers, supper is in half an hour.It's been brought to my attention that you're giving Mister Fredrickson your medication, aren't you, Mister Sefelt?Now, Jim, you must be honest with yourself.Yes, Mister Fredrickson?Sit down, Mister Cheswick, and wait your turn!If the dorms were left open, you would just return to bed after breakfast...With few exceptions, time spent in the company of others is therapeutic, while every minute spent brooding alone only increases separation.Mister McMurphy.Welcome back.I hope everything is settled.Good. Why don't you join us?Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.No.No, miss, it's the other way around.Who?Miss, it's a complicated case. It would take too long to explain.Billy, it's not polite to stare!Thank you, Mister Washington! Mister McMurphy, do you know where Billy is?Mister Harding, have you seen Billy?Mister Sefelt...You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...Who? Tell me!Get up, Billy.Mister Washington.Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!Washington! Warren! To the day room, immediately!Get away from him! Don't you dare touch him!Did everything go well, Mister Sefelt?That's very nice. Now, doesn't that make you feel better, Mister Sefelt?Good...Yes, Mister Harding?No. Mister Harding, that is not true.Thank you...Now, let's find you a place to sit, shall we, Mister McMurphy?Here now, you sit here... That's it...", "clean_line": "good morning boys mean old monday miss pilbow mean old monday good morning boys rise shine rise shine time come beautiful day let straggle everybody good morning mister

ma'am...I tell ya, these goons showered me at the courthouse this morning, last night at the jail, and I swear they'd have swabbed my ears out on the way over if they could've found the facilities...Hey, how ya doin', cutie?Just great! See ya around!Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.Yeah, I'm here on a ninety-day observation period. Short-timer, like they say...After you, ma'am.Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing, Doc...Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.Fish! Hell, Doc, I'd like to have a nickel for every fish I landed between Point Conception and the Alaska coast...Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.You bet, Doc.Thank you, ma'am,Hi.How ya doin', buddy?Oh, yeah? What's ailing ya?Well, that's too bad...Yeah, buddy?No, 'fraid not...Yeah, buddy?Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta change...Sure...Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?That right?Your buddy is callin' ya.What's troubling ya, buddy?You look pretty healthy to me.How do ya know that?You're breathin' right now.What's that, Pop?Can't hear ya, old-timer.Hell, compared to where I just come from, this is a country club.Whatcha boys playin'?Shoot!

Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure...Well, ya know, Doc... Doesn't it say so there?I don't, Doc...That's correct, Doc ...Doc, what can I tell ya?No, this is my first trip, Doc.You bet, Doc!Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck?Ah, come off it! It's that Big Nurse, that's who...I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!Did to you and all the rest of you guys.What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.Tell 'er to go straight to hell!She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.She's peckin' at your balls, buddy, at your ever-lovin' balls.P.A.

I'll take your marker. How many ya want?'Kay, all bets are down, let's wheel 'em an' deal 'em.Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say?

Sorry 'bout that...Sorry to have bothered you.What's the horse pill for, honey?Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!I'm not upset. All I wanna know, for the lovva Jesus...No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes.You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card?Chief? I wanna ask ya somethin'. Oh, does the spearmint lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight? When you chew it in the morning, will it be too hard to bite? This question's got me goin', won't somebody set me right; does the spearmint lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight?Here ya go, Chief...What the... Who the fuck stole my cigarettes!I wanna report a robbery!Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!What for?Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!'Kay, let's go brush our teeth, fellas...Oh, Lulu had a baby, His name was Sunny Jim, She put 'im in a piss pot, To teach 'im how to swim. Oh, he swam to the bottom, He swam to the top, Lulu got excited, An' pulled 'im by his... Cock-tail ginger-ale, Five cents a glass, An' if ya don't like it Ya can shove it up your... Ask me no more questions, I'll tell ya no more lies.What's wrong with you guys?Why, if I'd have known how soft this place was gonna be, I'd have arranged for my transfer sooner... Look at this here, real orange juice! Hooee, that's good. Why, you couldn't pay me to leave this place! All this place lacks is a couple of sweet gals to liven things up...Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?Asshole.Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.Right!'Kay... Item one... I've been thinkin' 'bout the age problem we got on this ward. You know, the young an' old livin' together, an' I was thinkin' what a great thing it would be if the music was turned up louder. Louder so the old fellas could hear better...But then I got to thinkin', the music is so loud already, it makes it difficult for the young fellas to hold a decent conversation...Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?I'm not finished yet.'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.Yeah?The hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. What I want is a vote on it right now!Atta boy, Cheswick!Okay, raise your hands.Come on', what is this crap? Who wants to watch the World Series?No way.You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.Snake eyes! Hoooeee, that puts you on my Marvin Gardens, which means you owe me three hundred and fifty dollars.You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon.Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote!It is to me! An' if I hafta bust way outta this place to see it, I will!Yeah!Yeah, how much you wanna bet?That me an' my buddy, Cheswick, we'll be downtown tomorrow watchin' the ballgame while you suckers are sittin' around this goddamn nursery!That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.You think it's funny, huh?Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!All right!With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!You're fuckin' A-right, I am!You heard me the first time!You're on!Stand aside, son. Any more takers?Right!Okay.

I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.That's it! We made it!So do I!You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch...Well, screw that noise!Hoo-wee!

Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.Ya like that, Chief, huh?Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...Shhh, Chief, don't talk. Never talk! Remember, this is just between you an' me.

Martini!Martini, throw a card!No, throw a club!Don't you have any clubs?Let me see your hand!Well, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have some pressing matters to attend to.Yes, that's perfectly correct.Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.No, Miss Ratched...Yes, that is correct.I can only speculate as to the reasons why.Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.The point is, I will carry on until I fully understand what the function of that relationship is regardless of form or content.That's a matter of opinion.Is that your sense of humor or are you trying to say something?I don't know. I don't know, but it makes me feel very peculiar when you throw in something like that.I hesitate to go on.I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...... or making me aware of a condition in my life, then I say, categorically speaking, the hell with you, Taber! I don't have to justify the condition of my life to you or any of you. No matter what I will carry on until I fully understand what that function is regardless of the form or content. Regardless of the fact we must try to understand the function of our capacity to obtain, to personify the condition, the condition of our existence, our existence...A pecking party?It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.Did to me?Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.Lobotomy!That!Now, what would I be trying to say?Why didn't you tell her to go to hell, lover boy?I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady.Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function... Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...To reflect...A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?With your own two hands?Twenty-five dollars.Okay, sucker.Giving up?Leave him alone, he's pouting.He can't hear you!So why are you talking to him?It doesn't help him.Well, I think you're just confusing him...What for?That's nice. Send me a post card.No!I'm not running a charity ward...What's your plan, Mack?What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!Pass the ball! Pass it! Pass it! Pass it! I'm open, McMurphy, pass the ball!Mack, get back here!I refuse!No!I just started!I don't trust you!McMurphy, pass the ball!Sure, Mack...Okay, suckers, place your bets...Big Ace... a lovely lady... another ace... an' a little trey, hey, hey, whadaya say... hit or sit?Big king, too bad...Hear what?When?Who told you that?Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?Yeah...", "clean_line": "martini turn martini appointment busy man turn martini martini throw card throw club clubs let hand gentlemen excuse pressing matters attend yes perfectly correct yes miss ratched correct miss ratched yes correct speculate reasons miss ratched given conditions sublime relationship coupled subsequent annihilation held sacred mentally physically emotionally thing speculate late date justify existence life dear wife point carry fully understand function relationship regardless form content matter opinion sense humor trying know know makes feel peculiar throw like hesitate mean day allusion wife possible sexual problems having know case way broached idea teaching making aware condition life categorically speaking hell taber justify condition life matter carry fully understand function regardless form content regardless fact try understand function capacity obtain personify condition condition existence existence pecking party simple ve ward hours simplified work freud jung maxwell jones grand analogy pecking party miss ratched competent psychiatric nurse kind monster pecking eyes electro shock therapy friend cents worth electricity everybody hair persist ways ship medical surgery lobotomy trying tell hell lover boy scoring points buddy man job right homely mister mcmurphy fact beautiful young lady yes thank miss ratched meeting reflecting seriously nature problem naturally referring capacity obtain necessary results order obtain personify existence relationship regardless function regardless function confront question yes yes question existence relationship function confront yes confronting moment deepest crisis yes crisis souls souls trying fully understand problem problem shut understand fully capacity obtain personify question existence depends depends question reflect reflect reflect baseball game isn worth risk friend propose accomplish little feat friend mean going try pick thing shove window hands dollars okay sucker giving leave pouting hear talking help think confusing nice send post card running charity ward plan mack talking everybody covered everybody covered pass ball pass pass pass open mcmurphy pass ball mack refuse started trust mcmurphy pass ball sure mack okay suckers place bets big ace lovely lady ace little trey hey hey whadaya hit sit big king bad hear told true mcmurphy killed attendants escaped yesterday yeah"}}}
