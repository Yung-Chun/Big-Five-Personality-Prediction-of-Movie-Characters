JUNGLE - LATE AFTERNOON Nico in the point, leading Fox and the three CIT men down an unmarked, twisting trail. We see from Nico's gait that he is athletic, a born leader and totally at home in the jungle. 11 TRAIL - LATE AFTERNOON snakes along a ridge line, high enough to give us a view and let us know these guys are way out in the boonies.They're in there.What the hell's wrong?Back off, partner -- Zagon turns from Nico. He moves close to the second prisoner, close as a lover, displaying the blade in the lamplight.Shut up, Nico.Are you crazy?!! What the fuck's the matter with you?!!! Nico is shaking with rage and fear. He takes several steps away from the hooch, then draws up abruptly. Nico pulls his .45 from his holster, pops the safety, starts back for the hooch --Nico!I'll cover this. Get back to the L.Z. -- -- I'll fix it! Get out! Get the fuck outa here! The CIT man calls out to the Cambodian troops, in dialect, pointing at Nico. The soldiers start toward Nico, as if to seize him. Fox, too, starts yelling to the troops in dialect, apparently countermanding the orders of the CIT men. The troops, confused, hold up for a moment.I'll call for a chopper... get outa here!You should know not to use a name on an open line. I'm gonna talk for fifteen seconds, then I'm getting off. You're in trouble, Nico. 204 BACK TO NICO'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHTSerious, serious trouble. Take your wife and family and get them someplace safe now. 205 BACK TO STREET - PHONE BOOTH - LATE NIGHTYou hear me? Now. I'm risking my ass by telling you this. Good luck, kid. 206 BACK TO NICO'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT The PHONE CLICKS DEAD. Nico tries to keep a casual ex- pression. Sara sees through it -- she knows he's shaken. * SARA * That was Fox, wasn't it?Close range, huh? Never work. Place is rigged, scanned every 35 seconds.Roof's wired too. Sensors every fifteen feet. Fox's finger rests ready on the trigger.You can turn now. Slowly. Slooowly... Nico turns. We see Fox clearly now. His boyish features have weathered since his \"spook\" days in Vietnam. There is grey in his hair now: he wears an expensive suit and is alone.I figured you'd do your recon from this building.Getting a bit of a tire.Hong Kong.Uh uh. Uhhh-uh... I know what you can do when you get too close to a man. 367 CLOSEUP - NICO * NICO * I don't believe you, Fox. * 367A INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT *-- What's so hard to believe. I want to help you, you dumb guinea!If I wanted to cap you, I'd have saved myself this chit-chat. Make big points for me to bring in your scalp. I'd be White House material.Zagon's a rancher. 4000 acres in Costa Rica. Beautiful place.And a ton a week of coke from other places.Legal tender.That's my job, Nico. They arrive at an elevator.Keep your nose in the corner. When we get out, stay five paces ahead of me. Cross down to the garage. 367B INT. LOWER CORRIDOR Nico and Fox emerge from the elevator. Nico lowers his hands from behind his head. Fox keeps his gun out of sight as he and Nico step past. 368 ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHTKeep walking.If your name was Joe Smith I never would have caught it. But how many Nicola Toscani's are there?I tried to warn you, old buddy. I knew you had wiretaps. and I knew you wouldn't let 'em go.Why not? The Romans did.We're an empire too.Would you rather spoon borscht and quote Lenin? I'm trying to save you, asshole! I got a spot for you. Thailand, deep under, no names, no numbers --You 'consult.' You 'assist.' You send checks to your family. Zagon won't touch you, you'll be on the team --In five years you're out, with a fat Swiss account and a GS-15 pension. Nico stares at his old friend with contempt. He sees the gun under Fox's coat, but he's too tired and too disgusted to care --Stop right there!I didn't bring him, Nico. I swear it!Stay still! Don't fucking move!!Dive, Nico!! He FIRES -- at Salvano! In the same instant, Salvano pulls his own trigger! Salvano's MACHINE GUN BURST cuts Fox down, a milli-second before Fox's .45 SLUG BLOWS Salvano off his feet! Pandemonium. Fox, dying, slings his .45 to Nico, who snatches it from the ground just as a HAIL of MACHINE GUN FIRE THUNDERS around him. Nico dives headlong behind a concrete column, which is instantly chewed to shreds by GUNFIRE. Zagon FIRES his MAC-10 on full automatic. A second agent hurries forward to outflank Nico. Nico pops from behind the column, DRILLS the agent broadside behind the ear, blowing the whole side of his head off!

The group continues along the ridge.Why don't you light a bonfire?I don't trust these yo-yo's. 15 FULL SHOT - BASE CAMP We see Nico moving like a shadow from one defensive position to another, checking the perimeter. We can vaguely hear him ROUSTING the Cambodian lookouts, speaking in dialect.What the fuck does this have to do with military intelligence?Fox --I don't cap him now, he's gonna do me later.I think we got a little problem here.That's what you get for not marrying a Sicilian. Sara lets Nico struggle a moment, then takes over. *You give up being the D.A. and hurry up and find the right fella, Jax. You might have time for one of these yourself.Watanabe! Say hey, Doc.I'm happy, Branca. I like what I do. Branca glances seriously to the other uncles, then, with a smile, pats Nico's cheek.We're happy.An art gallery.Uncle Gio, that kind of help I don't need. I'd rather get shot by someone I don't know. Jackson and Lukich crack up. The others follow. For the moment, the tension is dispelled.What are you doing in here, Mama? Go join the party... Nico comes down the hall, tucking in his shirt -- stops to give his mother a squeeze. O.S. from the bedroom: the sound of QUIET SOBBING. Nico glances in. 46 INT. NURSERY - DAY * Sara and another woman sit on the bed, comforting a 60-ish * grandmother Zingaro, who is crying. Nico comes in. He kneels before MRS. ZINGARO, concerned.Mrs. Z. Is this a way to act on the day of my son's baptism? The poor woman can't meet Nico's eyes.It's that kid from the bar on Damen? The one with the drugs?Listen to me, Mrs. Z. Are you listening? I have to go to work now. But I'll come by tonight. You'll be at the bakery?We'll talk, okay? We'll find a way to take care of this.I promised the Lieutenant, I'm gonna take care of you. Broken windows and lost kittens for your last week. WIDEN SHOT to include Nico and Jackson.I gotta take a quick leak. Stay put.Gentlemen. One Jacket treats him like he doesn't exist, and begins to pick his nose.You seen this girl?That's witty.Come on. Show me something. No one moves.I get it. It's a gay bar. Is that it?You seen the top of her head, huh? Like I seen your mother's -- Or was it yours? Or yours? I couldn't tell, it looked like her ass -- Nico rages like a beast.Come on, motherfuckers. Do it. Do it! One man -- Nico lunges for the Bad Dude, grabs him like he's about to tear his face off --You cocksuckers are brave enough with 14-year-old girls. 55A INT. FLOPHOUSE HALLWAYGet outta here. We look in the apartment.This ain't your day, kid.That's two years. He jerks the Pimp back, rips open a drawer. More pills and glacene bags.That's four. She'll get you eight more. And I'm just warming up -- Lucy is crying hysterically. Nico flings the Pimp, face * bloody, toward the open door. *Get your clothes on, Lucy.Not when I get through with him. Nico lifts the Pimp by the throat, pins him to the wall.Shipment, my ass.What lawyer?We'll get her some clothes and a bath. I'm not bringing her home to her grandmother like this. DISSOLVE TO:When I was overseas, I saw some things. Things that eat your guts out. Things that stay in front of your eyes like they were burned in and branded. He turns to Jackson.You can walk away from them, Jax. You can quit, but you know it's still going on. You try something anyway -- -- I know I'm not going to change the world. I can't stop the tonnage coming in, I can't fight the boys behind the desks pushing their buttons --But maybe here, huh? Maybe in my own city, my own neighborhood, on my own block -- maybe here I can do something.That's why I'm a shitheel cop.Carla... Carla -- I just want the name of your boyfriend --Take it easy, sister.Maybe we can bust him for that. Jackson spots something, gestures subtly out window --Lighten up, Jax. No one's bringing this into court.I don't give a shit how we do it. I just wanna get there. Jackson gives Nico a dirty look, but stifles her protest.I got the shipment. *'... Engine block has cleared customs. Serial number VA-748. Pick up Tuesday, 3 May as authorized.'Unit Ten Tango X-ray. I need a vehicle registration I.D.'86 Lincoln. Illinois 354 Dog '67. *I want to know when he wipes his * behind. * 85 SERIES OF SHOTS As Nico and Jackson tail the Lincoln out of the industrial zone into a fancier, non-Latin neighborhood. On the sidewalks we glimpse theatergoers, fashionable white couples out on the town. 86 LINCOLNJackpot.Two for drinks. They elbow up to the packed bar, standing. Nico squints toward the rear dining room.You'll have your engine block next Tuesday, boss. 93 BACK TO NICO AND JACKSONCheer up, partner. I'm gonna make you famous.Don't you like company, Luke? We got all the scouts here -- Drug Enforcement Agency, the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms --This is our channel, dickhead. And our collar.Here we go, boys and girls -- You stay put. *It's going down now. Move! 103 EXT. REAR OF PACKING PLANT - DAY The station wagon men heave their rear door open, the van men start to open their side door. The Lincoln is stopped at a distance. Suddenly -- 104 NICO AND LUKICH burst from the rear door of the packing plant, guns drawn.How many kilos you got in there, Skivuzo? Salvano couldn't answer if he wanted to. The other cops look at Nico with awe. Lukich whips the van door open, yanks a tarp off the cargo. 123 INT. VAN The engine block sits in a wooden shipping frame, wrapped with industrial plastic. Nico climbs into the van, rips the plastic sheeting off, grabs the wood slats of the shipping frame, tears them off. In the background, ambulances are arriving to care for the wounded cops and criminals.What kinda fuckin' high is this? CUT TO:Sir. With all respect to our brothers in the Bureau -- * -- That's no answer. It's no answer to why one of the biggest dealers in the city is out on the street now, free as a bird!That's my Lawrence Welk collection!Anything you say, Jax. How about Salvano's?Poetry, ain't it? 140 EXT. REAR SALVANO'S RESTAURANT - DAYAnd now for some dessert.And that must be Mrs. Sal. So nice to see married couples still in love.Yeah. But I bet she's never seen these boys in the choir. 150 NICO'S POVFather Genarro. The priest seizes Nico's hand warmly, smiles at Jackson.When did this happen?How long have they been here?Who did it, Father?Really, I don't mind coming by.I'm a married man, Father. I've got no sins to confess.Help each other move outside. Be calm. 175 EXT. SIDE OF CHURCH - MORNING From a doorway and a shattered window smoke pours forth. We hear SCREAMS from inside. 176 INT. CHURCH Nico on his feet, plainly the leader in this moment of terror. Worshippers, shattered and bleeding, pour past him toward the door. Nico grabs a stout-looking church- goer.Call 911. Tell 'em to send everything they got! Sara, get the baby and Mama * outside. Nico starts for the altar where the damage is worst.I want a list of everyone that's been treated here today. Everyone.Then find those sanctuary people, the ones we saw in the church basement -- As Jackson makes notes.Find out where they're from, why anyone would want to harm them.Just stay near a radio. I'll find you.Sara... go down to the car; I'll * be with you in a minute. He hails Neeley. *I need to talk to you. ... Alone. Neeley nods. Nico leads him off the corridor, through a * fire exit door -- 185 STAIRWELL LANDING The door closes behind them. Nico and the FBI man are alone on the stairway landing. AGENT NEELEY * What the hell is it, Toscani? Without warning, Nico grabs Neeley by both lapels, slams * him furiously into the wall!You. That's what the hell it is! AGENT NEELEY * Get your goddam hands off me! Neeley tries to shake free; Nico won't let him. *You let Salvano walk. AGENT NEELEY * Salvano?! Are you crazy? What does he have to do with this?That was no cherry bomb in there. That was C-fucking-4! I've used that shit.I know what it smells like, I know what it blows like --I tailed Salvano. Two days ago. Him and one of his apes were in that church -- and they weren't taking communion. I saw some broad saw who was with his lawyer plant the bomb. Now I want some goddamn answers. AGENT NEELEY * You tailed him? After I ordered you off?Where is he? Where's Salvano? AGENT NEELEY * My orders were release him. Not babysit him. Neeley brushes Nico's fingermarks off his lapels. * AGENT NEELEY * You think you're rough stuff, Toscani -- martial arts hero, chop suey crap. Well I'll tell you something: you're not bullet- proof. You're not even a good cop. You sneak around, playing your street dick games. But all you come up with is conjecture, wild coincidence and bullshit.I want the agent who signed for the explosives.Bank on it, pal.Who put up the money?You didn't come after me for a piece of ass. Who paid you?Shut up! The girls instantly go silent in terror. Nico turns back to Machete Man, spins him violently face-down, jacking the punk's right arm straight out behind him. We see that Nico can break his elbow with one blow.Give it to me! Nico raises his fist to strike.If you're lying to me, I'll come and kill you right in your own fucking kitchen.Gracias, muchacho. Nico walks away.Of course I will. I've been waiting to hear from Jax. She was supposed to get back to me by now.I'm willing to break the rules; I'm willing to tell you whatever I know. But I need some time. Could you just give me some time? Nico leans to kiss her, but is cut off by the HARSH RING of a PHONE. Sara starts at the sound. She and Nico glance at each other --This better be good, Jax.Long time, Nelson.It's okay, sweetheart -- -- You know what a crazy bastard Fox is. He gets drunk and forgets he's halfway around the world. He calls me. Nico gives her a squeeze and a smile.He just wanted to make sure we got his Christmas card.It's a little early for breakfast, O'Hara.No, you won't. I'm gonna give it to you.It's all right, darling.It's all a mistake, Sara -- It's * gonna be all right. The cops steer Nico toward the door.When were you born, asshole? AGENT NEELEY * Associating with known felons. Disobeying direct orders --Where's Jackson?You'll never build a frame on this chickenshit. AGENT NEELEY * You were ordered to back off on Salvano. But you had too big a hard-on for that, didn't you--Fred. You can't be in on this. Nico faces his lieutenant -- a look that calls on long * years of comradeship and loyalty. Strozah is torn. He's a good man, over his head in a situation he doesn't com- pletely understand. LIEUTENANT STROZAH * You're officially suspended, Toscani. I want your tin... and your iron. Neeley leans past Nico; drops Nico's gun onto the table. Nico looks to Strozah, who averts his eyes. Nico flips his badge onto the table.You holding me?Sara, I'm okay. I love you. *I'll be home later. Lukich will * be there. Tell mama not to worry. Jackson and Lukich are waiting by Nico's car. They see Nico emerge from the phone booth.You're gonna make a helluva D.A., Jax.That's how Fox knew.Luke. I want you to go to my house. Call Branca... my mother has the number. Get my family ready to move out.Stay with 'em. We'll be there.I got a call last night. An old agency friend. He told me my family was in danger. Jax and Lukich can't put all the pieces together yet. But if it's drugs-CIA-Senate, it's got to be heavy.Sister... you know me. Tell them there's no need for fear.I was there... in the church. They tried to kill my family, too. Several of the refugees look like they want to speak, but they are terrified.I know there was a man here, from an American senator's office. Who was he going to speak to? The refugees become increasingly anxious.Was it you, senora? Was it you? More silence. Glances among the people. Finally:Who? Father Genarro?But the bomb... The bomb was planted to destroy the pulpit.It was Father Tomassino they were trying to kill.Where is Tomassino? Where is he now? The nun shakes her head. Nico looks to the refugees. They don't know, either.If you know where he is, you've got to tell me. I want to help him. I can help him. The refugees lower their eyes. Bonifacia continues her soft weeping. Nico glances to Jackson; her look says \"Enough, let's leave these poor people alone.\" Nico stands, touches Bonifacia one more time on the shoulder -- 218 EXT. CHURCH DAY CARE BUILDING - DAYYou're outa this, Jax. Go home.Just paperwork, you understand?Over here, you sons-a-bitches! Nico's rage is superhuman. The men stare in conster- nation. One of the men has a fresh magazine half into his weapon --Try it. Be my guest.Over there! Move it! -- Now!! The men are scared shitless. They put their hands in back of their heads; trot jelly-legged --Hands on the counter! Three men do it; the fourth is slow.Don't tempt me, ASSHOLE -- The fourth obeys. Nico moves to the pay phone on the wall, covering the men with his .45. He grabs the re- * ceiver in his free hand; tries to dial. Adrenaline makes his hand shake; the dials spin wrong -- One of the men sees Nico's dilemma. To hit 911, Nico has to take his eye momentarily off his captives. As Nico turns again to the dial -- A free-standing sales display hurtles toward him, crashing into his gun hand. One of the men has lunged into the display; now he dives atop Nico a second later. The whole human pile crashes, thundering into a glass freezer. Somehow Nico gets to his feet. One of the men grabs Nico's gun; Nico swings one of the freezer doors -- Wham! -- smack into the man's face. The GLASS SHATTERS; the man drops like a rock. Now it's three against one -- prime odds for Nico. He wades into his attackers. A coffee stand goes flying. A body sails into a makeup display. One fool is lucky enough to land a blow that bloodies Nico's nose; he pays with a shattered forearm and a head-first heave into an ice cream locker --Get their stuff into the car now. Do it in the alley, not the driveway. I'll be there in five minutes. CUT TO: 241 TWO MORE POLICE CARSSara... *You'll be safe with Uncle Branca. It's gotta be this way... I'm sorry.Don't you think I'd rather be with you? He holds her passionately. Rosa coughs loudly in the doorway.I am if you are. SARA * Don't worry -- We needed a vacation, anyway. Sara takes her suitcase, hurries out -- ** I'll give you five minutes start. We have to do it this way. They get their suitcases into the sedan. Mama and the baby are already aboard. Sara gets into the passenger seat. * Lukich comes around from the front, glancing around like a lookout.Where's Jax?They killed the wrong priest. Lukich doesn't understand.There was a second priest... from Costa Rica... hiding at the church. He was the one they meant to kill. Nico starts to remove a large piece of ducting from the basement heater.No.Just stay with my family Nico replaces the piece of foundation, starts back up the steps.You don't want to know. 248 EXT. ALLEY BEHIND NICO'S HOUSEDon't forget your seat belt.Keep walking -- -- I'm bucking for number one.When?Who? Who took it?Dump your shoes. Ditch your I.D. on the floor. Nico watches the FBI man obey.So you think I'm a lousy cop, huh, Neeley? Maybe I am. But I haven't got * my face buried up Washington's ass. AGENT NEELEY * Nobody buys me, Toscani.Yeah? Then somebody pulled the plug on your brain, pal. You didn't come up with the second priest, did you? Or Harrison's dead aide. Hurry up! * You heard the radio. The Agency's pushing buttons and bodies are dropping like flies. You assholes are missing half the case!Watch your step.Listen, Wat... you know I wouldn't call in a favor --The old Spook. CUT AWAY TO: 263 OMITTED 265 INT. JACKSON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Jackson has the Senator's aide's papers spread before her, cataloging them with interest. The PHONE RINGS. Jackson picks it up.It's a start. Nico sits down beside Watanabe. DISSOLVE TO: 267 FULL ASHTRAY Watanabe stubs out a cigarette. Empty coffee cups all around. Nico paces, reading a hard-copy printout.Fox has had a helluva career. '69 to '76, Cambodia, Laos. Operation Phoenix. Operation Green Mountain. Operaton Northstar. This is all Vang Pao, it's all heroin --Run personnel retrievals on all these operations. I want the names of every company man who was on them.Altshuler. Cosgrove. I know half these guys -- Okay... now run me an update. Where are these fuckers now? QUICK DISSOLVE TO:Thirty names from secret drug operations... and two-thirds of 'em are in Central America. All right. Run these two names: Bautista Salvano and Ramon 'Chi Chi' Testamente.Where's Fox's printout? 1976... Fort Benning. He recruited these pricks! DISSOLVE TO:Fox is here, in Chicago... or was here... ... Listen. Can this thing tap into airlines? Reservations records --Five agents from Central American desk. All trained assassins. All arrived in Chicago in the last week -- and none of them has left. Nico grabs his coat, gulps a last swallow of coffee --Thanks, Wat. You finally may have done some good for your country.To find a priest.How did ya find him?You're our backup. If we come out running, then you can shoot. Nico's eyes meet his partner's. It's plain he'll break her leg if he has to, to keep her safe by the car. Jackson accepts this reluctantly.Go! Go! -- Simultaneously FIRING back through the kicked-in door, EMPTYING his GUN.-- Had to be a hero... another fucking hero. I'm sorry Jax. He reaches for a small calendar, looks at it.-- Senator... -- -- dumb fuck... think they're gonna let you put 'em outta business -- 327A INT. EMERGENCY ROOM CORRIDOR - NIGHTThe motherfuckas got Jackson.That broad didn't trust me. CUT TO: 331 EXT. BRANCA'S SAFE HOUSE - POV FROM WINDOW - NIGHTEver notice how clean babies smell? Like nothing in the world has touched them yet.Don't push me like this -- Her eyes meet his -- loving, but desperate.You don't know what the hell you're talking about.You know I can't go to him. Sara takes both his hands in hers.I don't have much time, Uncle. So I must speak plainly. Larusso listens. Nico waits for a beat. Then:-- For as long as I've been old enough to think, I've hated you and hated everything you stood for. Larusso takes this in without a flicker.I was so sure that you and I were on opposite sides of the fence... and that you and your people were destroying this country -- Nico pauses, glances away across the grounds.-- The most painful realization of my life was that the people I worked for and you are not far apart. -- And there's not much difference between what you are and what I was. Larusso studies Nico a long moment. Then takes Nico's elbow. * 347 OMITTED * 348 NICO AND LARUSSOKurt Zagon.I will do that, Mr. Larusso. I hope you will be well.It's all here. Nico turns to his uncle. Regards him with affection.It's not your business.Grazie, tio caro. Branca pats Nico's cheek.That wasn't the plan, Nelson. 366 NELSON FOX covers Nico from behind with a silencer-fitted .45. He glances to the briefcase and building plans, on the floor.I was thinking of a mine on the roof. Remote-triggered, when the chopper comes in.You're looking fit, Nelson.Your own tailor?You've gone a long way. Fox motions for Nico to dump his gun; Nico complies, dropping it gently into the briefcase. Nico takes half a step toward Fox. Fox shakes his head in warning.Fox the fixer.Is that what Zagon is? One of your basement boys?Bought with what -- opium from Cambodia?Which he funnels here through Salvano. With the Company getting its cut.Still dodging appropriations committees, eh, Nelson?The Senator couldn't be bought, could he? He was gonna blow the lid off, so you cleared Zagon to frost him --But the priest found out somehow and ran here. You couldn't do the Senator's number 'till you knew if the priest had talked. So Zagon flew in with his little medical bag. Only by then I was in on it -- and you thought I might recognize his handiwork.You got it off the arrest sheet.Only I was too dumb to crack it. I was so busy trying to figure a code, I didn't even recognize Zagon's voice. It's all crystal clear to Nico now.So we kill our own senators now.Are we the Romans?Doing what -- processing heroin?Fuck you.You know, Fox, right now in Israel they're trying some 80-year-old camp guard for war crimes. And all around our country there are guys on Death Row for killing one person, two people. And probably they all deserve it -- He takes a step toward Fox. Fox's hand tightens on his gun.-- but you and I know a couple guys personally who are responsible for the murder of at least what... 60,000 non- military personnel. Viet. Lao. Thai. Cambodian. Librarians, teachers, doctors... women, children... and that's just a sliver of it. Fox tries to maintain a hard face. But his own guilty conscience is working --We've wiped out entire fucking countries. And not one agent ---- not one C.I.A. agent has ever been tried or convicted, much less accused of any crimes. You motherfuckers think you're above the law -- Well, you ain't above mine. Nico holds himself, trembling with intensity. At that moment -- O.S. from the garage entrance ramp: the SQUEAL of APPROACHING TIRES. Nico and Fox turn to see -- *NOTE* 4-17-87. THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE WILL BE MODIFIED TO CONFORM TO LOCATION. DO NOT BUILD OR PURCHASE WITHOUT CHECKING WITH STUNT COORDINATOR AND ASSISTANT DIRECTORS. STORYBOARDS AND NEW PAGES WILL BE AVAILABLE NEXTWell... well. What a team we have here.Thanks for the help, Fox.How are you gonna do him, Zagon? In a motorcade? Or passing through a hotel kitchen? The Noose agent jerks his cable tight, making Nico gag and choke. Zagon motions to slacken off. He stops at a small table before Nico -- unrolls a well-worn felt pouch. Zagon watches Nico's reaction as the tools of the inter- rogator's trade come into view -- drug vials, syringes, scalpels, surgical tools.Long enough to finish you. Sweating, half-spitting, Zagon slashes at Nico like an animal -- Nico traps the knife, and enters, smashes Zagon in the face with one lightning blow. We see Zagon's nose and face completely cave in. Nico comes under Zagon's elbow, the arm that still holds the knife clamping it in a vise-like grip and bending it backwards, slowly, against the joint -- which now starts to rip in half. Zagon is screaming and cursing, writhing in agony -- The drugs have hit Nico full force now. He's weakening, his eyes are starting to roll. Zagon tries one last surge of strength to save himself; it almost seems he'll wriggle free when: the elbow JOINT SNAPS in half with a sicken- ing sound.Your Honor. The Judge nods to his stenographer, who swiftly sets up her equipment, takes a seat. Rosa makes a face at Branca, who rises, clearing a seat for the Judge. Sara moves * in tight beside Nico.If you're ready to listen, I'm ready to talk. 423 CLOSE - STENOGRAPHER'S HANDS As the Judge's VOICE begins OVER, \"slating\" the depo- sitions, the stenographer's

You don't have to wait for results.Where is it, Charley? You got six tons of our shit -- The prisoner tries to speak, but he's in such torment all that comes out is a blood-curdling wail -- 21 EXT. BAST CAMP - NICODon't you die on me, fucker --This pussy can't hold his liquor.So my little doctor bag doesn't * scare you, eh? Well I don't need * it to open your yap. * Zagon reaches to a scabbard on his Western belt, pulls out a fearsome serrated blade -- a cross between a bowie knife and a scalpel. He steps toward the prisoner, displaying the blade in the lantern light.Where's our load, you sack of slime? What did you do with my shit? -- 27 ZAGON punches the prisoner full in the face, holding the knife handle in his fist to double the force of the blow and to terrify him with the proximity of the blade. The prisoner crashes sideways, face bloody --I'm gonna teach you good. I'm gonna teach you never to fuck with my opium --You're a hard nigger, aren't you, boy? You took it from the Chinks... you took it from the French. You'll be fucked if some Yankee peckerwood's gonna start your gums flapping -- Nico watches Zagon move the knife blade closer to the prisoner.-- Well, you're gonna chirp for me, tough guy. You're gonna sing like a choir --Your orders are 'assist and observe' cherry -- Zagon turns to face Nico --I'm gonna start carving at your ankles. We'll throw your feet in that box right over there. Then I'm gonna take off your arms -- One of the CIT men yanks the prisoner's leg forward, clamping it to the ground with his hands. The prisoner still hasn't flinched. He seems as locked into this dance of death as Zagon.You can disappear as easy as this slope, kid --You'll be in heaven in a few minutes, padre. But first I'm going to put you through hell. 293 EXT. CHICAGO STREET - NIGHTYou came here to talk to the * Senator's aide, didn't you? *Who told you about our plans? *You wouldn't lie to me, Father? It's a sin.If you spoke to anyone, tell me now -- -- and I won't have to use this.Speak to me, Father -- who did you tell?I want to know who you told.-- Tell me the truth, Father -- The priest's eyes roll grotesquely; he convulses, sweat beading on his forehead. He looks like a man in the agonies of some narcotic hell.-- Can we kill him? If you told anyone, about our plans to kill the senator, we cannot do it.Get him! Finish him!Now! Nico bolts for the stairwell to the roof, clawing for a new clip as he goes. Salvano and Zagon burst into the hallway, SHOOTING at Nico. 308 INTERCUT - ELEVATED TRAIN THUNDERING along the tracks adjacent to the building.We've been looking for you, Nelson. I see you've found our friend.Have you two been sharing fond memories? Reminiscing about the good old days?Bring in our friend, Nelson. Salvano's muzzle covers Fox and Nico --Be a good boy -- 372 FOXMove! Nico springs from cover, FIRING, trying to bolt down the garage ramp, toward the lower levels. His path puts the first agent directly in Zagon's line of fire. Zagon doesn't hesitate; he OPENS UP on Nico, cutting down his own man -- Salvano has gotten to his feet, wounded, but still handling his gun. He joins Zagon, rushing forward --No! I want him! I want him alive! 402 EXT. MIDLAND HOTEL - NIGHT *All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.We've got an hour before the honorable senator. You've got to learn to take time, smell the roses.I've used these little beauties many times to extract information -- -- This'll be the first time I've ever used them... just for fun.Take his arms. Pistol agent and Bad Dude move in, one on each side, * seizing Nico's forearms. Shotgun agent holds his weapon tight to Nico's head.Hold him up! Pistol agent and Bad Dude lift Nico. Zagon slams him again. Again. Nico's cheekbone is broken; blood drains from his nose. Zagon aims a two-handed blow; backhands Nico, crushing the other side of his face! Zagon backs off, chest heaving. Pistol agent and Bad Dude plop Nico back in the chair, gagging, choked by the noose. Nico looks like the Viet prisoner -- the one we saw in the opening sequence. Like the prisoner, Nico takes his beating -- still conscious, still meeting Zagon's eyes with defiance.This is where you came in, Toscani. Only, now it's where you're gonna check out. He takes off his glove, grabs the syringe. Pistol agent and Bad Dude clamp Nico's right arm down tight. Zagon injects Nico.That's it. Fight it, cherry. Fight it, so it speeds faster on its way -- Nico struggles more violently.Fight it. Till the vessels burst in your brain. Till the arteries rupture in your heart --That's my boy. That's what I was waiting for -- Zagon produces his famous knife. He motions Pistol agent and Bad Dude to release Nico's arms. Noose agent slackens his grip on the choke cable. Zagon moves in closer, gloating, cooing --A fool learns from his own mistakes. But a wise man learns from the mistakes of others -- You should have killed me when you had the chance, Toscani --Can you feel the chemicals, cherry?

VARIOUS STREETS - UNMARKED CARAnd then you're gonna come visit me in a nice, clean, air conditioned office --It's okay, girl. Mama Jax is here.That was some leak you took. From the door of the bar, several bloodied heads peek.Broken windows and lost pussy cats, huh. Jackson checks out her battered partner.You're one crazy bastard, Toscani. Nico opens the rear door, helps Jackson ease Lucy in.I don't get you, Toscani. What the hell are you doing being a shitheel cop? With your background? For a long moment Nico says nothing. Then, quietly, look- ing straight ahead:Why can't you sons-a-bitches ever treat someone with a little respect?I ain't your goddamn sister. We ain't got the same mother, motherfucka. Carla fires one final parting salvo of obscenities, then sags back among the women. Carla starts to cry. Jackson comforts her; Carla responds, lets herself be comforted. CUT TO: 66 EXT. DOWNTOWN - FINANCIAL DISTRICT - DAY Jackson, back in her normal daytime wear, exits a building. She gets into Nico's car.The lawyer's name is Abandano. He's on the third floor. I got a look at him. I couldn't get how he's connected, but according to Carla, he's a lousy lay.That's our stud.Toscani, you're going to have me doing time.Except against us.I thought you said you were gonna protect me. Cover my butt. Be my guardian angel -- Nico hears something through the earphones. Gestures for silence -- 80 ANGLE THROUGH OFFICE WINDOW Chi Chi listens with increased intensity to something on the phone. He starts writing it down -- 81 BACK TO NICO In unmarked car. He's writing it down too.What? What's he saying?Salvano?Gimme something stiff. I need it.Why couldn't it be a week from Tuesday? I could read about it in the paper. Nico grabs her waist, pulls her onto the dance floor, and does a playful twirl.You missed a few spots, boys.'... And so I quit the police department... got myself a steady job -- ' The van accelerates slightly, turns a corner, vanishes. Silence. LUKICH * They spotted me. I'm too good- looking to be a meat slopper. *He has ethics. Unlike certain others on this case.You don't wanna catch him without no gun. Halloran's look asks why not?'Cause what he do with his hands... make bullet holes look pretty.Bad bad.Is that enough? Can we do something normal now -- like eat lunch?Let it be, Nico.What... you kept his tape, too? Nico already has it in the PLAYER. We hear FRAGMENTS of the telephone tap from the body shop in Spanish and English. Jackson looks frustrated. Nico listens care- fully to what appears to be the taped PHONE CONVERSATION.This is your mother's church, isn't it?Dolores Jackson Nico, we gotta go --I didn't know this church was a sanctuary, Father.We can have a car check by, every hour.Amen. Nico and Jackson start off.Right.Where are you gonna be?-- I found the sanctuary people.They're refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala, Chile. They won't talk * to me, they're terrified of cops.Ready for this? One of the people killed at the church was definitely not a congregation member.Alan Singletary. He's an aide to Senator Harrison. Nico is electrified.That's right. Harrison. Foreign relations committee. The guy who's been crawling all over the Central American drug connections.I've been at the Tribune all night, wearing out their Xerox machine. Harrison's staff has been compiling some kind of white paper. He's due to release it next week. Nico's mind races.What?You see this list? Well, I'm not done.I'm not a rookie, Toscani. Now, go home. Get your family out of here. Nico agrees. The pair starts to split.Jackson. Whoever the voice is , it makes Jackson forget the documents.-- Yes... yes, of course, sister, I know who you are. -- where... where are you?The nun phoned me. She said two men had been sneaking around the church. She sounded scared --There's more. I got the papers from that senator's aide's apartment. Everything Harrison's been working on.
