Let me out! The door buzzes and she shoves through.Uh-huh. The true romantic. MARK leans over JESSE, his voice low now, intimate.No.They're not your pictures.I don't think so.Daddy's home. She walks to her bedroom and closes the door.Walter! And she breaks into a run. WALTER looks back, starts running, this is all fun for him. There's the low BLEAT of a TRUCK'S HORN and then... The high, piercing SQUEAL of a wounded animal. In the road, WALTER, laying flat, keening in pain. She runs to him and in one continuous motion SCOOPS him into her arms. RACHEL, in the middle of the two lanes. She turns as.__Help me! Please! It speeds past, dangerously close. Another set of LIGHTS.Stop! Please, stop! But the CAR passes, blaring its horn. She spins,around. is bearing down on her. She holds her ground.THE CAR'S WINDSHIELD -- CRACKS, crazes, as if it hit with a sharp, fierce projectile. THE CAR -- lays down rubber as it screeches to a halt. JESSE is at the wheel. Sees through the crazed windshield: RACHEL, splattered with dog's blood. He gets out, stares at his'windshield, shaken-up, groping for some explanation.It's my fault. He should have been in bed with me.His name's Walter. will he be all right? The VET's intensely focused on inserting an I.V. into the dog.some.But it's... you know, like the song says, you hurt yourself to see if you can still feel.For making you--And I'm sorry about your windshield, about your car.You can be sorry for things that aren't your fault. The VET enters, drying her hands. RACHEL sits up, bracing herself for the bad news. JESSE puts an arm around her seat back, getting ready to hold her.Can I see him?Lisa hLUd them.Sometimes I'd see someone, from behind, and I'd know, I'd just know, it was Lisa. And then she'd turn ound, and it wasn't. But sometimes, you know, it was. And now...I know. I hope I didn't ru;.nYou're very polite, for a jock.I don't have any--Or hitchhike.Thank you. For everything.Sure.Yeah.Dry weather.Lisa don't! Somebody stop her! Stop! SLOW MOTION -- LISA falls through the air towards the car, arms outstretched, hair trailing like black flames. SMASH -- she goes through the windshield, but the face isYesterday morning, she told me she'd, uh, lost her virginity. KELTON looks at SUE, produces the photo of LISA with ERIC.Sure. Eric Stark. He's on the team. KELTON gestures to SUE and they step out into...okay. Fine. Can I go no SUE opens a file on her desk.She's gonna be fine.I guess. I mean, you seem pretty normal.Why?Normal, huh? Get real, I know I'm ten times more likely to get it than most people.They're happy, - 'z-rig as they get their check every month.Never met the gentleman. My mom won't even tell me his name. RACHEL stares at a ceramic MUG of coffee, very close o the edge of the desk.sorry. I must've knocked it. SUE, the color draining from her face.What do you wane from me?--yeah. Okay.He asked me out.I said, \"Okay, its your funeral.\"She's beautiful.jy are going to be late. She hears her doorbell go off.What'd you forget your-- There's nobody there.Oh, god, oh, god. Not now. Stop Suddenly all goes silent. She jumps as... The PHONE RINGS near her. She scoops up the cordless. Beat.Hello?Who is this?Knock it off. Is this you, Arnie?What do you want?I'm calling the police. She hangs up, dials 911, fumbling with the knife.No! The WINDOW SMASHES down on the intruder's HAND. There's a muffled YELL outside and the HAND is extracted.Nothing. She retreats into her bedroom, looks at the Window. The PHONE RINGS in her hand. She answers.curled on her bed with WALTER, calls out:I'm not here.You tell me what happened last night.I mean, guys like you are supposed to date girls like Tracy.All right. Okay. Yes. JESSE lets her pass, with a chivalrous after-you sweep of his hand, then falls in next to her. RACHEL'S arm is grabbed by...What are those, tonight's Top-Ten list?You're wasting your time.False. I don't see the point-This ddesn't make any sense.False. She sets down the SNOW DOME.True.False.True.I have a dog. SUE nods, watches RACHEL closely as she takes her time with this one, not reading off a card.--and fuck you. You're not my mother! RACHEL turns to go. SUE jumps up, grabs her arm, and...Mama, what was it like? WhEn you started to... when things went bad. What did it feel like, what did you see?Did you see things move by themselves? Please, mama. I have to know.My foster-dad taught me on his semi truck. Where we going?All of them?Anybody answer?And the other?Who?So your dad wrote a book, color me impressed.And you like that.What's wrong with that? Sounds like a nice life.It's not so great. Sometimes I wish I could just be one of the shiny, happy people. Does that surprise you?He had a talent. You. You got football. It'll get you outta this place. You can make your own path after that. Write your own book.Um, I don't know how to say this.But I've never...And, I'd want it to be special. Like you ring the doorbell, with flowers in your hand.I don't really get football.All right. I'll be there.Sure, go practice. Go be great. Live the life you want.What do you mean?Uh-huh. Can I get a hint?Where are you taking me?Happy homecoming. Can we go? This place is spooky. Gives me the creeps.You just said. A fire.They think a boiler blew up, okay? Am I gonna be graded on this?Everybody has.of a revenge-suicide thing. Elvis was her date and they escaped in a U.F.O. I know what happened to that snow dome, on my desk.What are you saying I have?With all respect, lady, you're seriously bat-shit. I'm walking, back to the real world. SUE's voice is low, quiet.I don't believe you. She never told me, why would she tell you?So then it's Arkham for me?You want to know what I'm feeling today? `Happy. Happier than I've ever been. So I don't want or need your help. RACHEL runs off. SUE follows, trips on the rubble, falls.You're normal. At the end of the counter, the PERFUME WOMAN approaches a SALESWOMAN helping MONICA.Uh, just looking. The woman gives her a smile of devastating insincerity, crosses her arms and just stands there. RACHEL gets her drift. MONICA walks up behind RAThought she was gonna frisk me.Nothing. Just lookin'.No.There's a shock.Uh-huh.Um, sure. How much are these?Took it off.No. Let's go.I feel like.., we're being watched. She looks up at the MOOSE HEAD's MARBLE EYES, reflecting firelight. JESSE drapes his jacket over the MOOSE HEAD.Feel scared.I'm sorry, I just feel... weird. I don't know. Oh, wow, I am really losing my mind here.Thanks, but...Thought that was a bunt. What?I'm kidding, I'm kidding.Do they have to hit him that hard?Oh, no. RACHEL strains to see him as the team circles around JESSE.Thank, God. He's okay.Yeah.No. Well, yeah, actually some.What type is that? There's an awkward pause which MONICA breaks.No, I'd rather wait for Jesse.Is that tonight's game?What other game?What?Twenty-two? RACHEL stops dancing as she spots LISA PARKER's name at the bottom of ERIC's column with the number four next to it.Lisa.Oh, God MARK leans in to RACHEL, who hasn't noticed JESSE.Mama. Maury? BARBARA'S P.O.V. o but it's a FOUR-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, pristine, without tattoos. BARBARA blinks and her P.O.V. is of a TEN-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, reaching for her. Mama, please. BARBARA blinks and it's now... The 17-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, covered in blood and tattoos. She looks her daughter in the eyes, backs away in terror.Please, I don't have... anyone. She rolls onto her back, looks up at the STARRY NIGHT.Please, God, let me die... And she tightly shuts her eyes..love you. JESSE tenderly kisses her lips. And all the TATTOOS fade from her face and body Love. Her face is serene. JESSE traces his fingers across her brow, embraces her, the flames start to encircle them, just like in RACHEL's nightmare. JESSE pulls RACHEL over the debris ridden floor toward the back windows, but stumbles and goes down. Her eyes flutter open.Leave. Get out Instead of leaving her, JESSE hugs RACHEL closer. The sleeve of his jacket catches flames. And he accepts his fate.

A group of PATIO GIRLS sit at another table. Among them is MONICA, a stunning brunette, AMY a cute redhead and TRACY, an icy BLONDE who could spend all day checking her makeup. JESSE looks over. TRACY graces him with a smile and turns away. MARK leans in to JESSE.Hey, Jess. Tracy, she wants you, man. Jump her bones.So what? You want her to want you cause of your dazzling personality? Look, you want someone to talk to, you got us. H, you screw.When you wake up in the morning, and she's sleeping on your arm, and the only way to get up is to wake her. So you gnaw your arm off instead. BRAD snorts a laugh. A goatee'd ENGLISH TEACHER nods to both camps as he passes.Backfield in motion. PULL BACK TO -- Pub decor with football paraphernalia everywhere; Bulldog lamps and paw prints painted on the floor. The bar's packed with local BUSINESSMEN. JESSE, MARK and the other BULLDOGS are in a corner booth. A.middle-aged, bearded WAILER with half his face bur -SS-arred approaches.Hey, Al, we'll have three 1\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd.rge pepperoni pies and two pitchers of beer.Yo, Jes$, I think Tracy's following you. He pulls out the black NOTEBOOK. ERIC eyes it, gets very nervous.Now then, according to the scoreboard Jess, you'd have to bag every girl here to catch up. You need the points. I'll give ya ten for Tracy.And she freaked and took a header.No one knows 'bout you and her.Shit. Okay. I'll handle it.Eric, relax, its me, Mark. I'll handle it. The WAITER sets a pitcher of soda and cups on the table. AT THE BAR -- MR. STARK, a rotund lawyer in his 40's, takes a pitcher of beer from the BARTENDER.Absolutely. We're gonna crush Carlin Friday and make it seven years in a'row.It's good to be king.So, Rachel, there were some pictures Lisa took. They have, what you might call sentimental value. She just stares at him. MARK pulls a twenty from his wallet.Twenty bucks cover it?What do you mean? I'll go thirty.Well it's not like she's gonna be picking them up, is it? RACHEL turns away. JESSE glares at MARK.Rachel, why don't I come by when you get off and, you know, take you for a ride? JESSE cocks an ear for her reply, but she doesn't answer.Why not?Let's go, Jess. The car pulls away, MARK glances in the REARVIEW MIRROR at RACHEL, framed like a target.Bitch. I'll show you funny. ON RACHEL -- watching them go. Seconds later, a SHERIFF'S CRUISER pulls up.He shoots, he scores. ON TRACY -- in the front seat, using the rearview to adjust her makeup, pleased with what she sees. She glances at JESSE as he re-enters on the driver's side.Bitch wouldn't give it to me. Stay frosty, no one else knows anything. It's still at the photomat, I'll get it.Not me. I love it. MARK pops up, grabs a steak, rips off a bite, and runs full tilt at the, blocking tackle, smashing into it with meaning.What happened?Relax, that's bullshit. Your dad's a lawyer, he'll kill that talk dead.What about Carlin?I tried. That Rachel bitch wouldn't give'em to me..who is Wig?Ding, ding, ding. Wrgnq, guess again.You. The JIGGLING and the TAPPING starts up again, loud. The BOYS VOICES are heard outside chanting...Don't go tellin' stories about my Eric. Click and the line goes dead. She hangs up. The PHONE RINGS again. She doesn't answer.Brad, how many points he gonna get for straightening a dyke?What's with him?Jess, what's the matter?What? Papering McCabe's house? I asked you if you--what? We were just sendin' her a message. JESSE slams his locker closed.Look, man. She's getting Eric in all kinds a shit. I mean, if he gets charged with rape, there goes anyWhat are you getting bent for? She's just a burnout, a slut-- BANG as JESSE shoves MARK against a locker. MARK shoves him back. The rest of the PLAYERS in the background go quiet.What's wrong with you?Get to the bad part.What are you talking about? We're friends, we're all friends.Let's nail the bitch. Plan a way to screw her like she's screwing us. .TRACY, a wicked smile as she nods.Hey. Just wanted to say two things. I'm sorry. Maybe I overreacted.I'm not. We've been friends since we could both pee standing up. And I thought we'd be best friends forever.I'm sorry.You're right. I'll come up with a way to make it up, to b of you. tryin', brother, I'm tryin'.Hey, man, I got it. This girl, this Rachel, is special to you, huh?The cabin. My folks aren't there. Get away from all of us idiots. Go have a romantic time. JESSE looks at him. MARK tosses the key, JESSE catches it. MARK smiles.And bring her to my party. I'll show you we can be one big, happy family.C'mon, Jess, you're up. JESSE stares in horror at how identical they all look now. Then he starts to... giggle, then breaks into laughter, turns and walks away.Hey, Chuckzilla, why don't you put on the highlights tape?Yeah, tonight's game.No, it's the other game. Still dancing, she turns back to the group.The game you were in. The others laugh. She smiles, confused.Yeah, yeah, what was the score? Chuckie, pass me the scoreboard, I wanna show Rachel how she helped Jesse win the game. CHUCK pulls the BLACK NOTEBOOK next to the CD's off a shelf, pretends he's a quarterback hiking a ball. Twenty-four, twenty-six, hut, hut, hut. He drops back to pass the NOTEBOOK.Rachel, catch! He throws the NOTEBOOK through the air, where it tumbles end over end for a few slow beats, then is caught by her.Open it. Go 'head, read off the scores.What's Eric's score?What's up, Rach? You know someone on that list?Oh, yeah, Lisa, forgot about her.Rach, look under Jesses's name, how many points you get?No, more than that, remember, we thought Rach was a dyke. He got extra-points for the conversion.See, we didn't think Jess could do i so he offered to get evidence, proof that he'd scored you.Lookie, lookie, Rachel. RACHEL realizes people are watching something behind her, then laughing at her. She turns and sees... The IMAGES of her and JESSE on the TV. Her face goes slack with horror.Jess was disappointed with the picture quality, but I told him it was better than Pam and Tommy Lee's tape.Why don't we ask Jesse? He turns and calls out.Hey, Jesse! Over here! JESSE looks over and his eyes meet RACHEL's, but she just stares back, horrified. Then he sees the TV set behind herRachel! Rachel! She tries to get away, but BRAD pushes her into MONICA who shoves her to AMY as they join in the chanting. Rachel!What the fuck? ON JESSE -- as he screams again. A CORKSCREW has pierced his other hand, at waist level. The SCREW spins around, burrowing into his flesh.God, it'ls her! She's doing it! SUE moves towards RACHEL.lowers his shoulder, crashes through a closing door into.Wait till she's closer. TRACY tightens her finger on the trigger. RACHEL's eyes narrow and... TRACY's glasses shatter into her eyes, spewing blood milky fluid. Aaaaa... She staggers, fires her shotgun into ERIC's groin and he lands sitting next to the pool. A dying ERIC stares at his shredded lap, then falls over. MARK looks at his dead friend. Oh, shit. .recovers, and swings his aim back at RACHEL. But his rifle goes sailing over his head and into the grass twenty feet behind him. He makes eye-contact with a grim RACHEL advancing toward him, and hauls ass. RACHEL glances at a coiled GARDEN HOSE and it springs to life, slithering through the grass and across the concrete at high speed to wrap around MARK's ankle and trip him up. He hits the ground hard and rolls over to find the hose twisting around his legs and up his waist like a python.", "clean_line": "having bad hairday group patio girls sit table monica stunning brunette amy cute redhead tracy icy blonde spend day checking makeup jesse looks tracy graces smile turns away mark leans jesse hey jess tracy wants man jump bones want want cause dazzling personality look want talk got screw wake morning sleeping arm way wake gnaw arm instead brad snorts laugh goatee english teacher nods camps passes backfield motion pull pub decor football paraphernalia bulldog lamps paw prints painted floor bar packed local businessmen jesse mark bulldogs corner booth middle aged bearded wailer half face bur ss arred approaches hey al ll \u00ef \u00bd rge pepperoni pies pitchers beer yo jes think tracy following pulls black notebook eric eyes gets nervous according scoreboard jess bag girl catch need points ll ya tracy freaked took header knows bout shit okay ll handle eric relax mark ll handle waiter sets pitcher soda cups table bar mr stark rotund lawyer takes pitcher beer bartender absolutely gonna crush carlin friday seven years row good king rachel pictures lisa took sentimental value stares mark pulls wallet bucks cover mean ll thirty like gonna picking rachel turns away jesse glares mark rachel come know ride jesse cocks ear reply answer let jess car pulls away mark glances rearview mirror rachel framed like target bitch ll funny rachel watching seconds later sheriff cruiser pulls shoots scores tracy seat rearview adjust makeup pleased sees glances jesse enters driver bitch wouldn stay frosty knows photomat ll love mark pops grabs steak rips bite runs tilt blocking tackle smashing meaning happened relax bullshit dad lawyer ll kill talk dead carlin tried rachel bitch wouldn em wig ding ding ding wrgnq guess jiggling tapping starts loud boys voices heard outside chanting tellin stories eric click line goes dead hangs phone rings answer brad points gonna straightening dyke jess matter papering mccabe house asked sendin message jesse slams locker closed look man getting eric kinds shit mean gets charged rape goes anywhat getting bent burnout slut bang jesse shoves mark locker mark shoves rest players background quiet wrong bad talking friends friends let nail bitch plan way screw like screwing tracy wicked smile nods hey wanted things sorry maybe overreacted ve friends pee standing thought best friends forever sorry right ll come way tryin brother tryin hey man got girl rachel special huh cabin folks aren away idiots romantic time jesse looks mark tosses key jesse catches mark smiles bring party ll big happy family mon jess jesse stares horror identical look starts giggle breaks laughter turns walks away hey chuckzilla highlights tape yeah tonight game game dancing turns group game laugh smiles confused yeah yeah score chuckie pass scoreboard wanna rachel helped jesse win game chuck pulls black notebook cd shelf pretends quarterback hiking ball hut hut hut drops pass notebook rachel catch throws notebook air tumbles end end slow beats caught open head read scores eric score rach know list oh yeah lisa forgot rach look jesses points remember thought rach dyke got extra points conversion think jess offered evidence proof scored lookie lookie rachel rachel realizes people watching laughing turns sees images jesse tv face goes slack horror jess disappointed picture quality told better pam tommy lee tape ask jesse turns calls hey jesse jesse looks eyes meet rachel stares horrified sees tv set herrachel rachel tries away brad pushes monica shoves amy join chanting rachel fuck jesse screams corkscrew pierced hand waist level screw spins burrowing flesh god ls sue moves rachel lowers shoulder crashes closing door wait till closer tracy tightens finger trigger rachel eyes narrow tracy glasses shatter eyes spewing blood milky fluid aaaaa staggers fires shotgun eric groin lands sitting pool dying eric stares shredded lap falls mark looks dead friend oh shit recovers swings aim rachel rifle goes sailing head grass feet makes eye contact grim rachel advancing hauls ass rachel glances coiled garden hose springs life slithering grass concrete high speed wrap mark ankle trip hits ground hard rolls hose twisting legs waist like python"}, "JESSE": {"raw_line": "I don't know, you ever have a conversation with her?

The sad-eyed DOG whimpers'and,JESSE scratches him. In the distance the CLOCK TOWER BELL can be heard CHIMING MIDNIGHT: One, two... As JESSE looks down and his eyes widen in surprise: Somehow, he's scrawled on the notebook paper on the desk in front of him: kINg of HELL Or, if you only look at the capitalized letters, it reads: Around it, the same phrase is written over and over again: kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL JESSE lowers the dog How did... Trails off as he stares at the page. The CLOCK BELL in the background is still CHIMING: give, six, seven and...Ssshhhh. Relax, boy. He takes a-deep breath, flips the page on the notebook, resumes his cram session. On the floor, the DOG looks at the open French doors, then scurries under the bed.

STUDENTS bow their heads..a moment of silence.Lisa Parker may be gone, but she will not be forgotten by her friends.What is it?Rachel, is there anything in there that strikes a chord for you? Do you know what Lisa was referring to?Robbie, I had a Freshman crying in the hall last week. I couldn't get anything out of her, but her friend told me a football player slept with her, then dumped her.Eric's 18. Lisa was 15. That's statutory rape.Then let's make it.

As a patient. RACHEL looks surprised.Does that surprise you?Thanks. i try. You visit your moat often?Is that scary for you?Well, children of schizophrenics sometimes live with the fear of it happening to them. At your age, it's perfectly normal to be afraid of turning out like your parents.You're right. I'm sorry. So. You've been in a series of foster homes since you were, what, four?How's your foster family?What about your real father?Rachel, in a way, you've lost your mother. And now you've lost a friend. Losing someone can be a very lonely, painful place to be.I really do care. How can I show you that I do? RACHEL is silent, staring at the MUG.Rachel?

BARBARA regains herself, then, with tremendous conviction...Rachel needs my help. She...So they are half-sisters.There's something you have to see.This used to be the school for the whole district. Chamberlain High. It was closed down in 1976.There was a fire here that year. The night of the prom. Seventy-three people died. A few of us survived.I haven't really been here in over twenty years. But it feels like I've been back here every day since.Do you know what happened here?What caused it?Come on, you've heard of Carrie White.And?We both saw it. RACHEL looks at her, isn't going to talk about this.I know everything there is to know about Carrie White. She did this. It began with what you did, with the snow dome. Then it got out of control.It's a genetic recessive trait. The male is the carrier, when he combines with the right female, the trait surfaces in their offspring, usually in women. Like King's Disease, hemophilia.Its a trait, Rachel, you inherited. Telekinesis.Your mother told me your father was Ralph White. Carrie's father. It stops RACHEL in her tracks.You need help-- Like what? Like they helped you?Yes. No.No. I can help you, get it under control.Rachel!Rachel needs help. She doesn't believe me and I'm afraid for her.
