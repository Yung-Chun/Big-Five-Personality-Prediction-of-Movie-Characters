{"Dumb-and-Dumber": {"LLOYD": {"raw_line": "Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to the medical school? I'm supposed to be giving a lecture in twenty minutes and my driver's a bit lost.I couldn't help noticing the accent. You from Jersey?Austria? You're kidding. Well, g'day, mate. What do you say we get together later and throw a few shrimp on the barbie.Guess I won't be going Down Under tonight...This is 22.Cool your jets, Arnie. I'm on my way.Why you going to the airport? Flying somewhere?Well, I saw your luggage, then when I noticed the airline ticket, I put two and two together. So where you heading?Oh, you're gonna love it. I hear California's beautiful this time of year. Mary looks back out the window and Lloyd sneaks another glance.Name's Christmas. Lloyd Christmas.Uh, this isn't my real job, you know. It's only temporary.Yeah, you see, my friend Harry and I are saving up our money so we can open our own pet store.I got worms.That's what we're gonna call it: I Got Worms. We're gonna specialize in selling worm farms you know, like ant farms. A lot of people don't realize that worms make much better pets than ants. They're quiet, affectionate, they don't bite, and they're super with the kids.Uh... well, sure but they aren't half as affectionate. And if you cut an ant's head off, it won't grow back.And best of all, worm farming is a seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-year industry. I wouldn't mind having a piece of that pie, if you know what I mean.What's the matter? Little tense about the flight?It's really nothing to worry about, Mary. Statistically, they say you're more likely to get killed on the way to the airport. You know, like in a head-on crash, or something.Good thinking. There's a lot of bad rivers out there.Keep it. It was my pleasure.Relax, Mary. Just get trashed and pass out. You'll be there before you know it.Drive around me, you pinhead!Damn!You can't do this! I'll lose my job!I don't mean to be harsh, Harry, but let's face it, you are one pathetic loser. No offense.Of course not. I quit.I had a hunch Arnie was gonna fire me.Winners control their own destiny, Har.Big deal. That car's an old bomb anyway.That's forty-two in dog years.It's a love memento.The most beautiful woman alive. Her name was Mary. I drove her to the airport. Sparks flew, emotions ran high, breasts heaved. She left this case in the terminal and flew to Aspen and out of my life. End of story.DO you really expect me to go snooping around in someone else's private property?It's locked.Friend or foe?Hey, I ordered Mystic Mint. The little swindlers gave me Peanut Butter Praline.That's a hostile pattern. I say we bail and get down to unemployment.Blew it? For your information, we only missed three days in two months.Give me what's left of our dough. I'll go to the corner and buy a few necessities.What's cheaper, Thunderbird or Night Train?Excuse me, little old lady, do you have change for a dollar?Well could you do me a favor and guard this while I go break a dollar? My wallet's locked in this machine.It's gone. I got robbed by Grandma Walton. She got my wallet, too.Come on, man, cheer up. We've been own before. I'm sure we'll land on our heads somewhere.Oh man, I'm sorry, Harry. What happened?His head fell off?I don't suppose he had a warranty...?That's it! I've had it with this ump! We don't have food, we don't have jobs, our pets' heads are falling off, we're surrounded by roving gangs of larcenous oldNo I won't calm down.What the hell are we doing here anyway, Harry? We've got to get out of this town.I'll tell you where: someplace warm, a place where the beer flows like wine, where beautiful women instinctively flock like the salmon of Capistrano. I'm talking about Aspen.That's right, Aspen.Let me ask you something: do you want to end up like Petey dead in some flea-ridden apartment, face- down on a Dear Abby column, with a soggy sunflower seed pressed against your beak? Or do you want to enjoy your life? Come on, Harry, don't let Petey's eath be in vain. Don't you see what he was saying? Spread your wings, man. he was saying? Spread your wings, man. Fly.That's bullshit. I'll drive. And what's so wrong about going someplace where we know someone who can plug us into the social pipeline?You know what I'm sick and tired of, Harry? I'm sick and tired of having to eek my way through life. I'm sick and tired of being a nobody.But most of all, I'm sick and tired of having nobody.On the other hand, maybe you're right, Harry. Maybe we should stay here and try our luck in bankruptcy court. With all those lawsuits against us, I'm sure we'll win at least one. It could be a boost to our egos.Well, we're finally doing it. Do you realize that in all the years we've known each other, this is the first time we've done this together.Taken a trip.Why'd you do that?Take your seatbelt off.Huh?Well what about the people who live around here? What if we got into an accident with one of them?Bought 'em when we filled up.This didn't come out of our travel fund. I was able to scrape up twenty- five bucks before we left. You know, so we could live in style.I sold some stuff to Billy in 4-C.That's right.Just some odds and ends.Oh, a few baseball cards, a sack of marbles, Petey, three comic books a second, are you telling me you sold my dead bird to a blind kid? Well who else was I gonna sell it to?Put your mind at ease, friend. I took care of it.According to this map, about an inch and a half.Relax. We have more than enough.And I believe I'm right, Harry.How much you wanna bet?What do you mean you don't bet?Oh, bull. I'll bet you our next meal that I can get you gambling before the day's out.I'll give you three-to-one odds. That's three feedbags if you win, against only one if you lose.Okay, five-to-one I can get you gambling before the day's out.Make it ten-to-one. Harry sticks out his hand.What's the soup du jour?Sounds tasty. I'll have a bowl.Uh-oh...You spilled the salt. That's bad luck. We're driving across the country and the last thing we need is bad luck. Quick, toss a handful of salt over your right shoulder.Because that's good luck.Or was it the left shoulder?Well if you'd stop picking fights with the locals... Wait a second. I think I just had an idea. Follow me...Excuse me, gentlemen, I'd just like to apologize for that unpleasant scene a little earlier.What I'm trying to say is, my friend and I would like to buy you guys a round of beers, just to bury the hatchet.Whatever you want, sir. I'll have the waitress send them over. Oh, and fellas hope to see you again down the road.Um, Sea Bass and the fellas offered to pick up our check. They said just add this to their tab.Well, if that guy at the table over there is Sea Bass...By the way, how far is it to Rhode Island from here?I just wish we could've seen Sea Bass's face when he got the bill.Don't worry. That fish-head is probably half-way to Providence by now.Hey, stop the car. I gotta take a whiz.But I gotta go. What am I supposed to do?I can't hold it. I'm about to explode.Are you serious?Uh-oh...The bottle's almost full and I'm still going.I can't stop once I already started, you know that. Quick, get me another bottle.Jesus, be careful! You almost went off the road.Here, hold this.Hey, I haven't gone all day.But, your honor, he's telling the truth. It's not beer.YOU WOULD, TOO...Nothing. Nothing at all.Hey, it's the only motel that charges by the hour. We can't afford anything else.Yep, this sure is the life. Cold beer, a hot tube, and fuzzy pink sheets... You know, there's only one thing that could make this moment any better.If you had a nice set of knockers.Right now I'd settle for one.What happened, Harry? Some little filly break your heart?Felcher? You mean the babe who worked for the tractor company?That's cold, Har. Give you any reason?You're it.You're it. Quitsies.Damn, you're good, Harry. Hey, didn't I tell you this trip would be a blast?See, I told you these country folks were friendly, Harry.Well the first thing we do is take a good deep breath of that famous Aspenese air.The freshest. They say on any day of the week you can smell a moose-fart ten miles away.Then we make a splash on the social scene.Harry, look the golden arches. Pull over, I'm starving. CUT TO:Look, once we drop the briefcase off to Mary, she'll be so grateful she'll plug us right into the party circuit. After that, we do a little of the skiSome bum down at unemployment.What's the matter?Yeah? So?Hey, wait a second. Hold everything.Aren't you forgetting something?Back at Mickey D's? A little matter you might've overlooked...?My change.It's a vegetable.And I happen to know it's a vegetable.Fine with me.Okay, Harry, my turn. Let 'er rip.Hmmm... full-bodied, delicate bouquet, aged to perfection will rip no fart before it's time. Come on, Marquis of Dingleberry's rules: you got ten seconds. All right. I'll say: cheese doodles, chili dog extra onions, garden salad with blue...Kit-Kat bar.Where are your manners, Harry? We have a guest.Okay, you go first.No, you go first.Hmmm, not bad...Harry Dunne, I'm surprised at you. Perhaps it's about time you brushedNo, I mean like 'an eye for an eye.' Hand me those peppers the atomic ones.More like re-location.Not really. I was just her limo river.Life is a fragile thing, Har. One minute you're chewing on a burger; the next minute you're dead meat.If you don't count that gurgling sound.Hey, relax, man, I'm just as responsible as you are we both slipped him the peppers and look at me, I on't feel guilty at all.That's ridiculous. You probably won't live to see forty.Sorry, Har. We're gonna have to hold out. Seems we misjudged our expense allocation. If we pay for a motel we won't have enough for gas.We over-leveraged.I sprung for Mr. Chili Pepper's last meal. Felt it was the least we could o after we deep-sixed him.The slob ordered a double-bacon eluxe and a chocolate malt.Drive. We've only got ten more hours. We can take turns.Um, yeah could you do it the other way around?Look, Harry, I told you what happened, now drop it.That's a low blow, man.Listen, bud, if you're trying to imply that I'm that thought look, we're almost in Colorado.Hey, I picked you up a Beef Jerky...Boy, some guys just weren't cut out for life on the road.Hey, Mr. Sleepy Head, welcome back.I'd say a good five hours, anyway.Should be. I've been averaging about ninety miles an hour all night.Boy, I'll tell you, this is one angerous highway. You wouldn't believe all the road pizza two dead ogs, a couple of rabbits, a snake and some big thing I couldn't even recognize.I hit 'em.I was thinking the same thing. That John Denver's some full of shit, huh?I must say, Des Moines sure is a pretty little town.Last night. We drove through it.Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Rise and shine. You were the one who was asleep,In our country it does, yes.I'm only human, Harry. Anybody can make a mistake.Come on, man, pull yourself together.You can't take a bus to Europe, dodo.You don't have a passport.Come on, stop being a baby about this. Okay, so we back-tracked a tad.Well it doesn't do any good having you sitting there on your butt whining about it. If we're gonna get out of this hole, we're gonna have to dig ourselves out.Where you going?You can't be serious.Thanks a lot, Mr. Perfect. Like you never screwed up. Harry suddenly STOPS IN HIS TRACKS and turns back to his friend. He seems completely rained.Got room for one more, if you still want to go to Aspen.Used car dealer. I traded the van for it. Plus I got the guy to throw in fifty bucks for gas money. Come on, man, what do you say? We still partners?Tell me something, Harry. Would you really have kept going home if I hadn't come back to get you?We were never Cub Scouts.Relax, it's empty.Isn't this wonderful? What more could a couple of single guys like us ask for?You're so materialistic. Why don't we get down to business and eliver the briefcase to Mary. Who knows, maybe she'll invite us in for tea and a strumpet or two?Um... good question.Hmmmm... You know, I don't believe I caught that either.Come to think of it, there is. It's engraved right into the leather.Samsonite spelled just like it sounds.A little. Shall we share it?Mmmm mmmm good...Hmmm... looks like an old piece of Beef Jerky.You're pathetic. Get your own.Roll up your window.Then I guess the damn anti-cold system isn't working. You really should get it fixed if we're gonna live here all winter.Right here the A/C button. I put it on full blast about an hour ago and, if anything, the car's getting colder.What are you going out there for?What are you worrying about now?Huh?Harry, calm down! You're acting like a wild animal!Sorry, doc, I can't take medicine. I'm a Christian Scientist!What are you doing?Don't do anything foolish, Harry.You're making a big mistake, Harry! I'll never forgive you for this!Harry, hold up! Things are gonna get better, I promise! In fact, I thinkNo I'm not, man look.Harry, look!Okay, here's the plan: We borrow a few bucks just a small loan from the briefcase, and we check into a cheap motel.And we'll keep track of the money we spend with IOUs.That way, whatever we borrow we can pay back.You know, as soon as we get jobs.Thanks, Barnard, but we'll find our own chicks.Tell you what you can send up, my friend how about some chow?Don't bother. Just order us one of everything.Oh, sorry. Make that two of everything. Harry smiles at this as Lloyd pulls a wad of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS out of his pocket. He rips one off and tucks it in Barnard's top pocket.And here you go, Barney. You keep us happy, we'll keep you happy.Our first IOU. Signed and dated.It's no dream, Har. We finally cracked the big time.What's the big deal? We're gonna pay it all back anyway, right?Surfboards? I thought those were beginner's skis. This suddenly makes sense to Harry.Where'd this come from?What for?Harry, how many women do you know who wear a size XXL?Enter, parlez vous!All out of Boone's Farm, huh?Guess it'll have to do, slugger, eh?Oh, one more thing: You can dispense with the 'sir' crap. Let's face it, Barney, we're all from the same mold. We just have a little more dough than you right now.Harry, it's her.Mary with the briefcase. This is her...Mary Swanson...Thanks for the lift, Barney.This should cover a couple plates.Put us down for four plates, my good man.I'm getting nervous, Harry.What are you talking about? They're educated, well-bred, charming, and sophisticated.Don't do this to me, Harry. I'm already a wreck. What if Mary oesn't like me?Two martinis, straight up. As Harry and Lloyd silently take in the party, a BEAUTIFUL RED HEAD reaches between them for a cocktail napkin, then walks away.Shut up, Harry.Yeah, well I know what you were gonna say and I'm telling you to shut up in advance.I read you like a book.You were gonna say: (in Harry's loopedAnd I would say 'shut up', because this is our chance to get in with the rich and powerful and you don't ingratiate yourself to the kind of people by acting like Ron Jeremy on Spanish Fly.Two more, please.I can't help it. This is a very important night for me.Harry, have you ever wondered why you and I never have long-term girlfriends?That was a fluke. The reason we never have long-term girlfriends is because of one thing: We're afraid of the C word.I'm talking bout commitment.Well I'm ready for commitment, Harry. The first time I laid eyes on Mary Swanson, I knew she was the one. Some things you feel in your heart, other things you feel in your groin. This girl makes me feel it all in the heart.Oh shit, there she is.She's gonna think I'm some kind of psycho when she realizes how far I came just to see her.And then what? She'll take it back and that'll be it. I'm a nobody.Wait a second, I have an idea. You go over and introduce yourself. That way you can build me up so when I come along I won't have to brag about myself. Tell her I'm good-looking and I'm rich and I have a rapist's wit.Please Harry, I'm appealing to you as one loser to another. Just build me up and then give me a signal to come over. Please.How come you didn't call me over?Wha... you... I... it's... I love you, man. I love you!This calls for a toast!You're gonna be my best man, Har, I mean it. It was always between you and my future wife's brother, but you just earned a seat at the head table, pal.Mrs. Christmas... Mary Christmas... Mrs. Mary Christmas. YouImpossible. I know my type when I see it. Now let me get this straight, she wants me to meet her at the Avalanche Bar and Grill on Main Street?Time out. Where are going ressed like that.You mean you're gonna go out in public dressed in tights?But you can see the outline of your who-who.Turn sideways.Actually, it's just a tiny little lump. No one will ever notice.I'm meeting someone. Mind if I wait at the bar?Maybe some other time.Excuse me, you wouldn't happen to know a Mary Swanson, would you?Do you know where she lives?Some best man.Believe me, it was the right place. I don't know, Har, maybe she just had second thoughts.What?Do ya think...?I just figured she was a raging alcoholic.I knew there was an explanation. And here I thought she was standing me up.Will you join me in a good luck toast before you head out?Pretty snazzed out for a movie, aren't you?I see.To my friend Harry the matchmaker.Hi. Don't you remember me?South Bend. I drove you to the airport last week.You remembered.I brought you your briefcase You left it at the airport so I picked it up for you.Yeah, it's back at my hotel room. Come on, let's take a ride. I'll give it to you...So anyway, as soon as I got to town I tried to look you up but I idn't know your last name.'Course I have it. When Lloyd Christmas drives a woman to the airport, he makes sure she gets all her luggage, no matter what he has toWell... no... I mean, you know, there were other reasons... Actually, yeah, I guess I did.Look, Mary, I know this may seem a little sudden but I've given it a lot of thought: You're the woman I've been waiting for my whole life, and I'm not ashamed to admit it -- --Please, let me finish. I'm crazy about you. I've never felt this way about anyone. You make it so easy for me to tell you my innermost desires. Listen to me, I feel like a schoolboy again. A schoolboy who desperately wants to make sweet, sweet love to you.Mary... I desperately want to make love to a schoolboy.No, that's not what Imeant. I meant... I really like you, Mary. I like you a lot.I'm gonna ask you something flat out and I want you to answer me honestly: What do you think the chances are of a girl like you and a guy like me ending up together?--I asked you to be honest, Mary.--Come on, give it to me straight. I rove a long way to see you, the least you can do is level with me. What are my chances?You mean not good, like one out of a hundred?So you're telling me there's a chance?Husband?Who are you?Uh-oh.Uh, sir, about the briefcase, I want you to know, my friend Harry and I have every intention of reimbursing you.That's as good as money, sir. Those are our IOUs. You can add them up yourself. Every penny's accounted for.Now don't do anything hasty, man.Yeah, we used to be best friends.Me a backstabber? You got a lot of nerve. I saw her first.But you knew how crazy I was about her.What are you talking about?Look... I was gonna tell you about that. It was gonna be mentioned at the reading of my will. I swear, you can ask my lawyer.You said it, pal. Maybe we're not as good friends as we thought we were.I mean, if one beautiful girl could rip us apart like this, then it seems our friendship isn't worth a damn. Maybe we should call it quits right here.Mary's married, Harry.No, I'll go first, Harry. I was the one who got you into this mess.Jesus Christ! You killed my best friend, you bastard!Harry! You're alive!You gotta be kidding.But how did you...?She's something, ain't she, Har?Guess we have to admit it, she was too good for us.Look, we just wanted to say that we appreciate all you did for us during our stay.Well, anyway, thanks again for everything.This joint is a little out of our budget, Barney.You know what, Barney, I think we'll take out chances down the road.I say we head due

You know the rules: No pushing, no humping, and no sniffing heinies...The same reason you're not on a leash, sir because it's demeaning and it chafes like hell.You kids stay right here...Hey, wait a minute!I got fired again.None taken. Were you shitcanned, too?Why'd you quit?Why didn't you wait and see if your suspicions were well-founded?You know, the thing that really chaps my ass is that I just spent my life savings turning my van into a poodle. The alarm alone cost me two hundred.What are you talking about? It's only six years old.What's with the briefcase?Huh?What's in it?Why not?We don't have any friends.Can't recognize them. Could be student loan thugs again, or the IRS, or maybe somebody pissed off about that case of Girl Scout cookies you bounced a check on.Well, whoever they are, they look serious. One of them's even wearing plaid.Yeah, and that was because of a blizzardCome on, Stan. I'm sure you can find something else for us. How about another crack at that Suicide Hotline?Get Robitussin it's a better buzz.Where's the booze?It gets worse, Lloyd. My parakeet Petey he's... he's dead.His head fell off.Yeah, he was pretty old.Nah, I bought him used.Okay, calm down.Yeah, and go where?Aspen?I don't know, Lloyd, the French are assholes.What are you talking about, Lloyd? His head fell off. Wait a second, I know what you're up to. You just wanna go to Aspen so you can find that girl who lost her briefcase and you need me to drive you there.I don't know, Lloyd. I think we should stay here, hunt for jobs, and keep saving money for the worm store. I'm getting a little sick and tired of always running from creditors.Come on, Lloyd. Give us a kiss.Petey, I made a promise to you once, man... ...and I'll be damned if I can remember what it was.Been run out of town?What?Because we just cleared the danger zone.Don't you know anything, Lloyd? Ninety percent of all accidents happen within five miles of home. We've already traveled 6.3 miles.Where'd you get those?Lloyd, I thought we agreed to confer on all expenditures. We're on a tight budget, remember?Where'd you get twenty-five extra bucks?You mean the blind kid?What did you sell him, Lloyd?Specifically?But Lloyd, Petey didn't even have a head.How far have we gone?Shit. We're gonna need a smaller map or we'll never get there. We don't have enough gas money.I believe you're wrong, Lloyd.I still say wrong, Lloyd.I don't bet.I mean I don't gamble, you know that. Never have and never will.There's no way, Lloyd. You can't do it.You're wasting your money, Lloyd. I already told you, I don't gamble.Sorry, pal, no way.You got yourself a bet, sucker!Actually, this chocolate milk isn't mixed very well. Could you please bring me a spoon?What's the matter?What for?It was a terrible accident, Sir. Believe me, I would never do anything to offend a man of your size. Please accept my most sincere apology.Um... the thought had crossed my mind.Nah, you go ahead.Perfect. I'm out eight bucks and I still haven't eaten.Lloyd, what are you doing? You know we can't afford to buy them drinks.Oh, and put these on there, too.I hope we never have to.I hope so.Are you crazy? I'm not stopping now. What if they figure out we went the other way. They'll be on us in no time.Hold it.Well... just take a whiz in an empty beer bottle. There's a couple on the floor in the back seat.Yes, I'm serious. I'm not stopping now. We could get killed. Lloyd SIGHS. He takes an EMPTY BEER BOTTLE from the back seat and UNZIPS his fly. Suddenly we hear a PEEING SOUND. Then:What's the matter?Well stop going.I'm sorry, Lloyd. I'm doing the best I can.What are you, a goddamn camel?Huh?No, it's a Cardigan! But thanks for noticing!Jesus, what is this, the fashion police?Yes, sir, we had a little... ifficulty in the car.No, sir.Oh, that's nothing, sir.Sir, I wouldn't TROOPER --You'd keep your mouth shut if you knew what was good for you.I don't know, Lloyd, I feel a little sleazy staying here when we're not even engaged.What's that?That's two things, Lloyd.I don't know, Lloyd, these places just don't do it for me. Brings back too many memories.Nah, it was a girl. Fraida Felcher. We stayed at a place like this once No-Tell Motel out on Route 31.The same. We had this incredibly romantic time. Boy, I thought we'd be together forever. Then about a week later, right out of the blue, she sends me a John Deere letter.I called her up and she gave me some crap about me not listening to her enough or something like that. I wasn't really paying attention.Thing that really hurts is I think she was seeing another guy. Never id find out who.You're it.Anti-quitsies. You're it. Quitsies. No anti-quitsies. No startsies.Refresh my memory on something, Lloyd: what exactly do we do when we get to Aspen?Fresh, huh?Wow... talk about paradise. And after we're finished breathing, what next, Lloyd?Thanks.About this social scene how do you expect a couple mutts like us to make a splash in the land of pedigrees when we don't even have any money?Where'd you hear that?I don't know, Lloyd.Money does terrible things to people. I mean, we could lose our friendship.What?What?I think this guy's in trouble. Why on't you pull over.It's a fruit.I'm telling you, it's a fruit.Tell you what, why don't we leet an impartial judge decide.Hey, Mr. Mentalino, settle our bet: Are jelly beans fruits or vegetables?And...?You're the best, man. Okay, my turn.Come on, Mr. Mentalino. Let one fly. It's only a buck.I'll do one if you will.No, you go first.Yeah, more tingly than hot.That really wasn't very polite of him, was it? Maybe we should loosen the screws of his chair.You mean like 'turn the other cheek?'Here he comes.The briefcase isn't even ours. Some lady just left it at the airport. We're bringing it back to her.Hey, you okay, man? It was just a goof.I can't believe it...But he blamed me. You heard him. Those were his last words.Small comfort coming from a man who sells dead birds to blind kids. Don't you get it, Lloyd. I've got a ead guy pissed at me. His restless spirit will probably haunt me for the next seventy-five years.Oh yeah. Wow. What a relief.Let's get off and crash at a motel before I crash into one. I need a crib fast.What happened to the dough?On what?Wait a second one burger put us over budget?Oh. So what are we gonna do?Come on, wake up. You pay, I'll pump.Skis, huh?Great.They yours?Both of 'em?Cool.That's a lot of luggage for a little vacation.Here, this is a little loose.Allow me...Look, um, maybe when I get to Aspen we can meet up... you know, for hot chocolate or something.Look, why don't you just tell it to me, I've got a good memory.Positive please hurry.You've got some serious explaining to o, young man.Sure thing, Lloyd. I promise not to mention another word about you being in a bathroom stall with a six-foot, five-inch trucker with his pants own.Not at that height it's not.I think it's about time we pull over and change seats. I've been driving for nine straight hours I don't have the energy to start a new state.How long have I been out?Great. We must be getting real close, huh?Good man.That's awful. Did you see them get hit or were they already lying there?Funny. I expected the Rocky Mountains to be a little rockier than this.Yeah, it really is. Wait a minute when did you visit Des Moines?What are you talking about? You were snoring like a baby when we went through Des Moines.Uh, Lloyd, refresh my memory: Doesn't the sun rise in the east and set in the west?Then perchance you can explain to me why the sun is in our face at 7:30 in the morning when we're heading west.You know, I got half a mind to just jump on the bus to Europe and say goodbye to your ugly mug forever.Oh yeah? Why not?A tad? Lloyd, you drove almost a sixth of the way across the country in the wrong direction. Now we don't have enough money to get to Aspen, we on't have enough money to get home, we don't have enough to eat, we don't have enough to sleep!You know, you're absolutely right, Lloyd.Home. I'm walking home.Why not? We're probably only five miles away.Look, man... I'm sorry. I never should have let you talk me into this in the first place. You've got a good reason to goo a beautiful girl's waiting for you. But let's face it, Lloyd, there's nothing waiting for me in Aspen. There's nothing waiting for me anywhere.Where'd you find this baby?Well let me put it this way, Lloyd: Do you remember when we were Cub Scouts and we got lost in the woods uring that blizzard? We huddled together all night, and we made an oath that if we ever got out of there alive we'd never ever leave each other's side again. Do you remember that?Exactly.What the hell is this? There's a coffin in the back!I don't give a shit. I'm not driving anywhere with a casket. You know I'm superstitious calm down. We'll dump it off first chance we get.How about food and shelter?Jolly good idea, chap. And where oes the lovely young lady reside?Well what's her last name? We'll look it up in the phone book.What about the briefcase, Lloyd? There must've been a name on it, right?What is it?Any soup left?Please.Hey, you got something stuck in your front teeth. Lloyd picks a small speck out of his mouth and studies it.Wanna split it?I'm freezing my ass off, Lloyd.It is rolled up.What anti-cold system?To warm up.I'm worried about how you're gonna survive the pummeling I'm about to give you.Get over here and take your medicine, Lloyd!Something I should've done a long time ago. This stupid thing has been the root of our problems all along.Foolish? This is the most sensible thing I've done in years. I'm gonna toss this goddamn curse right into that river. Lloyd starts to follow after Harry.You're bluffing.That's a filling, you liar!I used to have a life! A miserable one, but a life, nonetheless!Sounds good.We'll be meticulous right down to the last penny.Absolutely. We're good for it.It'll come right out of our first paycheck.Oh. Then go ahead and send thim up. What are their names?One of everything? Lloyd...Oh god, it's really true. Last night I thought I might've been dreaming.And it was so simple. All it took was somebody else's money.You know, Lloyd, I think you might've gone a little overboard with the spending today.Sure, but do you really think you needed to buy those two surfboards?Ahhh. I was wondering why you had those bindings put on them.I bought it.I like the feel of it against my skin... ...I mean, you know, when a woman's wearing it.Look, leave me alone. I'm rich now. I'm supposed to have a few eccentricities.Cocktail hour has commenced!Hey, later on what do you say we...?Lloyd... you okay?Who?Come on, Cinderella, it's time to get you ready for the ball...I'm kind of hungry, Lloyd. What if we want seconds?relax, Lloyd. These people are just like you and me.So what? We can be sophistica holy shit, would you look at the fun bags on that hose hound.Look, let's just go saddle up to the bar and down a couple bowls of loudmouth soup. A little booze'll bring back that old Lloyd Christmas over-confidence.I didn't say anything.How do you know what I was gonna say?Okay, if you read me like a book then what was I gonna say?Lloyd, I've never seen you this uptight. You've gotta chill out.What are you talking about? I went out with Fraida Felcher for two and a half weeks.That's crazy. We live for the C word.Oh.Wow. You weren't kidding, Lloyd. She's an angel. Well, what are you waiting for? Get over there and talk to her.You have her briefcase she's gonna be thrilled to see you.Look, man, you just drove two thousand miles to see this girl. Don't quit on the last fifty feet.I can't tell her you're good looking, Lloyd she's got eyes.All right. But you're gonna owe me a big one for this.Nice set of hooters you got there.The owls. They're beautiful.Well, I used to have a parakeet, but my main area of expertise is canines that's dogs to the layperson.Oh, I've trained them, bathed them, clipped them; I've even bred them.Nah, mostly just doggie-style. But one time we successfully mated a Bulldog and a Shitzu.Yeah. We called it a Bullshit. Just a little breeder joke.Anyway, the real reason I came over is because I want to introduce you to a friend of mine.Harry Dunne. Pleasure meeting you both.You were?Really?Anyway, about my friend you doing anything tomorrow, Mr. Dunne? Because I believe Mary's looking for somebody to hit the slopes with. Whuh?Oh, I don't know. You see, my friend your friends for one day. You and Mary will have a ball.Um... well... I don't know. You see, the thing is... sure.Relax, you're golden. I got you a ate with her tomorrow.Okay, get a grip, Lloyd. You're making a scene.I think we've done enough hobnobbing, Lloyd.Sounds nice, Lloyd, but don't you think you may be jumping the gun a little? I mean, who knows, when you get to know her, you may find out she's not your type.That's what she said. Ten o'clock sharp.I, uh, thought while you were making your love connection I'd try my luck on the slopes.These aren't tights. They're fashionable Euro-trash ski trousers.Really?You're right. I can't go out dressed like this.Sorry I'm late. It's a bitch driving a clutch with these things.You take the first run alone. I'm gonna loosen up down here.Glorious.Why not?Thanks.Oh, look... frost.Sure. I do this all the time... CUT TO:See ya at the bottom...Hi. Say, kids, you wouldn't happen to have a cup of warm water, would you?I'm fine, I'm fine. It'll come off.My pleasure, Mary.Better make it quarter to eight. I've got a few things to take care of first.Mary Dunne... Mrs. Mary Dunne... Got a nice ring to it.It doesn't make any sense, Lloyd. She told me ten o'clock sharp. Are you sure you went to the right bar?I have a hard time believing that, Lloyd. The girl said she couldn't wait to see you again.Wait a minute...It just occurred to me. She must've meant ten o'clock at night.Of course! Why would she have you meet her at a bar at ten in the morning?Boy, aren't we a couple of beauties?That'll teach you to jump to conclusions. Anyway, since you have your night allSure thing, pal. Whatever you think will help your chances.Uh... it's for mature audiences. I on't wanna chance getting turned away at the door.Mmmmm...Be right out.Huh?Um, no, I was just... shaving.Yeah! I was running a little late. Thought this would save time.Come on, flush, you bastard...Uh... just cleaning my teeth. Give me a minute, Mary, I'll be right with you.But Mary --Great...It's all Kharma, Harry. You screw your best friend over and it's gonna come back to haunt you, plain and simple...You...? What are you doing here?Lloyd, are you home? We've gotta talk, man. I have a serious confession to make.Oh good, you found her. I'll just leave you two kids alone.Until he turned into a backstabber.Hey, I couldn't help it if she found me irresistable.Yeah, and you knew how crazy I was about Fraida Felcher, but that didn't stop you, did it?Don't deny it, Lloyd. Fraida told me the whole sordid story.Well I guess we both learned a little something about each other, didn't we?Guess not.Just tell me where to sign, bud.I wouldn't pull that trigger if I were you.Except you're forgetting one minor etail.If you kill us, you'd be killing yourself.You see, philosophers believe that we're all really just tiny pieces of one huge universal being. In other words, I am you and you are me, so if you were to kill us you'd be committing suicide, you unenlightenedHusband? What husband?Kill her. The bitch should've told him she was married back at the airport. It would've saved us a lot of trouble.No, wait, do me first. I'm the one who stole your girl, Lloyd. I eserve it.She grabbed me down in the lobby and explained what was up. They slapped this on me and gave me a gun.Yeah, about that dough...You were right, Lloyd. She was efinitely worth the trip.Hey, Barney...And we're, um, sorry about the money we gave you turning out to be phony.I dunno. I'm sure we'll find a trailer camp somewhere to call home.Are you on the level?Since we're finished elbow-rubbing, what next, lloyd?Now you're talking my language.
