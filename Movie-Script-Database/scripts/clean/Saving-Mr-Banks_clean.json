{"Saving-Mr-Banks": {"TRAVERS": {"raw_line": "--Like something is brewing, about to begin-- The shadow's direction becomes purposeful - taking us down through the clouds, whipping us on the wind towards a small town in the distance.--Can't put me finger on what lies--But I feel what's to happen, allExcuse me ma'am, have you seen my daughter? I was quite sure I had left her around here somewhere! Ginty giggles.Her name is Helen, no, Shirley, erm- - goodness! I've quite forgotten! Could it be Prunella?Pamela?You're right still doesn't sound quite-- I'm sure I have a special name for her--Why, thank you ma'am! Ginty it is of course!Gosh! So it is! Well, thank goodness for that! I was positive I was going to be beheaded for losing Her Highness The Royal Princess Ginty Mc Featherfluffy!Never. I promise. I will never lose you! He swings her up onto his shoulders and gallops off through the park, neighing like a horse.Hurry now! We mustn't be late! The adventure is about to begin!Who needs a carriage my love? A stroll is a gift! Everybody ready?Come along my team! We mustn't miss the train.Walking bus! The family get into line, one behind the other, Travers in the lead.Don't forget Andrew! Ginty takes Andrew's leash, her own case and somehow helps her sister too.Ready? And off we go! Passersby tut and shake their heads at the noisy display as Travers and the girls march down the street.Left, right, left, right! Coming through! Margaret stays for a beat, longingly taking in and storing a picture of the home she leaves behind.A palace! Complete with mighty steed.We'll build beautiful memories here my angel. Margaret offers him a trusting smile.--in this house you get to share a bedroom! Margaret looks at the surrounding area, there's simply nothing but barren land and red dust for miles.Ginty. He kisses her cheek and gently lifts her from his lap.I'll make us a good life.Ahhh, there's my girl. The horse moves up to her.That's it Albert. Give Ginty a smooch. There's a good boy, give her a little smooch. The velvety muzzle of the horse \"smooches\" Ginty's neck and ear as Travers climbs down from the nag.Poor old Albert; he's your secret uncle you know? But a miserable, horrid witch turned him into a nag.Because she hated the sound of his laugh.We have to teach the witch how to be happy again.I'm not quite sure darling.Do you want to know what it feels like to fly Ginty? She nods. He hauls himself onto Albert, leans down and swings Ginty up so she is facing him.You trust me? She nods and wraps her arms around him looking backwards over his shoulder. He grips her firmly around the waist and she spreads her arms.Gee up, Albert. Yah! Travers kicks the horse into a trot, then into a canter, he points a finger in the air as if shooting for the stars.Yah! Ginty squeals with delight.For you my dear! Swish! Which kind of kisses do you prefer Gintamina? Swoosh! Scratchy ones or silky ones?And Mr Belhatchett has complained that I opened his stupid bank five minutes late has he? Hahaaa! Time's Money, Goff, y'know! Time's money my man! The clerk laughs nervously.Bell Hatchett! Beautiful hatchet. That's what it means. And I suppose if the poor dumb lambs on his downs, are five minutes late with their calving, or they don't drop dead on schedule when he wants a roast, he takes to them with the business end of his beautiful hatchet. Travers wields a glinting letter opener in the air, stabbing piles of papers, filing cabinets, desks.There, whack! That'll teach you for not dropping your bairns on schedule. Whack! Whack! Whack! Travers looks at the figure standing outside his door and his eyes widen.Whack. Whoops! Mr Belhatchett! Allow me to-- Travers pushes the door open to reveal Ginty at his side and is felled.Ginty!Sweet thing! What are you doing here? Ginty looks up at Belhatchett and the manager.Ice cream day! Yes! I did! What kind of father am I?Ah, yes it does seem that--Ice cream is so rare because it only comes from Siberian cows. Did you know that?!We share a Celtic soul, you and I. This world is just an illusion, Ginty old girl. As long as we hold that thought dear, they can't break us. Money, money, money. Don't you buy into it Ginty! It'll bite you on the bot! How did we end up here eh? Look at it. Barren. Breathless. Get as far away from this place as possible my love. Find yourself a patch of green.I couldn't stop thinking about my beautiful girls on this beautiful day in this beautiful place and I thought to hell with it! And what do we say about beauty ladies?Buts are for goats my love! He dips her and smooches her.I'll put in extra hours tomorrow.That's no hen! That's Aunt Ellie, your mother's horrendiferous sister!I'll wash them again my love! Margaret look at the dirty sheets and shrugs. The kids run after their father squealing and giggling as the poor little hen runs for its life. Even the dog joins in, Margaret goes to retrieve the discarded jacket and sees a whisky bottle protruding from the inside pocket, she slips it back inside - out of sight, out of mind.Go Sergeant Ginty! Fell the beast! Ginty dives on the hapless bird, who pecks her soundly and scarpers. It's chaos. Travers, the girls, the dog and the evasive hen running into each other, falling over each other, cursing and laughing.Oh she's a foul fowl!--Meg sweet, I had a throat scratch-God no! No. I can endure. I will endure. For the girl's sake-- Just, please-- not Ellie.The world is an illusion Ginty.Ahh the Countess Mary Sparklestick! Pray tell me, what are you concentrating so hard on?Really!? Fabulous!Indeed! I can see the feathers sprouting as we speak! Margaret steps out onto the veranda, takes one look at her husband and knows he is drunk.She's laying!(urgent, his voiceDon't.Mr Belhatchett. Randolph looks at Travers, then at Travers shaking hands, his family nod and move on. Margaret looks upset by this.Oh, for Gods' sake, Meg, stop whinnying like an old nag will you? Margaret is aghast at being spoken to like that in public but she keep her mouth shut. Ginty notices Travers eyes stray towards the refreshments tent.Meet you there in a blink of an eye!Indeed, a published poet-- She takes a deep breath and moves forward, grabs Travers hand.In a moment, my princess. I'm talking.Not now Biddy!Ginty! Shoo! Devastated, Ginty doesn't know what to do, she pulls at his shirt sleeve again.Good afternoon, distinguished guests, our biggest supporter Mr Randolph Belhatchett and his lovely wife, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls! Randolph looks at Travers with displeasure and then at one of the bank staff.I'm honoured to be here on behalf of the Belhatchett Bank of Australia. Shortly, it will be my very pleasant duty to present the awards to our young performers. But before I begin, I'd like to say a very few words to our very youngest citizens about the role of the - er, the Bank in our community. Ginty allows herself to breathe. So far, so good.Bankruptcies! Debtor sales! Opportunities! All manner of private enterprise! Shipyards! The Mercantile! Collieries! Tanneries! Incorporations! Amalgamations! Banks!Uhmm. Thank you kindly. Thanking you. Now-- what, what am I doing next? Oh! It's a marvellous idea to encourage children to open accounts. My daughter, the Princess Ginty-- she's-- uh. How old are you? Come up here. Ginty - what? Me? Ginty glances to her mother and then, on trembling legs, makes her way forward and up the stairs onto the dais. Margaret watches, growing uneasy.Ginty has a bank account-- and that's good. Give her a drink! The audience is shocked.I shall return in just a moment to present the awards. But right now I must-- relieve myself. Gasps from the audience. Margaret - dying.Give us your shoulder, Ginty, will you? I'm busting. There's a good girl. Father and daughter walk towards the edge of the stage, Travers leaning on Ginty's shoulder. The shameful glare of Allora burning into them.I don't suppose there's any more you can give me for the pain? The doctor shakes his head at Travers wanton greed for more.Be a darling Ginty my old pal! Help father out won't you? Ginty is wary.In my washroom-- there's a bottle of medicine that father needs--Godammit! Nervous, hopeful, Ginty withdraws a folded sheet of paper from her pocket.It's hardly Yeats, is it? Ginty is devastated. But more than this there's a hardening in her small face, a sense of disillusionment that so far she's held in check. Here are the first signs of the Pamela to come.The Aunt.Look at you-- all ship shape. Travers reaches up a shaking hand and musses up Ginty's perfectly plaited hair.Never. I promise. I will never lose you.--Like something is brewing, about to begin-- And further and further--Can't put me finger on what lies inBut I feel what's to happen, all", "clean_line": "like brewing begin

{"raw_line": "The cherry blossomsMrs Travers.I shan't be going. Diarmuid buries his face in his hands.I've changed my mind.With all due respect Mr Russell I am on very good terms with my own faculty and exceedingly confident in its decision making capabilities. Diarmuid's shoulders visibly sag, he lets out a long frustrated breath.Why in the world are you speaking to me as if I am a neonate?He'll what? Sue? He is most welcome to every penny I don't have.I know what he's going to do to her- - she'll be cavorting and twinkling! Careening towards a happy ending like a kamikaze--Use her to pay my bills? If I believed in a hell I'd be sitting in its waiting room--I fired her. Diarmuid shakes his head, sighs.It's just as well. It seems I can't afford her anymore anyway! Pamela looks to the ceiling, breathes.Of course not Polly! Pamela huffs, digs her heel into the rug.Los Angeles.Yet!Oh I must, must I?I have final say?And if I don't like what they are doing to her?I'm perfectly capable thank you. The flight attendant tries to help anyway.They've used all the space; so greedy. She glares at the people around her.I don't want it up there. I want it here, in the corresponding holding area for my assigned seat!Jolly good. Pamela gives her a watery smile and takes the seat next to the window, she looks out at the tarmac. She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, opens her eyes again and tucks her feet tidily together. She folds her hands neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead.Oh does he indeed? She approaches the uniformed driver who bursts into a beaming smile.Mrs.I'm perfectly capable of-- Oh, nevermind. Ralph ushers Pamela through the doors--Don't be preposterous. Pamela sniffs the air.It smells. Like----chlorine and sweat. Ralph chuckles.It's dreadful.It's not Mrs P.L. It's just Mrs-- Oh, it's so hot.Unpack?Young man, if it is your wish to handle ladies garments I suggest you take employment in a launderette. The porter has no idea what to say, he hovers at the door.Yes? His eyes flick to his empty palm and back to Pamela. She closes the door on him.Odd. She turns and for the first time takes in--Oh my. --The LUDICROUS suite she has been assigned; it is opulent beyond imagine but it's classy decor has been rather diminished by the array of Disney gifts splattered across every surface of the room.Oh no, no, no. Disney Flowers, Disney champagne, Disney exotic fruit baskets, Disney chocolates, Disney posters, cuddly Donald, Pluto and Minnie toys and - taking up the entire bed - the BIGGEST stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable. Imagine it. Nope.This won't do. She throws open the balcony doors for fresh air and is greeted with dry arid heat, dust, dazzling sunlight--Good riddance. She breathes a sigh of relief and closes the balcony doors.Good Lord. Pamela drops her bags, grabs Mickey and places him on the floor, facing the wall.There. Pamela is restless, she looks around the room, stands in front of a full length mirror, admiring herself. She turns her face slightly to catch it at its best angle. She leans forward and explores the contours of her face, surprisingly unlined for a woman of her years. She smiles, full of vanity.Now, really! Flatterer! Silly girl. She turns her attention away from the mirror and picks up a remote control staring at it with bemusement. She points it at the television hitting random buttons until suddenly the TV bursts into life.Oh! She clicks again, the TV goes off, again and it's on. A housewife advertises dish soap with glee, as if dish soap is the greatest thing ever invented.Soap for the brains. She changes the channel and stares blankly at a man on a black and white screen. It takes a moment before she realizes that staring back at her is the charming, moustached, kindly face of WALTER ELIAS DISNEY on The Wonderful World of Disney Show. Pamela raises an eyebrow--Well, well-- There you are.Off! That's how we deal with you.It's not Mrs, it's-- Oh, why do I bother? We're just not going to get it right are we?Will it be the same driver every day?You say it like you're surprised. Like the sun is particular about whom it appears for. It seems you think that I am responsible for it's miraculous dawning every day. For goodness sake, it's California!(as much to herself asSad is entirely the wrong emotion. I shan't bother explaining why;The rain brings life!Be quiet!It is so discomfiting to hear a perfect stranger use my first name. Mrs Travers. Please. The Sherman's look at each other. Uh oh.Co-script-writer. I shall certainly be having my say Mr. DiGraydi.If indeed we ever sign off on a script. Bob and Dick flash each other a look. What the fu ?Poppins.Mary Poppins. Never ever just Mary. A pleasure to meet you, though I fear we shan't be acquainted for too long.These books simply do not lend themselves to chirping and prancing. No. Certainly not a musical. Now, where is Mister Disney? I'd very much like to get this started and finished as briskly as is humanly possible.No thank you.No one likes a show off. Pamela takes herself off in the direction of a building.I am perfectly capable of walking. A couple of Disney characters bounce up to the golf cart, waving brightly. Goofy opens his arms to Pamela for a hug and she recoils in horror.Shoo! Go away! The characters stop bouncing and Di Gradi gives them a nod meaning `beat it'.Ghastly. Bob and Dick Sherman are in shock.Would you let Mister Disney know I have arrived please? Dolly loses her smile at the terse tone, nods curtly and picks up the phone.You may. Whether I heed it or not will be another matter entirely.Oh! He squeezes her tight and then lets go. Pamela struggles to compose herself, she hasn't been that close to a man in decades!Hum-- ah. It's an honour, Mister Disney. Disney winces.That wouldn't be appropriate. He turns a photo of his daughters - Diane and Sharon - to face Pamela.A pot of tea would be most welc--What a charming story.About your daughters.Children grow up.Gotcha indeed! Mister Disney, if you have dangled then it is at the end of a rope you have fashioned for yourself.I was quite clear when you approached me the first time that she wasn't for sale and clear again when you approached me a year later and clear again when you approached me every annum for the subsequent 18 years. Honestly, I feel corralled, ensnared--My name, if you please, is MRS Travers.Well, that's very honourable of youYes, this singing, I am glad you've come to that. (addressing his teaThat's right. Now the tea-- He picks up the pot again and pours the tea.And a spoonful of sugar. He stirs.You don't mean for this film to be a musical?No.No. She takes a sip, he waits anxiously to see if his tea is any good.Not bad. No, Mister Disney, Mary Poppins does not sing.When?Those aren't songs! They're recitations. She is not a giddy woman, she does not jig! Singing is frivolous and wholly unnecessary for a governess, an educatress. No. It would just ruin it. Walt is baffled. He takes a sip of tea, it's disgusting, he spits it back into his cup surreptitiously, then coughs loudly. Pamela's jaw drops.I won't have her turned into one of your silly cartoons. Walt takes a sharp breath on `silly' and then plasters the smile back on.If you're the King of England then you shan't exist and knowing the little of you I do; I shouldn't think you would like that very much.Come to think of it. That's a song I wouldn't object to.Yes. He's not sure if she's playing with him.Quite right. She extricates her hand.Diarmuid.A live action film. No animation.I'd like that on tape.Your promise-- and all the discussions we have here-- on tape.Ah there you are.Well then! She stands up and smooths down her skirt.Shall we begin? He holds out his hand for her to shake.Let's see if that's at all possible. Pamela gets up, smooths down her skirt, snorts at a picture of Disney in a silly hat astride a model train and purposefully strides out of the room, a smile across her face that Disney does not see.(peering around a vase atWe could save a starving country with benefaction from this room alone! Ugh, It's so vulgar. She gets up and moves the giant bouquet of flowers off the table and plops it on top of Dick's piano. Bob moves it from the piano to the floor.And these are beautiful blooms butchered for our visual and nasal enjoyment when we could have just as easily gone to the window, looked out and gazed upon them happily minding their own business and very much still alive. Bob hasn't a clue what to say. Pamela smoothes down her skirt and re-takes her seat. Everybody waits. Pamela flicks her eyes at the tape recorder which Don duly turns on.Let us begin. She perches her glasses on her nose and raises an eyebrow at the cover of her script - \"Walt Disney's Mary Poppins.\"Hm. A rustling of papers and one or two uneasy glances as the men, too, open their scripts.Ah, I see, an abbreviation.Yes, I do think it's best. I've the most practise. Readings of my books you know? Anyway--Yes. That's good, that can stay.--Though I do think we should say number 17, instead of just 17, yes? It's proper.I will see it. She makes a note in her script and looks to the others who are dumbstruck.Write it down, write it down, chop chop. Don makes the note and is ready to move on but Pamela is staring at Dick and Bob. They dutifully pick up their pencils and note their scripts too.Is that on the tape? Don glances towards the swirling tape recorder and nods.Good-- onwards. They are interrupted by DOLLY carrying a new tray of refreshments.Is this a joke?Do you think you are a comedienne?Unbelievable. Pamela shakes her head but decides to ignore Dolly and carry on.Scene One. Exterior. Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane. London. Day.Bert, a one-man band-- The rumour is that this is to be your Mister Van Dyke is it?Hmmm, we'll see about that. He's totally wrong, totally and utterly.Dick Van Dyke? Robert, my dear, Olivier is one of the greats, Burton, Guinness - greats without question. (speaking loudly into theNo no no no no no no. Dolly winces on everyone's behalf and leaves the room.Responstable is not a word.Well, un-make it up. Dick quickly hides the next set of sheet music entitled:I've a thought! I've always liked Ta Ra Ra Boom De Ay. Now, that would be a wonderful song for the film! Oh! And Admiral Boom could sing it! Do you see? Dick's fingers crunch the piano keys.Irresponstable.Nobody walks.(refusing him theNo, no, no. Goodness no.The Banks house doesn't look like that! My house is a terraced house with a pink door, white bricked with a crack in the gable. The window frames are lead-lined and the flower boxes grow pink nasturtiums to go with the pinkIt's too grand! The Banks family - they're normal, everyday sort of people. This isn't normal. It isn't everyday! They're not aristocrats!Why in the world have you made Mrs Banks a silly suffragette?Quite possibly, looking back. Dick mouths `oh my god!'Are you calling Mrs Banks neglectful?Being a mother is a job. A very difficult job and one that not everybody is up to, that not everybody should have taken on in the first place! The boys see that Pamela is talking about something meaningful to her and they begin to soften for a brief moment, until--I will NOT have her called Cynthia! Absolutely not. It feels unlucky. Dick makes a curly wurly cuckoo sign at Bob.No it should be something warm, a bit sexy. They all nearly choke at the word `sexy' coming out of her mouth.How about Mavis?Prudence?Winifred!Yes, that's because it's very good. She comes to the next sketch and stops abruptly in front of it, a split second of utter confusion crosses her face.This isn't Mr Banks? She turns to face Don and the boys.This isn't him.He has a set of moustaches!I told the illustrator I didn't like the facial hair but she chose to ignore me. This is MY film and this time around I shall have MY way.Why? Everyone shrugs, they don't know why.He didn't, he doesn't, Mr Banks is clean shaven! Bob buries his face in his hands and let's out a long, loud, unashamed moan.You can wait outside! She points at the door, ordering him out with her finger. Bob is literally stunned. Dick stifles a laugh.I shan't say it again Robert. Bob storms out of the room slamming the door and from behind it we hear:Hardly surprising. Pamela smiles sweetly.Can I expect anymore drama from anyone else?Swish. And again.Swoosh.Stop! Stop! Stop! What on earth are you talking about? Supercali--? Supercali-- or whatever the infernal thing is!Well I always know what to say. The slamming of a piano lid. Dolly pushes the door open with her foot.If you so much as step one foot in here with that tray I shall scream! One cannot live on cake alone!I've simply gone off the colour. Their mouths are agape.You did say I was to have final say did you not?And?I understand your predicament Mr Disney, I do. I just-- hm-- I don't know what it is, I'm just suddenly very anti-red. I shan't be wearing it ever again. Disney comes and sits on the table in front of Pam and locks eyes with her.I took you at your word Mr Disney and it seems my first stipulation has been denied. There will be many more, so-- perhaps we should just call it quits and I should hand you back these? She takes the rights agreement out of her bag and offers it to him. Disney smiles at Pamela.Quite. Pamela smiles a broad satisfied smile at the boys, smooths down her skirt and opens the script.Now, If you're insisting upon this musicality you feel is SO important for my film then I suggest I hear one of your ditties. No one is in the mood to sing for her.I shall keep an open mind!Well I simply don't know what to say. That's the worst song I've ever heard.A pot of tea.Thank you. Tea is a balm for the soul don't you agree? But the barman has already moved on to another patron. Time moves swiftly, the teapot is drained, the customers come and go. The barman talks with another customer further along the bar. Nobody notices Pamela. In this setting she looks like a little old lady, awkwardly perched on a stool, staring into her empty cup.I meant heartless. I'm afraid a jumper wouldn't suffice. It's bringing up these-- it's so hot and stuffy I feel like I am being attacked. These odd dreams, like my subconscious is after me. Punishing me for entertaining the idea that I might hand her over. I am at war with myself Mr Russell.Serves me right. Money, money, money. Bit me on the bot. Her eyes stray to the big Mickey Mouse. She drags it onto the bed with her and climbs back under the covers, clinging onto the stuffed toy for comfort.I'm sure your country doesn't have any laws about sharing a pavement. As they walk the sound of the piano filters out of the rehearsal room window and down onto the lot.Is it?It seems enormously patronising to me. The very sort of annoying tune you would have playing in your themed park I daresay. All giddy and carefree, encouraging children to face the world unarmed. All they need is a spoon and some sugar and a brain full of fluff and they're equipped with life's tools. Wonderful! Dick is completely deflated.MRS Travers! My point is that, unlike yourself, Mary Poppins is the very enemy of sentiment and whimsy. She is truthful, she doesn't sugar coat the darkness in the world that these children will eventually come to know. She prepares them for it, she deals in honesty. One must clean one's room; it won't magically do it itself! She waves the script in the air.This whole script is flim flam! Where is its reality? Where is its heart, where is the gravitas? She opens a window and flings the script out.No weight Mister Disney! See? Dick, Don and Bob look out of the window as the pages flutter downwards and spread themselves over the Disney lot.You think Mary Poppins is saving the children Mr Disney? Pamela sighs, shakes her head.Oh dear.Why did you have to make him so cruel? The boys jubilance is halted immediately.He was not a monster!You all have children yes?And do those children write you letters, make drawings for you?And would you tear up those gifts? In front of them?! Silence. They know where this is going.It's a dreadful thing to do! I don't understand! Why must father tear up the advertisement his children have written and throw it in the fireplace!? Why won't he mend their kite? Why have you made him so unspeakably awful?I can't bear it.Please don't-- I'll feel like I let him down again-- She leaves the room, head hung.It's blasphemy to drink tea from a paper cup. Ralph, shifts nervously from foot to foot. He's not quite sure what to say to her or why he brought the tea. Pamela puts the tea down and continues to fiddle with bits and pieces of twig and bloom that she's plucking from the area around her.All the way to England? Yes, please. Ralph lowers himself onto his haunches.You're an impertinent man you know? You ask an awful lot of questions that have no relevance to you being able to carry out your duties.And you have no barometer. Ralph is confused.Let us say that I haven't family who'd notice whether I was halfway across the world or sitting in my living room. She pulls a thread from the hem of her skirt, ties two twigs together.Make a little furrow, there. Ralph dutifully does as he's told, looking over his shoulder for fear of being caught digging holes in Disney soil. Ralph pokes the ground, thinking.Well, most people do.Now look. She takes the lid, twigs now sticking out of the poked holes and places it in the centre of what we now see is one of Pamela's tiny parks, she gently rest a leaf on the twig struts forming a roof.It's a band stand. She takes the cup of tea and gently pours the steaming liquid into Ralph's trench, which runs all the way around the park.Wouldn't that be nice?Are you a doctor?Check ups are for medical practitioners no?What can I do for you Mister Disney?Walt-- er.They went as well as they've gone every other day that I've been here. I don't recall `special' phone calls from you on any of those other evenings.Ha!I cannot tell you how uninterested, no, positively sickened I am at the thought of going to see your dollar printing machine Mr-- Walter. She notices Mickey's innocent eyes staring at her and gently turns his face away.Disappointments are to the soul what the thunderstorm is to the air. Walt slams the phone down. Pamela stares at it in shock!Hello? Hello? He hung up! I'm! I! I can't believe he hung up! Walt leans back in his chair and grins, Tommie enters.Where are we--? This isn't the way.(realizing where she'sI'm sure I don't know what you're--Little park? I haven't a clue what you're talking about.Concentrate on the road. Always chitter chattering!Is it all like this? Pamela pops a headache pill.Do you always get everything you want Walter?With the exception to the rights to my books of course!Tidbit.Gosh.Who?She flew in through the window one day.No thank you. I'm happy to watch.Maybe in you Mister Disney, but certainly not I.I said what?You brought me all the way out here to tell me that?What horrors have you in store for my beautiful characters today, hm? Bob clenches a fist but Dick gives him a look that says: keep calm.Well.Yes! He fixes the kite! Oh, I love it! Dick punches the air.Though proper English would be `Let us go and fly a kite.' Bob glares at her.But I might be willing to overlook that.Father?Do you know you're quite right? It is beautiful. Exquisite.As you wish. Pamela is genuinely curious.Now, how in the world does Mister Disney propose to train penguins to dance?!I've heard about his implausibly leaved trees so I assume he does have some insane penguin wrangling scheme but it does seem rather far fetched. Can you train penguins?Sorry?Where is Mister Disney?I would not like to take a seat thank you. I would like to-- She heads for Disney's office and Dolly is up and running after her down the corridor.I shall not sit in the seat of a trickster! A fraudster! A sneak!Penguins! Walt is confused.Penguins have very much upset me Mister Disney! Animated, dancing penguins! Now, you have seduced me with the music Mr Disney, yes you have. Those Sherman boys have quite turned my head but I shall not be moved on the matter of cartoons. Not one inch sir!You promised me. You promised me that this film would not be an animation!So they're real penguins?Good day Mister Disney. She turns on her heel and leaves. Disney stares at the pages aghast.Please call my driver and have him pick me up.You shouldn't make promises you can't keep, especially to children, they hold on to them you see? And those promises they just sit there inside of them, like little doses of poison, all those broken promises, eating away forever.The books weren't written for the children. They were written for the promise breakers.Yes. Thank you.I simply can't give her up. Not yet. Perhaps not ever. I don't knowI can't, he's--I just-- Goodbye Mr Disney. She goes to get in the car and Disney puts a hand to stop her but Ralph blocks it.No one likes a fibber.You found out?Would you like me to sign it?I'd be honoured. Ralph hands her his pen and she begins to write.Your daughters name?Really?To Jane and her dearest father-- I've just this instant realized I don't know your name.Pamela.You're the only American I have ever liked, Ralph. Ralph is chuffed to bits.No. Now take this-- She hands him the piece of Beverly Hills Hotel stationery with her notes on.They all had difficulties. Jane can do anything that anyone else can do, do you understand? Ralph looks at her in awe.Look at the bottom.Deficiencies in concentration and hyperactive behavior. Explains everything! Pamela turns to leave.Hello house.Oh dear god! Standing on the doorstep is Walt Disney. Pamela is, quite literally, speechless.But, you always get what you want eventually. Isn't that right Walter? He looks down at her hand clenched into a fist and shaking.Milk. The milk goes in first. He attends to it.And whiskey. I'll have whiskey in mine. Disney follows her gesture to the whiskey decanter. She takes it from him and pours a generous slug into her teacup.You've come to change my mind. To beat me into submission.How do I misjudge you?And don't you?Mary Poppins isn't real.Well, Where is she when I need her? Hm? I open the door to Mary Poppins and who should be standing there but Walt Disney! He laughs.Ah! Not true then that Disney created man in his own image?Can't say I do and as I have no plans to ever set foot on American soil again I'm afraid I never will.I don't know what you think you know about me Walter--I don't need to forgive my father. He was a wonderful man.Enough.I should say so too. The doorbell sounds, voices. Pamela begins to tap again.For goodness sake! She rises from her chair, smoothes down her skirt and makes her way to the front door.Please don't screech like an alleycat!I should think you'll have a draft very soon.She's quite the worst maid I've ever had!I don't know-- she reminds me of me. Diarmuid laughs.Mary Poppins in the Kitchen.NEVER again.Oh, I'm not going.Hollywood premieres are not for old trout like me. Anyway, it's notI'm perfectly capable thank you. The flight attendant recognizes her with something akin to horror.Me again!I'm here for my premiere.I didn't receive my invitation, but I just assumed the American postal service had fallen down on the job as per usual. She smiles sweetly.That's very kind, Mr Disney. I knew you wouldn't have forgotten me.How indeed? You did, after all, assure me that I wouldn't be disappointed.Ralph! She rushes to him and they give each other a friendly hug.No, no. It's just that-- I can't, I can't abide cartoons! We stay on her face as we bring up the final song of the film: Let's Go Fly A Kite. The audience around her are smiling, laughing, singing along. Pamela, the tears, silent now, still pouring down her cheeks as she slowly begins to mouth along with the lyrics. And in her head one final image appears. Travers gaze falls upon Ginty, outside his bedroom window, sweeping. Their eyes meet for a brief moment, an unspoken understanding of what is to come, before his close with tiredness.", "clean_line": "cherry blossomsmrs travers shan going diarmuid buries face hands ve

It's such an honour to-- He suddenly sees that Pamela is more deeply entrenched in herself than usual and his priority becomes her.You ready to go Mrs?The lady's ready to go now sir. Walt steps away and Ralph closes the door to the car.It's been a pleasure driving you Mrs.I was telling my daughter all about my day and how I was driving this nice writer lady, Mrs Travers for Mr Disney and--Jane.Uh huh. Like the girl in the book.Ralph. She shakes his hand.Pamela.May I ask why?Walt Disney!Thank you Mrs. Pamela doesn't look back.Had a feeling a certain friend of mine might be needing me tonight.You look like a million bucks! Let's get you to the ball. He opens the back door for her and she climbs in.This is your night. None of this would be possible without you. She brings her arm down, straightens her dress and breaks into a smile, making her way down the carpet to frantic whispers amongst the press and autograph hunters of: \"Who is that?\" \"Is that anyone?\" Pamela spots Walt, Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews being interviewed together up ahead. Mickey Mouse bounces down the carpet and slows-- he and Pamela lock eyes for a brief moment. He holds out his gloved hand, she takes it and together they watch as a huge toy train chugs to a halt on the blvd and hundreds upon hundreds of coloured balloons fly out of it's roof and into the air.", "clean_line": "travers travers welcome mrs travers welcome city angels pamela sneers grabs bags let sun came hello jasmine okay mrs travers problemo got brand new air conditioning missus cool right time feel like good old engerland things cars days shakes head inno problemo good morning mrs hm yes ma certainly gestures madame pamela grimaces oh sad okey dokey sun yes ma ralph starts engine drives away beautiful ain ya alright mrs pamela hear mrs pamela looks eyes red rimmed crying uh brought tea hands tea takeaway cup okay ma like drive home got family mrs gotta kid jane got kinds troubles pamela raises eyebrow handicapped know myelitis transverse river lake change venue morning apparently thinking tea party oh isn nice holy mackerel wowzers met right real living breathing oh boy new woah mister disney hi huge fan honour suddenly sees pamela deeply entrenched usual priority ready mrs lady ready sir walt steps away ralph closes door car pleasure driving mrs telling daughter day driving nice writer lady mrs travers mr disney jane uh huh like girl book ralph shakes hand pamela ask walt disney thank mrs pamela look feeling certain friend needing tonight look like million bucks let ball opens door climbs night possible brings arm straightens dress breaks smile making way carpet frantic whispers press autograph hunters pamela spots walt dick van dyke julie andrews interviewed ahead mickey mouse bounces carpet slows pamela lock eyes brief moment holds gloved hand takes watch huge toy train chugs halt blvd hundreds hundreds coloured balloons fly roof air"}, "WALT": {"raw_line": "Don't worry! There's nothing wrong with your television set. This is a pixie bell, the sound is much too high for human ears. Tinkerbell flies into shot.Oh there you are Tink! She covers Walt in fairy dust.Well, there ya are at last! Pamela gets up, smooths down her skirt, and makes her way serenely towards the man, who rushes down the corridor to greet her.Oh my dear gal! Pamela is open mouthed.You can't imagine how excited I am to finally meet you! Pamela doesn't know what to do with this amount of enthusiasm. She extends a formal hand before he manages to get her in an embrace.Walt, you gotta call me Walt, ya know. `Mister Disney' was my old man. There's a hint of something mournful in the way he says `old man.'Come here! Come here! He links his arm through hers, much to her chagrin, and leads her into his interior office past an imposing floor to ceiling cabinet bursting with Academy Awards.Tommie, say hi to the one and only P L Travers!Have a seat, sit down. He gestures to a comfy couch in the corner but Pamela takes a seat in front of Walt's desk instead, glancing at the sign above it: We Can Make Them Live. Walt perches on the edge of the desk, close to her, gazing at her.Ya know, I can't believe it. P.L. Travers, right here, in my office, after all these years-- almost twenty of `em. Twenty. Long. Years. Pamela narrows her eyes.Wish ya coulda' seen me then Pam! As lean as a whippet I was! A race horse! Interestingly, she doesn't pull him up on using her first name and shortening it too!But now, here you are. Look at you! I could eat you up!When Diane here was seven years old I-- can I get you a drink? Coffee? Soda?My imagination was caught on fire! And I mean ON FIRE! And those embers have burned ever since-- as you know.I got old asking. He sits back down on his desk.About my getting old?Yeah I suppose it is. They're both women now. Gosh! Can you believe it?Now Pam, a man can't break a promise to his kids. No matter how long it takes to keep. No matter how long! You might've kept me dangling all this time but now we gotcha!Pam, Pam, the last thing I want is to make you feel--You see, I promised them. That's a fact. You got kids?That's what being a daddy is all about right?This movie isn't just going to make my kids happy. It's going to make ALL kids happy! You see my guys are gonna do things with it that are, well, are revolutionary. He's up again.REVOLUTIONARY,Pam!Mary Poppins will literally fly off the pages of your books! The door opens and Tommie comes in with the tea, Walt gestures for her to bring it to him.Now imagine! This magical woman who has only lived in your head, you'll be able to meet her, speak to her, hear her sing. Tommie places the tray on Walt's desk and leaves the room. Walt picks up the tea pot.No?Oh yes she does!In your books!Tell ya what. You just listen to what my Sherman boys have come up with and if they don't knock your socks off then I'm the King of England. Pamela rolls her eyes.Bet you would. She smirks, as does he.Greensleeves huh?Greensleeves.Pam, I want you to know that the last thing I would do, the very last thing, is tarnish a story I have cherished. He moves closer to her, takes her hand, she needs it for her teacup, it's awkward.The pages are worn down to tissue, dog eared and falling out. I have poured over them gripped, tormented. Because I love Mary Poppins, you got to share her with me. Pamela is torn between finding Disney captivating and totally barking.A course nothing happens without your say so. Absolutely Nothing.It's all in the rights agreement. As approved by your agent, Dermot.Darmitt. Disney hands the rights agreement and a pen to her, Pamela takes it without looking and folds it up.Live action.Hm?Tape you say. She pops the rights document in her bag. Walt's joviality, his bright demeanour, vanishes in a split second.I understand. I do.Let's make something wonderful. She leaves his hand hanging in mid air.Okay that'll work.I asked for that.Because I asked for it.Tommie! Tommie appears in his office with a glass and hands it to Walt.What do you think?You're a woman.What am I missing?May I walk with you?Forget ironic, it's iconic. Pamela rolls her eyes.I won't be able to stop singing that for weeks!What's your point Pam?No whimsy or sentiment says the woman who sends a flying nanny with a talking umbrella to save the children.That'll work. Dick nods, still playing. Walt makes his way to the piano, sighs, sits next to Dick on the stool.She's going to say no isn't she?Inspired by someone we know?She won't.I do. I know it, I know it only too well.He was this big terrifying New York producer and I was just a kid from Missouri with a sketch of Mickey but-- it woulda' killed me to give him up. Walt peers down at the sleeping Bob.Honest to god killed me. That mouse, he's family.Pam!Callin' to check up on you.Hm?Pam, are you always so battle ready? P.L. Travers in her breast plate and chain mail, sword up in the air and off with your head!Please, I beg of you, please please call me Walt.I heard things didn't go so well today.What's this all about Pam? Really? Silence.I'm wondering what I have to do to make you happy.Aren't you wondering that too? Silence.You know, you've never been to Disneyland! It's the happiest place on Earth! (shouting away from theOh come on! When does anybody get to go to Disneyland with Walt Disney himself?!I'm not a violent man Tommie but if Mrs P.L. Travers were to get hit by a large truck I-- (he doesn't allow himselfOkay boys. We gotta fix this.Welcome to the Magic Kingdom! Pamela steps out of the car and her eyes nearly pop out of her head with brightness of the place, unbelievable colour and excitement.Yup! Isn't it wonderful? Ralph hovers at the car, filling his eyeballs with as much Walt Disney as he can get before he has to drive away.Pretty much!War ain't over yet Pam! Walt takes Pamela by the arm and leads her through the gates and a murmur goes through the crowds as they gawp. A YOUNG WOMAN breaks free and rushes up to Walt.In Adventureland there is a tree-- this is a fun fact. A titbit.And they said only God could make a tree! Pamela rolls her eyes. There is a protracted silence as they walk, both encompassed by their own thoughts. The sunshine, the joyful crowds just background colour. They pass by a store front and Walt glances up at the window. It reads: Elias Disney Contractor Est. 1895. Pamela notices the look but doesn't say anything.Where did she come from?I think you know who.Through the window huh? Pamela nods curtly.It's just that easy isn't it Mrs Travers? He sees right through her.I know you don't wanna be here so I'm gonna take you to one ride-- my favourite amusement and then I'll set you free. Way ahead of them the carousel spins in the distance.Mrs Travers, I would be honoured if you would ride Jingles. She's Mrs Disney's favourite horse. He escorts Pamela to a beautiful white horse, roses on it's bridal.No greater joy than that seen through the eyes of a child. Pamela looks at the children climbing onto the carousel.There's a child in us all.Get on the horse Pamela! Pamela sighs and allows Walt to help her onto the horse.When we first met, you said to me `they're family.'Mary Poppins, the Banks's, they're family.No. I brought you all the way out here for monetary gain. Had a wager with the boys that I couldn't get you on a ride. I win! He clambers onto his own horse, gestures to the ride controller and off they go! Pamela gently bobs up and down, Walt waves to her and she sees the unbridled thrill from the child in Mister Disney spilling out. The tiniest, tiniest of smiles threatens to surface on her lips as he points a finger in the air as if shooting for the stars.Yah!Don't worry Tommie, please close the door. Disney gestures to his cigarette.Never let anybody see me smoking. I'd hate to encourage bad habits. Please, sit down.Mrs Travers, what in the world has upset you so?It's a sequence--And it isn't!No they're animated.Pam! Pamela! Mrs Travers! Wait!Please Mrs Travers-- You must listen.Pamela? I don't understand why this is so hard for you. Please, make meThe promise breakers? Mrs Travers I-Mrs Travers? Ralph pulls up and gets out of the car.Hi.You must reconsider. You must.He's? Walt watches the car disappear, wracked with frustration and confusion. He takes a seat on Pamela's bench and wraps his arms around himself and looks to the sky.She's gone? Tommie looks down at her paperwork and nods at Walt apologetically.(expecting to read herThen who's Travers? Tommie and Dolly look at each other and shrug.I've been talking to the wrong person.It was one heck of a job getting a seat on the very next flight, let me tell you.How about you show me how to make one of those nice English pots of tea?I remember.No, I've come because you misjudge me.You look at me and you see some kind of Hollywood King Midas.You think I've built an empire and that I want to use your Mary Poppins as just another brick in my kingdom. You think I see her with a carpetbag full of greenbacks.If that was all it was would I have pursued an cranky, stubborn dame like you for twenty years? I'd've have saved myself an ulcer!Oh, no, that's not true. She's real as can be to my daughter's and to thousands of other children-- adults too. She's been there as a nighttime comfort to a heck of a lot of people.Mrs Travers, I am so sorry. I hoped this would be a magical experience for you, for all of us. But I let you down-- and in doing so, I've broken a twenty year old promise to my girls.But it is true that you created yourself in someone else's yes? She doesn't answer. Walt takes mouthful of laced tea and coughs a little.Ever been to Kansas City, Mrs Travers? Do you know Missouri at all?It's mighty cold there in the winters. Bitter. Walt stops talking, catches himself, looks away and then gives in. His enthusiasm completely disappears and he's suddenly as ragged and as weary as Pamela.My dad, Elias Disney, he owned a newspaper delivery route there. Thousand papers. Twice daily. Morning and evening edition. Elias, he was a tough businessman. A save- a-penny anywhere you can type of fella so he wouldn't employ any delivery boys, he just used me and my big brother Roy. I was eight then-- eight years old.You'd push through it like wading through molasses.And the cold and the wet would be seeping through the shoes and the skin would be raw and peeling from our faces-- and sometimes I'd find myself sunk down in the snow, waking up, cuz I must've passed out for a moment-- I dunno. Then school, too cold to figure out an equation. And back into the snow so by the time we got home it'd be just getting dark, and every part of you would sting like crazy as it slowly came back to life in the warmth. My mother would feed us dinner and then it'd be time to go out again for the evening edition.Now, I don't tell you all this to make you sad Mrs Travers, I don't. I love my life - it's a miracle. And I loved my daddy, boy I loved him. But, there isn't a day goes by where I don't think of that little boy in the snow and old Elias with his fist and strap and I'm just so tired-- I'm tired of remembering it that way. Aren't you tired Mrs Travers? We all have our tales but don't you want to find a way to finish the story? Let it all go and have a life that isn't dictated by a past?You must've loved and admired him a lot to take his name--Mrs. Travers. It's all about him isn't it? All of this. Everything. Pamela looks at her hands, they're shaking.Forgiveness. It's what I learned from your books.No, you need to forgive Helen Goff. Life is a harsh sentence to lay down for yourself. Pamela looks down at the table top.Give her to me, Mrs Travers. Trust me with your precious Mary Poppins. I won't disappoint you. I swear that every time a person goes into a movie house - from Leicester to St Louis, they will see George Banks being saved. They will love him and his kids, they will weep for his cares, and wring their hands when he loses his job. And when he flies that kite, oh! They will rejoice, they will sing. In every movie house, all over the world, in the eyes and the hearts of my kids, and other kids and their mothers and fathers for generations to come, George Banks will be honoured. George Banks will be redeemed. George Banks and all he stands for will be saved. Maybe not in life, but in imagination. Because that's what we storytellers do. We restore order with imagination. We instill hope again and again and again. Trust me, Mrs Travers. Let me prove it to you. I give you my word.Is that everyone?There'll be cameras, press, interviews-- I have to protect the picture.Morning Dolly. Dolly opens her mouth to speak but he's already past andWhat? Tommie nods toward his office. Pamela is sitting in a chair, back to them.Mrs Travers! How wonderful to see you.

Good morning!I do apologize, Mrs Travers.Gradi. Wonderful! I welcome it.Uh. Okay, so this is the rest of your team, Dick and Bob Sherman! Music and lyrics.Who else?Uh-- erm. Ha! We had planned a little tour of the studio for you--Wanted to show the place off.Mrs Trav-- it's a long way to-- Don hurries behind her, Bob looks like he is about to murder the woman and Dick is finding the whole thing incredibly amusing.A word of advice Mrs Travers, if I may.Wow. Uhm. It's just that he can't stand being called Mr Disney. We are all on a first name basis here.We have a whole script to get through. It's gonna be a long day Mrs T. She shoots him dead with a killer stare.--ravers.Exterior. It means the scene is taking place outside.No, No, Mrs Travers please go ahead.Yes.Thank you.--extemporized and thought up before your very eyes! Alright, here we go-- Dick begins to play and sing, he pounds the keys with gusto, smiling away, acting it out with all his heart and soul, almost unable to contain himself with glee. Bob occasionally joins in for a word or two but is much more serious, eyeing Travers for her every reaction.We do find it helps to have a visual. It's fun! She stops in front of a sketch of the Banks house.It's all wrong?Um-- yeah?It does seem strange that Mrs Banks allows her children to spend all of their time with the nanny when she has no job to speak of--No! Of course not! We just felt that if she had a job it would go some way to explaining--Sybil?I could go with Winifred.Ahm, yeah, that's him--In the books he--Bob, Bob, Bob-- Pamela stares at Bob.What?!Yeah, do nanny. Dick begins to play--Yeah, I think--Time and tide wait for--Man is in the forest. Pamela and Walt enter the room.It's ironic.Mrs Travers? Again, she doesn't hear.Mrs Travers? Pamela looks at Don.We were just saying that we'd like to play you the song in the bank.So you have tuppence? May I be permitted to see it? (changing voice to MichaelVery well, my boy, give me theWhile stand the banks of England. England stands!When fall the banks of England, England falls! Travers somehow loses his footing before reaching the steps and topples off the stage. There's an audible, horrible snap as he lands in an undignified pile. But, despite his ugly injury, Travers cannot stop laughing.I love it!Who are we talking about? I'm confused.Yes.Of course.Mrs Travers! He stops, recognizing she doesn't need to be followed.Good morning Mrs Travers! She looks at the new arrangement of the room.Now, Mrs Travers you sit here. He ushers her to a chair facing the centre of the room. He hands pages to Bob and pages to Dolly. Don and Dolly drop to their knees so that they are half the height of Bob. Pamela raises an eyebrow.We thought about what you said Mrs Travers and Mr Banks isn't cruel. He isn't. We've got a new ending for the film. Oh god, I hope you like it. Bob pulls a kite out from behind his back.And then Mrs Banks goes to fetch her suffragettes ribbon.Dick.Dick.
