{"Hellboy-2-The-Golden-Army": {"ABE": {"raw_line": "Oh, Lord- He's smiling in this one.No, he doesn't. He's just- enthusiastic. As they approach HB's room...Oh, you know. The usual. Since they moved in together- Good days and bad. On cue, the concrete wall explodes!'.! A massive BALL OF FIRE swings the final steel door open, almost tearing it off its hinges.Then again, there are the really bad days- Manning and Abe cower behind a pillar. Once the explosion dies away- Hellboy's revealed, lying on the floor, his back smoking and in flames.Red- I'm afraid I do detect some activity- As the agent and Liz inspect the other iron cages, he extends his webbed fingers.More- Many more-No. Maybe a hundred- or two-They're all around us- Sounds of MOVEMENT from burrowing, unseen creatures-Uh- If I'm right, we should leave now and ask for backup.Ah, I knew it.Have you noticed the floor??Red- there is no rug- Hellboy lifts his foot, realizing he's been walking on an inch-thick layer of- ahem- poo.Precisely...Alright, but-Okay, then- They're- um- tooth fairies.Third century, the Teutoburg forest. Famished. They feed on calcium-Oh, my-Look- there's Manning... He raises the volume as Manning is shown, surrounded by microphones.Touche. More high-pitched jabbering... Johann replaces the little fairy in the holding pen.How can we find the Troll market??? Its location has been a source of speculation for centuriesWe've looked there before-- Staked it out for weeks-\"336\" The schufftein glasses??Yes, very commanding, very soothing.I like him.Oh- No, no, no, it's not a parlor trick.Oh, goodness, no- I-Very well, if you insist. You... keep... a large, battery-operated vibrating egg by your bedside... A shrieking CAMERA CREW runs up loaded with video equipment.In 1778 Emil Schufften, a Good friend of Benjamin Franklin, designed these optical sets with the intent of photographing fairies in England...Bowling balls- they give me trouble.A locking mechanism-Brother Red!!I'm following a lead, Red. Keep your locator -. A large TROLL cuts him off-Excuse me- What do you think you're doing?I don't think you- The TROLL opens a small wooden box and extracts a nasty looking Insect: A NARCOTIC BUG.Oh, my- The second TROLL loads the buzzing bug - like a bullet - into a blowpipe. Abe turns just as he blows. The bug lands on Abe's chest and sinks its stinger deep into his flesh. He groans.I - I carry no weapons, madam- I assure you...Your brother-??A revolt? No, no, no, I- You are sorely mistaken... He takes a step forward but the YRDRIG comes out of nowhere, barking and growling.My name is Abe Sapien -Horrible- I know- but- Please, hear me, I beg you. I am an agent of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. If we can assist you-Your highness, the honor is all mine.Please, it was nothing. Love the puppy,We would be... honored, I'm sure. But, may I ask: from whom do you seek asylum? Suddenly, a COMMOTION outside. The door flies off its hinges. Hellboy and Johann burst in, leaping over a pile fallen guards outside.Red, no! I'm all right! The Princess shrinks back, but Abe motions for calm.Gentlemen! Some respect, please! The Princess looks with dismay at her vanquished bodyguards. The NARCOTIC BUGS buzz around HB, who swats them like mosquitoes.Red, apologize at once! We are in the presence of... royalty! Hellboy's never heard Abe sound like this- giddy as a schoolboy.Oh, most definitely. She's from an ancient, noble line -So, you do need our help..?Just a global chart, Edo - that's the old name for Tokyo - Moscow, and Renvyle here-Pick them up!!Do as I say! With a sigh, Hellboy scoops up a few.How many do you have?Three! There's always seven! Find the last one!!!Quick, it's going for water! Hellboy reaches for it... but it's too late. The thing hops into the manhole and lands somewhere below with a SPLASH.Oh, my God, evacuate the area!This may not be the best place for you, your majesty. With your permission... He offers the Princess his arm. She takes it and allows Abe to lead her away. A moment later, the Elemental smashes the ground where they had been standing! Every time the ELEMENTAL moves, he trails behind roots and branches. The roots connecting to its feet and leading to the original tree trunk, like an umbilical cord. Johann sees this-HB? This is Blue. The Princess is fine.You'll figure it out.Johann - they're almost here. Johann moves among massive construction machinery. He stops at a stack of heavy SPOOLS OF CABLE. Abe comes running, pointing at the cable.Yes. I had the very same idea... He gets behind the levers and handles of a complex machine which holds a half mile of steel cable..but how do you operate this??I need more!I love this part. Keep going.Charlotte Bronte died shortly before I was born. It would have been a great privilege to have known her...How can you know? We all saw-Renvyle, Ireland- The ancient isles-Men... usually mean well, I believe that. But they need our help and patience.It's as you were saying, I suppose. From intuition, feeling. I've never met anyone like you... but that's my instinct. They gaze fondly at each other through the glass, as bubbles swirl out of Abe's gills.Ah, hello Red. You're up late.Barry M- oh, Gosh- no- no- It was er- urm- Vivaldi. Il cimento dell'armonia I believe I particularly admire the passage... Hellboy hits the eject button on Abe's CD player. The music stops and he pulls out a different CD from the changer.Ooh- Ooh-I know-I'd cry, but I don't have the glands for it..I miss him- Father- don't you??He would tell what to do- He would tell what's right- what's wrong-You know? I- I never much appreciated Manilow's artistry that much- until now- Now it seems to be a grand poet and speaks directly to my innermost feelings.I find these leather outfits veryWait, Red, the lab's in it-This is a most unfortunate vehicle. The sheer waste of precious fossil fuels...Carribbean Blue, actually. CAMERA MOVES to the next makeup chair, where the very sexy Makeup Girl 3 gingerly touches Hellboy's chest.Actually, Mr. Leno, my lungs are more like gills. I need to convert the air's nitrogen into oxygen, otherwise I'd suffocate in five minutes.Princess! Without thinking, he darts forward. Instantly, one of the trolls swipes at him, its claws just missing his chest-H.B., no! Stop - you mustn't harm him! As the Prince totters, Hellboy turns to look at Abe, momentarily distracted- Then-Liz, I'm sorry. It's a magical alloy. Every time I touch it, it moves closer to his heart.I cannot reverse the magic- we have to look for the Prince or somebody that can help Red.No. Sorry.No -?The map contained within the cylinder seems useless-Renvyle it is- Both the Princess and her brother were born there. They hold it sacred.We'll make it alright. Screw Manning- You are right, Liz- We should just do this together: the three of us. Liz smiles.Engine, starting- refer to NA-7488-BD... Liz climbs in behind him.Just a few more minutes. Here's an easy way to remember that \"port\" means \"left.\" They each have four- A NOISE from the door: it's Johann.Its useless- I- I- can't- I can't pilot this thing... Johann sits down in the co-pilot seat and melds with the controls...This should be the portal. By all rights- Johann reaches the tree and inspects it carefully.Renvyle is over there. They glance up and down the beach, looking for a boat. Hellboy blinks and sniffs the air. A GOBLIN speaks up from an outcropping of rocks in the shallows directly in front of them. By his side, sitting atop of a tree: A SATYR and a CROW observe the group.You mustn't. One touch can kill him. The Goblin's eyes grow wide with understanding.The only way in- I'm afraid we'll have to jump in- Can you make it-? Hellboy nods.I know- Why isn't there more security?? With a ROAR, WINK!!!!! - jumps out and throws a CHAIN around Bellboy's neck! The chain is connected to his IRON MACE which now dangles around Hellboy's neck. The two creatures battle each other fiercely. WINK's MACE destroys a nearby tree, like a wrecking ball and it connects twice with Hellboy's head. But Red gets the upper hand quickly, snapping the chain in two and twirling the mace like a boleador.Red, are you-?Stop - I have it. Abe, dripping wet, stands there, the last gold segment in the palm of his hand.You cannot fight him- not without hurting her...That was your price!! A ransom, you said - paid in good faith!!He - he's a cad! Can you imagine, a highborn heir to the throne, last in a noble line of-No= please- no- Hellboy moves away from him.Do it, please. I - I'm ready for the real world now. Johann turns the cylinder. The tree roots form their arch... and the BPRD team walks through.Yes, Mr. Manning. I want to thank you, too. For all you've done for us over the years. He gives his stuff to the astonished agent.I quit. Hellboy glances at Abe, then hauls out the Samaritan and shrugs off his pack, too.", "clean_line": "oh lord smiling enthusiastic approach hb room oh know usual moved good days bad cue concrete wall

into the room.Look- I have one rule! One- \"Don't touch my stuff -\" Liz appears, shimmering in a halo of blue flame. HB's pulls a few LP albums out of the garbage bin.You can't listen to Al Green on a CD!! You just can't!! Oh, and 8 track was the way to go- one day mankind will realize its mistake.Is that what this is about?? Your toothbrush's right there, behind you- There- there- with the cat food!! Wrinkling her nose in disgust, Liz plucks a toothbrush from a heap of spilled cat kibble.Oh, heavenly bells are ringing!Piece of cake. In and out... no one will see me. You have my word- A sarcastic guffaw from Liz.Same story here, babe-I said \"Abe\"- I'm sorry- wrong channel- Hellboy falls back to talk privately on the intercom.Liz- UM-?There's more than one-? He hears a scratching noise.How many- ten-?What are they???What are they-? Abe?Uh- thick rug, deep pile, light brown-Aw, crap-Spit it out, brother blue. What are they?No, don't- The thing SNARLS, leaps and sinks its tiny teeth into MARBLE's finger. Then it dives under MARBLE's shirt and goes to work. MARBLE gasps and drops his gun. Dozens of creatures emerge from the crack on the wall and crawl into Marble's clothing. Gasping, he tears open his shirt as claws and teeth dig in.. ribs crack... blood spurts. The agent falls.Liz!! Where are you - ?! He sees a horde of little beasts gnawing at the metal bars of a cage... .Liz cowering inside. Hellboy just has time to look deep into her eyes. A quick moment of silent communion.Do it, Liz, do it!!! And Liz obeys. Closing her eyes she-No- I'll deal with them- NOW. He dumps his backpack and pulls out a belt full of VULCAN 66 grenades. Holds it high.Vulcan 66, boys! Come and get 'em- Liz and Abe take cover on the stairs. They see Hellboy luring the tooth fairies toward the windows overlooking the street.Gee whiz, Manning-I think I did good. And I looked good, don't you think, Liz? Abe stands behind them, juggling a dozen remote controls.A gas pocket??!! Ha-! I love it. The door opens. Manning is there, holding a plastic box overflowing with mail.Against?Ungodly freaks-? Us?New - ? What?What's the matter, Manning?? Don't you trust me anymore?What about me? What's wrong with my face???But, who-? Who is this guy?Akkk- Kraus??? He's German-That's an open face for you...Memory gets pretty sketchy after you die- -but maybe I can be of help- Nudges Abe and starts fishing for an amulet.What are you doing?Whaddayawant??? You chewed off the tip of my tail- Yes, you-Jeez- your buddy there doesn't look too good.Wow- You have that effect on me too. The Fairy's cheekbones hollow and it finally collapses. Ectoplasm escapes its body and regroups at Johan's fingertips.If you're really German- how come you don't have a funny accent?What a moron!! \"We are on the move\" He thinks he's so hot!! We've been looking for that place for years and we've never found it- You said so- Abe pulls out TWO headsets of COMPOSITE GOGGLES, made of copper and glass, full of buzzing and whirring pieces. He tries it on.For good?!I think he's a jerk.Well, then you're a jerk, too. \"The brains of the operation-\" give me a break!Ha! Me? Threatened?? Glaring, at Liz:By whom? By him??I did that?Hey- We got some hate mail.Something else bothering you-? Liz nods quietly.So- Tell me about it-It's the garbage truck. It makes the wrong statement. About who we are.It's \"Hellboy\" not \"Demon-man\"- One of the projectiles hits him. The crowd roars. Hellboy gazes back at them- seething.Great P.R... He gets ready to pummel the crowd. Liz stops him.This is sooo corny- A moment of silence ensues-- Then, the wet-eyed reporters applaud- the crowd applauds- Liz applauds, Abe applauds. Hellboy is agog!!What-?? What-??Nothing yet, Sparky, over-We're moving in, Sparky-How about a beer, then? Now that we're \"out\"- Whaddya say, Mein Herr?What the heck is that?Mmh- I'll take care of it- He clenches his stone fist, rears back...Ah, of course- the Fishbowl touch-Hiya, Chuck-Well, neither am I- BAMMMM!!!!! With a single uppercut, he sends it flying toward the ceiling, shoeless. The shop keeper watches in awe until it lands, about thirty feet away in the middle of the dogfight. The crowd scatters as the mongrel creatures attack the thing with blind instinct. Hellboy grabs the shop owner by the lapels and pulls him close. The shop owner's head rockets back and forth like a boxer's speed bag as HB \"gently\" slaps him around. Teeth fly everywhere.Feeling more chatty now??Where the hell is Abe?? He pushes his belt locator-Abe? What's wrong?Human side, two nights ago- The Princess studies their faces.What-? What-? A goblin army-? Johann shakes his glass head, overcome with worry.Where is that crown??Good, I like trouble.I'm gonna put this as delicately as I can.It's a dud, your royal assness - ! The Prince has disappeared, along with his horde.How do you like that? Just when I was loosening up. Then... CLACKK!!!. Hellboy scrutinizes the grenade as it opens up like a beans. flower... and spews out a handful of Brightly coloredAbe. relax- It's jumping beans... Abe is scrambling to retrieve them.Three, how about you?Abe, please, get a grip. A RUMBLE from below their feet. WHAMMMM! A HUGE TREE punches up through the pavement, overturning cars, knocking buildings off their foundations and ripping up through the Bridge overpass!! Picking up speed, the tree branches soar up, up, up... into the moonlit clouds. Hellboy approaches the massive, trunk, gazing up in fascination. Birds and creatures emerge from the inside and flutter around, grass overtakes pavement- and for a moment Chinatown looks like the Garden of Eden.Whoa. Just like the story books. Manning and Liz take a few steps into it: a SQUIRREL-BEING climbs on Liz's shoulder and a couple of IRIDESCENT HUMMINGBIRDS fly around her \"ala\" SNOW WHITE. A small crowd starts wandering into this idyllic scenario.Hey!!! He spots. the prince, at the base of the tree. Knocking on it-Hey- Jhonny Apleseed- What are you-?? Oh- Jeez did you have to do that?? Liz starts pulling Manning away and yelling at the crowd-Good dog. Now, Woody... You want to fight someone, you fight with me. Hellboy humorously adopts a kung fu pose, as in Bruce Lee. The Elemental hops forward, New branches sprout from his limbs, shaking the Yrdrig off.What now, Big Boy? You get a ladder? The Elemental jumps up and down, trying to reach him, barking in frustration. Hellboy's RADIO crackles:So what?That's nine blocks from here, Fishbowl!What's at the bridge? Abe - ? Liz? Hello??? No answer. Muttering, Hellboy climbs higher, up a buzzing neon sign reading \"Hotel\". The Elemental smashes the letters \"tel\"... so Hellboy climbs the \"0\" to the roof.I've been all through this! The answer's still no! Far below, Johann slips his right arm into the cable, bringing it to life, whipping it back and forth, like a steel snake! The cable forms a huge loop, splashing down near the Elemental and tightening around his ankles. The cableNap time, Big guy- He raises his stone fist and hits him straight in the back of the neck. The cable tenses- -The Elemental pitches forward- The Prince looks up to see the Elemental falling right at him; his mouth opens as if to scream... The Elemental goes down, impaling himself on a spire atop the bridge... exactly where the Prince had been standing. Putting an end, it seems, to both of them.Oh, I wish for something. Johann brings his target close: a beautiful, tight cluster of shots, dead center.Hey, watch it! You're winding me up, I don't like it.You keep wiping that thing like she's gonna care.You know who- She-Why not?Well- From now on, you don't come near her. You don't talk to her-Well- you better start making them \"evitable\"-Yes, it is-Now it is-I try.\"Give me???\"- You don't give me sh-Slo-??Slow enough for ya-?? With a loud HISSS, Johann's odd suit sags to the floor!Ow- Johann... buddy. Sorry- I- I- got carried away... Johann? You still hear me? An ectoplasmic TENDRIL reaches out from the suit and penetrates the closest locker.It was an accident, okay? I'll get you some help-Chicken shit!He caught me off-guard- but I'll get him next time. He's examining a few letters, contract forms, etc.We are- he's not- The guy's an egomaniac. You can see right through him.Look!! They wanna do a cartoon series, based on me? And this: Product endorsement - breakfast of demons. And a videogame!!! As CITY LIGHTS ends, Liz lifts the remote to turn the volume up.No, wait. Look that's us- Jay is showing some footage from the giant incident.That's a great idea, don't you think??Did you know that during the commercial breaks the orchestra keeps playing so the guest can't talk to Jay... keeps the conversation fresh.I read it in TV Guide.We should do this-That's funny.Liz and I- we had a fight-Did I hear Barry Manilow just now?What's happening to you??You say that like it's a good thing. What track?\"Can't smile without you\"He did that for all of us... The opening strings of \"Can't Smile Without You.\"Jeez- You need to get out more- The two of them sit there, growing quiet, listening to the syrupy music. Then, slowly, the two of them start singing: low at first and then at the top of their voices, moved and teary-eyed.Correctamundo, chief. For one thing, we can ditch the garbage truck, right?Screw the lab. I want new wheels.This is more like it!There you go, pal. \"To Jason, best wishes, Hellboy.\"That turns up on e-Bay, I'm gonna find you, \"Jason\"...Well, yeah. Each one tells a story- His grin fades as he sees Johann talking to Liz. He abruptly gets up and goes to them.That about you, glass-man? A few squirts of Windex?Thanks a bunch. I'll decide that.It's a love story. They'll lap it up.Hey, we do call her Sparky now and then. A chuckle from the crowd. Hellboy smiles in satisfaction.Uh... I-Abe! No, get back!! Abe regains his balance and tries again, his eyes glued to the desperate features of the beautiful young woman. Hellboy manages to restrain him.No. Why don't you just start with me? Hellboy strolls up to the Prince.You bet your ass I do-Five-fingered Mary. In the background, Manning arrives, wide-eyed. Just in time to see the Prince hand off his captive to one of the trolls. He drops back, flips his spear to horizontal and waits for Hellboy's attack.Not my style. Watch and learn, fish bowl. He punches the Prince, hard. The blow knocks the Prince to his knees; as he rises, Hellboy connects with a brutal combination. In the arms of the troll, the Princess' head rockets back and forth, as if struck. A moan of pain escapes from her lips.Don't worry, Sparky- It's all going to beWhere are we, Liz..?I thought you were mad at me.I'm sorry for all the attention, I thought it would be good for us.You still seem sad. Is there anything you want to tell me-??Say it now, then. Whatever it is, I'm ready.And call you in the morning, right?? Like Hell I will. I'm keeping an eye on you,See?? It hurts!!! It hurts!!! Hellboy grips the chain, pulls the creature close, then, like a weightlifter, raises him high overhead. With a mighty GRUNT, Hellboy tosses him overboard. WINK hits the jagged rocks once- twice- thrice-Ouch- ouch- ouch- We better go swimming before any more ugly fellas show up- He stares down into the swirling waters and discreetly takes his hand to his bandaged side: He's bleeding. The wound has re-opened.Don't say a word, Blue- Let's move on-Says who? I'm fine, I tell ya. He lurches forward, pushing past the others, fighting off his pain.Hey, amigo. You got some gum? Two rows away, Johann examines the lethal weaponry that terminates the arms of each soldier.Wow. You hear that? Listen - He thumps it, harder. The mechanical thing rocks backwards...Uh oh. CRASH!!! The thing falls onto the soldier behind it! Then,Whoops. The sound dwindles, then builds again as ANOTHER LINE of falling soldiers bears down on them!! Liz screams and Hellboy pulls her aside. The soldiers crash past them until - - the din suddenly stops. The PRINCE stands revealed at the head of the column.Yeah. Now it's your turn.Abe -Abe old buddy. If we survive this, we need to talk. The Army swings into action, marching toward them. The four friends retreat, soon pressed against one of the walls.Prince Nuada: I challenge your right to command this army! With a soft BOOM, the clockwork troops come to a halt! All the mechanical heads turn toward the Prince, who stands on a ledge with his sister.A challenge must be answered! Raise your sword!I- have- won-You - and your kind! Leave here. And stay in the shadows - where you belong. As the ogres slink back into the tunnels, Liz looks at Hellboy. He seems angry, stung by the Prince's last words.Looks that way, doesn't it? Hellboy starts to leave, but spins around and takes his gun back.I think I'll keep this. He finally meets Liz's gaze. She crosses to him and takes him by the arm. She walks off with Hellboy and Abe, clinging tightly to the big, red daemon.I mean it! `Course, I'm thinking USA... but, hey - you decide.Milk? Yech.Grow? who gonna grow- ?Our b-? On Hellboy's immense grin: FREEZE FRAME. Roll CREDITS.

I need some space! Not much, but just enough to find- to find- my- toothbrush. She flares up, losing control...Damn it, Red- there's no room for me here. You can't just act like- Suddenly, the alarm SOUNDS. Hellboy is elated.No one here. No survivors. No bodies.Don't call me babe-Yes?That's not the problem and you know it.No. That's not the problem either-Not now, for God's sake!What kind of creature?Damn it Abe, just tell us!Abe, c'mon- cut the crap. She checks her boots, sticky with poo-It is mine- -the gentle flame blooms into a cloud of fire. Liz goes supernova. BAMMM!!!Red, Red, this way- Hellboy kicks the critters away, shooting again and again.HB?? HB?? Are you alright??No one asked me anything. Manning pulls a fistful of mail out and tosses it on a table.Polls- protests- hate mail- Liz grabs a few letters and scans them.The troll market- ?Get used to it. He might be here for good-He has a nice voice.I think you feel threatened... Hellboy stays behind- thinking- thinking real hard.Not just him- this whole thing you did. The TV- the reporters-Yes, Red- absolutely. 'Cause you did it without thinking- You just wanted to be in the public's eye- well- you're there- but so are we.I will, but not now- I'm sorry if- I-Shh! Give him a chance...I read you, Red. Keep looking- Manning is bored, looks at his watch.Red, turn on the \"antiglamour\" filter... Fairy folk use a spell called \"glamour\" to seem human and nice-She eats them.This is so beautiful-Back- Go back- right now!!!He's knocking on wood- summoning anA forest spirit that lives in that tree. He's releasing it-There shouldn't be a \"next time\" we're all part of the same team.Gosh, that was so sweet, so sad- It always gets me- Red- There's something I need to-No, I don't-How do you know these things?You're really liking this, aren't you?It's a bad idea. All of it- Do you really need everybody to like you?? What's in it for you?? Are we not enough??? She leaves. Hellboy glances at Leno on TV: a dog outfitted in a ballerina costume is jumping around with a red ball balanced on its nose. Hellboy chuckles.Maybe.I think I may have made a mistake.Just a mistake- nothing important.No. Not yet. CAMERA discovers HELLBOY, watching them from behind a glass door, a six-pack in his hand. He steps away.I'm not driving that- Abe has opened the hood on his Hummer.I was born in Milwaukee, so it was just plain old Liz ever since first grade.You know, Jay, we are- together. We are. Rumble of consternation from the audience.As a matter of fact, Jay- Before she can finish, the production assistant runs out and hands a NOTE to Leno, who scans it and grows serious:Abe, stop studying! Pull the friggin' thing out, why don't you?No! I don't want to see it! We've got to do something!Go after that son-of-a-bitch and get him to reverse the spell!!So? We find it! We give it to him-!! Manning exchanges a worried look with a couple of his agents in the b.g.Any luck? Liz has come in behind him. Abe quickly palms the precious thing in his webbed hand.It doesn't matter.No. Forget the gold piece. Let's us just find this royal asshole.Abe, let's do this for Red! Abe nods, unable to find a good answer. He manages to tuck the gold piece into his belt.What about Red?? Don't you care about him??? A moment of silence. Nobody knows what to say. Finally:I see. Red was right about you. Welcome to the team, Johann. And goodbye. She leaves the room.We stay here much longer, we're gonna get caught...Don't try to stop us, Johann.Near the ocean, Red.We'regonna make you well here.Yes! Try it, Abe-You're wasting time! Abe inserts and twists the cylinder. The tree comes to life, hauling its roots out of the ground, bending them into a swaying arch.Yes! Can you help us?How much?Here... is a wonderful set of eyes, magic eyes that will bring the world-Don't you touch it - ! She rushes to Hellboy's side, pushing the Goblin back, ready for a fight. The Goblin shrugs.Oh, my God. She knows - ?!Yes, I say yes-! Abe and Johann exchange a silent, worried look.And I'll deal with it when that time comes. Now save him. The creature cackles and then grips the spear tip with the tongs. A cry of pain from Hellboy as it withdraws the bloody point from his chest.I almost lost you- Hellboy smiles and grabs her hand-Well, no one can stay mad forever.We're never going to make them all happy, Red. What we have is ours and no oneYes you are. You are the best man I've ever met.Yes, there is-No- no- what are you talking about?? Before she can go on, Johann appears. He carries a poultice and fresh rags.Hold up. We need to rest.This was a mistake. He's -Make that machines, Johann. I see more than one. Hellboy taps on a soldier's mechanical chest, which booms faintly, sending ECHOES up into the dark cavern.Let me - Liz summons up a white-hot burst of electrical fire in each hand. With a yell, she unleashes a searing EXPLOSION at the oncoming fighters. The shock wave rolls through the enemy ranks, flattening scores of soldiers. For a moment, the BPRD team regains hope... but the endless lines of mechanicals keep coming, marching on and over their scorched comrades. Hellboy holsters the Samaritan and rushes forward, giving it his best. His wound is running with fresh blood. He punches a soldier, whose mace pounds repeatedly against his ravaged chest; as blood spatters his face, Hellboy groans and keeps fighting, to absolutely no effect. At length, the mechanical arms throw Hellboy against the wall, where he collapses, unable to carry on.No!! NO! ! A sudden movement at the ledge, where the Princess steps forward and... Using her concealed DAGGER, she STABS HERSELF in the right arm!! In silent slow motion, she drops the dagger. Instantly, the Prince drops his arm... his hands come away red with blood. He looks over at his sister. They share a hard look of mutual understanding. Love and hatred. Hellboy raises, through supreme effort, bleeding. He quickly raises his sword. The fight resumes, but this time, HB has the advantage. He fights bravely and after parrying fiercely with the Prince, he disarms him and points his sword at his chest.What you said before - about us livingLet's find a place in the country.

His unearthly voice is velvety and warm. Almost soothing. Liz smiles. Hellboy glowers as Kraus' fishbowl head turns toward them.Poor things, bought and sold on the black market. Smuggled in tight, cramped cages. Let's see what they can remember-Oh, no, no- No amulets are required. He adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and approaches the lock.I can inhabit inanimate things: organic,Exactly. A PROTOPLASMIC emanation seeps out from his fingertips, slightly deflating his body. The tendrils enter the- -\"Dead\" Fairy.I can briefly take control of entities, both mechanical and organic and reactivate their neural system- The \"dead\" Fairy snarls and bares its teeth at Hellboy. Two more do the same from another pen.You scare him- The fairy blabbers furiously while glaring at HB.Rough translation: He says you are rude, brutish and not too bright-Enough. it seems our little friend here remembers a noise. A very peculiar noise in the last place where his cage was traded: market sounds-Exactly, Miss Sherman. The Fairy starts babbling uncontrollably and grows pale and weak.I'm losing my grip on its limbic system- He feels nauseous. I'm afraid he's about to die-Yes, well- Trolls dwell under bridges- And Vladimir Vanya 18th century occultist- places it under Washington BridgeYes, but this time I have asked for a very special piece of equipment- He moves in to a large crate marked \"Lot 336\"On loan from the Smithsonian. Plus we have this clue- He produces the sketch of the ROYAL SEAL.In my mind we have enough to go by- Any questions?? Abe is about to ask something when, abruptly, Hellboy raises his hand-Yes- what is it?They head towards the garbage truck. Manning, Abe and are waiting there.Let me take care of this. Johann bravely confronts the news teams and the crowd.Ladies and Gentlemen, my name is Johann Kraus and I beg you to allow us- -Please, we need space to work- please-In due time- very soon- we will provide all the answers you require, all the whos, whys and wherefors- But for now- An egg hits him in the face- hard. The crowd roars--it's been a long... long time... for many decades really, that the BPRD has served you- all of you... in silence. We have waged an unknown war - but a very real one. Heroes have died unrewarded and unrecognized so that you might go about your daily life. To work, to marry, to bid your children goodnight. Little by little, the crowd grows quiet.In exchange, we have been consigned to the lies and racist innuendo of the tabloids. And there we have lived without complaint - until now.But perhaps soon- after learning of our hardships and sacrifices, you may decide that our humble lives may, in some way, have a value... and a meaning-I pray that you will allow us to defend your good fortune- to guarantee the blessing that is a peaceful night's sleep. A night free from monsters and nightmares. And if so- If so- then all we ask in return... from you... is a little respect and the chance, remote as it may be, to prove ourselves worthy of a tiny, tiny place in this- God's Earth.Come on. We have work to do-Sorry. I don't drink.No- You destroy it. We'll never get in- He adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and approaches the lock.Johann's s ecto-tendrils enter the-Gentlemen: welcome to Troll Market.What about this?? Do you recognize this seal?Please. We'll make it worth your while. The shop owner claps his hands. BERSERKER takes two steps forward, ROARING. Its iron shoes go CLOMP-CLOMP!!You're vouching for her, I take it. Mr Sapien?- of warriors. The Children of the Earth. I'm sorry, Princess Nuala. With such a fierce bloodline, we cannot take your claim of allegiance at face value. He produces the ANCIENT SEAL.I feared as much.Golden Army. The unstoppable tide. There has been nothing to substantiate such aThere. Stairs to the street...I have a plan- He looks at Abe-So, lead him to the bridge. Hellboy looks over the buildings and sees the Brooklyn Bridge in the distance.If you'll permit me... Johann opens his fingers, and plunges both arms deep into the mechanism! Instantly, the diesel engine STARTS UP.Stand back, Abe. A hydraulic strut lifts the spool, then pitches it through the air, spinning off 300 yards of cable. It splashes down near the far shore of the East River.Now, tie it onto the pontoons on the other side. Quickly, Abe!Macht schnell! Abe - make it fast! The cable is a yard short of the anchor point! Abe tugs onNo more available! The Elemental's feet stomp through the river; he stumbles as he encounters the submerged cable.Burn the roots!!! Burn them!!i He points at the roots trailing into the river. Liz concentrates and a bolt of fierce white-hot energy pours out of her hands, burning the roots at the Elemental's feet. Johann gyrates; the cable responds, whipping up out of the river! With a bellow, the Elemental loses his balance; he tosses Hellboy high into the air. On the way down, Hellboy grabs a support stay and swings back and forth like a red monkey. He lands atop of the Elemental's back, right behind his head.You'll permit a small criticism? You take too much time to aim, to think. Nein. Just point- like afinger- as if you wish for something.Speed is of the essence. You must work on it. I'm willing to spend some - Johann reaches for his loader, accidentally knocks Heliboy's onto the floor.On the contrary.She- Who-??You think I'm after Liz, don't you? Well, I'm not.You forget. I'm part of the team now, such interactions are inev-That's not a word-No, it isn't- Hellboy raises his stone fist.Oh, I see- you want to punch me- That's how you win an argument.Well, you're big, I'll give you that much--and you're strong- but you're slow.Very- slow- I've seen your fighting style. Very slow- WHAM-! Hellboy cracks Johann over the head with his massive fist. To his surprise, the Johann's glass ball cranium shatters!See? Speed is the key. The vaporous form of Johann's body emerges from the lockers and wanders away. The locker room doors open and close as he goes by. Hellboy tries to stand, wobbles and sits.Are you alright-? Liz nods weakly.May I be of assistance??He's a big brute, isn't he?? Liz chuckles.But he has a good heart. I know it. He means well.In what way, Mein Frau??It never is. I know. Lis looks at him with renewed interest.I was married once. A long, long time ago... And only after I lost her- I realized that my life would never be quite the same- And my loss lead me to become what I am today... Johann's human face materializes inside his glass helmet.I- I tried constantly to make contact with her-It was only there- in the Ethereal plane that I ever gazed upon her again... CAMERA close in on several ceremonial candles burning in the room. Their flame illuminating the eerie scene.I owe Professor Broom everything that I've become. He brought me back to life- He grows silent for a brief moment.But I've never been able to see her again. My reach became limited- My loss, infinite... Liz puts her hand on his shoulder. Johann takes it...Loss- the very threat of it makes us vulnerable... makes us care- You can see that, don't you?? Without her I became but an empty shell... Liz leans her head on his shoulder.Don't give up on him. Not yet. Liz chuckles.I'm not going on. And if I may- a word ofYou don't know how people may react.I know you don't like me, but trust me on this one.Do as you may- But know this- he wouldn't have approved of your behaviour. A P.A. opens the door.I'll be watching from the truck lab, where I belong- Go, enjoy your fifteen minutes... He walks away.Uh oh. Manning, I think your polls just tanked. He turns to see the map- lit like a christmas tree.Mein Gott-Arm yourself! Use the flail!.He'll demand the gold piece-The Rebellion's spreading too fast- The only way to stop it is to stop the Prince.Liz. That may be his destiny. Manning is right: we can't take the chance. Liz glares at him.Good evening, friends.On the contrary. I've been giving it some thought, and we should be able to save Hellboy. After all, the Prince lacks the gold crown. Without it, his army poses no threat. None at all. Abe is very quiet.I'll give it a try- Abe smiles at the sound of the engines starting up.Abe, bring the mapcase over here. He's found a roundish SLOT in the tree, where the lowest branch joins the trunk. Abe slips the map back into its crystal cylinder and holds it alongside: it looks to be a perfect fit.Before you do anything... remember what we're in for. A world unlike anything we've ever known. Dangerous, deceptive...Dangerous, deceptive... and hard to leave. They walk under the tree roots, into...What will it cost, boatman? The Goblin smiles, displaying a disconcerting row of triangular teeth.I have a... belt!Our ferry captain - he wants his payment...Abe and I have found the entrance to the Golden Army's resting place- Liz come with us- You should stay behind and get some rest-There. Abe points at the violent sea below-Hang on, people. I'll be right back.Mein Gott-- The stairs lead to-Most ingenious. A versatile, highly mobile killing machine.We do not -The death you would unleash will never happen! What you need is far from here and will stay out of your reach forever.Oh, my God. What has he done? Keeping his eyes on the Princess, Abe gives the gold piece to the Prince. Hellboy steps forward, feeling dizzy and betrayed.Invincibility!? So - the only one thing may stop them - Johann unzips his suit; with a HISSS, his ectoplasmic self flows out, into the body of the nearest mechanical soldier!Ach. They are too many. Anyone have another idea? Hellboy grabs the nearest sword and hauls himself to his feet.Hellboy's too weak- Summoning up his last ounce of strength, Hellboy manages to drive the Prince back into the center of the arena, where they fight under the inscrutable gaze of the golden army. Every time Hellboy gets a clean shot at the Prince, Abe looks at him, pleading, and HB has no choice but to keep parrying off his enemy. Hellboy's sword grows heavy in his hands; he stares at it in dismay as it trembles. His muscles can no longer respond. The Prince is ready to kill him.Any last minute requests?Manning, you're an asshole.", "clean_line": "johann kraus service unearthly voice velvety warm soothing liz smiles hellboy glowers kraus
