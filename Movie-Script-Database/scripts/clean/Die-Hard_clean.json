This is my first time riding in one.Married.The past six months.You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?It's okay, it's okay.She had a good job, it turned into a great career.Closer to Japan. You're fast.'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.How 'bout some Christmas music?It's corny, but I could live with it.I'll find someplace.You're all right, Argyle.Holly McClane?Cute toy.Thirtieth floor... *Lots of hardware...California...Excuse me, I'm looking for --Yeah.

I remember our first date.Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync. I think it's me. Is there a place I can wash up?Son-of-a-bitch. It works.It's a long story. You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago. He said I could bunk with him.Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.They would, huh?Especially my name. You must miss it every time you write a check. When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?Sure. It's unnerving. I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?Oh, here it comes. One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --Hi. John Gennero here. I'm the sensitive and supportive man of the eighties.Don't I always?Schmuck!Argyle...?What do you want, 'All My Children'? We're making progress. After I get my foot out of my mouth, we'll really be cooking, and then I can --Shit...Think...32 construction...33 computers...Argyle. Tell me you heard the shot.

My Captain keeps telling me the same thing.Let's go.A million terrorists in the world and I kill the one with feet smaller than my sister.Jesus...Mayday, Mayday! Anyone! Terrorists have seized and Nakatomi building and are holding 30 or more hostages! I say again --They've already killed one hostage, and they're fortifying their positions while we're bullshitting! Now, send police backup ASAP!-- fine! Report me! Hey, come down here and fucking arrest me! Send the police. NOW -- !Whew...for a moment there I was worried.All right!Where's the fucking cavalry?Come on, come on...who's in that car, Stevie Wonder?Drop it or you're a rugstain.Thanks for the advice.Oh, man, please, no --Welcome to the party, pal.Gee, I'm sorry, Hans, nobody gave me the message. You shoulda put it on the bulletin board. Anyway, I thought you and Franco and Karl and the other boys might be lonely, now that I waxed Tony and Marco and their buddy. So I invited some of the guys from my card game.BZZZ! Sorry, Hans, wrong guess. Would you like to go for Double Jeopardy, where the stakes are double and the scores really change?Bad for your health anyway.Just the fly in the ointment, Hans. The monkey in the wrench, the pain in the ass -I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers. I really dug those sequined shirts.Yipee-yi-yea...mother-fucker.I read you, Powell. You the guy in the car?Maybe later. Just listen fast because this is a party line and the neighbors are trigger happy. Now here's the skinny: There's thirty or so hostages on the 30th floor, with probably 2 or 3 guards to cover a group that size. The leader here is named Hans, and besides the pea shooter he ventilated your car with, * they got machine guns and * sidearms up the yin yang. On top of that one of 'em had a big enough chunck of plastic explosive to orbit Kate Smith. *Figuring there's at least one to cover the lobby, a couple with the hostages...I'd say they came in with about a dozen...but they're down to nine now, including the skydiver you already met. These guys are mostly Europeans, judging by their clothing labels, and they're well financed and very slick.I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune. Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.I'm ahead of you...partner.'Roy'.They're all yours, Al. Good luck.Powell? Al, you still with me? What's going on? Al?Al, what's wrong? Did something -- -- Oh, God. You're coming in! That's it, isn't it? Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --No...Hans, you motherfucker, you've made your point. Let them pull back!Geronimo...motherfuckers.Al! Al, the guys in the car, did they make it?The plastique I found. Is the building on fire?Two? Are you sure?Glass, my ass! Who the fuck is this?Well, from up here, it looks like you're in charge of shit, Dwayne. I haven't seen such a fucked up operation since the Bride of Frankenstein. Ask the guys in the armored car if they minded a little flying glass.Asshole? I'm not the one who just for butt fucked on national TV, Dwayne! Now if you're not part of the solution, stop being part of the problem! Get off the Goddamn radio and put Al back on!Pretty fucking unappreciated.Thanks...partner.Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies. Yucck. What do they put in these things?You sound like a man with a couple of kids.Two. And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.Sister Teresa in third grade called me Mr. McClane. My friends call me John Mac. You're neither...shithead.Ellis?Ellis, what have you told them?Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...Yeah, I hear you, you fucking moron!Don't you think I know that! Put Hans on! Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him! I hate his fucking guts -- -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --Go fuck yourself.Al? Al, you there?Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours? That doesn't even make any sense --The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.Lost?Whoa, whoa, easy man. I won't hurt you. Who are you? What are you looking for?Forget it. They got a guy up there. You want to stay alive, keep moving. Hey? You hear me?Only if New Jersey counts.Relax, man...you smoke?I'm a cop from New York.They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?Better than being caught with your pants down, right? John McClane.Bill, you know how to use a handgun?Sounds better than nothing.Time for the real thing.Hans. Your Hans.That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.Yeah. Like you did with Takagi.You think I'm a shmuch, Hans.Yeah. But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia. By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.Yeah? What's the odds?Put me down for twenty anyway...I'm good for it...so, what got you off the street, Al? You liked lousy coffee, or what?They way you drive, I can see why.I...I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make a joke of it.I still feel like shit.Powell? What's going on?Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me. Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me. She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry. You get all that?I hope so. But that's up to the guy upstairs. Upstairs... ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?Stand by, Powell. I gotta check something out.I was here...he was...Oh my God...Powell! Powell, listen to me! You're being double crossed! The whole roof of this building is --Better this way, isn't it? I mean, any faggot can shoot a gun.You should've heard your brother scream when I broke his fucking neck...Where's Holly --What? God --Listen to me! All of you, get down to the lower floors -- you're all in danger.-- there won't be shit for those helicopters to land on, because the whole top of this building is wired with explosives! Now get below --Safe, my ass! This ain't a helipad, it's a launching pad!GET BELOW! NOW!You assholes, I'm on your side -- !Fuck this...Shit...Hans!Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.
