Even if you get past them, you'd be dead before you covered a hundred yards. If the terminators don't get you, the fallout will-- heavy rads all the way to the Gulf coast, nothing can live there.Lt. Blair Williams, I fly for what used to be the Air National Guard.That snap you out of it?So let me get this straight, Marcus. There you are on death row, they stick a needle in your arm...Whatever they pumped into your veins just knocked you out. This Angel Project you signed up for-- there was a lotta cryogenic stuff going on before the bombs fell, they musta froze your ass.Drug tests, medical experiments, organ harvesting, who knows? You said you had no family, no friends-- why let a body like yours go to waste?We're in a mutation zone.

Marcus, I'm so sorry...How's it going, Barnes? Thought you might like a late-night snack.We got a stash back at the base.You need something to wash it down.You know I always liked you, Barnes. I just didn't want to join the harem.Noble of you to make the sacrifice.I prefer a little privacy.Men. You're all talk.I don't believe you're a terminator.Whatever you are-- I owe you one. Once you're free, I'll lie down next to Barnes-- they'll assume you escaped while we were passed out--Worth a shot. Marcus, Command wants to take you apart, cut open your head.

My ELT-- emergency locator transmitter. If you find the camp, activate it like this. It could really help the Resistance.Sir.Sir-- he isn't a terminator. He's human.He's trying to find his friends.A couple of kids. They were taken in a Skynet transport, probably to some kind of prison camp-- he said their names were Star and Kyle.Mm... Kyle something. With an `R.'That's it. How did you...?Marcus...
