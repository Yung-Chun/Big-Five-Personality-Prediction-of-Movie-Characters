A man your age To be as strong as you are! A memory stirs... You make me think of a man From years ago A man who broke his parole.. He disappeared.Forgive me, sir. I would not dare -Monsieur le Mayor.Tell me quickly what's the story. Who saw what and why and where? Let him give a full description, Let him answer to Javert! In this nest of whores and vipers Let one speak who saw it all. Who laid hands on this good man here? What's the substance of this brawl?She will answer for her actions When you make a full report.

I've done you wrong, Let no forgiveness be shown. I've been as hard On every rogue I have known. I'll bear the blame, I must be treated Just the same.I mistook you for a convict, I have made a false report. Now I learn they've caught the culprit - He's about to face the court.And of course the thief denies it, You'd expect that from a con. But he couldn't run for ever, No, not even Jean Valjean.He will pay, and so must I. Press charges against me, sir!Must I do as you say?Valjean, at last We see each other plain! `M'sieur le Mayor' You'll wear a different chain!You must think me mad! I've hunted you across the years.

Another stink in the air! Was there a witness to this? Well, let him speak to Javert!Monsieur, these streets are not safe. But let these vermin beware, We'll see that justice is done!Look upon this fine collection Crawled from underneath a stone. This swarm of worms and maggots Could have picked you to the bone! I know this man over here, I know his name and his trade. And on your witness, m'sieur, I'll see him suitably paid.But where's the gentlemen gone? And why on earth did he run?Could it be he's that old jailbird That the tide now washes in? Heard my name and started running... All the omens point to him.And the girl who stood beside him, When I turned they both had gone. Could he be the man I've hunted? Could it be he's Jean Valjean?Let the old man keep on running I will run him off his feet!

Better be warned They have armies to spare And our danger is real - We will need all our cunning To bring them to heel.I have overheard their plans. There will be no attack tonight.

Yes, Valjean, you want a deal! Shoot me now for all I care - If you let me go, beware! You'll still answer to Javert!I warned you I would not give in! I won't be swayed!The man of mercy comes again And talks of justice!One more step and you die.Take him, Valjean, Before I change my mind! I will be waiting... 24601!Who is this man? What sort of devil is he? To have caught me in a trap And choose to let me go free? It was his hour at last To put a seal on my fate Wipe out the past And wash me clean off the slate! All it would take Was a flick of his knife Vengeance was his And he gave me back my life!Damned if I live in the debt of a thief!

The cries in the dark that nobody hears Here where I stand at the turning of the years.I am reaching, but I fall And the night is closing in... As I stare into the void - To the whirlpool of my sin.I'll escape now from that world - From the world of Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean is nothing now!Another story must begin!What is this fighting all about? Will someone tear these two apart? This is a factory, not a circus.Now come on, ladies, settle down. I run a business of repute.Deal with this, Foreman.

I will her to the hospital.Where is she?I will see it done! I will send for her immediately!I don't understand. What is this crime, Javert?You say this man denies it all, And gives no sign of understanding or repentance? You say this man is going to trial, And that he's sure to be returned to serve his sentence?You have only done your duty It's a minor sin at most. All of us have been mistaken You'll return, sir, to your post.It's your duty to obey!They think that man is me - Without a second glance. This stranger they have found - This man could be my chance!I am the master of hundreds of workers - They all look to me. Can I abandon them? How would they live If I am not free?Can I conceal myself for ever more? Pretend I'm not the man I was before?

You know nothing of the world - You would sooner see me dead. But not before I see this justice done!I am warning you, Javert, I'm a stronger man by far! There is power in me yet! My race is not yet run!And this I swear to you tonight -Your child will live within my care -And I will raise her to the light.Hush now, do not be afraid of me. Don't cry.

Suddenly the world Seems a different place Somehow full of graceWho are you?Monsieur Fauchelevent!Now you can do the same for me. We need a place of sanctuary. This child and I, we need to disappear.We'll give thanks for what is granted What the sisters may ordain Here we pray for new beginnings - Here our lives can start again.What is this? Are you mad? No, Monsieur, you don't know what you say!Dear Cosette, You're such a lonely child. How pensive, how sad you seem to me. Believe me, were it within my power I'd fill each passing hour. How quiet it must be, I can see, With only me for company.No more words - No more words. It's a time that is dead. There are words That are better unheard, Better unsaid.You will learn. Truth is given by God To us all in our time, In our turn.Cosette! Cosette!My God, Cosette! I heard a cry in the dark. I heard the shout of angry voices in the street.This is a warning to us all! These are the shadows of the past!Must be Javert. He's found my cover at last. I've got to get Cosette away Before he returns.We must get away from shadows That will never let us be. Tonight we leave Cosette!Rue de L'Homme Armee.And then a ship across the sea.Hurry, Cosette! Prepare to leave, And say no more. Tonight we'll away!Hurry, Cosette! It's time to close another door And live another day!One day more! Another day, another destiny. This never-ending road to Calvary. These men who seem to know my crime Will surely come a second time - One day more!One day more!One day more!One day more!Tomorrow we'll be far away.I'll take it.`Dearest Cosette, you have entered my soul And soon you will be gone. Can it be only a day since we met And the world was reborn? If I should fall in the battle to come Let this be my goodbye. Now that I know you love me as well It is harder to die. I pray that God will bring me home To be with you. Pray for your Marius.

There's something you can do.Give me the spy Javert! Let me take care of him.We meet again...You talk too much. Your life is safe in my hands.Get out of here.Clear out of here!You are wrong, and always have been wrong. I'm a man no worse than any man. You are free, and there are no conditions - No bargains or petitions. There's nothing that I blame you for. You've done your duty, nothing more. No doubt our paths will cross again.Go!God on high Hear my prayerLet me go! He's no more than a boy. I am old. I have nothing to fear.How do I get out of here?It's you, Javert! I knew you wouldn't wait too long. The faithful servant at his post once more. This man's done no wrong. And he needs his family's care.Another hour yet And then I'm yours And all our debts are paid.Come, time is running short - Look down, Javert! He's standing in his grave!Then I die.She was never mine to keep She is youthful, she is free...Not another word, my son. There's something now that must be done...There lived a man whose name was Jean Valjean. He stole some bread to save his sister's son For nineteen winters served his time In sweat he washed away his crime.Years ago, He broke parole and lived a life apart... How could he tell Cosette and break her heart? It's for Cosette this must be faced: If he is caught, she is disgraced... The time has come to journey on, And from this day he must be gone! Who am I? Who am I?Make her believe I have gone on a journey A long way away. Tell her my heart was too full for farewells - It is better this way. Promise me, Monsieur, Cosette will never know......What I have spoken, why I must go.Alone I wait in the shadows I count the hours till I can sleep. I dreamed a dream Cosette stood by It made her weep To know I die... Alone at the end of the day Upon this wedding night I pray Take these children, my Lord, to thy embrace And show them grace... God on high Hear my prayer Take me now To thy care Where you are Let me be Take me now Take me there Bring me home Bring me home!I am ready, Fantine...At the end of my days...She's the best of my life...Cosette?Cosette, my child! Am I forgiven now? Thank God, thank God, I've lived to see this day!Now you are here Again beside me Now I can die in peace For now my life is blessed...Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to die! I'll obey I will try...On this page I write my last confession. Read it well When I at last am sleeping.

You need some help!But you will live, Eponine - Dear God above! If I could close your wounds with words of love -You will live a hundred years If I could show you how... I won't desert you now...Hush-a-bye, dear Eponine You won't feel any pain A little fall of rain Can hardly hurt you now I'm here.I will stay with you Till you are sleeping.Her name was Eponine! Her life was cold and dark, yet she was unafraid!Gavroche! Do you know the Rue de l'Homme Arm\u00e9?Will you take this for me?Thank you, M'sieur.Do I care if I should die Now she goes across the sea? Life without Cosette Means nothing at all.. Please don't weep, Cosette, Should Marius fall. Will you weep, Cosette, For me?I will go into the streets. There are bodies all around. Ammunition to be had. Lots of bullets to be found.Grandfather...There's a grief that can't be spoken There's a pain goes on and on Empty chairs at empty tables Now my friends are dead and gone.Here they talked of revolution Here it was they lit the flame Here they sang about tomorrowOh my friends, my friends, forgive me That I live and you are gone There's a grief that can't be spoken There's a pain goes on and on...Every day I wonder every day Who it was brought me here From the barricade.Cosette, Cosette!Waiting for you! At your feet!M'sieur, this is a day I never can forget. Is gratitude enough For giving me Cosette? Your home shall be with us And not a day shall pass But we will prove our love To you, whom we shall call A father to us both, A father to us all.You're Jean Valjean!Monsieur, you cannot leave! Whatever I tell my beloved Cosette She will never believe me.I give my word.For the sake of Cosette, it must be so.All he asked for me to say He's on a journey, far away. Dear Cosette, he loves you so Perhaps he will return some day.No, `Baron du Thenard', The circles I move in are humbler by far... Go away, Thenardier! Do you think I don't know who you are?In God's name say what you have to say.I know this! This was mine! This is surely some heavenly sign!Then it's true! Then I'm right! Jean Valjean was my saviour that night!Not so loud! Here's for you. God forgive us the things that we do.Where is he?It's you who must forgive a thoughtless fool! It's you who must forgive a thankless man! It's thanks to you that I am living, And again I lay down my life at your feet. Cosette, your father is a saint! When they wounded me He took me from the barricade, Carried like a babe, And brought me home to you!", "clean_line": "man general lamarque speaks people anger land long judgement day tell knowvive le general lamarque won franc ve earned bridges burned like way tease eponine girl eponine eponine discover lives careful let father know eponine lost ghost ghost maybe like ghost minute gone seen today know feels struck bone moment breathless delight feel soul world colour desire colour despair life burst like music angels light sun life stop scarcely begun eponine friend brought thanks gods heaven near soar world new free waiting near heart love heart song wrong oh god shame know dear mad moiselle won tell marius pontmercy cosette know lost heart light away cosette cosette dream heart love single look knew today gone mean live today live parted follow goes shall join brothers stay dare place fight hey little boy god eponine things trouble starts ponine shot clear ll blow barricade eponine eponine hurt need help live eponine dear god close wounds words love live years won desert hush bye dear eponine won feel pain little fall rain hardly hurt stay till sleeping eponine life cold dark unafraid gavroche know rue homme arm\u00e9 thank sieur care die goes sea life cosette means weep cosette marius fall weep cosette streets bodies ammunition lots bullets grandfather grief spoken pain goes chairs tables friends dead gone talked revolution lit flame sang tomorrowoh friends friends forgive live gone grief spoken pain goes day wonder day brought barricade cosette cosette waiting feet sieur day forget gratitude giving cosette home shall day shall pass prove love shall father father jean valjean monsieur leave tell beloved cosette believe word sake cosette asked journey far away dear cosette loves return day baron du thenard circles humbler far away thenardier think know god know surely heavenly sign true right jean valjean saviour night loud god forgive things forgive thoughtless fool forgive thankless man thanks living lay life feet cosette father saint wounded took barricade carried like babe brought home"}}}
