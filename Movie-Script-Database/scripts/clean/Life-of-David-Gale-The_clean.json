{"Life-of-David-Gale-The": {"DAVID": {"raw_line": "I'm going home. Let's do the press fax tomorrow.Hey!Yo! Officer!Your seatbelt.Hello.My lawyer respectfully suggests you adjust the speaker-system volume.They're practicing being cruel and unusual.I need it for Billy's appeal.Sorry. Have a seat.Yeah, known Benny most my life. Met the summer after 4th grade, spent the day burning ants with his dad's magnifying glass. We called it playing 'Execution.'Since I grew up in foster homes, he's become the only family I have.We agreed minimal contact would be easier. Please don't mention her, or my son.How should we start?Think. What do you fantasize about? World peace? Thought so. Money-Fame-Ferrari? A Pulitzer? Nobel? M.T.V. Music Award? A genius hunk -- ostensibly bad but secretly simmering with noble passions, and willing to sleep on the wet spot?A Victoria's Secret model -- just slumming between law school and running her family's Vastly Endowed Foundation for Tragically Sad-Eyed Children?Okay, good, you see Lucan's point. Fantasies must be unrealistic. The minute you get something, you don't, you can't, want it anymore. To exist, desire needs absent objects. So desire supports itself with crazy fantasies...This is what Pascal means when he says the only time we're truly happy is when day-dreaming about future happiness.Or why we say, 'The hunt is sweeter than the kill' or 'Be careful what you wish for.'Not because you'll get it, but because you're doomed not to want it if you do. Think about it next time you're at a wedding.There usually is, Berlin.Anything, huh?Anything?Tell you what, I'll give you good grade, a really good grade, if you will... ...study.Hey.'Yes, Virginia, the people of this State have overwhelmingly affirmed the reality of Santa.'Tell me again why you aren't doing the debate.I hadn't noticed.That's not what I meant.'Governor, you bat a lovely lash for a woman who executed thirty eight last year.'Anything else?I'm going to Greer's party. Fax them to Sharon's number at the house.Apropos playing Mother.Did you mark your calendar?Only three. That's great, huh?What's he doing in here?Where's your laser gun?That's 'cause you're a special-duper- super-quadruper boy. Who's now going to sleep.Who loves you?Ooooh. Good night, son.Good night, Cloud Dog.Back before midnight.Rest assured.Meinen Herren.Spain.Looks like Sharon's affair is an open secret.Yep.He mentioned it.It's called schmuck.The part of the foreskin that gets thrown away. I think it's called schmuck.Black Bush.For what it's worth, I didn't know about the suspension.More like a conciliation.There once was a lesbian from Canjuom, Who took a young man to her room, And they argued all night, As to who had the right, To do what, how, and to whom.Enough. That's enough.I'm done.Don't think I want to know what that means.Cute.Berlin, this, this is not...What?Sorry. Yeah.And 'Almost Martyrs' don't count.Um-hum.What?I can listen and appear to listen at the same time. Yeah, no. Damn, I left it home.Nothing. Everything. Something profoundly stupid happened last night.It was Berlin.Constance, you're not my wife. Thank God.I didn't mean --Are you okay?So you don't subscribe to the idea that 'a good state is one that protects its most despised members'?It's a quote from you, Governor, from your first state attorney campaign.So, basically you feel, to choose another quote, 'society must be cleansed of elements which represent its own death.'No, ma'am. That was Hitler.Governor, can't we examine the possibility that capital punishment isn't working. That murderers aren't deterred by the law because they have about as much forethought as lemmings. That it's expensive, inequably administered, that......that we may even be killing innocents.Dead men can't make a case.Thank you, Governor.Of course.Look, I wanted you to do this anyway.What's that supposed to mean?Look, guys, there's not much more to say --What, arguing with the Governor is a crime?Berlin had my bite marks, bruises, ripped clothing. My skin was beneath her nails. It didn't look like anything but rape. Two days later she called the D.A., said she wouldn't testify, too drunk to be sure, etc. On the plane home, Sharon read about her husband's rape case being dropped.Finger authority, show she was smarter than the powers that be.First year in here I received a card postmarked San Francisco. It wasn't signed, but I suspect it was from her -- the front had the text 'Sex is Power.'Yeah. It said, 'I'm sorrier than you can know.' See you tomorrow, Ms. Bloom.Off-the-record?Constance was murdered with what's called the Securitat Method. You're hand-cuffed, forced to swallow the key, taped at the mouth, a bag's sealed over your head and you're left to suffocate. The Securitat did this to Romanians who wouldn't inform or confess. Sometimes the bag was ripped off at the last second, you got a second chance. If not, you die knowing the 'key' to your freedom was inside you the whole time. A cheap-but-effective metonym. Problem is I mentioned the method in an early article. The prosecution never knew.It's more than that.There was a tripod.Not a single print was found on it. Someone brought it, wiped it, left it. Why? It's as if they wanted me to know that somewhere there's a record of what really happened that afternoon. As if they wanted me to die knowing the key to my freedom was... out there.Ms. Bloom. I'm an anti-death row activist on death row. Doesn't that strike you as odd?No.But I have someone on it, someone I'm hoping will one day find an answer.A journalist.'She's a smart one.'Who's your hero?Call me when you get to Boston?I wish you --After awhile, Crocodile.Okey-dokey, Artichokey.Okay?Well?How did Ross vote?And you?So, I wanted to get your feedback on the idea.So my chances of getting partial custody aren't good?I feel... washed.Nothing like I need you, both. You're all I have.Jo Ann will be commuted and you'll only prove the system works.Where'd you get those?Hey! She ever not make you work when you come by?What's her story?Constance, who did she kill?She admit to it?You're a crazy woman. Not your medium grade thinks-she's-Teddy Roosevelt's- bathrobe, but stark-raving-loose- screws-in-the-belfry insane.A real danger to flora and fauna.And how.You're burning up.Hello, folks.Gladly.Latte on your left, partner.Sharon, pick up. For once just pick up the goddamn phone! If you keep him in Spain, I'll... I'm begging you. He's my son! Please! Please.... Please.We're seeking refuse, refuge, uge.We fell off our wagon.Know why Saint Jude is the patron saint of lost causes? 'Cause his real name was Judas. There were two Judases, Judai, the saint guy and the bad Judas who ratted on Jesus, and tried to kiss him. Medievalers wouldn't pray to good Judas for fear of getting bad Judas on the line by mistake. Ergo, they only gave him business when really desperate. That's why. Then they changed his name.Constance?Your mail's blowing.Fine. How's Constance?What?Constance has leukemia?No, no.When I asked why she hadn't told me, she muttered, 'too busy.' I guess she figured as long as death was chasing her, she could help others escape.Constance left the world better than she found it. It's a small, difficult thing.Okay, okay. Calm down. You have to sit.Sorry. Look at me. He's not your man. His name is Dusty Wright, DeathWatch Director before Constance. He's a 'bullhorner,' a zealot who thinks a good demonstration has to end in a riot and arrests. 'Almost martyrs don't mean shit.' They fired him. Constance kept him in the organization, and he loved her for it. The man adored her.He and Benny used to work A.C.L.U. cases together, until Dusty punched a clansman in a federal court. Benny sometimes still gives him work, probably had him follow you.To make sure you honored your agreement, one for which there's no contract.He's a lawyer, Ms. Bloom.I wasn't 'seeing' Constance.It's more complicated than that.Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Where are you?Denial's my personal favorite.Mending bridges.No regrets?Me, too.How much... how many lovers have you had?Including college.Well, it's... not every... yeah, you should have had more sex.I see you.Want to make it five? Finish the hand?It wouldn't be pity.Are you okay?I'm here. Happy. I'm very happy.I'm here.It's okay.Okay.Shhh. I'm staying.It's okay. I'm inside. I'm not pulling out.I know, I know.Shhh.I'm here. It's okay.Shhh. I'm here. I'm here.Rescued. You?Let's say they move back from Spain, that I somehow got my one weekend a month. Would it matter? By high school, I'd be his weak spot, the focus of locker room jabs, embarrassed pride. In college there'd be late- night angst: 'What if I turn out like the old man?' Holidays would be forced smiles and unscheduled exits. I mean, what girl comes home with you if there's talk that Pops is a rapist?I can't stand the idea of being his model of failure. Without him, I drink. To cover the hole. To prove to myself he's better off without me.Sorry, just leaving.If I could answer... we wouldn't be having this conversation. It's why I need you, why I chose you. You have my story, now... 'Go.'You'll find time.You're not here to save me. You're here to save my son's memory of his father -- that's all I want.We live to stop death. Eating, inventing, loving, praying, fighting, killing -- choose a verb. All to stall this evil, Job's 'king of terrors.' But what do we really know about it? Nobody comes back. There's a point, when your mind out-lives its obsessions, when your habits survive your dreams, when your losses... You wonder, maybe death is a gift. All I know is that by this time tomorrow, I'll be better off. What I don't know is why. Goodbye, Bitsey.I couldn't watch.It helped her to think her death would save me.Yeah.

What's lordosis?Meaning?Protecting sources, even kiddie porn scumbags, is magazine policy.I could go if I were an ugly blabby guy?'Well, Your Honor, I started to notice that my assignments were evaluated on the basis of my sex.''Certain references were made -- 'I'm not baby-sitting.Gale was seen leaving the house.His sperm was inside her.His prints were all over the kitchen, including one on the bag.Okay, half-a-thumb print.Do you fondle your friends' garbage bags?Hey, Zack?He did it.And, empirically speaking, a psychotic.Shit! The light's on again.Thanks, Zack. Do you smell anything?A person's politics has nothing to do with their propensity to commit crime. Aren't we supposed to smell it if it's overheating?Throw the cigarette out so we can smell.No! You'll stink up the car. Throw it out!Zack!We better pull off. Shit, this is so irritating.Look.Is it hot?I don't know, something male.Company.Actually yes.Little early, isn't it?I meant the book.What time is it?Never eat where the menus have pictures of the food.First, this isn't a story. It's an interview. We come, I listen, you watch, we go home. Second, there is no 'us' in the assignment.Drive around looking for decent restaurant.My reputation got us invited here. I play by the rules. It's called objectivity.Yes, hello.Bitsey.Yes.No.No.Thank you.Yes.He said the gift shop could do it.This is Zack.Hello.So...He's a character.Where's your ex-wife?All right. Anything else, just clearly say, 'off the record.' I'll take it to my grave. But then you know that about me. Otherwise I wouldn't be here.Is this recording equipment?I'd say you're a man with a story to tell, Mr. Gale. You chose the magazine, the format. You chose me.Go.Why'd she do it?Do you know where I can find her?Anything written on it?Try phone records, a net search.Don't ask me that. I don't know. There is no truth, only perspectives.Working on our philosophy merit badge, Zack?This you know telepathically?Seven. 'Check out the crime scene in Austin.' You made it sound so close. Shit, two and half hours and that damn lig --Hi. I'm Bitsey Bloom and this is Zack Stemmons. We --Uh, yes.Okay.Oh, sure.Do many people take the tour?We know, you can save that.It was in the case file.Zack, open your vanity.The vanity mirror, pull it down.See that truck behind us?Isn't that the cowboy from the rest area?Weird coincidence, huh?Alright, we're off.You're telling me someone's framing you?Right, facing her body. Are we on?Maybe you're being paranoid?Any ideas who 'they' are?Belyeu's hired a detective?For God's sake, Zack.It's not a happy place.What else?I don't want a surprise.What a life, waiting around for someone to die.This is a little too coincidental.Forget it. What time is it?It's a long story.Give me an hour.Zack!It's open.Look!Look.What did you tell her?Thanks. How about the V.C.R.?Whoever got in here -- without a key in broad daylight -- was probably smart enough not to leave prints. I have the remote.They don't look for D.N.A. when someone breaks in to deliver, Zack. Here.No. Start it.I hope this isn't what I think it is.God, no.Turn it up.No, it's perfect. He knows News Magazine won't give the scoop to the dailies or nightly news, not after having paid for it. Probably guessed we wouldn't call the cops. And, most importantly, knows I'll tell Gale tomorrow.Zack, what if Harraway's murder was just a means to getting Gale. I mean sending him through hell, a sick cat and mouse game. You kill the one person he has left. Make sure he sits six years on death row for the murder -- a place he's made a public career of loathing. And then just let him die, die knowing everyone will remember him with disgust. You destroy his loved ones, his life's work, his memory -- and you make him watch.If the mouse dies the game's over. Maybe the cat's enjoying himself. Or...Imagine walking to the chamber knowing this exists.Yeah, but smart.Is it the truck?Is he gaining?Can you see the license?I couldn't sleep afterwards.Yeah, but it's her kitchen, in her house.But it will at least get us a postponement?Why?But someone put it in my hotel room.Thanks.Yeah.Shit.Did you see the cowboy go in?Into his office. Just saw him.Follow him. Find out who he is, where he lives -- what he --A taxi.Then why was he following us? Why was he at Belyeu and Crane?Why?He would've said something.Maybe Dusty was jealous because you were seeing Constance.She died... she had your sperm --But there has to be someone. Someone with a motive, who knew you both. Someone who visited that morning.There's not enough time.You know that's not what I meant. You should have done this earlier.You're going to let them kill you.Goodbye, David.No thanks.What time is it?Belyeu!Did you have Dusty Wright follow us?You could have said something.No.How's David?Tell him I'll take care of it, about his son, I mean.Mr. Belyeu.Were Dusty and Constance close?Zack! Wake up! Get up!Did you throw the towel on the floor?The towel on my bathroom floor. Did you put it there?Do you do that at home?Get up.Grab the T.V. I want to check something.We're taking a tour.Austin. Get the T.V.Wanna make a hundred bucks?We're going over the crime scene.And for the next hour I want you to do exactly what I say when I say to do it. If I say suck Zack's dick, all I want to hear from you is 'May I swallow.'Is your boyfriend here?Well is his video camera here?Get it.Zoom in a hair.Put the gloves on a dish rack.Turn them inside out.Move the tape roll about a foot to the left. And get rid of the handcuffs.Come check this, Zack. Could you... what's your name?Nico, lie down on the floor, facing the counter.That's fine. Just straighten her legs.What's this?Okay, look at this.I noticed this back at the hotel. See?She moves her foot. Why?It's another fifteen seconds before she comes to. If she had passed out once, without fresh air she wouldn't come back. There was no head trauma, her blood tested normal --Or...We've got to bag her.All right, I'll do it.Okay, I want you to wait three minutes before you take it off.Three full minutes. Just stand behind the tripod. Both of you.Have you started?Zack!She... she did it herself.She used the gloves to keep fingerprints off the tape and bag. Then she put them back on the dish rack, but upside down and inside out, a housewives' habit. A murderer would have just tossed them aside -- like they were the first time we were here, like you do a towel in a hotel.They threw me. I forgot you have to have the key to put them on. But she needed them. She knew she would instinctively try to rip the bag off, that at some point automatism would kick in.And she swallowed the key so she couldn't get to it. She made sure there was no way out.It's so calculated. She's handcuffed, taped at the mouth. The gloves. The damn tripod.I don't know.Thanks, Zack.What'd you say?Oh my God, Zack, that's it! That's why! To prove it happens. To have absolute proof that the system convicts innocents.No, that's how she thought. She lived for DeathWatch. If she's gonna die, why not die for it? That's why the tripod was here. To record proof, undeniable proof, the tape. That's why we got an out-take.Of course not. She needed help, someone to keep it, release it. Someone she could trust, someone dedicated to the cause...Come on....Because of the Berlin thing, Constance knew the police would go straight to Gale. In a way, he's perfect. A high profile alcoholic whose life was shit anyway. But...I don't know. Something. They were close. She wouldn't want him dead.Remember this thing about Dusty being a bull-horner, going to far?Right. Maybe the plan was for Dusty to release the tape after Gale's conviction, after a year or so. You know, force him to dry out, let him play the heroic victim, give him back his dignity. So, Dusty Wright's sitting on this tape, waiting, the only one who knows about it. And maybe good ole Dusty starts to think that an erroneous execution is a hell of a lot more politically useful than a last-minute save.Yeah. Almost martyrs don't count. What's one murder to stop thousands?Right. Somewhere he must have the original. What time is it?Don't move from the booth. Call the second you see the truck. Remember, let it ring just once. Then get into the woods --Into the woods, Zack.Shit!Shit!Shit!Everyone! Wake up New York, the warden, the Governor, the goddamn Supreme Court death clerk! How far is it?I'll make it.Give me the time.

Why send Gale to the chair for what looks --She had to know some innocent fuck would take the fall.Get the fuck out of here.A dead woman put the tape in your room?Thick as thieves.Hairy.She was in love with him.Why he was fired from DeathWatch, and the A.C.L.U.Which would only prove the system works.So he'll wait, release the whole tape after the execution.Let's talk about your tape...
