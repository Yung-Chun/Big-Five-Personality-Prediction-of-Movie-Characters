{"Midnight-in-Paris": {"GIL": {"raw_line": "This is unbelievable - look at this. There's no city like this in the world. There never was.Well that's just the awful era we live in but can you just imagine what this was like before - but even with all the fast food joints and the traffic - god, you just can't imagine what it was like years ago.I really do - I love cities - I love big cities with all the crowds and all the action. CUT TO:Look at these places - the streets - the boulevards.I don't get here often enough is the problem. Every once in a while for a few days is nothing - my biggest regret is that I didn't settle here the first time I came. I should have gone with my instincts.If I'd have stayed the first time I came by now I'd be a Parisian.I'm thinking of a painting by Pisarro I've seen of Paris in the rain. Can you picture how drop dead gorgeous this city is in the rain? Imagine this town in the twenties - Paris in the twenties - in the rain - the artists and writers - I was born too late. Why did God deliver me into the world in the 1970's and in Pasadena yet.It's romantic.Or Paris when it's just getting dark - the lights go on - or at night - it's great at night - or no, sunset on the Champs Elysees -Could you ever think of us moving here after we're married? CUT TO:Like?Hawaii is America.If I had stayed here and written novels and not gotten into grinding out movie scripts.But this is where all the artists came to live, to work - the writers, the painters.Boy, I'd drop the house in Beverly Hills, the pool, everything - in a heartbeat. Look - this is where Monet lived and painted - we're thirty minutes from town. Imagine the two of us settling here. If my book turns out we could do it - you could just as easily make jewelry here. CUT TO:I'm in love with you. CUT TO:What a town.I could easily see myself as a Parisien - strolling the Left Bank - a baguette under my arm - finishing my novel - at a table at the Cafe Flore. A Moveable Feast - Hemingway called it. CONTWell yes it was different then.Americans eat dinner so early.You can't say they weren't right in not backing Bush's moronic war in Iraq.There's nothing wrong with your father and I disagreeing. That's what democracy is. Your father defends the right wing of the Republican party and I happen to think they represent sub-mental Neanderthals. But we respect each other's views - am I right?Just no Wagner. When she walks down the aisle not The Ride of the Valkyries. Hey look, I just want to say that I am politically bipartisan in that, in my view, to be a politician of any party one must of necessity be a whore.Don't we have a lot of commitments?Don't we have something tomorrow? We were going to have lunch at the Brasserie Lipp. My old professor once actually saw James Joyce there. He said Joyce was eating sauerkraut and frankfurters.It is actually -Yes - but -How was I anti-social?Well they're your friends and I can't say I'm as taken with him as you are.I find him a pseudo-intellectual.I'm having trouble because I'm a Hollywood hack who never gave actual literature a real shot.I keep trying to talk her into a little attic with a skylight in Paris - CONTYes movie scripts are easier.I don't like to discuss my work.I'm afraid she's right. I just read the recent two volume biography of Rodin - Rose was definitely the wife, Camille the mistress.I did - no question. Camille- Rose.Me? Why would I read a biography of Rodin? CUT TO:To me they're all great. What the hell do I know?Pheromones, it's your pheromones. Paul and Carol have ambled over, having heard Gil's last amorous remark.You will admit she's a sexy woman.To the little green Heinz pickle pin. CUT TO:I don't want to be a party pooper but I just want fresh air.If it's okay with you, I'd really just like a little walk and go to bed. We can do it another night.You go? CaNTO:I - I - guess so CUT TO:Huh?You have the wrong person.Look, I'm a little drunk -This is a great old peugeot. I have a friend in Beverly Hills who has the same one - he collects -Where are we going?It's not fair - my head is swimming from wine.I do like champagne.I'm drinking up. He drinks, befuddled. CUT TO:You're American.Oh I - I'm a writer.Right now I'm working on a novel.California.I'm Gil Pen - oh you two have the same names as - CONTScott Fitzgerald and -Yes - its a coincidence. I mean it is a funny coincidence.I - I - I keep thinking that man at the piano - believe it or not I recognize his face from some old sheet music - what am I talking about here?Yes but - he didn't write that song - did he? That's not possible -I - I - I - I'm - I'm working on a - exactly where am I?Hey lady, are you kidding me?Gil Pender.Hemingway? Hey, is this some kind of a -Liked - I loved - everything you wrote -Ernest Hemingway - this is - I -I'm sure - good bulls, true bullsMe? I just met -Actually I don't know the Fitzgeralds that well -I do - very much.No.A novel.A man who works in a nostalgia shop.Where they sell old things - memorabilia. Does that sound terrible to you?Would you do me the biggest favor in the world - I can't even askWould you read it?It's only about four hundred pages - if you could just give me your opinion.You do?But there's no one I really trust to evaluate it -I could never compete with you - CONTNo - no - that's okay -Yes?You could have Gertrude Stein read my novel?I have to get it. It's at the hotel.I'm so thrilled - my heart is beating. I'll go home and get it - I'll give it to you - I can't tell you what this means to me. To have Gertrude Stein read my novel - thank you, thank you - He exits the place.Calm yourself - get a grip, Gil - deep breaths - been quite a night - Fitzgerald - Hemingway - the Hemingway - Papa - where do I meet him - he never said. Gil goes to return to the cafe - he can't find the door, nor the club facade. It's gone. We are in the present and he searches the wall of a facade where he came out but he is in despair over the fact he can't find it. CUT TO:Uh-huh.If I told you I was with Ernest Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald last night, what would you say?But if I wasn't dreaming -If I told you I spent time with Hemingway and Fitzgerald and Cole Porter -Can I tell you Zelda Fitzgerald is exactly as we've come to know her from articles and books - she's mercurial and moody and she does not get along with Hemingway - and Scott knows Hemingway's right about it but you can see how conflicted he is because he loves her -Actually I wanted to stay and work on my novel - it needs a little polishing.Eighteen thousand dollars?Yes but we haven't even found a house yet and I'm trying to keep expenses down so I can turn down jobs.I know you love Malibu but -Er - of course when you think of it that way it does help amortize the eighteen grand.And after I have a terrific surprise for you. CONTYou will be. Believe me.You're going on one of the most amazing adventures of your life.You'll see - you'll see - and your jaw will drop. DISSOLVE TO:Inez. CaNTO:What am I doing wrong? Unless she's right and I need to see a neurologist. Left the wine tasting - a little high yes - right here. The clock begins to chime midnight.I remember the river - the clock struck midnight - I - the clock struck midnight! Yes - On the dot of midnight I He looks at his watch which obviously confirms the chimes he hears. The period car comes - the door opens. We hear Hemingway'S voice: HEMINGWAY Get in. Gil gets in, car pulls offWeren't you scared?Getting killed.It's my biggest fear.Yes but -My fiance is very sexy.I don't know about that - CaNTO:Pender.Exceptionally lovely.Did my opening lines really get to you that strongly?Me too. I was born too late.You speak very good English.Yes - and how long have you been dating Picasso? My god, did I say that?Oh - I - no, I didn't mean anything - you know - to pry born in Paris?No, I do.Not Modigliani? Was it Modigliani? You lived with Modigliani? CONTMy god you are a whole different level of art groupie.Nothing - I'm -Actually I'm visiting.Believe me, I want to but it's not that simple.Oh that's okay - I'll drop by - it'll be easier for you - if that's okay.I only wish I could but I can't - but hopefully I'll see you again -I'm Gil Pender - I was with Hemingway and Picasso - Pablo Picasso - Ernest Hemingway - I'm Gil Pender from Pasadena - the Cub Scouts - I failed freshman English - I'm Gil Pender and my novel is with Gertrude Stein - I once worked at The House of Pies. I'm little Gil Pender. And that girl was so lovely. CUT TO:Wonderful but forgettable. I've seen that picture.Not late. I find these midnight strolls are very good for me creatively - without the distractions of the day - I'll probably take another long walk tonight.Yes - very beautiful.Love his music - we're very close - Cole, Linda and I. She gives him a look.Huh?With the same sharp guide?They say Monet used to -Er - I have to differ with you on this one.If I'm not mistaken this was a failed attempt to capture a young French girl named Adriana - from Bordeaux - if my art history serves me - came to Paris to study costume design for the theatre. Believe she had a brief affair with Modigliani - then Braque - that's where Pablo met her - er Picasso. You'd never know it from this portrait but she's quite subtly beautiful.And I'd hardly call the picture superb. It's more of a petit bourgeoise statement of how Pablo er Picasso sees her, saw her - he's distracted by the fact she was a volcano in the sack. CUT TO:I was at Gertrude Stein's - she's almost finished with my novel. And the Fitzgeralds invited me over and said you'd be here - you and Pablo.That was Djuna Barnes? No wonder she wanted to lead.Only for bargains.Would you like to maybe take a walk? CUT TO:I hope it was nothing serious with you and Pablo?I understand why they all want to paint you - you're so damn interesting to look at in a lovely way.I don't want to talk about my book. I want to enjoy Paris by night.That's putting it mildly. CUT TO:There's no book or painting, or symphony or sculpture that can rival a great city. All these streets and boulevards as a special art form. CONTYou're very kind. I would not call my babbling poetic. CUT TO:I'm ashamed to admit I'm attracted to all of them. I like cheap-sexy. I know it's shallow.Well, that's the most interesting thing I've ever heard in my life - I'd like to think about that for awhile. CUT TO:Because he believes in his soul that progress is not automatically for the better.Say - is that who I think it is?Scott loves only you. I can tell you with absolute certainty.No you're wrong. I know.Trust me. I know.Take this.A Valium - it'll calm you down.Only since Inez and I became engaged. I've had these anxiety attacks - I'm sure after the wedding they'll subside.Er - it's the pill of the future.I'll try and score some more for you. And I have some Xanax at the hotel - it's another one you'll like.Yes - I - I mean it's in the future.You'd like Inez - she has a sharp sense of humor - and she's sexy - not that we agree on everything.Actually the small things - the important things we don't - she'd like to live in Malibu and that I'd work in Hollywood - but I will say we both like - er - er Indian food - not all Indian food - pita bread - we both like pita bread -I'll walk you home - CONTNo, I wouldn't think -Yes - I remember -A rhinoceros? I never thought about it.I'm sure I look sad. I'm in a very perplexing situation.My god, I own a surrealist print - only a print by Magritte.It sounds so crazy when I say it and you'll think I'm drunk but I've got to tell someone I'm from a different time - a whole other era - the future - and I pass from the two thousandth millennium to here - a car picks me up - I slide through time -Look, you're sur-realists - but I'm a normal guy - See, in one life I'm engaged to marry a woman I love - at least I think I love her. Christ, I'm supposed to love her if I'm marrying her.In a dream - which is fine for you because you guys dabble in dreams.Adriana is her name. And I felt drawn to her - but it wouldn't matter - men much greater than me, profound artists - she's drawn to geniuses - and they to her.Of course my biggest problem is reality. BuNuEL Reality is nothing more than a dream - we all exist in the dream of a dog.I was born in the wrong time.I see an insurmountable problem.Er - some - yes - I'm beginning to think my book may be too realistic - that I've missed some chances to let my imagination run wild and not be so damn logicalC'mere - you always look great in the morning.I have to work. I'm working like a demon but I can't resist you half dressed like that.Hello - Bonjour - I'd like to ask you a question about Rodin.He loved his wife, he also loved his mistress - is it really possible to be in love with two women?God it's so French. Er - you remember me?Yeah, pedantic - perfect word. You're very observant. I need some advice. I'd like a woman's take. A French woman - an observant French woman. I met some woman that I very quickly became smitten with. Smitten?I'm engaged to be married. I know Rodin had a wife and a mistress but I'm American - we can't handle that - we're monogamous.Yes. Her name's Adriana. Right now she's living with Picas-- with a Spaniard - er he paints - fairly well. CONTLove him or me? Well I hardly think, me. But we've just met. See, another very gifted man flirts with her, a writer. All these geniuses fall in love with her. And what am I? And then of course there's another big problem. I can't exactly explain.I don't know whether to call it an age difference - or a problem of geography - I'm so messed up. I'm not Hemingway, I'm not Picasso, I'm not Rodin. I'm just a guy who was born too late. CUT TO:Thanks for stopping. Gil Pender.Tom Eliot? Tom - Stearns - T.S. Eliot? T.S. Eliot? SHOT of Gil entering car.I'm stunned, stunned - Prufrock - my mantra - As the car pulls off, we hear Gil speaking.May I tell you where I come from they measure out their lives in coke spoons. CUT TO:I didn't mean to intrude.What?They're on Mt. Kilimanjaro?Still, those sculptures -Any Cole Porter?I was kidding you realize.I'm surprised you're so familiar with his work.Yes - he was in love with your hometown. You're a Parisiene?How much.Can you translate this? Speak English? customer shrugs. Moves off. CUT TO:It's a little complicated to explain. Thanks for translating -She finds him no genius - naive and unassuming - that's not exactly dazzling.Eleven - let's see - where the hell am I going to get earrings at this hour? I must improvise. He goes to Inez's jewelry box and picks out art nouveau earrings he knows Adriana would like. He grabs a box and gift wraps it quickly. Maybe it comes in a blue velvet box and he finds some colored paper. Gil writes card: To Adriana with love. He crosses it out - To Adriana avec amour. He gives a final check to himself and opens door to leave, running smack into Inez and both her parents, home from their trip prematurely.Ohmigodl What are you doing back? CONTReally?Me? No - I was just writing.I took a break and showered. I think better in the shower. All those positive ions.That's terrible.No - sure - is there anything I can get you, John?It's nothing - nothing -Yes - yes it is. Because it's gift wrapped but er - you're not supposed to see that - it's a surprise.It's nothing great - from the flea market.No! No - not now I got it for - I mean to give it to you at a special dinner - just leave itYou didn't like the moonstones? They're understated yet elegant - Don't you always say that, ha, ha .. CONTI thought you'd like their simplicity.You probably didn't pack them.I guess you lost them. They probably dropped off.Gee I wouldn't jump to any conclusions. I mean an accusation of theft.Oh god -The maid was very sweet.Look! Look! Are these what you're missing?They were in the bathroom.Right out on the sink.Well you're under stressMaybe you thought you put them away and left them out or dropped them, and the maid found them and left them out where you could see them easily.The main thing is they're not stolen.Five hundred francs? For a Matisse? CONTOh er - I brought a rewrite of the first few chapters of my book and was hoping you would tell me if you thought I was on the right track.Er - have you heard from Hemingway?By herself?I came to find you. CONTLet's just say as a writer I see into women's souls and I sense that you have very complicated feelings towards me.I'm not so sure about anything anymore - can we just go where it's quiet? They are almost out the door when they run into Luis Bufiuel.Oh, Mr. Bufiuel, I had a nice idea for a movie for you. BuNuEL Yes?A group of people are at a formal dinner party and after dinner when they try to leave the room, they can't. BuNuEL Why not?They just can't seem to exit the door. BuNuEL But why?And because they're all forced to stay together the veneer of civilization quickly comes off them and they behave as who they really are - animals. BuNuEL But I don't get it - why don't they just walk out of the room? CONTJust think about it - that's all I'm saying - maybe one day you'll be shaving and it'll tickle your fancy. They go off as Bufiuel gets in last line. BuNuEL I don't understand - what's holding them in the room? CUT TO:I don't know but I do know that for a brief moment, when I was doing it, I felt - immortal.Because life is too mysterious for me.I've always been a logical person. I never took chances - did anything crazy - like move here when I first came or take a shot at being a real writer, not a Hollywood hired hand - but I feel like letting everything go. Gil gives her earrings. CaNTO:Here.What's going on? They get in.I don't know what it is about this city but I must write a thank you note to the chamber of commerce.The present - Yes, the present always seems worse than the past but it can't be - to always think this generation is stupider and coarser than the last - and yet - here we are at Maxims tonight and yes, it's fabulous.We shouldn't bother him.This much French I know.I'm American. Oui -Yes, I love your pictures too.Parlez Anglais?Er - yes - Monsieur Lauren - Ralph. Shouldn't you be in Tahiti?I wouldn't get into too many details with them. Let's just leave it that we're temporarily passing through.What are you talking about?But I love the Jazz Age.But what happened to the twenties and the Charleston and Cole Porter?It's not the present for me - I'm from 2010.I dropped in on you just the way we dropped in on the 1890's.I wanted to escape my present just like you wanted to escape yours. To a golden age.To me they are.Yes but don't you see - to these guys the golden age was the Renaissance. They'd all trade the Belle Epoque to paint alongside Michelangelo or Titian. And those guys probably imagine life was better when Kubla Khan was around. I'm having an insight. A minor one but that accounts for the anxiety of my dream.Last night I dreamed I ran out of zithromax - and then I went to the dentist and there was no novacaine - these people have no antibiotics -And even in the twenties - no dishwashers - no 911 if your appendix bursts - no \"movies on demand\"Because if you stay here and this becomes your present, sooner or later you'll imagine another time was really the golden time. And so will I - I'm beginning to see why it can't work, Adriana. The present has a hold on you because it's your present and while there's never any progress in the most important things, you get to appreciate - what little progress is made - the internet - Pepto- Bismol. The present is always going to seem unsatisfying because life itself is unsatisfying - that's why Gauguin goes back and forth between Paris and Tahiti, searching - it's my job as a writer to try and come up with reasons why despite life being tragic and unsatisfying, it's still worth it.Yes, that one I regretted but it was a real choice and I made the wrong one. This is a choice between accepting reality or surreal insanity. CONTNo - I love you - but this way lies madness - and if I'm ever going to write anything worthwhile I've got to get rid of my illusions and that I'd be happier in the past is one of them.Goodbye Adriana. Good luck. They kiss, she turns and goes to the table of artists. CUT TO:Thank you. I can't tell you how much this means to me.Hemingway read it? What was his suggestion? CaNTO:with -It's called denial. Thanks again. You're Ezra Pound right? T.S. Eliot says you owe him forty francs. CUT TO:From Ernest Hemingway. He thought it out and it makes perfect sense.There's nothing crazy about Ernest Hemingway or Gertrude Stein or Fitzgerald or Salvador Dali -It was William Faulkner who said, the past is not dead.I guess I'm too trusting. I'm jealous and also trusting - cognitive dissonance, Scott Fitzgerald speaks of it.I know it Inez - you can fool me but not Hemingway.I'm not going back.I'm staying here. It's not the romantic fling. Paris is Paris. It's that I'm not in love with you.A lot has happened to me since we got here. I won't begin to bore you - but - I know what that feeling of love is and it's not us. CONTI was attracted to another woman but it was the whole deal - meeting Gertrude Stein and Hemingway and Dali and Scott and Zelda -If I'm not happy I'll move back. But right now I'm going to stay.You're better off without me.Goodbye Inez. He goes.Hey, I know you - the girl at the flea market.What are you doing here?What's your name?Gabrielle, - I'm Gil - I just moved to Paris this week.Can I walk along with you or can I buy you a coffee? Oh god, it's starting to rain.Oh what a thing to say. I couldn't agree more.Hey what are those bells?

Versailles is beautiful - I have to see it Gil - it's perfect for you with your obsession with \"les temps perdus\"I hope you're not going to be as anti-social tomorrow when we go to Versailles.It was so clear you didn't want to go.He's brilliant. I used to have such a crush on him at college. And Carol's very bright.I hardly think the Sorbo nne would have him lecturing if he's a pseudo- intellectual. You should give him your novel to read. I'm sure he'd be able to critique your writing and show you why you're having so much trouble.Gil, promise me if this book doesn't come off you'll give up beating your brains out and get back to what you do best. CONTI think I could get used to a summer home like this.We're looking in Malibu. We love where you live.He doesn't even know if he can write a novel. So far your track record's - you know - whereas, everyone likes your movies -Tell them about the lead character in the book you're working on.Not the plot, just the lead character. He works in a nostalgia shop.People who live in the past. Who think their lives would have been happier if they lived in an earlier time.Paris in the twenties - in the rain - when the rain wasn't acid rain.He's a romantic. Gil would be just fine living in a perpetual state of denial.Touche.I love a diamond wedding band. The way it sparkled they'll see it in the last row when he puts it on my finger.I don't want to keep going over it, Mom.Gil's smart and successful.The world is full of people who dream of writing the great American novel. Let me handle him.He likes to please me - is that so terrible? Oh gosh - I have to go - Paul arranged a private tour of the Rodin Museum. CUT TO:He's so knowledgeable, isn't he?Don't forget, Dad invited you to join us at a wine tasting tonight.When did you read the biography of Rodin?I can't tell the difference. They're both delicious.Which do you prefer?I don't think I've ever seen your cheeks so red.Sure.Oh come on - although if you're just going to sit there and obsess over where the fire exits are.Well I can go, right?I'm not tired and I'm dying to dance. I'll just meet you back at the hotel.Isn't it great we're all on holiday at the same time.I can't introduce him to tennis - Daddy's having the damndest time pressuring him to learn golf.He won't let anybody -That's what he needs, to have it read by someone who really knows and wouldn't pull any punches. The problem is - when it comes to his writing he has no respect for anyone's opinion. CUT TO:Lucky you didn't go last night. You'd have hated the music and the crowd - but I had fun.What are you thinking? You seem in a daze.Is that what you were dreaming about? Your literary idols.What does that mean? CaNTO:I'd be thinking brain tumor.Right, right - er where's my cold cream - we should knock off the idle chatter because we're going to be late.You can work on it later. And we can use Mom's decorator's discount. CUT TO:That's over twenty thousand dollars, Mom.She's right, Gil.Did you ever make love in a chaise like this? Imagine the possibilities.Great.What? I'm not big on surprises.Where are you taking me? You made me rush through dinner. Dad wasn't finished with his profiteroles.Where? And why are you carrying around your manuscript.I don't know what it is you're carrying on about but this is not my idea of an amazing adventure. I'm exhausted from the gym and the massage.Look - you want to walk the streets and \"drink in Paris by night\" - go ahead. I'm in the middle of a great book Carol lent me and if I'm asleep when you get in, don't wake me.What time did you get in? I was dead asleep.We'll see. Oh how about this? CONTGil - Gil - Gil?We should go. We're meeting Paul and Carol for a private showing at the museum.It's a different museum and we don't need a guide. Paul's an expert on Monet.I prefer Monet. I mean I love Turner but this is overwhelming.Shhh. I want to hear what Paul's saying.Gil pay attention and you'll learn something.What have you been smoking?Work - he likes to walk around Paris - the way the city is all lit up at night allegedly inspires him - It's okay. Paul and I are going dancing.In bed with a bad oyster. See you later. Thanks for dinner Dad.Did you get much work done last night?Shouldn't we be getting dressed?We'll be late.Paul says we have to see the countryside. He's taking us for lunch at this beautiful little inn. I know you like making love in the morning but I find it much sexier late afternoon - just before we go out to dinner. Except I always have to explain to my parents why your cheeks look radiant. Hey- I'm not going to force you. I know you're hot on your writing. I'll be happy when you finish this book and move on. CUT TO:I forgot to tell you. Gil is not going with us to Mont St. Michel.He writes, he rewrites, he rewrites his rewrites. He says Picasso never left his studio. CONTDaddy got chest pains.Daddy had an angioplasty three years ago.Why are you so dressed up?You dress and put on cologne to write?We were halfway to Mont. St. Michele and Daddy started to look pale.We turned right around. CONTWhat's this.What is that? It's a present.You got me something?Let me open it.Now I'm dying of curiosity. If it's jewelry I hope it's my taste - not like the moonstone necklace.You never saw the necklace he got me. I've never actually worn it. You'll see why immediately. Opens her jewelry box, holds up moonstones.That's just it, they're too simple.Hey - where are my art nouveau earrings?I've worn them here.Both of them? My ears are pierced.You think it was the maid?I remember seeing them there this morning. CONTI'll bet it was that maid. She was so snotty yesterday about turning out the beds. She goes to phone.I want to report a theft. I'd like the house detective to please come to room 818.I didn't like that maid from the first day, didn't I say that? Door rings.Right. Take the side of the help as usual. That's why Dad calls you a Communist.Where did you find them?The bathroom?Why the hell would they be in the bathroom?I didn't drop them or leave them out ...You're crazy - Paul and me? Where did you get such an insane notion?Gil, your brain tumor's acting up again.Nothing except they've all been dead for years.You're a raving lunatic.Gil -Jesus Christ I'm dealing with a madman - okay - Paul and I had a few nights alone. We danced, we drank - you were always working - he's very attractive, he spoke to me in French - the whole mystique of this corny city got to me - it's over. We can put this all in perspective at home.What?What?Have you met someone else? All those late night walks.Honey, you better listen to yourself. You're a psycho. You don't know what you're doing. You see everything here through magical colored glasses. You're a California film writer with a house in Beverly Hills with two Mercedes'. You're not some kind of twenties expatriate novelist. Her parents enter from the adjoining suite.With who? All your crazy hallucinatory friends? Mother was right about you - there's a part missing.Anyone who's protagonist makes a living selling old cap pistols and Joan Crawford cut out books.Go ahead. Walk the streets - gush over the Parisian light and the rooftops.
