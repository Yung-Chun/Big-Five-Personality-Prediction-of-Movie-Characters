Let's go!Actually, no, she's a complete psycho. That's why she's up at Pescedero. She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.Yeah, she's a total loser. C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?Whoa... time out. Stop the bike!Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?No way!Holy shit... you're really real! I mean... whoah! You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?This in intense. Get a grip, John. Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself. So what's the deal?Yeah? Who sent you?This is deep.So this other guy? He's a terminator too, right, like you?What does that mean?Radical.Where we going?Can I stop by my house?You sure?Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks but I gotta warn them. Shit! You got a quarter?Janelle? It's me.Something's wrong. She's never this nice.The dog's really barking. Maybe it's already there. What should I do?Max.I need a minute here, okay? You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that. For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns. Then there were some other guys. She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from. So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader. Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho. Didn't you know? It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that. But everything she said was true. We gotta get her out of there.Oh, great. And what happens to her?TERMINATED!? Shit! Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!Hey, goddammit! What's your problem?Help! HELP!! I'm being kidnapped! Get this psycho off of me!Let go of me!!Oww! Why'd you do that?You have to do what I say?!Prove it... stand on one foot.Cool! My own terminator. This is great!Take a hike, bozo.Dipshit? Did you say dipshit?! Grab this guy.Now who's the dipshit, you jock douchebag?Put the gun down! NOW!!Walk away.Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!Listen to me, very carefully, okay? You're not a terminator any more. Alright? You got that? You can't just go around killing people!Whattaya mean, why? 'Cause you can't!You just can't, okay? Trust me on this.Look, I'm gonna go get my mom. You wanna come along, that's fine with me.Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?Swear.Just say \"I swear I won't kill anyone.\"Mom!! Wait!Mom, are you okay?It's all right, Mom. He's here to help.Can you see anything?Cool.I said I was okay.I... had to get you out of the place... I'm sorry, I...Does it hurt?How long do you live? I mean, last?Can you learn? So you can be... you know. More human. Not such a dork all the time.Can we reset the switch?Can you see the pin switch?No!!!!No! Don't kill him!Alright, it! We need it!But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while. 'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.No problem. None whatsoever.Are we learning yet?No, no, no. You gotta listen to the way people talk. See, you don't say like \"Affirmative\" or some shit like that. You say... no problemo.It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say \"eat me\"... if you wanna shine them on, it's \"Hasta la vista, baby\".Yeah, or \"later, dickwad.\" Or if someone gets upset you say \"chill out.\" Like that. Or you can do combinations.That's great! See, you're getting it.Only a couple hundred bucks. I'll give you half.No sense of humor.And that's another thing. You could lighten up a bit, yourself. This severe routine is getting old. Smile once in a while.Yeah. Smile. You know. People smile, right? Watch.Hi. Nice place you got here. How's business?Okay. Bad example. Over there, look.Like that.I don't know, maybe you could practice in front of a mirror or something.We're not gonna make it, are we? People, I mean.Yeah. Drag, huh?He's cool, Enrique. He's... uh... this is my Uncle Bob. Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.Hook it on.One thing about my mom... she always plans ahead.Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.See, I grew up in places like this, so I just thought it was how people lived... riding around in helicopters. Learning how to blow shit up.Then, when Mom got busted I got put in a regular school. The other kids were, like, into Nintendo.Are you ever afraid?Not even of dying?You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?Yeah. I have to stay functional too. \"I'm too important\".It's definitely you.There was this one guy that was kinda cool. He taught me engines. Hold this a second. Mom screwed it up, of course. Sooner or later she'd always tell them about Judgment Day and me being this world leader and that's be all she wrote.Here. I wish I coulda met my real dad.Yeah. I guess so. My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984. But right now he hasn't even been born yet. Man, is messes with your head. Where's that other bolt? Thanks. Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess. I see her crying sometimes. She denies it totally, of course. Like she says she got something in her eye.You mean people? I don't know. We just cry. You know. When it hurts.Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway. You get it?Alriight!! My man!Mommm!! Wait!!\"No fate.\" No fate but what we make. My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind. Okay, the whole thing goes \"The future is not set. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves.\"I guess, yeah -- Oh shit!!Yeah, gotta be! Miles Dyson! She's gonna blow him away!Come on. Let's go. LET'S GO!!Drive faster.I don't care. We've gotta stop her.I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?! Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?Look, maybe you don't care if you live or die. But everybody's not like that! Okay?! We have feelings. We hurt. We're afraid. You gotta learn this stuff, man, I'm not kidding. It's important.Shit, we're too late!Mom? You okay?Uh huh.It's okay. It'll by okay. We'll figure it out.I know, Mom. I know.Show him.Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue. She's still tense. We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening. Right?You guys get started on the lab... I can open this.Easy money.I got it. Piece of cake.Remember what I said, you can't...And let's see what's behind door number one.Got ol' Skynet by the ball now, Miles. Come on, let's book!Ready to rock?Mommm!!!Don't forget. It's always darkness right before... you're totally fucked.Faster! He's right on us!Where you going?!Okay, Mom, we gotta get out now, come on. That's it.What?Come on! Let's go!Come on, Mom, you can do it! Come on!!Come on, you gotta try... please, Mom. Get up!Mom! MOMMM!!SHOOT!!!!Is it dead?Will it melt in there?No!No, no no!! It'll be okay.

How's the knee?You take it.I'm not taking it. Now I don't want any trouble...You... son of a... AAARRGH!!Kyle..? You're dead.Oh. Yeah. They... make me take this stuff...Hold me.Oh, God... Kyle. I need you so much.They took him from me.I know!I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be. I can't do it. I'm screwing up the mission.Kyle, don't go!I was afraid... and confused. I feel much better, now. Clearer.It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months. Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.They don't exist. I see that now.If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.So what do you think, Doctor? I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?You have to let me see my son. Please. It's very important. He's in danger. At least let me call him --YOU SON OF A BITCH!!Goddammit. Let me go!! Silberman! You don't know what you're doing! You fuck! You're dead! You hear me!!There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one. Now don't move!Open it or he'll be dead before he hits the floor.You're already dead, Silberman. Everybody here dies. You know I believe that. So don't fuck with me!Step back!Down on the floor! Now!No! Help me! Goddamnit, it's gonna kill us all!!!Out of the car!!RIGHT NOW!You okay?It was stupid of you to go there.Goddamnit, John, you have to be smarter than that. You're too important! You can't risk yourself, not even for me, do you understand? I can take care of myself. I was doing fine. Jesus, John. You almost got yourself killed.Stop it! Right now! You can't cry, John. Other kids can afford to cry. You can't.So what's your story?This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?Can it be destroyed?Pull in here. We have to ditch this car.You look like handmade shit.I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?Will these heal up?That's good. Because if you can't pass for human, you won't be much good to us.Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?Out of the way, John!It, John. Not him. It.We're better off by ourselves.I don't trust it! These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know. We may never have this opportunity again.Just head south.Keep it under sixty-five. We can't afford to be pulled over.You got any cash?Get some food.I need to know how Skynet get built. Who's responsible?Why him?Then what?Uh huh, great. Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?And Skynet fights back.Why attack Russia?Jesus. How much do you know about Dyson?I want to know everything. What he looks like. Where he lives. Everything.Stay in the truck.Enrique? You here?I just came for my stuff. And I need clothes, food, and one of your trucks.Now, Enrique. You two are on weapons detail.Yeah. I'm gonna wait till dark to cross the border. Enrique, it's dangerous for you here. You get out tonight, too, okay?Watching John with the machine, it was suddenly so clear. The Terminator would never stop, it would never leave him... it would always be there. And it would never hurt him, never shout at him or get drunk and hit him, or say it couldn't spend time with him because it was too busy. And it would die to protect him. Of all the would-be fathers who came and went over the years, this thing, this machine, was the only one who measured up. In an insane world, it was the sanest choice.... if we are ever separated, and can't make contact, go to Enrique's airstrip. I'll rendezvous with you there.Don't fucking move! Don't FUCKING MOVE!! Get on the floor, bitch! Now!! Fucking down! NOW!!Shut up, kid! Get out of the way!!Shut up! SHUT UP!! Motherfucker! It's all your fault! IT'S YOUR FAULT!!I couldn't... oh, God. You... came here... to stop me?I love you, John. I always have.Dyson listened while the Terminator laid it all down. Skynet. Judgment Day... the history of things to come. It's not every day you find out you're responsible for 3 billion deaths. He took it pretty well, considering...Yeah. Right. How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons. Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man? Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men. Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up. You're so creative. You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life. To feel it growing inside you. All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.That's not good enough.What chip?Son of a bitch, I knew it!Those lying motherfuckers!Can you get us in there, past security?Is it safe for them here?The future, always so clear to me, has become like a black highway at night. We were in uncharted territory now... making up history as we went along.Don't even think about it.NO!! We're going all the way! You got that, Dyson?John! Fire-in-the-hole!Go! I'll finish here.Ready.Dyson, hand me the detonator. Let's go --John, get under these. Hurry!John? John? Can you hear me? Where are you?Help me, honey...John, get out of the way!!It's finally over.Are you afraid?August 29th 1997 came and went. Nothing much happened. Michael Jackson turned forty. There was no Judgment Day. People went to work as they always do, laughed, complained, watched TV, made love.I wanted to run down the street yelling... to grab them all and say \"Every day form this day is a gift. Use it well!\" Instead I got drunk.That was thirty years ago. But the dark future which never came still exists for me, and it always will, like the traces of a dream lingering in the morning light. And the war against the machines goes on. Or, to be more precise, the war against those who build the wrong machines.John fights the war differently than it was foretold. Here, on the battlefield of the Senate, the weapons are common sense... and hope.The luxury of hope was given to me by the Terminator.
