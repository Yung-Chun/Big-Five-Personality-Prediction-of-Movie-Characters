{"Manhattan-Murder-Mystery": {"LARRY": {"raw_line": "Come on.You promised to sit through the entire hockey game without being bored and I'll sit through the Wagner opera with you next week.I already bought the earplugs.God. I can't wait to get into bed and stretch out.You know, there's a Bob Hope movie on television later.Really ? Well, it's an alternative lifestyle.I prefer to atrophy. I'm not a very exercise person.Because you have to turn it on and get on it once in a while. That was her problem.There's a movie on television I want to watch.Yeah.Uh, it's hard for me.That tiny thing there ?Ah, you have a really...Yes.Well, listen... we're probably keeping you up, right ?I should be going.Me ? I'm in book publishing. I work up at Harper's.Yeah.Oh.Where's Carol ?Because I should really be going, actually.Yeah. I mean, so, we...Oh, coffee. I forgot coffee.You know, it's amazing how time, we,... we'll just...Oh, she's a great cook, though, really. Her duck and fennel omelette on a bed of scallops and Hollandaise sauce with truffles and sweetbreads'll make you snap into a fetal position and have you in bed screaming for a month.Well, it's... I always think a Bentley is in good taste. You know, or you can go the route that I went with her. On her twentieth, I got her some very lovely handkerchiefs.Yeah, it was a very, very high-class item. I didn't even know her size. I'm going over. Carol bursts out laughing.Jesus, couldn't you keep the conversation going a little longer in there ?I was signaling you frantically.Neighborly ? If this guy showed me his stamp collection one more time... I mean, my favorite thing in life is to, you know, look at canceled postage.Oh, and I'm looking forward to seeing that Bob Hope movie. I don't know why they put it on so late.No, we should be as lucky as them. To, you know, to be in their physical shape, at their age ? They look great. Did you see the dumbbells this guy lifts ? If I lifted dumbbells like those, I would get a hernia the size of the San Andrea's Fault.I don't think you have to worry about that.So what do you want to do ? you guys gonna browse, or...Yeah, I... I... it was one of my favorites.It just... they were all so wonderful, in the picture.Ted ?Well, I don't know. Ted... I always thought Ted had a crush on you.Yeah. Why are you so stunned ? I think that...Uh. Now he's divorced, you know ?What's the matter ? What's going on ? What happened ?Sh-We just met her last night.Oh, my God.Th-Th-Th-The first time we saw them was last night. We just met them. W-We had... They invited us in for coffee.You look wonderful.If there's anything we can do. You know, anything you need, just tell us and we'll...Yeah.Ah.If there's anything we can do.You know, if you need anything, if you are lonely, come by. You know.My favorite, my favorite.Goodnight.Come, we're gonna be late.I can't listen to that much Wagner, you know. I start to get the urge to conquer Poland.No, no, not this... you gotta, you gotta see this guy. This guy gets his jollies from licking the back of postage stamps. He's a-a boring old...Well, what is she gonna say ? Oh, yeah, hello, I'm Mrs. House and I have a bad heart.So, she had one too many.So she wasn't on a diet. But...I like a... It's disgusting.It's disgusting, but a... It's fatal.Really ?What are you encouraging her for ? It's so...I know, but...Do you know how time-consuming it is ? Yeah. You have to be there every night.You'd be stuck there, you know.They steal from, if you're not... You gotta be hap...Right. Directs...You know, I was thinking of fixing Ted up with Helen Dubin. You know, I figured they would just, you know, get into an argument over penis envy, or something.The poor guy suffers from it so...No, he seemed like his regular self to me, but-but, uh, when you brought up the notion of the restaurant... the guy lit up like Mr. Glowworm.Yeah. He sees himself as, uh, you know, as Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca. I-I see him more as Peter Lorre, wringing his hands. Carol starts walking toward the other section of the room. The camera follows her.Right. Meanwhile, I can't get the-the Flying Dutchman theme out of my mind, you know ? Remind me tomorrow to buy up all the Wagner records in town and rent a chainsaw.Yeah ?Well, he's a little mousey, too. They could have their little rodent time. They can eat cheese together.Oh, Christ.Hallo ? Yes. Yes, of.... Yes, of course you woke us. You know, not everybody's up at one o'clock in the morning watching the porn channel. I'll put her on.Ted. For you.Jesus, are you onto that ? My God, I thought you were just joking.Let me speak to him, all right ?Hey, listen. She was not murdered. She... she had a heart attack. It was a coronary. There was a doctor there. He said to.... He was an old man.I'm not gonna touch that. I'm tired. I want to go to sleep. Look...Oh, no. She made these just for you. This is...They're only half a dozen.She worked on those for... How're you holding up ?Uh uh, so you have someone to go with, or are you...Oh, really ?Good. It's a good idea.Snorkeling ? No, no. I get nervous when brightly colored fish are staring at me face to face, you know.Oh, stamps. Well, that's...Uh-huh. Yes, yes. We were. We were spending the eternity with the beloved. I sound like... I sound like one of those guys, now.What was all that stuff about twin cemetery plots ?You know ? I mean, we-we never discussed it at all, but I knew that you were trying to tell me something, so I picked up on it quickly.But I... You know, we...Ashes ? Funeral ashes ? Did you wash your hands ?How did you know it was her, for Christ's sake ? They were ashes. What, did they resemble Mrs. House ?Anybody. Could it be, an associate, an old relative, his accountant, his cat. Who knows ?What do you mean? Th-th-the guy didn't do anything.Oh, Jesus. Leave the guy alone. You know, he-he... he's a poor widower, he wants to go on a vacation or something.So what ? Different strokes. You know, he has fun, uh, sitting at the bottom of the water, face to face with squid.Too much \u00abDouble Indemnity\u00bb, you know ?Jesus, you're up to poisons already. You guys are slipping into a mad obsession.Let's go to bed. Could we go to bed, now ?What do you mean, \u00abYou're not tired\u00bb ?Great.Well, New York is a melting pot. You know, get used to it.Hey, are you okay ?Yeah ? You're sure ?So-So-So what ?So what ? It's not a crime. He can get on the elevator.Oh, Jesus. I was in a deep sleep. What-What's the difference ?All right, so it was Mr. House. So he got on the elevator. It's not a felony. The guy pays rent. He's entitled. I mean, what... Can you go back to bed ? This is crazy. You woke me up out of a deep sleep. I gotta get up early tomorrow morning.Don't ring Mr... What are you doing ? No, don't ring...Don't ring Mr. house. This is a widower. Leave the poor guy alone. You're crazy. Stop it. Carol listens to the phone.So you saw him go out. It's not a-not a crime.Give me this. Give me this.Look, if you want to find out if somebody left, just call downstairs. Call the-the-the person at the desk.Ask if someone went out.Yeah, um. Sure, I'm gonna keep ringing. You got it.Okay. Are you happy ?Now, can we back to bed ?For crying out loud, it's no big deal. You're making a mystery where nothing exists.You know, I'm gonna...I wanna go to sleep. I don't want to be standing here in the middle of the night.Oh, great ! Great ! So what ? Now, what've you got ?So what ? So what ?What's the big deal ? So, the next-door neighbor went out in the middle of the night and took his car. So, he went someplace.That's all.I mean, so you're right. So big deal.But this kind of right is gonna put us in the toilet. So, you're right. You're suspicious.It says more about your mind that about him.Get into bed. Get into bed.You're so... What's wrong with you ? Jesus !So, I thought your rewrites were great. I really think you helped your book, you know ? It's... It's dense a little bit, but, uh...That's... That's something you're never gonna have to worry about, you know ? This book makes \u00abFinnegan's Wake\u00bb look like airplane reading, you know ? But-But it's long. It's- It's-It's...No, I'm not pushing it. I think the book is great. Absolutely great. You know, but, uh... how much, how much of Dorothy is you? As I was reading it, I kept thinking how much is... you know, how much did you base it on your own life ? They have now reached a smaller room, actually Larry's private room. Marcia takes her glasses off, and then her coat, and sits on a sofa.Oh, really ? Do you still play ?Yes ? Are you good ?Yeah, because maybe you could give me some pointers.Could you ? That's great. That's... you know, you-you have all these skills, and you're beautiful, and you can write so well... and now it turns out you play poker. This is, uh, too good to be true.Okay, you sold me. Are-are you seeing anybody ?Because I have a friend who became single recently, and I-I know he would get a big kick out of you.Uh, next week. I could take you to lunch. We could-we could, um, I'll put you on my expense account, and you could... teach me when to... bet and when to fold.Now ? That's a possibility. Larry picks up the phone from a small table.You know, we could, we could do... Hallo. Yes ? Where are you ?I could. Yeah. I need-I need, you know, five minutes, or so. Okay. Yes. Yes. I know where it is. Okay, hold on.I can't do it. I have to... My wife, I have a little thing I have to do. I'll do the cheeseburger with you next week, or something.What do you mean, you snuck into his apartment ? Are you nuts ?A fuddy-dud ?What are you talking about ? That's a crime. You can't do that. You... That's-That's burglary and breaking and entering. But... What has gotten into you lately ? For crying out loud, save a little craziness for menopause.Hey, look. Do... I don't want to... You-You'll wind up rooming with John Gotti. You can't do that. You can't just steal the key and then go into somebody's apartment.I don't wanna know. I don't wanna be an accessory.Tell Ted. I don't want to know. Leave me alone.I-I don't wanna hear. Leave me alone. Don't tell me.How do you know ?He did ?You hid under his bed ?I cannot believe this. My stomach is curdling, here I...But what would you have done if he, if he found you out ?That far ahead ? You're talking two seconds.He could have looked under the bed and there you are. What do you...I don't wanna know. Leave me alone.Yeah, yeah. I... I know, I get it, his name is Paul, but I don't care. I don't wanna hear.I just don't...What ?And you can divide it up and we can all have some.You'll really like this dessert.Yeah, that's great.No.No, no, those aren't yours. These are the same, actually. They are, aren't they ? These-These-These ones, are.At your mother's house.Kicked under, right, because what she'll do, she'll drop...She'll always drop things and she'll kick them all around the house.She's always-She's always kick...Yes, really ? Remember there was the time you kicked the mousse under the bed in the house. Remember that ? It was...It took-took six months to get the...What's the matter ?Oh, Geez, I was...I was fast asleep. I was dreaming of round card girls.Oh, Christ. Not that again. Please, you know...What are you talking about ? Where're you going ?It's-It's one o'clock in the morn...What ? What ?What-What're you doing ? You got his key ?You're kidding. What are you talking about ? You can't do... Why... because you-you followed him to the movie house, you-you said there was nothing happening.Well, so what ? That's the...What... Hey, listen to me. Come here.Come here. Wait a minute. Come here. Look, look.I've been thinking about you.I think you gotta see... I gotta... You gotta, you gotta go back to your shrink.I want you to see Doctor Ballard again.I'm s... Yeah. I know. But you...You know how General Motors will recall defective cars ? Well, you gotta go in for a tune-up.You got... No. No.I... What... I'm telling you, I'm your husband. I command you to sleep !Sleep ! I command it !I command it ! Sleep !Uh, yes. The country house. The bluebird. I know.But that, though, was a sweet mystery. This is murder.No, I... Yeah, look, no, I-I forbid you ! I forbid you to go! It's a-a... I'm forbidding ! Is that what you do when I forbid you ? If-If that's what you... I'm not going to be forbidding you a lot, if you do...Don't do this. We should be asleep, now, in one of our many cuddling positions.This is wrong.This is no good. I promise you, this could only lead to great unhappiness.Pl... I can't relax. How can I relax ? I'm in a strange man's apartment in my, in my T-shirt and-and pajamas.What do you mean, Ted told you ? Who... Ted ? Ted ? What is he, your mentor ?Ted is a sick schmuck. He's-He's home, and we're in...I mean, I'm... What if he comes back ? I'm... My heart is....Hang the phone up.Hang the phone up, now.Good, good.Let's get out. I wanna go home. I want to go back to bed.Run a check on it ? What, do you want to beat it down to the morgue ? You got all the jargon.Where are you going ?I'm not a night person. I don't wanna be... What are you... I don't know what I'm looking for.What ? What do you wanna do, go through the guy's mail ? This is insane.Oh, my... As he takes some more letters, Larry hits a small porcelain statuette, and drops it on the floor, where it breaks. He bends down to pick up the debris.Jesus. Oh, Christ !What do you mean, clean it up ? What am I gonna do, vacuum ?I can't. It's a wall-to-wall carpet. I broke his-his-his- his... porcelain...What do you mean, glue it ? What are you talking about ?What ?So what ? Gloves. I have gloves. They keep my fingers warm.Let's get out of here, because this is a...It's eye of the beholder. What you have... you've got to go to the eye doctor, get happy glasses.Look, I'm gonna take the pieces with us, and we'll-we'll get rid of them.Right.If only he could stay in town-If only could stay in town just a couple of more hours.I'm gonna take him to Brooks Brothers for his present. And- And-And, uh...Your mother's going to a wine-tasting.She's going to a wine-tasting. Can you believe that ?Hi. Hey, I want you to meet somebody.I want you to meet somebody. This is, this is...Hi. How are you ?This is my wife.You snuck around.Yeah. This is Marcia Fox.My son Nick. He's in town on, uh...It's his birthday, so we took him to Twenty-One.It's a tradition we have in the family.Oh, I fixed her up with Ted. He's going to take her...Yeah. That place that we ate at.He's a lot of fun. You'll have a very good time.That's great. So.Oh, it's great. She'll have a great time.S-So, what are you making a face for ? She's great.Ted's type ?She's anybody's type. She's brilliant, she's talented. Yeah. I gave you...You get your bag.No, she's dangerously sexual.Let me tell you... Listen, when you go to the wine-tasting, honey...Getting back to real life, spit it out. Okay ? When you drink...Yeah, spit... And spit it out.They spit it out at a wine-tasting, you know what I mean ? Because, yeah. I don't want you to be lying on the bathroom floor with your head by the bowl tonight, you know ?I got a great sweater at Brooks Brothers' today for Nick, today.What ?Oh, Jesus. You're not about Mrs. House again. I thought we'd have a light dinner, you know, because we had a rich lunch at Twenty-One, I thought.Uh, the dead woman passed you on a bus ? Which bus was this, the bus to heaven ?Uh-huh. Uh-huh.You want to lie down for a while ? We'll put a cold compress on your head, or a hot compress on your back, or...Remember I said to you ? Yes, remember I said to you, spit it out ?I said don't drink it. You said you were going to a wine- tasting ?You said you were going to taste wine all afternoon ? I said spit it out ?I said don't swallow it ? You swallowed it. And that's why you're this way.Yeah, I 'm sure you saw her.How could you see her ? She's dead. Not only is she dead, she's been cremated. It's not even Halloween.I think it's a pretty fair assumption that if a person is dead, they don't suddenly turn up in the New York City transit system.What's going on ?Let me put it this way : total psychotic breakdown. Okay ? Is that enough ?Maybe, look. Maybe she's a twin. That's possible. Now forget this.Taste my tuna casserole. Tell me if I put in too much hot fudge.Oh, Ted. Ted.She wasn't murdered. It was a coronary. It was a coronary, folks. It was a coronary. She wasn't murdered. I don't know what they're talking about.He was at the wine tasting, too. Sure, why not.They're both at the wine tasting.Don't run a check. Don't run a check.Stop.Listen, could you call back later, because my marriage is falling apart.Forget it. Will you ? If you're gonna have an affair with the guy, you don't need a murder to do it.Yes, I know, on the bus, the dead persons' bus. No car fare.Now, sit down. Let's...Yeah, I'm not going to see the exact spot.No, I've got a business lunch tomorrow. I got...No, I got a business lunch. I'm not interested.Hm ? I'm not interested. Come on, will you...Will you eat something ? We've got tickets to the theatre.Tell them your story. Tell them this whole cockamamie story.That's right. That's right, you've got nothing.Yeah, okay, good. Now, will you sit down because we're going to the theater. I don't care what you say.Oh, Jack ? Jack ? You-you were there when Mrs. House died, right? You saw her ?Hey, he said it was lying on the floor. Right. Right. You know, I... He's sure. He's sure. He's sure.My-My-My wife's been having some bad dreams, and she doesn't know what she's talking about.Yeah, this is, this is for all the times I call you to fix the faucet, and you show up six months late.Yeah, but...If she's a twin, it's a different story. But you don't seem to feel she is, so...Who's in on it ? The super ? The super can't change a fuse.What ?She's not alive, unless she's a twin. Okay ? Now keep quiet...Shut up.So...I-I never go out. I-I-I-I-I just, I can't take... I can't...No, no, no. I'm just probably just a little drunk.No. What are you talking about ? I had rum cake.Uh, one second. Just let me, let me see, see what I, possibilities I got here. Uh, yeah. I'm gonna have, uh... I'll have, uh... I'm gonna have four cards.Yeah.Inside and outside straight. Marcia looks at her cards. Larry keeps shuffling his cards very nervously.You know, I can't escape the feeling that my-my wife is becoming attracted to somebody else... and it's really bothering me.Yeah. That's why I'm not playing my best. This guy is, you know, more adventurous than I am, and for some reason they just seem to hit it off. I'm gonna be very lonely if, uh, you know, if this happens.Yeah, I do. I do.Uh, Ted. The guy that I fixed you up with.Yeah.Maybe-Maybe I should actually make a greater effort with- with Carol.Well, it's more fun than the Wagner opera.Would you rather be here with Ted ?More enthused ?Well, he's a fun guy. He's a light guy, I'm a heavy guy.You know, Ted-Ted would be fun on a scavenger hunt.You know, he's the guy you want if you have a really heavy scavenger hunt. He's the man.Do you know that this neighborhood was where I first took you out on a date when we-we first started going out.Hey, you remember there was a movie house right on this corner.Not to change the subject.I took you to see \u00abLast year at Marienbad\u00bb on our first date ?Who knew they were flashbacks ? You know.Are you gonna burst into a song, here ? We're in a car.Let me ask you a personal question, here.Did you ever sleep with Ted ?Don't get nervous. Yeah. Yeah, you guys...We were on an eating tour of France, together.You two guys spent an evening, you know, together.At that place, you know.That meant absolutely nothing. She hated me. Julie despised me.You know that. She-She thought I was a low-life and a wimp and a vermin and a roach. Just-Just jump in anytime you want to defend me, you know.Ho-ho ! Hey, you're nailing me... Jesus !...Yeah.I'm... Jesus, I'm sh...That is her. Are you...I told you so.Oh, Jesus. I'm flabbergasted.I know. All the blood rushed to my brother.I don't know what to do.No, I don't want to.No, I'm not afraid.She's an old woman and I'm a virile male.And yet somehow I am scared. I don't know why. Maybe because she's dead. You know ?Well, how ? What do you want to do ?Oh, don't give me Ted ! Wh... Let's... Let's... Wh... Let's get out of here.What ?What ?How ? How ?And came in with a-with a canvas bag, and an umbrella.Mrs. Caine ?Mrs. Caine. Uh-huh.We-We had a present for her. We're friends. We-We wanted to surprise her, because it's her birthday, so-so...Yeah, we-we may need some information, while we're here, so-so, we just want you to know... I'll take very good care of you, if you play ball with us.What are you making that face for ? He's the father of our country.I'm coming, I'm coming.Huh. Very nice. I love a hotel that's got lots of blue powder sprinkled along the baseboard.Mrs. House ?I don't... I don't...I don't think she's...There's nothing here.What's the matter ?Oh, Jesus.What's the matter ?What-What-What...What? What-What's... Carol, still kneeling on the floor, straightens up and looks at Larry.Dead ? T-T-Try-Try giving her the present.Oh, come on ! Let's get out of here !Come on. Let's get out of here.I'm thinking of running the Boston marathon.This woman is forever dying.Come on, come on. Move, move. Adrenaline is leaking out of my ears.Get down those stairs.Come on, come on. Quickly. NEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE THE WALDRON HOTEL - EXTERIOR DAYWhat do you mean, there's nobody up...We just saw her there. She's lying on the floor.She was totally dead.Wait, wait.The... Y-Yes. She was... It looked like she was strangled, or something. Not-Not that I'm an expert on violent death, because I wouldn't know.Right, I'm a... I-I work at Harper's.I'm in publishing.Right, she's a fantastic cook. But, uh, I'm against the restaurant, myself, but-but she's a wonderful cook.Look, obviously what happened is, in the time it took you guys to respond... somebody came here and removed the body. Not that you didn't respond quickly, you know, you were here fast. It took-took you three minutes, not-not-not counting the half-hour that the operator 911 took to understand what I was saying.Any witnesses ?Jesus, I gotta have a drink. I gotta calm myself. I need fourteen Zanacks or something.Ted ? Ted-Ted's, you know, he's got his date with Marcia Fox tonight. He's probably out buying some Spanish Fly.Helen ? I don't know and...I don't want to know about this. I think we should change our lives.We should move out of that stupid apartment, you know. You know, start over maybe in Mexico.You know, sell blankets. We'll work off the hood of a car or something.I'm telling you, I didn't know what's happening. It was like one of those television shows, where you open the door, and you see a-a dead body. You know, I always hated those shows.I... The only one I ever saw was my uncle Morris, who was ninety-four years old.He collapsed from too many lumps in his cereals.This is too exciting. I don't need this. You know, I like something quiet... like a fishing trip, a Father's day, you know, or, the time we saw Bing Crosby walking on 5th avenue. You know, I don't need a murder to enliven my life at all.Make sure and tell me that just before I go to sleep, tonight. That'll be good for me.Great, I'll never get my eyes closed. You know, I mean, what do you want me to do ? I'm petrified. Not only that, but I'm a little drunk.Well, it was... Well... You know, obviously, it wasn't Mr. House, because he has an alibi.She doesn't buy that. She doesn't buy the alibi. Let's get out of here. I want to go home.Jesus, it's starting to rain again. Can you believe that ?Yeah, I know. I know. Ted's got a mind like a steel sieve.You know what I think ? I think it's possible. That hotel room was on the, on the ext... That end of the hall. The camera tilts up the facade of the Waldron Hotel.Yeah, that's eerie, isn't it ?Yeah, well, let's call the police.Check it out ?What, are you nuts ? No, I'm not gonna check that out.Yeah, I know, I know. That's crazy. Look, look. Why don't we go home and nap, and we'll call the police, and they can check it out while we're home in the... ? Carol walks away from the car toward the hotel.What do you mean, it's your case ?Hey, come here. I don't want to do this.No.Hey, don't give me Ted. Ted would be shaking in his boots.I'm at least just trembling like a leaf.My what ?Yeah, I-I...No, no, no, no, no. I-m-I'm-I'm-I'm j... I'm-I'm ju... um... I'm a detective. They-They-They lowered the height requirements, so I... I'll take this card back. They-re, they're......expensive.Be careful.I'm not upsetting anything. I just, you know, I'm just gonna leave a-a set of fingerprints around, so if there's a trial, we can get trapped.I don't like this.Let's go. You know, I've got to get up early tomorrow. I've got to be in temple.Shhh !...I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm... Didn't mea... I-I, oh, it's- It's-It's a...You don't have to turn the bed out. It's not necessary. And no-no-no croissants tomorrow for breakfast.Here, here. Here, take this for yourself. I like the towels. Keep the little mints coming on the pillow, uh...Let's go. That's why the light was on. This is crazy, we're gonna get in trouble.Oh, look. I did damage. I... Now. I'll be sued.That's what ?How do you know ?You did ?Jesus.So much for the police combing every inch of this place. Where did you find it ?Oh, brother. Let's get out of here, come on. And take the ring with you. Maybe there's a pawnshop open.I don't know. I just know, this is very deep stuff.We should not be here. I'm scared, this is creepy. You know what I mean ? This goes... this could be... Who knows who's involved in this ? This could go very deep, Carol. This could be like, you know, like with the Warren commission, or something. I don't like it.Jesus ! What is that ?Why are we stopping ? Why are we stopping ?Don't tell me to relax ! I'm-I'm-I'm a-a world-renowned claustrophobic.Stop. Hit something.I don't like this, I don't, I don't...It's easy for you to say, but I can't breathe, I'm phobic.I'm not panicking, I'm not panicking, I'm...I'm just going to say the rosary, now.Oh, I don't know, I don't like this.Say something. Stop it.I don't like this.I'm running over a field, I see open meadows. I see a stallion.I'm a stallion.There's-There's a cool breeze passing over me.I see grass. I see dirt.You know, you said, you said, \u00abAct as a policeman\u00bb.I said \u00abNo\u00bb. You said \u00abPretend to be a policeman\u00bb. You said \u00abShow him your card\u00bb. I said \u00abWhat card\u00bb.You know, I ca...I can't get through those things.It'll never open, they're painted shut.They're-They're... They-They never, they... they never open.I'm breathing.I can't breathe. I can't breathe.I can't breathe. I can't breathe.I'm fainting because the-there's...Oh, Jesus !Oh, Jesus, you've got to cut down on those rich desserts.Let's go, my life is passing in front of my eyes. The worst part of it is, I'm driving a used car.I'm scared.Oh, my God. It's her.Oh, Jesus. Claustrophobia and a dead body. This is a neurotic's jackpot.We're going down.We're going down.Press up ? I can't see my hand. How can I press up ? Jesus.The basement. I want to get off in the mezzanine. I'm returning shoes. It's dark in here.Where are you... I'm getting back on the elevator. I don't care.I-I can't see anything.Th-Th-These are my matches. I got them at...Look. I got... Yeah, I was with an author. An authoress. At-at the... At...Yeah, b... A French, a French authoress. An author.Jesus.I like a basement with-with knotty pine and a pool table. You know, where you can...What ? What ?I... No, wait a minute. Not so fast. I don't like it here, it's dank. The camera turns around to follow them in the corridor.And there's strange noises. I don't know what this is. I don't know. This...Oh, Jesus !Calm down ? Don't tell me to calm down.This... Wh-Wh... I-I don't... What do you...Oh, relax, relax, relax. Don't... I'll break it down. Stand back.Don't worry. Just-Just give me a second.Must be one of those new doors.Oh, my god. I keep hearing noises.Where ? Where you... Where are you going ? Don't leave me.Well, come on.Come on, get it open.Go into a trot.What ?Jesus.Yes.It is. Oh, brother.I'm not going to follow. I'm not gonna... I don't wanna follow him.I know, I saw that there was a...I don't wanna follow a car with a body in it.It's-It's probably-It's probably a rented car.And a rented body.Come on ! We gotta stop it before it gets dropped.That was Mr. House ! That was definitely Mr. House.I'm gonna call the Police, now.And get them...What are we...Ohhh !...She-She-She gets cremated. She gets killed at the end.Oh, Jesus. What a day, huh ? I can't figure it out. It's got to be that either he's a...Either she's a twin, or he's a twin.Or they're multiple personalities, or you're a twin or I'm a twin.Because I don't know what's going on.You know, look.Let me be logical about this.Hey.Stay calm. I want to try and puzzle this out.Yeah, I'm going to be logical.The, um, the first thing is this.But you-you remember that you heard a noise that night. That had to be Mrs. House leaving to check into the hotel.I can't sleep. I just, I...I'm too, you know... I'm too...Let me, let me call Vincent's restaurant in New Jersey... and why don't we go meet Ted and Marcia and get something to eat, and talk with them.Yeah, so what ? So what ? It's so, you know, Ted-Ted was taking her to a show and to-to-to dinner... so they'll be there.So, hey, kid, this is the apple. This is the town that never sleeps. That's why we don't live in Duluth. That, plus I don't know where Duluth is.Lucky me.Oh, no question about it. It was-It was Mr. House. There was no... Not a, not a question. I mean, you could see him because, uh, you know, there was-there was just no way that you could avoid it. He was right there.Wh... How do you see it ?What do you mean ?That's what I said. That's exac... I used the term \u00abballpark resemblance\u00bb myself.It was my idea. I said what she said.Yeah.That's right, because he introduced her as a colleague.Cheating on two women ?The guy doesn't look the part.She's brilliant. She's brilliant. But the guy... He knows that we know, so if he knows we're on him.She's right, there's no body.Yeah, but it's a great theory. Have you been paying attention ? This is a great theory.I think it's great.Oh, excuse me.Her mind, it just goes.Fantastic.What are you talking about ?I'm, I'm, huh, what's wrong with you ? I'm her editor. I'm- I'm a father figure to her, how...You gotta be joking. What... are you telling me that you're jealous of Marcia ?What'd wrong with you ? You're jealous because he's-he's interested in her.You're kidding. I... We couldn't have gotten her out of that. We... I would have wound up with a few toes and a shoulder, maybe, at most.Yeah, first of all, because I can't, I can't bluff or lie without giggling, so-so...Yeah, but where are you gonna get it. Madame Tussaud's ?Oh, yes. Max Schindler's book. That's right, the phone call.This is perfect.No, no. Because you don't like light reading, so I never...This book. That's fantastic ! It would be so perfect because s-she's a, she's a-an, actress, or would-be actress, anyhow, and you're-you-re... Jeez, we could use his theatre. He's a playwright. This is so perfect. Your theatre is empty all the time, anyhow.Listen to this. What you do is, we get her in for a fake audition, and you write some lines that don't mean anything.And she does them, and she doesn't know what she's doing and we tape-record it.Listen to this.And we edit it up. We edit the tape recording up, and we make one end of a phone call...This is perfect, list...It's coordinated.Actually, in the book what happens is, now that I think of it, he... he kills the... the two people that are working the scheme on him.Um, well, I don't know.Either that, or I've... I've just developed Parkinson's.No, no, no, no, no, I'm not scared. I'm not scared. I'm just turning it over in my mind. I just want to check with my clergyman before we commit.This is Helen Moss.I'm trying, I'm trying.He should be back for lunch, right ?So, everybody's got the right tape recorder and the right tape in ?All right, one second. And then we ca... I mea... so, uh, we're on speaker.Now wait, wait, wait. There's, um... I'm not nervous.We don't have an answer for that. What are we gonna do ?Jesus... we're all screwed up. I got this all screwed up.Somebody press something, come on.You can't press some... Come on. Marcia presses the \u00abmute\u00bb button on the telephone, and Carol presses the \u00abplay\u00bb button on her player.What's the matter ? What are you so angry about ? What are you so... What are you so steamed up about ?What are you talking about ?We had just a big success in there.Marcia likes to read what I like to read.You got stuff in common with Ted, right ? You can cook together with Ted, or you can take your clothes off and baste a chicken with him.Mud wrestling. Is that what you want to hear ? Nothing, I'm her editor.I reevaluated our lives.I... I... I got a ten. You got a six.Oh. You don't have to see your shrink. There's nothing wrong with you that can't be cured with a little Prozac and a polo mallet.What are you talk...Hallo, Mr. House ? This is Larry Lipton. I... I got a... a package I think you're gonna want. Of course it's gonna cost you, uh, $200,000 in... in small, unmarked bills. Or... or... or large marked ones, if... if... if you want to go that route.Oh, really ? Well, I think you're bluffing. Yeah, don't... don't ever try and bluff a bluffer. Yeah, if... if you got Carol, put her on the phone.Oh, my... Oh, my God. D... Don't hurt her !Yes, yes. Yeah, no, no, no, no. I... I... I understand. I, uh, yes, no. I'll be there. I'll be there. I... I... Yes, I'll b... I... I'll bring your wife's body, she... In... in... in the trunk of my car. Yes, I'll... I... I promise. I'll be there. I...I don't have his wife's body. Bluff, bluff.Where's Carol ?I... I got it.No, no, I... I... I got...Why are you so nervous ? What are you so nervous about ?If I don't have her, what are you so nervous ?I got her in the trunk of my car.I... I got her.I... I...No, no, I got her. See, if I don't have her, how come I got her ring ? I got her ring, there. This is... This is her ring.It's a... No, no, no, no. Uh.I could never bluff.I... I... I've lost a fortune in cards over the years.I'm not a bluffer.Carol ? Carol ? Carol ? Medium shot of Gladys and one of her reflections.God ! Are you okay ? Are you okay ?Jesus, I was, I was never so glad to see somebody in my life. Are you all right ?You don't know what's going on out there. I'll never say that life doesn't imitate art again. I'm... I'm... Oh, gee...Yes, and... and... and... a glazier.Quick, quick. Dial, dial, dial.I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, wife mine.Wife mine.What an experience.I'm... I'm still vibrating.Incredible.What do you mean surprisingly ?You seem shocked.You know, I'm a pretty good guy, you know.Where do you wanna go for dinner tonight ? Let's not go to any restaurant where they serve cowards.I... What are you laughing at ?How could you have ever been jealous of Marcia ? Isn't that ridiculous ? Don't you know that I could only love you ?Ted ?You've got to be kidding. Take away his-his-his elevator shoes and his fake suntan and his capped teeth... and what do you have ?Right.

I know.Yeah. Well, with your eyesight, I'm surprised you can see the puck.Yay, hooray.Yeah.know. Can you believe this guy in Indiana ? Killed twelve victims, dismembered them and ate them.Yeah, I'll say.Oh, you do ?Oh, well, I go whenever I have the discipline.Oh god, yeah. I agree with you.Well, geez...Oh, well, we had one. But you know, we got rid of it because it was just taking up too much space.Oh, I know. It's late.Oh, well, yeah.Oh, oh well that'd be fine...Oh, about the tread... oh, well, if I can figure it out, then believe me, anybody can.That's amazing.Let me see.Okay.Brown.Huh ? Do I ?Oh, well, I actually, um, I used to work at an ad agency, but that was many years ago.But... You know, I've been seriously thinking of starting a little restaurant. But, well, Larry, he's trying to talk me out of it.He loves to tease me, but actually, he really loves exotic food.Oh, really ? Oh well, let... listen... I'll fix you a dessert that'll make your eyeballs roll up. You'll have to exercise for a month to work it off.No, really ?Yeah. Oh no. But, you know, they had my initials on them.I was just trying to be neighborly.You know, do you think that's gonna happen to us ?Well, that we'll become like them ? You know, just another dull aging couple, you know, with our little walks, you know...Our TV, our lox and bagels. And... and our twin cemetery plots ?How often do you think they make love ?Larry ?Do you still find me attractive ?No ?Ted.How is Ted ?Oh, really ?God, that movie was great, wasn't it ?I loved it.You know, who could we fix Ted up with ? I mean, there must be somebody in your office.Yeah.Me ?Please. I mean, you know, I adore him, but you know, he's like a girlfriend to me.Do I detect a note of jealousy ?Is there anything we can do ?God, okay.Oh, hallo.Hi, Mr. House, so... sorry.Oh.That's... sure.No, anything. Anything at all. I mean, God, it's just such a shock when anyone... It was just so sudden. I mean, she seemed so... God, well, healthy.She did ? She never mentioned it... It... that she was...No. Right. Well...Yeah, anything. Really.Oh, no, no, no. I know, I haven't forgotten. Believe me, I haven't forgotten.Yeah. Oh, I know. We're going to the opera.Goodnight.Oh, I know, I know. And she did not look like she was ready to go.She never once mentioned that she had a heart condition.Well, she had no problem telling me about her hysterectomy in the first five minutes.No. No ! She wasn't on a diet. We discussed diets.No. Well, I don't know. I mean, you... Are you serious ?Well, it's thanks to you, actually. I mean, it was his idea. The cooking lessons, so I mean...I'm not being cavalier about it.But it's bi... it's what I do. It's-It's what I do, Larry.Oh.Did he seem a little too cheerful ?The restaurant ?No, no, no. No, no, no. I mean, Mr. House, Mr. House. Didn't seem a little too cheerful to you ?Yes. Yes. I mean, there's... Well, you know. I mean, didn't he seem too compose for a man whose wife just died. Don't you think ?Well, I don't know. All I know is, they were supposedly looking forward to their, you know... anniversary, and, and, and, you know, uh-uh, i-i-if... I suddenly dropped dead... wouldn't you sob for months, or-or years, if I... You know...Oh, I don't know.I mean, to me he just seemed a little too perky. You know ?

Uh, was it a large... funeral ?Right. Just a simple affair, uh ? Well, they're the best, aren't they ?I guess. Anyway, then you're laid the rest, and, you know, I was just... where, um, where are the twin cemetery plots ? We... because, we were thinking that that was just such a romantic idea. Weren't we, Larry ? You know ? Larry ? You remember when we were talking about the twin cemetery plots and, you know, how kind of romantic that is ? Remember ?Listen, Larry.Listen.Okay, just... I was in the kitchen okay ? And I was making the coffee. There were no beans, so, I was looking in his cupboards, just to see, you know, and I came across this urn, okay ? And I opened it and there were ashes in it.Larry, he had her cremated !Oh, and who else would it be, okay ?Look, Larry. All I know is he lied, okay ? He lied.Ted !Oh, I know. I know. What about this ? What if they had a big insurance policy, or something like that, huh ?Hu-Huh. Hi. Yeah. Hi, it's me. Listen, we were just in our neighbor's apartment, right ?Yeah. And get this. I came across an urn with ashes in it. Only he says he had his wife buried.Mm. Right. They'd have detected poison, wouldn't they ?Yeah, but why would he... Why would he be lying ? I mean, why-why would he lie at all ?Yeah. Oh, would you do that ? Because... That'd be great. Because, you know, I'm not good at that kind of thing, okay ? All right. Okay. Well, I'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.Hey, I'm not tired.You know, Ted's gonna check with the funeral home, tomorrow.You know what I mean ? I mean, I don't understand why you're not, not more fascinated with this. We could be living next door to a murderer, Larry.Oh my God !Larry. Larry, I heard a noise. I-I-I heard a noise in the hallway, so I just... I... You know, I-I looked and I think... I think Mr. House was getting on the elevator.Yeah, you know, I was... I'm-I'm... almost certain that it was him.Just, you know... I mean, who else could it be ?I know. I know. But wh-who would it be at one-thirty in the morning ?But, you mean, you know how we're always complaining about living on the geriatric floor. Do you know what I'm saying ? A joke ?I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna ring him up. I'm gonna ring his apartment. I'm gonna see if he's home.Yes, because this is really...It's very sus...Let me just... Larry, don't. Wait.That's one ring.Okay, two rings. He's not there, yet.What are you doing ?All right, I'll call. Just keep ringing.Keep ringing.Oh, man.I don't know. What is he doing ? Where is this guy at one- thirty in the morning ? You know what I'm saying ?I don't believe this. Man, I don't get it.No.Just let me think about this a second. Okay, I got it. Wait. I know, it... No, wait. Listen to me. Larry... Listen. He got on the elevator, okay ?No, wait. No, no, listen to this. No.I know. Larry, he got on the elevator and he took it to the basement.He has a car, right ? He's got the garage door key, he opened... he could... he has the...What do you mean, \u00abso what\u00bb ? He's...All right. So, I'm right, though.I mean, I'm right.Yes, he isn't in his apartment.Yeah, that's right.What about your rigidity ? How about that ?How about that point ?Hi !Jack ?Jack, do you think you could come upstairs today, because I got a leak in the kitchen ?You can ?Well, but, it will be this afternoon.All right, you're not gonna go now ?In a minute.Ted... I'm in his apartment.The urn is missing. It's gone. Yeah, I think it might have been. He had this satchel last night. He was carrying this bag, and I think that might have been what he had in his satchel.He's not going snorkeling with his brother. He's got two tickets to Paris, and he's got reservations at the Georges Cinq hotel with a woman named Helen Moss.I'm gonna look around and see what else I can dig up here, okay ? Yeah. I'm telling you, this is just... Ted, I-I'm just dizzy with freedom. This is just... uh, this is just the craziest thing I've ever done.Oh, stop being such a fuddy-dud.Yeah.It was a cinch. I took the key and I just let myself in.Listen. He's not going snorkeling with his brother, okay ? Okay ?He's going to Paris, to a fancy hotel with a woman named Helen Moss.He talked on the phone with a woman.Because he... Well, he came back while I was there, you know, so...Yeah, but I hid under the bed.He didn't see me, Larry. He didn't see me at all.He was-He was very lovey-dovey with his kind of bimbo, you know ? He kept saying stuff like, you know, \u00abdon't worry, it's gonna be all right. We're gonna be together.\u00bb That kind of thing.I know, listen, I-I couldn't think that far ahead.No, I c...Yeah, but... Larry, listen. And then, listen to this. He-He called this woman back. Probably this-this Helen Moss woman, right ?And when he calls her back, she's not there. And then he leaves this message, and he says : \u00abTell her Tom called\u00bb. You know what I'm saying ? Tom. Tom, Larry.Well, okay. Well, I'll tell you. I thought I did...I thought I did a great job, and so did Ted. I don't think a private eye could have done any better than me. I put everything back where I found it, I was very careful. I made one mistake.I left my reading glasses on his table.Oh, hallo. Hi. I-I thought I'd bring you some chocolate mousse. I know how much you enjoyed the last dessert.I thought I'd-I'd give you, you know, another shot at something really delicious. Do you want me to serve that for you, because, you know, you should have it while it's still fresh.That'd be great. That's a great idea.Okay, that'd be really good.Come over here. I put'em... um... right here. Right in here somewhere. The first... Wait. I should... Uh, how-How are you doing in there ? You need...You need any help ?Tea. It's what... I'd like to have some tea.Mine ?Yes.Uh, no. Yeah. Uh... No no no no no. They... They... Oh, God.They are actually... They're mine. Honey, they're mine. I... You know what happened ? I think the other night, I must have left them here. It's the strangest thing.No, no. Yeah. I know. Because, remember, you were saying that you thought that I left them at your mother's house ?That's right. Of course, so...Anyway, it's so good. I love mousse.Hey, listen, are you looking forward to going snorkeling in the Caribbean ?Uh uh.That's because I must have dropped them and they probably got kicked under.They were just...They f...Anyway, I'd love to have some mousse.I remember.I know, but where... where are we going ?Right. So we should just sit here and wait, huh ?Okay.Oh, I don't know. Yeah, maybe we're wrong, Ted. Maybe we're just, you know... I mean, maybe she died of natural causes, like the doctor said and we're just two people with, you know, hyperactive imaginations whose lives need a little shot of adrenaline.Yeah? What's that, there ?Okay.It's not her ?Oh, God, you really have this worked out, don't you ?Maybe she doesn't work. Maybe she's like... you and she has writers hours.Oh, God. Oh, dear. What ?Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah.Right. Do you remember those wonderful cottages ?And I remember... that we shared a bedroom together, right ?No. Well, I knew what was going on in your mind... because of the way you kept plying me with Chateau Margaux, remember ?Well, you... Yeah, God. It seems like a long time ago, doesn't it ?Oh, what ?Okay. Uh, it looks like he's gone. Yeah. Yeah. He's gone.Listen, Larry. I want to take another look around his apartment. Yeah.Listen.He'll never be back, Larry.No, he's not coming back. Not for at least an hour, an hour and a half.Yeah.No, wait a minute, look, he was with this young model type, and they were talking about money.So, that's the motive.What are you talking about ?Come here. What do you mean, Larry ?What do you mean ?What do you m...Huh ? Larry, I went for two years.Just come... come on.Larry, we'll be in and out in five minutes.Five. Only five.Well, I didn't...No, I...Larry, all I can tell you is, if this had been a few years ago, you would have been doing the same thing. Because if you recall, we solved a mystery. Yep, we solved a mystery once. Remember ? It was the-it was the noises in the attic mystery.That's right. So...This... Wh... You agree, right ? It's murder, Larry ? So, I'm right. She opens the front door and walks out of the apartment.Oh, damn it.Please, stop it, will you ? Please, be quiet, Larry.Be quiet. You're gonna wake up the neighbors, okay ? Okay, I got it. I got it.Listen, Larry... Relax, okay ?Oh, don't worry about it. All right, now Ted told me to try something here... Yeah. She rests her hands on the telephone, which is next to the lamp.Um, \u00abLast number dialed\u00bb.Just be quiet for a second, all right ?Shhh !Larry.Uh, who ? MALE VOICE OVER FROM THE PHONE Who is this ? Who do you want ?Um, who's this ?Do you know anybody named Waldron ? Waldron ?Just be quiet. Okay, wait.Oh, great. Now they-they hung up on us.Oh, great.No, just let me think for a second, now. Waldron, right ? Helen Moss. Okay. He used the name Tom, right ? So, Tom Waldron. We gotta run a check on that.Come on.Right.Oh, oh, wait. Look.What do you mean ?What are you do... Well, just... Clean it up, Larry. Clean it up.Put it under the rug, or something like that, okay ?Well then glue it. Glue it back to...Oh, look. Look.Look.So ? I know. I know, but you keep yours out on the bureau in this kind of weather ? Uh ?I think something's very strange, here. I mean, he left these out and ready. I think the whole thing is really sinister.What ?So, how did you like your birthday cake, Nick ?I know.I know.I know. What-What-What are you laughing about ?Well, what about that ?Oh.Really.You're going to get something from Brooks Brothers ?Well, if I'm going to be a restaurant owner, I should know something about wines. Don't you... Larry ?What ?Honey, I'm here. I'm right o...Carol. Remember me ?Oh, hi.Oh, you did.Well, very nice. That's lovely.Okay, you too.Goodbye.So, that's Marcia Fox, huh ?Well, do you think she's Ted's type ? Is that...Yeah.Thank you.You know, your pupils are dilating.I just wanted to tell you that.I see.What do you mean ? Nick.So, Larry fixed you up with Marcia Fox, huh ? His, uh...His favorite writer.Oh.Sure.So, you're taking her to Vincent's out in Jersey ?Is that what you're...No ? God, look at this! Oh, that park is so beautiful.No ?You're getting... So am I. I don't know about this.You've got to go, huh ?Okay.Me, huh ?Well. Oh, boy.Thanks. No, I-I think I'll stick around, I need to think. I need my... I feel a little, you know, tipsy.No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You didn't offend me, no, I was very, uh, flattered by this, Ted. Flattered. Well, anyway.See you. Oops, careful. Whoops.Excuse me.Larry.I just saw Mrs. House. LARRY What are you talking about ? The ashes ?No, no, no. A bus. It passed me, and she was on it.No, but I'm not, I'm not joking. I mean, I'm telling you something. I'm telling you, I really saw her. I actually saw her.Yeah.No, Larry, you know, I was at the wine-tasting, right ? And I was just... I was sitting at, you know, a bay window. I-I happened to look out. A bus passed, and she was on it, Larry.I...But ?Yeah...I know. I know. Okay. I-I... Yeah. I had a few drinks, but it's-it's not... I mean, I saw her.I ...Okay. Are you telling me that you... That, that, that, that you... That I didn't see her ? Is that what you're saying ?I just... I just don't know what's happening, Larry. I-I-I don't know what's going on.What's... yeah.I...Why ?Honey, you're getting so close-minded these days. I just...Oh. Oh, God.Hallo ? Ted. Ted.Ted, you're not going to believe this, but, Ted, I saw Mrs. House. Yes, Mrs. House. Yeah. Mrs... the murdered woman. That's right.Yeah. No, I'm sure. I'm sure I saw her. She was on a bus, you know ? I mean, I-I saw her just moments after you left. I was looking out the... Larry puts the cork back on the bottle.Would you ?Would you really ? Oh, that would be so great. You'd just run a check on Paul and Lillian House.What are you talking...What are you doing ? I mean...Larry, what are you... But, what ?I'm telling you, I saw Mrs. House.I s...Okay.Now look. Just... I can tell you. I can show you the exact spot, Larry.Uh ? What about lunch ? Tomorrow ?On... on your, on your lunch hour ?Oh, God. I'm telling you... I mean, this is such a shock.I mean, I'm telling you, I'm just vibrating from this. I mean, I saw this woman.What ? Wh...I'm not going to the theatre.Do you comprehend the enormity of what I'm telling you, Larry ? Do you compr...What am I going to say to them ?What story ? I don't have a story. I mean, I got nothing. Unless... Oh !Unless... Unless I locate her.Right. Yeah. You saw her lying there, right ?You said... Yeah, but... but you're, you-re sure it was her, right ?Okay, look. Yeah, yeah.The super is a drunk. I know, but, we've seen him smelling of Jack Daniel's, remember ?I mean, I know he didn't see Mrs. House, Larry.Well, I don't know. Oh, I know. Unless he's in on it.Shh !... Shh !...I mean, she...Well, she's alive. And my question is, who was in that bag. I mean, somebody...Look, somebody... Somebody got cremated, Larry. Somebody.Right.Right, I know.So goes Larry's theory.Right here. This is it.And I was having a glass of, you kn-you know, wine, and I looked out the window, and-and I saw the... right here.Yes, I saw... her on a bus. It was passing. You... It was, like.I'm positive I-I saw her.Whoo !... Excuse me. I-I'm telling you, Ted.Uh, I don't know what the number of the bus was, but I know that it was heading west to east, so it was... it obviously was a cross-town bus.Right.So, okay. So, then, it's like...Then... Her destination was probably within the next five or six blocks.Don't, don't doubt me, okay ?I'm-I'm not kidding. Look.Oh, God. Well, I think, you know, I think we've reached the end of the line.Look. The bus.Yeah, what ? Oh. Whoo !...Yeah, I know.Well, what do you think ?Do you think we should retrace our steps ? NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAYNo, I don't think it looks good, and I don't even know if it looks... I mean, I feel like it'd be to masculine if I wore it with a pair of pants.Oh.Ted, look.Well ?Wh-What about...Great. Oh, God. It looks like it's gonna rain again. Well ?So, you bored ? I mean...Yeah. Well, to me, I mean, just... I mean, it's just one of the most exciting adventures I've ever been on.Well-Well, he has a more enthused attitude, Larry. I...Yeah, enthused, yeah.Well, I...No, look. I... Larry, you used to be a lot of fun.I know, well, but, y-you know. You used to...What ? I don't know. I don't know. Just for some reason, you've gotten so stodgy in your old age, you know ?No, I know. Yes ! Yeah, I remember.You know, I...Yeah, I know. I had to explain it to you for the next six months.Look, Larry. Look. We've got plenty of time to be conservative. You know what I'm saying ? Don't you see ?It's to me, it's like this-this tantalizing plum has just, like dropped into our laps. I mean, life is just such a dull routine and here we are, right ? I mean, we're on the threshold of a genuine mystery. I mean, to me, the whole thing is like. It's... Hey, no. The camera stops moving on another medium shot, where we still see Larry through his open window, but we see Carol only through the wet windshield.Just don't make fun of me, okay ? Because I'm open to new experiences.Yeah.Sleep ?What, are you nuts ?Yeah.Yeah, right. We sp...I know... Yeah, but what about you ? Remember ? You spent the evening with Julie. Am I right ? You spent the night, and shared a...What ?Hey, I mean, I'm waiting for you to say something I don't agree with, okay ?Oh. Larry.I know. W-Well. Come on.Yeah. I know.What do you mean, you told me so ? What are you talking about ? You're nuts, honey.Yeah. No, look. You're white. You're completely white.Larry !Let's go. Let's get out there. Let's find out what's going on.Oh, come on. Y-You're not afraid of her, are you ?You're not afraid of Mrs. House.I know.Let's go. You know, I tell you, I'm gonna break this thing wide open.I'm... You know, I'm... God, if only Ted were here with us now. You know what I'm saying ?No, wait. I got an idea.I know what we should do. We should get a gift, right ?We'll surprise her. We'll sneak into the hotel. Come on.Yeah, no. Come on.Uh, excuse me. Hi.Um, we were just wondering. Uh, did you see a woman come in ? She was, uh, she was a little woman, about five foot three ? She had on a gray sweater ?Slightly older. Not...Mrs. Caine. Oh, yes. Uh-huh. That's her.Yes.Yes, that's right. What room ?Six-eleven. Really, thanks a lot.Come on. What're you doing ?Okay. Um, six-eleven. Six-oh-seven.Six-eleven. Here, Larry. All right.Um, Mrs. House ?Hallo ? Mrs. Hou...My God, I don't...Ahhh ! Larry !Oh, my God ! Wait a minute !Oh, my God, look ! Mrs. House ? Mrs. House ?Hallo ?Mrs...Oh, Larry.I think she's dead.Yeah. Oh, my God. Mrs. House ? Mrs. House ?I think that's it, Larry. I think she's dead !Oh, my God.Oh, God. Okay, oh God.Okay, all right.There's what ?Wait a minute, wait...We-We saw...We...We... She's there.Because, I mean, she was, she was there, do you understand ?We're-We're two professional people.Yeah.Yeah, that's right, and I'm-I'm looking to start a little restaurant, basically French, although international cuisine would be fine. Not that I really have a location...Okay, just...All right.Uh, did you check...Yeah, b...Yeah, but you didn't use our names, or anything like that, did you ?No, okay.No, I'm... No, I mean, he's in some sort of scheme, here. It's...It's not... Oh !All right.Thank you. Thanks very much.Thanks very much. Oh, man, I don't know how we're gonna...Where is Ted ? I just don't understand where Ted is. I mean, you know, all this stuff is happening.Do you think Helen Moss might be in on this ?I think so.No, think about it.No, no, no.I'm just beginning to calm down.Yeah. You know, I've never seen a dead person before in my whole life.Yeah.Larry, is this the most exciting thing that's ever happened to us in our whole marriage ?You know, whoever did it was probably still in the room while we were there. Probably hiding in the closet.But you know, that probably means he saw us.I wonder who was cremated. Who was it ?Well, yeah, but I don't buy that.Oh, God. If only Ted were with us, he'd have a million theories about this, I'll tell you that.Oh, right.Larry, the lights !My God. This gave me the chills, honey.I mean... Oh, no, no, no. Come on. Let's go over there now. Let's check it out. Come on. We don't have time.Yes.No, but look at it, Larry. Look at that. There's lights going on, there.Oh, no, the police are red tape. Come on. This is my case, honey.Yes, it's my case.No, come on.Oh, God. If only Ted were with us.Ted... Oh, God.Um, excuse me. We're with the Police department. We'd like to, uh, check out room, uh, six-eleven, please ?Uh, that's right. Yes. Mm-hm. Yeah.Ee... Ooh, um, just, uh-uh... Show him your card.Your-Your card. Your-Your Police identification card.Your card, you know. Your card. He's got his card.Yeah. See ?Thank you very much. Six-eleven ? Okay. Great.Come on.Okay.Telling me to be careful. Now, just don't upset anything. Okay, Larry ?All right, now look. The murderer must have, like, hid in this closet, right ?Right, and then he must have...Okay, he must have dragged the b... The body out, really fast. What ?Oh, hi.Oh, Jesus. Larry. I mean, really.Just a second, Larry. Let me just look around here, just a little bit.Larry, look. Look. I thinks that's her wedding band, Larry.How do I know ? I saw it on her.Yeah.I think so.I found it behind the door, right there.Okay. Okay.Didn't I tell you the police weren't thorough ? I mean they probably thought we were cranks, right ? I mean, we got no body, and... I mean, they must get fifty crisis calls a minute. Why would they bother with us ?Just...Oh, not the Warren Commission.Oh, my God !Wait a minute. Okay, all right, now look. All right. The- the elevator's probably stuck.Relax now, Larry.It's okay. It's okay, everything's going to be fine.I am hitting it.I know, I know. It's okay.The-the idea is, there's plenty of air, in this elevator. Uh, Larry, relax. Now, if you just don't panic, okay ? Don't panic, all right ?Now, just don't worry.Somebody'll help us. Somebody's gonna help us. Somebody'll find us here. Hello !Hello !Hallo ! Hallo !Oh, God, look just...Yes, it's...Shh. Shut up, Larry.Larry, just shut up and calm down. Just, okay ? You're gonna be o...Larry, shut up ! Hallo ! Hallo !I know, yeah.Okay, wait a minute. I know what. Here, just... Larry, boost me up.Boost me up, and we'll get out there. We're gonna do it.Yeah. Yes we can. I can do it. I can loosen it.No, wait. No, Larry.Come on. All right, put your hand together. Come on. Put your hand together.No, no, it's okay.Larry !Larry, I mean, it's just... All I have to do is loosen that, okay.All right, put your hand together. Put you hand together. Now give me a boost, okay ?All right, you ready ?Wait a second ! Wait, wait !Oh, wait a minute, now ! Oh, just wait ! Wait, wait !Okay, now you'd think they'd loosen this stupid thing.Oh, my God !So that's where he hid her.Oh ! Oh, Larry, hold on. I'm scared.Oh, God. What's happening ?Oh, God, press up ! Press up !We must be heading for the basement, Larry.What ? What are you doing ?I don't know where... Larry.There's nothing out there. Wait a minute. What are you doing ? Larry lights a match, and we see his scared face lit by the flame of the match.Hey, what are you doing with matches ?Wait a minute, what... When were you at the \u00abCaf\u00e9 des Artistes\u00bb ?At the \u00abCaf\u00e9 des Artistes\u00bb ?Wait. Shh ! Shh ! Shh !Try this way.Hey, look, look, look, look. Uh-huh.What's this ?All right.Calm down.There. Turn the light on. Larry switches the light on. They are in a room with beige walls. There are pots of paint stacked behind Larry.Let me see.Where... There. Oh. We're locked in here. What are you gonna do ?Careful, now.Don't hurt yourself.Let's try out here.Oh. What's down there ?Let me see. It's okay. What ? Oh !Yeah. I think this is it. I think this is the service entrance.I'm trying.I got it. I got it.Wait ! Wait ! Did you see that ?It looks like somebody's putting a body into a car.I swear. Look. It's got a white sheet on it.Right... Yeah. Come on.No, let's follow it. I swear, there was a body in that car.Larry !Come on, hurry up. Hurry up !There ! Oh !Hurry up. Come on.Look, look !Oh, my God.What are we gonna do ?Oh, Larry, and tell them what ?I mean, this guy...You know, he's got proof his wife died of a heart attack two weeks ago. We've got no body. We've got nothing, Larry.What ? What ? What's wrong ? What? Oh !...Oh, my God. Oh, my God.Hey.H-How are you ?Mrs. D... How are you ? Nice to see you.Yes.Yeah, it is. We, you know...Yeah.Love to.See you later.Oh, well, it...What a shame.Good night.What ?He... He...You're nuts.Wait, wait, yeah.Okay, she's not a twin. We know she's not a twin.What are you talking about, Larry ?I'm calm, Larry. Okay, but okay, she's a twin, she's not a twin. I mean, now you're saying we are twins ? What are you, nuts? Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm, okay.All right, all right.Yeah. Yeah. Well...No, wait a minute, wait.But it doesn't make any sense at all, Larry, because suddenly, you know, he murders her. I mean, what's it all about ?Wait a minute. At one in the morning ? What are you talking about ? You mean... You wanna...All the way out to New Jersey...Yes. Oh, yes, I'm here to tell you...I know. You used the term, right.Yeah, well, we got that far, with the exception of the actual spontaneous heart attack.Okay, but what about Mrs. Dalton ? He claims he took her to the movies.Well, j...Hold on, hold on, for a second. We don't know this is all true. This is just a theory.I am paying attention.I'm surprised you two didn't drool yourself to death.Why? Uh-huh. Yeah. Him.Yeah, uh-huh. What about you ? You were gonna jump into her lap. I saw you, Larry.Huh ?Yeah, the only thing you didn't do is rub your hands together. That was it.I... Well. It's not that I'm jealous.Yeah, look who's talking. My God, I mean, you kept staring into her eyes like she was the Dragon Lady, or something.Well, I'd just like to know if you take all your-your authors to lunch at the Caf\u00e9 des... Marcia walks back to the table.Okay, okay, just...Let me tell you why he's not going to believe us, okay ?Yeah. No, because if we really had the body, why tell him ? Why not go straight to the Police ?Yeah, you know, wait. There's just so many fallacies in this, I can't even count them.Like who ?Since when did I not like light reading, Larry ?Oh, God.What's he gonna say ?In the book. You mean, you're basing your plan on some dumb paperback ?I s... No, really.Oh.No, no.I... I just...Yeah. Yeah, wait. I... So, what you're saying is...Wait, no, okay... What you're saying... Oh boy. You're saying, you want to provoke Mr. House into trying to murder Larry and me.Well, yeah, it's, excuse me, hey, don't worry, yeah, okay.This is so insane.Oh, w...Mm...mmm... What thought ? Wait.What ?I have to go home and change.I've got an appointment with a friend of Ted's about a location for... What ?What do you mean ? Well, I meant... I just don't understand how you could give a book to Marcia, and not to me.I just don't need...What...Oh, right, God. Yeah, well it's true. I guess it's true. I mean, we've got nothing in common, that's for sure. Now that, now that Nick's grown up, I mean, you know, we're just left facing each other.Oh, right. Oh, oh, well, what about you and Marcia, huh ? What does she teach you besides poker ? That's what I'd like to know, okay ?Look, I think the time has come for us to reevaluate our lives.Yeah.Well, listen, I think maybe I will go back to seeing my shrink.Just... I just would like to be alone for a while, okay, Larry ?Just... just, I... I... Uh, okay ?Larry, Larry, help me ! I'm here, Larry !Oh, God, Larry ! Oh, Larry, I'm so happy to see you !Yes, I'm all right.We... we gotta call the police, Larry.I know. Oh, God.Larry. Oh, God, Larry. Oh, God. Oh, honey. Oh, God. Ow ! Ow ! Oh, God ! Jesus !Aow ! Aow !
