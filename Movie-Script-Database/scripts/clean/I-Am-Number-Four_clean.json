OFF Daniel's panicked nod...Taillights in five minutes. What we can't carry --Time to go.Florida's clear. I sent a letter to the school and there's nothing in the papers.New IDs. Daniel pulls out his birth certificate, reads the name.I'm not interested in originality. I'm interested in untraceable. There are 335,321 John Smiths in the United States. John looks at him, then abruptly gets up and storms away. Henri drops $20 on the table and calmly heads after him.You got lulled into a false sense of security. That's my fault. John struggles to keep his temper in check.I wish that you could have a normal life -- but you can't. Only now does John turn and face him. His eyes blaze with frustration.That's exactly what Number 3 did.It's from an African news site. A man and his son went missing two nights ago. The locals think they were taken by strange beasts. John understands the implication.The Mogadorians are natural-born hunters. Blending in is our best protection.Until I say otherwise -- yes. John waits as a TRUCKER passes through the room. His voice softens but never loses its intensity.You are.Like it or not, it's your home too. You have a responsibility to those who died.Cheer up, you're going to be living in Paradise.What's your name?Where are you from, John?Why did you move to Paradise?This was a lot easier when you wereIt's perfect. Annie places the fruit basket on the dining table and begins turning on the lights.Don't you worry about it. She nods, grateful.I need a new photo first. John crosses and stands against the wall.Say Paradise. John gives him a withering look. Henri flashes off a shot. The camera is cabled to one of the laptops. TIGHT ON LAPTOP: The image of John pixelates onto a digital grid and a face-recognition program begins to map his facial structure. Henri turns to another laptop.I've imputed the new search words: Daniel Jones. Big Pine Key. Sunset High School. You think of any others?If there's a story or picture of you on the internet, this program will find it. Our enemy doesn't know who you are -- I want to keep it that way. John nods, knows he's being a jerk.I found our intruder -- he's a little small for a Mogadorian. At that moment,Must have been dumped.What are you going to call him?This one has five days of rations, spare clothes, cash and a handheld GPS. Keep it with you at all times.Game's changed. You're in the crosshairs now. You have to be ready to leave at a moment's notice. With or without me. John stares at the backpack, takes in this new reality. He pushes the plate away, snatches the backpack and heads out the door. Henri stares at the omelette, tastes a pinch of hash browns, then puts the plate on the floor on his way out. It takes Bernie 2.5 seconds to race over and start to eat.Let's keep this our little secret. OFF Bernie's inquisitive eyes...Calm down. You're going to be okay. John angrily holds up one of his luminescent hands.Yours.Your first Legacy is starting to manifest.An extraordinary ability. Yours is called Lumen. They start a lot sooner on Lorien. I was beginning to fear yours would never emerge.I didn't want to worry you. You were already under enough pressure.This couldn't be opened until your first Legacy appeared. Ready? John nods nervously. Henri places the fingertips of his right hand onto five petal-shaped discs inlaid onto the lid. John cautiously follows suit and places his fingers on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpetals\u00e2\u0080\u009d fanned across the opposite side.Open it. John nods, cautiously lifts the lid, revealing a neat assortment of velvet pouches and an array of colored rocks. They range in size and color but all share a serene beauty.Crystals from Lorien's core. They'll guide us in your training. John tries to reach for one, but Henri slaps his hand away.Place your hand over them. John follows the instruction and is amazed when a walnut- sized crystal floats up from the Box. It slowly begins to spin and projectOur solar system. Henri points to a planet. Its oceans are dark with pollution and its sprawling continents are barren and treeless.That's what Lorien looked like thousands of years ago. We had all the problems that Earth has today. The planet was dying until our people made a collective decision to change and slowly Lorien began to heal itself -- that's when the Legacies started. John watches as the spinning planet transforms before his eyes. Its oceans turn a vibrant chroma-key blue and the land masses become a lush emerald green.Only a select few developed these abilities. They became known as the Garde.Like your parents and grandparents. John considers this new information.They're Garde as well. Once you've mastered your Legacies, we'll find them and face the Mogadorians together. John looks at Henri, curious.I don't have any and never will. I'm your Cepan -- a teacher. My job is not just to protect you but to train you.Trust me. Henri flicks a flame to life and sweeps it under John's outstretched palm.You feel that? Amazingly, the flame harmlessly licks the skin. But when Henri moves the lighter further up John's arm --When we're done, your entire body will be shielded against fire. John rubs his singed wrist.You'll get other Legacies too.You don't get to pick them off a menu. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. As John spins to the door, the shimmering galaxy fades and the crystal drops to the floor.Mogs don't knock.It's a girl. John looks over his shoulder and reacts with surprise.Everything okay?I think you should stay home from school for a couple of days.Just to be safe.Wasn't that your friend from the other night?Principal called. Said there was an incident.You're stronger and faster because of Earth's gravity -- you shouldn't use that advantage to settle petty scores.You can't risk everything over wounded pride.Article says it was arson.They can track us anywhere. I think it's time you saw what you're really up against.Your life is my life now. I will always protect you.A lot of Lorics sacrificed their lives so that you could live.The Elders had a plan. You weren't on that ship by chance. The nine of you were chosen for a reason. Even if only two of you live, together you'll pose a grave threat to our enemy. Consumed by bitterness, John hurls another stone.I never thought we'd get off Lorien alive -- but we did. I didn't know how we could survive on a strange planet -- but we have. I gave us six months before the Mogs found us -- it's been 10 years. Don't give up now. Henri grips John's shoulders.You have the potential to do great things. Even if you don't see it -- I do.Because your life is my life. If you quit, then everything I've worked for and sacrificed is meaningless.No... go. John looks at him, surprised by this paternal gesture.You've had enough for one day.I heard on the police scanner that eight boys were beaten up in the woods tonight. Henri turns on a light, nursing a mug of coffee. Bernie wakes. John pulls off his hood. Henri looks at the cuts and bruises on John's face.That was a stupid thing to do. What were you thinking?Telekinesis. That's a big step. Must have been triggered by the fight. John doesn't correct him, averts his gaze.I need to teach you how to control these abilities. We'll start working on that tomorrow. The conversation is suddenly interrupted by the repetitive WHINE OF AN ALARM. They cross to the bank of computers. Henri urgently stabs commands into a keyboard.We got a hit on one of the search words.Looks like a cell phone camera. There's enough for the Mogs to ID your face.Working on it.This isn't your fault. There's still nothing to trace us here. Henri glances up from his screen.This could take all night. Get some sleep.I wasn't the only who was up last night. John nervously hands Henri one of the cups and lies...I've tried every trick I know, but I can't crack that blog's firewall.We need to find where the site's located and take it offline manually. The URL source has been run through a labyrinth of servers, it could take weeks to track down.You can. Get changed.I've found the -- Caught in the act, the teens lurch away from each other.You're clearly putting a lot of effort into it.I finally tracked the location of that blog. It's a house in Warsaw, Indiana. About four hours from here. I'm heading up there tomorrow.Send my regrets.I won't risk taking you. I'll leave early and be back by five. John looks up and sees Henri sitting in solitude.How could I? I have you.We aren't like humans. Once we fall in love, it's for life. The pain of separation is unbearable. Henri's face clouds with melancholy and he abruptly gets up. As he heads into the kitchen John studies him with new eyes.Anastasia.You're not responsible for what happened to her -- they are. He slowly turns and regards John with deep paternal concern.I looked at her the way you look at Sarah.I was hoping to protect you from that pain.You shouldn't be here.I talked my way in. Thought the big guy was buying it. He rubs a wound on his neck.I was asking him about the video when the other one shot me from behind... some sort of animal tranq.The Mogadorians... they've been here? Frank nods in terror.We need to go! Now! John \u00e2\u0080\u009creleases\u00e2\u0080\u009d Frank, who drops onto the floor like a whale and is knocked out. At that moment, a razor-thin line of dust drops from the floorboards above.Start the engine.Yes, you can. John nods, puts his hand on the dash and closes his eyes. The engine TURNS OVER but doesn't start. Sam looks up the street, panicked, asWe're not going back to Paradise.We leave at nightfall.It's only a matter of time. They know our faces. They saw Sam. How long has he known?I trusted you and you lied to me! John bows his head, can't meet Henri's gaze.Now we don't have a choice. The Mogs are using humans to trap us. From this point on -- no more towns. No more schools. We're going off the grid until we find the others.This isn't a discussion. In a flash of pent-up anger, John holds up his hand and telekinetically sweeps Henri off his feet and pins him against the wall. Henri looks at him, stunned.Let. Me. Down. Spent, John releases Henri who slides to the floor, shaken. The dynamics of their relationship forever changed. Henri finally stands.Give me your phone and IDs. John hands him his cell phone and wallet. Henri opens the back of the phone and pulls out the SIM card. SNAP!John Smith dies today.John? No answer. He KNOCKS. Still nothing.John's not at the house. Is he here?I know. He turns back to his SUV. Sam follows.Go back inside. This isn't your fight.Get out now! At that moment, all the POWER in the school DIES and the headlights of an SUV flash across the window. Fear registers in John's eyes as he realizes...I see age hasn't mellowed your attitude, 6. Mark turns to John, guilt-wracked.He's telling us to run! They take off a second beforeBernie's a Chimera. He came with us from Lorien.Somebody had to watch you when I wasn't around. They exit while Bernie and the Piken continue to battle.Right behind us. He offers her his hand. She's about to take it whenYou know how to use one of these?nobly shoves John out of the way and is plucked into the Piken's jaws. The creature shakes him like a rag doll and flings him 50 feet down the field. John watches, anguished, as Henri lands in a heap.I won't be coming with you this time. Save yourself.Find the others. His voice is a GRAVELLED WHISPER.Your life is my life... always. His eyes flutter closed and he slips from John's grip. Anguished, John doesn't notice his pendant momentarily flicker with a radiant blue light.

the last scar.I liked Florida. I liked having friends. I liked feeling normal. Henri's face softens with paternal compassion.Then why fake it? Why not just go hole up in the wilderness.Piken.So we just keep moving from town to town?I want to be from someplace, Henri.Lorien's your home, I don't even remember it. John's tone rubs Henri the wrong way.I want a say in where we live. You already picked it, didn't you?She looks even perkier than the realtor in Florida. A warm smile graces her round face and she's clutching a fruit basket. For the record, she is called ANNIE.John Smith.Arizona.Because you're an asshole. John waits for a reaction but doesn't get one...Because my dad needs peace and quiet to research his book. Henri nods and smiles wryly.That's one word for it. Stewing, John exits into the hall with his duffel bag. Annie reads the strained dynamic.This guy was covering a hole in my wall. Annie's cheeks blush with annoyance.That's the last of them. I'm hitting the sack.Yeah, this place sucks.Sand Dollar Beach, that's where we were jet skiing. Henri types it in when something SCRATCHES at the door. Their heads instantly turn towards the sound. Tense SILENCE. SLOW PUSH IN ON THE DOOR as another SCRATCH echoes. Henri is on his feet. He flicks off the lights and silently signals John to retreat down the hall. With the cool air of an assassin, Henri unzips a duffel bag and pulls out a sleek crystal-handled dagger. As he steps to the door...He's starving, doesn't have any collar or tags.You know, another pair of eyes and ears watching the house wouldn't be a bad thing. Henri considers the request, nods. John playfully ruffles the dog's head.Since I need all the luck I can get -- how about Bernie Kosar?Wow. You outdid yourself. What's up? Henri lifts a red backpack into view. John stares at it.I already have a backpack.Henri, come on.Bernie, what the hell... were you hiding in the car? He scoops the dog into his arms.He's not supposed to be here.Sorry about your shot.Someplace warmer.I need to register. She raises her camera to snap a shot of him.Whoa. What are you doing?Please don't point that at me.What's your problem? I said no.I'm not big into having my picture taken. Sorry. As he heads away, Sarah watches, intrigued. CAMERA TRACKS TO REVEAL MARK JAYNE monitoring the encounter. He's the star quarterback and his chiselled jaw tenses with jealousy.Didn't know I was on it.She was talking to me.Maybe I'll fire back next time.You sound like my dad.Thanks for the download. As he SLAMS his locker shut...It was an accident.Fine. At that moment, Mark Jayne and his buddy, KEVIN, cut in front of them. Annoyed, John taps Mark on the shoulder.Line starts back there.Where's that posted?In that case, I guess I better ask you where I should sit. I was thinking about grabbing that chair next to your girlfriend. In a flash of anger, Mark whips up his tray, hammers it into John's chest, knocking him to the floor.Henri, what's happening to me?On what planet is this okay?Okay, start talking. What the hell's going on?Legacy?You knew this was going to happen? Why didn't you say anything?What else have you been hiding from me?Whoa. PUSH IN ON Bernie as he sits up and watches the Box unfold. Like an intricate jigsaw, the sections finally regroup, creating a new pattern on the lid. It's a familiar geometric symbol. John touches the crystal pendant that hangs from his neck -- the symbols are an exact match.What are they?That's what I am?The other children in the ship... Henri finishes John's thought.What Legacy do you have?Ouch. John jerks his hand away. Henri kills the flame, shrugs.Flying would be cool.Do what?I don't know what you're talking about.No.I don't know what happened. Maybe it's a sign that you should invest in a digital camera.She was returning my backpack. He dumps it by the door.I'm fine.I'm going for a run. Bernie trots out and wags his tail pleadingly.Sorry, buddy, you couldn't keep up.Wanted to apologize.John. TIGHT ON THEIR HANDS as they shake. She checks out his fingerless gloves, amused.You know all these people? She nods.Not very interesting.You first.Your secret's safe with me. She studies him, sensing a kindred spirit.Every single day.I'm going to take off. Mark doesn't take his eyes off John and blocks his way.Wasn't feeling well. They twist their combination locks. Sam swings open his door, there's a HISSING POP andhas his door halfway open and ducks back a second before the ink pack planted in his locker ERUPTS. The spray misses his face but violently spits across his chest and arms. LAUGHTER echoes behind them. John spins and finds Mark and his posse. TIGHT ON John's hands as he balls them and an angry glow flickers through his gloves.That sensation you're feeling -- remember it. With a quick push, John shoves Mark back against the lockers. Mark DENTS a door and slides to the floor, his eyes flaring with lacerated pride.Show's over. The crowd disperses. Mark gets to his feet and exits with his friends, but shoots John one final wounded glare...Who's in the picture? Sam stares at it, nostalgic.I'll live. He starts off again.Why are you telling me? She bows her head, suddenly embarrassed.You made the right call. The certainty of his voice soothes her. She looks up and holds his gaze. Their attraction is undeniable.I saw the banners.Her name's Sarah.A guy was messing with me. I took care of it. Problem solved.It was no big deal. Don't blow it out of proportion.I wasn't looking for a fight. It just happened. Get off my back. Henri pulls a printout from his coat. John unfolds it. ANGLE ON PRINTOUT: It's from the Florida Keynoter website and features a photo of the charred stilt house. John's gut churns as he stares at the image.We were clean. There's no way the Mogs can track us here. Henri shakes his head, shifts into gear and starts off.Nooooooooooo! He drops the crystal and stumbles back. The experience has left him traumatized. Henri steps towards him, but John is too overwhelmed and runs out.I saw my grandfather. I saw what you did to the Mogadorians -- you saved my life.He said I must survive.You saw what they did to Lorien. How can nine or six or two of us take on that army? It's hopeless. Henri knows he has to pull him out of this mournful funk.How can you put so much faith in me?It's Sarah. The Block Party's tonight. I'll say I can't make it. Henri sees John is wracked with doubt and confusion.You work here?What about your stepdad?They should pull out all the stops next year.Definitely unique.I'm glad you broke free.I'm trembling on the inside. He smiles.What was that?Are you sure? As he steps forward,Sarah! Sa- His voice is cut off as a fist SMASHES into his jaw and the steel cap of a combat boot SLAMS his groin. John staggers up but is viciously kicked back to the ground. PUSH IN ON JOHN'S FACE as it hardens with blind rage. In a blur of motion he reaches up, grabs two of his attackers by their coats and hammers their skulls together. As they drop, John spins to meet his other two foes withWhere's Sarah? Tell me!!Back off! Mark watches John step out. Blood trickles from a cut above John's right eye.They got spooked.I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at myself. She stops, faces him.The guy's in love with you. Wants you back.For this? Wouldn't waste their time. She looks at him, curious.You can. The air is charged.Wait. As she turns back, John steps forward and kisses her. Although taken by surprise, Sarah quickly succumbs to his passion. However, as their kiss intensifies,I better go. OFF Sarah, watching him melt into the downpour...They won't talk.They attacked me. If I hadn't defended myself, I'd be in the ER right now. Would that have been the better choice?I was getting to that. I got a new Legacy. Henri absorbs that revelation.What is it? Henri pulls up a website.That's Sand Dollar Beach.Can you take it down? Henri remains ice calm and starts typing commands.I'm sorry, Henri.blur ACROSS THE FRAME of one of the surveillance camera screens and disappear into the woods.I don't know what you think happened tonight... Sam steps closer, watery reflections ripple down his face.What do you want from me?I'm a survivor from a planet called Lorien. Sam absorbs this confession with awe.Henri's not my dad. He's my Guardian. If he found out you knew about us, we'd be gone by morning.That doesn't prove anything.You going to be okay?You look wiped. Henri turns and smiles playfully.Sarah texted me. I went over to her house. Henri buys the explanation and swings back to his computers.There must be a way.I want to help. Henri takes a gulp of coffee and stands.They died.It was a long time ago. It's just me and my dad now. John uses a nail brush to clean the beagle's ears.It takes him a while to warm up to people. Sarah considers this.I don't know. Are there going to be a lot of people?Just giving Bernie a quick bath.Sarah invited us to Thanksgiving. I told her we'd be there.You shouldn't go alone. It could be dangerous.Don't you ever get lonely? Surprised by the question, Henri swivels to face him.You know what I mean. All these years, there's never been anyone.What was her name? Henri slots a plate onto the draining board.You left her to save me.You can't protect me from everything. OFF Henri's sad smile of acknowledgement...Just taking it all in. She crosses.It's okay. Let her take it. The gesture means the world to Sarah. He puts his arm around her. Sarah nestles her face against his. As the flash WIPESI need to check in with Henri. He exits.It's Henri. I have to go. Sorry. OFF her confused disappointment as the truck SQUEALS away...Thanks. I owe you.Death scars.Abduct people? No. Irritated, he covers them back up.They're capable of anything.Number 417. Henri tracked the URL to that house. Sam scans the street.He would have parked it across town. Sam opens the glove compartment and pulls out a revolver.I called you because I needed a ride, not a sidekick. If I could have run here, I would have.I told you to go!Henri's here. John \u00e2\u0080\u009cturns off\u00e2\u0080\u009d his palm and reaches for the door handle. Sam anxiously swats his arm away.Telekinesis -- but that's a work in progress.Sam, we drove here. Sam takes a deep breath, psyching himself up.New plan -- follow Lucky Strike. Text me if he comes back. Sam sneaks off after Frank.Henri! He races over. But as he reaches for Henri's gag, a YOUNG MAN steps out of the shadows holding a baseball bat. John turns too late and the bat strikes his left side. He drops the dagger as he falls to the floor, his ribs searing. The man, BRET, raises the bat again. John focuses his mind.Your life is my life, remember? Henri tries to shake his drug-induced haze.We have to leave! John helps Henri up, they race for the stairs when Bret's hand grabs John's ankle, tripping him to the floor.Henri! Henri smashes his boot into Bret's face, knocking him out for good. John staggers up, they spin for the stairs just asTell me what you know! Franks says nothing. John trains his palm light on the big man's face. It's like a blinding interrogation lamp.Start talking!Did you?Sam, get us out of here! Sam reaches into his jeans, then frantically checks his pockets.I can't. Henri's calm eyes never leave him.We'll meet you back at the house.Nothing. Forget about us. We never existed.Henri, this is insane. They still don't know where we live. Henri seethes.Since Halloween. Henri is floored and hurt by the admission.Only because I knew how you'd react and I didn't want to leave Paradise. Henri paces, tries to quell his emotions.No. His tone is defiant.I'm not leaving without saying goodbye to Sarah. Henri fixes him with a steel-edged stare.I need to talk to Sarah.She's special to me too.Where's Sarah?I'm sorry about last night. She pulls away, her relief turning to anger.I couldn't leave without seeing you one last time. She looks at him, crushed.We're going to be fine.The truth is I'm not who you think I am. You need to forget about me. Okay?Because it's the only way to keep you safe.Goodbye, Sarah. He doesn't look back as he walks out the door. CAMERA STAYS ON SARAH as she sinks onto the bed and the dogs comfort her.Call 911! As he races inside...Sarah!Where's Sarah?Don't let go of him. I promise I won't let go of you.You okay? She stares at him, unsure.I'll explain everything... but not here... Sarah... please? As they take off into the woods, the IMAGE FREEZES, then REWINDS. John and Sarah kneel in the shadows, then FLY BACKWARDS up through the window and INTO the burning house. REVERSE TO REVEAL the Red-Haired Teen watching playback on his FlipVideo camera, amazed. He runs to the back of the house and finds Mark.Please don't look at me like that.It is for me.My name isn't John. I don't have a name, just a number. 4. In fact, my whole life can be reduced to numbers: like 15 million -- that's how many light years it takes to get from my planet to Earth. 38 -- that's how many towns I've lived in. Or 3,671 -- that's how many days I've been running from an enemy that wants me dead. I lied to you, Sarah, because I lie to everyone. That's how I stay alive. Tears of relief brim as he finally reveals his soul.I shouldn't be telling you any of this. It's dangerous. Emotionally spent, John leans against a tree. She steps towards him and brushes her hand down his cheek.I want that too. But if I stay you could get hurt. I have to leave to keep you safe. Sarah absorbs the bitter reality, reaches for his hand.High school.Too late... they're here.Who the hell are you?On his way. Where's yours?Tracking them?The war starts tonight.What are we up against?It'll take us out to the stadium. Six acknowledges that info with a curt nod. FOOTSTEPS. Six grabs John and Sarah by their arms and yanks them back against the wall. They hold their breath as one of the Mogadorian Soldiers prowls straight past. He stops for a moment, then turns the corner. Sarah looks across at the mirrored trophy case and sees there's no reflection.You got any other Legacies?Lumen and telekinesis. More FOOTSTEPS. John turns and watches in horror as the Mogadorian Commander and a trio of Mogadorian Soldiers sweeps into view. The Commander is holdingHe's not dying because of me!Mark! Linoleum! Now! Mark rips free and hits the deck a second before the trophy case EXPLODES. Shards of glass rip into the Mogadorians and trophies torpedo off the shelves and impale the aliens against the far wall. The Mogadorians SCREAM as they flail. John, Sarah and Six break cover. John wrenches Mark to his feet and they take off running. They dash around the next corner and findThis isn't your fault -- it's mine. He offers Mark his hand. Mark shakes it. Suddenly, Bernie begins to GROWL.Bernie! He watches as the beagle sprints forward and launches himself at the monster. Bernie clamps onto the Piken's neck. He's hopelessly outmatched and holds on for dear life as the Piken tries to buck him off. Then something amazing happens --Guess I wasn't the only one keeping secrets.sees two Mogadorian Soldiers hauling heavy-duty weapons that use the glass cartridges that glow on their ammo belts. One FIRES another round. John telekinetically RIPS a door off its hinges. It flies forward, blocks the charge and IGNITES. John spins back and SCREAMS --Go! Go! Go! They take off. John follows and uses his telekinesis to fling cabinets, doors, benches anything he can to block the fiery onslaught. But the rounds are coming too fast and a projectile SMACKS him in the back. It's like being hit by napalm. As FLAMES wash across him, he looks up and snaps onWe're not leaving without my friends.We stay and fight. OFF his determination...Save it for the Mogs. Let's go!The door's over here. The tunnel leads out to the stadium. Sarah sweeps back the curtain, revealing a padlocked set of metal doors. John holds up his hand, snaps the lock and whips the chain free. The doors fly open,Don't stop! Get to the woods! She nods and exits with the others. John and Henri head onto the field after them whenNooooooooooooooooooooooooo! The Piken pivots, turns its crimson eyes on John. It almost seems to smirk. Its fangs are stained with Henri's blood. John's face hardens into a mask of rage.Henri. Henri GROANS as John cradles his head. His coat is soaked with blood and his torso is horribly mauled. John tries to drag him to his feet.Come on, taillights in five.We go together! Henri smiles, grateful, but at that momentNothing is inevitable.You good to go?Sam, ride with Six.You need to stay here.You could have died last night. I'm not putting you in danger again. Mark's promised to look after you.I'll come back for you.When it's safe. She bows her head, anguished. He gently lifts her chin.Where I'm from, we only give our heart to one person. I've given mine to you.This is the first town I've left without Henri. The first one I have a reason to come back to. John and Sarah hold each other's gaze, desperately trying to brand the image of their faces onto their memories.He warned me the pain would be unbearable if I left her. He was right.But I don't regret it. The pain reminds me what's at stake. A dust trail plumes as the bikes power into view.We must find the others and face our enemy together. I'm not sure how we can stop them. But nothing is inevitable. I know that now. Thunderheads darken the horizon.I am Number 4. His eyes are fearless and his face is undaunted by the battles yet to be fought. He's ready to face a future unmapped and uncharted.

How long have you had him? John turns away.No worries. He begins walking towards the entrance.You just moved into the house on Old Mill Road. It's John, right?Don't worry, I'm not stalking you. My mom said she rented it to a guy with a son my age. Since I know every other face on this quad, that had to be you.Where are you from?I don't think that qualifies as an actual answer.Capturing your first day, even though you're technically six weeks late.Afraid the camera's going to steal your soul? She lifts the viewfinder to her eye, adjusts focus. Annoyed, he covers the lens with his hand.It's only for the yearbook. John regains his composure.How'd you do it? Her accusation startles him.Eviscerate the entire senior class? She pulls a strip of overexposed 35mm film from her coat.I was in the darkroom before lunch and they were hanging on the line smiling and looking forward to the future. When I got back, I found 15 rolls of negatives wiped clean. John shrugs innocently.So you weren't in the darkroom today?Here's a tip. If you're going to lie, don't leave a big red backpack at the scene of the crime. She swings his backpack into view. John is mortified. He struggles to find a plausible answer and silently tries to quell the feeling welling in his chest.Digital sucks. Film tells the truth. Clearly, I'm not going to get that from you. He watches as she angrily heads down the steps and climbs into her car. John glances at his palms and is surprised to find they are dimly luminescent.disappearing into a room at the end. He's torn, then makes a decision and does something he shouldn't -- he strides down the hall after her.I think you have the wrong room. She rises, walks past him and begins searching the photos scattered on the layout table in the middle of the space.Does the apology come with an explanation? He turns to go, has his hand on the door when --Wait. He looks back. Her face softens.How about we delete Monday and start over? She steps forward and extends her hand.I'm Sarah.Nice gloves. She crosses to the board, reaches down to lift it when John steps behind her.Curse of a small town. I've been around them my whole life. Kim Thomas. She peed in her bed at a sleepover when we were seven.So what's your story?Determined to keep the mystery alive, aren't you? His finger arrows in on a photograph of Sarah. It's a candid and she's taking a shot with her trademark Nikon.Okay. Recovering cheerleader. Wannabe vegetarian but I still love burgers. Dreams of being a photojournalist.You ever feel you don't belong in your own life?Wow. That almost sounded like a straight answer. They look at each other. There's a charged silence. The moment is broken when --I thought you were on two-a-days.John was helping me move some boards. John turns to Sarah.I don't have time for this, Mark.You were following me?You've crossed so many lines I can't even speak to you right now. She hustles out of the room. Mark glares at John.John. He turns in surprise as Sarah approaches.I heard about the lockers. I'm sorry.I broke up with Mark. He stops, slowly turns back.I've been thinking about doing it for a while... today just finally pushed me over the edge.I don't know.Halloween Block Party's tonight.I'll be on Main Street hiding behind my camera if you want to swing by. He says nothing.I wasn't expecting an actual response. I could text you later. Do they have cell phones on Planet John? She holds out her phone. John looks at it tentatively, then takes it. As he inputs his number, he hears the BLARE of a car horn, looks up and sees Henri waiting in his SUV.You made it. Like the T-shirt, Sam.What do you think of Halloween in Paradise? John regards a particularly over-the-top float.Well, you haven't had the full experience until you've been on the Haunted Hayride.Give me a sec. She steps to the face-painting booth. It's sponsored by the local realtor who is Sarah's mom, Annie. Sarah hands Annie her camera. Sam whispers to John.You guys ready?Sam's cool.I haven't really talked to him since 8th grade. Mark had a tight circle. If you weren't a jock or cheerleader, you didn't exist.Me too. OFF their growing connection...Not even a flinch. None of this scares you, does it?You can smile. I was starting to have my doubts. She takes his hand. They CLATTER past a series of grislyOnce we make it through, we're home free.That was insane.Just part of the ride. He turns, sees a flash of purple light and hears the rustle of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS on all sides.Let go! Stop it! John tries to stand, but a boot CRACKS him in the ribs. Another strikes the side of his face. He is surrounded. His attackers are brutal and unrelenting. Over the LOOPING SOUNDTRACK OF B-MOVIE NOISES, Sarah's muffled SCREAMS DIM.Let go of me! She futilely tries to wrestle free.Help! Somebody! Something about her terrified tone alerts Sam.Are you crazy! Where's John? Mark nods the Zombie Jocks away.I swear if you hurt him --Get out of my face, Mark, you're pathetic.John! Are you okay? He nods. Mark looks past him, confused.John! Stop! Mark is in real pain. Transfixed with anger, John keeps twisting. Sarah looks at him, pleading.That's his throwing arm! But he doesn't stop until she finally steps forward and slaps him across the face. Startled, John lets go.Football's all he's got. John stumbles back, ashamed, and heads into the woods. Sarah offers Mark a look of disgust and follows after John.John! Wait. Sarah catches up.I'm sorry, I didn't want you to break his arm.I had no idea Mark would pull something like that. He has seriously gone off the deep end.That's not love. Their eyes meet in the moonlight.Walk me home?This is me. John stares at the dozen jack-o'-lanterns arranged on the porch. They glare back with flickering bucktooth grins.I know. Wait until the Christmas decorations go up. My mom decks the halls with so many lights, you can see our house from space. Stray TRICK-OR-TREATERS race past. She motions to the cut above his eye, concerned.You should see a doctor.You're not going to tell me how you took out those football players, are you?I really don't get you. She steps closer.But I feel like I can trust you.Good night. Sarah swings open the white picket gate.I don't see any family pictures around. I guess the photo aversion is hereditary. He greets the observation with a shrug. She carries on.Your mom... grandparents. Is there anyone else in your life?I'm sorry.I get the feeling he doesn't like me very much.Thanksgiving's tomorrow. Why don't you bring your dad and celebrate with us?A tsunami of relatives. But don't worry, I'll shield you from the wave. Besides, I want everyone to meet you. She playfully splashes him. Their faces inch closer. They begin making out hot and heavy until Henri suddenly walks in.I better hit the road.Come on, we're on gravy-boat duty.You look dazed.I'm glad you came. They tenderly kiss until Annie bustles in carrying a steaming bowl of mashed potatoes.Mom. No. John really doesn't like having his --I'll see what's taking him so long.John! He looks back.Where is he, Sam?What happened last night? I've tried calling him all day. But his number's no longer in service.I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on.John!No. Not good enough. Sam said you were never coming back. What are you doing here?So it's true. What's going on? What kind of trouble are you and your dad in?Damnit! Whatever it is, I'll understand -- just tell me the truth.Why are you acting like this?Safe from what? He turns away, shields her from his torment.John!You walked through that fire without getting burned. I saw you stop that beam. SIRENS wail in the distance.I'm sorry. I'm still trying to process everything I saw and I keep coming to the same conclusion -- what you did isn't possible.Who are you? For once please tell me the truth. It's the hardest thing he's ever had to do.I don't care. I just want to be with you.There's something I want to give you first.So you'll always remember me. With exquisite tenderness they kiss. John's palms shimmer. The intensity of the luminescence builds with their rising passion. They sink to the floor and the light crescendos in an ethereal flash that BLEACHES OUT THE FRAME.It's Henri.The gym, there's a tunnel under the stage.We're invisible. John realizes, turns to Six.What are you doing with them?The gym's this way. A projectile HISSES past John's ear and DETONATES a row of lockers -- BOOOOOM! -- it's like an incendiary grenade. The paint blisters off the lockers as they are consumed by FIRE.Where's John?Oh my God... John. Before anyone can stop her, she takes off running, sprinting for the stadium.John! She charges across the broiled expanse, hoping against hope. Then she sees John, lying motionless and naked, his clothes completely burned away. She stops, puts her hand to her mouth to stifle a sob, when he COUGHS and stirs.John! Ash swirls like snow as she races to his side. They wrap each other in their arms. Neither wanting to ever let go.Sorry, Girl Scout first aid didn't cover extraterrestrial dagger wounds. Six smiles, grateful.I want to come too.Why?I don't want to say goodbye.When?", "clean_line": "trained long john turns away worries begins walking entrance moved house old road john right worry

Quarterback, sheriff's son, he's three years into the best four years of his life. John begins retrieving the fallen books. Sam helps.Do yourself a favor -- stay off his radar.You were talking to Sarah Harte.Mark and Sarah have been exclusive since Freshmen year.If there's another guy in her airspace, he shoots them down. You got a warning shot. John piles the books into his locker.Look, you're new, so let me tell you how things work in this misnamed backwater. Football players are gods -- the rest of us are mere mortals. If you want to survive, keep your head down and don't make waves.Obviously a wise man.First day here and you're already destroying school property. So much for not making waves. John moves past him and grabs a tray. He's flushed and his face is now hot and red.I hear the real spectator sport was Mark and Sarah's blowout. John wipes his brow, distracted.Dude, you okay?Dude, hold up! John leans against the wall, keeping his hands out of sight.You look like crap. I'll get the nurse. But as Sam runs off, John heads in the other direction.Nice freakout the other day.Assholes. John looks back at Sam. Mark seizes his chance and launches a sucker-punch at John. But John sees it out of the corner of his eye and in a blur of motion whips up his hand andI raided lost and found. He holds up a puke-green sweater decorated with red snowmen. John turns back to the sink.I know. Nobody loses anything cool. He sits and begins to change.Dude, the way you thrashed Mark back there. Awesome move. John acknowledges that with a nod. Whip-dries his shirt. Sam plucks up the photo. The ink is now dried and cracked.My dad. My real dad. I took it the summer before he split.He dragged me and my mom all over the Yucatan. He was looking for evidence of ancient astronauts. All I got was Montezuma's Revenge.I know. Insane. He called himself an anthropologist even though he only made it through one semester of college. He rises and tosses the ruined picture into the trash.Always thought he'd come back one day -- who was I kidding. The guy's a joke. As the BELL RINGS...Not by choice. Ed's my stepdad. He's under the delusion that if people eat enough candy apples and kettle corn, they'll suddenly have the urge to buy sporting goods. John plucks a hockey mask from the basket on the counter.I put those on special tonight for any wannabe Jason Voorhees. Sam pulls off his apron, revealing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cFuture Supervillain\u00e2\u0080\u009d.Screw this. Let me lock up. I'll hang with you. He steps to the door and twists the closed sign into view.He hit the tavern at 6:00. He's already hammered by now. I'll probably find him passed out on the doorstep. Every night is trick \u00e2\u0080\u0098r treat at my house.She's over there. John follows Sam's gaze and finds Sarah taking shots of some KIDS dunking for apples. She pulls the camera from her eye, sees John and smiles as he approaches.Guidance Counsellor said I need to set goals for myself. Figured I'd aim high. She looks back at John.I'm impressed. Before John can respond, Sarah steps back.Three on a wagon might get a little crowded. I'll meet you two on the other side. He gives John a not-so-subtle wink of encouragement. John and Sarah join the end of the line and watch Sam head away.Sarah? She doesn't answer. He hesitates a moment, then charges into the woods.I've narrowed it down to three possibilities: you're a genetic experiment, you're a freak of nature, or you're an extraterrestrial.Your hands lit up like a firefly on crack, you tossed those football players around like crash test dummies, and you took off faster than an Olympic runner.I just want to know who you are. John looks at Sam, realizes he's not going to give up. He hesitates, then finally surrenders...Your dad... he's from there too?I won't tell anyone. John nods, grateful.There's something I want to show you.The cops found it abandoned in the middle of Route 20, just south of White Sands, New Mexico. It was my dad's. He went missing six years ago. He was on one of his crazy fact-finding trips. He believed we weren't alone in the universe. Sam rubs his hand across the hood, wondering.Mom figured he was having an affair and took off. All these years I thought she was right. Now you're here.It proves he wasn't crazy. I'm starting to think that he didn't bail on us... that maybe something else happened out there -- that he was taken. The moment is broken by the SLAM of the front door and the sound of ANGRY FOOTSTEPS. Sam instantly tenses.Guess the bar closed.If he finds you here, it'll be worse.Anything to get out of Thanksgiving at my house. He offers John a weary smile.I checked out that blog on the way over. Saw the video. What was the deal with your ankle? John pulls up his khakis, shows Sam the trio of scars.They kind of look like the symbols in my dad's research.How about the ones you said were hunting you?I don't see his SUV anywhere.Stole it from Ed.See anything? Annoyed, John spins and finds Sam creeping towards him.They might know where my dad is! John realizes Sam is determined. He sweeps his hand back over the kitchen door. His palm illuminates a familiarWait! Other than strength, speed and night-light, what powers have you got?No invisibility, X-ray vision, flight?Okay. I'm ready. Let's do it. But as John reaches for the door handle, the kitchen light suddenly turns on and a MAN enters. He's built like a wrestler and goes by the name of FRANK.Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. There's a LOUD CLICK.You just dead bolted it! Way to go!I must have dropped the keys! Henri keeps his cool, looks at John.Hurry up! John's brow is furrowed with concentration. The Mog unsheathes his sword as he runs. With a superhuman leap, he lands on the hood -- TWAAAAACK! John and Henri spin out of the way as the sword SHATTERS the windshield and impales in the back of the seat, missing them by a mouse hair. As the Mogadorian withdraws the sword to strike again, Henri sweeps up his dagger and stakes it into the Mog's neck.Is he serious? John nods, numb.What am I supposed to tell people?I don't know. He tries to avoid eye contact, but she is determined.Forget about him, Sarah. Incredulous, she grabs his arm.He left with Henri and he isn't coming back. Ever.No, but he's all over the internet.Those things from Warsaw -- they're coming, aren't they?The hell it isn't. I'm coming with you. OFF this declaration...What is it, boy? Henri sees where Bernie is staring and realizes...I play a lot of Xbox.I have to find out if the Mogs took my dad.

SILENCE has fallen. Still clenching his fists, John rises and stumbles out into the hall. OFF Sarah's concern as she watches him exit...What's he doing in here? John and Sarah spin to find Mark. Sarah is flustered.Coach wants me to rest my arm before the scouts come. You didn't answer my question?Seriously, Sarah, what's up with this guy?But you had time to go to his house the other night. Sarah looks at him, stunned by the admission.Just trying to figure out what's going on with you. Sarah's shock turns to anger.This isn't over. OFF John, unmoved by the threat...Told you it wasn't over. Behind them, Sam's laid-back persona cracks. He frantically clears his locker, looking for something. He finally pulls out a photo which drips with ink, reels at the jocks.Relax. It's a practical joke.Why do you give a shit?I'm the best thing that ever happened to you and I'm giving you one more chance. Appalled by his hubris, Sarah turns to leave.Don't walk away from me! Mark grabs her. Sarah wrenches free, but loses her balance and falls back on the ground. Mark's rage is transplanted by concern. He steps towards her to help when --Where the hell are Kevin and Joe? John holds up a clutch of night-vision goggles.Hey, those are police property! John flings them over Mark's head into the water.I'm going to kill you! With lightning speed, John grabs Mark's arm, spins him, pinning him to a tree. Blinded by rage, John jerks Mark's arm up behind his back.You weren't invited.She doesn't want to see you. John shoves him aside and heads for the sweeping stairs...It's too late. You can't get through! John ignores him and runs into the inferno.Where are we going? Is this about the fire? It was an accident.Yeah, John Smith. But I didn't invite him.I'll help you find him. He points to Sarah's image on the screen.He's not at Sarah's, I already checked. And one of my dad's deputies drove by his house -- nada.I've got Sarah's cell number, maybe you guys can trace it? The Commander takes the phone and passes it to one of his men in the front. He looks back at Mark.What the hell's in there? He looks back at the Commander who is arming up from the trunk of the SUV. Mark glimpses the arsenal of future-tech machine pistols, double-bladed swords and heavy-duty daggers. He backs away in fearful realization.You guys aren't FBI. Before he can run, a Mogadorian Soldier grabs him by the neck and constrains him. The Commander pullsThey said they were FBI. That John was a fugitive. What the hell's going on?I didn't know they were trying to kill you. I'm sorry.My dad's the sheriff. He slides two across the floor. The door opens.
