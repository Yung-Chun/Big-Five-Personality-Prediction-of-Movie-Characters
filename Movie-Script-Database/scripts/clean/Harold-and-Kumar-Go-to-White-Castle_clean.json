J.D. notices his friend pining over the photo.Oh God. Give me that. I'm burning it once and for all. J.D. snatches the photo, and pulls out his lighter. Just as the flame is about to touch the photo, BILLY grabs it back.Dude, it's been six months. You have to move on. BILLY nods knowingly.You know what'll cheer you up? Some hot chick riding your jock all night long.It would help get your mind off of Sarah. BILLY ponders this for a moment.Billy, you come out with me tonight, and I promise you'll get laid.So what? It's Friday! You have all weekend to do that.Well, why don't you just get somebody else to do your work then?And make sure it's in tomorrow by nine o'clock sharp.Dude, how do you think I get all my shit done? I'm telling you -- those Asian guys love crunching numbers. You probably just made his weekend. The guys have reached J.D.'S CONVERTIBLE.Now get ready. It's time we embark on...Operation Get Some! And with that, J.D. presses a button in his car that causes the top of the convertible to go down and a funky white boy song kicks in. Intercut:Hey, Billy-- you paying for this or what?Hey! What the hell is going on here?Cock boy? I'm sorry, but did you just call me \"cock boy?\"Oh, I'm not quick enough? He thinks I'm not quick enough. Well, I got news for you... I am quick enough... ...cock boy! J.D. is embarrassed. BILLY tries to placate the situation.Don't even bother with him.

BILLY drops a big stack of papers on Harold's desk.Fuck.I'm not gonna be able to partake in our usual Friday night ritual. I've gotta stay late at the office.I know, but I gotta get this work done.Listen, I'd love to go home, but...Yes! Right in front... Harold carefully lines up his car to parallel park. As he starts to pull in, A YELLOW JEEP STEALS THE SPOT FROM BEHIND. The jeep is loaded with \"alternative\" stickers, and has a KAYAK, HANG-GLIDER, and other sports equipment on the roof. Harold almost hits the JEEP. He knows this car.Those assholes. The driver, COLE , puts down his window... COLE is joined in the jeep with his EXTREME SPORTS PUNK FRIENDS, who all laugh at Harold.Okay, be yourself. Don't be nervous.So Maria, what's been going on?My week was great. Work wasn't too bad. I caught up on some sleep. Plus, the guy who works next to me decided to bathe for a change.Oh wait, I meant the exact opposite of that. Work sucked. I barely slept. And the guy next to me still smells like crap. But a man can dream, right?So what are you up to tonight?Really?That sounds awful. Harold laughs, as does Maria. They smile at each other...Well, if you want some company, maybe you could sit on your ass at my place.Bye.Kumar?Kumar?Kumar, what the hell are you doing!Why aren't you doing this in your room!I'm gonna puke. Get your clothes on.Are those my scissors? Oh my God! I trim my nose hair with those!Other than my roommate's boney ass?One of the senior analysts asked me to do a bunch of his work for him tonight. Kumar walks back into Harold's room...If by \"go fuck yourself\" you mean \"no problem sir\" then yes, he got the message loud and clear. KUMAR shakes his head in disgust...No. I got a lot of work to finish. Kumar shuts Harold's laptop.One joint.Don't you think you should take at least one of your interviews seriously? At some point your dad's gonna get really pissed.Well, then what are you going to do?Sounds like a plan.Nice. Sixteen Candles is on.Oh come on. It's a John Hughes movie! It's a classic! It's a beautiful story about someone who feels unnoticed, unappreciated, unloved...We're so high right now.I don't know about you, but I'm hungry as balls.What about KFC?You're sure you know how to get there? I haven't been to White Castle in ages.Is that all you Jews ever think about? Tits?You're driving. I'm gonna try to get some of my work done in the car. Kumar then checks his pockets and comes up empty.Why don't you just run back and get it?I'm not worthwhile.It doesn't matter. The only girls interested in me are girls I have no interest in. Like Cindy Kim.God, she invites me to everything.Why do I have to be the catcher?Don't even start.Of course he's gay! You remember in the first Star Wars when he was like... \"Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel soooo good!\" Kumar laughs.I don't have anymore change.No. I don't like breaking the law. Harold licks the joint as he puts the finishing touches on.Just hold on. I'll walk over to one of the manned booths and tell them what happened. The honking continues as HAROLD starts to open the door...Are you crazy?Oh shit, we're dead! Harold throws the joint out the window.You just tore out of there! The cops are gonna catch us!Take this exit!Look, I get a little paranoid sometimes.Maybe it's not as bad as they say. It's probably just a bunch of hype. They look out the window and see another ASIAN and INDIAN guy walking down the street. Suddenly, THREE HOODS jump out from an alley and start beating the living shit out of Daniel and Shankar. Kumar gives Harold a dirty look.Let's get the hell out of here. KUMAR continues driving. He makes a turn. All of a sudden, he stops short, causing he and HAROLD to jerk forward quickly.What the...Dude, we are NOT driving through that basketball game!Forget about it. No way.Turn the car around.For some reason, I don't think this is the same thing.Don't! The BASKETBALL PLAYERS slowly begin moving aside.Shit, he's gonna throw the ball at us.Look at him! The HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN has an ESPECIALLY ANGRY FACE.That was close, dude.Yes! Thank God! I'm starving!Oh man, I'm so hungry. I'm gonna eat like twenty of those burgers.God, where the hell is this place?There's the multiplex!What the hell's going on, Kumar?! That doesn't look like a White Castle to me!Are you sure?I don't know. Should we just eat here?Kumar, I have a shitload of work to finish. And you have that med school interview in the morning.Let's do it.Agreed.Why?Oh no. I'm not seeing Cindy.She calls me. Then she rambles on about her East Asian Students club or whatever.You know, yellow on the outside, white on the inside.Well, I can't help you out there. Cindy doesn't smoke. She's not gonna help us.No, forget it. I'm not seeing Cindy Kim.Yeah. Me too.Uh, yeah. They were...nice. Suddenly, one of the nerdy Asian students raises his hand. HAROLD looks at him strangely, and then over to Cindy. \"Does this guy think I'm a teacher or something?\" Harold sits there and stares at Kenneth for a while...Uh, yes?Yeah, I'm a junior analyst.Yes?What it's like being an investment banker? Well Kenneth, to be honest, it's pretty... HAROLD looks into the eyes of the young, eager, Asian students. He can't bear to tell them the truth......awesome? All the Asian students start high-fiving with each other.As for the recommendation, I may be able to make a call or two... CINDY looks at her watch...Sorry, Cindy. I can't go. I have to wait for Kumar...Nice. CINDY grabs HAROLD's hand and drags him away.Let's go to the party for a little while.Look, what do you want me to say? I was under pressure.Shit! What if he finds us?Ew...gross. CLARISSA runs into STALL NUMBER ONE and shuts the door. The sound of the door shutting causes HAROLD and KUMAR to look over at that stall.Shit!Oh, come on, you always exaggerate. We weren't gonna get laid.I know Cindy's cute, it's just...Look, it doesn't matter. I'm gonna end up with Cindy anyway. It's just more practical. Now can we drop this and get our asses to White Castle?Now what are you doing?Do you even know where you're going?We better. It starts to rain...Shit, now it's raining.Look, I'm completely on edge right now, okay? After all the shit we've been through tonight, I don't know how much more of this I can take.Shit! It bit my neck! I probably have rabies now or something!Oh, that's not good!Uh-oh. KUMAR rolls down his window. The DRIVER peers inside...We haven't gotten there yet. I think I got rabies, though.Will you stop it? I'm feeling very woozy. I may have to go to the hospital.I don't have rabies. Kumar stands up quickly.Oh, now I see why you didn't want to come to the hospital. Kumar gives Harold an annoyed look as his dad approaches.Wow. So I guess you're going to med school after all, huh?But...you just hugged him...If we get caught, you're taking the blame. This wasn't my idea.What the hell's going on here?Oh shit! This guy's gonna die!!!Wait. Hold on. You see you got this all wrong. We're not doc... KUMAR interrupts before HAROLD can tell her the truth.I'm telling you. That was amazing! Even your dad would've been impressed!This is perfect! We're back on the road. We have directions now. The rain let up. And guess what...I'm officially done with my work. I'm telling you, things are finally starting to go our way. While they're stopped at a red light, Kumar takes in his surroundings and notices something...Holy shit.No way. Forget about it. Just drive. Kumar puts his hands on Harold's shoulders to get his undivided attention.Stop it.Let's just go! KUMAR presses a button CAUSING HAROLD'S WINDOW TO GO DOWN.What are you doing?!You asshole! My car's probably all scratched up now!I told you I didn't want to speak to her! Whatever. Let's jut get back on the highway.Godammit. You know how to change a flat?Where's my spare tire?Shit, where the hell is it? Kumar suddenly remembers...What bridge? What the hell are you talking about?Your bad? What are the hell are we gonna do now?! Suddenly, they see AN OLD PICK-UP TRUCK driving in their direction. HAROLD and KUMAR wave it down. The truck stops in front of them. The door opens and a SHADOWY FIGURE begins walking towards them. Harold and Kumar are nervous. As soon as the FIGURE reaches them, LIGHTENING STRIKES.Thanks for helping us out.So where exactly are we going?Will you shut up? He's right next to me! He can hear you! KUMAR sees that A WHITE PUSS IS NOW OOZING FROM THE BOIL.What's the matter with you? You think that just because you're whispering, he can't hear what you're saying? He's two feet away from us. He can hear this entire conversation. He can hear me talking right now.He couldn't have said that.Who cares? You've seen Freak Show. What do you think his wife is gonna look like?Okay. It's official. We've entered the Twilight Zone.She's not ugly. LIANE comes in with the pitcher of lemonade. She pours them drinks and hands them the glasses...Can I ask-- how does a guy...like Freak Show...end up with a woman like yourself?Wait a second-- what about Freak Show...and this whole Christian thing you guys have going on?No, I just... Liane starts playing with the knot in her shirt. Harold and Kumar stare unabashedly. Harold looks outside the window, where he sees Freak Show changing the tire, apparently busy.Nevermind. Okay, rock, paper, scissors...Huh?Sorry, no thank you.Forget it! I don't want our balls rubbing against each other. No way! KUMAR turns to LIANE in desperation...Okay, let's do that. Liane takes Harold's hands and places them on her breasts. Kumar looks on enviously. Liane moans in pleasure as Harold starts to massage her chest. AT THAT MOMENT, FREAK SHOW ENTERS THE ROOM, holding a particularly threatening TIRE-IRON...Uhh...you said outside that we can have sex with her! FREAK SHOW runs over to HAROLD and grabs him by the collar!Agreed.And get chopped to bits? Are you crazy? Kumar pulls over to the side of the road...Fuck that! It's my car! We're not picking up a hitchhiker! The back door opens and Neil , gets into the car.Uh...excuse me, but...are you Neil Patrick Harris?Hey, you don't know how to get back on the highway, do you?Huh?We'll be right back, Neil. NEIL shakes his head, disappointed. Harold and Kumar start walking over to the CONVENIENCE STORE.What's the deal with Neil Patrick Harris? Why's he so horny?Oh shit. These idiots. Cole and the Two Punks push past Harold and Kumar and walk into the store. Harold and Kumar enter after them...Excuse me-- can you tell us how to get onto the highway from here? The INDIAN CASHIER shrugs his shoulders.Huh? Oh, good.Somebody should do something.I didn't mean you should do something. Cole slowly walks over to Kumar. The two stand face to face. Cole looks pissed, but Kumar keeps his confident exterior. It's a tense moment. Suddenly, Cole makes a quick motion as if he was going to hit Kumar, trying to get him to flinch. Kumar stands his ground without flinching, still looking Cole in the eye. The Punks don't know what to think as their leader is shown up. Seemingly impressed by Kumar, Cole begins to turn around as if he's going to walk away, but he quickly doubles back, doing the same fake punch he did before. Caught off guard, this time Kumar flinches like a nervous weakling...Kumar-- you okay?Did Doogie Howser just steal my fucking car?Why the hell did you leave the keys in the car?!This is all your fault! This whole fucking night! You know I leased that car! They're gonna make me pay for it! Harold starts to walk back to the convenience store.I'm going to call the police! I don't want to talk to you anymore! Harold is about to walk in, when he sees Cole wind up and throw a Hostess-like snowball right in the Cashier's face. \"Extremes\" all around!I'm not speaking to you. Harold waits for the \"DON'T WALK\" sign to change. It doesn't. HE STARTS PRESSING THE \"WALK\" BUTTON REPEATEDLY.Thank you, Mr. Wizard. HAROLD waits for a few seconds, but when the light doesn't change, he begins pressing the button again.Jesus Christ! When are they gonna fucking develop button technology that'll understand urgency? The \"DON'T WALK\" sign still won't change. Kumar looks to the left and then to the right. The street is completely empty and there is no place for a police car to hide.It'll change in a second. They stand there for another ten seconds. It doesn't change.Alright fine. You want me to cross? I'll cross. Just leave me alone! Harold starts walking angrily across the street.Shit! Harold walks back over to Kumar, clearly upset within him, as OFFICER PALUMBO gets out of the car and walks over to them...Good evening. Is there a problem, Officer...Palumbo?Yes. Yes I have. I'm so sorry. I promise I'll never do it again.Let me apologize for my friend. I promise I will pay the fine. But actually, I'm glad you're here. You know the TV show Doogie Howser, M.D? You see, Doogie Howser just stole my car and...Kumar, shut up...Harold. Harold is starting to pacify Palumbo.Thank you. OFFICER PALUMBO hands Harold his ticket and begins to walk away.Kumar, I swear to God, if you don't...Oh shit.Hey, are you gonna do something about my car? Hello? Palumbo is in the main office area, dealing with HIPPIE ASSHOLE and his MOM. The Mom hands Officer Palumbo a check.Can I at least give you my car's licence plate number? Ignoring Harold, Palumbo turns up the volume on his radio...So what are you in here for?Come on. Seriously. TARIK sits up. He looks at OFFICER PALUMBO who, with his Walkman on, is oblivious to their conversation.Holy shit. What did you do?That fucking blows! Tarik nods and continues reading his book. Harold sees that Tarik is remarkably relaxed.I don't understand how you're able to be so calm about all this.Assaulting an officer.No. I actually did hit the cop. But only because I was trying to hit my friend. Well, ex-friend.That was strange. Suddenly, a loud banging sound is made from a VENTILATION SHAFT on the ceiling, above one of the officer's desks.What the hell was that?Kumar?! What the fuck are you doing?!No, they... Wait a second, did you...Jesus Christ! What did you do that for?!Forget it! I don't want to get in any more trouble! I'm already in here because of you!Well, I never got your car stolen!Hey asshole, I'm in jail! Don't bitch to me about your problems! Just leave me alone. I don't want your help.How the hell should I know?Jesus Christ. Tarik shakes his head.And become a fugitive? Are you nuts? The guy has all my information. Harold points to Palumbo's desk, which has the police report, Harold's I.D., and his laptop.Fine. Hurry up. Kumar smiles. He begins searching for a key.Kumar, hurry the fuck up! Kumar runs over to the cell door. He tries out a couple keys, when he suddenly smells something...Kumar?...Kumar! Kumar can't hear Harold. He's in a trance. We begin to hear a romantic song as Kumar stares lovingly at the BAG OF WEED...What the hell are you... Suddenly, all six police officer come back into the room, pushing a black man wearing pajamas . Nathaniel seems very gentle. He's even wearing a turtleneck sweater.Wait-- shouldn't we do something about this?Jesus Christ! That place was a fucking mad house! Thanks for getting me out of there, dude.What was that?Aren't people supposed to be scared of coyotes?We're gonna die.We're gonna die.This isn't working.He likes me. Suddenly, Kumar's eyes light up...What is it?Has it come to this? Are we really gonna ride this cheetah?This is either a really smart move, or by far the stupidest thing we've ever done. HAROLD puts his arms around KUMAR to hold on. Kumar puts the bag of weed under his shirt...Dude, am I just really high or is this is actually working?!This is great! We'll be at White Castle in no...I love you, Maria. MARIA gets up and runs away. HAROLD playfully chases her. Maria runs over to a FRENCH FRY TREE. SHE PLUCKS A COUPLEWhat the hell are you doing?!!!What happened to the cheetah?Tell me the worse news first.That sucks. What's the bad news?Why the hell didn't you say that THAT was the \"worse news\"?Oh no! No! No!It's not that! All my work was saved in there! Now I gotta go back to the office and re-do everything!Forget White Castle. There's no time!Look! Through the window, we see ROSENBERG and GOLDSTEIN inside, sitting at a booth. They both have a dozen donuts and five cartons of milk. It looks like they just sat down... Goldstein savors his first bite of his POWDERED BLUEBERRY FILLED DONUT and Rosenberg licks his fingers after his first bite of his CHOCOLATE CREAM FILLED DONUT. HAROLD and KUMAR watch through the window longingly...I want that.No. I want that feeling. The feeling that comes over a man when he finally gets exactly what he desires. I NEED that feeling.We gotta go to White Castle. KUMAR gives HAROLD a hug.Hey, why don't you just leave us alone?Nothing. Harold turns around and starts walking towards the Krispee Kreme entrance. Kumar follows. In the background Cole and the Punks are laughing about what a \"pussy\" Harold is.Don't worry. The universe tends to unfold as it should. Kumar gives a \"What the fuck is he talking about?\" look.Besides, I have a plan. Follow my lead...I'm stealing their car.It's working isn't it?I had to do something. KUMAR begins sniffing something in the air...This world is so unfair.No. I've got everything under control. We should be able to get there with enough time for me to get my work done after our feast. Just find us some tunes. A tape is resting in the tape deck. KUMAR pushes it in... HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other amazed that COLE has some lame chick song on his tape.I'm not going back to jail! We've come too far! Now buckle up.Just hold on!Don't worry. We're gonna make it. Everything's gonna be...Oh shit! We're trapped! Kumar notices something...No. No way. Not a chance. I'd rather turn myself in than die.You hang-glided? I don't remember that.No, Kumar. I'm not risking my life over a bunch of hamburgers. KUMAR walks over to HAROLD and stares him in the eye...I hate you, Kumar.Hurry up...they're almost here!I think so.Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!I can't believe you lied to me!Dude, we're so high right now.Hey, Kumar?How are we gonna get down?That's a great answer. Made me feel really comfortable. Thanks a lot. KUMAR looks down as they fly over a playground.Is it a problem if we fly into birds?Because we're about to! KUMAR looks up and sees at least A HUNDRED CROWS FLYINGAhhhh! My eyes! Don't peck out my eyes!I hate you! I hate you so much!That's it...I'm gonna kill you...That's the point!You're gonna die!I want thirty slyders. I want five french fries. I want four large Cherry cokes.Hey...hey...hey...where's my money?!Where's my fucking car you prick!Thanks, I guess. NEIL hands them some cash...What happened to the car?Where are you going?I know. I can't believe we made it. AND we got the car back! If we can just get out of here in a half hour, I can get back to my office and get the work done.Hey, good for those black guys!Oh...that hit the spot.Mine too. The two of them sit there, looking at all the empty containers and wrappers. After a long pause of silence, KUMAR speaks...Seriously?Uh-huh.I'll be right back... At that moment, BILLY and J.D. walk in the restaurant with their women, ZOE and TRACY, respectively. TRACY looks like some bimbo slut that J.D. picked up at a strip club. ZOE, On the other hand, has a sweet RENEE ZELLWEGER quality about her. She and Billy are the perfect Hollywood couple...What the fuck is going on here? BILLY turns around and sees HAROLD...Never mind me. What are you doing here? I thought you and J.D. were busy all night with \"clients.\" Isn't that why I had to do YOUR work?Back off, cock boy! What I have to say to him goes double for you! KUMAR sees what's going on-- he can't believe it.Yeah, you know I did. You're just stalling because you're not quick enough to think of a comeback.Tell him what? That I'm your work horse! That you guys think you can just party all weekend and leave all your work to the quiet Asian guy in your office! Huh? J.D. is stunned. Now he's a little nervous.No, YOU don't understand. I'm not doing your work anymore.And I'll tell everyone in the office how you both caught gonorrhea from that whore. TRACI and ZOE hear this and are freaked out. They slowly back away from BILLY and J.D....Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get going. See you on Monday. HAROLD leaves the RESTAURANT. KUMAR follows. Billy and J.D. are left embarrassed and in shock.I don't know. Eating those delicious burgers made me feel like a new man. Now I'm actually looking forward to work this week.I'm not worthless.Beats me. Now, come on, let's get going.I have some unfinished business to take care of. They both get into the car . The car zooms out...Oh...uh...nothing...wrong room.Look, I really don't need to hear it. I guess I just made a mistake. Sorry for interrupting you guys... Harold starts to walk away, almost crying. SAD, DEPRESSING MUSIC BEGINS TO PLAY. Kumar feels sorry for his friend. Just then, Luis leans his head out the door...Huh?Oh! Maria's brother!Actually, I'm Kor...wait a second-- she talks about me? A HOT BLACK CHICK , wearing only a bra and g-string, walks over to Luis and wraps her arms around him...Uh, no thanks. I'd rather do it in person.Huh? Where?What are you talking about? Are you out of your mind? What about your interview with the med school guy?She's coming back in ten days! It's not like I'm never gonna see her again.Forget it. I'll just wait till she comes back.

Symptoms may include fever, sore throat, headaches, white patches on the back of your throat, swollen glands, sluggishness and loss of appetite.Really?Let's see. There might be epigastric tenderness, diffuse abdominal tenderness... Suddenly, we hear what sounds like be a match being lit, a gurgle, and a cough -- the distinct sounds of somebody smoking from a bong. Dr. Woodruff is confused. Kumar pulls out his cell phone. It's his personalized ringer.I'm sorry. Can you hold on one second? Kumar stands up and answers his cell phone.Kumar's phone. Kumar speaking. Oh, hey. Nothing important. I can talk. What's up? Dr. Woodruff is offended. He takes a sip of from a mug of coffee and watches as Kumar begins pacing around the office. Intercut:Fuck that shit! We had plans! Dr. Woodruff can't believe Kumar's choice of words.Oh come on! When has getting high ever prevented you from finishing your work? Dr. Woodruff is so shocked that the mug of coffee simply slips out of his hands. Hot coffee goes all over his shirt. Woodruff yells and starts wiping his shirt with a napkin.No fucking buts! I just bought a quarter of the finest herb in New York City, and I'm not smoking it alone.Okay, where was I? Oh yes. More symptoms of pancreatitis. Um...decreased bowel sounds, possibly fever, dehydration, and sometimes even shock.No. I'd actually be pretty surprised. Dr. Woodruff is flustered. He doesn't know how to react.Look, I'm just interviewing so my dad will keep paying for my apartment. I'm not really planning on going to med school.Well, I'm not an idiot. Dr. Woodruff is at a loss for words. Kumar notices a framed picture of a HOT TEENAGE GIRL on Dr. Woodruff's desk. He picks it up.Wow! Is this your daughter? A disturbed Dr. Woodruff grabs the portrait out of Kumar's hands.Yeah, I'm in here! Harold walks over to Kumar's room and looks inside. It's Martha Stewart's nightmare-- dirty laundry all over the floor, etc. On his walls we see old school gangsta rap posters. MARIJUANA PARAPHERNALIA is everywhere. We see a Giant Photograph of Kumar with his arm around Mr. T. Kumar is not in the room, however.In here... Curious, Harold walks over to HIS ROOM , where he sees KUMAR STANDING BUTT NAKED IN FRONT OF A FULL-LENGTH MIRROR. There's a \"clipping sound\" coming from Kumar's direction. Harold stares at him, shocked and appalled. Harold walks inside...I'm trimming my pubes. Kumar looks at himself in the mirror as he makes a couple more snips. On the floor, we see LARGE CLUMPS OF HAIR.The mirror's in here. Hey, check it out! It looks like a Bonsai tree!Chill out. It makes my Johnson look bigger. Besides, if I don't do this, I'll end up with pubes like my dad. You've seen Osama Bin Laden's beard, right? HAROLD notices something...Dude, I've been cutting my ass hair with them for the past six months.So what the hell is your problem, anyway?I assume you gave him the appropriate \"go fuck yourself.\"Oh, no wonder you tried cancelling on me today. Dude, you gotta learn how to say \"no\" once in a while. Now lets get high.Fuck that! You'll have plenty of time to get that shit done later. Come on, let's smoke a couple joints. Harold thinks for a moment and then caves...One and a half. Now let's do this... Kumar exits the room... HAROLD hangs his jacket up in his closet, which we see organized in rows of suits and button downs.So what? It's not like there's a shortage of Dr. Patel's out there. My dad's a doctor. My brother's a doctor. Just because everyone in my family went to med school, doesn't mean I have to.I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna smoke this fat blunt, get ridiculously high, and then get something to eat.I think we've already seen this one. Harold changes the channel...I love that shit! Harold continues flipping channels...And the award for least heterosexual statement ever made in this apartment goes to...Hey look! It's you! Kumar points to the TV where we see a CLIP FROM SIXTEEN CANDLES--[Long Duk Dong talking about quiche/round pie] Kumar laughs. Harold isn't amused. We see another CLIP [Long Duk talking about the chores he does for the grandparents].Hey, when are you gonna start doing some chores around here? Harold gives Kumar a \"don't even joke\" look. He then violently grabs the bong from Kumar and lights it. Kumar laughs as Harold exhales a lot of smoke...We're not low.No shit! Let's eat! HAROLD bends down and picks up A BUNCH OF DELIVERY MENUS that have been left on the floor...Nah, I don't feel like delivery tonight.Nah, we've been there too many times. I want something we haven't had in awhile. Something different. Something that'll really hit the spot. I want the perfect food...I'm telling you, there's one right around the corner from that multiplex in New Brunswick. They walk down the hallway, stopping at another apartment. On the side of the doorway is a MEZUZAH IN THE SHAPE OF A NAKED WOMAN. Harold and Kumar walk in without knocking...Rosenberg, Goldstein-- get up. We're going to White Castle. Rosenberg and Goldstein continue staring at the TV...No waiting. We're starving... Out of the corner of Kumar's eye, he notices Harold grabbing a piece of beef jerky from Rosenberg & Goldstein's coffee table....Put that down! We're not eating `til we get to White Castle. Harold acts like he's going to put the jerky back, but as soon, as Kumar turns his attention back to Rosenberg and Goldstein, he slips it his pocket.Now come on guys, let's go.What the hell are you bringing that for? Harold hands Kumar his keys.Shit, I forgot my cell phone.Nah, we've gone too far. Reveal that the guys are less than 20 feet from their door. \"Bing!\" The elevator door opens and the guys enter.Hey, there's your girlfriend. You actually gonna talk to her this time?What the hell are you doing? That was a perfect opportunity! You could have asked her if she wanted to go to White Castle. Harold doesn't say anything. He looks down in shame.You're worthless.Dude, it's only awkward because you're a pussy. Just talk to her once and I promise you it won't be weird anymore...Speaking of Cindy, she called earlier. One of those 58 Asian clubs she's in is throwing a party at her dorm tonight.So what? She's fucking cute. Let her touch your penis. They exit the front door of the building...Dude, forget about those pricks. Let's just go. They continue walking...Jesus, that took forever. You know the purpose of a car is to avoid walking. And what kind of parking job is this? You're like a mile away from the curb.Just fucking with you. Now let's go out and get those burgers. I'm fucking starving! They get in the car and slam the door. The engine starts and the car takes off, revealing that they were parked next to aHey, Rold-- do you think C3PO is gay?Dude, give me thirty-five cents. HAROLD sorts through some change in his hand and gives Kumar the money. KUMAR tosses the change into the basket and waits for the TOLL BOOTH STOPLIGHT to turn green. It doesn't.What's going on? It didn't register. Dude, give me thirty-five more cents.Should I just go through?I can see that. A CAR HONKS BEHIND THEM. Kumar turns around and sees a number of cars lining up behind them. Right behind them, A BIG BURLY GUY leans his head out of a car...I'm going through.What the fuck is wrong with you?!No they're not!What?That was the last of our weed.Now we're in Newark of all places. You know we're gonna get shot.We have to if we want to get out of here. Kumar points to a sign indicating that the HIGHWAY is ahead.Come on. How do you know they're not peaceful Gregory Hines-like black guys? With that, the HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN OF ALL TIME ROARS AS HE COMPLETES A MONSTER DUNK. In celebration, he violently bumps chests with his teammates.Why? Are cars not allowed to go through when a game's going on? When we were kids, we used to move to the side when we were playing in the street. The HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN stares HAROLD and KUMAR down.I'm going through. KUMAR begins inching forward.Look. They're moving. I told you. Even though the Players are making way for Harold and Kumar, they're still no more than a foot or two from the car at all times. Harold is scared shitless. He then notices the HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN holding the basketball.How do you know?Oh fuck. KUMAR puts the pedal to the metal and ZOOMS AWAY FROM THEM.Rold, check it out! We're almost there!Well, prepare to gorge yourself.I'll see your twenty and raise you five orders of fries.Don't worry, we'll find it. HAROLD sees a HIGH SCHOOL up ahead...That means the White Castle should be just around the corner...We gotta get to the bottom of this!What happened to the White Castle?There used to be a White Castle right in this spot. Where is it?Please tell me there's another White Castle in town.Shit. What are we gonna do?Do you really think that'll satisfy us? The BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE senses their desperation.I can make the trip if you're willing to.Forget about the med school interview. It's a non-issue.You can always do your work in the car. HAROLD thinks for a moment, then licks his lips.Then it's settled. No matter what, we're not ending this night without White Castle in our stomachs. Agreed? KUMAR puts his hand out. HAROLD shakes it.White Castle, here we come. I just wish we had some more pot. I'm almost completely sober right now. HAROLD ignores this. He's TYPING FEVERISHLY ON HIS LAPTOP-- trying to get his work done. Meanwhile, Kumar notices a sign on for the PRINCETON EXIT.Nice. Princeton. We're getting off here. Kumar takes the exit.We're gonna sweet talk Cindy Kim into finding us some weed.Why the fuck not? You talk to her on the phone all the time.A twinkie?Look you twinkie bitch, you threw our weed out the window, so now it's your duty to make sure we're high as shit by the time we're eating those burgers.As long as she buzzes us into a dorm, we're set. Give me ten minutes in there and I guarantee I'll find some hizzy.Hey! You know where I can get some chronic? The RANDOM STUDENT doesn't respond. Kumar is frustrated...What kind of Ivy League school is this?Thank Christ! Look, just give me a dime of your finest herb. The Hippie Asshole opens his backpack. Inside, Kumar sees A GIANT PLASTIC BAG FILLED WITH WEED. He's awestruck...Oh my dear sweet lord... Kumar reaches for the weed, but the Hippie Asshole knocks his hand away...Eighty bucks?! It's worth forty tops, bro! The Hippie Asshole grabs the baggy back from Kumar.Jesus, what the hell kind of hippie are you?Please. Like they want to go listen to a bunch of Phish records while you read your lame ass poetry.109. Got it. I'll see you later.Rold! Rold! You gotta come quick! There are these two filthy pussies who are just aching to get boned by us. KUMAR notices that CINDY is appalled by his choice of words.Uh...I mean...there are two very lovely, young pussies who would like to have a chat with you and I.That's bullshit. He's coming with me. Isn't that right, Rold? CINDY gives HAROLD an evil eye-- he's intimidated by her.Fuck that! KUMAR notices an open dorm room nearby. He enters the room, and returns a few moments later dragging an ASIAN FRESHMAN in his pajamas. He pushes the Asian Freshman over to Cindy...Here-- this is Harold's understudy. You can do whatever you want with him. Let's go. KUMAR grabs HAROLD by the arm and drags him away. CINDY looks pissed as she watches HAROLD being taken away from her.I can't believe you were gonna ditch me for the Joy Luck Club. You know what their parties are like.Just say \"no\"! That's all it takes. Now take a hit of this. Kumar hands Harold the joint...suddenly, a nearby door opens and a SECURITY GUARD enters the hall. He sees HAROLD and KUMAR with drugs.Quick. In here. The guys rush into the WOMEN'S BATHROOM.Dude, chill out. He's not gonna look for us in the women's bathroom. Harold and Kumar hear TWO FEMALE VOICES outside the bathroom.Shit! Get in that stall! There's a line of THREE BATHROOM STALLS on one wall. HAROLD RUNS INTO STALL NUMBER TWO . KUMAR sees the BATHROOM DOOR START TO OPEN. He also runs into STALL NUMBER TWO and shuts the door behind him. The guys struggle to STAND ON THE TOILET BOWL. Harold's laptop bag keeps smacking Kumar. CHRISTY and CLARISSA enter the bathroom. They're in mid-conversation.Dude, I'm starting to think you made a mistake by not going to this party... Harold gives him a dirty look. Then, suddenly, the SECURITY GUARD from before appears in the hallway with ANOTHERI can't believe it. We were this close to getting high and getting laid.Hey, the diarrhea twins would've had sex with us! And what about Cindy?! She was looking hot tonight! The fact that you're not into her just might make you gay!What? You'd rather have Maria? From Harold's reaction, it's clear he hit it on the head.Fine. Suddenly, KUMAR pulls the car over to the side of the road...Daddy needs to urinate. Harold rolls his eyes.Oh yes! Yes, that's nice.Excuse me...I'm sorry, I just have to ask you...why are you peeing here?Why did you decide to piss here right next to me? Why not that bush over there?Nobody was here when I chose this bush.I was just saying....No, I just... You know what? Forget about it. I'm not in the mood to get stabbed right now. The CREEPY GUY calms down. He and KUMAR silently urinate next to each other for about TEN SECONDS, until the Creepy Guy subtly looks at Kumar's package.Thanks.I'll be honest, I'm a little lost. But don't worry. Once we get on the highway, we'll be there soon.What's the big deal?Holy shit! HAROLD tries to pry the raccoon away from his neck. KUMAR tries to help him.How the hell did that get in here?Don't worry. He didn't even break your skin. You'll be fine.Ahh! Dude, get that fucking cancer raccoon away from me!!!Thank Christ! Kumar looks back onto the road, where HE SEES A PAIR OFGoldstein? HAROLD breathes a sigh of relief.What the hell are you guys doing here?Dude-- how were Katie Holmes' tits?Yeah.Nice.Well, if you have the yellow fever tonight, there's a rocking Asian party over at Princeton tonight.Dude, you don't have rabies! We're not going to the hospital.Great, let's get out of here. Just as Harold and Kumar walk down the hallway to the EXIT...Shit.Eat my balls, Saikat.Oh, come on, dad!You're right. I'm sorry. KUMAR gives HIS FATHER a hug. He even gives SAIKAT a hug.It won't happen again.Fuck that! Like I care what my dad thinks. I can't wait to see the look on his face when he finds out I skipped the interview tomorrow. He wants to cut me off? Fine! I don't need his money!I just needed to get my hands on these... KUMAR holds up SAIKAT and HIS FATHER'S SCAN CARDS.Two words-- medical marijuana. HAROLD shakes his head in disgust.Look, I'm telling you, they see an Indian and Asian guy wearing these and they'll just assume we're doctors. Then we walk right into the pharmacy and get the weed. Harold does not appear happy he's doing this.We're not gonna get caught. We're gonna get toasted and then we're gonna eat delicious White Castle-- just like we planned. All of a sudden, a hand grabs Kumar from behind. Freaked out, they turn around and see a MALE NURSE .He must think I'm Saikat. Don't worry. Leave the talking up to me. On the operating table is a PATIENT BLEEDING FROM HIS CHEST. He is conscious and appears to be in a lot of pain.What Dr. Lee is trying to say is that we need to sedate the patient first or else he could go into cardiac arrest. HAROLD looks at KUMAR confused and nervous.Hold on. What we should probably use is marijuana. That'll sufficiently sedate the patient for surgery.We don't have time for questions! We need marijuana now! Get as much of it as possible! Like a big bag of it! KUMAR shows the amount he wants with his hands.Shit. Suddenly, more blood squirts from the Patient's chest. Harold shouts in disgust, making the Patient more nervous...Very well. I guess we'll have to do this the old fashioned way. KUMAR puts a nitrous oxide mask over the Patient's face. Harold gives Kumar a look-- \"What the fuck are you doing?\"First, we need to clear his C-spine. I want stat x-rays of the chest and abdomen. Give me two large bore IVs and start a ringers lactate push. Nurse, we need 2 units of O neg on board. Using the surgical equipment, Kumar actually begins removing bullets from the bleeding patient!!! Harold can't believe what's going on. Suddenly, the Patient begins having trouble breathing! He's gasping for air! The BEEPING SOUND monitoring his heart rate begins speeding up to an insane pace.Ah, I see. The Patient's got a collapsed lung. Get me a 14-gage Angiocath, stat! After a couple seconds go by...What's taking so long?Will one of you guys put the chest tube in and wrap this up? A chorus of \"yes, doctors.\"Well, it looks like my work here is done. Kumar pulls the gas mask from the patient's face up to his face and takes a deep breath, getting a big hit of nitrous. He then leans down to the BLEEDING PATIENT, who is just barely conscious -- but seems in good spirits...Say, you wouldn't happen to know the quickest way to get to the White Castle in Cherry Hill from here, do you?Yeah. It wasn't bad.Hey, check it out! Your movie's playing. Outside, to Kumar's left, on the marquee of a movie theater we see: \"JOHN HUGHES RETROSPECTIVE. CURLY SUE - 9:00.And look who went to see it... Harold looks at the crowd leaving the theater and sees MARIA standing outside, all by herself. He can't believe it.You see? You thought you two had nothing in common. But it turns out you both have the same lame taste in movies. Hey, you wanna see if she wants to come with us to White Castle?Harold. It's one in the morning. We're an hour from home. And who do we see, but your dream girl standing outside a theater playing your favorite movie. I mean, if we were in a cheesy romantic comedy, and I was your annoying gay friend, this would be the moment I'd tell you \"this is a sign.\"Come on. Just pretend you're a nerdy Asian Tom Hanks and she's a hot Latina Meg Ryan...with bigger tits. Besides, you yourself said things are starting to go our way...Hey Maria! MARIA looks up. HAROLD QUICKLY DUCKS IN HIS SEAT. HE THENHey, get your hand off the gas! Kumar tries kicking Harold's hand off the gas. Just then,Oh shit! Harold's Infiniti HAS DRIVEN OFF THE ROAD AND IS SPEEDINGDon't blame me. You're the one who ran us off the road!Fine. KUMAR presses the gas. Suddenly, we hear a \"POP!\" Harold and Kumar look at each other-- angry and frustrated.Please. Only hicks and Italian guys know how to change a tire. Harold looks in his trunk for the spare. It's missing.I don't know.Oh yeah! Don't you remember that time we got baked and started throwing shit off that bridge to see if it would float?Oh shit. That's right. I was with Goldstein. We borrowed your car that day. My bad.I'm Kumar. This is Harold. Good to meet you, Mr...Freak Show.Eww-- check out those boils on his neck! HAROLD nudges him to be quiet. KUMAR looks back over at FREAK SHOW and sees that ONE OF THE BOILS IS PULSATING.Oh my God! You gotta look! One of them's actually pulsating!Now there's some sort of puss! It's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen!Don't worry, he can't hear anything. Not with all that crust in his ear. HAROLD gives KUMAR a hard elbow to the stomach. He then looks nervously at FREAK SHOW, who doesn't seem to have heard a thing. Harold seems relieved.Am I deaf or did he just say we can fuck his wife?But he did! It may have been in mid- sentence, but it was still clear as day. They reach the front door and are about to enter...Dude, Liane is fucking hot!Thanks. So, tell me Liane-- how are things between you and Freak Show presently?Rock, paper, scissors to see who goes first?I'm not sure we quite understand...Um, are we talking about one hole or two?Shh! Two holes it might not be that bad. Shotgun anus!What about blow jobs?! Can we get blow jobs!?No. You did. We both heard you.Positive. FREAK SHOW ponders this.No problem.Okay, let's agree never to talk about what just happened.Dude, I have no idea where we are. All of a sudden, A HITCHHIKER waves them down up ahead.Hey, a hitchhiker. Should we pick him up?Oh, calm down. We're lost. He may know how to get us back on the highway.Holy shit, dude! Doogie Howser, M.D. was my favorite TV show growing up! You were my idol!So, Neil, I have to ask you-- did you ever get it on with Wanda off the set?Even the chick who played the hot nurse?Well, our night's been pretty crazy too. We've been driving around for hours, trying to get to White Castle, but we keep getting sidetracked.You don't understand, Neil. We've been craving these burgers all night.Hey, there's a gas station! Let's stop and get directions. KUMAR quickly makes a turn onto a NORMAL-LOOKING STREET leading up to a gas station in the distance...I don't know. But we can't let him interfere with our quest. Suddenly, Cole's Yellow Jeep drives right by them. They have to jump out of the way. Cole parks the jeep and exits withHe probably can't speak English...Who knew that learning Hindi would actually pay off? The guy says the highway's just down the road. We should be in Cherry Hill in ten minutes. HAROLD is still focused on COLE and the EXTREME PUNKS...Hey asshole! Why don't you leave the guy alone and go jerk off to some snowboarding videos or something.Shit. Cole and the Punks burst out laughing.Come on, lets get out of here. Harold and Kumar walk out of the store, deflated. With their leader victorious, the Punks begin celebrating.Yeah, I just hate those dicks. Fuck it. At least now we know where we're going. I'm so friggin' hungry...I think he did.Rold, calm down!I figured that Neil Patrick Harris was a trustworthy guy. How was I supposed to know that he'd fuck us over?Where are you going?There's a pay phone across the street, if you don't want to deal with those assholes.So after you talk to the cops we're still going to White Castle, right?You know, pressing the button a bunch of times doesn't make the sign change any faster. The computer responds to the first press. Every press after that is extraneous.This is ridiculous. Just walk across.Come on, there's not a car in sight!Finally.A ticket?! Are you serious? Harold motions Kumar to \"shut the fuck up!\"Wait. Hold on.Bust my ass?!220 dollars!? Are you crazy? Palumbo quickly turns around and returns to the guys.No, no, no. I understand what's going on.Let me guess. You were probably the big asshole in your high school, right? You'd pick on guys like us every day. But then graduation came, and we went to college and you went nowhere, so you thought, \"How can I still give them shit? I know! I'll become a cop!\" Well, congratulations. Your dream's come true. Both Officer Palumbo and Harold are getting really pissed. Kumar steps in front of Harold and offers his friend over to Palumbo.Hey, while you're at it, why don't you write him up another ticket? Or better yet, arrest him. Lock him up! With that, HAROLD TAKES A BIG SWING AT KUMAR. Kumar sees Harold's fist coming and quickly ducks. Harold's fist ends up hitting OFFICER PALUMBO in the face. SMACK!!!Rold? Is that you?Are the cops still there?I called and made up some story about a shooting in Millbrook park...I'm fucking starving! I figured I'd bust you out, and we'd get over to White Castle.Hey, fuck you! What did you want me to do? Stand there and take the hit? You know, I've never taken a swing at you before. Never.Look, Rold, I'm sorry. But you're not the only one dealing with shit. My dad's cutting me off, remember?You don't want my help? Fine! I'm outta here!Uh...Rold? How do I get out of here? Tarik rolls his eyes in disbelief.This isn't good. We hear the banging noise again. And again. Suddenly, THEOw...my ass. Kumar gets up and walks over to the cell.You sure you don't want to get out?So what? We'll take everything he wrote down about you and leave. Unless you want to stay here all night and not be able to hand your work in tomorrow. Harold thinks about this for a second.Yes! I was hoping it would be one of these big ring of keys. Now I get to try all of them to see which one will...What's that smell? Kumar turns his head and sees the ENORMOUS BAG OF WEED on Officer Reilly's desk.Hurry up!Hey, man, the burgers wouldn't taste as good if you weren't there. Dude, look at this. It's like we went from being broke to being millionaires. Suddenly, they hear what sounds like A COYOTE'S HOWL.Just a coyote. Don't worry.That's only because they sound scary. In one on one combat, either one of us can take a coyote down.Now cheetahs, they're another story. The CHEETAH stares HAROLD and KUMAR down.Just calm down. Cheetahs are used to eating zebras and shit. They're not known for eating humans.Okay, I'll admit, that's not a good sign. But I'm sure if we just stay calm he'll probably leave us alone. HAROLD and KUMAR stand silently. SLOWLY, the CHEETAH begins walking directly over to HAROLD...Shhh. Suddenly, the CHEETAH OPENS HIS MOUTH WIDE AND CHOMPS DOWN ONI thought I told you not to take that jerky! HAROLD simply falls to the ground relieved that he hasn't been eaten. The Cheetah walks over to Harold and begins licking Harold's face in friendship.Dude, I think I have an idea.I'll tell you, but first we have to get really high. Kumar opens the bag of weed. Pan up to the night sky for a time lapse. We see smoke coming up from below. Pan back down...Hey, cheetahs are the fastest animals on the planet. It's as good as a car. Kumar takes one last drag of a joint and flicks it away.Well, we'll soon find out. Mush! Mush!Both!I'm sorry! You've been out cold for the past half-hour! I figured that maybe if I did some gay shit you'd wake up. HAROLD wipes his face with his sleeve. He then gets up-- he sees that they are by a random road, all by themselves.It ran away. But forget about that. I have some bad news and some worse news.I checked out some road signs. The cheetah took us in the wrong direction.Your laptop is completely destroyed. Kumar points to the laptop, which is outside of it's bag, broken in pieces.It smashed against a tree when you fell off the cheetah.Well, the laptop really only effects you. Whereas the White Castle situation effects both of us equally.Don't worry, dude. Your laptop's insured.Exactly. First, we'll take a cab over to White Castle, then we'll...Come on, Rold! You can get that shit done in a couple hours. We can't quit now!Fine...We'll find a pay phone and get a cab back to your office. Harold, furious and almost in tears, simply nods \"yes.\"Look, there's a Krispee Kreme. We'll call from there.Oh great. Here we go again. COLE and the EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS are hacky-sacking in the parking lot. Their skateboards are sitting nearby.Fucking asshole. Suddenly, HAROLD stops in his tracks. He's noticed something through the Krispee Kreme window. He stops KUMAR and points...What? A chocolate cream filled?Are you saying what I think you're saying?Yes! I knew you had it in you! Suddenly, Kumar notices something else inside. Someone else is sitting down at Rosenberg & Goldstein's table...Is that Cindy Kim? Harold watches as Cindy Kim sits down next to Goldstein. Goldstein puts his arm around her and feeds her a piece of donut. It looks like Goldstein and Cindy are \"an item.\"You should have boned her when you had the chance. Before Harold can respond, he's hit in the back of the head by a hacky sack! Cole and the Punks laugh at Harold.Fuck! I'm so sick of their bullshit!Your lead? Harold walks past the Krispee Kreme entrance and heads towards the YELLOW JEEP at a brisk pace. KUMAR follows.What the hell are you doing?!This is your plan?Hey, slow down to like 25 mph, so they think they have a chance to catch up.Thank you, come again! Harold guns it-- leaving Cole and the Punks in the dust.Victory is sweet! Nice job, Roldy!Wait. Do you smell that? KUMAR keeps sniffing. He turns around to the back seat. He reaches back and picks something up from off the floor. It's a WHITE CASTLE bag. He pours out the contents and we see EMPTY WHITE CASTLE HAMBURGER CARTONS fall onto Kumar's lap.Those assholes got to have White Castle?!Don't worry . Forget about that. We have a car now. We're back in the game. Pretty soon we'll be eating our own White Castle. Want me to drive?Those guys are fucking posers!Dude, we're almost there!Oh shit! KUMAR turns around and sees the police car behind them.What are you doing?!Buckle up? Kumar buckles his seat belt. HAROLD MAKES A SHARP TURN...Where the hell are we going?!It's a good thing I have an empty stomach, or else I'd puke right now!Rold! Look out there!Not necessarily. KUMAR walks over to the JEEP and points to the HANG-GLIDER...Dude, it's okay. I used to hang-glide with my dad all the time when I was kid. I know how to do it.We did it on our trips to India. I swear. I know exactly what I'm doing. I've even done it with two people at the same time. My brother and I did it.You think this just about the burgers, huh? Well, let me tell you-- it's about far more than that. KUMAR walks over to the edge of the cliff and looks out onto the EARLY MORNING HORIZON. The sun is still rising. The scene is very picturesque...Our parents came to this country, escaping persecution, poverty, and hunger. Hunger, Harold. They were very, very hungry. And they wanted to live in a land that treated them as equals. A land where their kids could study and get into good colleges. A land filled with hamburger stands. And not just one type of hamburger. Hundreds of types-- with different sizes, toppings, and condiments. That land was America.You think this is just about the burgers? No. This is about achieving what our parents set out for. This is about the pursuit of happiness. This is about the American dream. KUMAR walks over to HAROLD.And so we've reached this point. The point which all men eventually have to face. The point of no return. We can stay here, get arrested and end our hopes of ever going to White Castle. Or we can take the hang-glider and make our leap towards freedom. I leave the decision up to you. From the sound of the sirens, it seems that the police are getting closer. Harold turns back, facing Kumar...Grab onto the end of the bars and hold on tight. HAROLD does as he's told. They are both holding onto the bars .Okay. Here's how this is gonna work. On the count of three, we're gonna run to the edge of the cliff. When I say \"jump,\" launch yourself forward as if you were diving into a pool, got it?Don't worry-- everything's gonna be fine. Are you ready? HAROLD's too nervous to speak. KUMAR gets into position.Okay, here goes. One...two...three! HAROLD and KUMAR START RUNNING TOWARDS THE CLIFF.Good job, Rold! Keep running!Rold, there's something I gotta tell you. I've never hang-glided before.Dude, it's working!Hey, how else was I gonna convince you to jump off a cliff?We're not low. They continue gliding though the sky for a while...Yeah?Uh...well...I guess it's just gonna go down at some point.Why do you ask?Oh shit! HAROLD AND KUMAR FLY RIGHT INTO THE CROWS. Numerous birds collide with their faces...We're gonna die! We're gonna die!We're gonna live! Ha! Ha! We're gonna live! You see, Rold? That wasn't so bad.Stop...I...can't...breathe...Rold...Rold...look!We made it, dude.Same. Only make mine Diet Cokes.You don't have money?! Shit, I gave all mine to that asshole at Princeton! Fuck that hippie fuck! This can't be happening! We're so close and we're fucking broke!What are you doing here?Do you realize what we had to go through after you stole the car?Dude, we're here. Isn't it great?Hey, look! KUMAR points to a TV in the corner of the restaurant. On the screen we see A MORNING NEWS SHOW.Wait...let's do it together.It was the best meal of my life.Dude, you know what? I think I may actually go to my interview today.Yeah. You know, my whole life I've been afraid being just another nerdy Indian guy turned doctor. Well, tonight got me thinking...There are far worse things in the world than being tagged for having a natural ability in medicine... HAROLD pretends to be listening to KUMAR-- BUT HE IS MORE FOCUSED ON BILLY AND J.D., who get out of the car with their women and start walking towards the front door.Like having boils all over your face. Or dealing with the shit those black guys had to go through.Besides, I have to admit, it felt pretty cool saving that guy's life last night. Somewhere between that, getting yelled at by my dad, and seeing Neil Patrick Harris, I realized that I've always wanted to be a doctor-- I've just been too scared to admit it. KUMAR sees that HAROLD isn't paying attention...Hey, Rold, are you listening to me? I'm having a major epiphany here.Way to go, Rold! Where the hell did that come from?No shit! I guess you're worthwhile after all.So those dudes have gonorrhea?What's the rush? There's plenty of time before my interview.Good luck, dude. KUMAR stands behind, while HAROLD approaches MARIA'S door.Dude...we gotta go!To Amsterdam! We can pack up right now and take the next plane.Whatever. I'll tell my dad to reschedule it. He won't have a problem, as long as I'm taking it seriously for a change. Now, let's fly to Europe and find Maria!For a hot chick, ten days in Europe is the kiss of death. There are gonna be suave, sophisticated guys all over her. By the time she gets back, she may not be available. Harold feels a little nervous about what Kumar is saying.Hey, Rold! Wait!You do realize what's legal in Amsterdam, right?", "clean_line": "mononucleosis mono infection caused epstein barr virus symptoms include fever sore throat headaches white patches throat swollen
