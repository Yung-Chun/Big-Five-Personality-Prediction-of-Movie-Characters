{"Lincoln": {"LINCOLN": {"raw_line": "What's your name, soldier?How long've you been a soldier?Second Kansas Colored Infantry, they fought bravely at Jenkins' Ferry.I am aware of it, Corporal Clark.What'll you do after the war, Corporal Clark?Perhaps I will.I've yet to find a man could cut mine so it'd make any difference.Yes, I do. My last barber hanged himself. And the one before that. Left me his scissors in his will.Could you hear what I said?That's good, thank you for -Thank you, that's -(to the two whiteGod bless you.It's nighttime. The ship's moved by some terrible power, at a terrific speed.Though it's imperceptible in the darkness, I have an intuition that we're headed towards a shore. No one else seems to be aboard the vessel. I'm alone.I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space...were it not that I have bad dreams. I reckon it's the speed that's strange to me. I'm used to going a deliberate pace.I should spare you. I shouldn't tell you my dreams.(rapping lightly on hisI do.It was most probably an -How's the plans for the big shindy progressing?Not much but they're a necessary -Don't spend too much money on the flubdubs.It's late, Mrs. Keckley.Good night.Hmm?Me too, Taddie. But we can't.Willie's gone. Three years now. He's gone.The part assigned to me is to raise the flag, which, if there be no fault in the machinery, I will do, and when up, it will be for the people to keep it up.That's my speech.Only twenty.We can find twenty votes.To which I always listen.With all three of my ears.Ain't won yit.I like our chances now.Fifty-six.Since the House last voted on the amendment there's been an election. Sixty-four Democrats lost their House seats in November. That's sixty-four Democrats looking for work come March.I said nothing of buying anything. We need twenty votes was all I said. Start of my second term, plenty of positions to fill.Mr. Jolly. Ma'am. This by the fire's Secretary of State Seward.Jeff City.I heard tell once of a Jefferson City lawyer who had a parrot that'd wake him each morning crying out, \"Today is the day the world shall end, as scripture has foretold.\" And one day the lawyer shot him for the sake of peace and quiet, I presume, thus fulfilling, for the bird at least, its prophecy!That's unnecessary, Mrs. Jolly. Just tell me what you want from me.Jeff City? That's, uh, Congressman Burton?Republican. Undecided on the question of the amendment, I believe. Perhaps you could call on him and inform him of your enthusiasm.Would you let me study this letter, sir, about the tollbooth? Come back to me in the morning and we'll consider what the law says.And be sure to visit \"Beanpole\" and tell him that you support passage of the Amendment. As a military necessity.Oh, Nicolay? When you have a moment.Pardon me, that's a distress signal, which I am bound by solemn oath to respond to.You had nightmares all night, mama's right to -Perhaps.Send over to Blair House. Ask Preston Blair can I call on him around five o'clock.If the Blairs tell `em to, no Republican will balk at voting for the amendment.Yes, sir, I do.He spends his days with soldiers.Thunder forth, God of War!It got took by a breeze several nights back.Old Neptune! Shake thy hoary locks!Wilmington's their last open seaport. Therefore...I don't recall Bates being any too certain about the legality of my Proclamation, just it wasn't downright criminal. Somewhere's in between. Back when I rode the legal circuit in Illinois I defended a woman from Metamora named Melissa Goings, 77 years old, they said she murdered her husband; he was 83. He was choking her; and, uh, she grabbed ahold of a stick of fire-No one was keen to see her convicted, he was that kind of husband. I asked the prosecuting attorney if I might have a short conference with my client. And she and I went into a room in the courthouse, but I alone emerged. The window in the room was found to be wide open. It was believed the old lady may have climbed out of it. I told the bailiff right before I left her in the room she asked me where she could get a good drink of water, and I told her Tennessee. Mrs. Goings was seen no more in Metamora. Enough justice had been done; they even forgave the bondsman her bail.I decided that the Constitution gives me war powers, but no one knows just exactly what those powers are. Some say they don't exist. I don't know. I decided I needed them to exist to uphold my oath to protect the Constitution, which I decided meant that I could take the rebels' slaves from `em as property confiscated in war. That might recommend to suspicion that I agree with the rebs that their slaves are property in the first place. Of course I don't, never have, I'm glad to see any man free, and if calling a man property, or war contraband, does the trick... Why I caught at the opportunity. Now here's where it gets truly slippery. I use the law allowing for the seizure of property in a war knowing it applies only to the property of governments andTwo years ago I proclaimed these people emancipated - \"then, thenceforward and forever free.\" But let's say the courts decide I had no authority to do it. They might well decide that. Say there's no amendment abolishing slavery. Say it's after the war, and I can no longer use my war powers to just ignore the courts' decisions, like I sometimes felt I had to do. Might those people I freed be ordered back into slavery? That's why I'd like to get the Thirteenth Amendment through the House, and onAs the preacher said, I could write shorter sermons but once I start I get too lazy to stop.Well, the people do that, I suppose. I signed the Emancipation Proclamation a year and half before my second election. I felt I was within my power to do it; however I also felt that I might be wrong about that; I knew the people would tell me. I gave `em a year and half to think about it. And they re- elected me. And come February the first, I intend to sign the Thirteenth Amendment.Well, Mr. Representative Ashley! Tell us the news from the Hill.Why for instance is this thus, and what is the reason for this thusness?We're whalers, Mr. Ashley!We've been chasing this whale for a long time. We've finally placed a harpoon in the monster's back. It's in, James, it's in! We finish the deed now, we can't wait! Or with one flop of his tail he'll smash the boat and send us all to eternity!I intend to, Preston. And in return, I must ask you -Not now!Oh. Bob. I'm sorry. Welcome home.(dismissing Robert,I understand, Preston.Six.What'd Hawkins get?He's selling himself cheap, ain't he?Time for my public opinion bath. Might as well let `em in.Seven yeses with Mr. Ellis! Thirteen to go!We'll hear `em out.The Blairs have promised support for the amendment if we listen to these people -What hope for any Democratic votes, Willum, if word gets out that I've refused a chance to end the war? You think word won't get out? In Washington?\"If you can look into the seeds of time, And say which grain will grow and which will not, Speak then to me...\"Time is a great thickener of things, Willum.Get me thirteen votes.

We'll return them to Mr. Gardner's studio day after next. Be careful with `em, now. These things should've stayed on the calf.I know.Somehow you will.We didn't know how sick he was.Three years ago, the war was going so badly, and we had to put on a face.Molly. It's too hard. Too hard.Since we have the floor next in the debate, I thought I'd suggest you might...temper your contributions so as not to frighten our conservative friends?I can't ensure a single damn thing if you scare the whole House with talk of land appropriations and revolutionary tribunals and punitive thisses and thats -That's the untempered version of reconstruction. It's not... It's not exactly what I intend, but we shall oppose one another in the course of time. Now we're working together, and I'm asking you -When the people disagree, bringing them together requires going slow till they're ready to make up -I admire your zeal, Mr. Stevens, and I have tried to profit from the example of it. But if I'd listened to you, I'd've declared every slave free the minute the first shell struck Fort Sumter; then the border states would've gone over to the confederacy, the war would've been lost and the Union along with it, and instead of abolishing slavery, as we hope to do, in two weeks, we'd be watching helpless as infants as it spread from the American South into South America.A compass, I learnt when I was surveying, it'll - it'll point you True North from where you're standing, but it's got no adviceRobert's going to plead with us to let him enlist.Tad's young.Plenty of boys younger than Robert signing up...\"Come on out, you old rat!\"That's what Ethan Allen called to the commander of Fort Ticonderoga in 1776. \"Come on out, you old rat!\" `Course there were only forty- odd redcoats at Ticonderoga. But, but there is one Ethan Allen story that I'm very partial to -It was right after the Revolution, right after peace had been concluded, and Ethan Allen went to London to help our new country conduct its business with the king. The English sneered at how rough we are, and rude and simple-minded and on like that, everywhere he went, till one day he was invited to the townhouse of a great English lord. Dinner was served, beverages imbibed, time passed, as happens, and Mr. Allen found he needed theNow, Mr. Allen discovered on entering the water closet that the only decoration therein was a portrait of George Washington. Ethan Allen done what he came to do and returned to the drawing room. His host and the others were disappointed when he didn't mention Washington's portrait. And finally His Lordship couldn't resist, and asked Mr. Allen had he noticed it, the picture of Washington. He had. Well, what did he think of its placement, did it seem appropriately located to Mr. Allen? Mr. Allen said it did. His host was astounded! Appropriate? George Washington's likeness in a water closet? Yes, said Mr. Allen, where it'll do good service: the whole world knows nothing'll make an Englishman shit quicker than the sight of George Washington.I love that story.After four years of war and near 600,000 lives lost. He believes we can end this war now. My trust in him is marrow deep.Now, here's a sixteen year old boy. They're going to hang him...(he reads a littleIt's three forty in the morning.He oughtn't to have done that, crippled his horse, that was cruel, but you don't just hang a sixteen year old boy for that -- for cruelty. There'd be no sixteen year old boys left. Grant wants me to bring the secesh delegates to Washington.He was afraid, that's all it was. I don't care to hang a boy for being frightened, either. What good would it do him?War's nearly done. Ain't that so? What use one more corpse? Any more corpses?Times like this, I'm best alone.\"Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant, City Point. I have read your words with interest.\"\"I ask that, regardless of any action I take in the matter of the visit of the Richmond commissioners, you maintain among your troops military preparedness for battle, as you have done until now.\"\"Have Captain Saunders convey the commissioners to me here in Washington.\" \"A. Lincoln.\" And the date.You think we choose to be born?Are we fitted to the times we're born into?What do you reckon?You're an engineer, you must know Euclid's axioms and common notions.I never had much of schooling, but I read Euclid, in an old book I borrowed. Little enough ever found its way in here - - but once learnt it stayed learnt.That's a rule of mathematical reasoning. It's true because it works; has done and always will do. In his book, Euclid says this is \"self-evident.\" D'you see? There it is, even in that two-thousand year old book of mechanical law: it is a self- evident truth that things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other. We begin with equality. That's the origin, isn't it? That balance, that's fairness, that's justice.Read me the last sentence of my telegram.A slight emendation, Sam, if you would.\"Have Captain Saunders convey the gentlemen aboard the River Queen as far as Hampton Roads, Virginia, and there wait until...\" \"...further advice from me. Do not proceed to Washington.\"You said you wanted to help me.She told me she didn't take you inside.At all rates, I'm happy to have your company.Morning, Jim.Good to see you again.Well, boys, first question: You getting enough to eat?What's your name, soldier?Robert. Good to meet you, Robert.What's your name?Tell me your names as I go past. I like to know who I'm talkin' to. Kevin.John. I've seen you before.What's the matter, Bob?That same speech has been made by how many sons to how many fathers since the war began? \"I don't need your damn permission, you miserable old goat, I'm gonna enlist anyhow!\" And what wouldn't those numberless fathers have given to be able to say to their sons - as I now say to mine - \"I'm commander-in-chief, so in point of fact, without my permission, you ain't enlisting in nothing, nowhere, young man.\"We can't lose you.He'll be fine, Molly. City Point's far from the front lines, from the fighting, he'll be an adjutant running messages for General Grant.That's not true -Just, just this once, Mrs. Lincoln, I demand of you to try and take the liberal and not the selfish point of view! You imagine Robert will forgive us if we continue to stifle his very natural ambition?!I couldn't tolerate you grieving so for Willie because I couldn't permit it in myself, though I wanted to, Mary. I wanted to crawl under the earth, into the vault with his coffin. I still do. Every day I do. Don't... talk to me about grief. I must make my decisions, Bob must make his, you yours. And bear what we must, hold and carry what we must. What I carry within me - you must allow me to do it, alone as I must. And you alone, Mary, you alone may lighten this burden, or render it intolerable. As you choose.Seward doesn't want me leaving big muddy footprints all over town.I don't envy him his task. He may wish He'd chosen an instrument for His purpose more wieldy than the House of Representatives.Are you afraid of what lies ahead? For your people? If we succeed?Many don't.I...I don't know you, Mrs. Keckley. Any of you. You're ...familiar to me, as all people are. Unaccommodated, poor, bare, forked creatures such as we all are. You have a right to expect what I expect, and likely our expectations are not incomprehensible to each other. I assume I'll get used to you. But what you are to the nation, what'll become of you once slavery's day is done, I don't know.I wouldn't bet against it, Mr...?Mr. Bilbo. Gentlemen.The Secretary of State here tells me that, uh, you got eleven Democrats in the bag. That's encouraging.\"We have heard the chimes of midnight, Master Shallow.\" I'm here to alert you boys that the great day of reckoning is nigh upon us.Mm-hmm. Do me a favor, willya?Snagged my eye in the paper this morning. Governor Curtin is set to declare a winner in the disputed Congressional election for the -What a joy to be comprehended. Hop on a train to Philadell, call on the Governor -No, he'll do fine, just polish yourself up first.That's him.Now give me the names of whoever else you been hunting.I got it.I saw a barge once, Mr. Yeaman, filled with colored men in chains, heading down the Mississippi to the New Orleans slave markets. It sickened me, `n more than that, it brought a shadow down, a pall around my eyes. Slavery troubled me, as long as I can remember, in a way it never troubled my father, though he hated it. In his own fashion. He knew no smallholding dirt farmer could compete with slave plantations. He took us out from Kentucky to get away from `em. He wanted Indiana kept free. He wasn't a kind man, but there was a rough moral urge for fairness, for freedom in him. I learnt that from him, I suppose, if little else from him. We didn't care for one another, Mr. Yeaman.Lovingkindness, that most ordinary thing, came to me from other sources. I'm grateful for that.We're unready for peace too, ain't we? When it comes, it'll present us with conundrums and dangers greater than any we've faced during the war, bloody as it's been. We'll have to extemporize and experiment with what it is when it is.I read your speech, George. Negroes and the vote, that's a puzzle.I'm asking only that you disenthrall yourself from the slave powers. I'll let you know when there's an offer on my desk for surrender. There's none before us now. What's before us now, that's the vote on the Thirteenth Amendment. It's going to be so very close. You see what you can do.I'd change that in you if I could, but that's not why I come. I might be wrong, Mr. Hutton, but I expect... Colored people will most likely be free, and when that's so, it's simple truth that your brother's bravery, and his death, helped make it so. Only you can decide whether that's sense enough for you, or not.My deepest sympathies to your family.I can't listen to this anymore! I can't accomplish a goddamned thing of any human meaning or worth until we cure ourselves of slavery and end this pestilential war, and whether any of you or anyone else knows it, I know I need this! This amendment is that cure! We're stepped out upon the world's stage now, now, with the fate of human dignity in our hands! Blood's been spilt to afford us this moment!Now now now! And you grousle and heckle and dodge about like pettifogging Tammany Hall hucksters! See what is before you! See the here and now! That's the hardest thing, the only thing that accounts! Abolishing slavery by constitutional provision settles the fate, for all coming time, not only of the millions now in bondage but of unborn millions to come. Two votes stand in its way, and these votes must be procured.You got a night and a day and a night and several perfectly good hours! Now get the hell out of here and get `em!Buzzards' guts, man.I am the President of the United States of America, clothed in immense power! You will procure me these votes.This is precisely what Mr. Wood wishes me to respond to?Word for word? This is precisely the assurance that he demands of me?Give this to Mr. Ashley.Impeachable. I've made no false representation.Give me the note, Johnnie.Please deliver that to Mr. Ashley.I'd like peace immediately.I'd like your states restored to their practical relations to the Union immediately.We ain't here to discuss reconstruction, we have no legal basis for that discussion. But I don't want to deal falsely. The Northern states'll ratify, most of `em. As I figure, it remains for two of the Southern states to do the same, even after all are readmitted. And I been working on that.Arkansas too, most likely. It'll be ratified. Slavery, sir, it's done.If we submit ourselves to law, Alex, even submit to losing freedoms - the freedom to oppress, for instance - we may discover other freedoms previously unknown to us. Had you kept faith with democratic process, as frustrating as that can be -It may be you're right. But say all we done is show the world that democracy isn't chaos, that there is a great invisible strength in a people's union? Say we've shown that a people can endure awful sacrifice and yet cohere? Mightn't that save at least the idea of democracy, to aspire to? Eventually, to become worthy of? At all rates, whatever may be proven by blood and sacrifice must've been proved by now. Shall we stop this bleeding?Once he surrenders, send his boys back to their homes, their farms, their shops.Liberality all around. No punishment. I don't want that. And the leaders - Jeff and the rest of `em - if they escape, leave the country while my back's turned, that wouldn't upset me none.Some weariness has bit at my bones. I never seen the like of it before. What I seen today. Never seen the like of it before.We've made it possible for one another to do terrible things.I'd like that. To the West by rail.The Holy Land.Jerusalem. Where David and Solomon walked. I dream of walking in that ancient city.Anyone thinks that doesn't understand, Molly.We must try to be happier. We must. Both of us. We've been so miserable for so long.I did say some colored men, the intelligent, the educated, and veterans, I qualified it.Still, I wish I'd mentioned it in a better speech.Am I in trouble?Thank you, Mr. Slade.I suppose it's time to go, though I would rather stay.Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said \"the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.\"With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and a lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.", "clean_line": "soldier long ve soldier second kansas colored infantry fought bravely jenkins ferry

I gather we are working together! The White House and the other House? Hatching little plans together?What?Oh! Oh, I'm detaining you, and more important, the people behind you! How the people love my husband, they flock to see him, by their thousands on public days! They will never love you the way they love him. How difficult it must be for you to know that.

Do it! Don't you threaten me, you do it this time! Lock me away! You'll have to, I swear, if Robert is killed!You think I'm ignorant of what you're up to because you haven't discussed this scheme with me as you ought to have done.
