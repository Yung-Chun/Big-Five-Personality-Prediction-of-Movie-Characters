{"ParaNorman": {"NORMAN": {"raw_line": "The zombie is eating her head, Grandma.Because he's a zombie. That's what they do.Coming, Dad!Sex and violence.I thought you said kids my age were too busy shoplifting and joyriding?Dad? Grandma says, \"Can you turn up the heating?\" Her feet are cold. The bubble Courtney is blowing POPS against her face, Perry rolls his eyes and GROANS, and Sandra pales.I know!Because she talks back!I'm not making this up! I swear! She talks to me all the time!She said it's not very ladylike to hide photos of the High School quarterback with his shirt off in your underwear drawer. Sandra and Perry raise their eyebrows.No I haven't! Grandma told me!No she's not, she's in the living room. Perry throws his arms in the air, swaying on the chair.Good morning! Hey Bruce! How's it goin'? Not much. I'm kind of late for school. I need to go. Hi, nice to see you guys. Good morning. Sorry I gotta run. Excuse me. Pardon me. See ya. At one street corner, Norman bends over a gutter. He is watched curiously by a man retrieving his morning paper across the other side of the street. MAN'S POV - Norman crouches over the flattened remains of raccoon road kill.Hey there little buddy! C'mere! He realizes he is being stared at and slowly turns to face the onlooker, then hurries away. Though no one else sees them, to Norman's eyes, a whole host of ghosts are meandering through the streets.Yeah, good to see you! How you doin'? Hi Mrs Hardman. You look nice today. I like what you've done with your hair.Totally.Sir, yes sir!No no, I'm just late for school. Sorry, I gotta go. How you doin'? ParaNorman 8.Hi! How's it hanging?What do you want, Alvin?Flies don't talk. Across the hall, Neil continues to watch with sympathy, but he is already being hurried along by his friend SALMA, a nerdy Indian kid with braces.The founding fathers of Blithe Hollow discovered an evil witch amongst them...Sorry, Mrs Henscher.I keep telling you, Neil. I like to be alone.Why?Doesn't it bother you? ParaNorman 14.Yes. I know. I was told not to talk to you. Sorry. Mr Prenderghast steps in front of Neil, leaning closer to Norman and whispering conspiratorially.Actually, we're learning about it in school..?He's my uncle.What? Norman just stares at him.Uh, yeah?Maybe.No. My grandma told me it's usually people who still have stuff to figure out. Or sometimes it's the ones who died suddenly, or in a bad way. A BARK, and Norman turns to see a translucent puppy wagging its tail cheerfully, despite being chopped neatly into two halves.Bub?Uh... good. Bub bounds over to Neil, runs clean through his chubby calves, then doubles back for another try.He's happy to see you.Yeah, I guess. Neil bends over and kisses the air by his ankles, making a \"coochy-coo\" face.Uh... that's not his chin. Neil stops mid-smooch, and quickly stands up. Norman watches as Neil picks up a stick and waves it in front of Bub's nose, even though he can't see him.He can't fetch it, y'know. ParaNorman 19.`Cos I don't really, uh... You can go.No I don't want to.No it's okay. You can throw it.Here. You go first.Okay, what do I do?Neil? Sorry! As Norman runs over to him, Neil lies on his back GIGGLING, the stick held between his teeth.Are you okay? CUT WIDE as the two kids enjoy their play, the sun above them breaking through the clouds in a bright blue sky.Oh no! Not again! All around trees have sprouted out of nowhere, and through the darkness in the distance are occasional lights of small houses. This might be how this very spot looked three centuries ago.No!The tree told me! ParaNorman 24.This is ridiculous. I wish everyone could see what I see! I didn't ask to be born this way! Perry mutters as he slams his door shut.He's my dad. He shouldn't be afraid of me. ParaNorman 25.You died?!Ew! Couldn't you use another stall?Me? No, you must have it wrong!But I... I don't know what any of it means! ParaNorman 27.But I'm just a kid! How am I supposed to stop it? In an instant the air and trees around him are eaten away, the school bathroom reappearing through the holes.What book?But this is crazy!Y-you mean like the \"f\" word?Okay, okay, I promise...No! Mr Prenderghast, wait! Alvin, hearing only Norman's voice, gingerly peeks around the corner of his stall.Wait! No, you can't leave now! Please! I don't understand. Mr Prenderghast hangs in the air a moment, face scrunched up as he awaits his release, CACKLING crazily. The ghost explodes into a million particles of light, blowing open the stall door and catapulting Alvin backwards across the room. The mirrors behind him crack and the light bulb shatters. From the floor, Alvin groggily looks up and sees Norman framed in the stall with the door hanging off its hinges. He reaches over and flushes the toilet.Uh... yeah. You might want to give that a few minutes. He grabs his bag and runs out of the room. ParaNorman 29.I've kinda got other things on my mind right now. Neil looks a little uncomfortable.Mr Prenderghast appeared to me in the bathroom!No, his spirit! He says the witch's curse is real and I have to go up to the old graveyard to stop it! Before the sun sets tonight! Neil shifts uneasily as he processes.Didn't you hear what I just said?!Just go home, Neil. I'm better off on my own anyway.Go home! Norman reaches up and closes the window. Neil's shoulders sag and he turns away. Across the room, his Grandma materializes, and squints her eyes through the window as Neil awkwardly pulls himself over the garden fence.No one. Norman isn't in the mood for any more discussion.Dad says I'm not supposed to talk to you any more, Grandma.So why did you stay?So it's your... duty?And you'd do it no matter what?Even if it was something really scary... Grandma eyes him curiously.Hello? Mr Prenderghast? Motes of dust float around Norman as he moves slowly toward a door, slightly ajar, muttering to himself. He quietly makes his way past all manner of objects that epitomize the state of Mr Prenderghast's mind; a mannequin in a shopping cart, a pile of broken typewriters, a suspended bag of spoons, a closet full of identically soiled hobo suits, a Nordic track...Let go! Norman spends several strenuous moments dragging the body across the floorboards, Mr Prenderghast's head glancing off table legs and smacking repeatedly against the floorboards, as Norman tries to wrestle the book free. With a final yank the book pulls loose and, GASPING, Norman grips the book to his chest and runs to the door.This is it! The sun continues its descent, casting an ever lengthening shadow of treetops across the graveyard.Read from the book, stop the curse, go home and pretend this never happened. Norman steels himself, opens the book and starts to read.\"Once upon a time, in a far-off land there lived a king and queen in a magnificent castle...\" He pauses, confused by what he's reading.What? A fairy... tale...? A hand reaches over his shoulder from nowhere, whipping the book out of his grasp. He spins around to find Alvin standing behind him.Give it back!No, don't! Alvin!Uh-oh.It's her! Another violent CRACK of thunder and flash of light, and the wind instantly cuts out. The boys stand stock still. Reaching down like a colossal arm, a great plume of cloud spirals over the cemetery, enveloping the tumbledown chapel and seeping around the gravestones. Fingers of murky fog slither across the ground, occasionally pausing and hanging in the air as though sniffing it. There is something eerily playful in the movement of the tendrils. The boys are jolted as an awful high pitched SCREAM blows through the graveyard like a shockwave, pulsing through the fog like a heartbeat. Norman and Alvin cover their ears and cower as the fog suddenly rears up like a claw and fiercely gouges into the earth in front of the boys. ParaNorman 37.Once upon a time in a far-off... Once upon a... In a...It's not working! The Dead Judge gives a hideous GROWL, but Norman frowns, confused, because he can hear words.Wait! Norman follows, leapfrogging over headstones.I think you'll be safe.I don't get it! Why didn't it work? He opens the book and leafs through page after page of ornate calligraphy and woodcut illustrations.\"The Story of Sleeping Beauty\". This doesn't make any sense! His mind racing, Norman heads off along the hallway.Mr Prenderghast, I don't understand! Tell me what to do!He told me to read from the book to stop the curse! I thought it was a spell or something, but... Norman narrows his eyes as he sees Mr Prenderghast's desk, still strewn with pictures and newspaper clippings. He hurries over and begins rummaging through the mess, scattering papers across the floor.Come on! There has to be something...Seven victims... Frowning, Norman glances up and sees a page from an old book tacked to the wall. It is an illustration of a hideous old crone, cackling evilly. Another THUMP from down the hall. Norman looks again from the photographs in his hand to the image of the old witch. There's something he's not seeing... He looks at the pictures in front of him. Graves. Jurors. Witch.Seven graves.I was reading the book in the wrong place! Down the hallway, another loud THUMP.Hide! ParaNorman 43.Come on!Run! The head in Mitch's hands suddenly GASPS again, opening its mouth. Mitch SHRIEKS as the headless figure on the road sits up and reaches out its arms. Mitch drop kicks it like a football. It flies, WAILING, into the bushes. ParaNorman 47.Uh, guys... maybe we should actually drive away now.Well, you weren't supposed to follow me, were you?You don't understand! I'm the only one who can stop this, Courtney!I'm supposed to read from the book at the witch's grave!She wasn't buried with the others. I don't know where else to look...Uh... yeah.Salma! We need to find out where the witch is buried! I went to the old graveyard but her grave wasn't there!Salma! Please! Hurry! Y'know, I would Google this myself if there wasn't a 300 year old dead guy trying to rip my face off! With a SIGH, Salma types at her computer.Quick! She said go to the Town Hall!Uh oh. C'mon!Hurry! This way! Norman leads the way, but stops dead as they run headlong into a scene of zombie invasion mayhem. Townsfolk fill the streets, SHOUTING and acting generally mob-like. One or two of them have even got hold of burning torches from somewhere. It's apocalyptic chaos. The fat woman from the Drive-Thru runs past SCREAMING, her face and T-shirt covered in blood-red ketchup.C'mon! They skirt around the edge of Main Street, avoiding flying bottles and limbs as best they can. Following the noise, the Judge staggers along some way behind. He surveys the scene as he emerges, his featureless face doing a nevertheless effective job of expressing horrified shock. After a moment, he comes to his senses, and spies the kids in the distance. A look of resolve crosses his face, turning quickly to surprise as a SHOT rings out nearby. The Judge looks down to a large hole blown through his midriff. Framed within it is Crystal, several feet away, rifle smoking. He looks up again, weighs up his chances, then lets out a ROAR of retreat to his beleaguered companions before running off into the shadows. Those zombies who haven't already tried to run for cover manage to extricate themselves from the frenzy and follow the Judge's CRY, some of them breaking into a sprint.Is everyone alright? Nobody got bitten? Neil flops down heavily against the statue, panting and holding his mouth.Does anyone know how to pick a lock? Everyone immediately looks at Alvin.This is it! ParaNorman 61.Now we can find out where the witch was buried! Norman pushes his shoulder against the door and steps inside.Uh-oh. Courtney follows, faking enthusiasm.Come on! No, that's not it. Time is running out!If I'd known there was so much reading involved, I would have brought a completely different group of people who hate me. Neil suddenly YELLS out victoriously. Everyone turns to him, hardly believing he might have found the answer. He waves a book triumphantly above his head and grins at everyone.Guys, come on!We have to keep trying! ParaNorman 66.You never listen! No one ever listens! I'm scared too, but I've still gotta do this.I should've known you wouldn't understand! No one ever does!Everyone in the real world thinks I'm a freak! And you know what, maybe they're right, maybe I am a freak! But I never asked for your help... just go! Get out! Courtney, Mitch and Alvin back off a half step as Norman advances on them.Hello? He turns around to face his friend and finds himself staring up at a zombie, moving toward him along the dark aisle, pale moonlight shining off its exposed bones. Norman GASPS. He realizes zombies are converging on him from all directions, barring his way out through the door. The Dead Judge GROANS as he approaches. Norman backs away, clutching the book to his chest. Out of the corner of his eye Norman spots another doorway in the shadows of the wall behind him and moves toward it, calling out desperately.Help! Somebody help me!You horrible old witch! Is this what you want? The roiling face above him seems to CACKLE mercilessly.Once upon a time in a far-off land there lived a king and queen... in a magnificent castle... The horrible cloud face above him CACKLES monstrously, drowning out the story.Why won't you listen to me? Why are you doing this?! The face in the clouds turns inside out as a tongue of lightning spits out. It SMACKS into the book held in front of Norman's chest, lifts him up off his feet and throws him back onto the old timbers of the roof. The air is knocked out of Norman as, trailing smoke, he SMASHES through the wood into the fiery chasm of the building beneath. ParaNorman 71.No! A young farmhand bows his head shamefully, as he adds further ammunition to the prosecution.Wait! No! You can't do this! The grim-faced Sheriff moves toward Norman and Aggie. She backs away, tears flowing down her face.How could you?! She was just a little kid! She was no different than me! The Dead Judge takes a step forward.Keep away from me! The Dead Judge stops, then opens his horrible mouth and speaks in a guttural voice. ParaNorman 74.What? You don't want to kill me? The Judge shakes his head and points down at the book beside Norman's feet.But it didn't work! It's a fairy tale! Just a bedtime... story... He narrows his eyes at the Judge.That's it, isn't it? A bedtime story to keep a little girl asleep for another year. And now you need my help because I'm the only one who can read it to her! He bends down to pick it up. His eyes flash angrily at the zombies and he hurls the burnt book at the Judge. It hits him in the chest and falls to his feet with a THUD.Here's your book! Try reading it yourself! The zombies stare down at the blackened lump of charred paper, and several of them GASP. The Dead Judge's eyes are filled with fear and desperation.Why did you do it?Of what?Every year someone reads the story at her grave. Before me it was Mr Prenderghast, and before him there were others, but the curse doesn't ever go away. Nothing gets better. It's not enough. Norman looks at it a moment, thinking. He knows what he has to do.Something nobody ever did before. I've gotta go talk to her.Come on! This way!Wait! Courtney and the other kids GASP as they watch from within the doorway.No! I won't! Sandra comes up behind her husband and holds his arm.No! You don't understand what's happening here! I spoke to them and it's not what you think! Courtney edges forward out of the doorway, shocked but transfixed.The curse isn't about the zombies hurting you! It's about you hurting them! I figured it out, and I know a way to stop this!Listen to me!No, does it look like any of them are trying to hurt you? They're just people. At least they used to be. Just stupid people who should have known better. Norman looks at the line of Puritans. They look quite sad and pathetic really. Hardly monstrous at all.They did something unforgivable because they were scared, and they were cursed for it. Now it's happening all over again. Don't you get it? They were just like you. But now it has to stop. For good. Across the crowd, weapons are being lowered and faces are starting to look a little guilty. There is silence as the modern townsfolk stare at the line of three hundred year-old townsfolk. Throughout the crowd various weapons CLATTER as they hit the ground. A small girl tiptoes up the steps and silently offers one of the zombies his arm back. The quiet is shattered by a deafening SCREAM. It blows out of the storm clouds and whips through the plaza on a hellish wind. The street lamps around the square shatter in bursts of sparks, raining down on the amassed people. The sky above is blood red, clouds twisting and contorting into a vast unnatural vortex. The Town Hall erupts in a fireball, tongues of white fire ROARING out of the embers as the ground shakes and the crowd scatters in terror. Neil turns to Norman as they duck for cover behind a parked car, and SHOUTS over the noise of the wind.I... I really don't know...But...I thought we did.Dad, could I borrow the car?She wants you to move over. The Judge MUMBLES.Can you quit using the \"z\" word?He says \"take a left here\". Perry gives a distasteful look, but turns the steering wheel. He peers out through the raging storm, windscreen wiper batting ineffectively at the onslaught of debris.Turn down there!Someone's gotta talk to her, Dad.Mom!I'm okay Mom! Wait for me here! Don't worry!Hello? Words echo around him in response.Uh... I really need to speak with you.I'm Norman. Norman Babcock. You don't actually know me, but I know you. We're actually kind of the same, you and I. Norman takes another step closer, ducking as petrified branches and rocks fly over his head on the wind. ParaNorman 85.Well, no, apart from that.Well, yes, that too.Well, I know how you feel?I know your name is Agatha Prenderghast. The ghostly voice wavers for the first time.And I know you're probably tired. Right? Because, I mean, it's really late and it's been a long night and we're, like, only eleven years-old, and... The voice snaps back like a clap of thunder.No. I'm not leaving. Just listen to me. Uh... once upon a time... long ago... there was a little girl... ParaNorman 86.A little girl who was different from the other people in her village. The voice chants petulantly over him as if putting its demonic fingers in its ears.She could see and do things that no one could understand, and that made them scared of her.She turned away from everyone, and became sad and lonely, and had no one to turn to.But the more she turned away from people, the more scared they were of her, and they did something terrible! Arcs of white energy CRACKLE through the air. Where they hit the ground, they send up white flames.They became so scared that they took her away and killed her!But even though she was dead something in her came back.And this part of her wouldn't go away, not for three hundred years...And the longer it stayed, the less there was of the little girl!Why? Aggie goes to shout, but stops, unsure of her answer.Because you want everyone to hurt just as much as you are! So whenever you wake up you play this mean game, but you don't play fair!So you hurt them back?You're just like them, Agatha.You're a bully.They did something awful, but that doesn't mean you should too!All that's left of you now is mean and horrible! He sees her clearly now. True, she is floating above the ground, and her hair is writhing madly about her, and plumes of spectral fire are pouring off her body, but she's still just a little girl underneath.Then stop. This is wrong and you know it! You've spent so long remembering the bad people that you've forgotten the good ones. There must have been someone who loved you and cared for you. You don't remember them?But you're not alone! You have to remember!Remember! There is a flash of white, and silence.Sometimes when people get scared they say and do terrible things. I think you got so scared, that you forgot who you are. But I don't think you're a witch. Not really. Aggie looks into his eyes.I think you're just a little kid with a really special gift who only ever wanted people to understand her. He smiles softly.So we're not all that different at all.Well, yeah, but what good would that do? You think just because there's bad people out there that there's no good ones either? I thought the same thing.For a while. But there's always someone out there for you. Somewhere. Aggie frowns, looking lost.I'm sorry, Aggie. She's gone.I think that's up to you. Aggie blinks through tears at the grass beneath her feet.It's a pretty good place to sleep. Then you can be with your mom again. Aggie holds Norman's gaze, then looks down to the ground, her tiny frame heaving with a last SOB. She sits down on the grass and curls up, resting her head on her hands. Norman kneels down next to her as she closes her eyes. Her breathing grows deeper and more peaceful; her tiny frame shifting softly under her long hair. The air around them grows blurry and indistinct. Aggie softens as though out of focus, and the whole world becomes a swirling dance of glowing orbs. Norman closes his eyes as a blizzard of light engulfs him, spiraling up into the clouds high above his head. Lightning flashes white far above and thunder RUMBLES softly through the sky, as if moving away.Sleep tight. He clambers down through the roots back toward the path.Mom, you're embarrassing me.Hey Neil. He climbs up beside his friend, who beams at him gleefully.I guess. I just wanted to say thanks. You stood by me. All the time.As normal as it could be.Hi Dad.A scary movie.", "clean_line": "zombie eating head grandma zombie coming dad sex violence thought said kids age busy shoplifting joyriding dad grandma says

Like, a seven pack at least.Yeah, she totally doesn't deserve him. I mean, she's nice and I really like her, but she's a complete loser. Yeah, I know. Courtney slumps into a chair at the table, twisting a strand of gum out of her mouth with a finger. Norman returns inside and shuts the door, pausing a moment as if thinking something over.O-M-G, you are such a liar! ParaNorman 4.Oh yeah? Prove it! Norman levels her a look that says \"you asked for this\".I knew it! You've been sneaking around in my personal stuff!You are the worst! Courtney, brimming with outrage, storms out of the kitchen, her ponytail wagging furiously behind her. Sandra kneels down beside Norman with a wearily sympathetic smile.So I said to her, \"Girl, come back and talk to me when your basket toss gets twelve thousand hits on YouTube!\" Yeah, no, I said that. Yeah, I'm stuck on lame patrol. Tonight's gonna be a total yawn. From downstairs, a door SLAMS. Courtney frowns, puts her hand over the phone and shouts out.Norman?!You better not be sneaking out you little weirdo!I'm gonna kill them. She impatiently leans down to push open the mail slot.I know you're in there! Slumber party's over, dorks! The door opens and she finds herself face to navel with Mitch, out of the shower with a towel around his waist. ParaNorman 39.Hell yeah. Courtney catches herself and quickly affects a LAUGH.Sorry to bug you so late, but does, erm... ...Neil live here?Oh wow! That's great! Your brother and my brother are like best friends! I'm Courtney. She tries to regain her composure as Mitch turns away.Hey there! How ya doin'... little guy...Yeah, Neil. Do you know where Norman is? He kinda disappeared.So Norman!No, it's fine. He sucks. But I really gotta make sure he doesn't die or anything tonight. Will you help me? Please? Mitch gets an eyeful of her best damsel in distress act, then SIGHS.And she said I could totally consider a career in formation swimming. But I was like, \"I wanna do something that helps people less fortunate than me\", thank you very much, y'know, like the poor or people who are like dying or ugly or something, `cuz I really think that ecology and world peace are like totally important today. Do you use free weights? Your deltoids are huge.Thank you for doing this Mitch. He means an awful lot to me. I love him like he was a brother.Is he dead or what?So he's okay?What? What did you just say? Mitch looks from the head back to the van, then at the head again. He licks his lips nervously as he thinks.That was insane!Norman, what just happened?!Sorry, who are you?I just knew something like this was going to happen tonight!Why d'you have to go and get everyone involved in all your weird stuff?!Oh my gosh, I think I'm having an aneurism! This is so typical of you!Oh, I understand! I understand that this is all getting completely out of... The van's sunroof is suddenly ripped open, and the Dead Judge's arm reaches down into the vehicle, clawing inches above Courtney's head.Norman! How do we stop them?! Norman looks again at the book in his hands.Well you better think of something quick! Norman wracks his brain.Mitch, do something! Mitch flicks on the windscreen wipers, which wipe the zombie's rotten flesh from side to side across the glass. Mitch and Courtney's eyes follow the Judge's movements from side to side. ParaNorman 52.Oh, I broke a nail! As Alvin climbs out, he gingerly holds up the Judge's arm, as if it were a dead animal, and dangles it limply in front of his face.Perfect. Now the geeks are in charge. The kids make toward the parking lot exit.Oh, this is awful! The zombies are, like, eating everyone! Norman points beyond the bedlam to the dark shape of the Old Town Hall in the plaza.Great! I'm super psyched! This is turning into the most fun night ever! The overhead light clicks on as Alvin steps into the room behind her and GROANS.We're not going to find it in here, Norman! This is useless!I can't believe this is your plan! I'm gonna get bitten and start eating peoples' brains! I'm supposed to be Vegan! Mitch suddenly SHOUTS out from the doorway.We tried and look what happened!I do too listen! And whatever it was you just said, it's not working! You think you're going to go out there and do your talking to the dead thing and this is all going to be okay? What are you going to do, ask the zombies not to eat you?Norman, you need to stop all this weird stuff and start living in the real world!C'mon! ParaNorman 67.Um, excuse me? Hello? Unmistakably living hands and arms suddenly SMASH through the barricade, clawing into the Town Hall. The kids recoil from the windows, SCREAMING as they bat ineffectually at the grasping hands.We're all gonna DIE!Mitch, if we die tonight, this might be the last chance I get to tell you how I feel. ParaNorman 76.Norman?You've gotta be kidding me... Norman, his mouth shielded by his sleeve, heads purposefully toward the front doors.Leave him alone! Courtney suddenly emerges, standing right in front of Norman. Following her lead in true \"I'm Spartacus!\" fashion, Neil, Mitch and Alvin step forward too, creating a barrier all around him, all joining hands in solidarity. CLOSE ON Courtney's face as she hisses sidelong to Alvin.Hand, Alvin! My hand! A ripple of confusion seems to run through the crowd.Everybody, listen up! You all need to stop trying to kill my brother! You're adults! Stop it! I know that this seems crazy, believe me I'm with you on that, but I think he does actually know what he's talking about!Yes you do, Norman! You've got to get to that witch's grave!But nothing! You listen to me, buster, we didn't turn away when Daleridge High was slaughtering our volleyball team, did we?No we didn't. I've cheered the uncheerable, Norman, and I'm not letting you give up now! Norman turns to Perry, his eyes all business.Norman! He's on my side of the seat!I heard that! Mom! Tell the zombie to stop saying stuff about me!Good job, Norman. Perry takes a deep breath and looks at his son. There is relief and a hint of admiration in his eyes.So I was thinking, maybe we could catch a movie sometime?

This is my moment! He shuffles toward Salma and swings his branch around, not realizing Alvin has slung the hangman's noose around Norman's neck. Norman is yanked off balance and staggers into Neil who keels over, rigid branch arms unable to stop his fall. He lands on top of Salma, her kicking legs sticking out from under him as though Dorothy's house had just landed on stage. The kids break into uncontrollable LAUGHTER. ParaNorman 13.Sorry! Mrs Henscher flings her script into the air, her face beet red.Norman, wait up!So do I. Let's do it together! You shouldn't let them get you down. They always do stuff like that to me.Because I'm fat. And my allergies make my eyes leak. And I sweat when I walk too fast. And I have a lunchbox with a kitten on it. And I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome. I guess there's a whole bunch of stuff.Nah. You can't stop bullying, it's part of human nature. If you were bigger and more stupid, you'd probably be a bully too. It's called \"survival of the thickest\".That statue just \"pissst\" at us! Wild-eyed Mr Prenderghast suddenly leaps in front of them, startling them as he staggers closer.The weird stinky old bum who lives up the hill?Leave him alone! An apple bounces off Mr Prenderghast's head. He turns to find Neil standing behind them on the path, lunchbox open in his hand providing leftover low-carb ammunition.Don't make me throw this hummus! It's spicy! Mr Prenderghast thinks better of it and turns to flee the scene. He HISSES out of the side of his mouth at Norman. ParaNorman 16.Jeez, what a dirty old creep!So is it true?Can you see ghosts? Like, everywhere? All the time?Awesome! Do you think you can see my dog Bub? He was run over by an animal rescue van. Tragic and ironic. We buried him in the yard. Could you see him? Norman frowns disbelievingly, completely taken aback.Sweet! Come on!Hey Mitch! We're gonna go play with the dead dog in the garden and we're not even gonna have to dig him up first! Mitch sits up. He's a strapping six-foot jock with tattooed biceps. The kind of guy who wears year-round flip-flops.Can you stop doing that? It's kinda stupid.Don't blow this for me, Mitch. This one's not weird. He talks to dead people. Neil has had enough and defiantly walks away from his brother.He's around here somewhere...Is he there? How's he look? Bub BARKS, then his front half notices his tail and runs behind to sniff his own backside.Go get it!Yeah well, it's still fun. Good boy! Bring it back! Go get it, Bub! Good boy! CLOSE ON Norman as he watches Neil toss the stick back and forth across the garden. The stick lands near his feet and he bends down to pick it up.Why don't you try?No, no, it's fun! Try it!You throw it. It's really easy.No, c'mon, it's really fun.No, you try it. I already went like fifty times.You get the stick, you pull it back, and you throw it!I fetched it! ParaNorman 20.What?Hey buddy! Are you okay? Norman turns around to find the knothole is now Neil's face, bulging out of the side of the tree with a look of concern. This is the last straw, and Norman SCREAMS.Norman? Alvin tears around the corner in pursuit, but Neil stands in his way, waving his arms indignantly.Hey! What's the big deal?Or what?I don't have boobs. These are pectorals! Alvin jabs him in the chest.Ow! My boobs! Neil swiftly steps aside. Alvin reaches the door to see Norman disappearing along the path as fast as he can. Alvin YELLS after him.You wanna play some hockey? Norman SIGHS.Is it all that walking dead stuff again?Ew. ParaNorman 31.So you wanna come play a bit later?Yeah, but I thought my idea was less likely to get us eaten. Norman knows he's on his own in this.But...I'm busy!No! The doorbell RINGS again.Neil?Oh no...I didn't really think he was serious about going up to the old graveyard on his own!I don't know. Maybe we should go look for him.Uh, is Norman in trouble?Kill me now.He is your brother. Courtney counters the backseat barbs by smiling demurely, but Mitch's attention has been drawn by something else.Look out! Mitch slams on the breaks, twisting the wheel.That was Norman! Shaken, Mitch realizes another figure is looming out of the darkness in front of them. He slams on the brakes again, but too late. The tall dirty-looking figure stands stock still as the van plows straight into him. Dust flies up from the wheels of the van as it skids to an eventual stop in the center of the road.Sorry. My fault. When I'm nervous I get mouth diarrhoea.Whaddawedo? Whaddawedo? Mitch?!You're the oldest!We've got to go back to the graveyard?I have an idea! ParaNorman 51.Oh yeah! Neil HUMS his very own action movie score as he runs to follow Norman out of the parking lot. ParaNorman 57.This is?This'll be a piece of cake, you'll see. He pauses, and frowns, squinting up his eyes as he reads aloud, very slowly.Page... One... Okay, page one. Mitch hefts a particularly heavy box file off a shelf. He seems to read the filing notes written across its front, then ignores them and begins curling it like a dumbbell. ParaNorman 62.Yes! Book number one! Finished! That is right, twenty six pages, oh yeah! Everyone GROANS and turns back to their bickering. ParaNorman 65.I'm not going anywhere. You can't make me. Mitch shrugs and picks his brother up, scooping him under one arm and carrying him out the door.I'm not speaking to you. You can't make me. Norman watches the doors shut behind them, and his anger begins to ebb. Alone in the archive room, he slumps to his knees feeling useless and frustrated.All night he's been trying to save you from the witch's curse!Jeez, what is her problem? Norman takes in the chaos around them... ParaNorman 80.So what do we do now?You did it! You stopped the witch's curse and made the zombies go away and saved pretty much everything!Yeah, of course. Don't get weird or anything. So you think now everything's gonna turn back to normal? Norman looks across the square.
