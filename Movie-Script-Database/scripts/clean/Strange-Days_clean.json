{"Strange-Days": {"LENNY": {"raw_line": "This is great... the doors are all locked. Who are these losers, friends of yours?Wow... the gas tank is a nice touch. Oh, oh, end of the line boys.Goddamnit! You know I don't deal in snuff. How many times I hafta tell you?!Well you could've at least warned me. You know I hate the zap... when they die. It just brings down your whole day. Jeez, Tick.How'd you get the tape? Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?Yeah, but how'd it get to you?Tick. Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that. I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit. And my customers want uncut.I don't deal black-jack clips! It's policy. I got ethics here.So lay it off to somebody else.Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens. I'm snorin'.I said that? Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.What else you got?Look, Jerr. I'm nothing if not a man of my word. I'll drop the money by tomorrow, next day latest. It's a little crazed right now. Yeah, on my mother's eyes, I swear. Thanks, buddy. Prick. What kinda move you call that?! Lemmings.Jimbo. I'm there, Jimmy. Right now, can't you hear me knockin'?-- so you line up the talent, shoot the clip, get it to me by Monday. OK? Client wants a guy and two girls, the guy wears... yeah, I know, thinks he's being original. Girls have to be young. So don't use your mother like you usually do. Yeah, you too, pendejo. And no big tits... French tits. That's it... like Champagne glasses... you got it. What a pro. Page me.I live here.I just got something in, Bobby, you might appreciate. A 211 at a Thai joint goes south, and these three scuzzballs end up in a gun-and-run. It's a beauty, two thumbs up. Parental discretion advised. I'm talking it's the master, not some stepped-on copy. One of a kind.Yo, Skinner. The Skin Man. Red leather. Nice feminine touch.Whattya got for me?Yeah, I can use this... ... but honey you gotta move your eyes slower next time. It's too jerky.Hi, Dave, this is Lenny. Nero. Lenny Nero. That's right. Oh, is it late? Sorry. It's just that I have something that might be of interest, and since I always call you first-- Uh, huh. Well, what would be a good time? Okay, sure. Catch you then.Okay, let's get you wired up. I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.Superconducting QUantum Interference Device. SQUID. Got it? There's gonna be a test.Easy, Eduardo, easy. Preserve a sense of humor at all times. Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder. See we call it \"being wired,\" but there's no wire. You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?Some tips. Don't dart your eyes around. Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself. OK? You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event. But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn. And don't act natural. Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on. Got it?A star is born.Watch and see.You know I can get you anything you want, anytime you want it, just not right now. We'll hook up at the club later. Around eleven. Yeah.Anything without an umbrella.Looks like money to me.10 percent, Fabri, like always.Just a second. Not to be rude, Keith, but I got to ask, are you a cop?You understand? Attorney! Right? Am I right?Tassel shoes. Entertainment law, would be my guess. Relax. I just like to guess, is all. It's my job to know people and what they want... what's behind their eyes.That's right. My second question I gotta ask, so we get our bearings here... have you ever jacket in? Have you ever wiretripped?A virgin brain! Well we're going to start you off right. So what do you know about this? Save us some time...I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.That's right. Clips. Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here. This isn't like TV only better. This is life. It's a piece of somebody's life. Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex. You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.Exactly anything. Whatever you want. Whoever you want to be. Fabri, get us another round, would you.You want to go skiing without leaving your den, you can. But I'm assuming a guy like you, you wanna go skiing you fly to Aspen. That's not what you're interested in here. It's about the stuff you can't have... right? The forbidden fruit.Like running into a liquor store with a .357 magnum in your hand, feeling the adrenalin pumping through your veins. Or... ... see that guy, with the drop-dead Philipino girl friend? Wouldn't you like to be that guy for twenty minutes? The right twenty minutes. I can make it happen. And you won't even tarnish your wedding ring.I can get you what you want. You just have to talk to me. I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls. I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious. You say it, you even think it, you can have it. You want a girl, you want two girls? I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy? You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up? It's all doable.Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste. I got a deck with me.Step into my office.You were just an eighteen year old girl taking a shower. Are you beginning to see the possibilities here?You nervous? Forget it. The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--Damnit, Max, I was with a client! You think that's funny? To mess with a man's livelihood? It's not funny!Okay. It was funny. But it cost me money.Least you can do.Thanks, Max.This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.You were lucky, Max.Naw. She won't call me.Thanks, Max. I'm touched by your concern.Hey, Iris, you okay?What's going on?Hang on, that's my car--Hey wait a second...Oh, yeah, that's the answer! Two million years of human evolution and that's the best idea you can come up with? Okay. Look, whattya get to repo a car? Two hundred? Two fifty? I'll pay you three fifty, right now. All you gotta do is drop it off the hook and say you came by, your mark wasn't here. Simple. Make a few bucks. Do a good deed. Huh?I was going to write you a check, if that's--Okay, okay, I totally respect that call. I would want cash. They'll take my check inside... I can see you're pressed for time, just give me two minutes... here keep my watch for collateral.It's a Rolex. Be right back. Two minutes.Son of a bitch!Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it? I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately. Have you noticed?Shutup a second!Thanks for giving me a ride. I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--Come on, Mace. This is gonna be a big night. Can't you feel it? The energy in the air? There's money to be made, dreams to sell.Just a couple of hours. It'll be fun--Mace, you're my friend. I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.Mace! You're a life-saver.No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service. I save lives.Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar. Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife. And maybe he really does catch something--Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are. But now the risks are outa line. The streets are a war zone. And sex can kill you. So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.Define illegal.Yeah, but that was for love.What's his name?Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation. We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests. I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.Coming with you.Strickland.Sure. Whatever. See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir. One of life's small pleasures.I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.Your sex life?Let's talk in the car.I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.Forget it's there.Hey, careful on the jacket. This is Armani. You angry?In LA? Are you crazy?Can I come in please? I'm having a hard time hearing the stereo.I need my case. It's still in the back.Listen, can we talk a little bit here, like two rational adults?That would be no.Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here. D'you mind?I thought we were friends.So am I. Just trying to get by.Macey... I've never seen you like this.I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace. Really.You still like me, don't you? We're still buddies?Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.Begging? Groveling? Any pathetic behavior at all? Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.Come on, let me buy you a drink. Let's drink and make up. Alright, I'm going to see Faith. That means you can watch me suffer. I'll be in agony, you'll feel so much better. Total and thorough payback, whatdya say?Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?Rams... that's football, right?She still loves me.She's my destiny.You'll see.You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning. Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.Faith, can I talk to you a second?I just got to talk to you for one second.That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?Faith, call me, okay?Tick, listen, I can't stop right now. but I'll call you tomorrow about that thing we were talking about.So, those rascals still haven't grown back yet, huh?Present. Something I had made. Let me know what you think.Fan mail from some flounder?Hi, baby. I've missed you.I'm already hurting.Yeah, OK, whatever you say. Just answer one question. Is anything wrong? Iris said you might be in trouble.Tonight.I know you Faith. You're afraid of something. What's going on?It's Tran, isn't it? This guy is poison, Faith. Listen to me. He's got you walled in on all sides. And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.Why don't you just split? You don't love him, anybody can see that. And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.What? He gonna record you on his label?Come on, Faith! He's just toying with you. And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing. You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it. And you will.It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him.Max Pelcher? You're kidding?Can't do it.Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.You should feel like shit.Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you. Hey, at least you got a job! Watch her for me. Stay on her.Can I get that?Thanks for the tip.I recognize you. You're Wade Beemer. Running back for the Rams, am I right?I saw you play, man. You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying. So what happened, injuries or what?It's always politics. Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right? But I could pay you more not to. See what I mean? I could write you a check right now--Okay cash! Logical. Here's everything I have on me, what do you say? How about a Rolex?Just not the eyes.They oughta get some lights back there. A person could get killed slipping on those stairs. Let's go.I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.It is my sword and my shield, Macey.No idea.It's a test pattern so far.Alright, a little B&E action.Hey, getting good. Solid suspense build.Go to the Sunset Sheraton. RIGHT NOW! Just go! GO!Holy shit. He's jacking her in to his own output. She's seeing what he's seeing. She's seeing herself.On my God. Oh my God.Black. Jack.Snuff clip. It was Iris. She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.Yeah. No, not really.Not now... I don't want to think about it--He stalks her. He rapes her. Then he does her...He records himself raping and killing her--So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her. The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him. I've seen a lot, Max.But this is a bad one.He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging. And he records it all.Wants to share.Why me?I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never. Everybody knows that.Jesus, Mace. Back off.Uh unh. No way! They'd crucify me.Iris is dead. She was murdered.Don't know. But this guy's real damaged goods. Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too. Now no more games, Faith. Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now. Don't even think about it.I have a gun. It's under my bed.Tell me.Charm.It's alright. He means it.Listen, can we be smart here? I could make it really worth your while... I could cut you a check for 500 each... hell, make it an even grand... I'm not saying you don't land a couple shots, just go light is all I'm saying... here, take my Rolex.Is this great fabric or what?Never really thought about it.Come on... look in the mirror. You know it's there, you're keeping your eyes off it, you bastard... SHIT! Who are you?He knows what he's doing. He's worn before... a lot.It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.I need to see more... get more detail. Something. I feel his presence, so strong...Yeah. I'm ghosting pretty bad.She came to me for help. I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.Sex killers act alone. So there's no information on the street, which is how cases get made. Cops know they'll never nail this guy the second they look at the scene.And anyway, nobody gives a shit about a dead hooker. They're roadkill.See, it's all about what they see walking in. A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong. Random kill. The kind you never solve.No it doesn't.She said \"If they get me\". They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.Because it had to look random. Not connected to anything or anyone. But then why give the rape to me?And what about the guy that was following me?The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough. You want to rub my neck?How's Zander?S'okay. I know you still love me.W'sup, Max?Faith OK?Looks like she was holding out.He's in this somehow... I don't know how. Just stay close to Faith.Jesus, Mace!Anywhere. We'll talk about it in the car.Hand me that box of tapes, will you?This tie doesn't go with blue!Mace, the guy had a knife. To my throat. In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!No shit. You got someplace in mind?Today I have...Easy, there, Mom. Easy. This is audio only. John Coltrane. \"A Love Supreme.\" Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.Later. Your mom'n I are heading right back out.Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.What?Who was just here?Wait, wait... wait a minute. Iris was here?!What clip? What was it?She never gave me a tape.She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...That's a handy little attitude adjuster. Damn. I'm boxed in.Nothing. Let's go play this back.What tape? I'm just trying to get my car back but the place is closed--It's in my case. Okay? I'm going to open my case...Take it and turn her loose. Okay?Oh no, we're not being followed, Lenny, Don't be so paranoid, Lenny.Shit!Bullet resistant? Whatever happened to bullet proof?Goddamnit!! 911 is busy!The gas tank's going to go any second!Are you out of your fucking mind?!Yeah, me neither. It was one of my favorites. Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday. I'm going to really miss it.Are we impressed yet?Those two guys were cops.It's the walk. Something. Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address. We gotta keep moving.Come on Zander. You can ride on my shoulders. Here you go.I can't tell you. You've got to see.Mace. I know what you think about the wire. But I'm asking you to do this. It's that important.Sorry this has to be your first playback.Keep your eyes closed, or you'll see double.Hang on. Hang on, Max. You see?Yeah I know. So what do we do?We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.I've got a good idea, yeah.Maybe. But tonight is probably not the best night. Come on, we're rollin'.So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me. Happy new year, Lenny.There's a plus side?It was a tough call.I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.To break the trail. If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too. Our killer is running as scared as we are. Which makes him really dangerous. Judging by how scared I am.You may be a little overdressed for this party. Yo, Tick! It's Lenny. Open up!Tick, I got to talk to you, man... oh shit.He's been cooked-offNo. But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs. They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.He's totally cut off from the outer world.Whattya mean?What stuff?Jesus.Thanks, buddy. See... things weren't bad enough. They weren't fucking bad enough!Yeah, right, blow it open.Okay... what about Strickland?Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland. The sanctimonious prick who busted me out. His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it. I know this guy. If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.Hey, Max, Mace... whoa... time out.Whoever killed Iris did Tick. It's the same sick wirehead shit. Same reason... to burn the trail. If Faith knows anything about this, and I think she does, then she's on the list. So... who's driving?Faith, we know about Jeriko. Iris made me a copy of the tape.How did it happen? What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?No. Mace is in this.Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.Leave here with me, right now.Owww!! Take it easy. Uh huh. So where are they now?What do you mean?This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?2-2-0-3. Got it. Stay on her.Okay, we gotta get over there. Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--Whatya mean? We're going! Tran's gonna do her right there unless--That sounds right. I'm going.What the fuck are you doing?!Have you ever been in love with somebody who didn't return that love?It didn't stop you from loving them. Right? Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them. Did it?I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity. I was lost, Mace. In outer darkness. Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank. Another lost soul.But she was different. There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice. It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice. I helped her. And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her. See? It's not about what's in her head. It's what's in mine. I can't let go of the promise. It's... like... it's all I have left.Mace... you're a girl.Got your ticket?You see Tran?Come on, Max. Come on, buddy... Damnit.Alright. We're going up.I still got one ace to play. Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...Exactly. That's why it's a make- able deal.See that guy? The one with the ramrod up his ass. That's Strickland.Take it to him.No. Trust me.Then we'll be right where we are now.Now, Wade, can we talk here, like two human beings--It's not personal.No, no, no...No. I suppose not. I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.Where's Faith?What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?Jesus!So... I killed Tran. Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.Wait a minute. Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?Was I a really busy guy? Did I do Tick too?So why Max... why d'ya have to do Iris? She never hurt anybody.I won't say anything.And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.So there never was a death squad.Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.How did you hook up with Faith?Jesus, Faith.Are you okay?SHOOT!Yeah, what?Naw. They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.Yeah. We did.See you downtown.", "clean_line": "great doors locked losers friends wow gas tank nice touch oh oh end line boys goddamnit know deal snuff times hafta tell ve warned know hate zap die brings

Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks. And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal. You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring! Let me buy you a drink.Fuckin' A right I'm mad! I might kill every man in here. But first I'm buyin' my buddy here a drink. Hey O'Neal! You were right, your wife does give good head.Bobbyyyy! Tequila por favor! Double shots. Make it Tres Generaciones, huh. Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad. Hey, nice tie.D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?That's not sayin' much.To the jungle! Where outa the blue some shitbird can cap you in the back of the head and ruin your whole day.Yup. So darn lucky. I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of. Good thing I wasn't any luckier. Bobby! Another shooter right here!You seen Faith lately?Just as well, Lenny. You gotta get past it. I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly. Broken hearts are for assholes.What happened, honey, some john get rough on you?There it is, the magic fuckin' word.See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.An ex-cop that doesn't carry. It's embarrassing. I oughta not be seen with you. Hey, Mace. What's goin' on?Sucks. (attention caught byTo the end of all things! You know how I know it's the end of the world? Because everything's been done, every kind of music's been tried, every government's been tried, every fuckin' hairstyle. How you gonna make it another thousand years, for Chrissake?I'm telling ya, it's over. We used it all up--Yup. He was Jeriko's manager. Bummer, Tran! Lost your golden goose. Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.Sssssh! Not in front of Lenny. You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.I was gonna tell ya. Hey, it's just a job. I feel like shit about it.I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time. Do us both good. Right?I'm on her.Ohhhh shit.Well... I've lost my appetite. For about a year.You alright? Y'okay?Let's work it.Come on, Lenny. You used to be good at this stuff. Play it down. What's the perp doing?And he records it. Thrill kill. Wants to see it again. And again.But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--So've I. Too much.Top ten.That's right. He wants to share. Needs an audience. This is one sick puppy.He's skull-fucking you, bud. Trying to get a reaction. Maybe pushing you to do something.Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.Naw, he's right. They'll figure Lenny's the perp, or go through his client list, ruin his life... such as it is. Look, I'll call the guys in Homicide... tell them she was a friend of mine and they'll keep me in the loop. Get me the forensics and all that. Get some sleep. I'll call you when I get something. And Lenny... I'd keep moving if I were you.Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.Not a whole hell of a lot. They've just been saying words over Jeriko. Tensions running pretty high down here. I'm telling you.Yeah. She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie. Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name. Paid cash.Yup. Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night. Another slick Lenny move.I'm on her, amigo. No worries. Gotta jam.Don't talk to anybody. Anybody. You're invisible. Okay? Just meet me at Tick's in a half hour. And Lenny... don't get pulled over.Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.Is he dead?Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.There's more to this whole thing than you think.All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes. I've heard stuff.Smoke. Rumors. I've heard stuff about a death squad. A group a guys loyal to the hardline school. Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.Yeah. So don't walk near me in public, alright.Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history. They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.No. Bad idea.Listen to me, Lenny... stay away from cops. All cops. You have no way of knowing who you can trust.Fine. Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains? The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground. And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves. It'll be all- out war and you know it.You really want that on your head?Tran, listen. I was wondering how you want me to work it tonight, down at the Bonaventure. You want me downstairs at the party or upstairs at the suite? Where you going to be, mostly?Everything's cool. Too much to drink.He's got her up in the room, under guard. And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'. So buddy... I say we work a trade.Give him the tape. See? It's fucking brilliant! The tape for Faith. I know he'll go for it. I can set it up.Come on! If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all. Whattya say? Just get your butt down here. If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room. It's 2203. You writin'?I intend to.This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby. Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran? You pinhead.Believe it. Now bring me the trodes, baby. Come on, quick.I'm not. Just a little poach job.Hey, he was going to kill you. And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.You shut the fuck up, right now, I'm gonna pull this fuckin' trigger!Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together. You know it's true.Here's how much I love you, baby.Don't make any assumptions about our friendship, Lenny.Only way I could stand your ties.I'll have that. Glock 22. Nice.I sent her to the party. I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.You just did.You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die. Shit being number one.That's pretty much the way it happened.That's right. They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment. The one I left for you at the club was a copy.You bet. Did you like it?Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody. It's too perfect.I know. So, I'm working for this puke, right? And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control.Only he doesn't know about me and Faith. So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else. And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase. So to buy time, I do the skank. I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall. And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.No plan is perfect, Lenny. Hey, cheer up. World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.You got froggy on me a couple times.I thought that riff about the Death Squad was pretty good. I hadda keep you from bringing the cops into it.Naawww.Yeah. Pretty zany, huh? All this shit caused by a random traffic stop. Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that. Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos. You gotta take what you can, while you can. Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right? But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.I said, 'Yeah. I'd even do it for free.'And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'Fucking bitch!!", "clean_line": "look preppy puke face fuckin pissed topsiders come amigo world marks knows work em like pal sell goddamn rat asshole wedding ring let buy drink fuckin right mad kill man buyin buddy drink hey neal right wife good head bobbyyyy tequila por favor double shots tres generaciones huh nothin best good friend lenny finest cop got thrown vice squad hey nice tie dress like fuckin pimp sayin jungle outa blue shitbird cap head ruin day yup darn lucky wake short floating brainpan cop pension live good thing wasn luckier bobby shooter right seen faith lately lenny gotta past mean sure faith far outstanding woman guy like hope mean completely deeply humiliating gone campadre hate pining away makes want vomit frankly broken hearts assholes happened honey john rough magic fuckin word packed piece ve guy sense ex cop carry embarrassing oughta seen hey mace goin sucks attention caught byto end things know know end world kind music tried government tried fuckin hairstyle gonna thousand years chrissake telling ya yup jeriko manager bummer tran lost golden goose couldn happen nicer guy sssssh lenny trigger maudlin display force tranquilize gonna tell ya hey job feel like shit figured hell prick money sure faith ok time good right ohhhh shit ve lost appetite year alright okay let work come lenny good stuff play perp records thrill kill wants time sending signal ve right wants share needs audience sick puppy skull fucking bud trying reaction maybe pushing problem lenny knows everybody naw right ll figure lenny perp client list ruin life look ll guys homicide tell friend ll loop forensics sleep ll lenny moving hey day world spend bed hell lot ve saying words jeriko tensions running pretty high telling yeah leaving tran got boogie real quick iris checked sheraton night false paid cash yup hey heard dropped tran night slick lenny amigo worries gotta jam talk anybody anybody invisible okay meet tick half hour lenny pulled sounds like tick celebrating dead psycho cops slash burn tape cover tracks thing think saying know high food chain thing goes ve heard stuff smoke rumors ve heard stuff death squad group guys loyal hardline school guys ve years city hall review boards goddamn media pissing necks suspending cops right left tying hands outa mouths people squealing save save fucking morons crime totally control yeah walk near public alright mace disrespect run clock news midnight got biggest riot history ll fucking smoke canada bad idea listen lenny stay away cops cops way knowing trust fine want blood running waist deep storm drains gangbangers ll spread like wave city burn ground fires start street cops ll capping moves ll war know want head tran listen wondering want work tonight bonaventure want downstairs party upstairs suite going cool drink got room guard working party acting smooth like nothin nothin buddy work trade tape fucking brilliant tape faith know ll set come gives shit kill em whattya butt shindig downstairs room writin intend piece puke hired kill baby believe isn right tran pinhead believe bring trodes baby come quick little poach job hey going kill ratfuck paid iris killed save sorry ass shut fuck right gonna pull fuckin trigger look baby guy known input junkie little od won surprise anybody way know true love baby assumptions friendship lenny way stand ties ll glock nice sent party figured wait killed tran know statistically second common word people right die shit number pretty way happened right ll original snuff clip apartment left club copy bet like picture feel like gotta share somebody perfect know working puke right says ll pay large hooker gotta bitch girlfriend cause knows score totally control know faith turn job gets somebody lose faith coin phrase buy time skank gotta tran figure cap chump fall better girlfriend loser ex boyfriend known criminal seen hassling public numerous times plan perfect lenny hey cheer world gonna end minutes got froggy couple times thought riff death squad pretty good hadda bringing cops naawww yeah pretty zany huh shit caused random traffic stop hey means know look planet total chaos gotta cause shitbird come fuckin head second dink hires month ago eyeball right faith knows right comes says hey max following ll buy drink explain says supposed downstairs baby said yeah free said going spending time fucking bitch"}, "MACE": {"raw_line": "Hello? Hey Lenny, whatup? Uh huh. Uh huh. Sure. So what happened to your car this time?Greetings, gents. So let's hear this week's sad story.No. I haven't noticed because I make my payments. So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?But I mean isn't he Faith's new--Whoa, whoa, whoa. I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds. I've already pulled twelve hours today.Sleaze to peddle.Excuse me. What part of NO don't you understand?Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.Jeez, you're pathetic. Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James. I'll take you there, you can get a cab.Driving Mr. Lenny.So, what's up with you? Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.Lenny, this shit's illegal.Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.Define love.Dammit, Lenny, you made me late.Fumitsu.Um, excuse me. Sir. Excuse me. Mr. Nero.What the fuck are you doing?You will not live to see the morning.Now listen to me... you have to get to bed young man. I mean it. No watching \"Tales from the Crypt\". I don't care what Cecile says. I'll see you in the morning, baby. Night, night.Are we having a bad night?I've had enough of this shit. You're on foot, Lenny.Get it.I've had it. No more wirehead shit in my car. You understand? You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another. You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act. Well I'm out. I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.No, you're just trying to get off.Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life. You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next. And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it. Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.Look, I gotta get some sleep.Yeah. I don't see a way out of it.Jesus, Lenny.Sure, Lenny. The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.Guy named Wade Beemer. Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 andForget her.She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit. Trust me on this.Destiny? You living in a perfume commercial? She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.Hey Lenny, where the hell are you, I think Tran's got Beemer looking for you.You're some piece of work, you know that. Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.What I'm saying. But you still come out this goofball romantic.What's that? Present from Faith?What is it?My God, Lenny. What is it?Blackjack? I don't understand--Are you sure it's real?No way.And gives it to you.Cause you're the man, right? The Magic Man. If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created. It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.Take the tape to the cops.So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--Safety's on.Lenny!You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?So that gives you something.Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.No more, Lenny.It's not your fault.But that doesn't add, does it.Because Iris knew somebody was after her.So the guy's not a sicko.Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up. But why not just put a little lead in her ear?That's where it gets a little strange.Now you're really getting paranoid.Sure.OK. He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier. I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway. I'm sorry.Just Lenny.Are you going to make me beg?What is that?Well give me some then... I'm starving.Whatup Lenny?Where we going?What is it?Will you relax. There's nobody back there.You better keep a low profile for a while.Lenny, have you lost it completely?Cecile.You're not the only little boy I have to look out for, honey.We know that, Tick.Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.Something in your car...What's it say?Lenny, give them the tape.Take it easy. The glass is bullet resistant.Lenny. Calm down. This is what I do.It's okay, Lenny They'd never get here in time anyway.This is bad.Fire's out, isn't it?Get in here. Come on Lenny, move it. MOVE!!Get ready to hold your breath.Lenny, kick out hard, then just follow me. Okay?I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.Hey Curtis? Just drive.You sure?We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there. Let's go. Chop chop.Cecile, get in the car. Now.He's with me.Tell me.Uh unh. I won't do it.I see. I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.You know what this tape could do if it gets out.People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One. Jesus. Maybe they ought to see.Listen to me, little sister. There's something going on, and it's very big. Now you've got to take care of Zander. And stay off the streets tonight... you hear me on this?Curtis. What about you? Do we understand each other? You stay put.Well, look at the plus side.Yeah. You gave up your hot tub tape to save me. That's real progress for you.I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.Why?How long does it last? Oh.This seems a little sophisticated for them. These are not subtle guys.The only card we have to play is the tape. You know, we get it to the media somehow...Who's Strickland?So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen? It happened! The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America! Who the fuck are you to bury this?!Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!Tell us.Why didn't he just go public with the tape? Save himself that way.Come on. We're out of here.Yeah, uh... he slipped on the stairs. We're taking him to emergency. Excuse me.You are a pussy-whipped sorry-ass motherfucker, you know that?I'm not going.Lenny... shutup. Just park your mouth and listen. It's a set-up. Think about it! Why's he been sending you tapes? To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion. This guy's bent enough to think of that.You gonna get yourself killed for this? This toxic-waste bitch!Lenny! This is your life, Lenny! Right here. Right now. This is realtime... not playback. Real... time. Time to get real. Understand what I'm saying... she doesn't love you. Maybe she did once, I don't know, but she doesn't now. These are used emotions. It's time to trade them in.Lenny, memories were meant to fade. They're designed that way for a reason.Yeah. Lenny. I have.I guess.No. It didn't.You never told me.No, it's not.Come on, Lenny. Let's go to a party.That's it. Let's bail.Good, Lenny. I can see why the detective gig didn't work out. Come on.No. They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.Uh unh.And do what? Take on his whole posse?That's the original. There are no copies.Look. That tape is a lightning bolt from God. It's worth more than you, more than me, more than Faith. You understand? It can change things. Things that need changing before we all go off the end of the road. And you do not have the right to use it for currency. You go... you go alone. This is where I draw the line. I care about you Lenny... a lot more than you know... which makes us both pretty stupid. But you pawn that tape, you mean nothing to me.Ah, hell. Lenny--A cop? You want me to trust a cop?!Oh boy. What if you're wrong?Yeah, right. Fucked.There's a tape in there you need to see. I mean right now.Just look at the tape! You want to know who killed Jeriko One? Go in the stall right now and hit Play.Damn! I knew it--All the way down! RIGHT NOW!!Wait. Let me tell you what's going on here--NO!! NO!!!I got 'em, Lenny.Are we under arrest?Hey, Lenny. We made it.Well... Get going. You're still bleeding.Yeah.
