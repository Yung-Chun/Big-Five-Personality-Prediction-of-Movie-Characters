{"Kalifornia": {"BRIAN": {"raw_line": "Her father worked the night shift here. Most nights he'd bring her with him. She was eleven years old.This is it. This is the where he'd take her whenever he had the urge to molest her.Of course! Nobody would have heard her cries over the noise of the machines.This is where she murdered her first victim. They found his body over in the corner, shot through the head.They found her second victim over there.She lured them here with the promise of sex. Imagine the anger and hatred she must have felt returning to this place. Did she use that to help her pull the trigger?Dead.Man.Real.I'm talking about the mind and culpability of a serial killer. Someone who has no ability to distinguish between right and wrong should not be imprisoned, let alone executed.Look, it's a fact, most of these people suffer from a severe chemical brain imbalance. That enough Tequila?The answer is research and treatment under hospital supervised conditions, not the electric chair!Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.Ha, ha.No, it wouldn't make me feel better.Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.A... I gotta go.Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.I picked up some Chinese. Did you hear from the gallery?You got your slides back....I do.Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we......just like that?...These are great.Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing....I think it's the best stuff I've done....and I think I know why.Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it.What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California. \"We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean.\"We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out....It's either the best idea I've had in a long time... or there's way too much MSG in this stuff....the whole thing's going to slide into the ocean... Yeah, I know....I would.Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'I like that.Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta \"Deliverance.\" \"Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!\"\"Aintry? This river don't go to Aintry.\"Lighten up...Hi I'm Brian... Early, and you must be Adele.Let me help you.Tight fit.Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.Brian.So what do you do Early?So Adele, did Early happen to mention the places we'll be stopping at?That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.How much do I owe you?The Novaks are all gone but the fence that Michael Zaruba was hired to put up is still here.The Novaks embraced the young drifter as one of their own.Neighbors said he was a quiet young man, who was often seen pushing the children on the swing set.Everything was fine until the day the family ran out of work for Michael, and had to ask him to leave.Sorry, Early... Could you step out the way, for a second?The first one to die was the nine year old daughter...Hello....My name's Brian, what's yours?...Could I speak to your parents?Hi, my name is Brian Kessler.I'm a writer, I'm working on a book about famous murderers....I'm sure you're aware that this is the Novak house......I mean, this was the Novak house... With your permission I'd like to come in and photograph...We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes......That house is part of American history now, whether he likes it or not.Well we've come three hundred miles so far. Not a bad day's haul.You got any family or friends in California, Early?No.He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.Bitch, bitch, bitch!I heard that....heard that too.Look Carrie, we're gonna be stuck with these people for a week......And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.Carrie.He didn't stiff us. He paid for the gas remember.You finished?Morning...Nice job Early.All set?Take your time.It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.Who?Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.I guess it's your turn to pay Early.That bad?Dahlia, no.Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.Yeah.Sure.Early Grayce, June twenty third.I suppose anything's possible.I can hold my own...Why'd I open my big mouth?By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.Yeah?Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?These aren't Lucky Lager, I ordered Lucky Lager.Nothing, I jus...What?They don't stock it here Early.Last one.No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.What were you \"swinging a sickle\" for?Gotta see a man about a mule... What's wrong?Who said he's my good buddy?Hey come on, you two were drinking too... so what's the big deal.How do you know that?Yeah, for stealing a car. Aaahhhh.Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.Of course! The accent, the clothes, and those table manners!... He's got to be a mass murderer! What else could he be?You know, it wouldn't even surprise me if he turned out to be... a Republican!Goddamnit!... my fucking toe!I'm okay, thanks.What! What!What is it?A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.His mother had him working in here before he was eight years old... killing animals with a sledgehammer that was bigger than he was.When she was pissed at him, she'd beat the shit out of him and lock him in here overnight......Eventually the boy wakes up one morning, picks up that sledgehammer and starts hurting back.There's more...Look... I know you're pissed off about the gun, and I don't blame you...Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright? But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.Why, what did he do?Adele, what are you doing back here?What was that?Carrie, what's wrong? Early, we went through this already, you have to leave.What happened back there?How many people have you killed Early?None.If you say so.What are you getting at?...Ha....way too much MSG.Forget about it, doesn't matter.Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here....They asked them just before they were executed why they did it. They said \"to be famous.\" Why do you do it?We both know you didn't have to kill that gas station attendant.You wanted to. Why?It make you feel good? Powerful? Superior, what? Come on Early, tell me something. Were you angry?Who are you angry with Early... your mother, your father?No, no, I can't....Don't do it. Early, look at him, look at his face. That's not your father.Carrie... stop it.Shut up Carrie, please... just shut up!Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.Adele for god sake please lis...You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.Then try again,Carrie, watch for Early.I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.I don't know.What happened to Adele?Which way did they go?Take your car and get to that phone. Call the police.Carrie... Carrie... it's over....Sorry 'bout this Early.", "clean_line": "father worked night shift nights bring years old urge molest course heard cries noise machines murdered victim body corner shot head second victim lured promise sex imagine anger hatred felt returning place use help pull trigger dead man real talking mind culpability serial killer ability distinguish right wrong imprisoned let executed look fact people suffer severe chemical brain imbalance tequila answer research treatment hospital supervised conditions electric chair executing killer wouldn bring mother ha ha wouldn feel better okay want talk good versus evil let start adam eve snake gotta tonight turned pretty interesting warehouse drunk happened different visceral picked chinese hear gallery got slides carrie come leave anytime like great hey heart wake sat tapes photographs great way started writing think best stuff ve think know moment night understood came pull trigger look fuck thesis think book photographs research book infamous murderers america want lived killed want photograph thinking drop tennessee arkansas texas straight shot california stop hit fucking ocean money ll figure best idea ve long time way msg stuff thing going slide ocean yeah know real polite kept calling sir like beggars choosers ones answered ride share note remember oh yeah real accent right outta deliverance said ya ass woods aintry river aintry lighten hi brian early adele let help tight fit uh stop adele haven time breakfast early brian early adele early happen mention places ll stopping good idea unfortunately executed owe novaks gone fence michael zaruba hired novaks embraced young drifter neighbors said quiet young man seen pushing children swing set fine day family ran work michael ask leave sorry early step way second die year old daughter hello brian speak parents hi brian kessler writer working book famous murderers sure aware novak house mean novak house permission like come photograph minutes house american history likes ve come miles far bad day haul got family friends california early help way raised kinda feel sorry bitch bitch bitch heard heard look carrie gonna stuck people week saying think ought try carrie stiff paid gas remember finished morning nice job early set time work progress kinda rough henry lee lucas convicted killing claimed killed killed strangers spent years moving place real hard track guess turn pay early bad dahlia people think killed disappeared society thought work serial killer took time care bisecting human enjoying stopped yeah sure early grayce june suppose possible hold open big mouth way pool player yeah wait minute gonna hustle aren lucky lager ordered lucky lager jus stock early saving ass swinging sickle gotta man mule wrong said good buddy hey come drinking big deal know yeah stealing car aaahhhh stop fucking melodramatic murder locked parole case wouldn allowed leave state course accent clothes table manners got mass murderer know wouldn surprise turned republican goddamnit fucking toe okay thanks copy tape recorded mother working years old killing animals sledgehammer bigger pissed beat shit lock overnight eventually boy wakes morning picks sledgehammer starts hurting look know pissed gun blame okay cheap thrill stupid admit alright let blow let photos oh come shit wanted photos wanted adele carrie wrong early went leave happened people killed early getting ha way msg forget matter brothers prospectors lived years picked hitchhikers young men brought asked executed said famous know kill gas station attendant wanted feel good powerful superior come early tell angry angry early mother father early look look face father carrie stop shut carrie shut adele gotta early kills adele god sake lis gotta talk looks ll listen try carrie watch early going try lift end piano slide cuffs free know happened adele way car phone police carrie carrie sorry bout early"}, "EARLY": {"raw_line": "Coffee and a bowl of chili, please.Make that to go....Size 6.That's right ain't it, size 6?Happy birthday Adele.Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.He said that, huh?

Might cure them hiccups.Shit!Where's the personnel office at?What's up Adele? Dinner ready?Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn... ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...Well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of Lucky Lager and climb up on toppa' that famous Hollywood sign and howl at the moon...Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.I heard that.They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.What's this?What kind of a person would carry a cactus in her purse!You just smile, let me do all the talking.As many times as it takes.Best kind.Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to...Yeah Bri' I did.You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?...Too bad.All right, who gets the... ...water.Here you go Bri'. Got a couple a bags of chips and some jerky, just holler if you want some.Can't hurt.Forget it.Shush, Adele.Forget about it Bri'. I wouldn't be surprised if that Karma thing don't come back and get him.Nope... You?Thanks Bri', I'll get the next one. Think it's time we hit the sack.Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.Which one.Only if they let me put mine down too.Bri'.She wasn't feeling so good.Nah... Don't eat breakfast. Never have.Well don't be, I got plenty more where this one came from....Need a hand with those bags?I got 'em.This the book your writing?This guy killed a mess of people.Henry Lucas.Wonder what all them people done made him so mad?Here Bri' let me do that.How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?Hey Bri'... ah... You don't want to go in there. It's a real mess, if you know what I mean....Then some.Call it an even thirty.I'll drive Bri'.Adele, get in the back....They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?Now why is that?You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?That your... \"theory\", ain't that what they call it?You wanna hear mine?Ain't you goin' to record it?Well I'll just bet he's still alive. Old, livin' in some trailer park or somethin' somewhere, but still alive. Thinkin' every night 'bout what he done. Goin' over and over it in his mind. How smart he was for getting away with it.You ever play any pool Bri'?I wonder if there's any \"doors\" out here?You know... \"openings\" to other dimensions. I read there are a lot of them out West, mostly in the desert. They say if you know what you're doing, you can travel anywhere in the Universe in a matter of seconds. Wouldn't that come in handy?Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.Nah... how much money have you got?You'd better hit him first Bri', 'cos it's comin'.Hit him.Bri' this shit ain't Lucky Lager!Got to see a man about a mule.Gotta take a piss.Any reebs left in the back seat?Aaahhhhh... That's what we used to call a beer when we was kids... Beer spelled backwards....Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.Hey, that's what buddies are for, right...?You know those doors I was talking about? Found two of them back in Kentucky. Shit, I wasn't even looking for one the first time. Me and the boys are just swingin' our sickles by the side of the road, and I turned around and there it was... this door with this bright blinding white light all around it... course I'm thinkin' I must be sunstroked or somethin'... so I close my eyes figurin' I'll count ten and it'll be gone right... so I'm countin'... ...1-2-3-4-5... an' I'm 'bout ta piss myself right... -6-7-8-9... 10. An' I open my eyes slow, spectin' it won't be there right......and it wasn't.For... 'bout three years.Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?I can feel it start to run down my neck... ...and down my back... right into my pants....and everything starts stickin' together... keeps running down the back of my legs like two rivers racin' for my boots, see who gets there first.You never get that hot, huh?...never?You like Skynard?Only thing my old man ever gave me is that goddamn .45.Bri', you're jerkin' it when you pull the trigger, hold it real steady.Steady... Breath in... now let half of it out, and... fire.Bri, I want you to keep this gun... consider it a present. Never know, California could turn out to be a dangerous place.Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.I ain't ridin' in no bus... bitch.You just sit there and keep your mouth shut.I knew that boy'd have a hogleg here somewhere.Get over here.Sit your ass down in that corner.Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here... Do it Adele... Now!What's your name, boy?Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?I don't know. Wish I did.Shut your mouth.Where you from Walter?Never heard of it, any huntin'?Turkey's are real smart. Smarter than most people think...Tell you what Walter, you lie down there now... You make sure you stay put for a while after we leave... Okay?What do you need a Bible for?You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?Here you go.I wonder if Adele would like one of these? Nah...What the fuck!'Fraid not Bri'... Drive Adele.Hate to be an Indian-giver but I'm gonna have to ask for my gun back.Everybody just shut up!You two just cooperate and do what I say, and we'll all arrive safe and sound in California, as planned... unless, of course, Adele don't kill us first with her driving.What the hell is this stuff?Yeah but, what is it?And just what exactly are the Chinese doing here in the middle of the American desert anyway?... Didja get the beer?...\"Chink\" beer!Oh hell, I'm sorry Bri. Adele, honey, untie Brian, he's starving over there. Carrie, you want some?Where's the damn forks and spoons at!...Is it just me, or has this whole trip been goin' downhill ever since we ran outta Lucky Lager?Well now, how many people d'you see me kill?...Well then, that's how many I killed.Damn right I do.You never killed anyone have you Bri'?You never even seen anybody killed, right?You wanna tell me how'n the hell you gonna write a book 'bout somethin' you don't know nothin' 'bout?Ya see what I'm sayin'? Ha!...watch out for that stuff, it bites.No way. I guarantee you he was breathing when I walked outta there.Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?Hell it don't... ...Hand me Brian's map there Adele. One day I'm gonna pass some store and see your book in the window. Me and Adele gonna buy a copy for our coffee table.Figured your hands might be starting to hurt.Let's have a look. You girls coming?Don't worry Bri', I'll take the pictures. ...you stay here with Carrie. You run off... Bri' pays the price. Karma, remember?So tell me... what happened here?...and?Where'd they do it?Bri.This ain't going to give me nightmares, is it?Do what Bri?You want to know about my daddy, I'll tell you about my daddy, Bri...Tell me that don't hurt.Shoot him. You'll be doing him a favor.It's the answer to all them questions of yers.Now you'll never know.I know that. That there is a policeman in a world of pain. And this is what you call a mercy killin'.I'm still waiting.Not so much as a simple \"thank you.\"Thank you for what? What are you thanking me for Adele?Well Adele... it was for... ...saving your fucking life back there!Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?Hey Bri... You ever stop to think that if you switched the two letters in your name... ...it would spell Brain.What's wrong with her?I'll bet she did.Where's your husband?Well 'Peaches'... you're a widow now.Have you seen this one? That don't leave much to the imagination now does it?That's you ain't it?Well they say there's room fur all kinds in California... and that's where we're gonna be this time tomorrow. California. Adele honey?Adele?Peaches! Come on back here. There ain't nothin' for you to be afraid of.Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!Oww! Oww!! -- FUCK!!!!Honey... What do you think you're doin'?Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.You two been busy in here.Well, let's put it this way. I need me a new woman.Sorry about this Bri...Think anyone will notice?I'll bet there's a 'door' out there... save us some time.Pass me a beer hon'.You wanna hit me with that, huh?Stop lyin'... I can see right through you.Who d'ya think you're foolin'? I know you better than you think...I seen the way you been lookin' at me since we met... Snappin' my photo when you thought I wasn't lookin'. Wanting me...I saw you when I killed that boy...You were plenty hot.Sick... some people might say takin' photos of me and Adele humpin' in the back of the car is sick....You know what I mean?That's better... Honesty... I like that in a woman.But I'll tell ya... when we get to California, we're gonna have to do something 'bout that gutter mouth of yours.Come on.Howdy, my name's Early Grayce and this is my girl Carrie. I hope you don't mind us bargin' in like this but a... we was on our way to California when our car broke down, and...Well... it's gettin' pretty rough out there, so if it's all the same to you, we'll be staying the night.You'll like it...Not a lot, but you'll like it.I knew there was doors out here!That was damn tricky of you Bri.Go ahead Bri, ask me something. You wanna know how I'm feeling'? Well I'd say I'm feelin' pretty damn good.How 'bout you? You feelin' good?...'Cause you sure don't look so good. Or maybe you're feelin'... powerful. That it, you feeling powerful? Superior? I know I am.What? Am I angry with my daddy? Now why would I be angry with my daddy... you're the one hit me with the shovel.
