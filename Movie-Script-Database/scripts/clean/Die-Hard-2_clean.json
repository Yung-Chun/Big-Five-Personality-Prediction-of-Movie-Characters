Carmine Lorenzo know you don't go home after you punch out?I'm a veteran myself, Marvin. And a married one. You married?My wife may be in some trouble upstairs. I gotta find out.

How about a sixpack of malt liquor?in the TUNNELS, he tosses off his sweater into the darkness. Underneath, his shirt is already sweat-stained. And then he HEARS the gunfire - it's close! He gets his bearings -LUNGES through a wall of STEAM -deliberately SMASHES into the cross bars he passes, one after another, the SMACK of his body into them sounding like linebackers in combat -has a moment of satisfaction - thenOh, fucklands, HARD, the plywood boards from the top of the scaffold SWEEPING him off his feet - his gun SKITTERS across the linoleum towards the far end of the slidewalk - he rolls over and SEESYou okay?.Time you don't have...What...?So are you.

What's lesson two - the Neutron bomb?CAMERA PUSHES IN on him as he turns and looks out the window.No... no, Jesus, Mary, Mother of God, no... pull up... pull up...Behind the plane, watching the fireball roll away from him. He gives the scream of an. animal in a trap and falls to his knees.Relax, pal, I'm not a survivor. I'm just another victim.

Everything from... lost kids to hostages... but... all of it was... taking care of business... taking care of peoplle... until tonight. Tonight, everything I did, everything I tried...And...?John McClane.Unfortunately the pros are on the other side. Colonel Stuart is one of your boys -Trudeau. Did things just get better... or worse?That's all we keep hearing. Can you do anything with it?My wife has less than two.Except Colonel Stuart? The kid can't answer. Then Grant appears, the MAN from the Justice Department in tow.They kind of busted me down to buck private.The code... the code's still punched... where did you get this?How about I let you live?Marvin... you show me a shortcut to runway fifteen and you got yourself a liner for that coat.Come to poppa, you son-of-a-bitch- He flies up the ladder - and BRUISES his shoulder against the locked grid.Shit!Thought you'd pull this off, didn't you? I guess you didn't count on me being here. Actually, I didn't count on me being here.Just a cop who's spent half his career busting scumbag lowlife dope dealers. Looks like it's business as usual. Think this will look good on my record? Suddenly BULLETS PING on the hatch inches from McClane's head.he's HIT in the left hand.Esperanza's down... but he's hurt. I killed one more man... that's six they've lost all together..The story of my life. But the enlisted men seem sympathetic. And so doesStuart's guys? Yeah.
