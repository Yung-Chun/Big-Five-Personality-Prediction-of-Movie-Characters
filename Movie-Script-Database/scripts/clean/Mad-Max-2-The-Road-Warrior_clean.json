I guess I got myself some guzzolene. He raises his bow, aiming at MAX'S head, preparing to fire.Drop the weapons... Now back up. MAX throws down the tyre iron and unhitches a bolster which contains a sawn-off shotgun. The CAPTAIN slings the gunbelt over his stoulder.You're quick, I'll give you that. Never seen a man beat a snake. Never. Reflexes, that's what you've got. Me? I've got brains. He taps his head as they arrive at the black-on-black.Now, where's this booby-trap? MAX reaches under the car. His hand groping for a machete clipped to the chassis. His fingers wrap around the handle.A fella - a quick fella - might keep a weapon under there. He nuzzles,the bow against the back of MAX'S head.Then I'd have to pin his head to the panel. MAX slides his hand away, disconnects a series of mechanical fuses and shows them to the CAPTAIN. He moves to open the driver's door. The CAPTAIN reacts quickly, raising his bow, motioning MAX back.Oh no! You don't play me the fool. The CAPTAIN, keeping the crossbow trained on MAX'S head, opens the door. The DOG flies out, leaping for the CAPTAIN'S throat. The crossbow discharges, narrowly missing MAX as he hurls himself at the CAPTAIN. The steel arrow buries r itself in the car door. MAX pins the CAPTAIN to the ground and recovers his shotgun. Sc, 16. Cont...Gas! Petrol! Guzzolene! Listen! Hundreds... thousands of `gallons... as much as you want... MAX eases off the trigger.Not far. Ten... maybe twenty miles. Pumping it they are. Refining it. Kachunk... kachunk... kachunk... Day and night. A huge tanker full.It's there, you betcha... I'll. tell you straight though - it's not self service. It's under guard. Too hard for me. But a man with your ingenuity... Jesus I reckon... MAX rams the barrel against the CAPTAIN'S head.Kill. me, and you'll never find out. MAX drags him to his feet and pushes him towards the black-on-black.Okay, there it is. If anyone can get in, I know it's gonna be you. Me,.. I've gotta feed the snakes. Sc. 21, Cont -A man lives by his word, I reckon. And I've kept mine... MAX gets to his feet and hauls the GYRO CAPTAIN to a nearby tree stump.Look! We had a deal: I show you the gas - You let me go. MAX starts to chain him to the stump.What's up!! MAX ignores him, concentrating on the situation below. ' The bulk of the MARAUDERS have split into three groups each chasing a camp vehicle off into the wasteland. The HUMUNGUS leads one of the groups. Four MARAUDERS, camped on a pinnacle, keep watch on the camp, Suddenly another vehicle bursts out of the camp and speeds across the plain towards MAX'S clifftop. It passes out-of sight around the back of the hill, MAX hurries from his canopy across the other side of the hilltop.Jesus! He's gonna kill her. MAX whips his telescope around...Hey! What about me?!! The black-on-black roars off...You can't just dump me! Think of us as partners. MAX tosses him a set of keys, shouting over the engire.What sort of deal's that?! I'm running on empty!Watch your tyres! Turn left! Down over the CAPTAIN'S shoulder we see WEZ'S bike coming alongside the prime mover's rear wheels on the driver's side. 76. THE ROAD APPROACHING THE RISE. tAY. 76. WEZ lifts his feet onto the saddle, steadies himself and leaps onto the back of the prime mover. As the vehicle crests the rise, MAX sees the camp below. He yanks the air horn lanyard...Don't lose it now! We need the fuel! The CAPTAIN grabs whatever he can find - the two ferry cans and his chains and throws -:hem at the chase below. 82.

MAX hesitates, then shakes it briefly. The KID laughs - be finds this hand shaking-business hilarious. As MAX moves on to the pyramid workshop, the FERAL KID follows in his footsteps, mimicing his squeaky, stiff-legged gait.I know you're afraid darlin'. But I'll let you into a secret, sweetheart. I'm afraid too. He squeezes her tight. She caresses his hand.I just want you to know that I don't agree with them, He indicates the people in Pappagallo's tent.I don't think you're a coward. A bit stupid - but not a coward, Where else you gonna find what we 've got here? Food... fuel... clean women. MAX goes back to work, putting the finishing touches to the ramp.Men, too, if that's your inclination. Jesus! All we've got to do is get away from that Humungus. With you driving the tanker we can do it. I know you can. I saw you out there. Stay with us Max. Drive the tanker. MAX gets up, snaking his head.Thanks. Thanks a lot.

Touch those tanks and BOOM! You'll blow yourself apart. The CAPTAIN looks quickly in the direction of the black-on-black, and back to MAX. He gestures with the crossbow.There's one more.Where?Balls!Where?The contract was: wouldn't kill you. The GYRO CAPTAIN turns angry, protesting. MAX pushes the shotgun close to his face.I reckon you got a bargain... Don't you? The CAPTAIN shuts up. MAX tests the chain. The sounds of the battle continue.Let's get this straight. I'm doing it 'cos I need fuel.Stay alive! Stay alive!Two, three miles away.,, left for dead.,, next to his car. We made a deal. In the background the FARMER starts to work the first arrow out of NATHAN'S chest. BIG REBECCA comforts him. Sc. 45. Cont...Running hard to the south west. In heaps of trouble. Listen: he said if I brought him in, you'd give me gas. There's no time... An anxious young man pushes through the crowd, talking over MAX. This is the QUIET MAN.She's dead. The man struggles to keep hold of his emotions.It was quick. The QUIET MAN bows his head and turns away. NATHAN groans, ANGIE has the clear plastic mask of an air viva device over NATHAN'S face, PISMO pumps air into his lungs. MAX turns to PAPPAGALLO:I saw a man in trouble. I brought him in. And now I just want to get out of here. Give me my gas. Sc. 45. Cont.We had a contract... The FARMER succeeds in removing the first arrow. BIG REBECCA relaxes NATHAN sputters. Blood sprays into the plastic mask. BIG REBECCA screams. The FERAL KID looks on as the FARMER feels for a pulse: nothing. PAPPAGALLO turns to MAX:Its OK, Dog. Just do as they say... His words are lost in the wail of a siren. A guard perched in the watch tower shouts a warning. The yellow school bus roars across, closing the entrance.Two days ago I saw a vehicle that'd haul that tanker. All eyes turn to MAX.You wanna get out of here. You talk to me.So that's my offer. I deliver a prime mover - in return you give me my black car and as much gas'as I can carry. All I need right now is three jerry cans of diesel and five gallons of petroleum. They look at him quizzically. Think of it as a down payment.There's only one way to find out. He lifts the barrel to the CAPTAIN'S head. The CAPTAIN moves off towards the gyrocopter.It's up to you. Fly a kite, or follow me back. Maybe they'll throw some gas yourWe had a contract. I did my job, I got my car and I got my gas. End of story.Yeah. I tried it once! Now forget it, 'cos I never get involved. I'm leaving. I leave tonight. PAPPAGALLO is about to reply when a scream echoes through the camp. They all turn to look: the men working on the prime mover are running towards the battlement, An ominous drumming begins in the Marauders' camp.I haven't got time to explain. Just believe me - I've got everything I want. The CAPTAIN starts to interrupt but MAX cuts him short.Good luck tomorrow. I hope you make it. Sc. 106. Cont.Get out. Scat! Go back. The FERAL KID looks at him, puzzled, then throws his head back, howling. MAX stops the car, looking round, nervous. The first light of dawn appears on the horizon. MAX turns to the FERAL KIYou're a fine kid, but you can't come. You've gotta learn - don't get close to people. It can churn you up... The KID can't understand a word, so just grins. MAX thrusts his hand into his back pocket and produces the hurdy-gurdy. He shoves it into the FERAL KID'S hands, opens the door and pushes him out.I'll drive the tanker... Everybody stops, turning to look at him. MAX is staring at PAPPAGALLO, swaying slightly, hands clenched,Until you're clear of trouble... The CURMUDGEON breaks in:But I'm still the best you've got. PAPPAGALLO thinks for a long moment.,No! The other way!! The KID slips in the first cartridge, then the second... He snaps the gun shut and tries to aim it at the GAYBOY BERSERKER... but can't find the trigger. The GAYBOY BERSERKER raises the crossbow... MAX grabs the gun and fires... The GAYBOY BERSERKER disappears over the side... MAX rams the barrel into the left arm pit of theGet back! For Chrissakes! The KID doesn't understand... He clambers onto the roof before MAX can grab him. The tanker shudders again as another tyre is blown out.
