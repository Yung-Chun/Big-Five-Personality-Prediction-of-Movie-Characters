She desires freedom, but only true love can break the spell.Her wish is granted in the form of a prince.But before he can declare his love, her lustful twin, the Black Swan, tricks and seduces him.Devastated, the White Swan leaps off a cliff, killing herself. But, in death, finds freedom.Good morning, company.We open our season with Swan Lake. Done to death, I know. But not like this. We strip it down. Make it visceral and real.And a new production needs a new Swan Queen. A fresh face to present to the world.But which of you can embody both swans? The white and the black?All the soloists I touched... Please go to your scheduled rehearsals this afternoon.And the girls I didn't touch, meet me in studio B at five.So Nina, would you like to be the Swan Queen?Well, if I was just casting the White Swan, she'd be yours.But I'm not.Maestro, Odile's Coda.Show me your Black Swan, Nina.Come on, not so controlled.Seduce us! Not just the Prince, but the court, the audience, the entire world! The fouettes are like a spider spinning her web. Come on! Attack it! Attack it!Good of you to join us.Girls, this is Lily. Straight off the plane from San Francisco. She's filling Rebecca's old spot.Go on, get warmed up.I've seen enough. Thank you, Nina.Okay, Veronica. Your turn. The White Swan's variation...Yes, Nina?Now's fine, what is it?How thrilling for you.Okay, Nina, listen, I honestly don't care about your technique, you should know that by now.Anyway, I've already chosen Veronica, so...You're not going to try and change my mind?You must have thought it was possible, coming to find me like this.Why are you here? All dolled up?That all?Truth is, when I look at you, all I see is the White Swan. Yes, you're beautiful, fragile, fearful. Ideal casting. But the Black Swan...it's a hard fucking job to dance both.Really? She's hungry, volatile. In four years, every time you dance, I see you obsess over getting each move exactly right, but I never see you lose yourself.All that discipline, for what?Perfection's not just about control. It's also about letting go. Surprising the audience. Surprising yourself. Transcendence.Very few have it in them.Ow! Fuck!You bit me.I can't believe it. That fucking hurt.Okay!Okay, Nina. Very good.But I knew the White Swan wouldn't be a problem. The real work will be your metamorphosis into the Black Swan.I saw a flash of her yesterday. Get ready to show me more of that bite.Watch the way she moves...Imprecise, but sensual. She's not faking it. Pay attention.Ready to be thrown to the wolves? We need their cash, so smile.Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.As I stand here tonight, I see so many familiar faces. Your contribution to the art we all cherish profoundly goes straight to my heart and I am very grateful.Let me begin with a very important announcement. You all have had the chance to be enchanted, transported, sometimes devastated by the performances of this true artist of our company. She has been an exceptional inspiration to my work, a role model to our dancers and a deeply satisfying presence on our stage. You all know who I am talking about...Beth MacintyreAs we all know, every great career comes to an end. Beth is retiring at the end of the season. She will be giving her farewell performance as Melpomene, the role she originated in my first ballet.She will be greatly missed, but she will always be remembered. My little princess.But as we bid adieu to one star, we welcome another!As you know, we open our season with my new version of Swan Lake. Taking the role of our new Swan Queen is the exquisite Ms. Nina Sayers.Soon you will have the pleasure of seeing her perform, tonight we raise a glass. To all of you, to Nina, to Beth, to beauty!Dr. Brinson and his lovely wife, Ellen, tonight's sponsors.And this is Mr. and Mrs. Stein.Relax, you're doing great.Ah, there you are.You did well.They tried to eat you alive, but here you are, in one piece.I'll get you a cab. Where you going?Why don't you come to my place first? It's on the way.For a drink. Unless you've had enough.A minute more of ass-kissing. Wait here.What's going on?You're drunk. You should go home.Poor, poor little princess. Try to hold it together.Come on.Here.I thought it'd be good to talk about the role. Ground us a little.The better we get to know each other, the more productive we'll be. I don't want there to be any boundaries between us.Good. So, do you have a boyfriend?Have you had many in the past?You're not a virgin, are you?Then there's nothing to be embarrassed about, is there? And you enjoy making love?Sex. Do you enjoy it?We need to be able to talk about this.So?I have a homework assignment for you.Go home and masturbate. Live a little.It's late. Lots of work tomorrow. The doorman will find you a cab.She walked into the street, got hit by a car.I'm sure she did it on purpose.Everything Beth ever did came from within. From some dark impulse. It's what could make her so thrilling to watch. Even perfect at times. But also destructive.It's not your problem. This has nothing to do with you.Nina, don't let yourself be distracted. Dance is not immortalized like music, poetry or art. It lives for now. For this moment only. And this is your moment.No, no, not so stiff. Don't be scared of him.Forget about control. I want to see passion.Let it out!David, answer me this question: are you interested in fucking her?No, of course not. No one would be.Nina, your Black Swan still looks no different than your White Swan. She's's just as...frigid.Fuck!Hey! We're still working in here. Lights back on.Thank you! Okay, you guys can go. Thank you for your patience. You stay.I'll be the Prince.Use each finger, your face, your tits, everything. Entice me!Just feel my touch and respond.Slow down. Open your mouth.Open it.That was me seducing you. It needs to be the other way around.Try it again.Again.Again.No.Lily talked to me. Said she saw you crying.She said you were upset and I should \"take it easy\" on you.Maybe you'd like a break for a day or two.Or a fucking month.I don't care! You shouldn't be whining to her!You could be brilliant. Taking it easy would be a betrayal.Stop saying that! Stop being so damn weak!Keep going. Let's finish the Act.That was good. Let's take 10, then we'll move on to Act 4.Get warmed up.The Black Swan has stolen your love. There's only one way to end the pain.You're not at all fearful. Filled with acceptance.You look at the Prince, then down at Rothbart, and, yes, up at the audience...And jump!Go ahead. You'll be fine.Everybody get a drink then it's notes.At last, I saw the Black Swan.(to stage manager,What's going on? 77-78C.There's always an alternate, you know that. Lily's the best choice.Every dancer in the world wants your role.Nina...Listen, I know it's been a struggle. But you had a breakthrough this morning.Tomorrow is yours. Give a great performance, and you won't have to worry about Lily, or anyone else.No more. Go home and rest.Nina?Lily, give us a minute.Are you okay?Nina?Nina!I already asked Lily-The only person standing in your way is you. It's time to let her go. Lose yourself.What a fucking disaster!Get back out there! Get back-Listen to them! They love you! Get up, get up!I always knew you had it in you, little princess.
