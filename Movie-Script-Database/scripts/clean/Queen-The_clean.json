Not the actual ticking of the box, although, I suppose, it would be nice to experience that ONCE. But the sheer joy of being partial.No.Yes.I suppose that is some consolation.Did you stay up?And? Was it as expected..?I see.To BE, Robin. Prime Minister to BE.He's a hard one to read, isn't he?Well, we'll try not to hold that against him.Oh. Is he going to `modernise' us, do you think?I don't measure the depth of a curtsey, Robin. I leave that to my sister.What? As in `Call me Tony?'Oh. I'm not sure I like the sound of that. Have we sent him a protocol sheet?ongratulations.Your children must be very proud.You've three, haven't you?How lovely. Such a blessing. Children.So..Have we shown you how to start a nuclear war yet?First thing we do, I believe. a beat) Then we take your passport and spend the rest of the time sending you around the world.Well, you are my tenth Prime Minister, Mr Blair. I'd like to think there weren't too many surprises left. My first was Winston Churchill. He sat in your chair, in frock coat and top hat, and was kind enough to give a shy young girl like me quite an education.ith time, one has hopefully added experience to that education, and a little wisdom - better enabling us to execute our constitutional responsibility. To advise, guide and warn the government of the day.ell, we will save that for our weekly meetings. a beat) Now, if there's nothing else, I believe we have some business to attend to..No, no, no. It's usual for ME to ask the questions.Mr Blair, the people have elected you to be their leader. And so the duty falls on me, as your Sovereign, to ask you to become Prime Minister, and form a government in my name.Generally, this is where you say `yes.'And exhausted, I imagine. Where will you be spending the summer?How lovely.Yes, I can hardly wait. Wonderful place.My great, great grandmother said of it - \"In Balmoral all seems to breathe freedom and peace and to make one forget the world and its sad turmoils.\"Not too short, was it? I gave him fifteen minutes. One doesn't want to be rude.Oh..ou know what she's like.It's quite awful... What are you going to do about the boys?Yes that's sensible.What? A private one?Isn't that precisely the sort of extravagance they attack us for?Out of the question. It's not a matter of State.Diana is no longer an HRH, nor a member of the Royal Family. This is a private matter.All right.I don't want the boys to see the news and get upset. First thing tomorrow morning, I want the radio taken out of their bedroom, and the television taken out of the nursery.Ye-es.hope you told her to come back? Cut the holiday short?an't imagine she was pleased.What did she say?Just make sure the boys never hear you talk like that.No. I'm going to do my diary a little longer.Thank you, Robin. I'll take it next door. he QUEEN gets to her feet and walks out into..Thank you.Certainly not.No member of the Royal family will speak publicly about this. It is a private matter and we would all appreciate it if it could be respected as such.We've spoken to the Spencer family, and it's their wish.. ..their express wish, that it should be a private funeral. With a memorial service to follow in a month, or so.Given that Diana was no longer a member of the Royal Family we have no choice but to respect their wishes.As I said. That's the Spencers' wish.hance to what..?It's a family funeral, Mr. Blair. Not a fairground attraction. I think the Princess has already paid a high enough price for exposure to the press, don't you?The Chaplain called. Wanted to know whether he should make any changes to the service or make special mention of Diana.I told him he shouldn't change a thing.I think the less fuss one makes, or draws attention to it, the better. she lowers her voice, as the PRINCES approach from the saloon with CHARLES) For the boys.And we should probably arrange some company for them. Some young people.Good. They'd like that.Have we heard from the Spencers again? Have they made up their minds when the funeral will be?What? Stalking?I'm sorry, I can't bear it. gets to her feet) I'm going to bed.What can we do for you, Robin?About the funeral arrangements, yes.I see.nd what form will it take?What..?I see..Oh.Yes, of course..hat flowers?Fine. Then move them away.Ye-es. Of course. chastened) Quite right.Up at Craigghead.Certainly not.What for? It's perfectly all right.What? And expose them to the media? It would have been a dreadful thing to do. They're much better off here.Especially whenever a photographer was in sight.Not `us', dear.Why don't you go on without me? I'm going to walk back..Yes. It looks like rain.. And I'm not in the mood for stalking anyway.Wait! My shoe-lace is undone. You don't want me to trip and hurt myself, do you? a beat) You wouldn't get any proper walks then.Right. Done. Now who knows the way home?You clever things!I spoke to Charles this afternoon.Who was good enough to share with me his views on motherhood.How wonderful Diana was.What a natural.Maybe he's got a point. Maybe we are partly to blame.No, wait. Leave it.We encouraged the match. And signed off on it. Both of us. a beat) You were very enthusiastic, remember.Is it?Those fire-lighters no good? carrying tupperware boxes) I brought some stew just in case. I think it's lamb. We could always have that cold..Robin had a call from the Prime Minister. Who expressed his concern.The flag above Buckingham Palace. He thinks it should be flying at half- mast.That's not the point.\"What about the Union Jack?\", was Mr. Blair's next suggestion.Like those condolence books.What..?Good.No, I'd better take it.Prime Minister?We've managed to look at one or two, yes.So what would you suggest, Prime Minister? Some kind of statement?THEIR grief?If you're suggesting that I drop everything and come down to London before I attend to two boys that have just lost their mother..you're mistaken.I doubt there are many who know the British more than I do, Mr. Blair, nor who has greater faith in their wisdom and judgement. And it is my belief that they will soon reject this `mood' which has been stirred up by the press...in favour of a period of restrained grief, and sober, private mourning. a beat) That's the way we do things in this country. Quietly. With dignity. It's what the rest of the world has always admired us for.Yes. could hardly be less enthusiastic) Let's.Oh..Oh, you are stupid.Hello? Could you put me through to the Ghillies' office? listens) ello, Thomas? I'm afraid I've done something very foolish. I think I've broken the prop-shaft. Crossing the river.Yes, perfectly. The front one, not the rear. I've lost the four-wheel drive. You forget I worked as a mechanic in the war.Yes, perfectly, thank you. I'm so sorry to waste your time..Oh, will you? You are kind. Thank you. a beat) I'll wait by the car.Oh, you are a beauty.How are the boys?Oh, no..No.All right. I'll take it here. a beat) In the kitchens.ood morning, Prime Minister.Yes, I have.Is Queen Elizabeth up yet?Mummy?One - lower the flag to half-mast above Buckingham Palace and all other Royal residences. Two - leave Balmoral, and fly down to London at the earliest opportunity. Three - pay respects in person at Diana's coffin. And four - make a statement via live television to my people and the world.I have.To him too.Something's happened. There's been a change...a shift of values..\"I declare that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service.\"But if my actions are damaging the crown?Mummy..It's just no one seems to value tradition or constancy any more. It's all about show. About wearing your heart on your sleeve.Yes. They left for London after breakfast. With Charles.Yes, but further discussion is no longer helpful either.What?Really..?No, no..please don't disturb him. I've come on another matter. I hope you don't mind..e was wounded.voice cracks) Let's hope he didn't suffer too much.Yes, Robin..Thank you.Oh..hello.Oh.For me..?Right.Do I have a choice?RightI see.Since last Saturday's dreadful news we have seen, throughout Britain and the world, an overwhelming expression of sadness at Diana's death..We have all been trying in our different ways to cope. The initial shock is often succeeded by a mixture of other feelings. Disbelief, incomprehension, anger and concern for those who remain.We have all felt these emotions in these last few days. So what I say to you now, as your Queen and as a grandmother, I say from my heart...I hope that tomorrow we can all, wherever we are, join in expressing our grief at Diana's loss, and gratitude for her all-too-short life.Do sit down.Whatever for?Not at all.I don't think I shall ever understand what happened this summer.ou're confusing humility with humiliation.You didn't hear what they were saying in the Mall that Friday.And an even better one for you, Mr Blair.Really?You don't feel that what respect or affection people might once have had for....this institution has been diminished?I gather some of your closest advisors were less fulsome in their support..You're very kind.But let's also not forget the more pragmatic reason.That without me there to distract everyone, it'd suddenly become embarrassingly clear how much unchecked power the British Prime Minister actually has.If fifty years of doing MY job has taught me anything, it is that the people doing YOURS generally prefer me with all my faults to some kind of meddling President.. Just look at the French.Good. The clocks go back next week, then it'll be dark by five.As a matter of fact, it's how I think best. On my feet. I've never been one for sitting around endlessly. A good walk and fresh air sorts everything out..One in four, you said? Wanted to get rid of me? TI've never been hated like that before.It was. Very.Ever since Diana people want glamour and tears..the grand performance..and I'm not very good at that. I prefer to keep my feelings to myself. Foolishly I believed that's what people wanted from their Queen. Not to make a fuss nor wear one's heart on one's sleeve, duty first... self second.It's how I was brought up. It's all I've ever knownI was. A girl.But I can see the world has changed. And one must 'modernise'.Don't get ahead of yourself Prime- minister, I think you'll find that I'm supposed to be advising YOU!So...what might we expect in your first Parliament?", "clean_line":

He's married to a woman with known anti- Monarchist sympathies - you may remember her curtsey the first time you met. It could best be described as `shallow'.And I spoke to the Cabinet Secretary who said he was expecting the atmosphere at Downing Street to be very informal. Everyone on first name terms.

One other thing. The Police Commissioner was keen that you consider the idea of a condolence book. It would give the growing crowds something to do. Make marshalling them easier.Oh, and the flowers.Actually, the Lord Chamberlain was wondering whether we shouldn't leave the flowers, and send the Guards through the North Gate.Right, we'd better have a look at these papers.God..Right...Yes, Ma'am.

The situation has become quite critical.Ma'am, a poll that's to be published in tomorrow's paper suggests 70% of people believe your actions have damaged the monarchy and one in four are now in favour of abolishing the monarchy altogether.As your Prime Minister, I believe it's my constitutional responsibility to ADVISE the following..Thank God for that.Be right there.I'm the Prime Minister.

Because she's struggling to lead the world in mourning for a woman who threw everything she offered back in her face, and who seemed, in the last few years, to be committed twenty-four seven to destroy everything she holds dear.That's not the point.

And in the end, you showed great personal strength, courage, and humility. EThat's not true.I still believe History will show it was a good week for you.But there are fifty-two weeks in a year, Ma'am. And two and a half thousand in a half century.And when people come to assess your legacy, no one will remember those few days.Not at all.One or two. But as a leader one has...a different perspective. a beat) I could never have added my voice to the chorus.Which is?I am.For about half an hour. But then you came down to London and all that went away.No. And that must have been difficult.One forgets.
