It's not been touched.Look at this.I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.We'll sell it. Sell everything.He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.You don't like it?You're still blaming me.You wanted to come back to London. We came back.So what's the argument?Oh Christ. Julia ...Shit.I hear you.Where are you?Frank.He's been here.
