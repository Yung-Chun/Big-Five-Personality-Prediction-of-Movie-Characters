{"Arcade": {"ALEX": {"raw_line": "Time. That's all I ever think about anymore. It's like there's never enough of it, you know?It's strange. When the future's in front of you, it seems to go on forever. I mean, you never really get there. It's always one step ahead of you. It's like there's no present. There's no \"now\". As soon as you think, \"I'm here\", the moment's already gone. Either everything's in the future, or it's in the past. There's no \"now\".I'm in the past.That's okay. I've got a test coming up anyway. Gotta study.Killed herself?He's a basket case. You've talked to him. You know that. He might as well be dead too.Look Mr. Weaver, I don't even know why I came here. I fine. Really. It's like I said. It's just part of the past now. It doesn't matter anymore.He thinks I'm \"sublimating\".I know.I'm okay.And then keep on driving?It's okay, Mr. Finster...Go for it.Where's Greg?Where's Greg?Has anyone seen Greg?So where is he?Yeah...But he was playing the game. I mean, you saw him...Fuck-you.Dad...Dad...Did Greg call, Dad?You should go to bed, Dad.Yeah.How ...Where's Greg?Screamer.Hello?Nick...Listen to me! Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.I have to talk to you.No, in person. Now.I'm coming over.Shit...Okay...don't think about it... Okay.Funny.What's that?Something weird's happening.Greg never came home. A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.Can you turn off the game?Turn if off!No. Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway... I think the game's alive somehow.No, wait. Just listen. I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name. As soon as I turned it on, Nick. It said my name. How could it know? And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, \"In here\".It is.So how did it know my name, then?See, men always do this. \"Quiet down, honey. Chill out. Take a Valium\". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick! I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!There!It turned itself back on, Nick.It's alive, Nick. It's listening to us ...Call the others. Laurie, Benz...Something's happened to them.All of them?Because I didn't know where else to go.Sure.If I were you, I'd think twice about playing that game again.Well? Where are the others?Everybody's sick, huh? It's fifteen after. We always meet here, you know that.Did you play ARCADE last night?You want to hear something else, Nick? I tried to call them this morning...Greg, Benz, Laurie... Their phones are out of order.And then I started thinking...about everyone else that was at Dante's yesterday. I drew up this list. DeLoach, those other jerks ... their phones are out of order too.We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...If they're sick, great. But let's make sure. Come on, Nick.And don't watch any television.She thought Benz was at school.Laurie's.Come on.Laurie...answer...come on...Shit.This is like a movie or something. I mean, am I paranoid or what?Let's go around back.She's here!It is the game.Laurie!LAURIE!Nick, what do we do?!Laurie...wake up...We have to turn it off, Laurie. I'm turning it off...Change the channel!Oh God... He's in the cable system! He's out of the game!Laurie...We can't...Where do we go?Meet you by the car.What?Nick, what is it.Like the fractals?...but then it hits the relay stations...Anywhere. We have to stop it from getting out.The Police, then...Then where do we go?!SLIP-STREAM.They made ARCADE. It's still a game, right? It thinks like a game. Maybe it still has to play by the rules. Someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?.And beat it at it's own game.I was afraid you'd say that.We need to see Mr. Difford.Why thank-you.Virgin sacrifices?How'd you know it was us?It's the game, ARCADE.Neither are we. Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...No I'm not...We're having some problems with ARCADE...We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...What's the question mark?How do you do that?But how can it change every time?Dead?Maybe he's not dead.The donor. Maybe he's alive inside the game.What are you going to do?I can't believe you made it!You got the schematics?So where do we play the game, Nick?Dante's Inferno.The windows are barred... There's a skylight. We can get in through the roof.Nick... Nick!Are you there?You didn't hear me?Stop looking at it.Oh God...What are you looking for?Is the game plugged in?Put in a quarter.Yes it does. Don't you see? We have to play by the rules. That's what it wants.Two players, Nick. You need to put in another quarter.Yes I am...And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!I'm going.What?I already have a boyfriend, Nick.Fuck-you.We know what you are.You feel it? It's different this time.One. In case...Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.Got it.You've got the schematics, check.The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level. Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...The clock's already ticking.There...It only looks like it leads to nowhere.Yeah, that's what worries me.There...Check your read-out.There's another...Our time's up.Look around...Screamer.Nick! It's beneath the water! We have to swim!We don't have a choice!One of them, anyway... Did you see it? The Screamer?There never is.Never been on a snowboard.I guess we're walking from here on out.Time's up.Get up, Nick...GET UP!!!It's Benz!!!Benz!Run! RUN!!!Fuck you.Guys! Oh my God...Laurie? Stilts?What did he do to you?Wait! No! That's not it!Think! I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which? The liar...think!I'm thinking!The liar...Truth Teller...liar...liar...Liar. Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?But you always lie, so you didn't come from there. That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth.Take me to the city on the left!Grab my hand!How did you get here? Did you play the game?!Thought so.Can you hang onto my back?There's a monster here. We have to kill it before we can leave. That's what we have to do. I know it's scary, but I won't let anything happen to you. Okay?Then we'll go home.Here goes everything.Which way?Sorry.In this world, wrong is right!Oh God...oh god...Shit!!!SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Okay. I'm here, ARCADE. Where are you?Where are you, damnit?!You...you're ARCADE? But the donor...No! NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I'm in the past.No ... oh no ...Mom? You're alive...But I don't understand...Yes...but...how did you...Is...is that where we are? Did I die?Guess what, ass-hole? You forgot about my free life!!!Greg!!!Well, it's a long story...I just thought of something. If we came back from the game... ...what if ARCADE did too?Okay.

What're you going to do when you get out of here?You making another one, Greg?Shit. I'm out.That's the new Slip-Stream game. Those guys are good. It's supposed to be interactive. Graphics are unbelievable.I'm game... Greg?Super computers, micro-processors... That's the future we're looking at.So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.That's impossible.\"Escape\"?The best.So what's the scenario? Am I saving a princess? Fighting Zombies?So how do I start?Nick.You gotta try this thing.Sign me up.Yeah, outside.Guess he took off... You have his keys, right?Hmmm. He said you were going to have dinner?So take his car home. Wait. I'm sure he's up to something...It's nothing, okay? Just take his car home. He'll show up.Don't worry about it.Hey, kid.Have you played the game yet? It's incredible! I was just...What the hell are you talking about?You there? Hello?We are talking...It's twelve-thirty!Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this.Isn't it amazing? It's a sort of rest position in the game, when you're between levels.They're fractals. Visual representations of mathematic equations. The game is totally brilliant. I mean, look at it, it's like a DNA molecule or something...What do you mean by \"weird\"?I'm in the middle of it...Happy?Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that. And maybe he's in trouble. But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...How?! It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think. They're not alive. It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.You imagined it.Quiet. I do have parents, you know.No it didn't. It's just a faulty relay or something. It happens.Just shut up! Enough already, okay?Sorry. Maybe I need the Valium.I'll try Stilts. He's got insomnia.Okay...Laurie, then.Benz...It's the middle of the night. They're asleep. Phone didn't wake them.Look, why are you fucking with me like this?It's two o'clock in the morning. Go home. Go to sleep. We'll figure something out in the morning.It's not this weird. It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?So what do you want me to do?No way.Okay. We'll see what's up. But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this. Life's too short, know what I mean?Just stay here, Stilts.Just do what she says, Stilts. And if we're not back...Look at me, Stilts. Am I laughing?Just do what she said. Don't watch television.Well?Where to now?It doesn't necessarily mean she's...No, Alex! Alex, wait a minute...What is it?See what?Jesus Christ!What?!Who are you?!Is she breathing?Then leave her.We'll call 911. Look around Alex. We broke in, smashed the t.v., no one's going to believe what happened here!I believe you now. I don't know what the fuck just happened, but it did. Now let's get the hell out of here.My house. I want to try something.Around back.I'm not taking any chances.Okay. I'm going inside. If I'm not back out in, say, two minutes, you get the hell out of here.We need to find a pay-phone.That's what I thought.It's not just the cable system. It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net. It's everywhere.Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence. It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something. It's self-replicating...it mimics life.It's growing. Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...Right. And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.It's already out.Give me a break, Alex. What are we going to tell them? Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines. I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...I don't know.What?You mean we learn the rules...You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.No, but it's important and if you'd...If Difford's not out here it one minute we're calling the news and informing them that your fucking games are whispering in our ears and telling us to commit suicide. I'm talking public relations nightmare here, buddy. Satanism, virgin sacrifices, backward messages, the whole bit.Drives 'em crazy every time.That's gotta be the understatement of the century. It's killing people.What Alex is trying to say is that it \"seems\" like it's alive.We're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff... I mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right?The Air-Force is working on the same thing.Does that thing work?What do you mean?How do you stop The Screamer?What's the riddle?Just tell me the fucking riddle.How the hell did you do that?Could you play ARCADE with that?Thanks, Albert. Think you could print up those schematics?Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?Get that helmet. If we're going to play ARCADE, I want every advantage possible.Thanks again.Shit...Jesus Christ!Everything.I've been thinking about that. ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started. You know, like his point of origin?Yeah. The Inferno.Okay, your turn.Alex...Shit...it's like a trance or something... Okay. I'm fine. Really.Put it out of your head, Alex. It's just trying to psyche us out.A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...There. Now we're wired in.I don't understand. It wants us to play the game. It's been taunting us ...It can turn itself on, Alex! It doesn't need a quarter.Change machine.There.You're not coming, Alex.I know how to do this! I'm good at these games. You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.No. If you're smart, you run like hell.You don't get it, do you?I don't want anything to happen to you. I care about you.I know. It sucks.What can I say? Tough being a hero, isn't it?Here goes nothing.Hold on!We're actually inside, aren't we?Okay. Give us a kiss?Don't even say it.Thanks. Always wanted to do that.That's what I was hoping you'd say.I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats. You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.You steer by pivoting your back foot... Okay?Which way do you think Level Two is?Oh shit! What if they didn't come with us?!Okay. It's West....and then we go to the Final Level. Hey, don't worry about it. It's a game. How bad could it be?Right, then...I don't get it. This is supposed to be the end of the level, but it doesn't go anywhere.And we've still got time left. This was a piece of cake.Hey, my strength's low. Look out for Fireflies.Shit...You're right. It worked.According to this, the doorway should be somewhere around here...What?! There's nothing here!I don't see the doorway!What the fuck is that?!We can't reach that!So that's what we almost died for?I don't want to talk about it.Christ...no time...We can take the dunes down like a ski slope.
