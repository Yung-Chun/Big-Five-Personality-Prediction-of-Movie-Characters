{"Predator": {"SCHAEFER": {"raw_line": "It's been a long time, General.That's over the border, General.What have you got in mind, General.What else it new? When do we leave?What's that, General?You know we don't work with outsiders, General.Dillon, you son of a bitch.You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?You never did know when to quit.Like the old days, Dillon.Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins. This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?Go on.And nothing we can't handle alone.Who's our back-up on this?This gets better by the minute.You never were all that smart...let's go!!!Took 'em out with a heat seeker.Mmmnnn...?Billy's on it. Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.What do you mean?Mean anything to you?Get ahead, see what you can find. Slow and easy.J.S. Davis, Captain, U.S. Army...Mac. Cut them down.I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?Well somebody sent them.What happened here, Billy?I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.What about the rest of Hopper's men?Stick with the guerilla trail. Let's get it over with. We move. Five meter spread. No sound. Nothing.Just killed one of the * prisoners. No time for * invitations. We take them, now.Stick around.Down!!!Hawk, Get Con. Op. on the hook! Position and situation, now!Any sign of the hostages?Good work, Mac. Clear the area, no traces. Get the men ready to move.Shit...I think this is the one you want.It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start...you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.Why us?What story did you give to Davis?That's your problem, Dillon. You always did put ambition before the lives of your men. My men are not expendable. I don't do this kind of work. This is your dirty little war, not mine.Movement?How much time?Tell Mac we move in five.We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.I'm getting my men out of this damn jungle, Dillon. She's your baggage. You fall behind, you're on your own.This place is too hot for a pick-up. They won't touch us until we're over the border. We can lift at LZ 49, here. Spotter plane says we're cut off. Except for this valley.Not much choice. Pancho, take the lead. Double time it.Lock n' load, watch your ass.What's got Billy so spooked?What is it...?Billy...What the hell's wrong with you?It's...nothing...What do you think...?It's not her blood.Hawkins?What in God's name...?Where the hell is his body?Ramirez, ask her what happened.Why didn't they take the radio and his weapon? Why didn't she escape?I want him found. Sweep pattern and double back. Fifty meters.You saw what?Blain... ...Just like the others...no powder burns, no shrapnel....Mac!Mac! Mac! Look at me!Mac, who did this?We're losing the light. Mac, I want a defensive position above this ridge, mined with everything we're got.Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.Thank you, Sergeant.I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.You still don't get it, do you Dillon? He took Davis... and now he wants us.Get a field dressing on that right away.Where's the girl?He knows our defenses. *He came back for the body. He's killing us, one at a time...He uses the trees. *Yesterday. What did you see?No more games.Go on.What's you name?Anna. He's hunting us. You know that?We're going to need everyone. *We're not going. *Dillon...This thing doesn't * care who we are, who she is. We make a stand or there won't * be anyone left to make that * chopper.If it bleeds, we can kill it.He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.You're catching on, Dillon.Mac!Get Ramirez on his feet! Take the girl and get the hell out of here!This isn't your style, Dillon.You know you can't win this one.Dillon!I'll see you there.Come on, Poncho, we're getting out of here. Billy, take the radio, leave the rest. Come on!Billy!!!Billy!!!Get back, into the rocks!Run! Get to the chopper!You couldn't see me.One chance, that's all.Anna...?Anna...?Bleed, you bastard.Who the hell are you...?", "clean_line": "long time general border general got mind general new leave general know work outsiders general dillon son bitch ve pushing pencils dillon know quit like old days dillon wasn style rescue unit assassins good big shot cia leaves desk come bush important handle gets better minute smart let took em heat seeker mmmnnn billy heat seeker pretty sophisticated half asses mountain boys mean mean ahead slow easy davis captain army mac cut knew man green berets fort bragg hell got answers dillon somebody sent happened billy believe jim hopper walked ambush rest hopper men stick guerilla trail let meter spread sound killed prisoners time invitations stick hawk op hook position situation sign hostages good work mac clear area traces men ready shit think want bullshit start set got dirty work story davis problem dillon ambition lives men men expendable kind work dirty little war movement time tell mac ll away position chance gets prisoners dillon getting men damn jungle dillon baggage fall place hot pick won touch border lift lz spotter plane says cut valley choice pancho lead double time lock load watch ass got billy spooked billy hell wrong think blood hawkins god hell body ramirez ask happened radio weapon escape want sweep pattern double meters saw blain like powder burns shrapnel mac mac mac look mac losing light mac want defensive position ridge mined got poncho liner carry ll bury morning thank sergeant sorry bull easy good soldier expendable assets dillon langley need bullshit like rest dillon took davis wants field dressing right away girl knows defenses came body killing time uses trees yesterday games anna hunting know going need going dillon thing care stand won left chopper bleeds kill ll looking trip wires lucky won catching dillon mac ramirez feet girl hell isn style dillon know win dillon ll come poncho getting billy radio leave rest come billy billy rocks run chopper couldn chance anna anna bleed bastard hell"}}}
