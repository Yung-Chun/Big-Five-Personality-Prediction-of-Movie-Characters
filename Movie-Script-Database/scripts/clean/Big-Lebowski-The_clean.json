Well, it's water under the bridge. And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?Am I wrong!Okay then. We play Quintana and O'Brien next week. They'll be pushovers.That's your answer to everything, Dude. And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.I'm perfectly calm, Dude.Calmer than you are.Calmer than you are.Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.The man is a sex offender. With a record. Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.Shut the fuck up, Donny.Anyway. How much they offer you?Just for making the hand-off?What if it's during a game?Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.Huh?That...fucking...bitch!That fucking bitch!Shut the fuck up, Donny! V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!That's fucking exactly what happened, Dude! That makes me fucking SICK!Those rich fucks! This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.Have it your way. The point is--The fucking point is--Eight-year-olds, Dude.Take the ringer. I'll drive.The ringer! The ringer, Dude! Have they called yet?My dirty undies. Laundry, Dude. The whites.Thaaaat's right, Dude. The weight. The ringer can't look empty.Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking. I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million. Am I wrong?It is a fucking game. You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--Dude, are you fucking this up?What the fuck is going on there?Easy, Dude.Dude, nothing is fucked. Come on. You're being very unDude. They'll call back. Look, she kidnapped her--Ya see? Nothing is fucked up here, Dude. Nothing is fucked. These guys are fucking amateurs--Okay Dude. Have it your way.But they're amateurs.Yeah. So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.That's the simple part, Dude. When we make the handoff, I grab the guy and beat it out of him....Huh?Thaaat's right, Dude. The beauty of this is its simplicity. If the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong. If there's one thing I learned in Nam--What'd he say? Where's the hand- off?Huh?We can't do that, Dude. That fucks up our plan.Wooden bridge, huh?The bridge is coming up! Gimme the ringer, Dude! Chop-chop!Okay, Dude. No time to argue. Here's the bridge--Your wheel, Dude! I'm rolling out!Your wheel! At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out! I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him! The uzi!You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!Fifteen! This is it, Dude! Let's take that hill!Ahh fuck it, let's go bowling.Aitz chaim he, Dude. As the ex used to say.Huh? Oh, him, yeah. Well I don't see, um-- what exactly is the problem?What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude. You said so yourself--That's right, Dude, 1 % certain--Donny, shut the f--when do we play?Saturday! Well they'll have to reschedule.I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--I'm shomer shabbas.Saturday is shabbas. Jewish day of rest. Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!Shomer shabbas.For Christ's sake, Dude.Went alright. Dude's car got a little dinged up--Yeah yeah, \"kill that poor woman.\"Kill that poor woman.Really, Dude, you surprise me. They're not gonna kill shit. They're not gonna do shit. What can they do? Fuckin' amateurs. And meanwhile, look at the bottom line. Who's sitting on a million fucking dollars? Am I wrong?Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?And what do they got, Dude? My dirty undies. My fucking whites--Say, where is the car?Where's your car, Dude?Hmm. Well, we were in a handicapped spot. It, uh, it was probably towed.Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--That wasn't her toe.How the fuck should I know? I do know that nothing about it indicates--Fine, Dude. As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--You want a toe? I can get you a toe, believe me. There are ways, Dude. You don't wanna know about it, believe me.I'll get you a toe by this afternoon--with nail polish. These fucking amateurs. They send us a toe, we're supposed to shit our- selves with fear. Jesus Christ. My point is--Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude. So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!Oh, please dear! I've got news for you: the Supreme Court has roundly rejected prior restraint!Lady, I got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!Don't run away from this, Dude! Goddamnit, this affects all of us!Our basic freedoms!I'm staying. Finishing my coffee.Finishing my coffee.Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.Now that is ridiculous, Dude. No one is going to cut your dick off.Not if I have anything to say about it.Dude--Now Dude--Fucking Germans. Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!Are you gonna split hairs?Am I wrong?Huh?Nihilists! Jesus.And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.No, I'm----We're sympathizing here, Dude--You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--Fuck the tournament?!Okay Dude. I can see you don't want to be cheered up. C'mon Donny, let's go get a lane.He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--Near the In-and-Out Burger--Shut the fuck up, Donny. This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is--are you ready for this?-- Arthur Digby Sellers.Huh?Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?All but one man died? There at Bitter Creek?Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.The bulk of the series.Not exactly a lightweight.And yet his son is a fucking dunce.Yeah, go figure. Well we'll go out there after the, uh, the.What have you. We'll, uh--Shut the fuck up, Donny. We'll, uh, brace the kid--he'll be a pushover. We'll get that fucking money, if he hasn't spent it already. Million fucking clams. And yes, we'll be near the, uh--some burgers, some beers, a few laughs. Our fucking troubles are over, Dude.Hardly Dude, a new 'vette? The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options. Wait in the car, Donny.Hello, Pilar? My name is Walter Sobchak, we spoke on the phone, this is my associate Jeffrey Lebowski.May we uh, we wanted to talk about little Larry. May we come in?That's him, Dude.Thank you, ma'am.Does he, uh. . . Is he still writing?Uh-huh.I just want to say, sir, that we're both enormous--on a personal level, Branded, especially the early episodes, has been a source of, uh, inspir---No ma'am, I didn't mean to give the impression that we're police exactly. We're hoping that it will not be necessary to call the police.But that is up to little Larry here. Isn't it, Larry?Is this your homework, Larry?Is this your homework, Larry?Dude, please!. . . Is this your homework, Larry?Is this yours, Larry? Is this your homework, Larry?Is this your homework, Larry?Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?You're going to enter a world of pain, son. We know that this is your homework. We know you stole a car--And the fucking money. And we know that this is your homework, Larry.You're gonna KILL your FATHER, Larry!.Ah, this is pointless.All right, Plan B. You might want to watch out the front window there, Larry.This is what happens when you FUCK a STRANGER in the ASS, Larry.Fucking language problem, Dude.Maybe he'll understand this.YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS?!THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FUCK A STRANGER IN THE ASS!HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS! FUCK A STRANGER IN THE ASS!Hunh?Dude?I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.Erev shabbas. I can't drive. I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.I understand. That's why I picked up the phone.Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.What's your point, Dude?Yeah?Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--What the fuck are you talking about?What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!You know this!Yeah? What do you think happens when you get divorced? You turn in your library card? Get a new driver's license? Stop being Jewish?I'm as Jewish as fucking TevyeThree thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST! I--Jesus. What the hell happened?Jesus Christ.Jesus, Dude! He never even kidnapped her.Who'm I? I'm a fucking VETERAN!A MILLION BUCKS FROM FUCKING NEEDY LITTLE URBAN ACHIEVERS! YOU ARE SCUM, MAN!I'll tell you who I am! I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!Let me tell you something else. I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake. A fucking goldbricker.This guy fucking walks. I've never been more certain of anything in my life!Walk, you fucking phony!It's all over, man! We call your fucking bluff!Sure, I'll put him down, Dude. RAUSS! ACHTUNG, BABY!!Oh, shit.Oh, shit.Yeah, I can see that, Dude.Shit, sorry man.Shit, Dude, I didn't know. I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.Shit. He didn't look like a spinal.Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk. I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank. Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.That's fuckin' combat. The man in the black pyjamas, Dude. Worthy fuckin' adversary.Shut the fuck up, Donny. Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank. This is not a worthy--He's cracking.A tree of life, Dude. To all who cling to it.They're nihilists, Donny, nothing to be afraid of.Fuck you. Fuck the three of you.There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage. That's what ransom is. Those are the fucking rules.NO RULES! YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS- OF- BITCHES--Fair! WHO'S THE FUCKING NIHILIST HERE! WHAT ARE YOU, A BUNCH OF FUCKING CRYBABIES?!AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!They won't hurt us, Donny.

Might pass out.Rest easy, good buddy, you're doing fine. We got help choppering in.Walter Sobchak.Yeah.Yeah.What's this?Don't need it. We're scattering the ashes.This is a hundred and eighty dollars.A hundred and eighty dollars?!Yeah, but we're--We're scattering the fucking ashes!JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS!GODDAMNIT! IS THERE A RALPH'S AROUND HERE?!I'll say a few words.Donny was a good bowler, and a good man. He was. . . He was one of us. He was a man who loved the outdoors, and bowling, and as a surfer explored the beaches of southern California from Redondo to Calabassos. And he was an avid bowler. And a good friend. He died--he died as so many of his generation, before his time. In your wisdom you took him, Lord. As you took so many bright flowering young men, at Khe San and Lan Doc and Hill 364. These young men gave their lives. And Donny too. Donny who. . . who loved bowling.And so, Theodore--Donald--Karabotsos, in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been, we commit your mortal remains to the bosom of.the Pacific Ocean, which you loved so well.Goodnight, sweet prince.Shit, I'm sorry Dude.Goddamn wind.Dude!

yes. Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal. Which bothers some men. The word itself makes some men uncomfortable. Vagina.Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say. Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his \"dick\" or his \"rod\" or his \"Johnson\".Thank you.Yes, I know about it. And I know that you acted as courier. And let me tell you something: the whole thing stinks to high heaven.Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?Sex. The physical act of love. Coitus. Do you like it?You're not interested in sex?I like it too. It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word. Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.Take a look at this, sir.And you recognize her, of course.The story is ludicrous.Lord. You can imagine where it goes from here.Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey. Little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a careerLittle Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this \"abduction\", but I tell you it is preposterous. This compulsiveI'm getting to your rug. My father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you. You will receive no bill. He's a good man, and thorough.Please see him, Jeffrey. He's a good man, and thorough.Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.Do you have any news regarding my father's money?She most certainly was not!And please don't call her my mother.She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.From who?Dieter Hauff?Her \"co-star\" in the beaver picture?Dieter has been on the fringes of-- well, of everything in L.A., for about twenty years. Look at my LP's. Under 'Autobahn.'That was his group--they released one album in the mid-seventies.Huh? Autobahn. A-u-t-o. Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.Is he pretending to be the abductor?Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with. You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.So Dieter has the money?Do you still have that doctor's number?Please Jeffrey. I don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects.I want you to see him immediately.I'll see if he's available. He's a good man, and thorough.Jeffrey.Love me.Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.Uh-huh.Mmnun.Oh?Uh-huh.What do you do for fun?What happened to your house?Finder's fee?It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's. Why did he think you had it? And who does?Jeffrey--I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money. Father doesn't have any.No no, the wealth was all Mother's.We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance. He has no money of his own. I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.It increases the chances of conception.Well yes, what did you think this was all about? Fun and games?I want a child.Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.Exactly. What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?What?", "clean_line": "sense yes elfranco robe art commended strongly vaginal bothers men word makes men uncomfortable vagina yes like hearing difficult batting eye man refer dick rod johnson thank yes know know acted courier let tell thing stinks high heaven like sex mr lebowski sex physical act love coitus like interested sex like male myth feminists hate sex natural zesty enterprise unfortunately people called satyriasis men nymphomania women engage compulsively joy yes mr lebowski unfortunate souls love true sense word mutual acquaintance bunny look sir recognize course story ludicrous lord imagine goes fatuous jeffrey little matter woman chose pursue careerlittle lebowski urban achievers yes proud asked father withdrawal million dollars foundation account told abduction tell preposterous compulsivei getting rug father approve lifestyle needless approve hardly wish father embezzlement police matter proposing try recover money people delivered successfully compensate tune recovered sum thousand yes bones clams rug yes money buy number rugs sentimental value sorry crack jaw number doctor look receive good man thorough jeffrey good man thorough jeffrey haven gone doctor news father money certainly mother definitely perpetrator victim dieter hauff star beaver picture dieter fringes years look lp autobahn group released album mid seventies huh autobahn music sort ugh techno pop pretending abductor look jeffrey kidnap acquainted away hostage knows dieter money doctor number jeffrey want responsible delayed effects want immediately ll available good man thorough jeffrey love tell little jeffrey uh huh mmnun oh uh huh fun happened house finder fee father money foundation think jeffrey telling foundation money father wealth mother let father run companies briefly helps administer charities reasonable allowance money know likes present father weakness vanity slut increases chances conception yes think fun games want child look jeffrey want partner fact want father socially ll rearing child exactly happened face jackie treehorn"}}}
