That thing you caught couldn't have fertilised that egg by itself, which would mean there's a male out there big enough and strong enough to knock a hole in your bathroom wall.He says a lot of things.OK, all this is on the west side of the island, right? So that would make this area its territory; which would mean it's got to be somewhere close. Somewhere with access to the waters around the west beach.What do you think?What?You gave me that look.The \"I feel sorry for you\" look.Yeah you did.Sure that's worse!Look, I know I'm no dandy fop, Ph.

You should be laid out in a box right now, but you're not. What makes you so special?You were drunk!Come on.They're like leeches, right? They feed off your blood. Well when one of them bit Paddy, it almost died, why?Exactly. If we taint our blood with booze, we're poisonous to eat.We have just one night where we have to deal with this on our own. Tomorrow, we'll be sorted. We'll get off the island, they'll nuke the beaches or whatever they do, but all we have to worry about is tonight. And it's simple. We have a lock-in. We stay out of the rain and we drink. We can't stop them coming but we can be ready.That's just the tip of the blood sucking iceberg.No, that won't work.No, no. More like planning.Listen, the only people that know about this are us and it's gotta stay that way or we'll have a panic on our hands.This will work. And I'll keep order. I won't be drinking.Thanks. Only one of us need risk it and I know these people and this island better than you. It should be me.Lisa, I'm good to no one when I drink. I know that. So do you. I can do this.Of course you can.

There's no point going home to a cold, empty house in weather like tonight when we'll be right across the street from here and we'll have music and craic and company -- and a FREE BAR!That's the spirit! So c'mon, it's a party and the drinks are on us!Weapons. What have we got?All right, what have you got?Right, well look sharp. You know your stations: guard each exit and don't let anyone out.

GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 77.Grab the table.Brian, forget that help us barricade the door.That's gonna blow! Get rid of it!Nothing!Move back.Is every one all right?Is this what I'm like when I'm drunk?Folks, listen carefully. We're moving this party upstairs.It's just a precaution.You can't. No one can.No! You can't go outside!Paddy! Brian! Cop on, I'm asking ya! Now's not the time for this.No!Get back! Smith, what are you doing? Smith!Smith, listen to me. It's bigger than you think. Get back inside now! Please, I'm begging you.Smith, mate! Listen to me!Everyone, upstairs! Now!Everyone, stay calm. They can't get up here.Has anyone been bitten?

Has anyone got a mobile on them?Call the mainland. Call the Coastguard. Call whoever you can get through to. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 86.We'll be fine!We're the Gardai. Not the LAPD.

It can't be that hungry.Tadhg Murphy's dead!No, no, Tadhg Murphy's fine. He's at the festival on the mainland.What the hell does that mean?Grand. Ah sure what can ya do.What's your reading?What about the phones?OK, we know it does two things: it drinks blood and it breathes water.
