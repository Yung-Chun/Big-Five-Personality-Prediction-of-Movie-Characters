The guards draw their weapons, but YAZ IS FASTER.-- he launches his aliens, taking them all out. Yaz \"holsters\" the aliens and...There's nothing sexier than a girl killing for me.I'm not just a man of brute force, you know. I prefer to be known for my rapier wit-- His tongue SHOOTS OUT OF HIS MOUTH -- like a rapier -- impaling the guard----and tongue. The tongue retracts -- he and Devil Girl KISS.

That nasty, greasy thing makes your life worth living? There's people eating here, younger than that duck.The tanks in the back, Wu.Hey, save the chop socky bullshit for the locals, Wu. We need to see the kitchen.Wow, I didn't think there was anything uglier than a catfish. Jay taps on the glass -- the fish SNARLS, making Jay JUMP.Look, Wu. You can serve it to your... out of town guests, but locals get earth fish. REAL earth fish. The kind that doesn't jump out of their stomach and get everyone asking a lot of annoying questions. Like, \"Why is my lunch eating Daddy?\" You got it? DAMN, that's ugly.Something about this strike you as weird?Look at table two over there. They haven't ordered a thing. When's the last time Wu let someone sit at a table without ordering? And table five over there just drank his third cup of duck sauce. Now Kay's radar is up --Because it's about to go down. Wu, at the door, closes the blinds. He catches them looking.You probably took that whole catfish thing the wrong way -- The fish SNARLS AFTER HIM -- lunges and BITES!I was jealous, you know? Because you're so pretty! Jay BATTLES THE FISH-- throwing pots and pans in its mouth, squirting hot sauce -- working like a lion tamer to keep itKay! KAY!!! Little help! Little help!So I was thinking about making a chart for each time I save your ass. And when I do it ten times, you buy me lunch.Why? Was he the wrong guy?Yeah, well, don't worry, I think I took care of him.I make it look easy. That's the problem with being my partner.You get used to my game. It's what Dr. Phil would call taking for granted.C'mon, you know better {than anyone. What does an MiB agent call it when 12 alien species try to kill him? Tuesday. Jay laughs at his own joke. Kay just stares.Seriously, man, those noodles'll kill you before he does. I got your back.Oh, yeah? I used to play a game with my dad, too. Called catch. I'd throw the ball, and then it'd hit the house `cause he WASN'THard to badmouth someone you don't know.Tired? What -- you afraid I'm gonna take that MVP trophy away from you?Yaz... Yaz... Yaz... Where are you, Yaz...? And he FINDS IT!Here we go... Jay opens the YAZ INCIDENT REPORTAlright, Bowling Robot, do what we built you for. Reveal an incredibly high-tech robot wearing one of those white trash T-shirts that reads \"10 reasons why Bowling is better than Women.\"Guess it's on me. Jay rolls -- perfect spin -- Jay watches, willing it towards the pins -- which SCRAMBLE OUT OF THE WAY! But Jay's roll is too good -- it spins from fleeing pin to fleeing pin -- aOf course -- the one time Kay isn't here...Check it out-- The trophy raises a triumphant fist -- we realize it is in fact AN ALIEN.Look who's league MVP.I... huh?Where are you, Kay? I think you want to see this. It's the bowling MVP trophy with MY name on it. Jay works his way to his desk. Kay's already at his own adjacent desk -- bent over his work, his back to Jay.Maybe you want to think twice next time you ditch me. Kay, absorbed in work, doesn't answer.Kay?Yeah, I just wanted to show you this so I could say--You new around here?Yeah, okay, but I need the other Kay. You know, craggy old white guy... well, DIFFERENT craggy old white guy. I got you something. He hands over a \"World's Best Partner\" mug --What the HELL is going on here? Why are you pretending to be Kay?How about instead, you go find me THIS guy? Jay opens the YAZ file and pulls out a picture of KAY. But now, splashed across Kay's photo, the words:Killed? In 1969? Jay grabs the YAZ FILE -- the one he looked through last night -- but now everything is different. We see -- the incident report stating ONE CASUALTY - AGENTKay's dead? How? Why? The Men in Black Computer/Big Board sounds the alarm!Whoa, what's everyone freaking out about? We had one of these last week. \"Kay\" hides under a desk, weeping.Wait - what is everyone's problem? What about that pan-galactic missile shield thing?Kay talked you out of it? Kay wouldn't do that. He's the most distrustful person in the galaxy. He personally set up that system to defend our planet from the scum of the universe.Yeah, that's working out great. Look, I don't know what's frying everyone's brains, but I remember the missile shield --- Kay -- the real Kay -- loved that thing. He wouldn't shut up about it. I mean, that thing was all Kay.Where the hell did he.get an iPhone in 1969?You're definitely not Kay!Where you going in such a hurry, Obadiah? The past?I know you've been time-travelling.Yeah? What's this? Reveal the thing he just hit him with -- a ship's bell with S.S. TITANIC on it.What else you got here?Oh, yeah? Off a Dodo in a cage.Is that a dodo bird?I think he'd be happier free. Jay frees the bird -- it runs, squawking...Interesting. Jay picks up Spider-Man 8 off the blanket. Featuring chubby, bald 50-year-old Tobey Maguire.And this? Reveal a copy of the Declaration of Independence..Listen -- I'll look the other way if you tell me who's selling time travel these days. I just want your supplier.Don't worry, he won't have time.Those hit the sun in 8 minutes. You want to live out those minutes? Or you want me to take you out of your misery? Jay picks up an ancient weapon -- crossbow, blunderbuss -- off the blanket and puts it to the criminal's head.I just want a name.Yeah, well, the thing about tomorrow is, we'll all be busy being dead.Help me, or the world is gonna end.Right. Take a look at this. Jay directs Cera's sightline to the sky--That, is We're all dead in... SevenYou start sharing the illegal time travel tech you've been slinging.You only need seven minutes, get the cheap one. He grabs Trevor-Where is it??Yes, but we're running out of time--Oh, I see the problem. He CHUCKS THE PHONE across the store, where it SMASHES TO PIECES. She leaves in a huff.That's it? Jay does it.Okay, thanks.Don't worry, I'll fix it. You'll only be dead for a little while. Jay DISSOLVES INTO A TIME TRAVEL EFFECT... Cera is left alone. The missiles get EVER CLOSER... Trevor opens a \"Voice Recorder\" app:Yeah. Jay's moves to the elevator, waits for it. Pockets the profits of the racist misunderstandings. Elevator opens, the elevator operator opens the door -- Jay climbs in with a car full of older executives. Jay shakes his head, just taking this all in.Wow. 1969. You're all dead now. Just as the elevator's about to close, a leggy blonde tosses him a set of keys.Guess what? Black president! He laughs and drives off. Pulls up at...Yeah, thanks, listen--Nothing, officer. I'll be on my way.Thanks.Yeah, I'm the North American champion of kiss my ass. The cop loses his smile, turns to his partner:Kay? Kay, is that you? Oh, man it's good to see you, buddy! Jay hugs Kay -- who remains stony-faced. Jay gets a little choked up to see his friend alive -- Kay is a rock.Look at you, all... sort-of- young... Kay!Oh! You think -- aw,that's funny. No, it's not like that. You see, I'm your partner.There's a simple explanation for that.You see I'm your partner... (knows he's about to soundYeah, ok, I know it sounds a little-That's why I'm going to prove it to you... Because if I weren't from the future, would I know about -- your little top-secret headquarters right HERE?? He tries to force the door open. Nothing.I said -- HERE?Right. Not here yet. But it will be. Gonna need to get rid of the raccoons and bats and stuff, but... it'll be real nice. Game room over there for your pinball, you love your pinball. Lotta good times there -- I'm going for an extra ball, Jay! you'd say. And I'd be there. With you. Partners. Long stare from Kay.Is this your favorite place? Makes. sense. Zero human interaction. Kay ignores him.So how old are you?Really? Wow, you got some city miles on you. Jay laughs. Kay ignores him, stops in front of a machine offering \"SPECIALS\". Jay grabs a paper off a nearby table: We see headlines about Nixon, Vietnam, the Apollo Launch.The fourteenth. Then we have two days. Kay really takes his time, picking out the right sandwich.Hey, look, I know your lunch is important, but like I said, we only have two days here.No way, man. I am not letting you eat that. I didn't come all the way here to have you die before I can tell you-- Kay reaches for the button. Jay slaps his hand away. A BEAT of undignified hand-slap-fighting--No way, man. No way the world ends because you had to eat that thing-- Kay SUCCEEDS IN HITTING THE BUTTON andHey! [long alien name] and Bob! Don't worry, you guys get a big promotion in, like, 20 years. Kay takes Jay down an escalator. Quick atmospheric establishing shots of MiB '69: - A wall of Black and White TVs monitoring the aliens of the times: Castro... Yoko... Hendrix... - A cluster of agents use a joystick to manipulate a very high-tech camera. Reveal they're using it to watch a secretary's ass. She gets wise, turns -- they raise their martinis and she giggles at them: You're incorrigible! - Aliens work switchboards, work in the steno pool. - Someone barks at an alien to grab a couple Mooners and go clean something up. - An MiB barbershop quartet practices.What planet are they from?Finally.Oh, we're gonna do the forms now. Listen, Kay, I know you're gonna do what you're gonna do, but we're burning time here. When I got here, you had 48 hours. Now you've got 46.My name is Agent Jay, you gave it to me.To save the Earth. Kay looks at the form, there's a number of options to check: \"Create a new race... Steal Earth women... Offer life of eternal youth... vacation... Save the Earth.\" He checks the box.Fine, don't believe me. But just listen to what I have to say, because it's going to save your life and the life of everyone in this galaxy. It hangs in the air...There's a killer out there. Goes by \"Yaz.\" He's coming for you. You told me your one regret was not killing him when you had the chance.You will. Here's what to look for. Long hair, leather, looks kind of like a biker. You'll know him from the skull ring on his pinky. He's trying to blow up the Earth and you get in his way somehow so he kills you. This Friday. In Florida. So, if you want to live -- do not go to Florida.Man, you're as stubborn as you always were. I mean -- always will be. Look, It's not just about you. Because he kills you, you don't live long enough to build the defense shield. And without a defense shield, the Earth gets destroyed. You get it? He kills you, the Earth gets destroyed. I have to save you from him so we can save the planet. Kay stops writing.So what's code 43? They pass through a set of double doors. Tilt up to reveal:Whoa, whoa, what? You're gonna neuralize ME? You can't neuralize me. Haven't you been listening? Two ALIEN ORDERLIES grab Jay.You erase what's in here, you erase the whole world.I don't need to calm down.I AM a good agent! Kay takes a SWING at Jay -- Jay dodges it easily.That's right, you always lead with your left.I know you, Kay, I can prove it...You've got a scar on the back of your right hand! Jay grabs Kay's hand. They LOCK EYES for a moment. Kay lets Jay flip his hand over, big build-up, REVEALING... .no scar.Damn. You will! I swear! Kay signals -- the Neuralizer powers up. And Jay is on the conveyor belt into the machine. This is all about to be over. Jay thinks desperately for a way out, THEN-- Eureka!!Kay! KAY!!! What about your girl on Martha's Vineyard?You chose the job over her -- but you never stopped thinking about her. You can't forget her. Kay grabs him.You see, Kay? It's me-- But Kay grabs him and puts a gun on him--Yeah, okay, um -- according to the file, he should have entered Earth- space in the last couple days. Did you spot any unauthorized landings in the last 48 hours? Kay looks to a tech, who looks at a clipboard --Can I ask how you're planning on getting me out of here?How's it going, fellas? Look, I put on my pants. He feels one of the agent's faces. Kay leads him to the exit. He talks to Jay as if Jay is a dim 3rd-grader who speaks little English:Aww. Did I spoil the mood?Yeah, yeah. Window out of my head. But hey -- if I don't save you, I'm dead anyway. So do what you want to me -- just make sure you watch out for yourself. They pull up to...This doesn't look like a mob hit.Spores. Dematerializing corpses. And THAT. Jay points beyond the building... a SHEER DROP Which is the edge of a HUGE SMOKING CRATER -- And how did this crater get here?Aren't you gonna give me a.gun?You try not to get in MY way. Jay and Kay move towards the building... BAM! BAM! BAM!! Someone's firing at them -- they dive for cover. More GUNSHOTS -- Jay gives Kay THE SIGNAL, WE SAW IN THE CHINESE RESTAURANTStay behind me. You need to stay alive.Huh. So that's how you got the scar. Jay tosses his EMPTY GUN into the corner -- the guy under the desk fires FIVE TIMES - EMPTYING HIS GUN! Jay sprints at him, flips the table -- it's a terrified, quivering WISEGUY. Jay grabs him and DISARMS HIM. The guy is FREAKED OUT.What'd he look like?Pull it together! Jay SLAPS THE GUY.The guy who did this --- what'd he look like?That's him.What about the witness? We don't have time to take him back to HQ toYeah.Aw, this means you like me, doesn't it?In two days he's gonna kill you in Florida.Sorry, I was distracted by the Earth blowing up.Alien Town? They drive under a sign indicating: EAST VILLAGEThere's gotta be something that connects you to Yaz. What cases are you working on?Dry ice? What's that? Someone get killed over some dry ice? Smuggling something in some dry ice?Wow, you're pretty low on the totem pole, aren't you? The great Kay, looking for dry ice.What - me?[Grumbles about what he has to do for his partner]. We need to talk. Please. Warhol and his Stars ooh and ahh over Jay. Someone snaps a picture.Actually, I'm his old partner. I came from the future to warn himWe're looking for a recent arrival. Long hair, wears a lot of leather... Warhol indicates the party below -- half the guests match that description.Hold up -- the guy we're looking for -- he's out to destroy the world.I thought you made that up.33 hours.Just wondering where you got that.Really. So my mother gave you a technology that hasn't beenNow how about you tell me where you really got it? The skanky guy knows he's in trouble.Alright, one more time. Where'd you get this?Bullshit. Kay puts a gun on him.Oh, hey. This is my partner. He's about to get fired for excessive violence and he doesn't have much left to lose.That's what I like. A nice, honest thief. Stole it from who?Who?Archanans? They're pretty far out of their neighborhood. I didn't think we'd ever had one on Earth before.I'll do a lot worse. Get the hell out of here. The guy runs off.You were wearing one just like it when you died. Come on.So you come here tomorrow, get tangled up with these Archanans... And...Something like that. So do me and the people of Earth a favor and be careful.Hey, I've always got my big girl panties on. Huh. That didn't sound right.Not just any game, PONG. Game of kings. But it wasn't invented until 1974.Because I was the only kid on my block who didn't have one.Didn't have a daddy to not buy me toys. Here's the only thing I ever got from him-- He holds up his key chain.It gets worse. You're the closest thing I have to a dad.That's from Yaz's ring. He was here. Or is here. Jay SIGNALS KAYSo Yaz was never after you... he was after the Archanans. You just got in the way.'No sign of struggle. They must've cleared out before he got here. Like they knew he was coming.Think this might tell us something? On the $100 bill: A strange series of words and numbers: 3 2... 5 1... 7 5..How about bible verses? Coordinates? Airplane flights? Shoe sizes?Slow down -- who's after you?Get in.So where can we take you?Are you sure? Seems dangerous.What the hell was that?Say that again!No, the whole thing!I know where they are!How are we going to find them? Any idea what an Archanan looks like? And then -- they see --You're in danger--Very cute, but--Huh?Thanks.Take the bridge... They take the bridge, which gives them an advantage on Yaz. At one point, Jay corners Yaz -- Yaz BLASTS HIM -- Jay is knocked down. Looks DEAD! But he shakes it off reveal the PONG medallion blocked the shot. Culminating at a toxic waste dump in Staten Island, with Yaz compressed into .a six inch cube - hauled away in the back of a garbage truck. The guys give chase -- they want him captured, but no luck. The truck drives off...Only a matter of time before he comes back. And this time he might be really mad.Damn, we lost them. They come all the way across the universe and just when we're about to figure out what all of this is about-- Then, faintly... a CHEEREverybody OK?Yeah... guess I can't argue with that. So listen up -- Yaz is down but he won't be for long, so we need to start coming up with some answers. First of all-- The Archanans CHEER. Jay shakes it off.What are you cheering about?!What races? Jay and Kay cross the threshold into their aura... and now-- The empty stands are FILLED WITH CHEERING SPECTATORS WATCHINGWhere are we?You... can see the future.Revenge?, For what?Okay, someday you're gonna explain that to me, but right now you need to stop the riddles because there's about two minutes until Yaz crawls out of his hole and gets back to trying to kill you. So help me out. I need to know IN ENGLISH why Yaz is trying to kill you and what that has to do with saving the Earth.You know what... he will know... You know his plans.Okay, which future is the one where you live and the Earth doesn't blow up?No! We need to get them home! But it's all drowned out in the wind and dust... MiB \"squad cars\" -- pull up and surround them. Jay and Kay look for an escape route -- but MiB cars and trucks seem to be pouring in from everywhere. MiB agents descend on ropes, round up the Archanans--I knew Agent Kay wasn't just gonna lie down. So what's the plan?Over there, Kay! As they run off --I know you're a little freaked out and you want to call for backup, but listen: When you've done this job for a while, you realize there's one rule -- things aren't what they seem. These are innocent beings that need our protection. Are you gonna do the right thing or are you gonna be a company man and send them off to die in Toronto? The young agent thinks -- puts down the radio.Good, good. What's your name?He's gonna be better than OK. I'm not gonna give you so much shit anymore. The radio CRACKLES --Be nice to him. Trust me. Jay, Kay and the Archanans regroup.Okay, you all wanted to go home. Well here we are. So how do you want to get off this rock? You guys have the spaceport on Long Island yet? Kay just looks at him.That place is a dump anyway. Best Margaritas in the Universe, my ass. What about the one in Ohio? The Archanans smile.Here, huh? You're sure?I'll take that as a strong \"yes.\" Okay, then. Follow me. Jay pockets the card and starts herding them across the terminal. Kay catches up --Omaha. And I'm gonna buy you the biggest T-bone you ever saw when we get there. So -- you head over to the Omaha tube and I'm gonna help these guys over here for a second. But I'll meet you in a minute. By the Omaha tube. They stare at each other --No, no, no. No way. Florida, Kay.Don't you get it?This is why you were there. In Florida. Because of them. You were helping them and that's why... that's why you get killed. Today, July 16. I saw the report myself. Agent Kay, dead at the scene. Killed by Yaz.I just want you to know, I'm doing this out of love, man.You stay home and stay alive. But Kay isn't down.Damn, you used to have some abs. They continue to pound each other. As they trade punches:I can't let you go to Florida.Bet you're sorry you taught me that. The fight continues... They're wearing down, circling each other... And then Kay fakes a left ---You always lead with your-- But this time Kay connects with his right, knocking Jay down hard.I can't let you go -- I love you! Jay KICKS KAY SAVAGELY IN THE GROIN. Kay LUNGES AT JAY. They CLINCH... it's a stalemate...I'm not falling for that.(yelling over the windOh. Okay, then. Thanks, good to hear.What does that mean? The Lama smiles and zips ahead through the current. Jay gets CLOBBERED by a bend in the tube.De-tube?Helmet? No one said anything aboutThanks. Surrounded by thick brush, trees. Jay staggers out of the water, looking beat to hell.Kay? Archanans? Everyone OK?Listen, your, uh... Arachaness...ness? I don't think this here is the way back to your planet. The Archanans smile and WALK OFF... Jay and Kay follow --Hey wait -- we can't help you get home, if you don't tell us how... He trails off as they EMERGE FROM THE BRUSH And stop dead...Whoa. So that's how you're getting home. Reveal -- A GLORIOUS SHOT OF THE APOLLO ROCKET And they head towards destiny...Okay. So we've got... 30 minutes to get past security. Get into Mission Control. Reprogram the flight path, pull the Astronauts off the launch and get them in that rocket.Weird. I feel like I've been here.'Scuse me... I need to get inside... I've got the big man's Cadillac... all washed and ready to- Before the words are out of Jay's mouth, he's down on the ground with a submachine gun stuck in his neck.You've got it wrong, let me explain-Finally, someone I can talk to-- But the Colonel is on him before you can blink, an equal- opportunity hardass to the extreme:Sir, before you do that --- my name is Agent Jay. I appreciate your position, but I'm from a top-secret government agency in charge of protecting the world from the scum of the universe and right now, on behalf of the people of Earth, I.: need to commandeer your rocket soWould it help if I told you I'm from the future?Things change when you can see the future, right?Attention, everyone! We've got a change in plans! Everyone's consumed with the launch and wearing headsets -- they ignore him -- he keeps trying --Hey! Attention over here! I need to talk to the man who can re- program this rocket! Still nothing --Can anyone hear me? Hey! You in the glasses!Slow down there! Everyone be cool!No! Stop! Do not abort!What's that? You been holding out on me?Ha ha, just like old times...Get under a--?What the hell was that??Catchy. The Archanans deftly step out of the way -- or the pellets swerve around them. EX RUNS IN, flanked by security and/or MiB agents.Five minutes to get to the rocket. And keep your eyes open for Yaz. They head out.But we've got some bigger fish to fry. Hand over the flight suits. They start pulling the astronauts off the truck. The astronauts protest.Let's go, people. Why don't you take one giant leap out of there.We good yet, Kay? I don't like being out here in the open -- too many ways for Yaz to get to you...Oh, come on -- what's going on?Oh, for...Lift it. You have to lift it.No, if I hold the lever, the rubber thingie won't... go in the thing where the thingie goes... Kay notices something in the reflection of the hatch glass.Because it's about to go down. They turn around, draw weapons on the tech -- it's YAZ!Nothing now. Yaz raises an eyebrow...Little something I brought with me. Jay points the gun at Yaz -- but Yaz just LAUGHS -- As the clock ticks down to T-minus 5... 4...That's a chance I'll have to take. Jay BLASTS YAZ Yaz stumbles BACK INTO THE CAPSULE... The hatch SLAMS him in! Just as the ROCKET BEGINS LIFTOFF--We did it, partner. I hope you remember this when you recruit me -- you won't give me such a hard time.Yeah.Do a better job this time, OK? That needs to be one hell of a prison. You don't want that guy coming back, or I'm coming back. Look, once was enough, OK? Jay turns to The Colonel --Thank you for your help, sir. Hope we don't get you fired.Can I ask you -- what did the Lama show you in there that made you help us? Was it the Earth being destroyed?Oh. Thanks. He's a lucky kid.Okay... The Colonel leaves. Jay and Kay congratulate each other, smile over a job well done... But then they see the Archanans... And realize...But we'll make sure you're safe here. And the next rocket out...No we didn't. You wanted to go home...Gift? But we didn't get you home.So then what's the gift?This? Pong?To make the missile defense system. You use this to save the world.Hey. My watch stopped. We see -- a minute to go. Jay looks at the watch. Something about it bothers him...Yeah, I'll catch up with you in a second.So you guys understand all this time stuff, right? So is everything going to be okay now? I mean, if I saved everything, and Yaz is really gone, why am I even here? Shouldn't I not have come in the first place? And why do I still have time left on my watch?3:59. But Kay didn't get killed until... And then the AWFUL REALIZATION --He didn't come yet! Kay, he didn't come yet!!! Jay races to find Kay.Kay! And then Jay sees -- Yazl Already there! Jay goes for his weapon, but he doesn't have the shot! Yaz pulls his guns...Where there is death, there will always be death. He saved your life. He swapped his for yours. He saved the world. Kay puts a firm hand on Jay --Leave me some memories this time,Yes you will. Kay turns back to the boy, takes his hand. Jay watches them from a distance: Kay takes something off the ground where The Colonel's body was -- hands it to the son.Noo!!!! And then...

Best noodles in town. And we are inGood evening, Mr. Wu.Not so fast, Wu. We'd like to take a look in the tanks.Jay, take a look at this. Wu protests, Jay blows by him.So this is what you're passing off as tuna? Reveal a giant tank holding a HUGE ALIEN FISH.Ugly AND a clear violation of Health ordinance 32, sellingI guess it would be. If you were Chinese! Reveal -- from the waist down, Wu has the BODY OF A SLUG.Aren't you forgetting something?Yeah, look -- clean fork.Come to think of it... Why is Wu getting our noodles... outside?Then come get it, you worthlessOh, I know what happens next.I've been waiting forty years for another shot at you, scum. Kay takes aim and... CLICK! Empty.Damn!They deserved what they got.Will you settle for a drink?Yaz. Put him away a long time ago. Biggest mistake I ever made.No. Should've killed him.That was too easy.You don't get it, hoss. This guy is different. Worse than anyone. He tried to blow up the Earth but I stopped him. He developed a dislike for me and for certain behaviors of mine, such as being alive.Maybe. (calling off to cleanupI know you do. Stares at his noodles a while, like there's answers in there:I used to play a game with my daddy. What would you want for your last meal. Could do worse than this.Do me a favor, don't badmouth your old man.I'm tired.Petrified. See you later. Kay takes a few tired steps and turns back --And slick? Watch yourself. A guy like Yaz can come after you when you least expect it. Anywhere, anytime. Jay watches Kay walk away. Looks like he's carrying a heavy load. Turns his attention to the clean up crew:What part of clean up everything don't you understand? There's a spleen on that car!Yeah?I'll take it from here.Agent Kay, Division 2, special... .black ops. Thank you for your cooperation, if I could ask you to look here for a moment -- Kay pulls out what looks like a NEURALIZER -- and swiftly beats each one over the head -- it's just a BLACKJACK -- they crumple.That's got to be the first time an unregistered alien caught sneaking onto Earth was happy to see me. Jay pulls away, realizing--If I had a partner I'd know it.I'm all ears.Well, thank you very much.Yeah, thought I'd heard them all. Usually, they offer a great gift to the people of Earth in exchange for refuge. Time-travelling partner from the future -- that's some extra-credit right there, and I do appreciate you bringing some much- needed variety to what can be a very dull job. But I'm still gonna have to bring you in.It sounds a LOT--Let's go. And word of advice -= I don't know what it's like on your planet, but around here, a guy with your... complexion in a car like that is gonna get some attention he doesn't want.Twenty-six.Here we go... Kay puts some money in the machine -- is about to make his selection. Jay reacts to it -- GROSS! We see -- the most unappealing ham sandwich ever. The meat is tinged with green and beginning to get a little fuzzy. No one in their right mind would buy this sandwich.The Hamptons. Let's go somewhere we can talk.Name, planet of origin and GalacticSave the Earth... Congratulations, you're the third one today... Maybe you'll get a balloon.Are you currently pregnant or preparing to spawn?Never heard of any Yaz.Florida? I hate Florida. I hate everything South of Virginia. If that's what you came to tell me, you're wasting your time.Huh. Well. This is finally starting to make sense. Jay looks hopeful.Because you're crazy. Paranoia. Delusions of self-importance--Hey, chief.Actually, still trying to sort it out. He says he's human.Got it, chief.This little baby here is called a Neuralizer. REVEAL -- The 1969 Neuralizer fills an entire room. And weHave a lay down, stretch. The orderlies force Jay on a sort of gurney -- in the '69 Neuralizer, the \"patient\" is fed through the machine, like for an MRI.Don't worry. When it's over, you'll forget all about this Yaz and Florida and the end of the world. I think it'll be good for you. Calm you down.Don't worry, it's safe. We even tested it on one of our own men. Kay indicates Q, who wanders around like he's been lobotomized.Hey, Agent Q! Q waves back:No, YOU'RE -- forget it. We're still.., fine-tuning it. okay, strap him down. TWO BIG-ASS ALIEN ORDERLIES force Jay down. A TECH flips the machine ON -- TUBES POWER UP WITH HUGE NOISENice moves. You'd make a good agent.You're just making it worse for yourself. The following plays over a game of CAT AND MOUSE around the giant structure of the Neuralizer -- like through the stacks in a library.There's nowhere to run, slim. It's just if we're gonna do it easy or do it hard. Jay runs into a dead end. Kay and the orderlies are on him. The pissed-off orderlies grab him roughly, force him onto the gurney. Jay keeps flailing.Bowling is enjoyed by more than 95 million people in more than 90 countries. You gotta do better than that.How the hell do you know that? I've never told anyone that. A long look at this guy, who somehow knows things he shouldn't. And he hits the POWER OFF BUTTON... But this being TUBE TECHNOLOGY -- we stay with JAY'S TERRIFYING POV -- as he slides through the claustrophobic Neuralizer chamber -- the tubes powering down just in time, inches away from him. Jay crawls out of the Neuralizer, shaken.If you're gonna drag her into this, you'd better be able to back up your story. Because if you're jerking me around, I'll make a window out of your head.'Scuse me, boys. Just did a code 43 on this one.You are a tourist from Kansas. A city slicker took your wallet at the bus station... Kay leads Jay to a SET OF DOORS MARKED \"EXIT to STREET\" --Two out. The agents nod to Kay and WAVE HIM THROUGH-THE EXIT... Which deposits them in...You'd better not be wasting my time-That's a hell of an observation. What gave it away?We're going in. Kay draws his weapon.Right. He pulls out a Smith and Wesson, dumps the bullets, and hands it over.Try not to get in my way.What the hell is that?The hell I will. Jay tries to go in -- Kay pushes him out of the way and goes in first.We've got something new. Portable Neuralizer. With a rumbling and BLASTS OF AIRHORNS, 18-wheelers drive up, housing the \"portable\" Neuralizer.Can you believe how small these things are getting?Okay, slick. I'm making a decision to believe you. Not because I do, but because I have to, you get me? He walks to the trunk, pops it open. He flips a switch, revealing a HIDDEN ARSENAL. He grabs a COOL GUN and gives it to Jay. Jay admires theLet's go get this sunovabitch. They climb in but -- SCREECH!!! A Crown Vic swerves to a stop in front of them. Out pops anMake it thirteen. He GUNS IT -- THEY TEAR OFF...Now tell me everything you know about this Yaz scumbag.Two days. Doesn't give me a lot of time. You couldn't have come back a week ago?So we have two days to kill him before he kills me. Alright, there's one cesspool everyone washes up in sooner or later. Someone'll know something there. Come on. Let's take a drive to Alien Town.Well, I'got this whole dry ice thing.No. We just can't figure out what it is.Don't push your luck. The doors open, and we're in...We need to talk. Reveal ANDY WARHOL -- and this is the Factory, and this is one of Warhols' famous parties. Draped on Warhol -- a bunch of strange hangers-on, his \"stars.\"Take it easy agent W, your cover is perfectly safe.Cool your jets--Yeah, I know they are, buddy. But you're doing good work here. We need you. A knock at the door -- Warhol gets back into character --Maybe you know someone who's seen something.C'mon, W, I got a feeling on this one. Like we should take it serious. And we don't have much time. Jay checks his watch.Start talking, you two, before you end up on a barber's floor.Yeah? Kay reaches into a passing woman's purse, pulls out HAIRSPRAY. Grab some of Prell and holds up the spray.You wanna play tough? How about we take a ride to the barber college, see how tough you are? Kay keeps shaking them down, but Jay is distracted... On Jay... something is making him think... A sound... it. grows louder... we start to be able to make out the distinct bip... bip... bip... of PONG Jay FOLLOWS THE SOUND... To a group of people -- that incredible Factory mix from slumming socialites to Black Panthers to the freakiest freaks... They surround a SKANKY GUY -- and whatever they're watching on TV is so mesmerizing it's like they're seeing the face of God...Then you're not worth much to us, are you? The gun comes back out.What's the deal with the necklace?That address. It's familiar. He pulls out a notebook.I was going to come by here tomorrow to check out a lead on the dry ice case.And Yaz kills me?Aw, put on your big girl panties and let's go.That thing back at the party, what was it? Some kind of game?How do you know that?Aw, what's the matter? Daddy didn't buy you the toy you wanted?That's rough.Why do you keep doing that?Which must make them damn important. But what does he want with them?And he's probably on their trail now. But where the hell did they go? They look around, puzzling over this place. Jay picks up a $100 bill off a table made out of stacks of money.Looks like some kind of code. We'll take it to HQ, run it through the computer. Figure out where they went.So this is how you do it in the future, huh? You just keep guessing until you figure it out?I don't know, but I'd bet you two to one Yaz sent her. Beat. Light bulb moment for Jay --I think Yaz sent her.I'd bet you two to one Yaz sent her. On Jay, realizing-- He grabs the $100 bill --I think I found them. They step intoYaz! They turn to see YAZ -- he levels a WEAPON AT THEM -- FIRES! Jay and Kay DUCK -- the weapon just misses.Let's get into trouble. Jay and Kay engage him -- As they run off, the Lama calls --He's gone.Hold that thought. They follow it out toDon't you know if he's going to?Alright, let's get these freaks home, and pronto.That was someone else. All these mooners look alike, right? A beat -- and Ex buys it completely.But they're in danger. One of the most dangerous beings in the universe is out to kill them-- And if that happens, we're all going with them, because they're our only hope of survival.It sounds like you need to cut some eyeholes in your stomach, because your head is so far up your ass, that's the only way you could possibly see.Don't worry, we'll--What?You heard the man. We've got dry ice to investigate.Just a few more questions about dry ice and I'll be out of your hair... A BIRD CALL makes Kay turn --.he sees Jay waving him over, pointing at something -- The MiB agents lead the Archanans into the Station!. Thanks, you've been very helpful. Jay and Kay peel off, follow the MiB agents, leaving the Vendor scratching his head. He turns back to the kids. Jay and Kay follow the MiBers and Archanans inside...Damn. Wrong freaks. But Jay spots the Archanans...On your 2 o'clock. They spot the MiBers and the Archanans next to the TUBE TOHold up.Change in plans.Yeah, Ex just gave us the new orders -- check this out -- Kay gestures them closer -- he reaches for something in his jacket pocket... The MiBers lean in... And Kay GRABS THEM AND SHOVES THEM BACKWARDS TOWARDS THEYou're gonna be okay, kid. Jay can't help laughing --Where are we going? Jay looks at him a beat.Sounds good. See you there. Kay turns to head off -- then, lightening fast, spins and reaches into Jay's pocket, snatches out the card --Omaha, my ass. Kay looks at the card: GREETINGS FROM SUNNY FLORIDA -- a tourist post card with palm trees, oranges and beaches.Let's go.That's what it says.Yeah, it's hot and muggy. The old people drive slow.We'll stay somewhere air- conditioned and only drive after three when they're at dinner.You know what an MiB agent calls it when he faces death? Besides I got you to watch my back, right? They walk to the FLORIDA TUBEDoing what? He gets his answer -- Jay DECKS HIM.I told them I'd help them -- I'm honor-bound to do it. Kay throws a DIRTY SUCKER-PUNCH to Jay's kidney. Jay recovers and throws an UPPERCUT to Kay's solar plexus. Jay winces -- like he just hit something hard.I make my own future! Besides -- I'm younger and stronger than you!Had enough yet? On Jay -- gasping, spent -- using every last reserve of strength to lift himself off that floor.Aw, hell, look at that-- behind you-I'm not kidding -- Kay rotates their clinch towards the tube so Jay can see... The ARCHANANS -- very cheerfully, benignly hopping into theWell, then. Better get started.Good work. It's like we're not even here.Little something I've been working on. Glasses if you've got 'em. Jay and Kay put on their glasses...Oh, and you might want to get under a desk.It's a high-velocity non-lethal pellet-gun. The boys in the lab call it the \"hiv-nol-pog.\"What a waste.No disrespect meant, [major]. I'm a big fan.I'm almost there. Kay's got them inside, but having problems with the hatch.Hey, tech guys -- get back here and help me with the door.Whatever, just get over here.This door is complicated.What? It's an Apollo rocket, not a Plymouth Valiant, OK? It's complicated. Jay goes over to help Kay with the door. They both fuss and fight over the door.No, I am lifting it. You have to hold the lever.Jay... Why do you think a highly trained NASA technician would leave the back of his suit unzipped? They exchange a look that parallels the opening scene in the Chinese restaurant...What's that?Uh oh -- But the Archanans surround them with their aura -- where the flames and smoke flow harmlessly around them... And then it's over...You know I will.I guess we'll have to build a prison on the moon or something. Jay realizes -- grabs Kay --We're sorry we didn't get you home, guys. It was the only way to get rid of Yaz.C'mon. Let's go watch that bastard leave the atmosphere.See? I knew you had my back. Jay hears footsteps. Looks up and sees the SHADOW OF A TALLI'll take it from here. Kay steps away... but turns back. In a replay of the moment from the first movie, Jay tosses Kay a modern Neuralizer.Sure, partner. I'll see you around.Hey, look -- your Dad wanted you to have this. Kay gives the kid a shiny new commemorative Apollo key chain. Jay looks in his pocket -- the same key chain, scratched and worn.Your daddy had to go -- he's part of the space program, now. He's okay, he just had to take a trip up to the stars, but you'll be just fine. I'll keep an eye on you... They are silhouetted by the bright light of the Apollo launch... Jay takes out his iPhone and ALL GOES WHITE...Alright, everyone, give me and my partner here a minute. They leave the guys alone. A beat -- and Jay just wraps him in THE BIGGEST HUG EVER.You mean, do I remember that you travelled back in time to save my life and the world? Not bad, slick. Not bad.Well, I don't know exactly. Because I was dead. But in a quantum reality, objects can exist in contradictory states... So multiple timelines with varying probabilities can exist, and the one you're closest toYes he was.So you travelled back in time, huh?Wow. And you didn't change anything?You're sure?
