DOCK - ISLAND - DAYLook, Skip, it wasn't your fault. It was an accident. You didn't know.Muffy!I don't want to hear about this.He wasn't married?My goodness, daddy, what big ...what big... teeth you have.How friendly will we feel once we've finished with those beans?So it's going to be one of those dinners, huh?I think we should change the subject.Rob knows. He's going to medical school.Why? You had your meeting with your counselor, didn't you?Why not? We're all friends.Muffy, anything you want to add to that?G'night.Rob?You still angry with me? About dinner?Good morning!Rob? What's wrong?Are you giving up?I don't know. I'm scared. I don't know if I want what Mom and everybody else expects of me. I don't want to go to law school....only it's not made up.It's made up about one thing though.We saw him... on a boat... drifting by the pier. He wasn't movinq. He looked dead... unless he was joking...!I saw his face!No Skip?I think it's about time we called the police.I don't think we should wait any longer...Let me help.Rob? No, we haven 't been able to get through to the mainland yet.No water?No water.You don't want to know.It's okay, Nikki. With the others... they were outdoors. But we're inside now, and we're safe.I don't understand.I just came in to make sure everything was secure to lock the windows.It could be the tides.Rob's checking the back of the house.What do you mean?Stop it! Just stop it all of you! What is wrong with us? Nhat happened to all our talk about friendship, and undying loyalty? Do you know what we're saying? That we're actually sitting here discussing the possibility that Muffy, a generous friend, has invited us all here to --Why?No one's been up here in years.Can you see him?Or... he's chosen not to use it.What?So that's why you let her go upstairs?What did he mean by that?But that's ridiculous...Rob, wait a minute. What's that?She's been up here.Rob?Rob? . . .Rob??...Nikki?Chaz?... Nikki?...Rob!!!Rob, what about Muffy?She's my friend!Muffy! Muffy!!This way!Maybe he went on to the house.Rob!Miss .St. John?

The doors. They've been closed.What's that?Rob...Muffy's clothes...Rob!Oh, god... oh no!......the picture of the girls in the study... the letter... what the Constable was trying to tell you... It's not Muffy it's her twin sister, Buffy! She has a twin sister! Rob's eyes have a glazed look. They are fixed somewhere else.Rob, don't you see? Rob?Rob!Rob?No...Rob!!!Buffy?... please, we didn't mean any harm... we're leaving... we just want to go home... please... please...No... Oh, God...What.... ?Oh, fuck you!! Fuck you, you guys!!What's this all about? And don't anyone say \"April Fool's\" or I'll smack them in the teeth.He's your brother?!Which means, I guess, that you're no constable either.I don't care what Columbia says about you.Is this the road to med school?If that's what you want.I don't know. Too much champagne?Well, I hate to say it -- I still ought to kill you -- but thanks. See you back there.Well, I kinda like the idea -- and I don't have work to get back to.Just because you've decided to get serious about your life, doesn't mean the rest of us can't have our funSo how many does that make us?Cal, we want to get back to the island.I know.What's going on?What?...Oh, no... what about Rob?

No kidding'?Oh, c'mon.I don't like this... I definitely don't think I like this...What's happening.What!Jesus. I'll go. Just point me in the right direction.Is that it?You mean, back home on the farm?Why?Draw me some water.What happened?Harve.You didn't.I'm a big girl now. I think I can handle a few spiders and FROGS ---In the well ! Oh, God, the well!We have to leave, all of us, we have to get away.It's all because of what happened on the ferry, isn't it?She's been acting less than normal anyway.You mean all day and you haven't noticed?...and those nurse's shoes.The clodhoppers she's been wearing today... crepe soles...I found somethin\"g in my room, too...only I don't think it was intended for me .What I'd like to know is, how did Muffy find out about these things and why -- ?She's got a point. We're starting to get on each other's nerves.You coming?What do you mean, Nikki, come on? Don't give me any of this Nikki, come on.Look, stay if you like. Lock your door. Dig a trench. Hang out. But once I leave this place, I'm never coming back.Yeah, that's been real effective...Then I'll swim all the way back to the mainland... I can be strong if I have to. INT.

I'm tired of having one fling after another. I don't want any more of that. I want a boyfriend. Chaz? Will you be my boyfriend?When anything g.oes, everything goes.Go back and give her a taste of her own medicine, that's what we should do.She sure wouldn't be expecting it...!Buck, got any spare professional tricks you could throw our way!Muffy, hi! Surprise!No, no, nothing's wrong. Chaz and I just figured there was nothing we had to get back to that couldn't wait and you could probably use a hand with the clean-up. It's our way of saying thank you.Putting the boat up in the old boathouse. He'll be up in a minute.I wonder what's keeping Chaz? He should have been up here by now.Still... I'm beginning to not like this.The boat? Oh, Cal gave us one.No, really. I don't want to go alone. I'm still scared from last night. Please come with me.No, that's okay. I'll be fine.Shit.Fuck!Fuck!!
