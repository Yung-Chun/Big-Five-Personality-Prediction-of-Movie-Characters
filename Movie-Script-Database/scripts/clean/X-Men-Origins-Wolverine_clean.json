{"X-Men-Origins-Wolverine": {"KAYLA": {"raw_line": "It's okay... shh... it's okay. Logan pants, chest heaving, eyes wild, gripping the tattered sheets in his fists. Kayla holds him tight until his bone claws retract. KAYLA I'm right here with you. Okay? I'm right here with you. Kayla, a full-blooded Innu, wears her long black hair pulled back in a ponytail. She's been sleeping in one of Logan's flannel shirts. KAYLA The war dreams or the one where you're a kid? Logan takes a deep breath, finally calming down. He relaxes into Kayla's arms.It's nothing. Just a scratch. She kisses him. KAYLA We need new sheets again, baby.Nice. Logan, caught with a snowball in his hand, looks sheepish.Stryker? Colonel Stryker? The one you told me about? What did he want?And?So why can't they get someone else? Logan thinks about it for a moment. When he speaks there is a degree of self-loathing in his tone.Hey. You're not a freak.You're not a freak. You've got a gift.The kids made cornhusk dolls today in Arts and Crafts. She reaches for her bag and pulls out a little doll. KAYLA I made one for you. Kayla hands him the doll and he examines it by firelight. Given the limitations of the art form, it's a skillful representation of Logan, unique hairstyle and all.You're Elvis with claws. The moon, swollen and red-hued, rises above the dark hills, framed in the cabin's window. I coNTTNTTRn 1You know why the moon's so lonely? Logan shakes his head. Kayla lies back, resting her head on Logan's leg as he plays with her hair. KAYLA She used to have a lover. Kuekuatsheu. They lived in the Spirit World and every night they'd wander the skies together. But one of the other spirits was jealous. Trickster wanted the Moon for himself. So he told Kuekuatsheu the Moon asked for flowers. He told him to come to our world and pick her some wild roses.Yeah, well, you do some stupid things when you're in love. Kuekuatsheu didn't know that once you leave the Spirit World, you can never go back. Now he's trapped here. Every night the Moon searches for him and every night he sees her in the sky and howls her name... but he can never touch her again. For a moment they're both quiet, contemplating the sad myth.Kuekuatsheu. The Wolverine.Be careful. Logan bends forward to kiss her on the lips. He turns and walks towards a crew of LUMBERJACKS circled around a SUPERVISOR with a clipboard. Logan turns when he hears a honk. Kayla leans out the window. KAYLA I love you, by the way. Logan notices that dozens of lumberjacks are watching this scene. He clears his throat.Please? I'm already late.Thanks, fellas.Lolly Lolly Lolly get your adverbs here, Lolly Lolly Lolly got some adverbs here, Come on down to Lolly's get the adverbs here... Rounding a corner on the narrow access road, Kayla nearly collides with a man in a long black coat. She slams on the brakes and the truck shudders to a halt. The man's back is turned to the truck, his head bowed. His hair hangs below his shoulders, clotted with dirt, as if he's been sleeping in the woods for weeks. Kayla leans out of the open truck window. Before she can speak, the man in the long black coat turns. It's not just his size that frightens us, though the man is massive. It's not just the four-inch-long black talons curling from his fingertips, or the gleaming fangs he licks as he smiles at her. What terrifies us most are his eyes. They are a shark's eyes, black and loveless and utterly inhuman. f CONTTNT1FD'Hey, you've reached Kayla and Logan. We're not home right now so please leave a message after the beep and we'll get back to you as soon as we can. Bye! Beep. Logan replaces the receiver in its cradle and' lies back, alone in the world.I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. An aluminum baseball bat whirs through the air, smashing the back of Logan's head. Logan falls to the floor, unconscious. Victor Creed stands above him, staring at the flattened barrel of the baseball bat. f nNTTNITFT)1You know who I am.They gave me a syringe full of hydrochlorothiazide.Reduces the heartbeat to almost zero. Breathing virtually stops. Makes you flatline for six minutes. Kayla hops down from the truck. She holds out the IV bag to Victor, who casually pierces it with his claw. KAYLA I'd been drawing my own blood every night for the past week. I had four liters ready that morning. Kayla smears. her own blood on her body and empties the rest of the bag on the pavement. She lies down in the puddle in a fetal position, her breathing already beginning to slow.Shot my Daddy when I was eighteen. Big mistake. Should have shot him when I was seventeen.Maybe he had a heart attack after I shot him. Sat there and watched him bleed. After what that man did to me, I wish he died slower. Logan stares at her for a long time. KAYLA That sweet little girl you lived with in the cabin? That was all make-believe.I'm a good actress.My Daddy found out when I was twelve. Said a freak like me deserved whatever I got.Spent so much time getting you to love me, by the time the Colonel showed up I couldn't get you to leave me. (r0N'rTN1 F.n 1My mother told me that story. She takes a deep breath and turns to go. KAYLA It doesn't matter. You won't remember any of this.What?You don't know where I come from. You don't know what it was like.I didn't have a choice.I'm sorry. t C()NTTNTTPTI'You're going to let Victor kill that woman. Stryker and Collins ignore her. KAYLA When you got me out of prison, you told me we were going to help people. Stryker continues to sign papers, never looking up.From the mutants? The phone rings. Stryker answers it.Is he clean yet? Cornelius and the assistant face front again..He was good to me. Cornelius, fiddling with the amperage dial, curls his lips in a sardonic smile.You should turn it off now. Cornelius turns and stares at her.You two have always hated each other. You should fight. The assistant blinks and begins to scowl, turning toward Cornelius just in time to get punched in the mouth. The two men brawl on the floor with the lack of skill you'd expect from two scientists.Hey. Wake up. Logan opens his eyes. He is clearly disoriented, as if waking from a long coma. He stares up at Kayla. KAYLA Are you okay? Logan stares at her, groggy and confused. KAYLA Do you understand what I'm saying?Please...Please... Creed's killing your friend.Please! We shouldn't be fighting each other. Stryker's using us.What's he gonna do with us when the other mutants are dead? Put us in a zoo? Creed hesitates, considering the logic of her words. A fanged smile splits his face.Get out of here. Hines doesn't have to be told twice. She flees. Creed sees his plaything running out the door. He snarls in frustration.We're here as guests of Colonel Stryker. The sentries' hostility shifts into apologetic obeisance.You boys are no longer needed here. Go back to barracks.Logan! Kayla runs down one of the steel staircases that clings to the cavern wall like fire escapes. KAYLA If we get closer to Stryker, I can work my magic. Logan stares at Stryker, his true enemy, the.man who destroyed his life. Ten thousand clones. encircle Stryker, who stands on the raised podium in the cavern's center.What are you doing?One of them could have survived. Logan glances at her. KAYLA The clones. They've got your healing factor. Logan looks back at the devastation.There's something I want you to know. He looks at her.

Kayla runs her fingers through his thick hair, kissing his forehead. He sees that she has a small cut on her forearm. He takes her arm and looks at the wound.How'd you find me?Agriculture? You working with farmers? Agent Zero grins. There is nothing pleasant about his grin,.Still shooting first, asking questions later? In one blindingly fast motion, Agent Zero pulls a customized automatic from his shoulder holster, fires, and reholsters.That was a buck twenty-five, asshole. Stryker holds up both hands, one palm to Logan, one to Zero.You're taking it.Not interested.Already got a job.Eighteen five.Yeah, I am. It's good work. And I haven't killed anybody in three years.Right about now I am. Agent Zero grins, enjoying the game. Stryker, seeing that this is going badly, tries to break the tension.Forget it. Logan walks around to the front of the cabin. Stryker and Agent Zero follow. Logan's battered old pickup truck is parked beside the newcomers' Lincoln.I can take care of myself.I'm Canadian. He hits the gas, forcing Stryker to jump back lest the tires run over his foot. Stryker and Agent Zero watch him go.Hey, fellas. The boys and girls look up and see Logan sitting on a second- floor window ledge. He has already formed six perfect snowballs, with which he proceeds to pelt the fourth graders. The kids run, screaming and laughing, nearly colliding with Kayla, who rounds the corner and stares up at Logan.They started it.Stryker came by the house today.Wants me back.Told him no.I'm the best there is at what I do. And what I do best isn't very nice. Kayla studies the side of his face for a moment. LOGAN Maybe he's right. Maybe it's the only thing I'm good for. Kayla watches him. Logan shakes his head as if ridding himself of an errant thought. LOGAN Son of a bitch had me thinking about it for a minute. He wraps his arm around her shoulders and pulls her closer. f CONTTN11Fn1Most guys don't have to worry about gutting their girlfriend when they have a bad dream.A gift? Logan shakes his head, staring at the black ribbon of road. LOGAN You can return a gift..I look like Elvis.Full moon tomorrow.Never trust a guy named Trickster.Koo-koo-choo got screwed.T love you, too.Bullet didn't kill this bear.Come on, you're okay. Say something. Say something, darling. Say something. Kayla, come on. He cradles her in his arms. LOGAN You're okay. You're okay.Where is he?Where is he?Three years I been here. Three years everything's good. Nobody knows me. And then one day you show up and the next day she's dead.You knew he was coming. f CONTTNfJRD 1What list? Stryker chokes, gasping for air. Logan eases up on his grip but doesn't release the man. Stryker takes a deep breath.How did he get it?Creed's a mutant, too.I'm not in the Army anymore.I'm gonna track him down and I'm gonna end him. That's the plan.The hell you planning on doing to me? Hines gives Stryker a worried look but he ignores her.Never wanted to put these on again.You ready for me, Doc?See you on'the other side. One of the technicians fastens a breathing tube, connected to an oxygen tank, to Logan's mouth. Logan lies down, submerging himself in the cold water. The technician clamps Logan's wrists and ankles into place with stainless-steel shackles bolted to the plexiglass walls. Logan's eyes are open as he watches the robotic arms swivel into place, poised above him like a gang of metal vipers.Sorry... It's a little cold out there.That's probably it.No sir.Pretty rough, yeah.Sorry if I scared her.I've got good circulation. Nice chopper you got out there, by the way. James's face lights up. Logan has found the man's passion.,What is it, '48 Panhead?Those were good people back there. Innocent people. Agent Zero surreptitiously pulls a commando knife from a sheath on his ankle.I got a message for your boss.Get me the Pest Control Division.Why don't you get 'em anyway. And tell 'em Logan's calling. While he waits he watches one of the kids attempt a backside tailslide on the curb. The kid loses his balance and wipes out, skinning his palms on the asphalt.You shouldn't have killed those people. All they were doing was helping a stranger.They had nothing to do with this. You let that mad dog gun 'em down like they were animals.Had enough orders for one lifetime.People like you are always waiting for the next war. You start one with me, Colonel, you better sleep with the lights on. He hangs up the phone and walks to his bike. The skateboard punks give him a wide berth.You're way out of my league, darlin'.Not tonight. The redhead purses her lips.I know exactly what I'm missing. The courtesan waits at the green light,. watching Logan speed off into the night -You talk tough for a guy who always let me do the dirty work. A slow smile creases Wraith's face. He turns.You tryin' to insult me?I'm looking for Victor Creed. Wraith's face goes serious at the mention of the name. He looks around the gym, making sure no one's watching them. He glances at the boxers in the ring, who lean on the ropes and breathe heavily, awaiting instructions.Always.What's Weapon X? They tap glass.You know about it. Wraith sits behind his desk and puts his boots up. Logan sits across from him.I did. Woke up one day and knew I was done. Logan peels the label from his bottle of beer. f CONTTNTTFT) )What kind of plans?Creed did government work?Help me find him.Just tell me where to start looking. I'll do the rest. Wraith taps the bottleneck, considering.The prison he busted out of?Nope.You think he's still in touch with Creed? f C_ONTTNTIRT)1Jesus, Dukes... Dukes, mouth and chin dusted with fried pork skin, turns his head to examine the pest standing next to him. LOGAN Maybe it's time to give the pork rinds a rest. Dukes swings his arm. Despite his enormous mass, the man moves with surprising speed. Not quick enough to catch Logan, though, who ducks beneath the blow. Dukes's forearm, thicker than a fire hydrant, smashes through the steel shelving. Bags of pork rinds and potato chips tumble to the floor. Snikt! Logan shows his glittering claws to the big man. LOGAN I'll fillet you standing, fat man. That what you want? Dukes hesitates. That is not what he wants., LOGAN .Where's Victor Creed? Dukes grunts and bulls forward, toppling the heavily-laden shelves into the next aisle. Panicked SHOPPERS scream and run for the exits. Dukes blasts through the cereal aisle, too, with a great rending of steel, his giant shoes crushing boxes of Lucky Charms as he stomps into the produce section. CONPTNi)F.T)1Come on, he's your friend. When was the last time you talked to him?Careful, Dukes. I can smell a lie before you even tell it. The Blob begins to cry, the great bellows of his cheeks trembling, tears and snot dribbling down his face.All right, take it easy. Dukes blows his nose into the handkerchief, one of history's loudest and most violent nasal ejaculations. He offers back the soiled handkerchief. Logan waves it off. LOGAN It's a gift. Dukes takes a deep breath, gathering himself.The club for mutants? Down in New Orleans?Nah. You know more than that. Dukes tilts his face, trying to keep his face from getting scraped off.He better be there, Freddie. And he better know something good.Wild roses for the moon.Something like that. You seen my buddy Barbarus? The dealer points toward a staircase at the back of the club.Trust me, bub-- you don't. Logan heads for the staircase.I'm on the list. Logan. The skinhead raises his clipboard and examines the list.Unknown.I came back. Where is he?What's that?He's killing mutants, bub. Barbarus smiles, twenty fingers drumming on the table top.You got that right. Snikt! Barbarus shoves his girlfriend out of the way and stands, unsheathing three more black commando knives from his belt. The other MUTANTS quiet down, watching the fireworks. Barbarus swings, the four knives whistling through the air. Logan ducks under them and continues to bob and weave as Barbarus advances behind a whirlwhind of black steel. Logan slashes and one severed hand falls to the ground. Barbarus howls, stabbing at Logan with his three good arms. Logan's claws flash through the air again, and another neatly severed hand lands on the table. Logan retracts his claws and curls one finger: come at me. Barbarus, shamed and furious, gathers himself and charges. Logan times his punch perfectly, pivoting on the ball of his foot and hitting Barbarus with an uppercut that sounds like a well-hit baseball. Barbarus crashes to the floor. Pantera hisses and pounces at Logan, her black claws aimed at his face. Logan backhands her. She hits the floor and slides across the hardwood. C_nWTTAATFT)No? Way I hear it, you two were practically boyfriends before he busted out.You're lying to me. Barbarus grins, his teeth red from the blood in his mouth.Pour yourself a cup of tea. Hines spins around. Logan sits at the kitchen table, an unlit cigar in his mouth. LOGAN It's gonna be a long night.Careful, Doc. I can smell a lie. I can hear it. Maybe you start to sweat a little bit. Maybe the pitch of your voice changes. But I'll know.Nope. But I know exactly what I'll do to you. IYou're not innocent, Doc. He leans forward, forearms on the tabletop. LOGAN What does Victor Creed have to do with the Weapon X program?So where does Weapon X fit in? Hines closes her eyes and takes a deep breath.Creed works for Stryker. Hines nods. I CONTTNi]RMJust following orders, huh?All this time I been hunting Creed, and he's just a puppet. It's Stryker pulling the strings. He stubs out his cigar on the breakfast table. LOGAN You ready to stop following orders?Were you aiming for every speed bump in the state?We find a uniform that fits. A well-built SERGEANT walks toward his vehicle, paging through requisition papers on a clipboard. LOGAN That ought to work.I barely hit the guy. They don't notice as a small security camera near the entrance pivots, its black eye watching the intruders.I can smell him. He walks through the door. Hines checks to see if the coast is clear.and follows him. Neither notices the security camera mounted on the ceiling, swiveling to track their movement.It's Creed... He looks inside another tank. Same cruel face, same powerful body. Only their shaved heads distinguish them from Victor Creed. LOGAN They're all Creed.They get into the world, it's genocide.Don't follow me. Hines stops, standing alone in the middle of the Eleven.Who are you?No I don't.You're dead.Why? IPrison... Kayla finally raises her head-and looks directly at Logan.You told me he died of a heart attack.You loved me. I know you loved me. Kayla blinks and looks away.No one's that good.You're a mutant?Good.That story you told me... about the guy who goes to get flowers for the Moon. I can't get it out of my head. Except I had it all backwards. I thought you were the moon and I was your Wolverine. But you're the Trickster, aren't you?You didn't trick me into loving you.The last two months, you weren't playing around in my skull. You weren't using. your powers on me. I thought you were dead and I loved you more than ever. Maybe it makes you feel better to think it was all fake. But it was never fake for me. Kayla lowers her eyes.I know exactly what is was like. I come from there too.Course you did. You still do. Kayla stares down at Logan. The tenderness returns to her face. She could free him right now if she wanted. The moment passes and Kayla shakes her head.Yeah, you keep saying that. Come on. Turn on the juice. Let's get this over with.That all you got?I would have done anything for you.Do you hear me? Anything. 1The woman said no. Creed turns his head and sees Logan and Kayla standing in the doorway. He grins and tosses Hines aside. She crashes into the wall and slides to the floor, dazed.This is the end.Time you quit picking on girls.This is for the ones who couldn't fight back.I don't want him hypnotized. I want him dead. Never taking his eyes off his enemy, Logan advances.Get the hell out of here.Bringin' down the house. He sweeps his claws clean through the pillar, at an angle. The uppermost section shears off and drills into the floor with a concussive whump that spiderwebs the concrete for thirty feet around the impact site. Stryker realizes what Logan is doing.Unless someone comes along who can move a few million tons of steel, they ain't going anywhere.Almost looks peaceful from here.", "clean_line": "kid kayla runs

I believe you know my colleague? Logan and Agent Zero stare at each other. There is a history between these two and clearly the memories are not fond. STRYKER We're with the Department of Agriculture now.Boys, please. Could we take a minute of your time?We want you back. Logan turns away from them. He tosses aside the axe, picks up a load of firewood and . stacks. it beside the cabin. STRYKER You're a born warrior. You can hide up here as long as you want, that's never gonna change.It's... creative work, I can assure you of that. And it pays well.We're putting together a team. Best men in the business. Men with... special qualities. Men like you.It's a team of hunters. We're going after some very bad people. Logan climbs into the driver's seat. STRYKER You read the papers, Logan? They're killing mutants. Logan closes the door, turns the key and revs the engine to warm it. Stryker taps on the window. Logan grits his teeth and rolls down the window, not looking at the colonel. STRYKER Listen to me. They have names. They have addresses.All right, forget about yourself. Your country needs you.His name is Victor Creed. Logan turns and sees Stryker standing at the entrance to the operating room. STRYKER I can help you find him.He escaped from an ultramax penitentiary in Nevada last year. Started murdering mutants. Shape- changer in New Mexico, pair of telekinetic twins in California-- Logan turns on Stryker, grabbing the colonel by the throat and shoving him against a lamp post.I came to warn you--He got the List.The List. Every known mutant in North America. Government's been keeping it for years. Names, addresses, everything.Someone must have leaked it to him. There are people in Washington who want to see you all destroyed. Logan releases Stryker. The ex-colonel straightens his jacket collar and composes himself.Apparently he doesn't have much tribal loyalty. Logan turns and walks away. He looks like a homeless man, his clothes torn and bloodied, his hair disheveled. He walks fast. Stryker calls after him. STRYKER Do you have a plan, Captain?Do you have a plan? CnNTTNT TF.Tf 1You already tried that. He's a hundred miles away and you're walking out of the hospital. Logan's fists are clenched. He's ready to hammer Stryker into the ground, but the older man does not back down. STRYKER You can't beat him. Not the way you are right now. You've probably gone your whole life without losing a fight, but I'm telling you now, you can't beat him.Could you unsheath your claws? Logan raises his left hand. The bone claws pop out, the same length they were before Creed shattered them. STRYKER Remarkable. Full regeneration. Logan examines the markings on his forearm.We're going to make you indestructible. But first we have to destroy you. Stryker heads for the door but stops midway and turns. STRYKER I forgot to give you something. He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out an old set of dog tags and tosses them to Logan. Logan inspects the tags with ambivalence.Held on to them for years. Figured you'd be back one day. Logan slips the steel chain over his head. STRYKERAd nauseam, Lieutenant.He can handle the pain.No other animal would survive the experiment.Correct. Some experiments succeed, some fail. That's why we call them \"experiments.\"The man's well-being is not my concern. Proving that the science works-- that's what matters. Hines does not relish confrontation and she's afraid of Stryker. But she gives it one more try.You also swore. to protect your nation. You remember that oath, Lieutenant Hines?I don't need you to understand. I need you to follow orders. Stryker continues down the corridor, leaving Hines standing alone in the fluorescent light.You're witnessing medical history in the making. We've begun bonding adamantium to Weapon X's skeleton.It took us three years to prepare enough alloy for the skeleton.If this works, General, Weapon X will walk wherever he wants.Remains to be seen. We're in uncharted territory here.We need the Eleven. Our victory in the war to come depends on it.Oh, it's coming, General. The enemy walks among us. We'd better be prepared.He's a warrior, Hines. He can handle it. Victor Creed plunges his clawed hand into Logan's gut.On the contrary. The probe is diamond-tipped. It's not hard enough to penetrate adamantium.You're trained to care for humans, Doctor. Weapon X is not one of us.Easy now.Magnificent.He's got nowhere to run. Closed circuit monitors show Logan running down a tunnel. STRYKER The only exit is a 25 ton blast door. It was built to withstand a nuclear detonation.Alert the containment team. Bring him back. (( r)NTTNTJF.J) )Either way. Just bring him back.These soldiers are the creme de la creme. They're equipped to handle the situation.There's a high-voltage fence on the perimeter of the base--Negative. Come back to base.You don't have the weaponry...Nord, goddamnit--Where are you?You ran on me, goddamnit. We had a deal. Now you get back to base--I'm giving you an order, soldier! Return tobase--We're bringing you in. One way or another, we're bringing you in. Logan bows his head, considering his next words.we have information that he was in Las Vegas two nights ago. We'll find him soon.I disagree. I'd say the experiment has been a success.Weapon X is a prototype. Nothing more. He's the walking proof that enhanced skeletons are viable. That, along with the healing factor we've replicated from his blood, will insure that the Eleven is capable of protecting our species from extinction.Disappointing, General. Expected, but still... disappointing.You're having a massive heart attack, sir. Leading cause of death for men in your age bracket. The general gasps for air, trying to rise to his feet. In his death throes, he knocks the glass of water from the table. It shatters on the floor. STRYKER. The war is coming. It's time to choose sides. The general collapses-and Stryker stands above him, staring down at the dying man with pitiless eyes. STRYKER You chose treason.Good.Hines?They won't kill him?A blank slate... easy to train. Stryker fondles the shining bullet lovingly. STRYKER She's a pretty little thing.Mm?Oh, he's coming back, Doctor. We have what he's looking for.Hello, old friend. We've been waiting for you. Logan walks toward the desk, slowly now, a man in a nightmare he can't wake from. STRYKER Did you really think we just let you walk away three years ago? You're a dangerous man, my friend. We like to keep an eye on dangerous men. When Logan reaches the young woman he puts his hand on her shoulder. Kayla Silverfox turns and stares up at him, tears streaming down her face.She's real, old friend. Your eyes are telling you. Your ears. Your nose. Logan ignores Stryker, staring at the love of his life.I asked you nicely to join the program. And you were so stubborn. But I knew if nothing else could motivate you, revenge would. Stryker smiles at Kayla, a proud professor beaming at his student. STRYKER Tell him. Tell him about the day you died. Kayla, head bowed, is silent for a long count. When she speaks her voice is a strange monotone, devoid of feeling.Everybody's a sucker for something. Figuring out what it is, that's the trick. For you, it's a woman's love. An easy weakness to forgive. But still a weakness. Stryker signals to Cornelius. The doctor and his assistant attach a nasty-looking copper halo to Logan's skull. The halo is wired to the electric chair. Logan never takes his eyes off Silverfox. STRYKER Don't be angry at her. She was just serving her country, keeping the mutant menace in check. She and victor have been a real credit to their race. It takes Logan a moment to understand this comment.She's a gifted girl. She can plant thoughts in anyone's mind, make them believe what she wants-- as long as she stays focused on them. He strokes her long dark hair, proud of his protege. Kayla doesn't seem thrilled by Stryker's touch, but she endures it. STRYKER A useful tool in a seduction.So, Logan... The truth is, you're a real pain in the ass. But we've invested far too much time and treasure to terminate you. We're starting over. Cornelius checks the digital gauges on the machine.Let me know when he's clean. I have to look in on our other guest. Stryker exits the room, followed by Victor.Lieutenant. Victor and I were just discussing how to kill you and we thought you might have some suggestions.When the Turks captured a traitor, they strapped a steel basket to the man's stomach. Inside the basket was a rat.Now, even a rat can't chew through steel. But it can chew through a stomach. So it would. Right through the skin and the fat and the muscle and the intestines, right on out the other side. l CDNTTNi7ET) IEnjoy yourself.We are. We're saving humanity.Yes?I want the Eleven combat ready. 1I want them ready! The Lead Technician flinches and barks orders to his subordinates, who enter commands into their computers. The lids of ten thousand isolation tanks slide open. As the camera roams among the Eleven, needles and hoses detach from their bodies, releasing their metallic grip. The cloned Creeds begin to stir in their stainless steel coffins.Activate the PA system. The Lead Technicians flips a switch. Stryker speaks into a microphone; his voice booms from speakers mounted on the pillars throughout the cavern. STRYKER Soldiers! The Eleven snap to attention with machined synchronicity, all ten thousand facing Stryker.The man's committing suicide. He leans into the microphone. The Eleven listen to their commander's voice, amplified by hundreds of speakers STRYKER No army that ever marched could stand against you! You will never abandon your mission, and your mission is simple! Kill the mutants! Kill them wherever you find them! Stryker points at Logan.
