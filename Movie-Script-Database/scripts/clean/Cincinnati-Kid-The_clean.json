{"Cincinnati-Kid-The": {"KID": {"raw_line": "Thanks.Don't seem like he'd bet out without something better than the sixes, does it? Cost me every cent I've won since yesterday afternoon. But I tell you, I got this stubborn streak. Call the ninety-four dollars.Oh, I'm not claiming anything that fine. Just enough to beat the pair of sixes.You better watch those loose lips of yours, you want to have any teeth left behind them -- Buster.I called you on account of I didn't think you had another pair or another six and I know a punk like you would get greedy and try and buy the last hand.Drop it.Hey!Hey, Hoban.Business opportunity come along. Something too good to pass up.Yeah, did okay. Except I almost had it took back.I got to build my stake, Aren't enough chances in this town to let one go.For nickels and dimes... Thing is I've about used up St. Louis.Been thinking about Miami. There's nothing to keep me here.Yeah? The Man himself, here in St. Louis -- I might just stick around Shooter.I ain't exactly been hiding it.Well I got to know.Sometime or other we got to find out how much juice we got.You ever sit down with him?Well, what happened?You lost.I heard about him.What happened?Yeah?You think I'm ready?Oh.No, I ain't. I can't.I don't figure to take him right away. But if I can hang in there long enough, I can outlast him. If I can outlast him, I got a chance. You admit that, don't you, that I got a chance?Did you think you were ready when you sat down with Whistling Sam Magee?Well, I don't think I'm just a cocky square with a fair hand with cards. I got something.Okay. And I ain't saying that you was either when you sat down with Whistling Sam Magee.Well, would you say if I got any chance at all?But then everybody'd see he wasn't right and it wouldn't prove nothing. Listen, we got to have it understood. If he's not right, we call it off till he is.I got to. You said yourself I got to. I'm overdue.I gotta find out.I wish you would, Shooter Man.Hey, what if he turns me down?You think he knows I'm around?I wouldn't want to wait around too long. I want to get in and get it over with.Oh, well, if he's tooling a dollar, I can understand that. Sure.Close to three grand.Well, school's out. I damn sure don't want no lessons. I want everything he's got.No, I won't be ready. Not for a while.Might even turn out we don't go.Yeah, I'm feeling a little different.It's all right. You don't have to act like a cat. You're not bothering me.No. I'm overtired, that's why I can't sleep. Why can't you sleep?'Kay. Can't hurt to try it.What did you do with yourself this time?In French?Sure. Majored in man-eating.I didn't know you ran with The Shooter's woman.And been around more. A lot more. What was the movie like?American pictures.What was it about?Nothing weird about that.That don't make much sense.Including the husbands and fathers? Don't they suspect?Then they got their heads screwed on straight. Honor's just an idea. You can't see or feel it and you can't eat it and you sure as hell can't get any mileage on it.Have a drink with us?In my life?I slept okay.No I don't mind -- What she was talking about, Shooter's woman -- I'm going up against a big game soon.Yes.Why? What's the matter?Thought what?I wouldn't be able to spare you much change.Would a hundred fish do it? For the bus and something nice to bring your Mama?When would you want to go?Unless what?Do you want to? Would you like it?You want dessert?Coffee?Neither do I.You still haven't said it.If you're coming back.What's to see?Oh.Promise?Oh, I see.I don't think that's why you're going -- because you like it so much better in the country.Well, I've got that big game.Yes. If I won, there would be a lot of money.I'm sorry.I'll go down to the bus with you.I'll go down with you.Yeah?Sure.Hell, it's the only thing I know how to do. What else is there for a guy never finished school? College graduates are walking the streets looking for jobs -- trained people, engineers, scientists!When you're The Man, you don't have to hustle -- When you're The Man, The Best, the Big Money comes around on their knees just beggin' to hustle you. I'm not goin' to quit. I'm goin' to win.Well you see how it is.Christian, you aren't doing this to be off my back, in case I lose?And this just helped you decide.Then don't go.I wish it could be more.I don't guess I will either.If I win, it won't be good enough. If I lose, I lose it all.Goodbye, Christian.Christian's gone home to see her folks.Hi, Hoban. Sokal. Pig.Not with who's coming up. I'll take the same odds.Guess I will.I don't think --Any special reason?Sure you are. You're The Shooter's woman.First place, Old Shooter'll come barging through that door any minute. He said they were winding it up.Also it don't mean anything to you, you're Christian's friend?You know damn well how good it was. Where's a pack of cards?Gin or casino, you name it. All I know is we're switching to another indoor sport.Thanks for putting it together for me.Listen, Melba --I wish it was sooner. I wish it was tomorrow.I don't like waiting that long.Listen, what I was going to say before, I don't want you to think I'm being some kind of jerk or I don't feel you'd be great to sack up with.I've made dolls that were friends of mine's wives. I figured if they were willing, they were doing it to their husbands, I wasn't.Only thing is, it's different with The Shooter than anybody else. He's so straight, I got the obligation to be straighter with him than other people. So do you. On account of we both owe him plenty.Can't be. Shooter's the closest thing to family I got. It's almost like he was my old man. Don't you see how that's got a bearing on us?No, thanks.No.Play what?Yes, I'm ready.Thank you very much. That was nice. Where did you learn to do that?Who is Herman?Is he a good friend?Well, I don't want a shine, but here's fifteen cents.-- Yeah.Monday night.Thanks, Jansen. Hey!Just tell The Shooter I'll be there on the dot Monday night.He doesn't have to know.Can I help you with those?Fine.Monday.I'm all right. Bus stopped for doughnuts and coffee.Where is Mr. Craigie?I think I will. I think I'd like that. Okay?How do you do, Mr. Craigie. I'm Eric Stoner.That's right.She's helping her mother can.You got any objections if I do, or if I don't?It was what I call a sharp question.I'm what's known as a three-river man. Which just means I go around playing stud poker wherever I can find the kind of action I'm looking for.Yeah. I was playing in this game in the hotel and she was a waitress in the coffee shop. We went out. I told her I thought she could get a better job in St. Louis.I said it because I wanted her in St. Louis. Anyway, she made it there and she called me and we been seeing each other ever since.Yeah, living together.Not that I know of.No.Think so? Well, you've known her longer than me. Look, Mr. Craigie, let me and Christian find out a few things then maybe I won't have to answer your questions.That's all right. I don't understand farmers.Well I can't take into account what somebody's going to feel every time I say something.In some things.That's a tough one. I don't disbelieve in Him, but I couldn't say I believed in Him either. I guess I just never paid Him much mind. Didn't seem important.I don't mean what He does isn't important -- if He exists. I mean it's not important to me whether He exists or not.Is that so? I didn't know --- I'm not aware of the difference. I'm not asking permission to marry Christian, you know.If I was, the only person I'd be asking it from is her.He's the king of the stud poker players.Yes.I'm this good. The Man has got to play me.Then I'm The Man.I been trying to figure that out ever since I set it up.Not really.No, it's necessary, but it isn't so important.Ambition -- maybe security, like that.I ain't looking for security if that's what you mean.That would figure into it. But that isn't all of it. -- It's important to me.If you got the guts to ask that question, Mr. Craigie, I guess I got the guts to answer it. Christian, if you came right down to it, is not as important as doing what I have to do.Know what?Thanks. I'll tell her.We liable to draw an audience?I told him on account of he already knew. Never any sense feeding a man a lie he's not going to believe.Hey, you're all wet!The technical term is \"suckers.\" Or \"marks.\"Not right. That's cheating and it's not any part of what we're talking about.I'll show you.You see one of these cards is white on both sides, one is red on both sides, and the other is white on one side, red on the other.This. I put the three cards in a hat and shake them up, and then I ask you to draw one card out blind. Put it face down on the table so neither of us can see the bottom side.Okay, red on top. That eliminates the all-white card, right. So the card you've picked is one of two -- the all-red or the red-and-white. One out of two is an even chance, an even-money proposition. Right -- you follow me?So if I said I'll bet you a dollar to seventy-five cents the other side of that card is red, you'd take the bet wouldn't you?And that answer makes you a sucker. Because the odds are two to one, the other side of that card is red, and I ought to be offering you a dollar to fifty cents instead of seventy- five.There are three possibilities. That can be the red side of the red- and-white card, or it can be either side of the all-red card. In two cases out of three the other side is red. And I'd win the bet from you two out of every three times we made it.Sure. It's obvious when I explain it, isn't it?Take my word for it -- the odds are two to one. And knowing that is the difference between your gambling man and your sucker. Not who gets the better cards but who knows what the proper odds are. In a poker game there can be a million different situations, each with a different set of odds to figure. The man who ends up winners is the man who knows when to bet and how much...Sure -- like if you grow better corn or raise a cow that gives more milk than the other guy's. Or two business men are in competition, or two lawyers are up against each other in a courtroom. Whatever your line is, the one who wins out is the one who knows his job better.There is -- Making the man you're playing against think he's got the best hand -- and making him pay to find out.I'm the one can't stay. I got to head for that bus.Well, hell, I don't know. I had kind of a rough time after you left.Tuesday there was a ball game, but then the Cardinals went on the road. I never known time to drag so; I was all torn apart --That's how I read it, but I was reading it wrong. It wasn't Lancey or the game that was chewing at my insides --I finally figured it. I located where the trouble was. It was you.When you talk about doing something besides poker if I get to be The Man, you don't mean pass up the chance to make some dough from it for a while?You were going to do some thinking down here.I'll be back after the game Christian -- You wait here for me and I'll let you know.I got that made now. You said it right. My time's come.Once more around the square.I intend to take Shooter right along with Lancey.You think I'll be sorry I come?Lancey. I been looking forward a long time.What do you say, Yeller? Still feeling salty with me?I hustled a couple of boys, right in his territory.And I tried to tell him how I got no prejudice. When I'm on the edge of my stake, I hustle anybody at all, regardless of race, creed or color. Anybody at all.Hell, I figured I was doin' you a favor.Great. You?Whatever you say, Lancey. You're the -- You're our guest in this town.I think we ought to be able to get a game together in this crowd.Thanks. I'll do that.It's solid, that's what counts. And you got the top fixed perfect.Fine, excellent. Okay with you?Sure has.Good a time as any.I don't know him.'Kay, fine. Don't worry about it, Lancey. Who's sitting down with us, Shooter?'Kay, fine.I don't mind stud poker if that's okay with you.'Kay with us.I'm in.Nines bet twenty bucks.His woman's been giving him a rough time. Wants him to quit and go square.Thanks, Lancey.Yeah. Nice-looking broads.That was a pretty thing to watch what you done to Pig with those jacks.When he bet out first, he was ready to think you had them back to back. Even when he bet the size of the pot, he figured there was still a chance you were laying for him. But when you called him, I could see it in his eyes he thought you had jacks and tens, and I knew you had him hooked.Oh, sure, I seen what you were pulling all along.Not yet.You mean it?I heard.I'd like to make it out there.I generally stick to stud.Oh, I do that. I'll take a night off and shoot a little casino. Or even blackjack.That's interesting. I could go for bridge if there was a way to do it without partners.No. We're -- she's gone away for a while. We're not sure we're looking for the same thing.I was hoping Christian would run with me and wouldn't try to make a big deal out of it.Yeah, and now I don't know. I don't figure a man can change his way because the way I see it a man's lucky he's got something going for him that he can hold on to. A man can't change his way for a woman.I been wondering if it isn't maybe a better idea not to look for a fixed thing. Just tie in to something nice when you're away from the action, and enjoy it, and let it wear itself out.Well she didn't understand how it was with me and ---There ain't but a few people, I guess who would understand --Well -- thank you.It's very educational, hearing what it's like for a man your age.That sounds good to me. I didn't think you was coming in at me like a grudge match.It's yours.Yeah, just the two of us. Deal them, Shooter Man.Cost you a grand.Kings up.Call two thousand.Take it. I can't beat three sevens. I'd like a break to get some food and sleep -- I'm winners so it isn't up to me to say it but I'm saying it anyway.There's nothing to talk about.I'm taking my half hour to raise my stake.I can raise it.Long as you know. -- Call.No -- I'm through.Thanks.Where's Christian?Yeah.

you could fix me up. In that department.You're looking for a clout in the head if you don't keep your face to the road.Mr. Schlaegel? How are you? And your enchanting wife?... Tomorrow is quite convenient... I generally prefer stud but you name it... Your stakes are my pleasure, sir... Thank you, why don't we make it after lunch? My diet these days is enough to spoil anyone else's appetite... A pleasure, sir. Please remember me to your charming wife.How could you guess, Shooter? I was invited by a Mr. William Schlaegel --As he put it, rather bluntly, I felt, we don't want everyone to have to watch everyone else dealing to see to it they don't make any little accidental errors by mistake. I told him a man couldn't ask for a better guarantee of a fair-and-square game than having The Shooter deal it. So if you're willing, we're meeting at two o'clock in the afternoon. Ask for Mr. Schlaegel's suite at the Park Sherman... Good. I'm glad you can do it, Shooter. Be a pleasure to see you again... Oh pretty much the same... Just have to be a little careful about smoking and drinking and eating -- and breathing. See you tomorrow. Good night.Check.And up two.Queen high.I recollect a young fellow putting the same question to Eddie the Dude. It was a game in the grand lounge of the \"J.M. White, Third,\" the largest paddle-wheeler ever built. \"Son,\" Eddie told him, \"All you paid was the looking price. Lessons are extra.\" First time I heard of this Cincinnati Kid was in New Orleans, at Yeller's. I knew right away I'd have to play him someday.I may admire it. But if he's all that good, I doubt if I'll enjoy it.I've learned to take everything in moderation.Well now, son, you're quite welcome. Can't say I recall another man, in all my days on the three rivers, who seemed to find it quite so pleasurable losing all that money.Sure, sure. Haven't seen the dear old bitch in fifteen years.Yes, that's how it usually comes out in the long run. You think this boy is going to give me trouble, Shooter?I don't want it to be one of those marathon games. Not any more.Sure, sure. Longest game I ever played though, I was a kid on my way to the Klondike gold rush. At Soapy Smith's in Skagway. Four nights and three days.Depends how you look at it. When we wound up, the Yukon River had frozen over and you couldn't get through to Dawson City till the following June. Made myself a Hundred and fifty bucks and missed the gold rush.That is undeniably true. But it doesn't mean I'm ready to retire. How old is this boy of yours?Well, now, makes me feel a whole lot better, knowing that. I was thirty- six when I sliced up Eddie the Dude. This Kid of yours is just going to have to wait a few years.It's a friendly town, St. Louis. I've always said that.Climate, Shooter. In my declining years, I spend more and more time in Florida and the Gulf Coast.What reason is that, Lady Fingers?Should I be scared of him?Thanks for the warning.Hello, Kid. Pleasure to know you.Sure, sure. You seem to know about everybody. Yeller from New Orleans?No, I hadn't heard.How you feel, Kid?The best. You think maybe we ought to see if we can stir up some action?Well, I'm kind of in the mood to play a little cards.But first you take a look at things -- make sure everything's the way you want it. I already been around.Light all right for you?Sure, sure. Shooter's set us up just great.Why not?St. Louis Bridge Club, eh? Steward still that old yard bird Okra?Old stud man, Okra.Quite a character. Quite a character.Been ten years since I seen or spoke to Old Okra.Sure, sure. Shall we have a look at the decks?Well, Kid, what's your game?I got no objections to stud. Gentlemen?Privilege of age. Can't take the glare of the morning sun in my eyes.Why, yes, Shooter. Creme de menthe frappe. Green.Fine, Shooter man.Five grand? Nice, tidy sum. I'll put out the same.Ten dollars.Ace bets ten dollarsNew deck.Pair of jacks will venture a hundred dollars.Check to the sevens.In for nine eighty.I'll call your twenty-four hundred --Comes to fourteen hundred fifty dollars, Pig. Don't imagine you'll have any problem promoting that much in half an hour -- plus whatever you care to raise me.He wants to wish anybody luck, doesn't bother me. Personally, I don't figure The Kid needs it.Who? Oh, Spider Man, sure, sure.Good crowd.That's a fact.Thanks, Kid. From you, that's nice to hear.You knew, did you? Before I raised?You been to Miami, Kid?Beautiful town, lot of loose money around. You ought to come down some time.Sure, sure. Lot of room down there. Another spot you ought to work someday is Reno, Nevada.You got to have nerves though. So much going on. Action everywhere you turn. You lose the feel of the cards when you're in so much action day in, day out.There's different levels of action there -- you'd find yours, any kind you could ask for.Sure, sure, for eating money. But you know how it is, I like to lay off once in a while and try craps. Nothing serious -- I don't even think of it as work.Your age, you don't need a regular vacation every year. But me, I have to forget the grind for a couple of weeks. I go to this place near Delray Beach, and the whole time I don't play anything but bridge.I'm not keeping you from your woman, am I?I'm sorry to hear that.But she tried?Nooo, a man can't do that.That's very interesting you should say that. You're pretty young to have figured things out already.Between us?Kid, you're the best stud man I've seen in 35 years of action. You know that?And when it comes to broads, which is getting to be an academic problem -- I can look back now to the two or three I ever considered I might want to spend the rest of my life with, and you know what? I like it... looking back on them, that is -- I always got a lot of companionship out of a good book.Glad to be of help. And it's good we had this little talk so I know we can be friends regardless what happens.No room for any kind of emotion in a fair game of stud. I learned that a long time ago.You're still good, Fingers.No, I didn't hear.No, can't say that I have.What have you got?Ace-king-queen high.Well, just the two of us.Compulsory call, Kid.Two pair, jacks up.Two thousand dollars.My dear, that young man is a stud poker-playing son-of-a-bitch.Not yet he isn't.Not yet he isn't. But he damn well might.No stay.No stay.Queen bets another C-note.Well, I don't either.Same deck is good enough.Alright, alright -- A new deck then, Jesus.Looks that way.Make it an hour. Old bones need a little more time to loosen up.What's up?Well, we got Lady Fingers. Or we can deal ourselves.I got to go along with that, Shooter. Lady Fingers! You ready?I can't persuade myself you have the flush.Now I can.I'm not that curious.Two hundred.Fold.Betting the jack isn't there, Kid.Jack is willing to wager two hundred dollars.Call your five hundred and five hundred more.Your five hundred -- and up one thousand.Reasonable bet. Two thousand five hundred. Deal them.Fifty-four hundred bucks is a nice piece of money. I see the bet and raise sixty-seven hundred.I'll take your marker, Kid.I know you can.Straight flush to the jack -- That's $6700 you owe me, Kid.New deck.You're one hell of a poker player, Kid. That was a rough hand.What's the tab for the whole show?Gets down to what it's all about, doesn't it? Making the wrong play at the right time.I don't play a percentage game. I play stud poker my way. And I got the money and you got the questions. Figure that out. You're good. But as long as I'm around, you're second best, Kid... and you might as well learn to live with it.Look me up if you're in Miami after Christmas.

Only with me it was Whistling Sam Magee to New Orleans.Well then you know it all... about 20 years ago it was, maybe more.Why, I lost it. It dried me up on the inside for a long, a very long time.I been where I'm going, know what I mean?Kid, I don't think you're ready.But you're not going to take my word for it, are you? Are you now?I know, I know. You got to find out for yourself.I already said I didn't think you were ready.Kid, I thought I was the best stud poker player in the world. I'm telling you now, I thought I was the best.No, you ain't no cocky square. And you probably got something.If you got the stuff, being a little cocky don't hurt you none.This much of a chance. If Lancey is not right. If he's got a cold, or his stomach ulcer is acting up, or something like that.You're set on a real showdown, aren't you? Your mind's all made up.Yeah, you been around a long time -- I was a lot younger than you when I went up against Whistling Sam -- But you'd be kinda young too, to be The Man.Want me to set it up?All right.He won't, the way I'll spread the word. He'll have to take you on, someone in your class. If he ducked it, that'd make you The Man.He can smell meat like you a mile and a half up the river. He knows you're around and he'll sit down with you. You want to butt heads with The Man, I'll set it up.There's your woman.He must of come to St. Louis for a big money game. I'll probably get asked do I want to deal it for them. And however long that takes, he'll have to rest up for you.You got much of a stake?Work on it. But three grand will give you a ride and even if you don't win, why you'll come away with a good idea of what you're made of. But once you go in Kid you can't quit. You get that straight right now. Two of you go in and only one of you can come out.It's the only way to be, Kid.See you.If you'd rather we put it in my room --Hello?... Well, hello. What brings you to our fair city? Little action, maybe?Owns most of the Schlaegel Brewery. Braumeister beer.Still queens -- possible flush -- no help -- possible flush.You'll enjoy his game.The tougher the competition, the better you used to like it.Four.Hi, Kid. Shooter here. Listen, I told the woman I'd take her to the ball park, but I'm still working. How about you and Christian take her out?Oh. Well listen, would you mind taking her yourself? The gang'll be there, in the section... Thanks. Appreciate it. See you.Lady Fingers'll want to come, I bet, and she's right on the edge of her stake. She could spell me dealing.Well, that's it, then. Monday night, Room Three-Eleven at the Dorset Hotel. And may the best man win.Yeah, he's going to give you trouble.Like the session with The Portugee at Jolly's in Omaha. Remember?You win?You been around a long time.Twenty-six, twenty-eight, something like that.I ought to call my woman.Explain to The Kid, will you?Tell him they decided to play a little longer, and I'll call him at his place later when the game's over... Right. Goodbye, honey.Mrs. Schlaegel. How are you, June. What's it all about, Bill?Great. Whatever.Betting interest?Fifty thousand!I knew you liked The Kid's style but why you going in so deep?But how can you be so sure? The Kid could do it, we both know that, but --Not a chance, Bill. You ought to know I never ever use what I got with the cards for nothing but tricks and dressing up a game.It's out. Out.Understand this, Bill. I'd like for The Kid to win, and I sure as hell don't want to see you lose all that money --OK but I'm paying it off! It's comin' in ain't it? Six grand already. Bill, you got to listen to me --!For God's sake --!Twenty-five years I been building a reputation.I made up my mind to this. I ain't going to give him any help till he needs it.Hey, what if he starts off lucky and stays ahead of the game the whole way. It could happen, you know.We ain't seen much of you though, last seven, eight years.It's an old table. Everything's pretty old in this hotel.Two hundred watt bulb.Thank you, gents. Tried to do the best I could. Cards?Hoban! Okay! You both know Joe Hoban. He's a draw poker man, but clean and straight as they come.Hoban's selling them to us at five dollars a pack, with the usual guarantee. If it's proved any deck is spooked, he pays off the losers.Four of us. Me, Pig, Yeller and Doc Sokal. If that's all right with you both?That's thoughtful of you, Bill.You want to have the usual brandy and coffee on hand, Kid? Anything special for you, Lancey?You got that, Hoban? Gentlemen, if there are no objections, I'm the dealer. These rooms have been contracted for, and there will be an ante of ten dollars per chair, per day. During the breaks for me, Old Lady Fingers has agreed to deal, but she don't care to be a player --Lady Fingers will get three dollars an hour from the ante, plus her room and food, and a five-minute break every hour. Gents?Gentlemen, this is a game of five- card stud poker. There is no limit. A dead man has one half hour to raise his roll outside and get back in the game.Last and certainly least --Seven, nine, trey, nine, ace, and The Shooter guns up a ten. Ace bets.Dealer folds.King to the seven, pair of nines, deuce to the trey, queen-nine, ace- eight.Queen, ten, king, four, ace again, and a king for The Shooter.King over.To the nine a ten, to the queen a seven, to the king a jack, and to the jack a jack.Possible straight flush, pair of sevens. Pair of jacks are still high.Busted, no flush, no straight. Pair of sevens with a queen gets a nine. To the pair of jacks, a trey.Fourteen fifty to the queens. You want to take your half hour, Pig?You Tap City?I thought you and Hilda were quits.See you around, Pig.He shouldn't have said that. Not after taking Tap City from the table.I know it's early, men, but what about taking a little break?Need your help, Lady Fingers... to make arrangements for food and shelter.Bet the pot. Four hundred and twenty dollars.Thanks, gents. Makes me exactly even. This kind of a game, that's a smart place to quit. Just do the dealing, if that's all right with everybody.Ace-king is the high man.Nothing -- what are you talking about?The hell I was. Christ, Kid, even if I was you couldn't spot it -- I'm too good a mechanic for anybody to spot it.You seen it before often enough. One player draws four good ones.My woman told you.Why should you bitch if I give you a little help?Kid, you got to understand. It wasn't my idea --He's got the squeeze on me Kid and he's meaner than hell. He'll cut me up if I don't come through. You think I wanted to deal a phony game? You think it don't mean something to me? I never done a crooked thing before in my life.He's liable to kill me.It is a hell of a chance to take.He ain't goin' to like it.I ride with you.Your fan on the fifth floor wants you to have a bite with him. Alone.You better, Kid. You don't, you're only making worse trouble.I'm okay. What The Kid's talking about is nothing. It's just not important.He's getting to him.We're in -- I think he's got him.He's going for it and The Kid's got him. He's going all the way.Shut up. Sorry, Kid.Well, Kid, it's like I said -- you just wasn't ready.Oh, yes you are -- you and your big mouth -- you're part of it all right.", "clean_line": "hell tell boys holding chair turn profit rough ones lately kid forever coming piece streets getting guys ve hustled hell isn lancey hodges town seeing coming long time kid long time ain hiding sure got know got know tell yes lose good lose set mind play poker certain way kid ve lancey hodges whistling sam magee new orleans know years ago maybe lost dried inside long long time going know mean kid think ready going word know know got said think ready kid thought best stud poker player world telling thought best ain cocky square probably got got stuff little cocky hurt chance lancey right got cold stomach ulcer acting like set real showdown aren mind yeah long time lot younger went whistling sam kinda young man want set right won way ll spread word ll class ducked man smell meat like mile half river knows ll sit want butt heads man ll set woman come st louis big money game ll probably asked want deal long takes ll rest got stake work grand ride win ll come away good idea kid quit straight right come way kid room hello hello brings fair city little action maybe owns schlaegel brewery braumeister beer queens possible flush help possible flush ll enjoy game tougher competition better like hi kid shooter listen told woman ball park working christian oh listen mind taking gang ll section thanks appreciate lady fingers ll want come bet right edge stake spell dealing monday night room dorset hotel best man win yeah going trouble like session portugee jolly omaha remember win long time like ought woman explain kid tell decided play little longer ll place later game right goodbye honey mrs schlaegel june great betting thousand knew liked kid style going deep sure kid know chance ought know use got cards tricks dressing game understand like kid win sure hell want lose money ok paying comin ain grand got listen god sake years building reputation mind ain going help till needs hey starts lucky stays ahead game way happen know ain seen seven years old table pretty old hotel watt bulb thank gents tried best cards hoban okay know joe hoban draw poker man clean straight come hoban selling dollars pack usual guarantee proved deck spooked pays losers pig yeller doc sokal right thoughtful want usual brandy coffee hand kid special lancey got hoban gentlemen objections dealer rooms contracted ante dollars chair day breaks old lady fingers agreed deal care player lady fingers dollars hour ante plus room food minute break hour gents gentlemen game card stud poker limit dead man half hour raise roll outside game certainly seven trey ace shooter guns ace bets dealer folds king seven pair nines deuce trey queen ace queen king ace king shooter king queen seven king jack jack jack possible straight flush pair sevens pair jacks high busted flush straight pair sevens queen gets pair jacks trey fourteen queens want half hour pig tap city thought hilda quits pig shouldn said taking tap city table know early men taking little break need help lady fingers arrangements food shelter bet pot dollars thanks gents makes exactly kind game smart place quit dealing right everybody ace king high man talking hell christ kid couldn spot good mechanic anybody spot seen player draws good ones woman told bitch little help kid got understand wasn idea got squeeze kid meaner hell ll cut come think wanted deal phony game think mean crooked thing life liable kill hell chance ain goin like ride fan fifth floor wants bite better kid making worse trouble okay kid talking important getting think got going kid got going way shut sorry kid kid like said wasn ready oh yes big mouth right"}}}
