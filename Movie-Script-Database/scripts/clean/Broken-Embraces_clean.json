One of these days something awful will happen to you!Diego told me yesterday that you finished the script.I agreed to deliver the definitive version to the producer and director today.I think he was very ill...You look awful ...!I am, I've committed ...Start thinking of the next script. Some kind of horror or fantasy story for bratty teenagers. It's what sells best ...The writer who married Marilyn?And Miller never saw him? ...It's very moving, but I don't think we can write a script about Arthur Miller without procuring rights from the family.It's a beautiful story. But years ago, when you began writing again and I began selling your scripts, you told me you'd never write remakes, sequels, nor biopics. Nor stories whose protagonists were filmI'll get it.You need anything?What are you up to?Then I'll leave you. I'll stop by tomorrow, when I can. I have to finish the budget for the Americans as soon as possible, so that I can decide what to do ... . Ok, we can continue tommorow...Well, he wants to see you this afternoon, or tomorrow, if you can. I have asked him for an advance and he has accepted, but I cannot accompany you either today or tomorrow...Good, I hope you like him, he seems to be loaded.No, just judging from his voice. And from the check I am about to ask him for. I will send Diego over so that you're not alone.It's Judit Garcia.I don't want it! I just sent it back, Ernesto!Artistic? What are you up to?And what does that have to do with Harry?You are not a director!Ernesto, forget about us!Do not come near Harry again. If you ever stop by his house again I will report you for harassment.I am not at all pleased with having to scout outside Madrid, but the Americans pay a bundle and we need money.I am also worried for Harry. Please, look after him during my absence...It's only two weeks!I am worried about Ernesto Junior's visit. I would like for you to be on guard in case he appears or calls and then let me know immediately!He's crazy. I don't trust him.Diego, please, this is not the moment.Hey, if it bothers you so much to look after Harry, I'll quit the job and stay in Madrid! Or I'll hire someone.Too beautiful to be funny.She is Ernesto Martel's lover, the tycoon. She is here with his son.Her? If she's been with him for three years, she must be. In any case, go out and say hello, to be polite. One must get along well with important men. You never know.Little Diego... he could hardly breathe all night... neither of us has slept a wink.Thanks. One more thing, I've talked to the producer.He complains that the shooting is monopolizing Lena.Ernesto is a businessman, not an artist.I warned you! Ernesto Martel doesn't give a crap about this movie and those of us making it, except for one person! This weekend he is taking her to Ibiza with him, so you won't be able to rehearse.Can we stop for those three weeks? With pay for the team, of course.Mateo, say something!Don't say that!Images are the source of his work... and to live in the dark, I suppose that's death to him... Is there any chance he will see?Yes.She was very thankful to Ernesto for having taken care of everything...Yes, they buried her next to her father.Yes.What's wrong?Bundle up! And don't get too close to the water. Don't let go of his hand!I am here to pay Mateo Blanco's bill.It's the man who had the accident. He was in bungalow number two.Yes, of course.Harry! Harry Caine!We have to go, Harry.I was dying to see you! Are you OK, my son?I was very worried about you!Mateo? You're not calling him Harry...?Talking?What about?OK. So what happened to you? I don't know if I should believe the thing about the stomach flu, you two used that as an excuse in a script...What kind of accident?Try to! I am not that stupid!What's wrong with you, Diego?For Mateo...Call him however you wish. That's the advantage of having two names.Wait, my arms are full...Yes! Happy Birthday!Thank you for looking after Diego... I don't know how to thank you!What is wrong with the two of you? Why is it that he suddenly is not calling you Harry but Mateo?Liquid ecstasy?And... what happened... exactly?Diego's a drug addict?But how can one make a mistake with something like that?Well, he hasn't succeeded. At some point he will have to speak to me, no?Is that so? Because I ask him and he doesn't answer!The two of you are acting very differently. Both of you. You both have changed.I have put on some makeup and I am dressed as a woman.I haven't changed much, Harry. I am wearing my hair short.Short, or rather, very short, like that of all fortysomethings who want to appear younger.What is the idea here, Harry?No...Harry, what is all this about?Darkness, in fashion? I don't understand.Yes. Let's toast.Happy Birthday! We must look into each other's eyes.Oh, sorry... It slipped.I don't know what you've been talking about these past days...But I do know what I haven't talked to you about all these years...But you must have asked yourself a thousand times. This is my birthday gift, Mateo. The gift is also for you, Diego.After you disappeared, Ernesto Senior thought only of his revenge. A plan had occurred to him but, to carry it out, he had to bribe, at the very least, both Luis and me. It wasn't an issue, we both sold ourselves without hesitation. Luis and I. With me, he had the courtesy to provide an alibi, he proposed that I leave for a month and a half to the United States, to the Mayo Clinic, so that Diego could undergo a cure for his aspergillosis, that way I wouldn't have to be present while he destroyed the movie . I opted to stay in Madrid and have Diego undergo his cure here. I wanted to witness everything. If I was going to betray you, I wanted to pay the full price...Yes. It was torture to watch Ernesto select the worst takes of each shot and Luis edit them together, turning your film into a monster . The only way of withstanding that was to suffer more.Yes. Now that you once again call yourself Mateo, I have no excuse.I believe you...Ernesto hired various detectives to search for you, but before they found you, you called me, two days after the premier. I was too embarrassed to answer, and... too stunned. I still am. When Ernesto Senior asked me again about you, I don't know why, I gave him the phone number for Famara...He was the one who found you after the accident and called the hospital...No! But I can't stop thinking that had I not given his father the phone number, perhaps nothing would have happened...I don't know...Good night. Call me if you need anything...It's a panic attack... Hand me the purse!I will sleep well with this...Here? What for?Thank you. I am feeling better... and I'll fall asleep soon.How impressive!Yes, don't worry about last night. It's horrible, but it only happens occasionally and I know how to stop it...Yes.If I don't tell you now, I may never do so... At the end of the eighties, in `77, to be exact.Yes, in the year of punk, Mateo and I became involved...Yes... We were just getting started in film, and we are still at it, but our love affair ended, at least on his side... That didn't keep us from working together... until now...There's one more thing... Mateo is your father...No... I... can hide things... but I never make things up... I don't know how to make up... The fleeting lover existed, he was gay and our affair was short-lived. His name was Vicente and it was while I was with him that you were conceived, but your biological father was Mateo, not Vicente.No. At that time, he asked me and I denied it, of course. I didn't want to put pressure on him, I didn't want our relationship to change because of it. After all, I had never asked him if he wanted to become a father.Who?What did he want?That I call him? Why in the world have you not awakened me?!Diego has told me to call you. Are you OK? Do you need anything?Let me explain...What are you doing at Ernesto's house?Mateo, stop talking crazy!My God! Wait a second... I have something to tell you.In effect, Ernesto Senior asked for it to be destroyed.Yes. In any case, sooner or later the lab disposes of all the material... and that was many years ago.As the film's producer I was the only one who had access to the lab... to all the material. After I gave the order to have everything destroyed, I intercepted it. And I kept it. I have all of it at home.I didn't tell you this last night because I didn't realize you wanted to edit it. I took everything, all the double takes, the internegative, the sound tapes... Everything! You can have it whenever you want!Please, get out of that place, leave Ernesto alone.

Now, all that's left is for me to enjoy life . . .I would like to add a final epilogue. It may not be necessary, but I'd like to write it.You will have it by tomorrow, don't worry.Ernesto Martel has died.It's been so long since we've spoken of him!And it's Monday! Diego, you don't have to run for me. We are not in a hurry.You'll have it by tonight, don't worry.I don't know if I'll know how to. I was thinking of developing a story inspired by Arthur Miller's son...One day, Miller was giving a conference in defense of a mentally retarded man, who had been condemned to death, after what was believed to be a forced confession. Among those present was his mentally handicapped son, who was integrally involved with organizations that aided all sorts of disabled people. The son was very proud to finally be sharing something with his father. At the end of the conference, he approached the stage and held him in an embrace that must have seemed endless to Arthur Miller, who did not know how to extract himself from this mentally handicapped man; imagine, it would not have been politically correct, least of all given the situation in which Miller found himself. Then the stranger let go of him and told him: \"I amWe change the names, the story is not about the writer's miserliness, but about the strength of the son who survives without the least bit of rancor toward the father who has ignored him his entire life. It is a story of troubles overcome and of inherent goodness. There aren't those many good men that one can write about.I can't bear them... It's true, it's true I said all that, but this wouldn't exactly be a biopic...Diego, go to the end of the document.I was going to read an Alice Munro story on the MP3.Who is it?Ray X? There's no such a name.What do you want?It's your first film?It's none of your business.Will you stand there all day?Find it out. She is a well-known Production Director.Tell me.Yes... .I will speak to him... and let you know.Have you seen him?Hello Mr. X. Please, have a seat...Thank you.Is that so? You must be the only one.It would seem that way.Yes . . . I lost track of him some time ago.Whose?Films turn out well or badly. The reason is always a mystery. . But tell me about the story you want to write.Why does the son desire revenge?When you say he is powerful, what kind of power are you referring to?I get it. I am afraid I am not the writer you are looking for.It's too personal.Thanks, but no. And now, if you don't mind...In my case, that would be a miracle.Did you overhear that?Look through the pictures of the `94 shoot. Some of the photographs must have the date on it.Who?It's a 16mm. Are you sure it's him?What am I saying?It's a radio microphone. He is asking me to wear it and I am refusing it.Ernesto Martel's son.You can put them away now...I am training and I don't work at night, nor do I drug myself.That I take care of myself, with the fanaticism of an older, handicapped person.Yes, I am. All of us who survive a critical physical injury are. There is no other way.Why so?You want to donate blood?Yes. It has a good ring.It's true.Your mother would like that story.They control various industries. For example, the one responsible for dark sunglasses...Protected by the sunscreen, they can function all day... The lotion must be as dense as armour.What a great opening! We also need a love story...Like in \"Cat People\", a love story between beings of different species...But they must like sex, right?Why?Aha.And her breasts?And when she sucks his dick?And how does he react? A man may do without kissing, but it's very rough not to have your cock sucked.I like your story very much, Diego.No. This one was your idea, and you'll author it. I'll be your sparring partner, for all the times you've done the same for me...What hospital are you taking him to?...His uncle. I am on my way.I am here to see Diego Garcia. He's just been admitted.I am here to see Diego Garcia.Yes... I'm his uncle, and his godfather.In a coma?But, what has happened?!My God! But Diego is a very healthy boy...If that's the case, I'll wait...I'd rather wait.Yes. Guide me to a place where I can sit, please...He only has a mother and, at the moment, she is working outside Madrid... I would prefer to call her myself... I don't want to alarm her, unless he is truly in a grave condition...Yes, of course...How are you?I don't know. She wanted to hurry back, but I convinced her to continue with the location scouting. At some point you'll have to call her.Are you asleep?Do you want to talk?Would you like me to speak?I say so in order to distract you. When I was young, before I got into making movies, I was very good at telling stories.She's afraid of him?She didn't explain why?It's a long story...We met him... In an office we had rented in preparation for my new film, about fourteen years ago.Ernesto Martel offered to produce the movie. Your mother didn't want him to. She was waiting for a subsidy from the Ministry and an advance sale to television, but that would take months and I was suddenly in a great hurry to begin shooting.Do you want to go back home and return to the \"Donate Blood\" story?Without realizing, a month had elapsed... I knew that sooner or later we would have to return, but we kept postponing it. I was only worried about you and your mother. I had not even said goodbye and you were still suffering from your allergy problem when we left... I can imagine Judit was furious with me.I was planning to return soon to finish the editing... and to explain things to your mother. But Magdalena decided she'd wait for me on the island. She couldn't stand the thought of seeing Ernesto again.No.She was pissed, I suppose.I was the demon, Diego. And I am sorry. I suppose I behaved selfishly, but I am not sure I had a choice...The fact is she never did, and we've never spoken of it. Neither one of us has broached the topic.Me? Curiosity was killing me! For two days I called both your mother and Luis non-stop, the editor , but neither of them answered! So I decided to return to Madrid the next day so that I could witness what was happening for myself!Mateo is dead, Judit.We're here, Judit!Let's go, Dieguito. Give me your hand.No. We must obey your mother... You've had enough wind for one day...Play \"Elevator to the Gallows\" and take a look at the ending...Yes. Since I know them by heart, I can visualize the action.Yes. But you'd have to describe the action. Your mother used to describe some to me, some time ago.I would like to \"watch\" one by Tarantino or Scorsese, and also some Asian cinema...That's \"Girls and Suitcases\"!Turn up the volume!They're terrible!How could I have thought these takes were the good ones! What was I thinking!May I come in?Luis, the editor, sent it to me six years ago. At that time I didn't even bother to open it, I didn't want to know anything about him. I am now thinkingCall him, please!It doesn't matter.Oh, I'm sorry.Could I speak to Luis, please?Oh, I am so sorry... I had no idea!Mateo Blanco. Luis edited all my films...The one I know is Nieves, the first one.I am sorry to hear about Luis' death. I would have liked to speak to him...You have no idea how sorry I am!My editor. I just found out he died six years ago...Not long before he died he sent me this notebook. But I didn't want to know anything about him, I also didn't know he was dying... and I put it away... until today... His wife just told me he would have liked to speak to me, that was the purpose of sending me the notebook... but I didn't give him the chance.No. Never.No, no...

I want to be an actress. I've always wanted to.That's a cheap shot.In any case, don't worry. It didn't turn out well. I was too nervous.Come in!That's the film director. He says the reading was not sufficient and he wants to see me once more!Go see him, no?!Please, Ernesto. I need to do something! And I've always wanted to be an actress!They have not given me the role yet.Well, if I were to get it, we would still see each other every day, as it has been, in the mornings and evenings.

And could we get going?!No.Hello, Mateo?Not tonight.Something unexpected has happened, but don't worry, everything's OK.I won't be able to. I will see you directly at the studio. I have something to do.Yes. I'll see you tomorrow.Take me to the studio.If you don't take me, I'll go there myself, even if I have to drag myself.It's up to you.I will stay, under the condition that you let Mateo finish the shooting, according to what he decides.I will tell him I tripped.I don't know. Whatever Mateo decides, but I want to rest assured that you will respect his decision, no matter the cost nor the time that it will take. Is that clear?... And that's it.Ernesto is prepared to support whatever you decide.Three weeks.Be careful, he may walk in.Mateo, we must finish the shooting as soon as possible! Until then, I cannot leave Ernesto.I cannot leave, I've made a deal with him.You have not asked me...Mateo, please!What else? The only solution is that I continue to live with him until you finish the film.You don't have to think about that... What's important is that you finish shooting.I've told you, to live under the same roof, with him in his room and me in mine. He doesn't have the right to anything more.I am sorry...You have told me everything, in every way possible...We can't let him have his way! Every day I arrive worn out and every day I recover, right?I ask you only for a bit more patience... And a kiss!We have had a brutal fight... At the end, he ripped my clothes off and my shoes and he threw me out naked onto the highway. The jacket belongs to the cab driver. You must give him a good tip, if it weren't for him I don't know how I would have made it here...No, please...He will turn against you!No, not your house.Let's leave Madrid.Sorry to interrupt... I wanted to ask if there are any employment opportunities available here, with you... You always look so busy... I have a lot of free time...I have worked as a secretary at M. Capital, a very important finance company.No. It's not me.But they can't release the film so soon, right?What are we going to do?That the only intelligent thing we have done has been not to attend the premier, that my acting is pathetic, that you seem like a first-time director and that you lack talent. At the end, it wonders who might have made your first films. Never before has such a resounding downfall been witnessed... How horrible!What are you going to do?He was very generous with me and my family. My father was dying, I needed to take him to a private Hospital and Ernesto took care of everything... He paid for everything... And he made sure that my parents could return to their home town and that they lacked nothing...It's only natural that you would want to know.
