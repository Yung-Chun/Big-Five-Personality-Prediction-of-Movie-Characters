{"Ides-of-March-The": {"STEPHEN": {"raw_line": "I am neither Christian...nor atheist. I am not Jewish or Muslim. What I believe...my religion is called the constitution... A pause. Stephen snaps his fingers in the mic. We hear the distinct sound of feedback getting louder until it stops.I will defend till my dying breath your right to worship whatever god you believe in...If I'm not religious enough for you, don't vote for me. To the Director.You got it?If I'm not experienced enough don't vote for me. If I'm not...Thanks. We'll need these monitors turned up a bit...it's a big space and he wants to be able to hear.Also we'll need these podiums put on a riser as we agreed to in the pre-conditions. You're a few inches short and it makes it harder for the Governor to read his notes.Great, thanks. See you guys in a few hours.He doesn't but Pullman is 5'8\" he'll look like a hobbit behind that podium.A double.Home run. We hear the announcer thanking everyone for attending the debate. TOM DUFFY - campaign manager of the rival Pullman Campaign - is also watching from the wings. Duffy's smooth, calculated and icy. He walks over to Stephen and Paul.It's ours for the taking.At least. Maybe more.Yes Ida?Here it comes...hit me.Yes?Mmhmm.Three guesses.Correct.No need, we'll split Texas, it's a wash.That's your guess?I will neither confirm nor deny that statement.That I cannot do.You love me.You only love him because he gives you all the scoops.You're engaged.Ida I'm not naive about this stuff. I've worked on more campaigns than most people do by the time they're forty...I'm telling you this is the one.I have drunk it it's delicious. I don't care whether he leads in the polls...I don't care whether he has all the tools...Because the truth is, he's the only one that's going to make a difference in peoples lives...Even the people that hate him. If Mike Morris is President it says more about us than it does about him. I don't give a fuck if he can win. He has to win.I'll get it in a bit...Fucking kill me...where did we get this?Thank God it wasn't overseas. Just get rid of it -Are you fucking stoned...this is the same...the exact same piece the Republicans are gonna run against him in the general...we don't need to brag about it...Hi I'm Neville Chamberlain and I want to be your commander in chief.It's gonna come out but not paid for by us pal. Any truth on whether Pullman had investments in those diamond mines in Liberia?Doesn't matter I want to hear him denying it. If it's true, find out, if it's not, let them spend the next day telling the post that he doesn't own a diamond mine in Liberia...win win.We need to counter this Christian shit we're taking from last night...so get going...Where's our cut on the new thirty and a sixty second spots? We'll show it to him this afternoon in the staff meeting.Oh, right. Thanks. I've been waiting for this.Just some white paper I gotta pass out tonight.Negative shit. Our oppo guys do research - we feed it to the press, hope they bite.Read tomorrow's paper and you'll see.All of them.I wish it were something bigger actually. Just some transportation numbers. I'll have to spin this shit pretty heavy if we want it to stick.I guess.Just now.You a Bearcat...?A Cincinnati Bearcat?Oh that's right...but you changed something.You changed your hair.I must look like a total dumb ass right now.Come on it's not like that.You're right, I am big man on campus.I heard that.Maybe I will...when's a good night?Really? Tuesday?Quiet's good.I do?Oh...right...Yup...Mary.Paul knows...Paul agrees...Print it out.Governor...if you want to change...or lets call it refresh...National service isn't polling like the rest of your domestic policy.Good cop, good cop.All of that is exactly right...Governor if you're going to do it...then do it. Don't make it voluntary...mandatory.Mandatory!...everyone who graduates high school or turns eighteen, gives two years to his or her country. Military...peace corps...plant fucking trees, I don't care...and for that...their college education is paid for...period.No sir you don't...do it all...all the way. Mandatory.And here's the beauty of it...everyone who is older than eighteen and past the age of eligibility, would be for it...create national pride...give all the kids an education.Can't vote. Too young. This sits with them. Some start to smile.You can't lose.Remember, Governor... you have a six o'clock with Charlie Rose...It's long form... he's flying in...No, he won't be back... Ben and I are taking you......Don't tell me anyone's died...Who is this?What do you want?What for?If it's important shouldn't you be calling Paul?I can't be talking to you...I can't Tom.Paul, listen, call me as soon as you can...it's important.You're working for the wrong man.Yeah?No...I don't think I can.You gotta be kidding me.I am not.Eight.You think they like your guy?...pro choice...tax and spend liberal?I know for a fact that Thompson is going with us.I can't do it.I've played dirty but I don't have to play dirty anymore...you know why? Cause I got Morris!This is the sort of shit the Republicans pull.Paul's a friend.Paul.Not that I know of. What's going on with Thompson?It's nothing...never mind.Yeah okay...I'll look for quaaludes.Just get online and see if there's any chatter on the blogs...I don't know... just see what they're talking about.I'm married to the campaign, Governor.Really? When did they do that? Governor... Wall Street Journal numbers are in... and Pullman's down a point.Make sure Charlie Rose has these latest numbers before he goes on...And get a copy of the show before we leave...Where'd you go after Iowa?I had to go to New York.Yeah. So why politics?It just seems like an odd fit.He's a good guy.He's not my boss. He's the head of the DNC.I work for Paul, Paul works for Morris and if Morris wins, he's going to be your dad's boss.Don't tell your dad a lot of things.What time do you start tomorrow?I do see...How old do you think I am?You think I'm thirty?Thirty...how old are you?Twenty one?That's young.See laws are different in different states. Here in your hotel, in Kentucky...it's frowned upon...but we'll go across the bridge into Ohio...Yeah surprisingly they're very lax about their child endangerment laws...I took a cab.What time does Paul land?... Christ...who do we talk to about polling?...no...I just...I just need to get some internal polling on the fucking Independents and the right-wing nuts.Listen, put me on the line with...what's the guy's name at the Wall Street Journal?... yeah...Wait.Right...Adler...get me on the line with him.Molly listen, just give me a second...I want to talk to you about something.What? No nobody...just the cleaning lady...listen Ben...keep trying till you get him. We're gonna go with the position that we've always said, the race is closer than the polling...right...no don't...don't say that...just get him on the line and call me...I'll handle it...yup. He hangs up.Sorry about that.What?You're not mad about that are you?Your dad is an asshole.Do that.Yeah, I just wanted...I just wanted to be clear about everything...so there's no confusion...Well yeah, I'd appreciate it if we kept this...I mean, you know how people are.It's not like I got drunk and this happened...I mean...I wanted to...I really like you...you're smart...but I just...I don't want there to be any expectations...I just don't want you to think I'm some kind of player.No I'm not. I was being polite. MOLLY starts to tie STEPHENS tie.No I wasn't.I was?I thought I was being all smooth and subtle.You were pretty forward ...inviting me to the bar.Wow.No, not at all...I mean I kind of respect it in a weird sort of way.You have absolutely no idea how to tie a tie do you...You're very mature.When are you coming back?What happened with Thompson?I'm running some numbers now...I don't know...Yeah I'm on it...I gotta go.Yup... Just trying to figure out our stops on the ground.We'll be fine...we have to do it...and it's the right thing. Nothing bad happens when it's the right thing.Well there are exceptions to every rule... They smile. The Governor looks at Stephen.Fine now.Great...I think we're solid.Governor there's a big difference between Paul and me. Paul only believes in winning so he'll do or say anything to win.I'll do or say anything if I believe in it...but I have to believe in the cause.Well I won't be out of this line of work as long as you're in it.Pimping out ex presidents...Yeah. CUT TO:I didn't think it was true.But I should have told you this yesterday...sorry...I met with Tom Duffy yesterday.You were on a plane and he called me and he asked if we could meet...And I said why...he said it was very important so I did...but I should've fucking told you...Yes.-the gist of it is he wants to hire me. He wants me to jump ship and come work for him...this is bad Paul. He showed me poll numbers with Pullman ahead by four. We're in really deep fucking trouble he laid out their whole plan. Robo- calls, traffic jams, fake lit, and fucking Thompson. They promised him Secretary of State.Paul I'm sorry. Believe me...I just didn't think it was true.Please believe me that I honestly believed you were gonna come back and you were gonna tell me that we have Thompson in the bag and I didn't see the point. But it doesn't make it right and I'm sorry.Who do you want...A fund-raiser in Cleveland tonight.Will he go for it?We might pick up a couple of points...but we're...I don't know, we lose by three or four percent.Cabinet post.State... This sits with them.Do we have any other senators that can go to bat for us? House members won't do.Right...but we need a Senator...one from Ohio would be nice. We push the camera through the room, edging closer to PAUL.Fuck...Jess, I'll call you back... All of them? Goddamit!They're not gonna tell a pollster that they're gonna vote Democratic...I don't even know how to read these polls.We don't need the fucking vans...we just don't want Pullman to have them...Let me know how it's going out there.I'm on it.What time is this on tonight?How'd he do?It's not you. They laugh. CUT TO:Hello...Your phone rang.Who's calling at 2:30 in the morning?He asked for you by name.I thought it was mine. Who was it?One of the other interns drunk dialing you?Hold on...I'm gonna call him back....And I'm gonna tell him that I'm your dad...And I'm gonna tell him I'm coming over there with a shotgun...Why is the Governor calling you at 2:30 in the morning?Why is the Governor calling you at all?With the Governor? What's going on?There was a party with you...and Ben...and the Governor.Where was he?After the party?Jesus fucking Christ...Were you drunk?How many times?Does anybody know? Did anyone see you?How could you know?Then why is he calling you now?Why?For what?Ben... come here a minuteWhat's our limit on petty cash?I need as much as we have.Yeah...don't put it on the books. That's all.Don't put it down as anything...Just do it!Molly... She gets up and comes into his office. Stephen hands Molly a folder that he writes on the inside ofHere...I'll take that. That's all.No I can't tell you what happened in North Carolina.Okay what?Who told you that?Who?Where are you?Did Duffy tell you this?You're supposed to be my friend Ida. You'd stab me in the back like this? You'd ruin my reputation just so you-I've given you everything -every fucking scoop, your profile with Pau1....Go fuck yourself.Will you keep your voice down. Do you have any idea what a story like this could do to me?I could get fired.You mother fucker.You leaked it.Don't bullshit me Tom.I just spoke with Ida Horowicz.She's threatening to release the story.That we met! That I fuckin met with you!Don't play dumb here Tom.Who else?Well I know I didn't, so that leaves you.She knows whatever you told her.Well too late.She knows where we met, she knows when we met... she knows you had buffalo fucking wings.Yes she has a source.Yeah, you.Did you tell anyone?No.No.She's gonna take the story to Drudge, or Roll Call...shit like that.She's trying to blackmail me - wants info about Thompson.I can't do that.I'm not gonna be blackmailed Tom.If I tell her about Thompson I gotta tell her he's gonna endorse you guys.No fucking way. Paul told her we had Thompson in the bag. It'll make us look like fools.I can't do it.I Gotta go.I'm up here.Take this.It's almost 1800 bucks... you make the appointment now... today... from a pay phone... I'll take you to the clinic and pick you up... no one else... you understand?You take the rest of the money and you buy a ticket home... you can't be here anymore... we can't afford it... not with everything that's gonna happen in the next week. This situation just can't be here.Right.I would hope not.You fucked up, Molly...But I have a responsibility to him... and more importantly I have a responsibility to this campaign.Molly you've go to wake the fuck up... this is the big leagues... it's mean...and when you make mistakes you lose your right to play. Make the appointment and tell me when and where we have to go. He exits.So just call me when you can leave okay.I'll be back, this'll all be over...How'd he take it?Paul-I gotta tell you something.Ida knows I met with Duffy. PAUL stares at him blankly.I don't know how she found out. Tried to blackmail me. Said she was gonna let the story out if I didn't tell her what happened at your meeting with Thompson.Probably. Yeah. Whoever she takes it to, they're gonna call me for a statement.I could just deny the whole thing, but if they call Duffy and he admits to it, that could look worse. If I say no comment they won't let up.I don't understand.Paul...they're gonna print that story in the paper tomorrow morning.But why? Why would you do that to me? Why would you do that to the campaign.Then why would you do that to me?What?I made a mistake - a stupid mistake.I didn't think it was important.Well it really isn't whether you trust me, it's whether the Governor does.He does.Where's Duffy...I'm in. I'm coming to work for you.I know who leaked it.Paul.Yeah. I told him we met. He leaked it.I felt like I should.Obviously.I quit.I quit! And I can give you everything on Morris. Everything.I can lay out his whole strategy for you.What if I had something else?Yeah.I'm not unstable.What if I had something big?Something big. Something that'll bring Morris down.Give me the job.Politics is my life.Like you?You knew I was gonna tell Paul.You knew if I told him he'd fire me.Yeah I got a nice speech on that. You were never gonna hire me.This is my life you're talking about.Does it seem that way?What's say I do the talking and you do the listening.As of tomorrow morning there's going to be some changes in your campaign. Paul is out. I will be your senior campaign manager. I'll draft a statement, \"we're at a point in the campaign where some changes have to be made etc.\" You can put your own words in there, you do it better than most.Because you want to win. Because you broke the only rule in politics. You want to be President, you can start a war, you can lie, you can cheat, you can bankrupt the country, but you can't fuck the interns...they'll get you for that.A troubled young pregnant girl......Who needed cash for an abortion.Is that your best play?So how did I get here? You're right Mike, there's nothing. No phone messages, no text, no e- mails, no photos or tapes, and yet I'm standing right here.She left a note. The Governor stands in silence.I cleaned up your mess. I took her phone and I found her note. They stare at each other in silence.You tell me, you were the last one she called. Note says she was pregnant, said you were going to pay for her abortion...it also said she didn't want to hurt you.Because she's twenty.Paul's gone today. I set a meeting with you and Thompson where you promise him the ticket. You get three hundred and fifty-six pledged delegates, you get North Carolina, and then you take office and make right what so many have made wrong. All the things we both believe in.Four years, let's not get ahead of ourselves. A long beat.Housekeeping, before you ended up on page one.I was fixing a situation...I got a call, someone from the hotel thought I could help and called me.I loaned her some money and gave her a ride.Okay, there's no note.You think I brought it here? That's how people get hurt.It's your call Governor. As the Governor weighs his options we-I'll keep that in mind. Are you here to talk to me?I'm sorry.He's meeting with Thompson.I learned from the best.How do you know I didn't have something on you? They both smile.Farragut North? Paul nods his head.Sounds relaxing.How so?You can't believe everything you read.No press beyond this point...she's press. I'll read about it in the funny papers.You're my best friend Ida.Yeah I can hear them.", "clean_line": "christian atheist jewish muslim believe religion called constitution pause stephen snaps fingers

MORRIS": {"raw_line": "How would that matter?Then let me try and clarify...I was raised Catholic, I am not a practicing Catholic...I have no idea what happens when you die and if the Senator does, then perhaps he should be President. I'll even vote for him.Let me be more specific. I am neither a Christian, nor an atheist, I'm not Jewish or Muslim...what I believe...my religion is written on a piece of parchment called the Constitution. Meaning I will defend, till my dying breath, your right to worship, in whatever God or lack thereof you believe in, as long as it doesn't hurt others. I believe we should be judged as a government by how we take care of those who can't take care of themselves. That's my religion. If you feel that I'm not religious enough, then don't vote for me. If you feel I'm not experienced enough or tall enough then don't vote for me. Because I'm not going to change those to get elected.Is this a Democratic primary or a general election?Ben, where's my op ed on national service? It's better for me to work off of that.Get me a hard copy...I hate these fucking things...Just give me a second...I don't give a shit about polling...I'm not going to play this game with you Stephen...and if this is your good cop bad cop act with Paul...I'm not changing it.Hang on.Yeah I said it all here, \"It's going to help people get an education...it's going to create national unity...it's going to teach young people a trade...and it's going to help get people out of debt from college loans. Tell me where that fails.That'll poll well.We do all of that now, with this...Paul likes this?...you guys are my brain trust.And all the others?Okay, you and Ben work it into the stump speech - get me a hard copy and I'll write it in my own words.Why am I doing him?Is Paul going?Stephen... you're still single, right?Good answer. He's married to the campaign...Now we're moving in the right direction. Ben, are you still single?Crack team.Is it a difficult decision? I would have to believe that it is... would I do it? No... but I can't see myself... or anyone... certainly not a government, telling a woman what she can do with her body.... I would consider it arrogant to judge someone until I've walked in their shoes.Yes. Because of what it says about us as a society.And she was murdered, what would I do.Sure...well if I could get to him I'd find a way to kill him.No, I would commit a crime for which I would happily go to jail.Because society has to be better than the individual. If I were to do that I would be wrong.Isn't it time for a commercial. They laugh.That's unfortunate.You okay?I think the weather might determine that. If we get there.Is this your personal theory...cause I can shoot holes in it...Roberto Clemente...on a humanitarian flight.So how we doin?No I mean...the campaign how we doin?Listen Stephen...you're not Paul. I pay him to use the word \"great\". I pay you to tell me the truth.Okay Paul.But you wouldn't.You'll make a lousy consultant when you're out of this line of work.So at best you've got eight years...then you'll end up with a nice little consultant firm on Farragut North...eating at the Palm...pulling in seven hundred and fifty grand a year...pimping out Senators to Saudi Princes. They both smile.Then I better win...Now, I've been married for eleven years, to the smartest person I know...and we have a normal marriage...which means when we disagree...she wins. What we don't ever disagree on is how we're going to leave this planet for our daughter. Are we gonna leave it better off, or worse? The richest people in this country don't pay their fare share. And when they're asked to, they cry socialism, they use phrases like redistribution of wealth. That scares everybody and they all run and they hide. For the record, my campaign is vehemently against the distribution of wealth to the richest Americans, by our government! And I will run on that!You know how you fight the war on terror?...Don't need their product anymore. Their product is oil, just don't need it and they go away. We don't have to bomb anyone we don't have to invade anyone! CUT TO:If I'm your president, the first thing I put in motion, ten years from the day I'm in office...no new car in America runs on an internal combustion engine. It'll create hundreds of thousands of new jobs...we will start the next technological revolution and we will lead the world again...like we used to...How real are the numbers?What do you think?I can't run from Ohio...they'll kill us.I'm not gonna do it. What's he want head of the FDA or something ridiculous?Labor?Are you fucking kidding me...I'm gonna give Secretary of State to a guy who wants to cut the top ten floors off the UN? Paul when we started this campaign I said I wasn't gonna make those kind of deals.Paul, I respect you...respect your opinion...but I'm never gonna do it...so I suggest we find a way for me to win Ohio.Anything else?The greatest speech ever given on hydrogen power.Don't I know it.Who's Mitchell?Fucking Congressmen. Could you imagine doing this every two years?In four more years.Deal.I don't know.Is Paul working on you?They are good.He's a shit.Yes Stephen.Every time I draw a line in the sand...and I keep moving it. Fund raising, union deals...I wasn't going to do any of it...negative ads...I can't on this one. Not Thompson. Beat.Tell Mrs. Mitchell I'll make her goddamn luncheon.Let the old ladies pat me on the head.You too baby. They lay their heads back onto the headrests.It's a silly argument. STUDENT 1 Not to fifty percent of Americans.Over the age of fifty.Well that's changing...and hopefully the way we frame the argument is...From a religious to a civil rights issue.Not really. They used to ban interracial marriage...women couldn't vote...the list goes on... STUDENT 1 The argument of course-Now wait she has a point to make....How so?Now. STUDENT 1 Yes now.So that's what I'm saying. CUT TO:See we're framing the argument based on the idea that homosexuality is a choice, you choose to be gay, not that you were born that way like being born black. Because if you start the discussion with the idea that gay is not a life choice but part of your DNA, then gay marriage is and can only be a civil rights issue.We'll see. It'll drive them to the polls one way or the other.The entire staff is in a state of shock. We have sent our condolences to Jack and JoAnna Stearns and their whole family...and of course our hearts go out to them... it's hard to imagine what they're going through... All we know at this point is it appears to be a drug...an accidental prescription overdose. Ida?We have no reason to believe...I don't think we have any of that information yet. Obviously there will be a full investigation. Just wanted to say that our hearts go out...our prayers go out to the entire family...and she was part of our family.Not well. But I did know her, and what I saw was a hard working, young woman, with a great and positive spirit. It's a very sad day in our campaign and a very sad day for the people close to Jack. REPORTER 6 How long has she interned with you Governor? The Governor looks back at Paul. Paul steps up to the mic.It seems you have something you want to talk about.If you have something...or think you have something you want to get off your chest...Okay.And why would I do that? Beat.What do you think you have Stephen? A troubled young girl tells you a story.Is that what she told you?What did you do, give her money? Maybe she just wanted cash and you were the perfect guy to hit up.You need a job that bad Stephen? You walk in here with your dick in your hand...you've got nothing.Well go home.How would you know that?I thought it was an accident. THEN:Then why would she leave a note that could only do that?What do you want?Well I don't believe in extortion...I don't believe in tying myself to you for the next eight years.What were you doing in her room?No. You were already fired, you were out. What were you doing in her room?You were off the campaign, but you thought it was important to come back and fix things? It was your voice on the phone the other night.You were fucking her. What did you do Stephen?I bet you did.There's no note.Show it to me.Okay let's play this out. You're not wearing a wire because everything you've suggested is illegal...and you wouldn't fare well in federal prison. You were fucking her and she told you about her situation. There are no records or conversations between us. And since she's had an abortion, no DNA evidence. So if there's no note, then it's your word against mine. Your word. A fired, disgruntled, employee, or a sitting governor...There's no note.Paul you got a minute?Thank you Senator Thompson! Well the polls aren't quite closed, but I want to congratulate Senator Pullman...And his Republican constituents on their win here in Ohio. The room explodes in laughter and applause.Senator Thompson I am honored to stand here today with you. I am humbled by your kind words, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, today marks the beginning of a fight between two sets of ideals. Either we're going to move forward or were going to live in the past... Either we're going to lead the world in technology, or we are going to bury our heads in the sand... the sands of Saudi Arabia...the sands of Iraq! Either we're going to let greed and corruption ruin our industries and our shorelines or we are going to take back our country! We are not a nation used to coming in second or third...Senator Thompson I am proud that you have brought integrity back to this election. Because that's what this comes down to, integrity. Who we are. Because how we project ourselves to the rest of the world matters!...Dignity matters!...Integrity matters!...Our future depends on it!
