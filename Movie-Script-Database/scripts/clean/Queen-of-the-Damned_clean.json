{"Queen-of-the-Damned": {"LESTAT": {"raw_line": "Whether it was that first meal, the music, or the 100 years of rest, I'm not sure, but suddenly I was feeling better than ever. My appetite for living was voracious. My hearing so exact I could locate precisely the source of the music...My old house.It was hard to believe these beings were mortal -- so confident in their skin. Everything in my body wanted to be with them. I couldn't help myself.Please don't stop.The door, of course.Your music woke me from the longest sleep. It's sublime. In two hundred years I've never heard anything quite like it.The question provoked an irresistible urge...You may call me the vampire Lestat.It just rolled out of my mouth. With one simple sentence I had betrayed everything about my kind. Betrayed our code of secrecy.Your struggles are over.All that you've ever dreamed of will be yours.Your lucky day.It was a bold move, I admit. But from that moment on, they were my friends, my children, my band. Together we rode on the wave of my preternatural ambition to superstardom, giving the world a new god... me.Good evening. I'm so sorry I'm late. I was just having my... breakfast.Yes. But why hide it in this day and age? I've hidden in the shadows for centuries. It's time to share myself with the world.Our label isn't complaining, no.If you like, I'll give you a private demonstration in your hotel room tonight.After calling one stone tomb home sweet home for so long, I like to experience as much diversity as I can. Wouldn't you?Maybe I'm trying to resurrect a few old friends with my words. Daring them to come out.The casket...I don't like repeating myself.I imagine they are, yes.Yes, as a matter of fact, I do...Come out, come out, wherever you are.See you all in Death Valley.Come out, come out, whoever you are.You. In...You. No.Yes, I'd say I'm down with that.Oh, the sweet song of her blood.I'll hear it in my head all night.Roger...I didn't know you were religious.Roger...Be careful, Roger. Very careful.It was the winter of 1788 and I was brought to a Mediterranean Island by the man who made me...... if a man is what you'd call him.Who are you? Do I know you?I'm the lord of a great manor. They'll send an army of men to look for me.I'll kill you!Chose me? For what?I'm dying.More!I impressed my maker with my thirst for things. He set out to educate me in the unknown. Taught me all about the world, its hidden history... and about myself.Humanity? We're murderers.My senses run amok, like a newborn child. And as for my new powers, I was beside myself with the pleasure of it all...But why must we hide, Marius? We are the powerful, we are the immortal. We should walk fearless in the open!So I could never know her?So I can never be known?My God...My God, what have you done to me?She's just a child... forgive me.The faces of my victims haunted me, rising behind my eyes, reminding me of my fate... I played for days trying to expel the last bit of my human feelings... and face the cold, dark wasteland of eternity...Perhaps... So you know Marius...Not how to stay alive apparently.Well, I can fix that.Is it? And what else do you think you know?Am I? Tell me all about it.Is that so? What I do is art, is it?Something beautiful...Well, I'm not hiding now, am I?Ah. Poor, poor me...Well, Talamascan, you're certainly a very clever librarian, aren't you?How sad, you people always trying to know the unknowable... So, was it a good read? My diary.Talamasca's been following me for years. I've never known one to be so brave. Or is it just foolish?Go. I'm through with you. Your kind never satisfies my thirst.You better just stick to your books, Talamascan. 'Cause you have it all wrong. I love all this. I delight in it. The dark, dreary world I went to sleep in has burnt itself out and been replaced by the 20th Century -- can you imagine my joy at waking up to discover such a world? It has outdistanced my wildest dreams of it. I scream of good and evil, and mortals stand and cheer. I adore being back in action... every moment, every single drop of it! Now consider yourself exceedingly lucky and go!What?Clever, clever librarian.No, Roger, you wouldn't have.Yes. For the moment.Well... I wouldn't unpack if I were you.Ah. Yes.No, thank you, Roger. I'll make sure they're taken care of.I don't think we've met.Of course you do.I'm always hungry.Vampires don't eat... food.Mine eyes dazzle, she died so young.It's a very old poem of mine.Don't do that.I'm very ticklish.I don't know. Let's see.Yes, Marius was impressed with my thirst for knowledge... But itMarius!They're... alive.Would you like me to play for you?More!Let me go!God, her blood is like liquid fire. Who are they?Release me!Marius, please, just one more time. I felt the sun. The light, Marius, the light!You'll not stop me...Until tonight. And she chose me! Me! Never you! You'll not stop me!I must have more!Marius!Marius! Please!Many times since, I have called to Marius. I howled into the night in loneliness and pain.But there was no answer -- just the endless procession of days, months, years... My teacher left me to my darkest lesson -- that in the end, we are alone.I hate bedtime.Marius...!And you. Still wearing the old fashions, I see.How did you manage to slip through the 1950s in red velvet?Don't think you missed much.Elvis, yes.I'd say a few pounds lighter. Though, if you ever catch me wearing a white jumpsuit, you have my permission to slice off my head.Live and let live.How did you find me?Come, let me show you what it means to live in the light.Out there. My fans. Thousands and thousands. They worship me. Millions of arms reach out to embrace, beg me to come into their lives.With all my black little heart.I only have myself.What's that supposed to mean?Good! I'm glad she's risen! Let her come.200 years and the same broken record.Well then, it's every vampire for himself. Just the kind of rules I like. The rules you taught me.Do you remember your first words to me, Marius? 'I am unknowable.' I'd rather not exist at all than have to live eternally as a ghost.Such reverence for mortals! Then you should have left me as one!Said the vampire to his son.Ah. Yes.No, thank you, Roger. We'll entertain ourselves.Perhaps you would like a tour of the place... first.Roger... would you be so kind?Roger. Not that one. Leave her to me...You must be very keen to die.The Talamascans have become quite stealthy. I didn't know infiltration was quite their style.How did you find me?Clever librarian... You should know, based on all your research, that groupies don't ever find their way out of here again.Then why are you following me? What do you want?Last wishes. What's yours?I don't have time for this.Maybe not.You don't know what you're asking! I don't know what's in that librarian's head of yours, but it's not what you think.I'll know when I kill you.Are we? I seek the light. You seek the shadows.Alright!This may be painful for a mortal. You're still attached to your skin.Close your eyes. Don't breathe.And now for my next trick.Yes. For just a moment. But as the pain is more intense for us, so is ecstacy. You see, we love our victims.No, although the taste is so rich and sweet. Love is the essence of the dark gift. The connection is so much more satisfying, brief as it is, than anything else.As you drink, you feel the heart weakening... it struggles even though there's no hope. You feel the life slipping away, the flash of those brief years. The taste of mortality you can no longer experience... and it is beautiful... No 'relationship,' no commingling can ever reach the heights of that experience.Your blood...Yes...You want to know everything. You want to see what it's like. Then come! I'll show you.Come closer, Jesse. You want to see? You want to know?You see now? Are you ready? Now do you want it?!No. Of course you don't.Well I didn't grant your final wish. It was an impossible wish to begin with. You see, I am unknowable.Good-bye, Talamascan.Jesse.Come on, children.I'm so glad I decided to rise... After tonight, Death Valley will live up to its name!You want more?!This one's for those who've come for me!Get out of here!Akasha...My wishes...?Had a King?You?Never.Can we try that again?Show me the world...Where are we?You live here?So warm... ... their blood...... they're mortal...Why?This is the reason you have risen?Made me see.Never. She is my Queen.Yes...She's nothing to me.But, My Queen, you've forgotten my reward!I left you one drop, my love. Drink deep and live.Drink, my love.I will never leave you again.Charmed, I'm sure.Unexpected?Always.Shall we go get a drink, love?", "clean_line": "meal music years rest sure suddenly feeling better appetite living voracious hearing exact locate precisely source music old house hard believe beings mortal confident skin body wanted couldn help stop door course music woke longest sleep sublime years ve heard like question provoked irresistible urge vampire lestat rolled mouth simple sentence betrayed kind betrayed code secrecy struggles ve dreamed lucky day bold admit moment friends children band rode wave preternatural ambition superstardom giving world new god good evening sorry late having breakfast yes hide day age ve hidden shadows centuries time share world label isn complaining like ll private demonstration hotel room tonight calling stone tomb home sweet home long like experience diversity wouldn maybe trying resurrect old friends words daring come casket like repeating imagine yes yes matter fact come come death valley come come yes oh sweet song blood ll hear head night roger know religious roger careful roger careful winter brought mediterranean island man man know lord great manor ll send army men look ll kill chose dying impressed maker thirst things set educate unknown taught world hidden history humanity murderers senses run amok like newborn child new powers pleasure hide marius powerful immortal walk fearless open know known god god child forgive faces victims haunted rising eyes reminding fate played days trying expel bit human feelings face cold dark wasteland eternity know marius stay alive apparently fix think know tell art beautiful hiding ah poor poor talamascan certainly clever librarian aren sad people trying know unknowable good read diary talamasca following years ve known brave foolish kind satisfies thirst better stick books talamascan cause wrong love delight dark dreary world went sleep burnt replaced th century imagine joy waking discover world outdistanced wildest dreams scream good evil mortals stand cheer adore action moment single drop consider exceedingly lucky clever clever librarian roger wouldn yes moment wouldn unpack ah yes thank roger ll sure taken care think ve met course hungry vampires eat food eyes dazzle died young old poem ticklish know let yes marius impressed thirst knowledge itmarius alive like play let god blood like liquid release marius time felt sun light marius light ll stop tonight chose ll stop marius marius times called marius howled night loneliness pain answer endless procession days months years teacher left darkest lesson end hate bedtime marius wearing old fashions manage slip red velvet think missed elvis yes pounds lighter catch wearing white jumpsuit permission slice head live let live come let means live light fans thousands thousands worship millions arms reach embrace beg come lives black little heart supposed mean good glad risen let come years broken record vampire kind rules like rules taught remember words marius unknowable exist live eternally ghost reverence mortals left said vampire son ah yes thank roger ll entertain like tour place roger kind roger leave keen die talamascans stealthy know infiltration style clever librarian know based research groupies way following want wishes time maybe know asking know librarian head think ll know kill seek light seek shadows alright painful mortal attached skin close eyes breathe trick yes moment pain intense ecstacy love victims taste rich sweet love essence dark gift connection satisfying brief drink feel heart weakening struggles hope feel life slipping away flash brief years taste mortality longer experience beautiful relationship commingling reach heights experience blood yes want know want like come ll come closer jesse want want know ready want course grant final wish impossible wish begin unknowable good bye talamascan jesse come children glad decided rise tonight death valley live want ve come akasha wishes king try world live warm blood mortal reason risen queen yes queen ve forgotten reward left drop love drink deep live drink love leave charmed sure unexpected shall drink love"}, "JESSE": {"raw_line": "No!I have reason to believe Lestat's the real thing. A vampire. And an ancient one.It would appear that way. But have you listened to his songs? Read his lyrics?Well,i have. In one of his songs he refers to a pub called the Sailor's Arms. I think it's a clue...'Where are you now? Back in the sailor's arms, somewhere in the back streets of Soho?' I tracked down the old leases in London. It turns out, in the late 1700's, there was a pub right in the backstreets of Soho called the Sailor's Arms.And it had a reputation for dealing with black magic. Witches' covens, seances, that sort of thing.And most importantly, reports of people being lured there and subsequently attacked by bloodsucking fiends.Here's where you could find the Sailor's Arms in old London.And here is where it would be today. Of course the Sailor's Arms is not there anymore. That part of London is mostly old warehouses, meat-packing plants.Yes, but right now there's only one place to get a drink -- of sorts. A private club -- in exactly the same place. The Waverly Arms.Well, what happens at the Waverly Arms now makes the Sailor's Arms look like a Happy Meal at McDonald's.It's a vampire coven. And Lestat's leading us to it.Well... it was taken... while... ... in motion.But listen, if you look closely, you can see they're vampires. I'm sure of it. And Lestat's leading us to them and --But... uh...I did.Yes. Last night.No one. I... just... went. Look, I know it was breaking protocol and I'm really sorry, it's just I think --Hey, does it look like I got involved? That is not called involvement. That is called running.Vampires. Gathering. I'm sure of it.You have to listen to Lestat's lyrics. They're amazing.Many of the references could only be derived from years of research in the Bibliotech de Paris, which seems unlikely for a young rock star in his early twenties. Plus there are historical details dating back hundreds of years Lestat describes that don't exist anywhere... except in our library. He refers to Marius, the great white lord, who ruled over a group of islands off the Bay of Naples in the late 18th Century. What I'm trying to say here, and maybe I'm not doing the best job of it, is that Lestat may be the oldest and most powerful vampire ever documented!Right. That's the best part. Lestat's not afraid to piss them off. He wants mortals and immortals to know he's there, to know he exists. I don't know why... But this has never happened before. Don't you see? He's a one man revolution.Fine. Well then, I guess I'll just have to go back and get better, more conclusive evidence! Maybe you just can't unravel all the mysteries of the world out there, by sitting around all day in a dusty old library in here!Yeah, I'm great. I just found a vampire.Cause I think I'm on to something pretty big. The most important sighting Talamasca's had in years... Jesus, I don't know, David... I thought I was onto something... Maybe I didn't see anything...Talbot. C'mon. You know me. I'm not freaking out on you. I'm just onto what looks -- alright lookedDavid. There's nothing else. Nothing is 'beguiling' me, alright? Nothing. C'mon.I'd be even luckier if that damn picture came out... Wait a second. So you do believe me? You do think it's a vampire coven.They're all nightscapes. The detail is amazing. Mid-1500s. Florence.This man is in both.Have you --Marius?! From Lestat's lyrics. I knew I was right.What do you mean the original vampire?David, you've been tracking Marius your whole life. Maybe he's out there waiting for you right now. Don't you ever want to just go and find him and --You do?Thanks. What is it?Thank you for this.Je suis le vampire Lestat... I am the vampire Lestat.Sure, all the time.You haven't seen the rest of my body.My host... oh he's here somewhere.Marius...Marius has the blood of the ancients flowing in his veins.That's a myth. Marius is around here somewhere...You... you really should meet him.Because... because... he's wise, a philosopher... he asks the big questions. Like how are you going to get through eternity? It's easier for us mortals. Life is brief, but for you...I mean... what can you really do with immortality besides just slip from one day to the next, trapped in a void of meaninglessness, relieved only by your next victim? How do you not give in to despair and just wither away from boredom, hopelessness?You know, it's like they say -- the more things change, the more they stay the same. For you that's forever, right?You saved me.I know a lot of things.Well I guess we've got that in common. Although I think I'm a little ahead in the race here.'Mine eyes dazzle, she died so young.' It's about the girl with the violin, isn't it?I... I think you're a lot like Marius, Lestat.You're... you're both artists. He's a painter. You're a singer...Yes... From nothing... you try to create... something beautiful... ... out of the... the cold, dark wasteland of eternity...But... but Marius isn't a rebel. You're different in that way. You don't want to hide, follow the laws, concealed in the shadows like some insect. You... you still want to walk with the living, don't you, Lestat?No, but the only time you're not really alone is when you kill... But, Lestat, you can't help it... it's not your fault... He made you this way...I... I'm only an apprentice.Does anything, Lestat?I mean, what's the point of coming into the light if not to have someone really know you?You want the world to see you're real, don't you, Lestat? Don't you? Well, here I am!Lestat!There's something you left out of your diary.You kept her violin, didn't you?Hey, it's okay. I understand... After all, it's only human.Jesus Christ.You're right, David. The journal has everything in it.David, listen... I'm going to Los Angeles for the concert.David, I... I talked to him... Look I'm sorry. But I... I have to see what's out there with my own eyes. I'm onto something. I just don't know what yet... I have to find out...It's not emotion. It's instinct... I'll return when I have my findings. Good-bye.Lestat.Akasha!It's not. I... I came on my own.I've been tracking your manager for days... Then I figured out you simply have to look the part.I'm not a groupie...Are you granting wishes?Show me what it's like to be you. That's my last wish. Grant it, Lestat.All a vampire has is time.Right. The covens are coming for you. I understand why you're doing it. You have to be who you are, no matter what happens.But how are you spending what may be your last night on Earth, Lestat? As you always have... Alone.Don't kill me yet. Let's spend our last nights together. Share it with me. Show me what it's like to be you.That's right. You don't know what's in my head, Lestat. Do you want to?Gee, Lestat, that's a great way to get to know someone. Here. I'll give you a preview. Coming attractions. This is what you'll find.I have this recurring dream that I'm a child and I'm living in this big house filled with vampires. And every night when I go to sleep, I wish to God the same thing... you know what that is, Lestat?That I will have the dream again... Because in the dream I'm happy. And the dream is more real than my life... I don't know how, but I know you, Lestat... My life is a big mystery and you, you have the answer...I can't go on pretending this life of mine is real. I can't live a lie... I'm just like you Lestat. We're the same...No. We're looking for exactly the same thing. You know it... Please. Show me.I don't care.Do that again!Did it hurt?Love? I thought it was the blood.Do you like it?Do it to me... Please... With your blood I'll know you...I'll know everything...Is she alright?Lestat, no!Lestat! Wait!Aunt Maharet?You're a...?Oh my God, this is why... I knew I was different. I knew --Am I...?And something happened there.I thought I was like him.Lestat's all I can think about... I felt like I belonged with him. Now I know why...I missed you so much, Aunt Maharet.But this is my home. This is where I belong. Why do you want to get rid of me so quickly?Dear Aunt Maharet, my whole life, I've felt... kind of crazy I guess, different from everyone, and now I know why... You say I now know who I am meant to be... I have found my answers. You are right...I know you want me to be a regular human girl... but I'm not. I can't be...Lestat is my destiny... I know that now. I love you, Aunt Maharet. Good-bye.Yeah.Lestat! Lestat!Lestat! Lestat!And what about Lestat?I don't believe that.Lestat!What has she done to you?It's all right, Maharet.It's what I want. I am ready.I thought I'd lost you...Maharet...Is she... dead?Good question...David, this is Lestat.I told you I'd return with my findings. Here they are.Please don't be sad. I'm where I belong. I'm happy now.What's it like?Do you want to find out?Well, if you ever should change your mind... Oh. I have a present for you. From an old friend.And Marius sent a message. You were right. He doesn't go to the Dorchester. But he's gonna be at Claridge's later...Well, I guess this is good-bye.Good-bye, dear friend.", "clean_line": "reason believe lestat real thing vampire ancient appear way listened songs read lyrics songs refers pub called sailor arms think clue sailor arms streets soho tracked old leases london turns late pub right backstreets soho called sailor arms reputation dealing black magic witches covens seances sort thing importantly reports people lured subsequently attacked bloodsucking fiends sailor arms old london today course sailor arms anymore london old warehouses meat packing plants yes right place drink sorts private club exactly place waverly arms happens waverly arms makes sailor arms look like happy meal mcdonald vampire coven lestat leading taken motion listen look closely vampires sure lestat leading uh yes night went look know breaking protocol sorry think hey look like got involved called involvement called running vampires gathering sure listen lestat lyrics amazing references derived years research bibliotech paris unlikely young rock star early twenties plus historical details dating hundreds years lestat describes exist library refers marius great white lord ruled group islands bay naples late th century trying maybe best job lestat oldest powerful vampire documented right best lestat afraid piss wants mortals immortals know know exists know happened man revolution fine guess ll better conclusive evidence maybe unravel mysteries world sitting day dusty old library yeah great vampire cause think pretty big important sighting talamasca years jesus know david thought maybe talbot mon know freaking looks alright lookeddavid beguiling alright mon luckier damn picture came wait second believe think vampire coven nightscapes amazing mid florence man marius lestat lyrics knew right mean original vampire david ve tracking marius life maybe waiting right want thanks thank je suis le vampire lestat vampire lestat sure time haven seen rest body host oh marius marius blood ancients flowing veins myth marius meet wise philosopher asks big questions like going eternity easier mortals life brief mean immortality slip day trapped void meaninglessness relieved victim despair wither away boredom hopelessness know like things change stay forever right saved know lot things guess ve got common think little ahead race eyes dazzle died young girl violin isn think lot like marius lestat artists painter singer yes try create beautiful cold dark wasteland eternity marius isn rebel different way want hide follow laws concealed shadows like insect want walk living lestat time kill lestat help fault way apprentice lestat mean point coming light know want world real lestat lestat left diary kept violin hey okay understand human jesus christ right david journal david listen going los angeles concert david talked look sorry eyes know emotion instinct ll return findings good bye lestat akasha came ve tracking manager days figured simply look groupie granting wishes like wish grant lestat vampire time right covens coming understand matter happens spending night earth lestat kill let spend nights share like right know head lestat want gee lestat great way know ll preview coming attractions ll recurring dream child living big house filled vampires night sleep wish god thing know lestat dream dream happy dream real life know know lestat life big mystery answer pretending life real live lie like lestat looking exactly thing know care hurt love thought blood like blood ll know ll know alright lestat lestat wait aunt maharet oh god knew different knew happened thought like lestat think felt like belonged know missed aunt maharet home belong want rid quickly dear aunt maharet life ve felt kind crazy guess different know know meant answers right know want regular human girl lestat destiny know love aunt maharet good bye yeah lestat lestat lestat lestat lestat believe lestat right maharet want ready thought lost maharet dead good question david lestat told return findings sad belong happy like want change mind oh present old friend marius sent message right dorchester gonna claridge later guess good bye good bye dear friend"}}}
