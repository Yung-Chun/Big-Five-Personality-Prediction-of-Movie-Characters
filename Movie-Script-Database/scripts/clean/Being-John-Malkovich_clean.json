{"Being-John-Malkovich": {"LOTTE": {"raw_line": "Sorry, hon. I didn't know Orrin Hatch was out of his pen. Good morning.Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini. Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.The monkey.Is the trial date set?Why'd you do it, Craig?Why, Craig. why?You know, maybe you should speak to someone about this.Sorry, honey.Sorry!Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.Seven-ishThey'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?Thanks. Craig helped, too, by the way.Yes. All vegetable. all the time.New puppet?She's very beautiful.Hi.Did you eat?I was worried.Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.The iguana.I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.No thanks. I'm going to turn in.'kay.Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.I want to try.I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.Now?I'm scared.Holy cow!Oh, yes. Yes.I have to go back.I have to go back now.I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.I was, wasn't I? I was John fucking Malkovich! Take me back, Craig.Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?Yes, Hi.Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing. I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.What raw, animal power!Oh, I like this.My God! Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet her there...Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet her there...I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.Don't crowd me, Craig.Maxine!God, she's beautiful. The way she's looking at me. At him. At us.I've never been looked at like this by a woman.Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We\u0092ll smoke a joint. Tensions will melt away.Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it. Psychotherapy.I want a divorce.I'm getting divorced.But why, Son of Malkovich?What are you doing?Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.You've always hated the animals.I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.Us, of course.Fuck Maxine.I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.Maxine...This is too good to be true.Yes.We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.Me and John.Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.I'm sorry. That was nasty.Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions. I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.Dr. Lester, everything's falling apart.I blew it, Dr. Lester.But now we've lost access to Craig.I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?Suck my dick!You bastard.I have to see you.What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.Help! He's locking me in a cage!It'll never happen, fuckface.What's that?Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.You fell in love with her first.You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.I need a shower.You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.We have to meet.Oh, Elijah, you are magnificent!Maxine! Listen: It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.Hello, Dr. Lester?Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...No, I didn't know that.No.Does Floris know that she's the chosen?I have sinned, unwittingly, against the community. And for this I am truly sorry.Oh, it's glorious. It's indescribable.You bastard!It's Craig in there, I can tell.Why not? I need to get in there!That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.Well, I for one, am resigning. I will not serve evil. I am ashamed of all of you.I'll take my chances.Oh, my friends. Be thankful you're not human. People are treacherous and greedy and corrupt. I've lost my heart to two of them and I almost lost my soul to another. And I'm no better. Look at the way I keep you, locked in cages, for my own enjoyment. Well, I've been in a cage too, my friends. Literally and figuratively. So tonight I set you free.Good-bye, friends.Hello, friendThey've come to kill me, Elijah. See, I know too much. I should get the door. It's impolite to keep death waiting.They're going to take over the world, Elijah. Evil will reign. But, then, evil already reigns, doesn't it? So what difference does it make if John Malkovich is wearing the fucking crown while it's reigning?I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?What have I become?Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?Hush, sweetheart.I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.My God!I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.It's Elijah.The monkey.A better friend.It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.People make mistakes.I know.Sure. We could really use a farmer. We'd be grateful for the help. Also, I think, you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to lift our spirits. You know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly.Oh honey.

Okay.Gimmicky bastard.May 11th.I'm a puppeteer.I... puppeteer.Uh. yeah.Thank you.No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.Schwartz.Schwartz.My name is Schwartz.Forget it.Yes?I said \"yes.\"Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.Glooph is not a letter, sir.You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.No.No. I understand perfectly.Just one. Why is this floor so short?Moving story.Is that true?Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.Emily Dickinson.Shut up!Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?We have to make it an early night.Hmmm.Hmmm.No kidding, Peter.Thank you, Floris.I am a trained performer.Hello again.You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.No, really.Yeah, just an idea I had.Just an idea I had.C'mon, let's go to bed.I would too know what to do with you.Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid I\u0092m in love with somebody else.I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?I'll keep that in mind, sir.The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.Shit.I won't be late. I just have to listen to Lester's sexual fantasies and drink carrot juice for a little while. It's a job thing.I gotta go back to work. Yeah, okay. You too. Okay. Bye.I just wanted to say \u0093hi.\u0094 Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.Great.

Maxine?I'm right?That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!Maxine.Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.Yessir.That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.Buy you a drink, Maxine?Yeah. But enough about me.What'll you have?I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something.I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...That's the usual?I\u0092m not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.I mean, I am really attracted to you.No, wait! I like your tits. I love your tits. I want to fuck you.Well, I'm a puppeteer...Hi.Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. We\u0092re supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing, this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is.Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.I'm sorry. How was your evening?The ferret?Right.Yeah. You want a beer?All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little. I'll be in soon. A little while.Tell me, Craig, why do you love puppeteering? Well, Maxine, I'm not sure exactly. Perhaps it's the idea of becoming someone else for a little while. Being inside another skin. Moving differently, thinking differently, feeling differently. Interesting. Would you like to be inside my skin, Craig? Think what I think? Feel what I feel? More than anything. Maxine. It's good in here, Craig. Better than your wildest dreams.Hi.Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...Please, let me explain.It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.Another evil secret of the 7 1/2 floor.Holy shit. Maxine is gonna love this.Dr. Lester. . .Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....Thank you, sir.Bullshit.Whoa! What the hell? Where am I?Holy shit! It's that actor guy. Shit! What's his name? That actor guy! What's happening? Am I inside him? Am I in his brain? Am I him? Is he me? Does he know I'm here? My brain is reeling! Is his brain reeling?John Malkovich! Of course!John fucking Malkovich!Ahhhh!Don't you want to know what happened to me?This is important!There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.Tickets to Malkovich?But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.You wanted to be partners with me?Really? But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!Oh. Maxine.Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.What?Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.I'll meet you on the turnpike.Me too, babe.Okay. Maybe tomorrow.We'll talk about it in the car.You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.Dr. Lester...No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually. In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.My kingdom for your portal, Maxine.Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?Lotte, Maxine. Maxine, Lotte.Why aren't you at work?What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right.Yeah, okay. I'll pick you up.How was it?Why?So how was it? What was he doing?You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.After dinner I'll show you my puppets.You?My God.Come in!Please, have a seat.Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.Tell your friends.This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.You're insane.I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.What?No they're not.You've always loved the animals.What's that?Oh, Lot...What about Maxine?We wish.You were him last night, weren't you?And he was with her.We?Don't forget me.Life is confusing, isn't it?I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated. No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.Are you torturing me on purpose?I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.You're evil, Maxine.Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.Shut up!Tell her you need to see her.Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.Lesson number one: Be careful what you teach your parrot.I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.You're glowing again.It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.I'm a puppeteer.Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.Holy shit, yes!Holy shit! He said what I said!Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!I did it, sweetie. I moved his arm across your girlfriend's glorious tit. I made him talk. And, oh, there was the beginning of sensation in the fingertips. Ummmm-mmmm! It's just a matter of practice before Malkovich becomes nothing more than another puppet hanging next to my worktable. Coffee?Hey! Break it up! Break it up! Everybody gets a chance to be...Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.Sure, after a fashion.You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?So how was it?I know. I'm sorry...Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.And who's to say I won't be seeing what you're seeing... in court?Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, \"he's some kind of monster.\"I love you so much.But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.I'll tell you all about it when I get home.Squatter's rights, Lester.Who are you?Oh.Okay. Sorry. I didn't know.I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.He's a lucky man. Do I know him?The iguana?Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.I'm sorry for everything.You came up here looking for the portal?And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.You'll have me, after all I've done to you?I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life.

Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad. Hi, are you Craig's wife?Hi, uh. Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. \"Ever want to be someone else?\" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. \"Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding...\"Let her go, Craig. I mean \u0093him.\"You better hurry. Traffic.Davey? Max. Get me John Malkovich's home phone? That's great. Love ya and owe ya.Mr. Malkovich?You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...Hi. I'm so glad you decided to come. I'm Maxine.And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.Whatever you're having.Ah.The way I see it, the world is divide into those go after what they want and those who don't. The passionate ones, the ones who go after what they want, may not get what they want, but they remain vital, in touch with themselves, and when they lie on their deathbeds, they have few regrets. The ones who don't go after what they want... well, who gives a shit about them anyway?Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.Only to John, sweetie. I'm sorry. Thanks for a wonderful dinner. No hard feelings, partner.No.No. Don't be an ass.You can be John Malkovich.Two hundred dollars, please.So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.Crackpot.Yes?When?Thanks so much for coming over.So, do you enjoy being an actor?I love you, Lotte.Do you mind?Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.You're late.I've fallen in love.You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers.Oooh, doll. I love this new devil-may-care side of you. Alrighty, I'll track down Lover-boy, and I'll see both of you in one hour. Exactamundo.Oh, Lotte... Oh, sweetie...A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.Lotte, this is so good...Lotte? Is that you?Oh, Lotte...Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.Darling!Let him try.How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...One hour.Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.I can explain about the portal, darling.Oh shut up. Craig, darling are you in there?Lotte called me.Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.You still there, sweets?Wow. Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.I'd love to see your work.That was incredible. You're brilliant!You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!Stay in him forever?Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.No one would ever have to know its not him.Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!It's okay, my sweet.Now excuse us, we have an entertainment legend to create.No thanks.Vegas.This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...Bad dream, darling?You've got to be kidding.Malkovich is our meal ticket. You can't back out because of some stupid dream.Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.Yeah what?!I'm Maxine. I produced the evening with Malkovich.Yeah, we'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.Keep your eyes in your pants, old timer.You'd better turn on the pyrotechnics, lover, 'cause right now you're running neck and neck with the dead president.
