Whattaya like? Whattaya want? Nice try, bud -And you're only like 299 thousand short of what you'd need for law school.Piece of pie -I don't know...Psychology maybe, I don't know. I know it's not cool to say so, but I'd like to contribute something to society, even if -Ever try the rock, hey?The deodorant thing. It's salts or something, it comes in like a...it looks like some kinda hippie crystal.Perspire, Ginny. You lightly -Waiting for somebody? He shakes his head. She can't help noticing he's very handsome.I'll give you a minute to look over -No.No, I don't tell my name.Oh.Finneaan's Wake by James Joyce. A friend told me it's the hardest book in the English Language. Not the hardest hardest, just the hardest one it's actually possible to read, and I figure if I can get through that one, I can do the others.Six years. I'll be back with yourWanted to find out how smart I was so I told him I was reading the hardest book in the English language.I think he's just a dick.I know -Okay, so he likes me.I don't know him.I didn't notice.He's cuter than me?? tinny gives her a long stare; this is obviously a favoriteTB, coleslaw, and so forth. You don't really write books, do you?I don't read Finnecan's Wake either.Who's the rose for? He shrugs. She's busy, so she starts to go:Enjoy your grub, huh? She's seven feet away when she hears:Was it two hundred or five?No. Hey. Thank you. He nods, keeps going.I... I can't believe you actually said something.You sure,you love me?For ever and ever? He stops dancing. Senses the real issue beneath her questions:Oh yeah.How soon can we get out of here? He hoists her into his arms and carries her off the floor. Applause from the GUESTS. It's a grand romantic gesture. You have to wonder if Mitch is just a little too good to be true...It's Slim, is he there? Water is flooding down the barstool; she's miscarried.Well, will you please just... Just tell him I'm sorry, okay?I lost this one too.Who was that?Hey.Oh.You just paged my husband, right?It's too late to deny it. Tell me your - A rustle on the other end -Don't hang upl Don't be a cowardl Silence.Just your name. That's the least you could do, don't you think? A simple plea, one woman to another...How can you do this to Gracie? He doesn't say anything.Darcelle paged you. That' s where you're going, right? Yeah. Wow. Mitch? Can you please? Can you sit here with me? He does. She doesn't know where to start, how to talk about it...She's French?No.Yes.Mitch?, I can't... I couldn't stand for this to... I'm happy, I've really been happy, and I don't want to -You... Damn it! You said I was safe with you!I smell her.Her perfume. Darcelle or whoever.How many, Mitch? How many are there? How many have there been?Including you? He contemplates his answer...and shrugs.No! No! No!I can't do this anymore! I can't! Just take it, and take it, and take it!? I'm not strong enough! I don't know who would be. I love you, okay? I love you and I'm your wife and you can't do this! You understand me?!!! No more! No more! With the same speed he attacked \"Our Hero\" at the diner, Mitch's hand shoots out like a snake striking. Slaps her. A warning: stop it and stop it now. Her face: shock. Confusion. Outrage. She raises her hand to her cheek. Touches her skin where his fist landed... He reads her expression and is almost amused:No. You can't. He hits her again, this time with a closed fist.It's your rules.And if I don't like the rules??Tomorrow may be great.Tomorrow will be great. He appears to miss her inference.Your mother.I'm supposed to bring Gracie tomorrow. Maybe I better cancel.I gotta pick up Gracie at pre-school.What??It's your loaf of bread.Where are you?Why didn't you tell me you were going to -When are you coming home?Educate me.I want to be happy. He's not sure of her subtext, but he's willing to give her the benefit of the doubt :He'll come after me and kill me. Mitch overhears this, smiles.Wow ... whattaya think, Toots?Jesus, are you okay?He scare you? Joe shakes his head - more at Mitch than in answer to her question.I'm dangerous to know right now.At the restaurant?Hey. Gin. You okay?What?The line went dead. Joe stares at her, concerned. She presses redial, and we hear THE PHONE start to ring... She- goes to the window, parts the curtain: OUTSIDE in the street, the FBI MEN sit in their car - No answer on the phone. Slim looks at Joe and shakes her head: this isn't good.I know you don't want to see me or know about me, but I am desperate, I had nowhere else to go...I need your belg! You want me dead? He shrugs affably and leads her into his office -You are my Dad, Jupiter. When Mom died, I wrote you, you didn't answer. I didn't have enough money to bury her, that was really fun.No, you had help.I thought you should meet your granddaughter.And yes, we need money. To survive.(stunned...} Well. Now I know.Used to be if I did something nasty, my temper got the better of me?, I'd wonder where the hell it came from. Thanks for clearing that up.Wait. Wait. What're you...? Who're you...?Hello? Where are we going? The Driver answers her in a Middle-Eastern language. Gracie looks alarmed.It's okay, Sweetheart, they're friends of Phil's.You're not afraid to help me?No. Phil, wait a minute, I -I know, but -What about the police? The fire. Do they -2? That's good on a race-horse, Gin, but for Gracie?, to lose both parents? Besides, this is me, i couldn't kill anybodylEven so. I'm not that kind of person, okay? Ginny nods reluctantly. She's not sure the subject is closed.Yes, I lost my birth certificate - BIRTH CERTIFICATE for Erin Shleeter in Slim's hand - SOCIAL SECURITY CARD, in her hand - DRIVER'S LICENSE, with Slim's photo: her hair's a different color and she wears glasses. The name is Erin Shleeter,. DRESS SHOP: new clothes, new outfits, new look, new Slim -You're not the Queen of England anymore either. Gracie nods fatalistically, stares out the window. Flat voice:I'm thinking. Beat.Anybody talks to you, hit the horn.I need the best lawyer in town.Please. Just a name.Watch how it's done. 117 Slim goes to the Receptionist's desk:Hi. Is Mr. Toiler with someone?I'm not a crazy person. She walks past the Receptionist -I know, but I'm desperate. My husband keeps trying to kill me, and I need to talk to somebody who's smart, okay?, smarter than me at least. This is all the money I have - well, all but twenty - it's almost 500, and I'll give you all of it if you'll just listen to what... ... just two minutes, okay? Please? She's so charming and intense and discombobulated, he can't help but give in.He...he already did..That's all? You're not gonna help me?I gotta make you a solemn promise, Grace. Gracie is, of course, fast asleep.Ever since you were born ... well-one day I started to think of all the awful things that were gonna happen. People you'd love who'd die, or leave you, betray you, break your heart... .Physical injuries: broken bones or sickness or guys who hurt you some way... And I thought that if I could protect you even once, from any of those, if I could absorb any part of that myself...I had to make sure you weren't followed.There's a credit card and cash. It's on me, but make no calls home, or to Phil. Think of it as a vacation till the Orca reopens. Toots?Take care of her, okay? Extra ice- cream and... and if you need to reach me... Just don't call your friends.In an emergency, I'm #1 on the auto- dialer. Or I'll call you. Any calls between us must run is seconds or less. Cake?Ass. Enjoy it, huh?The custody hearing's end of next month. That's my deadline.He's a lot bigger.He's a lot stronger.No way.It takes.twice as much energy to swing and miss as to swing and hit.That's not possible -You're saying -For the sake of this exercise, he hits me. He's standing over her. She looks completely vulnerable.I don't care what you want. This almost makes him smile; he's getting to like her.So?Good..I hope so. The English guy is good too.What? I thought Jupiter was like all-powerful, king of the Gods? Oh yeah. One more thing. At some point.. .not right now 'cause it'd be phony ...I need you to acknowledge that I'm your kid. She walks away. He stares after her. Hint of a smile comes to his face.You sure this'll work?Thanks, I will. She leaves, taking out her cell phone. FOLLOW HER as she goes:Yes. Tony. Could you please tell Mrs. Tyler that I'll call her around f our this afternoon.It's closed?And I'd guess whoever owns it isn't a very nice person.Why here?People on the street?We were hoping to see some action, but it looks like they're closed. The Shady Character stares back. He is ve skeptical. He watches Slim and Alex walk off down the block. Alex mutters under his breath:She's coming day after tomorrow, then we're flying to L.A. I was thinking after the hearing, maybe I could bring her by.I was out in the country, Mrs. T. I'm in a big city now, meeting with my lawyer, so there're lots of cell phones. No one can trace this.Say something else.They have to think I'm still here, so use my cell phone, tomorrow, to call my dad. Autodial 2. Slim presses the autodial number, then SEND, and motions for Tova to put on Slim's gray coat. It fits Tova perfectly.Hey, it's me.I don't know, I'm getting some bronchial thing.Yeah.Tomorrow stay in, order room service. Call him twice. Keep it brief. \"Hello, I don't feel well...\"Go around the corner, eat at Guido's.Green trenchcoat. Tova nods and Slim takes off her own wig. Short dark hair.Wish me luck, huh?Luck has nothing to do with it. Tova smiles.I'm in.Can you stay off the phone?I hope so. She hangs up. Retrieves her duffle bag from its hiding place and pulls out tools, equipment, etc. Picks up a screwdriver and starts searching the apartment, checking the phone line, following it to the place where it enters the apartment. MONTAGE INTERCUT WITH FLASHES of Slim' a face: a running tab on her emotions. Intensity, focus, determination, fear,. ..and, as the sequence builds: concern about what she doing...\". .thanks for letting me come talk about Gracie. And I'm glad you're willing to admit your temper, and - let's not mince words - the physical abuse you subjected me to.\" And glances at SECOND LETTER:\"Perhaps with your new attitude, we can really work something out. Per your last letter, I'll see you the evening of...\" She puts the letters in the drawer where the pistol was. They're not in envelopes; they're loose, open. She picks up the metal detector, resumes her search. The machine beeps insistently around his desk. She can't find anything. Finally she discovers a false bottom on one of the drawers: a second gun is in there. With the gun are papers: reports from private detectives looking for her, an assessment of his custody rights... She hides the guns in the bottom of the laundry hamper. Finds a photo of herself with Mitch and Gracie. Rips it up. Puts the metal detector back in the duffle. Changes into sweatshirt and sweatpants. Takes the distinctive red bag out of the duffle. There's a machine inside. She plugs it in, tucks it behind the couch. Puts her cell phone beside it.You know. What you told me. Beat. On Slim's face as:Yeah. She hangs up, turns the machine back on and stashes her cell phone. With simple ease, she lowers herself onto the chair. Facing the door. Waiting in the fading light...Fair to whom? As he realizes her meaning, she moves into the open area between two couches. She has no weapon. She's barefoot, in her sweats, feet spread for balance, arms just slightly raised. Compared to him: she's tiny. He moves toward her.This is what you wanted, right? What you were going to San Francisco for: the chance to get me alone? He lunges for her; she slides to the side and he misses. He begins to stalk her. And as he stalks, she moves backward, slowly and gracefully, in the way she was practicing.Self defense is not ,murder. This stops him cold.. He lowers his hands a moment. Stares at her, trying to assimilate this new information...So far you're attacking me. He lunges, almost hits her, rushes in - She has to leap sideways with great speed and dexterity: jumps over the couch to avoid being hit. He also jumps over the couch, but his balance isn't as good, and she's waiting for him as he stumbles - With perfect balance and full force, she slugs him in the nose. He goes down. Stays there. For the first time it occurs to him: this might not be easy. He climbs to his feet, feels his nose: blood.You see? I'm just defending myself. He resumes stalking her. Only he's angry now, and it's scary.I told you. Self-defense. I came here, as arranged in our letters, to talk about Gracie -In the drawer where your pistol was. You just left prints all over them. He stares at her, stunned in every way. Touches his forehead, feels the blood...You attacked me, I fought back. And of course if you never touch me...I'm confused, Mitchy. Aren't you a man?It's a martial-arts cliche, honey. A weapon throws you off balance -You see? He turns toward her, pain on his face, holding his hand - And she truly attacks for the first time. Smashes her fist against his head - He flies back, bounces vs. the wall. As he comes off it, she punches him again - He roars with rage, lunges at her, head first, great speed - She hurtles him in the same direction, increasing speed - Right into the opposite wall. The top of his head hits the wall. He shudders like someone in a cartoon: a spasm running head toI can't, Gin.Yeah.Listen to me! I did it, but I can't do it! I can't kill him! Behind Slim, out of focus: movement, a soft blur...I know -I know all that! I have to, but I can't! I'm not a killer! I'm not him! Mitch. Crazed and bloody face. In his hand: the wooden lamp. She senses something, turns her head slightly to one side - - so the lamp does not land quite flush on her skull. Still sends her crashing to the floor. Now she does not move. He stands over her. Looks insane: bloody, dazed, beaten: but triumphant.Hi.Gin, he's ...he hit his...he's not breathing.Yeah.Okay. As Ginny talks, Slim puts the cell-phone blocker into the duffle and carries the duffle to the rear of the building.See you soon. She drops the cell phone out the bedroom window into the water. Then the duffle. They both sink.This time be nice to her.Yeah.

We give 'em food, energy, so they can go out and save Western Civilization - A bell rings, a CUSTOMER comes in, and the owner of the place, PHIL sticks his head between them:Not that we noticed.Excuse me?You're saying I sweat.I'll remember that. Your turn, I'm sweatin' too much. Slim gives her a look, grabs a menu, goes over to where the new customer, whom we will call for the moment OUR HERO, is seated.What'd he say?He likes you.Slim...he was in yesterday -And he's back today with a rose, he pulls you into conversation. Honey, if you can't tell he likes you, you need to study psychology.Do you like him?What's that got to do with it? Slim: he is a major piece of cake/piece of pie.Trust me. Carrot cake. And when a guy like that - cuter than you? - he actually likes you -Hey. Wise up, huh? No-one is ever gonna go for you 'cause of your looks.Don't eat at their ice cream, huh? They squeal with pleasure and run off. Ginny turns back, resumes dancing with JOE :So this was during college or after?What was wrong with you? I mean-why'd you and Slim break up?Evolution? You were going the wrong direction, bud.Why am I not believing this?My kids are out for the night, and...I didn't propose, huh? I just want to have... a brief and completely unsatisfying sexual encounter.Men are land mines. Some you trigger the first week, others it's years in. Problem is: you want a man man, meaning his veins run thick with testosterone, which is good 'cause he can fuck your brains out but he can also turn around, no warning, and beat your brains out too.Relax, Phil. Nobody's talkin' about your dick here, okay? Phil brings Slim an iced tea and slice of pie:Mitch is in construction, Phil.Even if he didn't. My aunt? She got a restraining order? When it was up, this slimeball beat her into a coma.'Cause he's a man, Phil! He's psychotic! You're leaving him today. Right now.She heard it.She's not asleep, okay? She's coming out any second. Phil nods. They wait. She does not come out. Ginny shakes her head, looks at her watch.Do it again. Teddy nods. Cups his hands, coos like a dove... They wait again. Beat.It'd be crazy to wake him. If anything's wrong, she'll flick the lights. .Right? Phil nods skeptically, and Ginny herself doesn't seem so sure. They look at the house-and wait. . .and wait... We want to scream: \"GO IN! GO! SAVE HER!\" Suddenly something. Subtle. Was that A SOUND from inside??? They go on alert. . .step forward... listen more closely... But hear nothing unusual.She's alive -What?Yeah, right during dinner. Like anybody's gonna bomb a diner in Carpenteria.You know Phil. He won't leave his ship. We're doin' cleanup.What?You got more than a bad feeling, hon. You got a bad husband.All right, all right, take it easy -Screw the police, we're outta here.Can you run?It's Michael Johnson, Phil.No letters, Slim, but you can callYou know, I keep having a bad idea.

How much is it? Our Hero has a completely blank look on his face -You and your friend. Yesterday. Was it 200 or 500 or - ?He bet his friend he could get in your pants in less than twelve hours, starting noon today. Our Hero rises to his feet and pushes Mitch in the chest, which looks like a stupid move, since Mitch is bigger -Don't come back here, buddy. Ever. Our Hero nods nervously. Mitch steps back 3 inches, just far enough to let our Hero leave. Which he does with considerable relief. Slim's leaning vs. the counter, shaken, tears in her eyes - Mitch tugs his baseball cap, mutters as he heads for the door:Sorry to get in your business.If I'd kept my mouth shut, I'd'a felt bad later. Good luck, huh? She nods. He ambles out the door. A touch of the cowboy in him. She shakes her head, looks at Ginny. Ginny gestures as if to say, well? At first Slim doesn't get it. Ginny gestures more urgently: Come on. What're you waiting for? She looks toward the door - Slim follows her look. PUSH IN ON SLIM'S FACE as she tries to work up the courage... Just as she starts toward the door, we:Uh-huh...You're safe with me, Slim. You're safe, and it's okay to be happy. We deserve it. They kiss. Others stop to watch: how cute. Phil comes over, waits. When they break:That's very sweet -He really loves you. She nods, not quite picking up how odd his statement is: of course he loves her; she nicked him to give her away. Mitch turns her toward him and slips his hands inside the top of her dress . He pulls her to him, whispers:You gonna give me babies?How soon?Hi. We've been driving around, and my wife has completely fallen in love with your house.We want to buy it. The Home Owner's jaw drops as Mitch gestures toward his bulgingMy wife wants it for our family.Sure you are.That's the price. Don't worry, it's well over-market.I know. That's just it. So before you say no again, think how miserable one determined crazy person can make you. Miserable today, miserable tomorrow, miserable for every single day until the day you sell. We glimpse the Home Owner's will just starting to crumble...Your kids are grown, you'll be happier in a smaller place. MOVE OFF the Owner's face... SLOW PAN TO the window of the house .the SENSE that time is passing... and when we reach the window, we see SLIM inside. MOVE THROUGH the window...You saw the doctor? It's so obvious from her face that she barely needs to'say it:Can I hold her? The Nurse looks at Slim,. who nods, and gives Mitch the baby.She looks just like my baby pictures. His cell phone rings again. As if the previous call had been a signal. Slim looks at him as the phone keeps ringing. With some difficulty, juggling the baby, he turns the phone off. But he doesn't look at Slim.I don't know. Who cares? Some construction thing, I guess. She stares at him. He stares at the baby.Isn't she the most beautiful thing you ever saw in your life? Slim nods cautiously.Hey.I'm about to get out.I have to go to back to work, I'm just doing this to wake myself up.Hey. She doesn' t say anything. He approaches her. Some instinct keeps him from speaking. He sees she's holding his phone, the silly toy...She isn't important.You're important.And Gracie. She nods.You won't have to. Believe me. She's nothing, she's no-one -You are, Slim. You are. I promise. They fall into an embrace. We feel how keenly they need each other.What?What does it matter? A stunning statement. Even more stunning because of the casual way he says it.ID I mean what're you saying here, that I don't deserve to get laid? Please. I'm a man, Slim. With the pregnancies, Gracie, you don't have time and energy like you used to, and I understand that, I really do. Men and women have different needs, and that's okay. Darcelle is willing to take care of it, and maybe that's better for everybody.Calm down, Slim - Wild, violently invading his space and assaulting his authority, screaming at him, her face just inches from his:What, I can't hit you?You want to fight? I'm a mom, honey; it's no contest. She's silent, but we see her reaction: Oh yeah??You with me?Yeah. She keeps her voice meek so as not to offend:If you don't \"like\" them?! She nods cautiously.That's right.Yeah. Today is the price you pay for having such a good life. She stares at him.I'm going out. She says nothing.Who you calling?What're you gonna tell her?.I'll understand. I really will.If I see that thought even cross your mind, I'll kill you. There. He's said what he needs to. He walks toward his car. She shuts the window. Stares after him. In an odd and defiant way, she starts to whistle. Loudly. To herself. Almost daring him.It made me nervous when I couldn't reach you. Slim shrugs. He stares at her. Smiles. His voice so soft and calm:Slim. I'm a determined person. I was determined to have you, and I did. This house...the company...I am, and always will be, a person who gets what he wants. You can either share in my success or leave us right now. Which way you wanna go? Beat.Good. With a sudden shock, Slim sees Gracie staring at Mitch: the girl has picked up on his tone. Slim glances at Mitch to see if he notices Gracie's expression. He doesn't.Another step and you're dead. Mitch emerges from darkness. Light glints off his pistol. Thirty feet behind him: Gracie's sleeping on the couch. Mitch moves and they stare in horror. Lying at his feet is Slim's body.. Pain springs from Ginny's throat, she rushes to Slim - Mitch rams the gun into her head:Didn't you hear me?i Ginny feels Slim's pulse, says to Phil:Unless you go, your brains'11 be on imy rug iI could give a shit. Slim makes a SOUND as Ginny strokes her head... Mitch FIRES the gun into the wall over Ginny's head. Muffled sound: silencer. But he has everyone's attention now:This is your last chance.I don't want to say this in front of the group, but you're just a rug-head, nobody'll believe you. You go to the cops, it's her word against mine. They'll find drugs in her bureau... Or her car, whatever.That's right.You hear that? That's why she loves me. Nobody cares like I do. The others stare at him in astonishment, but continue toward the door. Mitch leans toward Slim, whispers:See you soon.I know mine was short, but she made other calls, right? Ginny?, or my mother? He crosses to a map with colored pins. Sticks in another one -Good. Good. Keep it up. Isn't he here yet? Great, yeah, send him in. To our shock, the person who enters is the man previously known as \"Our Hero.\" ROBBIE and Mitch are good buddies:Hey.Look, will you tell what's his face, Lieutenant Harris: I bought his Miata, I paid for his rec room, can he please keep his patrolmen from hassling my guys?I didn't bring you for that.Yeah, but coming from you...I know where she is, Robbie. More or less.I need you to find her. Take yourWho else'm I gonna get? Huh? She stole my fucking childlShe made calls from these places -She's not stupid, okay? It says on the Net it takes 84 seconds to trace a call; she keeps hers well under.Okay: say she lives within a two hour radius...Wanna know a secret? Whispering to her, his hands moving to her neck...Cops need a body. Without your body, they'll think you disappeared again. Her hands at his hands, clawing, trying to pry them loose -Coffee?I'll call you. She stares at him a second.Sure. She sees how \"eager\" he is to talk to her again. Irritated, she scribbles the number quickly, hands.it to him -Thanks for everything.Janie? Hey.If it was pleasure, you'd be going too. No, I'm going down to get my daughter. Slim's reaction to this...Sure, the custody hearing's here next week, but it looks like Gracie's being brought to San Francisco and my ex-wife ...well, seems like she completely vanished. ON SLIM. His words echo his threats when he was trying to strangle her in her hallway.Right off the face of the earth. I doubt they'll ever find her this time. Slim's jaw tightens. When we come back to Mitch, he's dressed and packing his briefcase.Yeah, I want her to meet you. We'll call when we get in.Yeah.You have my guns.Then someone's here with you.'Cause it'd be stupid. Silence is her answer.You're sayin' this is man to man?That's what I meant: man against woman - you sure that's fair? The lights go back on. Slowly Slim comes out from hiding...I don't understand, Slim. How does this work for you? She ignores his words. Watches his eyes and his chest. Wants to know where he's going to attack.I mean: this is carefully thought out, right? She does not respond. He throws three punches. None of them hits her. He's unfazed, keeps stalking...But say you succeed - beat me up or whatever. You're not going to murder me... Her expression remains neutral, focused. He takes this to be agreement.So all you've done is further piss me off.You don't have the guts. She just looks at him. He blinks, worried for an instant. Covers it with a smile:It's not self-defense when you break in here and attack me.If you fail, you can count on this: you'll never see Gracie again. She reacts - He sees it, rushes her - Punching as he goes. From the standpoint of pure physics, he makes a terrifying force. Until: She steps back, grabs his arm, whips him vs. the brick wall - He hits it, bounces off. Cut on his forehead, blood streaming down his face. He stares at her... breathing hard... trying to put it together:You really ...you think you'll kill me and get away with it?lLetters? There are no -This doesn't bother me, Slim. I don't care how long it takes. We both know: Ionly have to hit you once. Once, and it's over. She laughs at him. This is the last thing he expected and the last thing he can stand. He rushes at her again, fast - She starts left - He blocks her way - She starts right - Again he's blocking her - She lunges to the left, through a narrow space - He punches, grazing her hair; punches again, just missing, and a third time. We feel the awesome power behind these blows. She's in the clear again. Smiles casually. Clearly part of her strategy is to keep him angry:Listen to me, bitch. Ginny's silent.if you value your children, don' t call anybody. It's over, okay? It's all over. He throws the phone on the couch and moves back toward Slim, lamp clenched tight in his fist.", "clean_line": "settle bet hero completely blank look face friend yesterday bet friend pants hours

Suddenly: tender and insecure and almost comic, she looks at him...Well. It's only a lake, but we like it.Coming up, whattaya say?!Is there anybody who likes ice cream? Gracie whoops - The doorbell rings -Yes?Go ahead.You got a search warrant?Can I she the warrant? First FBI Man ignores this.Who're you looking for? The FBI Man gives him a sarcastic glance.A mother taking her own child isn't kidnapping. I don't think you're FBI at all. This elicits no response. Joe moves to where he can see the other two guys.

It can't be who they think it is... it rings again. Joe goes to it. Hesitates. Answers:Hello?Hello, yes, how are you?

Charming.Sure you should -Slim. You can be here anytime. She nods. They both know what he's saying: if he's willing to take this kind of risk, he's either a very good friend or he's still in love with her .Oh. He said you should call your friends.Sorry, my plane was delayed -What is this, a treasure hunt? I'm gonna spend the whole weekend flying around?I can guarantee one thing in my lifetime: I was not followed. He embraces \"Erin\" and \"Queen E.\"\" The CAMERA looks past them to where Robbie might be watching. He's not.Where do you work? \"Erin\" gives him a look: she's not telling.

She nods.She tell you how terrible I was?I didn't forget -Please kiss me, Slim. I know we're not supposed to, it's against house rules and all, but for me to come all this way and feel the way I do and for us to not even - She kisses him - And he kisses back. And they stop. Incredible self control. Lie next to each other-hold hands again...You're a great person, Slim. You're a great person just like your daughter. She squeezes his hand.
