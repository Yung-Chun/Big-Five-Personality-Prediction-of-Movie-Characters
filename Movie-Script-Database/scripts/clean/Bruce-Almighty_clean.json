{"Bruce-Almighty": {"BRUCE": {"raw_line": "Oh, God, no! The hair's wrong. This is a bad sign. We really need to get a make-up person?! The segment producer, ALLY LOMAN, steps over.A hair net? I'm not wearing a hair net. I just did the hair.You guy's should tell me this before hand, this is like a huge waste of...moose. Bruce spreads the hair net, bends down out of frame, comes up looking ridiculous and very disgruntled.Remind me to swing by an elementary * school after this and serve lunch. Ally laughs.For three decades the Kowolski Family Bakery has been a mainstay in downtown Buffalo. Known for their sinfully rich, cream filled, deep fried polski pierogis. And the occasional sugar induced coma that follows. Today, in honor of their 30 year anniversary, Momma Kowolski and her sons Gustov and Vol, decided to do something, a little bit different. Tell me guys, how did this idea come about?Wow. Fascinating. Bruce steps up to the HUGE COOKIE.The previous Buffalo cookie record was 3 feet, 17 inches baked by Gladys Pelsnick. But this behemoth cookie clearly proving that Gustov and Vol have much more free time. The Kowolski brothers and all celebrate in the background, toasting with big mugs of milk. Bruce steps forward, looks dramatically at camera, slow zoom in as he speaks.As we witness the ceremonial toasting with milk it makes one pause and think. What are we really looking at here?Is it just a big cookie or does this cookie represent the pride of Buffalo? Our dedicated and hard working citizens the key ingredient, with a few nuts thrown in. And finally, the love of our families which provides the warm chewy center making our beloved Buffalo the sweetest place to live.And that's the way the cookie crumbles. I'm Bruce Nolan, Eyewitness News. Bruce's hair net SLIPS UP, PUFFING HIS HAIR INTO A BUN ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD. The Kowolskis and bystanders all laugh. The frame FREEZES. We PULL BACK from the TV and find Bruce holding the remote, watching the recorded spot on TV. We are now... INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHTSo, what do you think?It sucks. It's a story about a cookie. People with eating disorders will be riveted, Dear Bruce, love the bakery piece. I can't wait to vomit so I can make room for more cookies.What? I'm cutting that. They made me wear that stupid thing. I don't even look like myself. The hair is one of the most important parts of an on camera persona. Right out of the gate, I lost the hair advantage. Grace looks at a photo,Grace. Try to stay focused here. I need your help.It's sweeps Grace. It is serious. There's an anchor job open. This is important. This is our future! Bruce points to the TV as he says \"future,\" not realizing he's pointing at the ridiculous image of himself with the hair net bun. Grace can't help but giggle.I'm never going to get anchor doing these kind of assignments. I want my work to matter.Alright. Grace holds up a photo.Yeah, so full of hopes and dreams.You look pretty intense, hun.So, you're attracted to me in some way, is that what you're trying to say? Grace rolls over onto Bruce.I was saving myself for the wedding night, but if you keep this up, I may lose my resolve. Grace stands, pulling Bruce up.Hey, that's a good line, but you need more resonance. From the diaphragm. That's the way the cookie crumbles.That's the way the cookie crumbles.Well then, let me take these clothes off and slip into my hair net. Grace laughs, Bruce joins in as they disappear into the bedroom. CUT TO: A TELEVISION SCREEN...Bruce Nolan. And this is Sixty Minutes. THE SIXTY MINUTES TICKING CLOCKNo, I'm having a great dream.

SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - MORNING Bruce pulls up in his Ford Tauras to a cluster of cars unloading kids. A 2003 MERCEDES SRL passes by.Yeah, if you want to rub your success in people's faces. Then Bruce notices a big medical van in front of the school with a BLOOD DRIVE SIGN.What's with the hubbub?Creepy. Needles, yech...I mean, it's just s o . . .C'mon, that's your...blood. It's in your body and I don't think it's supposed to come out. Besides, they stockpile that stuff. They have an endless supply frozen in a warehouse somewhere then tell everyone there's a shortage.Well, I'm IB positive. IB positive they aint touchin' me with no needle. Grace sighs in exasperation, starts out when...What's that?Well, I hope they work, cause it's going take a miracle to get me to work on time. EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY Bruce is stuck in bumper to bumper traffic. He stares at the prayer beads with a \"thanks alot\" look.This is just my luck. Bruce's BEEPER sounds. He checks it.Catch you later, lemmings 1 It's kill or be killed, only the strong survive, no guts, no glory1Thank you. EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY Bruce screeches into a space, races out of the car, bumping over a trash can, goes back to pick it up, sees a HOMELESS MAN who sits peacefully next to a paint bucket and sign boards. The various \"warnings\" change daily. Today's SIGN reads:Well, that's- Bobby, I gotta go- I'm late...Bobby, I can't, I--Mmm, delicious, I really gotta go.Can you get Kelly- Ahh... Bruce tosses the thought, digs into his pocket, fishing for cash.Really?Bobby.Keep the change.Sorry, Jack. It wasn't my fault. The traffic was -- You guys already played the spots?That's great Evan.Jack, Jack, hey. Can I talk to you for a second?Sweeps. Jack takes his sandwich and leaves. Bobby leans to Bruce.Look, Jack. Hear me out, I'm getting desperate man, I am pushing forty and what have I got to show for it? The point is, I've hit some kind of a ceiling here. Some kind of anti-Bruce barrierI And Evan is just lovin' it, by the way. He gets the good stories, he gets on sweeps. Maybe I have to be more like Evan.I can be an asshole.Yeah, I'm sorry. Bruce bends down, starts picking up Jack's food.It's just- this anchor position looming, it's gotten me nuts... He hands the plate to Jack, as sexy anchorwoman SUSAN ORTEGA saunters by.Maid of the Mist. That's always live.Evan gets the live feeds.I'm going live. In sweeps.Yes 1 You will not regret this, Jack. I will not forget you when I go national. Bruce takes off, Jack looks down, peels the sandwich off his chest. We hear children's joyous SHRIEKS... INT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - DAYGrace? INTERCUT DAY CARE AND FALLSOh, A little place called the winners circle. I'm at the Falls doing a \"live\" report.Yep, it's happenin', hun. I got sweeps and I'm live. You know what that means?This is happening for us, Grace. What we've always talked about. Jack practically came out and told me. Grace quickly switches gears. She experienced the premature- celebration before.Well, he didn't spell it out, but this is exactly what happened to Susan Ortega right before she was bumped up to the desk.I totally agree, but in the mean time you should start thinking about what coast you want to live on. Ally interrupts, indicating the time.Oh, they're calling me, I gotta go.What for? I'll get soaked.And people who are insanely ' * thirsty, I get it. *90 seconds, going live. Think anchor, think dignity, Ignore umbrella. Just have fun. CUT TO:Thank you, Susan 1 Bruce Nolan here aboard the Maid of the Mist at Niagara falls. INT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - CONTINUOUSFirst off, \"I want to add another congratulations to Evan Baxter. It's good to see what someone with real talent can accomplish when great opportunities are given to him instead of me. Anyway, I'm here, I believe with Katherine Hepburn's mom. Tell me, why did you toss the blue \"heart of the ocean\" jewel over the railing of Titanic? The Old Woman doesn't know what to say.Did you feel guilty at all letting Leonardo Decaprio freeze, while you were safe floating on the big door? Do you think he would have survived if you had taken turns, or were you too afraid to freeze your big fat ass off? INT. STUDIO CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUSWell, I guess that's the way life works, isn't it? Some people are drenched, freezing to death, on a stupid boat, with a stupid umbrella... while others who aren't fit to kiss my willy, are sitting in a nice, comfy news room, sucking up all the glory111Now, lets speak to the owner. Come on in here, Bill. Bill shakes his head \"NO\" as Bruce pulls him into frame.Bill, you.'ve been running the Maid of the Mist for 23 years. Tell me, why do you think I didn't get the anchor job?Do you think it's my hair? Maybe my teeth aren't white enough? Or like the great falls, is the bedrock of my life slowly erroding underneath me. Erroding. Erroooding. Errodiiiing... INT. NEWS ROOM - DAY All work has stopped. Stunned staffers stare at the monitor. INT.

STUDIO CONTROL ROOM - .CONTINUOUS Susan Ortega stares frozen blankly into camera. SMASH CUT TO:Hey, come on guys. What are you doin'? Just leave him alone. They turn, look at Bruce, laugh and head off. Bruce helps the Sign Guy up, looks after the Gang.Yeah, you'd better keep walkin'. They stop cold, turn back to Bruce and CHARGE AT HIM. Bruce attempts to run, but they leap on him in a big dog pile, swinging and kicking. Bruce is left with a bloody lip, lying beside his car. We hear the sound of smashing glass and scratching metal and the gang running off. Bruce slowly gets up. Reveal Bruce's car, WINDOW'S SMASHED, PAINT SCRAPED and the word \"HERO\" KEY SCRATCHED ON THE DOOR.B-e-a-utiful.God, yeah. Let's thank God. Thanks for everything, Lord. I am so honored that my horrible demise is a part of your loving and mysterious plan.Oh, don't worry, he's not listening. If he is he doesn't care. Have you seen the news lately? We got gangs, we got drugs, we got corruption. What kind of God lets that happen? Every time we cure a disease he comes up with a new one! Yeah, is this the lab? Yeah, it's God. They've just come up with a treatment for syphilis down there. I think it's time to release the tainted monkey. Oh, and there's a guy in Ohio who's praying for strength and wisdom, blind him and cut off his legs.Think about it, Grace. God is all- powerful . He could fix everything in five minutes if he wanted to.Oh, Perfect! But you're aim isn't so good, I'm over herelOf course not. It's part of the mysterious plan. Grace puts Sam outside. Returns, trying to calm Bruce.Okay? News flash: I'm not okayi And I'm not okay with the fact that you think everything is okay. I'm not okay with a mediocre job. I'm not okay with a mediocre apartment. I'm not okay with a mediocre LIFE! Bruce angrily swipes at the table knocking the photos and the photo albums to floor.Terrific. I'm drowning and you throw me a brick! Grace starts to cry.Perfect! I'll have the worst day of my life with a side order of guilt, please. I-- I don't need this. Bruce grabs his keys and heads out.Okay, God. You want me to talk to you? Then talk back. Tell me what's going on? What should I do? Give me a sign... Bruce passes a BLINKING YELLOW CAUTION LIGHT, doesn't notice. . .I'm right here. Speak to me. A PEDESTRIAN stepping into the crosswalk, steps back out of the way.All I need is some guidance. Please send me a signal. A TRUCK TRANSPORTING VARIOUS ROAD SIGNS pulls in front of Br uce . F our way s, bli nki ng. The va rie d s igns re ad: Yi eld , Wrong Way, Dead End, Do Not Enter, Stop.Oh well, I guess you don't care. Bruce spots the PRAYER BEADS hanging on the rearview mirror.Okay, we'll do it your way. Lord, I need a miracle. Please help me.Come on, where'd you go? Ah ha! AHHH! And BAM!11 BRUCE'S CAR SLAMS INTO A LIGHT POST.Okay, if that's the way you want it. The gloves are off, pal! Let me see a little wrath! Smite me oh mighty smiteri What, no pestilence no boils? Come on, you got me on the ropes, don't you want to finish me off?! You're the one who should be fired! The only one around here not doing his job is YOU! What are we, you're little pet project? A hobby you tinker with now and again? Answer me. ANSWER ME!!! A beat of silence then Bruce's BEEPER GOES OFF. He cynically chuckles at the timing, checks it, sees 772-5623.Sorry, don't know you, wouldn't call you if I did. Bruce walks off toward his wrecked car, it BEEPS AGAIN. CUT TO: CLOSE ON - AN ALARM CLOCKWell, hello again 772-5623, don't hold your breath. Bruce tosses the pager on the bed, heads for the bathroom. The beeper BEEPS. Bruce stops in his tracks, turns, opens the window, grabs the beeper and FIRES IT OUT. It SHATTERS against a telephone pole. He calmly continues to the bathroom. INT. BATHROOMOh, no. EXT. STAIR WELL - CONTINUOUS Bruce runs down the stairs carrying the trickling, Sam. EXT. APARTMENT - DAYWhat's the point? BEEP, BEEP, BEEP...Perfect. He gets out, shakes off his sopping leg, and heads inside. INT. OMNI PRESENTS - DAY Bruce enters and checks the BUILDING DIRECTORY. It reads: OMNI PRESENTS UNLTD.How would I get to room 7?What about the elevator? He points to an elevator bank a couple of steps away.What? Yeah, I mind. He continues on.Excuse me. Hello. I'm, ah, looking for whoever runs this joint...Yep, seems to be. Kinda bright, though.Oh, the elevator's broken, huh?You installed a clapper?I gotta go.Oh, this is hilarious. So you're the boss and the electrician and the janitor.How do you know my father? And how did you get my pager number?Wow, a whole drawer. Just for me? Mind if I take a look?Who are you?Sorry, it's not ringing a bell.Oh, you're God. Well that explains everything1 That's how you know everything about me. That's how you got up to the seventh floor so quickly. Well, it's really nice to meet you. Thanks for the Grand Canyon and, ah, good luck with the apocalypse. Bruce turns to leave, BUT FINDS HIMSELF WALKING RIGHT TOWARD GOD AND HIS DESK. He tries again, and again.Okay, I don't know how you're doing that, but I really gotta go. This place is obviously rigged in some way. We're on some freaky hidden camera show. ...for which I will not sign a release, by the way! But you know what, I'd be a little more impressed if you didn't use the cheesy file cabinet illusion.Okay. That's good. That's a good one. Bruce quickly puts his hands behind his back.Okay, God. How many fingers am I holding out? Bruce extends three fingers.Okay, how about now. He quickly pulls in two fingers.AAAHHHlYou stay away from me! I don't know what your doing. But whatever you're doing is probably actionable!Job? Wh at job?Sure, whatever you say, Pal. He turns to go but GOD STANDS BEFORE HIM in the Janitor uniform, holding the mop.Okay, that did not happen. He races to his car stepping in the SAME PUDDLE, but this time his foot doesn't sink, he WALKS RIGHT ACROSS IT. He paus es f or a bea t --No.I'm having a breakdown. That's what it is. Just a normal, everyday psychotic episode, brought on by tumor or brain lesion... We hear the car wind down to nothing. Bruce releases the key pounds the steering wheel in frustration.Come on, startI The car INSTANTLY starts.Well, that was lucky. Bruce backs up, peels out. MUSIC UP: \"HE'S GOT THE WHOLE WORLD IN HIS HANDS\"Okay, just relax here. I did not meet God and I do not have his powers. If that was God, then I'm Mario Andretti. Instantly, Bruce's car PEELS OUT, races through traffic, dodging and passing cars right and left.AAAHHHHHHHH!J!Si, dovete venire sopra per il pranzo un certo tempo. Bruce reacts shocked. The crew backs off and urges him on in Italian.It isn't real, it isn't real, it isn't real... An older. Sally Kirkland-type WAITRESS, order pad in hand, stands listening to Bruce with a raised eyebrow.Oh hi, ah, coffee please. The waitress pours him a cup.No, that's okay.Alright, okay. She heads off. Bruce sits thinking. Could it be real? He looks at the SUGAR down at the end of the table, holds out his hand and the SUGAR SLIDES ACROSS THE TABLE RIGHT INTO HIS HAND. The CREAMER slides into his other hand. Bruce is half scared, half thrilled. He pours some cream and sugar into his cup, looks around the table.Excuse me I need a spoooo... Bruce chokes up a spoon into his hands, wipes it off with his napkin.That's alright, I found one. The Old Man eyes Bruce suspiciously, gets up and moves further down the counter. The Waitress sets down the soup, heads off, then turns back.What?Okay.You- He- Thy...Rules ?Well the two extra fingers freaked me out a little bit.Uh huh. Can I-ask why?This is amazing.Where are you going?God can't take a vacation. Can he? Can you?And he saw that it was good. He spots a mannequin in a store window display, wearing a cool, casu al outfit. He closes his eyes. When he opens them, HE'S WEARING THE COOL NEW OUTFIT and the mannequin is dressed in his clothes. He checks his reflection. . . better. Bruce rounds the corner, sees the SAME GANG that beat him up, hanging out in the alley.B-e-a-utifullHey guys, remember me? The gang members turn to Bruce. HOOD #1 Oh look, it's the hero. HOOD #2 Hungry for another can of whoop- ass? HOOD #3 Your stereo sounds great in my car, man. He and a couple other gang members laugh and high-five.Look, I don't want to fight you guys. So as soon as you apologize, I'll be on my way. A beat, then the Hoods BURST OUT LAUGHING. A few circle behind, surrounding Bruce. HOOD #1 Oh, yeah. I'll apologize... The day a monkey climbs out of my butt.What a coincidence. That's today. The Hood gets a PAINED LOOK, starts gyrating around, then a MONKEY comes climbing out the back of his baggy pants. The Big Guy looks at Hood #1.Now I'm going to have to teach the rest of you guys a lesson.Just me... and me... ANOTHER BRUCE steps out from behind a stack of crates.And me, and me, and me, me, me, me, me and me and me. As Bruce talks, DUPLICATE BRUCE'S begin popping out from various spots, a doorway, hanging down from a fire escape, a dumpster pops open, six Bruce's jump out.Okay guys, Kum Ba Yal The Bruce's jog over, leaping and diving into Bruce's body.I'll take it from here. Bruce takes a deep breath, OPENS HIS MOUTH WIDE, RELEASING A SWARM OF LOCUSTS --Back home for you, little one. The monkey takes off back into the alley, as we see HOOD #1 stumbling to his feet. HOOD #1 NoI NOOOOO1 He takes off running, the monkey in hot pursuit.I AM THE LORD THY BRUCE ALMIGHTY. MY WILL BE DONE I Bruce poses in dramatic god-like form, lightning crashes behind him. He is an awesome god. INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHTWhat if God was one of us. . . Just a slob like one of us... Just a stranger on a bus... Trying to make his way. . . Grace reacts a bit surprised by Bruce's happy tone, she gets up, opens the door and there stands BRUCE, beaming smile, holding a very unique BOUQUET OF FLOWERS....home.You can call me Bruce.Who wouldn't be on a night like this? For you. Grace takes the flowers, gives Bruce a kiss, still sizing up his mood.It's a totally new breed. A cross pollination between tulips and Daisies. I call them Todayzees.Nothing of this world. Why?Last night, I was only human. Bruce backs out of the kitchen seductively. INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Bruce breezes through, casually instructs the stereo as he passes.CD 4, Track 7. The Stereo illuminates and Barry White music plays. EXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS Bruce opens the doors, steps onto the balcony. He surveys the cloudy sky, reaches up with his hand and ERASES THE CLOUDS, LIKE ON A CHALKBOARD. Still not completely satisfied he reaches up toward the moon and makes a LASSOING MOTION, THEN BEGINS TO PULL. CUT TO: OUTER SPACE - BEHIND THE MOON Earth far off in the distance - And with a THUNDEROUS RUMBLE the MOON starts MOVING CLOSER TO EARTH.We shouldn't waste it. Bruce starts kissing her neck. Grace turns, .they kiss and a METEOR SHOWER lights the sky behind them. The kiss ends.Bedroom.Standing at the door with both arms extended toward the bathroom like an WARLOCK CASTING A SPELL. Suddenly the light hits him from the open bathroom door and he quickly strikes a casual pose. Grace stands in the open doorway, panting like an animal. She dives on Bruce, attacking him. INT. KITCHEN - MORNING ON TV - THE MORNING NEWSSam. Uh uh uh.Good boy.Good morning.Oo, my favey. Bruce sits, Grace sets down his plate, leans close.Heavenly?Huh?

MASTER - STREET Reveal Bruce's car is now a brand new MERCEDES 2003 VISION SLR. He starts and revs THE POWERFUL NEW ENGINE and peels out.And the last shall be first. EXT. POLICE TRAINING CENTER - DAYYeah, I had a bad day. But things are lookin' up.Just lookin' for a story.I don't know. My instinct tells me there's something more.Since the disapearence of Teamster president Jimmy Hoffa in the nineteen sixties, his whereabouts have remained one of this country's great unsolved mysteries. That is until just moments ago, when during a routine training session, a police dog named Hank sniffed his way right into the history books. As you can see behind us, the body is being carefully exhumed and will be transported to a hospital facility where DNA testing will confirm the identity. That, of course, only a formality as in a bizarre twist, the body was found buried with a birth certificate and complete set of dental records. Sort of a two-in-one for Hank today, as moments later, he busted a local news camera crew with four kilo's of marijuana. We see footage of PHIL AND HIS NEWS CREW, being cuffed on the ground, as large stacks of marijuana plants are being pulled from the van.Oh, Susan.. Hi.That's the word.No, thank you, I'm not hungry.No.I'm really not interested.Bobby, I--No, I really- no...No, Bobby.. Bobby N01 I said I didn't want anything. Damn you... Bruce continues off, as Bobby stops cold, adopts an odd expression, then his EYES ROLL UP IN THEIR SOCKETS, SPIN ALL THE WAR AROUND, THEN GLOW RED. LITTLE HORN BUMPS PUSH UP FROM HIS SKULL. He turns instantly demonic.No harm no foul, Jack. I needed some time off to reassess my goals and get in touch with my true self.Imagine what I can do with seven. Jack pauses for an awkward beat. His face grows serious.What's that?Oh, I'm busy doing...things. Jack recovers, rejuvenated.Jack, don't worry about that. Just give me a camera and a crew and I'll give you the news. Bruce exits. Jack likes the new Bruce. INT. NEWSROOM Bruce heads out as The Eyewitness News opening plays on several monitors. Susan Ortega opens.You know, he does have a certain pizazz about him.Hold that thought, Hazel! It seems some type of meteor or asteroid has, by chance, hit the earth right behind the Mark Twain Chili Cook Off. . .. . . So remember, it's sky diving season at Old Pete's airfield. This is Bruce Nolan.. My rip cord appears to be a bit stuck. Bruce yanks again harder, nothing, then again and the cord rips free from the suit.This is a very unfortunate turn of events. I'm heading toward the earth at a very precarious speed... The cameraman pops his shoot and we see Bruce continue to stream toward the ground below. He falls into a wooded area. A CAMERA ON THE GROUND picks up the coverage, runs through the brush with other BYSTANDERS to find Bruce laying on top of a BIG, HAIRY CREATURE.Ah ha! You are real! INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - DAYIn the past, zoo officials have been unable to get these Panda's to mate, but that doesn't seem to be a problem today. REVEAL A MALE PANDA wholeheartedly humping another PANDA.And the mood seems to be catching o. . . WIDE SHOT of the enclosure - PANDA'S are coupled off and humping everywhere. Mothers are frantically covering children's eyes, ushering them away from the exhibit. QUICK CUTS OF DIFFERENT NEWSCASTERS ON TV...and that's the way the cookie crumbles. EXT. FAIRGROUNDS - DAYVery good. If you run out just bring me some water, I'll take it from there. Grace looks over the menu as Bruce notices people at various tables eyeing him. He glances up to a ceiling light and REDIRECTS IT with his mind, so it SPOTLIGHTS HIM in golden light. TWO CUTE GIRLS with dates SMILE and wave. He waves back.Huh? Oh, no this is fine right here. Bruce looks at Grace lovingly. He takes her hand.I was going to wait until after the meal, but I think it's going to just bust out of me if I don't do it now. Grace beams, looks at Bruce with total love.You ready?I got anchor. Grace's face falls. She does her best to cover.Evidently, they're having problems with Evan. He's finishing up the week and I go live Monday.Well, yeah. Grace, I got anchor. We got anchor! She's having a hard time covering her let down.What's the matter?Yep, it's me. CUTE GIRL #1 Can we get a picture with you?Well, sure. Just one second, hun. Fans. We better get used to this, huh? Grace sits watching the two girls take turns sitting on Bruce's lap, taking pictures. Sees Bruce relishing in the attention. One girl gives Bruce a peck on the cheek and they r\"sS!w^w!s leave. Grace is clearly upset.Oh, thanks...Wow. It's kind of loud in here. Grace looks around the quiet romantic setting.Geez... ----- - COULD YOU ~KEEP TT DOWNl--- --WHAT? WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME FOR AIs this heaven? God laughs at this one.I'm dead?I God laughs.Those voices...Prayers? Those are prayers? Why can't I understand them?

Everything is great. A DOORWAY OPENS like a crack in space. Grace steps out, sees Bruce.Oh, ah, She can't... I just, ah, needed a little fresh air. Bruce fakes a couple big breaths.I wasn't running out on you...You are not helping. ...me at all here, Grace.Look hun, I want to talk about this. This just isn't a good time. Okay?Stay out of this. Grace looks at him like he's nuts.Oh, not now. Bruce puts his hands to his ears. Grace takes this as him not wanting to listen to her.Thank you.No. God smiles.Okay, first off, this creepy whisper thing has got to go. Organization and management. I need a system. Something concrete... * Prayer files 1 * * Let all prayers be organized into * +* files. * Bruce WAVES HIS HAND--- * Instantly, the room is JAMMED FULL OF FILE. CABINETS. * BRUCE * Too b ulky. Ah!

The office is * throwing me a party here, for getting anchor. Let's enjoy the ride for a whi le. We're just starting to have some fun.Grace.Hello... Corona. Lime next time?Bless you. Bless you.Put your money on the Sabers. Coach prays a lot. A FRENCH WAITER approaches Bruce.What do you have left? The Waiter holds up a small basket.Just take it around. The Waiter gets a confused look. CUT TO: CHIPS OVERFLOWING, SHRIMP SPILLING OUT OF BASKETS, HANDS REACHING GLUTTONOUSLY FOR THE BOUNTY.I ' d thank you all for coming, but the liquor is free so maybe you should THANK ME! Everyone laughs.And now let me tell you a story. There was a man who had two sons. The younger son took his inheritance and squandered his money on a life of lust and debauchery. I LOVE THAT GUY!!Oh, ah, I was calling Grace.I don't know, we had a fight earlier. Ever since I . . Well, things are different now and...Really?Look Susan, I don't know, I-- Susan grabs Bruce, kisses him passionately. Bruce doesn't join in, but doesn't fight it either. ANGLE - THE FRONT DOORGrace, I...Grace, wait. Grace follows Debbie out. EXT. UPSCALE HOME - NIGHT Bruce follows Grace outside.Grace, come on. Grace stops, opens her purse, tosses the keys to her new car in Bruce's chest.Come on, don't say that. I was just calling y ou--I didn't think you were coming-- I mean, I . . . I screwed up, okay. Let me make it up to you.If that's what you want.Grace, come on, don't do this.You're the one that didn't like the new place! Grace gets in, slams the door.You can't walk out on me! I'm the alpha, lady! I'm the Omega! Debbie peels out.I could make you stay! Bruce is left alone in the middle of the street.Fine! I don't need you! I have everything I need. Did you hear that?! I have EVERYTHING!Grace left me.She'll take me back. Will she take me back?How do you make someone love you when you can't effect free will?Okay, surrender, surrender. He walks over to Grace.Hi.I, ah, have my first anchor tonight.I miss you. I just took the first step, shot myself out on the ledge, awaiting vulnerably your response.How about you love me and you'll take me back.Come on, what about all the signs?Would it help if I told you I acted like an ass? Martin is standing nearby.It's okay as long as you mean a donkey. I didn't add \"hole.\" It's only bad when you say \"ass-ho--Grace, please. None of this seems * right without you. * * Is that a glimmer of hope I see? *Wait. Bruce DRAMATICALLY RAISES A HAND TOWARD GRACE, like putting a love spell on her.Now how do you feel? She looks at him, oddly.Drin kin g? Sur e. I'm dru nk wit hHey11 That's my car!! INT. BRUCE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS The PRISONERS drive off laughing. PRISONER #1 Ha, nice wheels, huh?

I love the hair net. How'd you get it to do that?Oh, my gosh, look at this one. My sister is so drunk. She places it in the album.Aren't you taking this a little too seriously?I'm sorry. Bruce collapses into Grace's arms like a child. He clearly has a fragile temperament.It does matter. You're funny. You make people smile. Come on, take a break, help me put this album together.Oh look at this. It's the first day we moved in together. It's the two of them, younger, laughing.Oh, here's me at my sister's wedding. I caught the bouquet. It's a picture of Grace overpowering the other bridesmaids for the bouquet.Well, I was thinking about you. Grace cuddles into Bruce.You have no idea.Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles. They kiss, stumbling toward the bedroom.Oh, say it again.Oh, I just love on-air personalities.Sweety, time to get up... She kisses Bruce, gets up.I'm in the shower!Wow, nice car, huh?We're having a blood drive.Oh, that's a nice response.Helpful and life saving?They do not. Now stop it. I'm * giving.

Her youngest, ZOE, 3, runs over to greet her.They didn't teach you Spanish in nursing school, did they?Martin has decided to explore new food groups. Martin, this is for art. Like this. She spreads paste on the paper, sprinkles glitter.D eb -- Ma rt i n! Martin is busted with the paste spreader stuck in his mouth. Grace snatches it.Okay, go rinse your mouth with water. Lave su boca. Go. I swear that kid is going to poop an ornament.Don't start...Debbie, don't call me that.Saved by the bell. Grab that for me, will you? Debbie does.Hey. Grace GRABS THE PHONE.Sorry, honey.

This isn't his fault.Honey, you're mad right now. It's understandable. And what Evan did was slimy and wrong. But your job doesn't matter to me. You matter to me. You could've really been hurt. I'm just glad you're okay.Is that what you have, Bruce? A mediocre life?

Oh my... * CUT TO: *Good morning. Cooked you grilled cheese.Last night was just...Mmm hmm. Bruce enjoys his grilled cheese.It's funny, but when I woke up this morning, It felt like my boobs were bigger. Bruce looks away, guilty, trying to be nonchalant.Do they look bigger to you?They're definitely bigger. They feel huge to me. Bruce throws up his hands.Where are you going? He stops, turns. A new confident Bruce.Do you believe how they're playing? Oh, honey, would you hand me the scissors? Bruce diverts his attention, when the Sabers screw up and the crowd GROANS. Bruce immediately turns, looks intently at the puck and GOAL, SABERS! THE CROWD ROARS! INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNINGI guess. I feel like a human taquito.And he's taking me out tonight to dinner at Chez L'Amour.Afraid so. Debbie eyes Margarita.So, Bruce said and I quote: \"Prepare yourself for an amazing evening that will change our lives forever.\" Margarita reaches Debbie's waist and YANKS tightly.I don't think anything.Well, he's always said when he gets his career together, you know... And his career is more than together. I mean, come on, Chez L'Amour. Change our lives...Well, he just might surprise you.Should we ask for a more private table?I think so.That's great, honey. Congratulations. Wow. So that's what's tonight is about?Well, to be honest, I thought that maybe tonight, you-- The TWO CUTE GIRLS interrupt, approach Bruce.You have lipstick on your face.Bruce, we need to talk. I thought we had an understanding-- Suddenly, the WHISPERS start again. Bruce looks around, figures it's coming from the restaurant patrons.What are you talking about? It's not loud. The WHISPERS GROW IN VOLUME.Bruce, this isn't funny.Bruce? What are you doing out here? With that, the terrain TRANSFORMS back into the alley where Grace has been standing all along. She can not see .God.Bruce, what is going on? The second I want to talk about us you run out on me.You know, I actually had the crazy idea that you were going to ask me to marry you tonight.Not helping you what?When is it a good time? It's never a good time.Who are you talking to?! Just then, the WHISPERS start in again. Bruce reacts.Fin e. Yo u kn ow wh at? I 'm go in g t o go home and if by some miracle it * suddenly becomes a 'good time', you * know where to find me. * * And speaking of time, you're * running out of it. * Grace heads back into the restaurant. Bruce stands completely frustrated.Okay, this is getting ridiculous I Grace's boobs are enormous! A healthy D-cup.I have to see a doctor. There's definitely something wrong with me. Bruce jumps up from the computer, hides what he's doing...I look like a hooker I My whole body is changing. She turns profile, her back sways causing her ass to stick out.My back didn't used to arch like this. Bruce gets up, walks to Grace.Bruce, I feel like our relationship is becoming all about sex.No, Bruce. Come on. * She breaks away and sees the computer is on. * GRACE * What's that? What are you doing? * Bruce tries to cover. * BRUCE * Oh, ah. Nothing. Surfing the * internet...for stories... GRACE * Is this why you didn't come to bed? * BRUCE * No, ah...Honey, you're going to be * late.No, I'm not. Bruce looks over Grace's shoulder and ADJUSTS THE CLOCK FORTY MINUTES FORWARD. Grace turns and is surprised.Oh my goshI How did I sleep this late? I've got to run. Are you giving me a ride?y ou' re c ra zy . Ca n we a ff ord t ha t?L ook! I'm back to no rmal. It was the wildest thing, I was worried, so I said a prayer and the next thing I know, I was completely healed. It was like a miracle.So, you're taking me to lunch? Th is i s ra re -- But wonderful.Oh, you'll never believe it. Debbie won the lotteryIBut get this, there were like 433 thousand other winners, so it only paid out 17 dollars. Can you believe the odds of that? EXT., UPSCALE HOME - DAYWhat is this? EXT. UPSCALE HOME - DAY *What?This had to cost-- I can't even imagine how much this had to cost.Wh-What am I missing here? You can't afford this. You're a reporter. Buying cars is one t hing, but this-- Bruce grabs a hold of Grace.There's only one problem.I hate it. Bruce is surprised.What were you thinking? Why didn't * you talk to me about this? * BRUCE * I wanted to surprise you. * GRACE * Mission accomplished. *Appreciative of what? The fact that you didn't include me on a major life decision or that we now live in the Sultan of Bernai's * house? *What is that supposed to mean?What is happening to you? You're changing.Yeah, and so would their pimps. * BRUCE * I can't believe this. I did all * this for us. * GRACE * Us ? W hat us? Yo u a lwa ys said wh en * your career takes off we'd get * married. What happened to that us? *Not a great time. What is that, your mantra? This is never going to change. . . Grace heads down the stairs. *No, you're just starting to have fun. Suddenly, the TOILET FLUSHES off camera. Grace sees Sam in the bathroom spraying some deodorizer before he exits.And what in God's name is going on with that dogI? Grace pulls her cell phone .out of her purse, heads for the door.I'm going to have Debbie pick me up.I'm sorry, but I won't be attending your little pa rty tomorrow. And if * you would like to see me after I will be at our home. *Oh, and that poor, struggling guy you talked about? I miss him. ON BRUCE - BUMMEDCozy, don't you think? Come on help me find him. They head into the room.I don't know. It's his big night. * I don't want to spoil it. I know . * how much this means to him. * DEBBIE * So much for lashing back... Grace stops dead in her tracks. Her face drops. GRACE'S POV - BRUCE, still lip-locked with Susan Ortega.. Get the car, Deb.Here. I do n't w ant your car. I don't want your things. . . I don't want you.And you thought Susan's mouth was the phone?How about a boat, Bruce?Yeah, a big boat and oh, maybe two bags of cash, you know, the ones with the big cartoon dollar signs on the front. Then I'll be happy. Because I'm just hollow inside. Debbie's been right. All this time. I defended you, told her there was good in you. Another side to you. Well, I just saw that other side and I don't want anything to do with it. Debbie pulls up, Grace storms off to the car. Bruce follows,Go back to your little co-anchor. Or is that ho-anchor? I came back here to apologize. How stupid am I? Grace turns and heads to the car.Hi..That's great. I hope it goes well for you. He's hit in the head by a ball. Grace can't help but smiles Bruce leaps at the opportunity.. . . I don't know what to say.No, Bruce.What? How do you know about that? Did you talk to Debbie?Alright, inside, Martin.

The FALLS ROAR behind him and the Mate of the Mist sightseeing boat is in the b.g.No, it's Debbie. The sister who's life you're not wasting.What?Yeah, she should marry somebody famous, take the focus off. Grace checks her cell phone screen.We would have heard it ring.He just needs to blow off some steam, he'll be fine.Wow, you lashed? You never lash. I'm impressed.Well, I've been praying to win the lottery for fifteen years, but it's not going to happen. You know, it's not all about money. The CLERK finishes ringing the last item.What?! Debbie looks in a bag, pulls out a handful of various counter items. Zoe giggles and proudly holds up one of the hundred or so Tic-Tac mint containers.Zoe.Hey, everybody back-off i Zoe laughs, enjoying the commotion.You're a saint, Grace.So this is what success buys you.Well, thank Mr. Exclusive for me. He's on a quite a roll. What'd he do make a deal with the devil?Well, la-ti-da. Mike's idea of a romantic evening is Chez Sizzler. Margarita pulls the wrap tightly around Debbie.What does this do again?Grasa? Doesn't that mean fat?Good - you wouldn't want to leave any spare oxygen in there. Wait a second, you don't think he's going to propose, do you?You do. You think he's going to propose.I don't know, hun. I mean, I like Bruce but that man's priority list is him, him, him, then him some more and then you.That's what I'm worried about. Careful, you missed a spot of free flowing circulation. Margarita senses the attitude and pulls tighter. Debbie reacts.That'd do it. Margarita motions for Debbie to lay down and leaves. Debbie struggles to lay down.Let's see, how do I-- Debbie slides to the ground, Grace cracks up, gets up to help, but also in mummy wrap, topples on top of her. They both laugh and struggling to get up. Hearing the ruckus, Margarita enters and gasps.Hey, I'll take that over fat...

Bruce backs away from God.Well, that's not very neighborly. I brought you here to offer you a job.My job. You think you can do it better, so here's your chance. When you leave this building you will be endowed with all my powers.All the power of God. Bruce glances back at the empty desk, turns back again and God the Janitor has also vanished.

Off Bruce's look.Okay, let me explain the rules.Yeah, you left in such a rush I didn't get a chance to explain.I figured that would get your attention.. I did the same thing to Ghandi, he couldn't eat for three weeks. Now, here's the deal. You have all my power. Use it any way you choose. There are only two rules. You can't tell anyone you're God. Believe me you don't want that kind of attention. And you can't mess with free will.Yes you can. That's the beauty it. Suddenly a LARGE SAILBOAT SAIL PASSES RIGHT BY THEM.
