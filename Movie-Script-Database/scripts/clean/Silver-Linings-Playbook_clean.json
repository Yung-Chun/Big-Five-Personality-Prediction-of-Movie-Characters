{"Silver-Linings-Playbook": {"PAT": {"raw_line": "What, are you kidding me? Sundays? I love Sundays. I live for Sundays. The whole family's together. Mom makes braciole. Dad puts the jersey on. We're all watching the game. Yeah, it drives me crazy, and yes, I was negative.You didn't even know that I loved it, Nikki, but I did. I just didn't appreciate it, or you, before.\" There is a knock at the door.I lost all that. I blew it. But you also blew it. We can get it back. We're gonna get it back. It's all gonna be better now. I'm better now and I hope you are, too. And I'mHey, I'll be there in a minute, okay?I'll be there in a minute. Pat returns to his speech.That's true love. See glimpses of Pat's room: mayonnaise jar filled with water, black trash bag strewn on the bed, handwritten sign taped to Pat's wall, \"EXCELSIOR\".Once you get in the right frame of mind, I think anything's possible. I think we get, we so often get caught in this state of negativity and it's a, it's a poison like nothing else.Hey, Mom. Can we give Danny a ride to North Philly?Mom, no, it'll be fine. It'll be fine.Danny was in for assault because of crystal meth and alcohol.Yeah. On top of an anxiety disorder.It's good now.All right, Mom, just hold on a sec.Mom, just listen--I'm sorry, Mom. You okay?Mom, can we stop at the library? I wanna read Nikki's entire English high school syllabus.Mom, it's a good thing. I'm remaking myself.Mm-hmm.It's right here.You still got yours?You didn't tell Dad you were picking me up?Yeah, and the court said--Dad, relax. The court said it's fine, okay? Let it go.Dad, I'm in there because of the court. That's the agreement that we made months ago. It was a plea bargain with the courts. The lawyer, he instructed me, he said that what we should plead that, and then I would serve eight months and then I'd get out.Thank you. So what are you doing with yourself?How you gonna pay for it?From your bookmaking?Mom told me. Outside.You just told me outside, Mom, what are you talking about? Five minutes ago, we were walking up the stairs, you said, \"Don't say anything, but Dad lost his job and he's bookmaking.\"Good, Dad. Good.What am I gonna do? I'm getting in shape, I'm getting trim, I'm getting really fit for Nikki. I'm gonna read Nikki's teaching syllabus and get my old job back.Let me tell you something. You don't know anything about my marriage, okay, Dad? All right? Our marriage...we're very, very much in love, okay? Just like you two.What are you doing, Dad? You know what? Excelsior. Excelsior.It means you know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna take all this negativity and use it as fuel and I'm gonna find a silver lining, that's what I'm gonna do. And that's no bullshit. That's no bullshit. That takes work and that's the truth.What the fuck?!...and he does. He does. He survives the war, after getting blown up he survives it, and he escapes to Switzerland with Catherine. But now Catherine's pregnant. Isn't that wonderful? She's pregnant. And they escape up into the mountains and they're gonna be happy, and they're gonna be drinking wine and they dance -- they both like to dance with each other, there's scenes of them dancing, which was boring, but I liked it, because they were happy. You think he ends it there? No! He writes another ending. She dies, Dad! I mean, the world's hard enough as it is, guys. It's fucking hard enough as it is. Can't somebody say, \"Hey, let's be positive? Let's have a good ending to the story?\"Mom, for what, I can't apologize. I'm not gonna apologize for this. You know what I will do? I will apologize on behalf of Ernest Hemingway, because that's who's to blame here.I was reading.I'm gonna go run now.I'll fix it when I get back.I don't wanna go to therapy.Is that song really playing?That song is killing me. Could you please turn it off?What do you mean, you can't?Is, is the speaker here?I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay...I'm sorry. I'll fix all this, okay?That was a messed up thing you did, Doctor Patel. That's a messed up thing. I'm sorry, but that's....Yeah, well, Cliff, that's not the way you're supposed to meet people, okay? Why don't you write that down in your, I don't know, your little book you write stuff down in.Bravo. It's a trigger. I'm not gonna take any meds, I should just tell you that right now.No, I'm not gonna take any medicine. It makes me foggy--I don't want any meds, Doctor. Look, I am not the explosion guy, okay? My father is the explosion guy. I'm not that guy. He got kicked out of that stadium he beat up so many people at Eagles games, he's on the exclusion list. I had one incident.But I'm ready. I'm ready to take responsibility for my side of the street. She just needs to take responsibility for hers.What's hers? Are you joking? Let's go back to the incident. I come home from work after I...principal. I come home and what's playing but the song from my wedding. The song that you so charmingly played out here today for us. That's playing and I don't think anything of it. Which is odd, `cause I should have....ll of a sudden I see the DVD player, and on the D-......panties on the ground and then-...and I think, \"Oh, that's kinda sweet, she's in the shower. What a perfect thing. I'm gonna find her and maybe I'll go in there. We never-......pull the curtain back and there's the fucking history...And you know what he says to me?So yeah, I snapped. I almost beat him to death. But now I get fucking chastised for it? I'm parallel to my father? I don't think so.Yeah, about a week before the incident, I called the cops and I told them that my wife and the history guy were plotting against me by embezzling money from the local high school, which wasn't true. It was a delusion. And we later found out from the hospital that's because I'm, uh...Yeah. With mood swings and weird thinking brought on by severe stress, which rarely happens, thank God. And then the shower incident happened and that's when everything snapped, so I then realized that, oh, wow, I've been dealing with this my whole life. And without any supervision I've been doing it all on my own with no help and basically I've been white-knuckling it this whole time.Yeah. It's a lot to deal with, especially when you don't know what the hell is happening, which I do now. Sort of.I can't, Mom. I can't.Why would you do that? You wouldn't do that. Why would you call them?I don't, I don't feel good when I'm on them, Mom. I don't feel good. I'm so much clearer without them. Mom, they make me bloated. I don't like the way it makes me look.Come on, I'm doing it with my physicality. I've been workin' out, that's what I'm doin'.To sweat.I don't believe in juju, Dad.All right, all right.For a second. I'll watch the beginning of the game.What's that in your hand?Handkerchief?That's OCD. That's crazy.I'm the reason? I don't think so.Mom.Who's that? That's not Rick D'Angelo, is it?Is he the guy who's having the problem?No, you shut the door in his face. I'm going for a run.Ms. Meckers!Nance! This is my lucky day! Look at you working on a Sunday!How are you? Hey.I just came by to say hi, to let you know I'm ready to come back to work.I'll work full-time, half-time. I'll sub, I'll work history, whatever you want.Here, let me give you a hand. I'm sorry. I'm being rude.Let me ask you something. Let me just ask you something. Does Nikki still work here?Why would you tell me that? You know he broke up my marriage. What, are you being, a troublemaker?I did, yeah. I did. Thank you.I'm better. I just want to let you know, I'm better now. Okay? I'm better. I feel good. I feel so good. Look at my eyes. Look at my eyes. Look at how clear they are.I'm not a complainer anymore. I'm a positive guy. Okay?Yes.Yes! It will be!I'm gonna take that as a silver development, Nancy! A silver development! That's a silver lining!Ronnie! Pat.Hey.Thank you.Yeah, I'm out.Uh-huh.Thank you.Congratulations on the baby, but I'm not buying the invitation.I know Veronica still hates me.Yes, it is. Nikki always said that \"Ronnie's wife keeps his social calendar where she keeps his balls, in her purse.\"Sure.Now, you guys are still in touch with Nikki, right? Does Veronica still talk to Nikki?I have very, good news, everybody. Very good news.Things are looking up.You know what, I knew why they invited me over. I knew it.Oh, no way!No way, Dad. You mean, Doug Culpepper?Wait just a minute.What are you doing?Give me the phone. Dad, this is my life. Dad.Yeah.Yeah, Dad, I know.Since when do cops have cards?Nikki's waiting for me to get in shape and get my life in order, and then she's gonna be with me. And that's better than any medication.Let me say something, I gotta say something.This is what I believe to be true. This is what I learned in the hospital. You have to do everything you can, you have to work your hardest, and if you do, if you stay positive, you have a shot at a silver lining.Hey, my friend Ronnie's having this party on Sunday night and it's like a real hoity-toity thing and his wife, Veronica's a real stickler for.... I don't know, my mom got this Gap outfit she wants me to wear, but I wanna wear a jersey that my brother, Jake, got me from the Eagles.DeSean Jackson.Well, that settles that.I gotta go, man.I can't stay, come on. I made a mistake, I shouldn't have worn this.I feel like an idiot.Veronica's not gonna like it.Plus you got a tie on.Really?Hey.Wow!Tremendous. Tremendous.Tremendous.Why?Gotta be making a lot of paper to do that.Isn't the market down, though?Hey, you know my dad lost his pension.Yeah.Really?You okay?Holy shit.Who told you you can't be happy?That's not true at all.Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie!Who?Tiffany and...Tommy?What happened to Tommy?Tommy died?How'd he die?No, how did he die?You look nice.I'm not flirting with you.I just see that you made an effort and I'm gonna be better with my wife, I'm working on that. I wanna acknowledge her beauty. I never used to do that. I do that now. `Cause we're gonna be better than ever...Nikki. Just practicing. How'd Tommy die?What about your job?Oh, really? How?I mean, I'm sorry. How'd that happen?Oh, it's a television.It's a brick oven, it's a brick oven.Where would the dead body...where would the body go, though? `Cause the outside of the--Well, I don't have an iPod. I don't even have a phone. They won't let me make any calls. They think I'm gonna call Nikki.I would call Nikki.Can you play \"Ride the Lightning\" by Metallica?Here's a fun fact. You know where the term \"OK\" comes from?Well, Martin Van Buren, the eighth president of the United States of America, is from Kinderhook, New York......and he was part of a club, a men's club, called Old Kinderhook. And if you were cool, you were in the club, they'd say, \"That guy's OK.\" `Cause he was in the Old Kinderhooks.Yeah. Pretty cool, right?Oh, really? My wife loves dance. Nikki loves dance.Wow, wow, wow. Fascinating.Me? None. I used to be on Lithium and Seroquel and Abilify, but I don't take them anymore, no. They make me foggy and they also make me bloated.You ever take Klonopin?Right?It's like, \"What? What day is it?\" How about Trazodone?Oh, it flattens you out. I mean, you are done. It takes the light right out of your eyes.You mean me?You have poor social skills. You have a problem.I tell the truth. But you're mean.How what works?How old are you?Look, I had a really good time tonight and I think you're really pretty, but I'm married, okay?No, that's confusing. He's dead.Wait, what?What's happening?Oh, my God. Hey.I don't know, Mom.When am I gonna get a phone?I looked in here, but this is all your sewing shit up here, for your sewing and everything. Did you put it up here?Dad, not now!Would you put it in here? It makes no sense for you to put it in here.He's got all his Eagles videos and not one video of my wedding!Is it here? I mean....?It feels to me like you wanna hide my wedding video.I'm not yelling, Mom, I'm just frustrated because I should have my fucking wedding video!I want it! It-...It's my wedding! It's my wedding video!Mom?Mom?No, no, no, no, no!Get off me, Dad!Nikki is being manipulated and controlled. You have to talk to her.What explosion? No. Cliff is lying, that's not true. He's not allowed to talk about that.You can't tell Nikki about this, Officer.No, no! No!No, no, no, listen, sir.I'm sorry. I could just write you a letter and you could just let me have five minutes, explaining how much better I'm doing....this is not a reflection of where I'm at. You can't...please, you can't tell her any of this You can't tell Nikki about this.Who was that, Dad?Come on, don't write it up! I don't want her to see this!Weight lifting accident.Hey, this is my route, okay? Just back off.I like to run by myself, okay?Hey, I like to run alone! Will you stop?Okay? I'm running here!Well then, why don't you run somewhere else? There's a fucking ton of roads to run in! What are you trying to do?What the fuck?!I'm married!What the fuck are you doing? Your husband's dead!You're crazy!I'm not the big slut!Let me just set the record straight about last night. Hurting my mother was a mistake and I hate myself for it, and I hate my illness and I want to control it. My father, on the other hand, had no trouble slapping the shit out of me last night, which I did not return `cause I could've killed him and I didn't. He's sixty-five years old. You don't think I could've beat the shit out of him? I mean....Yes, last night was a mess. Okay? And I think he probably just tried to do his best.Yeah, but that's easier said than done.Yeah, Excelsior. Listen, I have a letter I want you to give Nikki, okay?Why?Oh, I don't know, because I'm married and I haven't seen my wife in eight and a half months?Not bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki because Tiffany's a slut.After the dinner at Ronnie's, she said, quote, \"We can go to the back house and you can fuck me as long as we turn the lights out.\" Unquote. And she still wears her wedding ring. So she's a loyal, married-to-a-dead-guy slut.She said she's not a whore anymore, but she likes that part of herself along with all the other parts of herself and can I say the same?Is that....? You're asking me, you're really asking me that question?With all my crazy sad shit? What, are you fucking nuts?No, not the books.How do you know when I run?No, I'm not giving you a hard time.Happy Halloween.I'm gonna have a bowl of your Raisin Bran.You look nice.You want to share this?Why did you order tea?I ordered Raisin Bran because I didn't want there to be any mistaking this for a date.It's not a date. So how's your thing going -- your dancing thing?I wouldn't actually call the restraining order \"my thing,\" but getting back with Nikki is, and I've been doing pretty well. Except for a minor incident at the doctor's office.Yeah. That was a thing with my parents. I wish I could just explain it all in a letter to Nikki because it was minor and I could just explain it and let her know that I'm actually not out of control and that I'm actually doing really well.It would be so amazing if you could get a letter to Nikki from me.But you would do it?How did you lose your job?Everybody?We don't have to talk about it.How many were there?Wow.I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.Can I ask you one more question? Were there any women?Really?What was that like?Jesus Christ. Was it like...older women, a sexy teacher who wants toWhat? You sat on her lap?She told you what to do?Oh...my God. Nikki hated when I talked like this. Made me feel like such a pervert. Maybe we should change the subject.You don't, do you.I get it. The song that was playing when my wife...was in the shower with the history teacher......it was my wedding song and when I hear it, I go kinda crazy. Sometimes I hear it when it's not even playing.Yeah. So they put me on medication, which I feel ashamed of.So I know.I just gotta get a strategy, you know?We'd better get back to the letter.What if you told Nikki when Veronica was in the bathroom?Oh, my God, I'm gonna go home and write the letter right now.Wait, what?Wait a minute. Did Veronica tell Nikki about our dinner? Why would she do that? Was it a test?Goddamn it. I knew it. It was a test. How did I do? I think I did pretty well.\"Basically\"? Was I some percentage not cool?No, I don't know.What do you mean? How am I? What does that mean?\"Sort of like you\"? I hope to God she didn't tell Nikki that.Because, it's just not right, lumping you and I together, I mean, it's just wrong. And Nikki wouldn't like that. Especially after all the shit you just told me.Keep your voice down.Shut the fuck up.Tiffany! Hey! Tiffany!Hey, come on. Look, I don't think you're crazy, all right?No, I don't.What? Hey, calm down! Hey--Can I just explain myself, please? I didn't want Nikki to think that I was associated with that kind of sexual behavior because I've never done anything like that, okay?Hey, hey!Shut up!Bro, get off of me.Hey, hey, stop, stop. Stop, all right?Hey, get off of me! Shut up, shut up.Stop it.Hey, hey, hey, get off me!I didn't, I didn't, I didn't-- TIFFANY WATCHES IN THE CROWD OF HALLOWEEN TEENS. Softens.I'm sorry.I'm sorry.She doesn't, she doesn't do that anymore.I'm sorry about what I said in the diner.I didn't mean it at all.All the time.Wow. I really appreciate that, Tiffany.You do?I'll see you tomorrow? With the letter?Dad, I borrowed one of your envelopes. I hope that's not aYeah, I know. I saw two-seven-four. I just wanted to tell you the number.But the envelope was empty. I'm sorry, you were sleeping. I didn't want to wake you, but I needed an envelope.Yeah, come on, Dad, be nice. Come on, she's making crabby snacks and homemades. Come on, Dad!I'm happy.Isn't that a good thing?Am I taking the right dose? Of course I am.No, if I was taking that, I'd be on the floor, Dad.Dad, I can't. Look, I'm ready to go.Wait, you mean OCD, superstitious time?I can't.Nothing, come on.Guys, I'm beating the song! I'm on the scoreboard! I'm playing down field! I feel great!Tiffany!Hey, how you doin'? Is Tiffany here?Whoa, no, no, no. No, I'm married.I'm her friend.We go running. Have you guys not seen us? I took her to the diner.What are you doing here?Do you know this guy?Listen to what he's saying. Listen to what he's saying.He's saying you're being rude.Oh, you know. You know. Come on. Sometimes it's okay with girls like this, they wanna have fun and--it's not because they got a broken wing, and they're hurt, and they're an easy target. And in this case, in this particular case, I think that wing is being fixed.And you gotta make sure it gets mended. And you're gettin' in the way of that right now, okay? Because she's sensitive and she's smart, she's artistic. This is a great girl and you gotta be respectful of that. Come on.Let me walk you down to your car. You're a better guy than this. I can see it in your eyes.Hey! Hey, wait a second! What are you doing? What happened? How come you weren't outside? What the hell's going on?What do you mean, you can't do it? You can't do what?Tiffany, what are you talking about? What do you mean you can't give the letter to Nikki?You said! You said if I wrote a letter, you'd get it to Nikki.That was the set-up.What are you talking about? You seem like you're a tough girl to me. Why don't you just do things on your own?Alright, well, ask for you. What can I do for you?Tiffany, what do you want me to do?Think of something.There's a thing, okay. What kind of thing?It's a dance thing, all right.Well, Tommy's dead, so he's not gonna fucking do it.I don't have a filter when I talk.Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm not gonna fuckin' dance with you. What are you talking about?Tiffany, I'm not gonna do a dance with you.Wait a second! But you promised you would do this.Well, I already did do something for you, you know.I took care of that jerkoff that was in front of your house.Let me ask you something. Do you call him when you're lonely?That encourages him, Tiffany. You shouldn't do it.It's not at all like me and Nikki. What are you talking about? We're in love and we're married. It's completely different.We have a very unconventional chemistry, it makes people feel awkward, but not me. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever been with.It's electric between us, okay? Yeah, we wanna change each other, but that's normal, couples wanna do that, I want her to stop dressing like she dresses, I want her to stop acting so superior to me, okay? And she wanted me to lose weight and stop my mood swings, both of which I've done. I mean, people fight. Couples fight. We would fight, we wouldn't talk for a couple weeks. That's normal. She always wanted the best for me. Tiffany listens.She wanted me to be passionate and compassionate. And that's a good thing. You know? I just, look, I'm my best self today, and I think she's her best self today, and our love's gonna be fucking amazing.Danny, you're out of the hospital? And you're here on game day?I never understand what he's saying.Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dad's got you sitting here?And now you're holding the remote?And Danny's the good luck charm?Superstition, Danny. I don't know.Dad, Dad, Dad. She's my friend. Why would you say that?I go to a lot of therapy, Ronnie. What are you trying to say?Why don't you stop judging people? You judge everybody. You're the one who has a messed up marriage.You should have seen when I was at his house. It's like a circus over there.What are you talking about? I'm not gonna hide this. You need to deal with it.Oh!!!!Whoa! Is this for me?How many songs is that?Oh, yeah, you got The Stranglers. You love The Stranglers. Oh, the Sex Pistols. The Clash.Oh, \"West Side Story.\"Right, right, right.You gotta get your marriage together.Ronnie, that's fucked up.When I'm with Nikki, I'm never gonna do stuff like that...How you doing, Jake?As my friend Danny would say 00 The room hangs on Pat's words.I got nothing but love for you, brother.DeSean Jackson.I wore it to Ronnie's for dinner.Veronica didn't like it.I'm not doing anything!People like Tiffany, or Danny, or me, maybe we know something that you guys don't know, okay? Did you ever think about that? Maybe we understand something because we'reJesus.What? No, no, he passed his thing, right?Wow.Where do you sleep?When are you gonna give it to her?The letter to Nikki.Really?Oh, I actually changed the first paragraph. I did this thing about Shakespeare and how it's very-and that maybe in the future if she wanted to go dancing, I can be able to do that because of all theI assume you're a good teacher.Maybe you can teach us both, you know what I mean?And I also mentioned how generous it is, what I'm doing for you.You know, being of service.To your need.Can we do something else besides the dance deal?I'm good with a hammer. You want me to fix something?I know. Okay. I was just suggesting that maybe there's a better scenario.I'm not doing it.No. That's stupid.You're not Nikki.I don't feel anything.No.What?He wants me to have--all this Eagles information.Um, tell Dad thanks.Wait, wait, no, no, no, what are you doing? I'm behind on my syllabus.What the hell are you doing?Hey, hey!Did you just throw that outside?Wow. That was a great synopsis. I still need to read it, though.Who's that?What the....? What are you doing here, man?How'd you know we were here?Danny, this is Tiffany. Tiffany, this is Danny.Yeah.Whoa, whoa, that's enough.Yeah, anything you wanna know, I'll just tell you. It was nothing. It was just a very general letter.She is my friend with an \"F.\"For \"friend.\" The three stand there awkwardly for a beat.Yeah.Why? What is it, what is it, what is it.Just say it. Say it.Okay.Okay, we got it, we got it.\"Black it up\"?Yeah, go see Tanya. Good idea.Excelsior!I didn't realize that.Okay.Right.Is that true?Yeah.You want me to go to the game with Jake?He told you that?Even with all his friends?He's not embarrassed?I made a commitment to Tiffany about a project, and we have a very important part of it that we have to go over on Sunday, and it's good for me, Dad. It's making me disciplined and focused, and it's, it's--, I never would've thought this, but it's a good thing.It's a dance thing, okay? There's nothing more to it, Dad. I swear.Listen, I need to ask you something.Tomorrow can I spend half the day with you and half the day at the Eagles game?Why?I know, but my dad opened up to me and it was really beautiful and I wanna be of service to him, okay? And he's worried that the juju from the Eagles is being fucked up and he's concerned that it's because I'm spending time with you.No, you're not messing up the juju, but the juju is messed up because I'm not with him during the games.What?Tiff, I'm sorry. I can't do anything else without reading Nikki's letter, okay? It's just--, it's in the back of my head. We don't almost have it, all right?Thank you.What was her energy when she gave it to you?She was scared? About what? Did she tell you?I'm just gonna read it out loud, okay? Because if she says anything that's, you know, is that too much to ask?Okay. Sorry.\"Dear Pat, It was very emotional for me to get your letter, as I'm sure you can imagine, but I'm glad you took the risk of discreetly getting it to me through Tiffany. This gives us a chance to communicate while I keep the restraining order until I feel safe. I must admit you sound terrific and I'm happy that you are feeling so positive and becoming a more loving and caring man, which I always knew you were. I was moved to read about `Excelsior' and your belief in happy endings. I am also moved by your act of love to read the books I have taught at the high school. I'm sorry you find them so negative, but I disagree. I think they are great works of art that reflect how hard life can be and they can also help kids prepare themselves for the hardness of life. In spite of all these positive developments, Pat, I have to say if it's me reading the signs, I need to see something to prove you are ready to resume our marriage. Otherwise I find myself thinking that we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately. Please don't react quickly to this, but take time to think about it. I'm glad you're doing so well. Love, Nikki.\" PAT FOLDS UP THE LETTER AGAIN. He is kind of crying.I think I'm done for today, okay?Thanks for the letter. I'll see you tomorrow, okay?Can I use your phone?Yeah, kind of.Well, I'm just doing this project with Tiffany and I wanted to tell her I'm not gonna be on time.She's not crazy -- I'll just borrow Jake's phone. It's too bad you can't come in to the stadium, but I know you were kicked out, you know, for beating everybody up. Guess we're not that different, huh, Dad?No, I think, it's a good thing.Yeah. I'm solid.Hey, how you doing?It's alright.No!Doctor Patel!Hey! What are you doing here?I'm not supposed to be seeing you, right? Outside the office?That's illegal!Hey, Jake this is Cliff. This is my doctor, Cliff.Why don't you wanna talk to Veronica?You have to change. You're not gonna throw the marriage away. There's some kind of love there. I know, I used to see it.You guys have a beautiful thing that got broken somewhere along the line and you gotta fix it like a chiropractor. You gotta give it a chiropractic adjustment.Enough with awkwardness! I don't wanna walk in your house and not be able to say what I wanna say.What, what's wrong?I'm not gonna go anywhere.I'm not gonna fight. I'm not gonna fight.Dad.I am solid. I was solid at the game, Dad. I'm solid, I'm solid now.No, Dad!No, Dad, Dad, Dad, don't!No, Dad! I didn't do a fucking thing! Come on, Dad!Wait a second, I tried to call, my God, what's happening, I called--, but I tried to call you, Tiffany,Yes.I told you I was gonna split my time with my dad and you, and my dad was pulling me in one direction.

you were.I just got fired, actually.Does it really matter?It's a computer screen.It's a light. It's a......it's a drawer at a morgue where they pull out dead bodies and shoot them with formaldehyde.In the middle of the wall?Of all the rooms there are iPod ports in, I'm happy you brought us into the bathroom.Why do you have to talk about me like that?Don't talk about me in the third person.I'm right here.Sorry. I don't wanna be mean.Yeah, I was on Xanax and Effexor, but I agree, I wasn't as sharp, so I stopped.Klonopin? Yeah.Jesus.Trazodone!God, I bet it does.I'm tired. I wanna go.I said I'm tired. Are you gonna walk me home or what?Yeah, you. Are you gonna walk me home?I have a problem? You say more inappropriate things than appropriate things. You scare people.What? I'm not telling the truth? Veronica and Ronnie are very uncomfortable.Stop talking about me in third person.You love it when I have problems. You love it, Von, because then you can be the good one. Just say it.Oh, God.Nothing's my problem! I'm fine. I'm tired and I wanna go. Come on, are you ready? Pat stands.Yes, I really wanna go! It's been great.Sorry. I don't wanna wake up the baby. Bye.This is me.Listen, I haven't dated since before my marriage so I don't really remember how this works.I saw the way you were looking at me, Pat. You felt it, I felt it, don't lie. We're not liars like they are. I live in the addition around back, which is completely separate from my parents' house, so there's no chance of them walking in on us. I hate the fact that you wore a football jersey to dinner because I hate football, but you can fuck me if you turn the lights off, okay?Old enough to have a marriage end and not wind up in a mental hospital.You're married? So am I.What happened to your face?That sounds like bullshit. Why'd you run by my house? Did our little conversation get you upset last night?This is my neighborhood. You just ran by my house.Me too.What?Me too!I like this road. This is my neighborhood.Calm down, crazy.Hey!So am I!Where is your wife?I'm not the one that just got out of that hospital in Baltimore.I was a big slut, but I'm not anymore. There's always gonna be a part of me that's sloppy and dirty, but I like that, with all the other parts of myself. Can you say the same about yourself, fucker?! Can you forgive? Are you any good at that?Hey!I wanted to clarify something. I just want us to be friends. Did you hear what I said? Why are you giving me such a hard time?I don't know how to act with you when you do this shit.Pick me up at seven thirty.Hi.Thank you.Tea.Thanks.Thank you.Why did you order Raisin Bran?It's good. How's your restraining order?And the so-called incident with the weights.I can get a letter to Nikki. I see her sometimes with my sister.I'd have to hide it from Veronica. She's not into breaking the law, which this letter would definitely be doing.I'd have to be careful. I'm already on thin ice with my family, you should hear how I lost my job.By...having sex with everybody in the office.I was very depressed after Tommy died. It was a lot of people.Thanks.Eleven.I know.Okay.Yes.Yes.Hot.Made me sit on her lap and do things? Yeah.Mm-hmm.Mm-hmm.I don't mind it.No. But then people were getting into fights in the parking lot at work, and in the bathroom...and the boss called me in to his office and tried to pin it all on me. So I accused him of harassment and then they fired me, sent me home and put me on some meds.I heard about that.Wow.Yeah.You do.Me too.Yeah, let's get back to the letter.Yes. Yes, that could work. I love that.Can I at least finish my tea?My tea. Can I finish it?I kinda got that feeling, yeah.Yeah, she said you were cool, basically.No, she said you were cool, but you know.Sort of how you are. It's fine, relax.Sort of like me.Why?You think that I'm crazier than you.Oh, my God. Ugh. You're killing me. You know what? Forget I offered to help you. Forget the entire fucking idea. `Cause that must have been fucking crazy because I am so much crazier than you.I'm just the crazy slut with a dead husband!Forget it!Fuck you!You shut the fuck up!Yes, you do.You told your therapist that you were in a superior mental illness category, didn't you?Just leave me alone!You may not have experienced the shit that I did. But you loved hearing about it, didn't you? You are afraid to be alive, you're afraid to live. You're a hypocrite. You're a conformist. You're a liar. I opened up to you and you judged me. You are an asshole. You are an asshole!Get off of me! Get off! You're harassing me!Get off!It's the kids! [Walks to Pat and Officer Keogh]. He didn't do anything, it was all the kids. Officer Keogh turns to push the crowd back.You gonna go your whole life scared of that song? It's just a song. Don't make it a monster. She leans close to Pat's downcast face.There's no song playing. There's no song. Breathe, count backwards from ten. That's it. Pat breathes, listens to her. Calms himself. Song stops. Tiffany's face stays close to his.That's it. There you go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.I took it too far.No, no. No, this was just a joke. This is a joke I started.I know, I have a stupid sense of humor.Well, I'm fucked up. What can I tell you? I'm sorry.Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow, minus the whore thing for the most part.I know. I know you didn't mean it.I know, you say shit you don't mean all the time.I'll still give your letter to Nikki, don't worry. TIFFANY WALKS THE DRIVEWAY TOWARD HER GARAGE. Pat watches her go.I can't, I can't do it.I can't give the letter to Nikki.Because what am I getting in return? What are you doing for me?I know.Because I do this time after time after time, I do all this shit for other people and then I wake up and, and I'm empty, I have nothing!I always get myself in these fucking situations. I give everything to other people and nobody ever, I never -- I don't get what I want, okay? I'm not my sister. Pat takes this in.I can't do it.There's this thing.It's a thing, it's a thing. It's a, it's a dance thing.It's a competition thing at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel. Tommy would never do it with me and I missed it every single year.Would you please!Can we have one conversation without you reminding me that my goddamn husband is dead? My God.But I can only do it if I have a partner...and now I'm about to miss it for another year.What, your schedule is so busy? \"Grapes of Wrath\" and watching football with your dad?All right, then I'm not giving her your fucking letter.Think about it.What? Jordie?Couldn't you say the same about you and Nikki?How are you in love? Tell me about that. The big Nikki love. Tell me about it, I wanna understand it.Wow.It's gonna be amazing, and you're gonna be amazing, and she's gonna be amazing, and you're not gonna be that guy that's gonna take advantage of a situation without offering to do something back. So think about the dance thing.I used the insurance money to build this. I designed it. All the floors are hard oak. It has good bounce for dancers.I'm not that great of a dancer, but who cares? It's therapy and it's fun. And the walls are good `cause I can play music really loud without anybody hearing.Upstairs. It's a garage, I just renovated it. You know, I was thinking about putting a ballet barre here.What?Probably tonight.Ronnie and Veronica and I are gonna see her tonight.Mm-hmm.Yeah. I mean, I hope so.Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's really generous.Yeah.Uh-huh.All right, let's start simple. Start at that corner, walk towards me. Walk across the room. Pat stands in the corner, doesn't move.Are you fucking kidding me?A deal is a deal.Why don't you walk towards me like I'm Nikki. And the only way to convey how much you've missed me is by your walk. By your slow walk. You can't talk.Only walk. Do it.No walk, no letter. Walk to me like I'm Nikki, come on. Do it. I'm Nikki. Come on.Don't look up until you're halfway here.That's right.Not yet.Yes. Do you feel that? That's emotion.Has anybody ever told you how Tommy died?We were married for three years and five days, and I loved him. But for the last couple months, I just wasn't into sex at all. It just felt like we were so different and I was depressed. Some of that is just me, some of it was he wanted me to have kids and I have a hard enough time taking care of myself. I don't think that makes me a criminal. Anyway one night after dinner, he drove to Victoria's Secret at King of Prussia Mall and got some lingerie to get something going. And on the way back, he stopped on 76 to help a guy with a flat tire and he got hit by a car and killed. And the Victoria's Secret box was still in the front seat. That's a feeling.Okay, this is the waltz. I'm gonna teach you the waltz step.Football stays out of this place, so does \"Lord of the Flies.\"I don't give a fuck.What? You're not gonna read that shit on my time. I can tell you all about the \"Lord of the Flies.\" It's a bunch of boys on an island and they have a conch -- they have a shell -- and whoever has the conch has the power and they can talk. And if you don't have the conch, then you don't have the power. And then there's a little chubby boy, and they call him Piggy and they're really mean, and then there's a murder. I mean, humanity is just nasty and there's no silver lining.Hello. Pat told me about you.What? He wrote about me? I'm \"the girl\"?What'd he say?No, please, tell me more about what he said in the letter.Cool.Okay.And then this goes into something else.No.No, please.Bye!I'm gonna pretend that you didn't just ask me that.These are the two days that you have promised me and that we have prepared to nail the big move. It's not ready yet. And we don't have a move yet.Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju?Guess what?Nikki replied to your letter.I just hope you can handle it.She was intrigued, excited, and a little scared.Try to stay positive.No.I thought you were gonna read it out loud.She said to show her something, Pat. This dance can be that something. You would have never done something like this in a million years. It shows all kinds of skills on so many different levels: focus, collaboration, discipline. It's romantic, like I said it would be. It's for her.We need to talk right now! When you make a serious commitment to somebody, it is not cool to not show up!Oh, really?Well, that sounds great, Pat. That's great for all of them, but all of them didn't make a commitment to me in return for my help. I'm Tiffany, by the way.You think I fucked up the Eagles' juju, don't you?I'm the reason why today happened?Let's talk about that.The first night that Pat and I met at my sister's, the Eagles beat the Forty Niners handily, forty to twenty-six. The second time we got together we went for a run and the Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to five in the NLCS.The next time we went for a run the Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty- seven to fourteen.The third time we got together we had Raisin Bran in the diner and the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in the fourth game of the World Series, ten to two.Well, why don't you think about when the Eagles beat the Seahawks, fourteen to seven.He was with me. We went for a run.There have been no games since Pat and I have been rehearsing every day and if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants.Does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of the state of New York is on the official seal of the State of New York? Huh? Anybody? Do you? Do you know? \"Excelsior.\" Look it up. Yeah, \"Excelsior.\"Not that I give a fuck about football or about your superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs, I don't send the Eagles guy whose personal motto is \"Excelsior,\" to a fucking Giants game, especially when he's already in a legal situation.I did my research.Thank you.Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it. You live for this shit. You've been betting against my father for years.You're twisting the knife right now. You get off on it!You get off on it! If not, then prove it. Prove it.By giving them the chance to win back everything, double or nothing.No.Against the Cowboys.That's your team isn't it, Randy?I know who his team is.December twenty-eight, last game of the season.Same day as the Benjamin Franklin Pairs Open Freestyle Dance Competition.Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in America's Team?They go by the Philadelphia rules. Each dancer is scored on a scale of one to ten, ten being the highest. You have to average the four judges' scores.We don't suck. Pat's a beginner, I'm okay, we're happy just to be going there.They're good. Some of them are professionals.Oh, come on, we can get a five out of ten! Gimme a break! Gimme me a break!We can do a five.Pat, you can't quit.Pat, calm down. Thank about it.Pat, no.Pat.You are not a stand up guy right now. If it's me reading the signs...if it's me reading theYou are not a stand up guy!There's only one way to get him to show.We have to tell him Nikki's gonna be there. They stare at her.We have to tell him that she's coming.It's a white lie.There's no other way.We're gonna tell him Nikki'll be there.We have to do it.Yeah. A little bit. But it's for the best.Hey.It's fine.This isn't working!Stupid!This just isn't working!I'm not.I'm focused.Shit.The birds are better when Pat is with me. We settled that.What? I thought you were doing it.I want you to remember everything. I want you to remember all of the good stuff that we have here.Just check in. I gotta go find Veronica.You're killing me. You're killing me!Oh, my God. Oh, my God.Bartender! Bartender, can I get a vodka, please?Sure.So what do you do?Oh, the arguing kind.I've had two vodkas.We're in what?You know, I used to think that you were the best thing that ever happened to me, but now I think that you might maybe be the worst thing and I'm sorry that I ever met you.Got it.Thank you! You're amazing!This is so fucked up.You wrote that a week ago?You let me lie to you for a week?You love me?Okay. SHE LEANS FORWARD AND KISSES HIM, they kiss. Camera pulls away.
