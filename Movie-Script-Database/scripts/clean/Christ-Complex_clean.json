{"Christ-Complex": {"ZOEY": {"raw_line": "...I'm not saying this is an intervention.See and I don't want it to be-It's just...I mean...are you gambling again?Because...um...the laptop, and you never go anywhere with out it--Yeah well...I just know when I met you I saved you from that downhill spiral...you know...uh...the online poker-Of course not...I never said you were.Of course I would. I just-OK...maybe. Honestly we have to save each other, who else is going to do it.True. Is that human nature? People rely on false deities, self help books...Rick the day I realized we were alone in the universe was the day I realized we have to be there for each other. Plus don't you find it romantic that I want to save you? Like a movie...A Cameron Crowe romantic comedy.Yes...of course!Is that...porn?Um.... wait...is that?Us having sex?Yeah...um...I'm not OK with this...What?-What the hell?!? How is it not working?!?I'm not trying to be confrontational...I just...you are breaking up with me?-But you're going toHow so?Rick needed someone stable-That's slightly strong.Misunderstood-Now that's a little off base.It was his gang name.Exaggerations--Unfair. Because these people need someone who is going to sacrifice their own needs for them.Who else is going to do it? We're alone in the universe. If we are going to make it through this \"crazy world\" we need to look out for each other.First of all you are bitter about the whole Dawkins thing, because you flashed him your tits and got us kicked out--And someone who was huge supporter turns her back because Richard Dawkins didn't like her nipple piercing--Enjoy your delusional life there fence sitter. How about you pray to Thor to hit me with a lighting bolt so I can be removed from this asinine conversation.I actually stopped listening to you.Who are those guys?What are they doing?Oh that medieval rugby style game--Sounds pornographic. So Quinn? What else do you know about him?What is this MI-6?No, I'm just curious.I'm so sorry Quinn rubs his temple and then reaches down to pick up the ring.Kinda... Again I'm so sorry.OK?I'm Zoey.Oh name? Yes, most people have interesting stories behind their names...Honestly I have nothing. Not sure why my parents did that.I suppose that's a compliment. So I've seen you around school, but never really...in...class...Oh, well so what do you do?Really? Rent is insane around here...That's pretty cool. What's he into?An entrepreneur...That's awesome. Well...So do you like coming down here?Yes where we are right now.Yeah me too. I just suffered a break up.No it's OK. I mean I'm over it.I'm sorry.So what did you need to think about? I mean if I'm not prying of course.I'm not sure anyone is. You know if you need a friend, I'd be glad to...well you know...listen.I know. I mean...I've seen you around campus...you seem like a loner...I didn't mean you were a loser. Loner is kind of sexy, loser...well can kind of be too...I'll stop.So we can maybe go out to dinner if you want?And I can pay, you know..make up for the head...No I want to.Well... Good let's meet up tonight. My place, 7pm.Quinn, is he being rude?Let's go.Anna, you going to call the guard dog off?Don't wait upSorry about Jack...No not at all. This is on me.Listen Quinn, I'm an atheist--No, I just wanted to get it out of the way. It bothers people, I mean in this state especially.Really?I'm pretty sure I'm really an atheist.Because I'm a logical thinker. I don't mean to offend, I'm guessing you're religious.Oh my God you are in the ministry.My father was a \"fire and damnation\" preacher. Baptist...He's...It's nothing. Sorry I don't mean to rock your world.You poor thing. You are probably so desperate for friends-Have you thought about St John's Wort?No I'm thinking out loud mostly. I was just...well...you have some social awkwardness.Well you are latching on to religion to make you feel whole. It doesn't make you feel whole, or at least as whole as you thought it would-So you are out with me...I represent everything you were brought up to combat. You're missing something and you are looking for help.See I'm good at reading people.I don't know Quinn you seem like a lost soul. I thought that when I saw you by the river.Yeah I actually do. Someone needs to save them.If you let me.So what do you need Quinn?He seems harmless.I know. He's in the ministry-I know and he's understanding of that.It was understood.You guys leaving?Will you guys stop??Will you guys leave??Bye guys!Sorry about that.Tonight's Feature Presentation is \"I am Curious:Yellow\". Probably not the best date movie, but I always show this to ever guy in the beginning.What??This might be a little hard-core for your first film.I feel like I'm stealing your virginity here.You're a virgin too aren't you?Oh my god! I'm a bad girl.OK? I mean I usually play this for potential boyfriends. If they can handle this, they can handle me.I guess you're lucky I thought about \"They Call Her One Eye\". I hope this doesn't jack you up.Why haven't I seen your place?That doesn't surprise me. I can't imagine you having a vast Blu Ray collection.Wow...Quinn, you have to start enjoying the world around you.So you're saying you want to come up stairs and watch \"They Call Her One Eye\"?Yeah...sorry about that...I...I..I'm sorry.I shouldn't have been that aggressive.OK?Puzzling...but I know...virgin and all-That came out rude...I just mean...I wanted to do it. I should have taken it slower.You sure?I hope so.What's going on??Quinn? What's wrong?What are you talking about? Anna is right?OK?OK Quinn, just spit it out.Oh honey...You must have a brain tumor or something. You're obviously mentally ill.Shhh. You need me more than ever.Yes?Enjoy myself? Of course.It was nothing.It's not a big deal. It was...a...well wouldn't call it a nightmare...repressed memory. Hell, it's not repressed...I think of it all the time.You don't want to hear about it.My father, I mentioned him before, was a Baptist minister. He always said he had this \"sickness\". He begged my mom for help, it was more important though for her to having shopping and dinner dates with her girlfriends. Anna, my friend that \"loves you\", has been in my life since I was tiny. She used to come over all the time. My Dad adored her. When I was around twelve I found something in the closet...tapes. My Dad and Anna from the time she was like seven...He... I showed my Mom, and Dad...well he got out of prison when I was seventeen. I don't see him anymore. His church, even though they knew he had a problem disowned him. He wouldn't have done that to Anna if my mom would have supported him, got him help.He tried to get help Quinn, he reached out to my Mom. I should have protected Anna too...I mean-I have to protect people. This was out of my control, you Quinn...What's going on with you...I have control of that.Me too.You're not actually going to fight your friend to the death are you?Quinn, in 2 days things are going to be normal. This is just a delusion.I understand that.What is it?What was wrong?What are you talking about?I haven't heard from Quinn since he wigged out today.He needs me.This isn't about me and you-What fucking file?So is the file folder for dramatic effect?Quinn?You mentioned that earlier. What is going on?I thought that was the whole plan.Why don't you come over here.Come on Quinn get a grip. Just calm down and come over here.OK so just come on over and we'll talk.Quinn? No wait-I don't know. He's losing it.So what is all this?You're not telling me anything I didn't already know.I'm too far into this now. I don't have a choice.Let me be guys.What's this?I gathered that. Under Quinn's room...Quinn's roommate was Ryan Blood?Ah fuck.Excuse me?I'm looking for Mrs. Rhodes. I believe the people here referred to her as \"mother\".I'm sure they do. You guys shutting down?Is there something wrong with you?What? I don't know what that means.Um...no...listen do you know Quinn Wilson and Louis Marks? They grew up here.What?Um...no.What a fucking nut house!What!And?Wait Louis? You think Louis made Quinn appear crazy?There is more to it than that.Listen \"Robot Boy\", where did this whole belief come from? This isn't something two kids come up with on their own.Exactly. I heard there was an employee that got fired for sharing Mormon mythology with the boys.How?Well...elaborate.-How is that different than a dream? Just saying-So she had Quinn committed?Fucking Ryan Blood!Thanks Jack.I'm going to stop an Apocalyptic battle.You need to learn to lock up.Why the change of heart?Do you really believe? You know?I'll help you Quinn. I don't want to do it for myself...I don't want to do it because I feel I have to. Obligations, or dark incidents from my past...That's not a reason to help anyone. It makes me fucking selfish actually.I care about you Quinn. That's sincerely my reason for wanting to do this. That's a first for me you know?I'm not doing it anymore. You will not have redemption from me.Take ownership of what you did. Don't rely on me to save you. I need to start saving myself.Goodbye.You're fucking crazy!I think you're a fucking nut bag.Mrs Rhodes? Does that name ring a bell?Go fuck yourself.Mrs. Rhodes? What about her? Other than she fucked you guys up. She taught you, Louis how to play it straight. Then she has you fuck Quinn over.Yeah by getting him in contact with you.Is that why she placed you in that hospital?Guys I have let my parents fuck me up. There comes a time though where you have to go out on your own. Take responsibility for your own life.This whole thing was to carry out some delusional woman's master plan. She doesn't even remember who she is at this point. I went to see her...she wanted me to take off my shirt.I thought you didn't believe this shit anymore.This is fucked. Quinn you're not 5000 years old. You were born in an orphanage. None of this makes sense.That makes total fucking sense. Color me stupid!What the fuck!No you don't. Guys what are you doing?Are you being serious?If you don't walk away from this field right now, you will lose me. I will not be in your corner. I will call for help. They will stop you.Quinn...last chance. Zoey walks over to Ryan's body. She searches till she finds her cell phone in his front pocket.I will call the police Quinn...Wow...yeah goodbye.I am Curious:Yellow Goodbye boys...For years we have thought absence of the impossible indicated that we were exercising free thought. In my experience ladies and gentleman, that's not the case. Believing in hope my friends, opening yourself up to accepting there might be more than the world around you. That's truly being a free thinker.Hey...Just sitting here...thinking...I've had a great life. A wonderful husband, children, grandchildren... ...great grandchildren...I spent so much of my youth being angry. I wish I could relive my life now, knowing what I know.I've tried to pass it on to you.Just remember, you can believe what you want to believe Jennifer. Live by what ever moral code you want to live by. Just make sure it's yours. Don't let it stem from anger or past tragedies. Let it come from your heart.What is it?Likewise.I didn't catch your name.Yeah I'm fine.
