You're gonna be my cheerleader.Alley-oop, Dad.I can't do this shit.\"Can't\" should never be in a man's vocabulary.Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.Later, Dad.We still have to go?So...does it hurt?For real?So how come you could play basketball?I never knew a girl that could play.Your Dad play?My Dad plays for the \"Clippers.\" He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too. Same number and everything.He's alright, but my Dad can take him.I don't know. A lot.You do act different.Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.She don't know how to box, I bet. My dad showed me how to fight like Ali.Bet you can't do this though.Sorry.You wanna be my girl?I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together. And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.Oh.Kay.I think we gotta kiss now.Five seconds.My Dad always drives my Mom.So that means I have to ride with you.Man, forget you then, stupid.What?Shut up!Yo, Felicia, I gotta get to my game.Girl, she knew I had a hottie like you up inhere, she'd beat the black off me.Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.Didn't we already have this conversation?Yeah? So you up for a game later?You don't wanna hurt your back.You work too hard, Pop.I know this. What do you want?Your legs don't look broke.Guess \"please\" would be a stretch.What's that?Big-ass titties?Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.And?So she's honest.Didn't know you cared so much.So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.Your hot-ass temper.God, here we go.That's it, give it your best shot.I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.I'm warning you. You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.With a jacked-up attitude.I don't.What's up, Moms.Uh, your earring?What are you doing in my room?We were just studying.Okay.I've been hearing you.Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.Yup.Said he'd be home later.I don't know, he had a meeting or something.Oh...shit.See you made it.You don't look half-bad.Q.Hey.You having fun?Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though. So who is this clown?Guess not.You know, it was late and she asked...C'mon.I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.Figures.None of your business.That what you think?Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.Four.You had four offensive rebounds.When'd you get this?You sure?What was that about?You want to stop?Yeah.Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.We'll see.What?I can't be nice to a fan?I can't help girls coming up to me.It's okay, little baby.Shhh. Daddy's here.All these girls...you're the only one I know who's for real.Forget Tonya Randall.Then prove her wrong.So you're gonna act salty all night?Nah, thanks.Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA. You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.So how about a little one-on-one?Clothes.I score, you strip. You score, I drop something.My court, I go first.Plan to.Oh, my bad.Right here.I wanted you to....up and under between two defenders, with the left hand. That's gotta make SportsCenter.You know, the numbers I'm putting up are better than any freshman. Some people are saying I'm a definite lottery pick.You know, people.I'm also good enough to go pro.You came out early.Okay...What mess?What?Tell me what?I mean, it's not true, is it?Sorry.So what are you gonna do?Why?What's Mom think?Thanks.Sorry. You okay?Last time I remember you drinking was when Marvin Gaye died.Don't sweat it, okay. Sooner or later the truth'll come out.Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.This is just about money, you know that.I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's? He wouldn't lie.Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...What has he been to me? I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing. Like it was easy. And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...He even had me wanting to play for the \"Clippers.\" Man, how stupid am I.I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this...I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?Why not?Didn't realize you were watching the clock.Nah. Don't sweat it.For real. I should be alone, anyway.What's up?Here I am.It happens, right...I heard.Nah.That's funny.You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?Excuse me.Guess you didn't see the game.Q.Nobody.Look, this party's whack. You ready to go?Not really.You know what, I'm just gonna crash.Nah. I have curfew.What are you doing here?Still is, so let yourself out.We ain't got nothing to talk about.Lucky kid.And some things should never fucking happen!I ain't a damn liar.So now you're saying my mother trapped you?Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you. I'm dropping out of school and going pro.From your mouth.Always thought \"can't\" wasn't in a man's vocabulary.Hey, what's up.Yeah, sorry about that. I had this meeting with this guy.The \"man\" again.Hey, you.Oh, Kerry, this is Monica. Monica, Kerry.We're going to get some food.Can we talk?I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.Least she had time for me.I just said I didn't fuck around. But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.You forgot to be there.Stay!Least you got your priorities straight.Never had to.Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me? Go fuck Dick Vitale.I'm not asking for us to be together.I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.I don't think so.Look, I'm entering the draft.I decided to go pro. And who knows where I'll end up, you know?Few days ago.Damnitt, Monica. This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.So...I guess I'll see you around.What do you want?After five years.Look, I'm busy.I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?Good.And now I'm paying for it, right? That what this is about? \"I told you so?\"Yeah.You're still trying to tell me what I should and shouldn't do. How come you couldn't be the man you kept trying to make me?Monica?Alright. I heard you were in Spain.Just something I'm trying.Thanks.I'm alright. But you can sit.Yup.A lot of things. All I know is I'll be back in six months.Not for Quincy McCall.So, how's pro-ball, Europe?Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?Funny. I never did.Tried calling you a couple times.Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American. And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.Figured it was something like that.What do you mean?A rest?No.It's okay.I'm gonna be okay.Kyra, this is Monica. She, uh...This is Kyra. My fiance.It means a lot that you came by.Thanks.Damn, girl.I don't wanna see that.Brother's gonna have to start locking doors.So how long is this trip?Nah.You might be the only one with a job.Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?I don't know sometimes.A horse?I remember when your mom had to beat you into a dress.Kyra's gone for a couple days. Figured I'd keep Mom company.Darryl. He's alright, kinda corny.Getting there.Yeah. Two weeks. I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...Can I ask you something?Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?Nah. I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months. Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him. Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.Maybe go back to school.I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet. She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.So why'd you give up ball?Cause I don't get it.What?Find.What's going on?Hold on.What?you woke me up to tell me that?I heard enough.We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?You haven't changed. You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass. Well, guess what, it doesn't.Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.Wrong.What?For what?You're out of your mind.What's that supposed to be, psychology?Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay. I mean, I was lost. So you are forgiven. But that was five years ago. I moved on.What will this prove?So?And what happens when you lose?One, five.

Can you just...?I knew it.I know, right?I can take it.Coach hates me, doesn't she?What's up with that?Thanks, Sidra.You finish the reading for E-con?What'd it say?Whatever, big head.You do see me standing here, right?Fine, Quincy.I said fine.Quit.You're such a punk.Always.What?Coach...I was just playing ball.Didn't have to try very hard.What?I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.I don't have it easy like you, alright.

Yes.It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.Thanks.Reg. You seen Quincy?Derek said Q was here.Hey.I've been trying to find you all day.Sorry about your game.he's just playing, Q...Y'all need to quit.What's up?But?Thanks.I know.What's that?Who was that?Who's nobody?You want to go talk?We could finish what we were talking about last night.Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.Hey, y'all.Hey.You weren't at my game.Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.Woman...What the hell's going on?Are you out of your mind?No. You stay, I'll leave.Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.Dad around?Yeah.What?Talk to your new girlfriend.Cheap date.So you fucked around to prove a point!What, \"Q-man\", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew. What was I supposed to do?If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!I never asked you to choose.I'm a ballplayer. If anyone knows what that means it should be you.How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me? If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.What?How are you going to tell me what I have time for? I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.You don't think so?You're what?When did you decide all this?So that's it, just forget about us?Friends.Uh huh.Oye.Oye, Luisa.Si. Large game.What did he say?What's up, Sidra.How do you say \"you're dreaming\" in Italian?You mean my championship trophy? My bad.Uno mas, por favor.Just like that?How's that been?Please, I went through the same drama as everybody else. I mean, the first four months, only person I could talk to was this chick Luisa, who knew like ten words of English from watching old \"Dif'rent Strokes\" reruns. Swear to God, I had to tell her if she said, \"What you talking bout, Willis?\" one more time, I was gonna kick her ass.I wouldn't know.Just not my type, I guess.You ever think about going back?I'm sorry.I was. I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.No, it looks good. I mean, it's cool.Shouldn't you be lying down, or...I'm fine. My dad said you tore your ACL.What are the doctors saying?I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.I forgot, \"Q-man.\"We won the championship.Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.Kiss my ass.Oh yeah?Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine. It was always messing up.Actually, I don't...I'm tired of playing overseas. Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.Yeah. Basketball just, isn't fun anymore. You know?Fiance. Wow. Congratulations.I didn't know. Wow. That's great. Well...I should go.Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.Need any help?Yeah. Can't wait to see him I just saw Quincy.Engaged.Yeah, you met her?Maybe she is.So what do I do?Whatever.I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.There you go.So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a \"dumb\" jump shot?No I don't.I wasn't Lena. I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.That's not it.I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal. All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table. And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas. And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.I do. You never stood up for yourself. Ever. If I was ashamed, it was because of that.What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.I'm sorry.That's all you cared about. I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.It mattered, Mom.Dad. What are you doing here?That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.You know.You shoot like a girl.And she gets the steal. Monica goes one- on-one against Jordan, she stops, pops...You visiting?Who's this guy I always see her around?So...how's the knee?Strong enough to get you down the aisle?That's okay. I'm probably, you know, busy.It just isn't.You had a rough couple years, that's all.And you tore up your knee. Rehab is tough.You're serious.Like what?Wow.It's a trip, you know? When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.Why do you keep asking me that?Something was just missing.It doesn't matter, alright. Just leave it alone.What are you talking about?We need to talk.You asked me what was missing.From basketball.It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.Then why are you so upset?Better late than never, right?I'll play you.One game. One-on-one.Your heart.So you're gonna bitch up?I know why you broke up with me in college. And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too. So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.Prove it.You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.Check.Nine, up.

The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.I don't remember that.That's ridiculous.Dammitt, Monica!Is that really all you think of me?You had your coaches and your father for that stuff. It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.So you're still breast-feeding?You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.Okay.God. \"Grandma.\"When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.", "clean_line": "needs stop running like little boy alright looking way ll ice black family street black family door thanks nice oh cook friends parties things atlanta nathan gets settled girls little older definitely want love cook maybe talk come monica oh work lucky box dresses pile rags garbage fine like wear sure brushes teeth need lay ve running day blue okay boy door riding school ll know somebody day hurry sleep want thicker base cut potato use little flour means alright act like know hoping ll grow tomboy thing funnywatch mouth listen realize lot going smart pretty comb head mean walk hair looking like whodunit monica taste child bite sure things good luck drawer pearls tonight worry yesterday game recruiters want enjoy beautiful monica defensive surprised bank going dinner lose attitude game hi manage stewardess mother cookout weeks ago lot better ask thought registered send gift want opinion place ask curse want tell monica beat girl sex going yes believe thinking people important yes bake pie shoot dumb jump shot makes prissy bad turning nose child little thought good wrong wanting teach things knew help angry standing hair combed wearing perfume oh yes superstar female athlete mother housewife tell aren ashamed know remember ridiculous dammitt monica think coaches father stuff mattered way went games breast feeding want jacket getting cold okay god grandma said quincy better thinking"}, "ZEKE": {"raw_line": "Girl, who you trying to fool?See, Quincy, this is how your Moms caught me, with the old fake and bake. Had me thinking I was getting a sister who could burn.Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?Why not?That's right.What? Oh, and, uh, don't say \"shit.\"Just you and Quincy, baby. I got a meeting.Business folks.Nona, don't start bitching. I got maybe two years left to play. I'm just trying to put some things together for us.Don't go starting rumors, Jim. My son's college bound with or without basketball.Gotta wait til the press conference.I'd love for him to get a good education. That's it.I don't care about the team. I care about the school.You played good. I was proud of you.I don't wanna hurt your feelings.Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.Hey, Miss Baller.I had some players to see and hands to shake.I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.Yeah.I have.No, you said I should get my degree. I like my \"bullshit\" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold.Keep your voice down.Genuine Draft. And an orange juice for my kid.Didn't need a cross-over to post you up.What people?Well, tell them to mind their damn business. You're smart enough to get a degree.You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA? Give yourself time to develop, Quincy. Get an education. The NBA ain't going nowhere.Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices. You don't have a choice.Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.there's this thing out there. This paternity suit.Some girl that's been hanging on at every party. now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy. Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.I just told you.You got the balls to ask me that?No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it. It's not true.I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the \"Clips.\" This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years. Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart. We'll just have to see how it plays out. I'm giving her some space, couple days...Your door was unlocked.We need to talk.I messed up, okay, I know that. But I ain't that kid's father.Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man. But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel. And another twenty that made it past security on your floor. And the boldest one is standing right at your door. And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game. I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have. But I did it cause I love you.What?I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.Nona.What's that, not great?Nona, please.Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that. How you been?Hey, son.Came by to check on you.Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.I can see that. I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.No.Quincy. I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.You want me to fuck off?Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.I just couldn't", "clean_line": "girl trying fool quincy moms caught old fake bake thinking getting sister burn boy tell word right oh uh shit quincy baby got meeting business folks nona start bitching got maybe years left play trying things starting rumors jim son college bound basketball gotta wait til press conference love good education care team care school played good proud wanna hurt feelings gotta meeting tell mom gonna late let hope day hey miss baller players hands shake gonna punching clock wife attitude yeah said degree like bullshit job okay gonna lead spot office til worry savings ass gucci gold voice genuine draft orange juice kid need cross post people tell mind damn business smart degree know higher play level nba time develop quincy education nba ain going mom got pregnant choices choice sooner pro sooner ll deal mess dealing thing paternity suit girl hanging party supposed baby daddy told mom wanted told told got balls ask need hear ll true want thing court lawyer telling settle case like hang months player relations job clips gets false ll touch haven exactly living fairy tale life past years like happens brings family closer pushes apart ll plays giving space couple days door unlocked need talk messed okay know ain kid father look ain saying right things happen boy perfect look mom real quick pictures wasn nineteen got pregnant wrong best thing life knew wasn ready marriage saying handled responsibilities like man nba pull city women waiting hotel past security floor boldest standing right door awhile game sorry lied shouldn cause love know mad okay let nona great nona recognize hair like hey son came check remember fault like divorced time mom know things look pretty bleak right quincy know left school early throw middle finger want fuck fine ll fuck til couldn"}}}
