Thank you so much...I...yeah...I'll be fine...It's just...that new girl...I almost hit her in the parking lot...I can't do any better...What's your major malfunction?How'd you know about my inheritance?And what, pray tell, are you willing to wager when I win?Take your sorry ass back to the swamps.Nah. I'm cool.Jay! What about my present?Jay? e's nowhere to be found. Frustrated, Marie finds herself alone in the kitchen. She angrily selects a bottle of Champagne, pops the cork. Before she can swig any alcohol she hears raised voices.I was just...This is a private party...Get the hell outta here! NOW!Stay away from my stepfather!This...trash is just looking for a meal ticket...But...what about...my present...It's present time.What the hell...I just...wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier. I was out of line.So...what about my present?It was...it was what Mom wanted...I'm...responsible...But they're mine. Mom left them to me.Team Clifford...What the hell?Jay, what's going on?We're team Clifford.I can't believe it, Jenny...It just doesn't make sense...I mean, I know Jay...I know he'd never...This can't be...Jay...is innocent...What the hell are you doing here?Give me that back. It was my Mother's...Is that what this is all about?You're ruining my life, and my stepfather's.Why are you doing this?It was my birthday. Jay left the party before giving me my present.I did.She was...she looked fine. She smiled at me. Actually smiled...We don't see...eye to eye...No...I was...she wasn't invited...I'd had a drink. Yes.A glass of Champagne. Or two, but...What's the key for?But...they're my inheritance...But, Jay...they're my diamonds...t's wrong.I can't...I don't think I'll be able to, I'm sorry...We need to talk.Let's just get this over with. You won. You got what you wanted...We are prepared to make it worth your while.No, that's not the deal.You're going to tell the truth on the stand tomorrow, yes?Lying bitch!No such thing as can't...Who's there?Who invited you?I was sure you'd blow it on the stand, going on about forgetting and remembering.But you'll never forget.What the...If anyone sees us together...Gotta be careful. Make sure no one's listening. Now what's the 411?How?No bigee. You disposed of everything, right? The teeth, the video, all the research...I won't let the big bad wolf get you. I promise.Be patient. I'll call the Museum Curator, have him prepare the funds to buy back the diamonds...Just sit back, relax, enjoy the trip...Don't forget to come again. heir trembling lips come together like wet hot magnets...Can I help you?I'm in the middle of practice...Of course.How...Jay needed help. We're a team.He said I wasn't ready.No, of course not.How should I know?What plan?Hello?What the hell, Chad? Chad fidgets nervously.Not you too. She's just trying to prove her worthless excuse for an existence. She doesn't have a thing on us.No. We stick to the plan. Give the Curator time to come up with the money...You can't take the heat, get outta the kitchen.You're gonna be the death of me... She slugs the rest of the drink, strides away and Chad follows like a lapdog... INT. CLIFFORD MANSION - JAY'S OFFICE - NIGHT Nothing's been touched in Jay's office, the drops of blood the Cubans extracted from his thumb as a warning stain the white carpet black... Marie walks over to his desk, opens a draw. Removes a metallic lock box.What did you...Chad fucked us.No, I mean he really fucked us. He drugged me an' took the diamonds!Yeah, it's all a big joke...He stole the diamonds!Keep it down, my headache's bad enough as it is.He's heading to the museum, got himself an 8am meeting...Not if we find him first...'m not gonna hurt him. No way...I'm gonna kill him.No, I'm pretty damn far from okay...He bolted...With the diamonds.Chad! There's nowhere to run to, you little weasel!Gotcha...What now?You telling me your Parole Officer knows you're out here?You hear that?You go that way...You see him?Elena?Useless bitch...What are you doing? Our diamonds are about to become dinner...Get rid of the body. And his car...Where do you think?Chad made us an appointment to sell these. I'm gonna keep it...Then I suggest you get to work...Never better. Got the money?Good. he fishes in her bag for the diamonds...Change of plans. My 'associate' got tied up at work. Completely swamped...Calm down. It's just blood.So?Can you get the cash or not?Then let's have those dead presidents...What the hell are you doing?NO!That's my inheritance is it, Mom? Goddamn Christmas ornaments...I hate you, Mom! I'm glad you're dead!The diamonds are fakes. Totally worthless.Believe it. I'm leaving. Tonight.Don't you understand? There's no money. Nothing. Zip. Zilch. Zero. How am I supposed to take care of your broke ass?I'll send you a photo.I'm gone, gone, gonski.Okay, talk...School swimming pool. One hour.It's already done.So?Blah, blah, blah. Get over it. He's dead. Now you told me you had a plan. Spit it out.That's your brilliant plan? It's in a safe, dumb ass. You a safecracker? Have you got magic fingers, gonna pick that lock? I don't think so. Next.Like hell we are.How much money?We don't have to tell the cops anything. We'll let Jay's videotape do the talking.I kept a copy. Never trusted you backstabbers.You're trembling.Ssshhhh...Alright. Let's do it...Very funny. Did you know the diamonds were fakes?We want money. Whatever you've got in your safe at the beach condos.You give us the combination and this goes in the nearest mail box, tied with a pretty pink bow.You're gonna have to trust us.This is non-negotiable.What's the combination?No such word as 'can't'...The combination's the day Mom died, you sick fuck?One down...Two down.99. A very good year...Money. Always in style.You stupid fucking Sherbert. You think you could sell me out?Morrison doesn't know his prick from a pogo stick. And that bitch Parole Officer, she hasn't got the balls for this...I just want what's mine...My fucking Step-Monster'll never give me the Goddamn key...You take a check?How'd you like to make some real cash?Shut it, bitch.

He didn't.......just sexually assault me.He didn't just sexually assault me. He threatened to kill me if I told anyone... he court is on the verge of erupting into anarchy. Theo's reeling, caught off-guard, stumbling over his words, trying to give the girl one last chance to make good on her promise.I was messed up, alright. In fact, only two things I remember. One was that bastard Jay Clifford taping me with that Goddamn video camera while he violated me. The other was what he whispered in my ear, right before I blacked out...He said, \"You won't remember, but you'll never forget.\"Mother and Daughter...Gotta make it seem authentic.

We gotta go or she'll find us here...Please...Hel..help me...Where are you going?I don't...I don't have a clue...It's only a matter of time before my Parole Officer finds me...Jesus...Don't do this to me, please...You gotta have a lighter or some...Jesus...I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...It was...it was an accident...Told me what?Chad swerved off the road, I swear...It was an accident...The crash. He...he hit his head...I'll do whatever you want.I'll tell you the truth. I'll tell you what happened. She killed him, and took the diamonds. Marie, it was Marie Clifford...Yello...No. That can't be true!You can't...what about...me...I...I gotta see you.Please.

You know that don't you?Marie! Please, I can't do this...I told you not to kill Chad. I'll tell it to the police.I'll tell 'em you made me lie about your stepfather raping me, made me perjure myself on the stand, went and killed Chad, and now...Why'd you do it? Why'd Chad have to die?You killed him, Marie. You murdered him in cold blood...They made me do it...Please, don't...Nothin' like the real thing. Switched 'em for the fakes right after Marie tried to pay me off...The mother.You want me to top you off?We've had some practice along the way...Here you go, Mr. Clifford....But you'll never forget.Nice take off. Gotta work on the landing.Almost done here.Not on your life.
