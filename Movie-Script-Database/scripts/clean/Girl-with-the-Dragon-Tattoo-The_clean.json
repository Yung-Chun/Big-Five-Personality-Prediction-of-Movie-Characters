Would you like to freshen up? We'll be having dinner later. For now, hot tea is waiting. Unless you'd like a drink instead. What would you like?What?Oh. I guess I'd better be quick then. Thank you, Dirch. Mikael, this way. INT. VANGER'S STUDY - DAYWhat do you know about me?Used to. That's correct.My grandfather forged the tracks the 4:30 train will take you home on - and most of the other pre-state-owned rail lines. We stitched this country together. We made the steel and milled the lumber that built modern Sweden. You know what our most profitable product now is? Fertilizer.I'm not obsessed with the declining health of the company, but I am with the settling of accounts - and the clock is ticking. I need your help.Officially, assisting me with my memoirs. But what you'd really be doing is solving a mystery. And you'd do that by doing what you do so well - this recent legal mishap of yours notwithstanding. You'd be investigating thieves, misers, bullies, and malcontents - the most detestable collection of people you'll ever meet ... my family. A30 EXT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING A30Richard, who I may as well start with to get it out of the way, was a Nazi of the first order - joining the Nationalist Socialist Freedom League when he was 17.Isn't it interesting how fascists always steal the word freedom. The 4:30. Yes. Okay. Anyway, Richard died a martyr to the Nazi cause in 1940 - missed all the real excitement - but not the opportunity to regularly beat his wife Margareta and their son, Gottfried.Now, Gottfried - Harriet's father - was what people used to call a Good- Time-Charlie.Are they? Okay. INSERT: Close on a photo of Gottfried.He was a charmer, a ladies man, a drunk. In other words, a born salesman - which is what he did for the company - traveling around, taking clients out to dinner and so on.That's right. Anyway, he died in 1965. Drowned. Drunk. Here on the island. A studio photo: Gottfried with his wife and two children.His wife Isabella - who was pretty much useless before as a parent - became even more so after his death - which is when I began looking after their children - Martin - who runs Vanger Industries now that I'm retired - and Harriet.She was bright and curious, a winning combination in any person.Someone in the family murdered Harriet and for the last forty years has been trying to drive me insane. OMIT: INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - DAY EXT. TRAIN STATION - HEDESTAD - DUSKIt was September 21st, 1966. A Saturday. Harriet was 16.What was she going to tell me? Why didn't I make time for her? Why didn't I listen?Not without being seen.Firemen stayed on the bridge all night pumping out the gasoline. And no one swam across, or took a row boat. All of them were still tied up on this side Sunday. Believe me, we checked. 45B INT. VANGER MANOR - DUSK - PRESENT DAY 45BThe currents aren't strong here. Anything that falls into the water turns up nearby. Like her father. His body didn't drift more than ten meters when he drowned the year before. Vanger's pauses at a landing to steady himself and his labored breathing.No. Someone killed her, Mr. Blomkvist. Someone on the island that day. Someone close enough to know what she used to give me each year on my birthday. He unlocks the door of the attic and pushes it open to reveal a cluster of nine dusty framed dried flowers on a wall.These were from her.These, from her killer. Blomkvist regards the forty ...Me, the police, the murderer ... and now you.- studying their reports and interviews, all the information there was, and it's a lot. I've spent half my life examining the events of a single day. And for all that, he's no closer to the truth.We haven't discussed your fee.You don't know that. You have a very keen investigative mind.Here's what I propose: You come stay on the island. I have a nice little cottage by the water you can use. You study the material I give you. You find something I've missed - or you don't.Think of it as a well deserved vacation. A way of avoiding all the people you want to avoid right now. As for compensation, I'll pay you twice your salary for as many months as it takes. I'll quadruple it if you solve the mystery.I'm not done. I'll throw in one more thing - even though you're a terrible negotiator. It's what you want more than anything else and it can't be bought at any price. I'll give it to you ... Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.He began his career working for me. And I've followed it with interest, shall we say, ever since. You were right about him. You just couldn't prove it.The island is owned by my family. Your closest neighbor is my brother Harald, another Nazi if you can believe. Two in the family. He's detestable to put it nicely, but you'll probably never see him. He's a recluse.Indeed he was.That's his daughter Cecilia's house. They don't speak.Actually, Isabella - Harriet's mother - who lives there - - she speaks to Harald - which is one of reasons I don't speak to her. Cecilia's brother Birger lives there.You, probably. Not that you'd want him to. He can be as unpleasant as Harald.Oh, how you'll wish were it always so. Soon you'll know us all only too well - with my apologies. Out there is my nephew Martin's house; Harriet's brother.I speak to him. He runs the company now, as I think I told you.Someone shooting their dinner. Gunner probably. The caretaker.He was 19 when Harriet disappeared.He lives over there.Sorry?Yes, you're right. The man who hires the detective should always be kept on the suspects list. 66A OMIT - INT. COTTAGE - DAY 66AIt's down the hall.It is. She lives with me.Her mother is.This way. Morell follows Vanger down a hall -Please. I beg you. INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, \"authorized our patrol boat and two volunteer craft to begin 12:20 a.m. - G. Morell.\"I apologize if you're having financial problems at the magazine in Mikael's absence.Are you sure?You know, I used to be in the newspaper business. We owned six dailies back in the 50's.I let my nephew Birger run it since he can't run anything else.We're talking about an investment in the magazine.I feel bad that I've take Mikael away from you at the worst possible time. This is the right thing to do. The moral thing. That's one reason.The enemies of my friends are my enemies. I hate Wennerstrom as much as you hate what he's done to you. Silence.So what do you say?Is that a maybe? She nods.Wonderful! More wine, Anna.I think Mikael is adapting well to rustic life, by the way.Put the logs on end, like this.There's another reason. I don't like bullies. REPORTER 3 Are you referring to Mr. Wennerstrom?I'm referring to anyone who tries to sue their enemies into submission. If Mr. Wennerstrom would like to try it again, he'll find himself fighting a company that can afford to fight back.

I can't find something you haven't been able to in forty years.You want me to set aside my life and career for something that's a complete waste of time.Mr. -You fired me; I need something to do.Like I've been gutted. Like I'm running away. I am. They cross through the building, he with his cases, she with her coffee cup.Wennerstrom wants to see me waving a white flag, not a red one.

TRAIN STATION - HEDESTAD - DAY The depot thermometer reads 0. Blomkvist disembarks with two suitcases. This time, Frode isn't there to meet him. He struggles with his luggage through the snow to a taxi stand. INT. TAXI - MOVING - DAYThink this snow's going to let up anytime soon?What. Milk?It's me. I'm here. It's fucking cold and I'm on a pay phone. If you tried to call, the reception sucks, and if you tried to email, there's none of that either, so - so - I'm here - and - I can't even speak it's so fucking cold.I'm writing a biography of Mr. Vanger, yes.That's unfortunate.He was there that day?Does anyone speak to anyone on this island?Who doesn't he speak to?I'm quickly losing track who's who.Who speaks to him?I just met him.And you live here.Your house.Business? She was sixteen.She was with some friends that day. At a parade. You must have talked to them.I have one.It's at the National Forensic Lab.I wanted to ask you about this.It's the last page I'm curious about.The only names not alphabetized. Morell nods that he knows that only too well as he turns to that last page. On it, in neat handwriting: Magda 32016 Sara 32109 R.J. 30114 R.L. 32027 Mari 32018I've reminded you of things you'd rather forget. I'm sorry.Was this also a missing girl case?I'm afraid I'm a bit out of shape.Is that what this is?That one's good.That was a dark day.It's okay. There are worse things than libel - though I can't immediately think of one in my business.Henrik's biography.They are.I do.Maybe we could talk about that later.How so.You were here that day?I know it well.It's not about the family. It's about Henrik and the company.It's not my intention to present a malicious portrait of anyone.Unlike that one. Correct.I can't ignore such a dramatic event, but no, that's not by any means my focus.Since we're talking about it, since you brought it up, what was Harriet like?He was my age then, and so couldn't know what was really going on with a teenager any more than I can with my own daughter. You were her age.I'd love to, where is she.You don't know where your own sister lives?I'm getting used to that comment.People generally get over that sort of thing at a certain point.I'll try to track her down for you.For myself then.Excuse me. I'm sure I should have made an appointment.I'm Mikael.I would if had any money to invest.I'm writing a biography of your uncle Henrik. That's why I'm here. She stares at him. He waits for the response Cecilia predicted, but it doesn't come. EXT. CAFE - LONDON - DAYGood. Engaging. I like him.Most of what I'm writing about predates that, so your recollections are valid.I can narrow it. I've gotten up to the 1960s. To the event that altered everything in Henrik's life.Morell.I'm not speaking of the crime itself. I'm trying to get a clearer sense of what Harriet was like. Particularly, toward the end.Was he abusive?Hers.She never confided in you what about, specifically?What do you think happened to her?But you have no ... thoughts about why, or who.No.What have I missed besides you?Seriously?I'm not. I'm working.Would you like to meet him?Excuse me. Did I miss something?I gather. Why would you want to do that?How long have you been discussing this with them?Why didn't you tell me?So I deserve to be treated like an idiot?I'm saying it now.
