Jerry smiles, turns and grabs the old man by the shirt.Let's get something straight. I don't like you. As soon as we're on our way, that's it.Keep yer' mouth shut.Don't want a Buick. Want a Ford.Then take the Buick.What's your name, boy?Well, okay Phillip. Reach down and pick up that pistola.Shut yer' mouth. Pick it up and bring it over here.Now say 'stick 'em up.'Put the gun down, old timer. You couldn't hit me anyway. Probably shoot the boy. The PHONE RINGS.Leave it be.

Then...You'll get him back. I swear it.We got a handful of caps and yer' shootin' water tanks. He's a smart guy, huh, Phillip? Phillip doesn't move or change expression. Jerry smiles, almost to himself, and FIRES TWICE more for the hell of it. The ROOF of the Impala EXPLODES with two holes as the car speeds off down the highway.You said you had a cousin near here.So give him a call. See if we can shack there til' things cool down. Jerry thinks it over, leans forward and, in one quick swipe, grabs the keys from the ignition. Then he laughs and crawls out on his way to the phone booth.So I won't leave him.Oh yeah. In the b.g. Jerry rips the 20 page phone book in half and returns to the car, half pleased with himself. He tosses the keys to Butch, who starts the car and drives off.What?You were in the middle of threatenin' me.Here kid, take the wheel. Phillip, scared at the prospect, nevertheless does his best to see over the dash and keep the wheel straight. Butch turns back over the seat to confront Jerry.In two seconds I'm gonna' break your nose. That's a threat...... And that's a fact. Instead of expressing outrage, Jerry slinks back down in the seat wearing a look of pure hatred.And that's a threat. Beginnin' to understand the difference? Somethin' catches Butch's eye and he turns and slows down and turns into... EXT. RURAL STORE - DAY The Impala brakes to a dusty stop near the front of the store, which is bordered by a giant hay field. INT. IMPALA - DAYOkay, Phillip, listen up. I'm gonna' run in here and get some smokes.Here, hold it like this.... And point it right between his eyes.If he so much as moves you pull the trigger ... right here... Put your finger on it. Jerry snickers and then laughs maniacally. Butch reaches over and cocks the pistol. Jerry's guffaws stop on a dime.And that's a fact. I believe yer gettin' the hang of this. Butch steps out of the car and heads for the market. INT. STORE - DAY Butch enters. A short fat man with a fishing cap is sweeping up.How-do. Where's yer' sodees?This and a carton of Chesterfields. Are those .38 shells? Gimme a box. The Old Man puts the cigs and shells on the counter and starts to tally the bill on a notepad.Used cars. Buy 'em, fix 'em up. Sold a Cadillac down in Madisonville this mornin'.Thick as theives.You got a phone?Then go inside and lie down til' we're gone. The Old Man meekly does so. Butch goes to the car door, opens it and motions to a frozen stiff Phillip.Well... Get in. EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY The truck and Airstream barrel down the highway. INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY The place is a functioning mobile headquarters now. Adler on the short wave and tacking up a map, Bobby Lee still in his corner, Red and Sally sitting across from one another at the \"kitchen table\".No. Me'n you are friends.If I was choosin' a runnin' buddy, I'd take you over him any day of the week. EXT. RURAL STORE - DAY The RV slides to a stop in the gravel parking lot which is full of state and local police. Red exits first, followed by the others. A LOCAL SHERIFF walks up to greet.Whattaya' thinkin' about?If I guess you tell me? Phillip nods.You thinkin' about yer mama? Phillip sits still. That was it. Butch brings the car to a stop. He points to the horizon. Desolate.I hear ya', Phillip, but look around. I can't very well leave you here, can I? EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY The Impala rests in the fork of a dirt road. INT. IMPALA - DAYLemme' ask you somethin'. You right or left handed? Phillip meekly holds up his right hand. The car races forward.Then that's the way we'll go. You ever ridden in a time machine before? Phillip shakes his head.Sure you have. Whattaya' think this is?Yer' lookin' at this thing bassackwards. This is a 20th Century time machine. I'm the captain and you're the navigator. Butch points forward through the dash.Out there... that's the future. Butch taps on the rearview mirror.Back there... that's the past. If life's moving too slow and you wanna' project yerself into the future you step here on the gas. See? He does so and the Impala surges forward.And if yer' enjoyin' the moment yer' in, well hell, just step on the brake here and you can slow it down.This is the present, Phillip. Enjoy it while it lasts. Then he laughs uproariously and steps on the gas. EXT. ROAD - DAY The Impala spins out, kicking dirt in all directions.Yessir. Time travelin' through Texas! We got to find us a Ford. My daddy always drove Fords, you know that? INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY The Airstream sits in the parking lot of the store. Bradley and Suttle sit up front in the truck. INT. TRUCK - DAY Bradley turns the knob on an intercom speaker system next to the radio.Ok, Phillip, we're gonna do some car shoppin'. You ever play cowboys n' Injuns? See that Ford sedan? Now I want you to sneak on over there like an Injun and take a peek and see if the keys is in it. Phillip hesitates.Don't have to if you don't wanna... but I'd appreciate it... You bein' the new navigator and all. Phillip thinks it over then opens the door and slips out.Hey, Phillip, check for a radio, too. EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY Phillip, still in his skivvies, legs cut up and muddied from his escape from Jerry, sneaks up to the car and quietly peers into the open window. The keys dangle when his small hand touches them. Phillip closes the door, looks around and then runs pell-mell to the passenger window of the Impala.Good man.What for?This here's nature, Phillip. Pee in the ditch. Phillip scrambles to the ditch to relieve himself while Butch steps out of the Impala, tosses the keys into the field and walks toward the Ford.Start, you sonofabitch! The Farmer runs faster, comes closer...Get in the car, Phillip! The Farmer, only 30 yards or so away, is racing toward them madder than a wet hen. Phillip tries to hurry but the RC continues to run through him.Phillip! Get in the car! Phillip pulls his underwear up and races to the car. He leaps into the open passenger door at the same moment Butch steps on the gas and the Farmer arrives and grabs onto the door as it closes. INT. FORD - DAY The CAR is SCREECHING down the road but the Farmer holds on for dear life and auto. He claws at Phillip, who does his best to fend off flailing hands and fingers. Butch reaches under the seat for and grasps the pistol. Phillip sees what's about to happen and bites the Farmer's hand as hard as he can.Goddam, boy, how many RC's did you drink anyway?One thing's for sure. You got one helluva set of chompers. INT. TRUCK - DAY Sitting still. Bradley tries to light a cigarette with the lighter but gets no heat.You got blue eyes don'tcha', Phillip? Never met a blue-eyed Phillip before. Who you named after?You and your old man get along all right?Toss the ball around, play grab-ass in the yard, that sorta' thing?Why the hell not?Well he is or he ain't. When's the last time you saw him? Phillip shrugs.Me'n you got a lot in common, Phillip. The both of us got blue eyes, we both like RC Cola and neither one of us has an old man worth a damn.Well... she's lyin' to ya' pure and simple. He ain't never comin' back. Disappointment registers on the boy's face.Guys like us, Phillip, we gotta' be on our own. Seek foolish destiny, that sorta' thing.Tell him your name.See there! All you gotta' do is say your name and people are waiting on you hand and foot. Like a goddam king or somethin'. Phillip can't help but smile at the notion. EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY Bradley and Suttle lean against the parked RV, chatting.You ready to get out of those skivvies and into some britches? Phillip nods.Well all right then. But first we gotta' come up with some A.K.A.'s, fake identities, ya' know. Names to call each other when we're around other folks. Go ahead and think one up. Whatever name you want.As a matter of fact. Shoes and new skivvies, too. He'll tell you his size. Go with the lady, Buzz. Phillip, still in somewhat of a daze, doesn't recognize his own \"name\".Buzz! Phillip snaps to, cracks a smile at Butch and follows the lady to the children's section of the store.takes a roll of electrician's tape. He tears off a strip, attaches it to the back or his hand and tugs. It holds tight. LUCYWhattaya' think?You folks are about the grinninest bunch I ever seen. Paula laughs, then drops her grin, looks behind her to see Mr. Willits is watching, and whispers...We'll get it next time. Go get in the car, son.pays Paula, then stuffs a $20 in her blouse.You are truly the friendliest clerk I ever met. She blushes a \"thank you\" as Butch makes a hasty retreat to the door.Up to you, Buzz...Here, take them nasty skivvies off and put on yer' jeans. He spots Phillip's not so successful effort to hide the costume box.Whatya' got there?From the store? You kyped it? Phillip nods, expecting the worst.Well, hell, Phillip, put it on.Let's unnerstan' each other here.Stealin's wrong, ok? But if there's somethin' you need bad and you ain't got the money, then it's okay to take a loaner on the item. It's what ya' call an exception to the rule. Phillip tears into the box, rips out the costume, looks at it, starts to take off his underwear then balks. Butch notices.What's wrong?What? You don't wanna' get undressed, is that it? Phillip shrugs.You embarrassed caus' I might see yer' pecker?What?Well hell, lemme' see. Phillip still hesitates.Go on. I'll shoot ya' straight. Phillip gingerly pulls off his underwear. Butch smiles a broad grin.Hell no, Phillip, it's good size for a boy yer' age! Phillip, remasculated, smiles and starts to put on the costume.Here they come.An inch is 24 miles. Hold yer' pointin' finger along the line of the road. You got three lines on your finger, don'tcha'? Each one's an inch. So how many inches to Childress? Phillip holds one finger to the map, then another.Yer' a helluva' navigator, Phillip. A lot smarter than Jerry. But I guess that's not sayin' a lot. Something catches Phillip's eye.Seen one of them in a magazine. It's called a motor home. They're new. Kinda' like a house on wheels. Butch HONKS the HORN TWICE and waits for a retort. INT. TRUCK - DAY Bradley smiles, looks to Suttle, who nods an \"okay.\" Johnson sits on the HORN for TWO solid BLASTS. INT. FORD - DAY Phillip laughs and waves.Phillip, you get in the back seat and lie down on the floor.Hell, I don't know. 'Caus' I said so! 111E INT. TRUCK - DAY 111E Suttle is scared to death while Bradley is loving every minute. The ENGINE starts to STEAM.Hold on, Phillip! 111H EXT. ROAD - DAY 111HStarted this road 20 years ago and it still ain't finished. Appears to me we got a decision to make. Phillip, aka Casper, exits the car and, imitating Butch, leans against the car.It's up to you, Phillip. We can backtrack to the highway or we can try it on foot.It's beautiful!Naw. Just got the one postcard. But anyhoo, back to our present dilemma. You feel like a hike?Can't be more'n, oh, say, fifteen hundred miles. Phillip seems a tad apprehensive about the prospect.Yer' prolly' right. Go give our supplies a check. Phillip returns to the car and emerges with the paper bag once full of soda, candy and jerky. Butch surveys the countryside. HIS POV - PAN COUNTRYSIDE Typical midwest Texas; flat, dusty, barren. A mile or so away sits a home -- a small ranchhouse.How's it look?Rations for one at best. Come on. Butch strides straight into the rocky field. Phillip lingers a moment, then sticks the half eaten moon pie in his mouth and follows, hurrying to catch up. thru thruWe're goin' trick r' treatin', Phillip. Phillip stops dead in his tracks. Butch, sensing that the boy is no longer following, stops, spins and faces Phillip.What?Huh?Trick r' treatin'? Why not?Against yer' religion. What kind of foolishness is that?Now, I'm askin' you, Phillip. I ain't askin' yer' mother and I ain't askin' Jehovah. Do you wanna' go trick r' treatin' or not? EXT. YARD OF FARMHOUSE Butch and Phillip cross the dirt yard and make their way to the door.Ok, Phillip, all ya' gotta' do is knock on the door and when they open it you say 'trick or treat.' Got it?Now, Phillip.Say it again, Phillip.Never underestimate the kindness of the common man, Phillip. Butch reaches up and grabs the phone line, yanks it loose and tosses it aside. INT. AIRSTREAM - DAYYou sure there's no meat in there? Spam maybe, Vienna sausages, anything like that?Well, I bet you can make us some mustard sandwiches, can't ya'?Well go to it. Phillip breaks out the loaf of bread and lays out four slices on the dashboard.Many as you want. Phillip lays out six more slices. The dashboard is now covered with bread. Phillip pulls out the mustard but has no knife. Butch pulls out a stick of gum and hands it to Phillip to spread with. As they drive along they pass a large, happy family picnicking in the dip of a long hill alongside the highway. From the look of their brand-new loaded down station wagon they are on vacation. CLOSEUP - PHILLIP Mesmerized by the family. CLOSEUP - BUTCH Ditto. He pulls his eyes back to the road, notices something. EXT. ROAD - DAY Butch brings the car to a stop near the crest of the hill, sets the emergency brake, grabs the first completed mustard sandwich and gets out, leaving the Impala running.Be right back. Don't be stingy with that mustard now. Phillip nods and continues piling the yellow goop on each of the slices of bread.walks ahead to the crest of the hill, the tallest hill in the county. He takes in the 360 degree view. His eyes settle on... LINE OF CARSStep on the brake! Put your foot on the brake! The middle one!!comes to a heaving halt next to Bob, who is near heart attack himself.Bad brakes.Edgar Poe.She's a beaut, all right. Say, Bob, what with my brake problem and all, I sure would appreciate a lift. Me'n my boy live about five miles up the road here. I can pick up the car tomorrow. They notice the Ford coming back down the hill and squint to see...The brake, Phillip! Step on the brake! Hard!Helluva job, Phillip! Never had a doubt.No trouble at all, Bob. EXT. ROADBLOCK - DAY Bob brings his precious car to a gingerly stop. He pulls out his license, shows it.This will do fine right here, Bob. But I do have one more favor to ask. EXT. ROAD - DAY The entire Family Bob is standing along the roadside, their luggage and belongings by their side. The looks on their faces say it all -- Stranded. Butch hands over the stuffed animal to Patsy, pats Bob Jr. on the head and sticks out his hand to Bob.Just a loaner, Bob. Not to worry. You'll get her back. Bob reluctantly shakes Butch's hand in an attempt to impress upon Butch his most important concern of all...You know I will, Bob. Butch gives a snappy salute and is off to the wagon. INT. STATION WAGON - DAY Butch STARTS the CAR and he and Phillip slowly pull away.Wave, Phillip. Phillip does so. Bob's kids wave back. Phillip starts to giggle.Maybe, but Bob did the right thing. What if he'd put up a fight? I mighta' had to shoot him, and where would that family be then? Naw, Bob's a fine family man and that's about the best thing a fella' can hope to be. Butch floors the wagon and the CAR SCREECHES rubber on the highway. BOBCan't find a Coonass Waltz to save my ass. Hey, Phillip, that stuff you told me 'bout not trick r' treatin' causa' Jehovah... Was you pullin' my leg?What else ain't you suppose' to do?Yer' shittin' me?You ain't never been to a carnival neither, have ya'?Not even one?Cotton candy?Pink.Roller coasters?Seen pictures.You know, Phillip, you have a goddammed red, white and blue American right to eat cotton candy and ride roller coasters.Amen.

STATION WAGON - NIGHT Silence. Butch drives away libidinous desires, Phillip sits quietly, staring straight ahead, now and again stealing a peek at Butch.No. More silence.Jus' barely.Caus' it feels good. Ain't you ever seen your mama kiss a man?It's, well, uh, it's kinda' hard to explain. I know how it musta' looked. Hell, I don't know how it looked.... As Butch's voice trails off silence overtakes the car. After a few seconds Butch seems happy not to have to answer any more questions. Phillip fidgits with the door handle. Several more seconds pass, then...Who?Yeah, Phillip, I love her. Kissed her butt didn't I?You wanna' drive?Jus' kiddin', Buzz. I'm just gonna' stop here for awhile and catch 40. INT. WAGON - NIGHTThings go our way we'll be in Alaska in four or five days. Get the jump on winter.

I swear, okay?Yeah, Phillip?Done proved that ain'tcha'? There's lots and lots of stuff you can do, Phillip. Reach in that glovebox there. See if Bob's got a notepad or something. Phillip extracts a small ringed memo pad.Good old Bob. Can you write?Good enough. Now I want you to make a list of everything you ever wanted to do but wasn't allowed to. Okay?Like... cotton candy.Hell I don't know. It's yer' list. Butch settles in for a catnap. Just as his eyes close...Yeah?... EXT. FIELD - NIGHT Only the dome light and the LOW MUSIC bring attention to the car sitting lonely in the middle of the massive field.Me n' the boy was just catchin' some shut-eye in yer' field.Drove from Texarkana yesterday.Said a mouthful there.Wouldn't want to put you out. 'Sides we need to get back on the road.Aaaayyyyy!!!! Cleve races into the kitchen and the apron strings of his grandmother, Mack's wife, LOTTIE.No harm, Ma'am.Mornin' to ya.We left her at home this time. Boy's night out kinda thing. Butch spots an old phonograph.Say, lookie here. He gives it a spin with his finger and searches through a stack of 78s.Jeezus. Now this is music. You know how long it's been since I heard this.You dance, Lottie?Here, jus' follow me. He takes her in his arms and slowly but surely adjusts her movement to his. After a few rough turns they're not too bad. Phillip can't help but smile as he and Cleve watch and giggle. Butch and Lottie dance, swirling around the room.Oughta be able to. Was raised in a dime a dance whorehouse.No, ma'am. My mama would dance their asses out of the fryin' pan and into the back room fire. Butch spots Phillip and Cleve, watching, giggling.Get on yer' feet, Buzz. You'n Cleve shake a leg.Dance, boys! The little boys do their best to emulate the adults and soon they're laughing and dancing, too. The RECORD STOPS. They all clap and laugh. Butch hears something... The RADIO in the bathroom. INT. BATHROOM - DAY Mack sits, cleaning his fingernails with a Barlow knife as the radio announcer begins a news flash.We'll be leavin' soon enough. I'll kill all of you if you try anything stupid. Mack swallows hard.Come on, Buzz. Time for us to hit the road.Why'd ya' wanna' go and hit Cleve for? He didn't move fast enough for ya', is that it? Or maybe he gets excited sometimes and don't hear everything ya' say? You make me sick to my stomach. Butch spits in Mack's face, then rises and walks over to Phillip and hands him the revolver.Point it at 'em.Point it!Now, son, you wanna' flip? Cleve shakes his head \"no\" between sobs. Butch gently takes the boy and lifts him to a standing position.Go ahead. Put yer' hands between yer' legs. I won't hurt ya'. Cleve turns to Mack and then runs to him. Butch walks calmly over and pulls the crying child away from the old man and back to the center of the room.He don't trust ya' no more. You gotta' earn that, ya' know? Put yer' hands 'tween yer' legs, son. Cleve, still sobbing, does so. Butch reaches down and flips him, all the while staring at Mack. Each time he flips the boy, Butch reaches down, grabs Cleve's hands and flips him again. Finally he allows the frightened child to go to Mack and Lottie.Buzz. Go out to the car and get that rope. Phillip stands frozen.Phillip!... Phillip slowly rises and walks away. He stops for a moment and turns his back. EXTREME CLOSEUP - PHILLIP His eyes lock in a gaze with... EXTREME CLOSEUP - CLEVE His sobbing eyes plead for something, anything.Now you hold that boy and tell him you love him. Mack grabs Cleve and sets him in his lap.No, old man. Say it like you mean it.Then say it.Nome', I ain't a good man. Ain't the worst neither, jus' a different breed. EXT. HOUSE - DAY Phillip is at the screen door looking in. He holds the bag in his hand.Say it, Mack. Don't cost nuthin'.Gawd that's beautiful. Butch spots Phillip standing at the entrance to the living room with the bag. He takes it from the boy, empties the contents -- candy, cookies, bread, sugar and all -- and picks up the rope, takes Mack's Barlow knife from his pocket and cuts off a long shank. Butch takes the rope and begins to tie up the three.You can go wait in the car or you can watch. Yer' old enough to think for yer'self. Phillip, unsure what to do, stands his ground.Shut yer' eyes, Cleve. Mack, you and Lottie hold the boy tight. Shut yer' eyes, too. Phillip, awkwardly aware that he's going to witness an execution, starts to cry out, then squelches himself. Butch seems to be in another world now -- taken to another place and time. A slight smile finds its way to his face, then disappears.Shhh... shhh... shhh...Shhh.. shhh...Phillip?....Thanks for yer' hospitality. And walks away. EXT. HOUSE - DAYPhillip?!... No answer. He drags himself to the station wagon and, with much effort, slides himself into the seat. No keys. He opens the door, crawls out, leaving a trail of blood, looks out to the road and starts to walk.makes his way onto the private dirt and starts walking back toward the main road.Phillip?!! I won't hurt ya', I swear!That was a helluva' thing to do, Phillip. You're a hero. Prolly' be in all the papers tomorrow, how you saved those folks. Truth is, I don't think I woulda' killed 'em. I only killed two people in my whole life. One hurt my mama and one hurt you. INT. LEAD PATROL CAR - DAY Adler listens in on the shortwave.What say we talk this over? Settle things man to man. Then we can be on our way. I'll even let you drive. Knock that right off yer' list. How'd that be?Alaska, Phillip. Wild and wooley. Man against nature. Me personally, I like them odds. Did I tell you my daddy lives there? He's the one that sent the picture postcard. Listen here to what he says about it... Butch pulls the postcard from his back pocket and reads...'Dear Robert'... that's my real name, Phillip. Robert. Jus' like old Bob the family man. 'Dear Robert, I just wanted to tell you that me leaving has nothing to do with you.' Phillip, still afraid, can't help but listen as Butch suffers through his memories.'Alaska is a beautiful place. Colder than hell most all the time.Someday you can come and visit and we'll maybe get to know each other better.' Short and sweet. That's the old man's style. 'Cold all the time' -- like that's a big sellin' point. He laughs to himself.He useta' pat me on the head and tell folks 'that it's some that can live life without askin' about it and it's others has to know why, and this boy here is one of the latters.' That's why I wanted to go up there. To visit the old man, I guess. Prolly' punch him one first, but then maybe we'd end up bein' friends, sit down, have a beer, talk things over.... Butch groans. He pulls his hand from his side. Blood is oozing all over the place. He returns the postcard to his pocket.We'll jus' rest awhile. Then you can make up yer' mind. How's that? Phillip, still clinging to the tree, can't help but feel compassion for his friend. EXT. MACK'S HOUSE - DAY A dozen Highway Patrol cars now sit in the driveway. The Fed in charge, AGENT HENDRICKS, assigns different officers to secure the area in an incredibly organized fashion. Mack, Lottie, Cleve and Arch watch from the porch. EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAY Butch's eyes are closed. A small puddle of blood drips and becomes a rivulet running down into the creek. Phillip, still in the tree, still watching, can't bear it any longer. He slowly climbs down and drops next to Butch, who opens his eyes to the boy and smiles.One thing's for sure now -- I definitely believe in ghosts. Never been shot before.I know ya' are. Truth is, if it had to happen, I'm glad it was you. As opposed to someone I don't know, I mean. All things considered, I feel pretty good, though. Could use a beer, though.Oh, it's about the best thing there is. You'd better put that on the list. Phillip's eye catches something. He stands up fearfully... HIS POV - TWO MORE PATROL CARS lights spinning, rushing down the road, kicking up dust. INT./EXT. RED'S PATROL CAR - DAY Sally watches Red. When the car comes to a stop, she reaches out and touches his arm.Naw, Phillip, I need me a time machine with a loud radio to take me where I'm goin'. Walkin's for squares. EXT. MACK'S HOUSE - DAY Red exits his patrol car, followed by Sally. Agent Hendricks walks up.All this for me. I'm touched, but I'm afraid ya'll gonna' have to back it up a step or two. I'm headed to Mexico. Lyin' to 'em, of course. EXT. ROADSIDE - DAYBeer. What'd I tell ya'. Appreciate the offer, Cap'n, but ya' know I can't do that. If you and yer' pals back outta' here, I'll drop the boy at the border. If you don't I'll shoot him in the head. I mean it! Phillip, betrayed beyond comprehension, stares at Butch.Don't look at me like that. I don't even have a gun. What did ya' do with the pistola' anyway?Good thinkin'.See, Phillip, dreams do come true. There's yer' rocketship.Today's the day.What's wrong, Phillip?Now that ya' got yerself a ghost suit, do ya' think she'll let ya' trick r' treat?Put yer' mask back on. EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY Bobby Lee carefully unsnaps the latches on his leather case and opens it on the hood of the patrol car.You ready to go home?Hey, Cap'n, you got any candy? INTERCUT BACK and FORTH BETWEEN Butch and:Candy! Halloween candy! Popcorn balls, caramel apples, gum, shit like that?!You find me some candy and I'll deliver up a ghost.One more thing. His old lady has to swear to take him trick r 'treatin' every year. Phillip strains to look for his mom. He's upset, ready to leave.Gimme' yer' list, Phillip.Gimme that list. Phillip pulls it out. Butch snatches it and reads it to himself, laughing. He's on a death roll of sorts, between losing blood and being in an impossible situation he almost seems to be enjoying the macabre scenario as it unfolds. Phillip, on the other hand, is beginning to sob.And she's gotta promise to take him to the fair for rollercoasters and cotton candy whenever he wants... or at least once a year...And when he gets older he gets to drink beer...Well it's on yer' list. And to go out on dates with girls! Not on the list, but you'll thank me later for that little addition. Done that, got to drive, gonna' ride that rocketship. That's about it. She's gotta' promise or I won't let him go!Don't kid a kidder, Phillip. EXT. ROADSIDE -DAY Red, exasperated, he can't believe how weird this has gotten.Make her say it! Red looks to Gladys as if to say, \"go ahead\". She seems reluctant. Red's frustration is showing. EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAY Phillip is near tears. He rises and starts to move for the field, but Butch grabs him with one arm, pulls him close and holds him like he's his own child.Know jus' how ya' feel, Phillip.Make her say it!Can we trust her?When you get home, hide this. If she's lyin' you can buy yer' own damn beer. Phillip quiets for a moment and stares at Butch.Yeah. Now, Buzz, listen here. I want ya' to step out there real slow, keepin' yer' paws in the air. Then strut right over to them cops and yell 'trick r' treat.' Got it?Somethin'll come to mind. Butch sticks out his hand. Phillip shakes it, afraid.'Bye, Phillip. It's been one helluva' ride. Butch nods and smiles.All right, Cap'n. Make way for Casper the friendly ghost. The friendliest ghost I know. Butch nudges Phillip and the boy starts toward the field. EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY Adler, looking through binoculars, can't help but smile.Personally I think we negotiated a pretty fair deal, but if there's somethin' else you want...So I guess that's it for Alaska, Phillip. EXT. ROADSIDE - DAYIf I had a pistola I'd be headed the other direction. My partner here got rid of the evidence. Do I know you, friend?Hmm. Well, look I wanna' talk to the boy and then we'll take care of bidness. How's that? Only take a second. Red nods then looks over his shoulder at the patrol cars lined up like a wagon train, guns aimed, Bobby Lee peering through the scope of his rifle.I wanna' give ya' somethin'. EXT. ROADSIDE - DAYMebe' someday you'll get to go... EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY Hendricks looks through the binocs.tastes blood and sighs.Damn, Buzz, shot twice in the same day. He collapses and falls into Phillip's arms. Phillip backs away two steps and falls to his knees. Butch wavers for a second then topples on his back. Phillip moans, sobs, as he watches Butch, the GUNSHOT stillHis eyes don't close, still squinted but frozen.

out.You'n'me must be livin' right, Butchie boy!Who said I liked you? Butch slides down and hangs from the ledge before dropping on the roof of the building below. INT. ADMIN OFFICE - NIGHT A SOFT THUD causes a Guard to look up, but only momentarily as he spots Larry departing, files in hand, waving goodbye.Gawd I'd love to blow yer' head off.'Night, Larry. 16A INT. SMALL, WELL-LIT DINER - NIGHT 16A A weathered finger drops a quarter in a jukebox.Hey, wait up! Jerry's feet scurry through a pool of blood and past a quivering hand. INT. D.P.S. - TEXAS RANGERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT It's very late, after midnight, and only a handful of people, half of whom are cleanup crews, shuffle through the offices. A light from an office at the end of the hall catches our eye. A MUFFLED VOICE over the phone...There's a Buick.Ford's leak oil. A car's a car. Butch puts on the brakes and brings the car to a stop.Soon as we cross state line I'll do just that. I'm tired of riding around. I'll check down the block... for a Ford! Jerry gets out, slams the door, lights a cigarette and walks away. Butch waits a few seconds, quietly turns the key one notch and checks the gas ggauge. It reads almost empty. He taps it with his finger but it doesn't budge. He sighs, looks up and sees...as he checks one locked car, then feeling eyes on his back, turns, looks at Butch, grins and disappears around a corner. BUTCH discreetly exits the car himself, carefully closing the door without a sound. INT. PERRY KITCHEN - NIGHT Gladys steps into a slip and snaps her bra while cracking eggs into a skillet. By rote she salts, stirs, and pops bread into the toaster.I take mine fried. INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT Gladys gasps at Jerry's face pressed against the screen, but controls herself when he brandishes the pistol. He motions for her to open the back door. She does. He slides into the room and sits down at the table. EXT. ON STREET - NIGHT A Ford sits in a driveway. In the far b.g. a back porch light glares. Butch ENTERS FRAME, looks at the light, turns to the Ford and starts to jimmie the lock. No luck. He rises and looks to the light. INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT Jerry stuffs a piece of toast in his mouth, grins at Gladys and makes a motion to the counter.A lil' on the bland side. Gimme' that ketchup. She picks up a bottle of Heinz and inches toward him. When she gets close, he grabs her and forces her onto his lap. He holds the gun to her throat and whispers in her ear.Don't got a man around here, do ya'? 29A INT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT 29A MR. CUMMINGS, 70, puts on his glasses and peers through the window.Feed me, sweet thing. Her shaking hands raise a forkful of eggs to his lips. He licks them once then gobbles with gusto. Phillip enters the room and stops dead in his tracks.Well lookie here, you do got a man! Jerry smiles at Phillip while he kisses and licks Glady's neck. At once, Phillip darts across the room at Jerry, who backhands the boy with his gunhand, sending Phillip sprawling. Butch blasts through the door in an instant. With a swift kick to the head, Jerry is knocked senseless onto the floor against the cabinets. The gun slides across the floor and lands at Phillip's feet.I'm bleedin'! You happy? Butch gives Jerry an icy stare and kneels down to eye level with Phillip. Butch looks at the gun and then at Phillip.Give it to me.You deaf?!!!We gotta' get the hell outta'here!Shut up! In one fluid move he rips the phone from the wall. The silence is deafening.I vote we bring her with us.How we gonna' get outta' here without a hostage, tell me that? The whole goddam neighborhood's awake.Ain't you folks ever heard of sleepin' in?!! EXT. PERRY YARD - DAWN Cummings races from behind the house with the SHOTGUN, levels it and FIRES a BLAST... A nearby station wagon WINDOW SHATTERS. Rising from their cover position, its owners look at Cummings with disgust.Why the hell we stoppin'?So?Musta' moved. Prolly' couldn't have heard 'em anyway. Goddam ear's still bleedin'. You ever try that shit again...What?Ain't a threat. It's a fact. Butch reaches over, takes Phillip's hand and places it on the steering wheel.I'm gonna' kill you for that.Get beer.What the hell?...Yer' a fuckin' crazy man.You ever shot a gun before, boy? No answer. Phillip steals a glance at the store, anxious for Butch to return.Powww!!!... It'll knock you on your ass.Naw. You ain't never shot no gun before. Livin' in a house with three split tails... no Daddy around. You'll prolly' grow up queer, you know that? A bead of sweat rolls down Phillip's cheek.Now I'm gonna' lean up here real slow, okay? So we can talk. Jerry raises his hands, palms up and slowly leans forward in the back seat. Phillip's hand quivers but he doesn't pull the trigger.There we go. Now we can have a 'man to man.' You are a man, ain't ya'?Those are cute little underwears you got there, boy. Say does your mama sew yer' name in 'em, initials or anything? Jerry's hand slowly reaches down to the white briefs. He places one finger in the front elastic waistband and slowly pulls it open.Whatcha' got in there? Jerry sneaks a peek.Kinda' puny, ain't it? Phillip, diverted, looks down. In a flash Jerry grabs the gun.The hand is quicker than the eye. Jerry flicks open the revolver, spins it -- empty slots.That sonofabitch. Hell's bells, no shells. INT. STORE - DAY The Old Man puts down his broom and ambles to the register.Come over a little closer. As Jerry groans, Phillip seizes the moment and bites Jerry hard on the ear. Jerry screams and drops the gun, which Phillip picks up and carries with him as he scurries out of the car and into the hay field. Jerry, in pain, now with both ears bleeding, crawls out of the back seat and gives chase.no longer stumbling, now grinning maniacally, gives chase, whistling as if calling for a lost puppy.I'm gonna' find you boy.

It was better yesterday.I don't know.Couldn't sleep. Whattaya got?Yeah. Lemme talk to him.And how are you guys doin'?Hayden, this is Red Garnett. We worked together a few years back. Mind if I come in? The YELLING inside STOPS and the door opens a crack. HAYDEN, 35, distraught, peers out.Leave it to the P.D. They got a three- ring circus out there and not one cup of hot coffee. You mind? Hayden mulls it over, then opens the door.Appreciate it. Jus' what is it you want, Hayden?What'd they suspend you for?You love her? Love the kids?Naw, Hayden, I don't think so. I think you love her. You know what else I think? That you'd like a way out of this whole mess... That's where I come in. 16E EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT 16E Sergeant and other cops stand around and watch the house.Hits the spot. Hayden starts to sob a bit. Red hands over a handkerchief which Hayden accepts.Okay. You ready? Hayden nods, they stand. Red picks up his hat, sticks it on his head, opens the door and holds it for... Hayden, transfixed by the multitude of lights outside. He gulps.We'll walk out together, okay? Hayden steps back, looks at Red, then reaches behind his back, underneath his shirt and pulls out a .22 pistol.Lemme have it, Hayden. Hayden points the gun at Red, freezing him.Yeah. Hayden smiles.I understan' your concern, Johnny. INT. RED'S OFFICE - NIGHT Red, behind a huge ranchstyle desk covered with files and paper, sips coffee with one hand, works a buffalo nickel through magician's paces with the other and balances the phone receiver in the crook of his neck.Cons are creatures o' habit. Like old coyotes, they'll crawl back into familiar holes. Uh huh... Yeah... Sure yer' right. Listen you go back to bed and I'll call you in the A.M. with an update. I'll have the files by then. Say hullo to the Mrs.. Red sighs, puts the PHONE back in the hook and stares at it until it RINGS again. INT. PERRY HOUSE - NIGHT The CLANGING wind up alarm CLOCK reads 5:30 and Gladys opens her eyes and gently quiets it with a touch. She groans and rises, not happy but used to the daily ritual required of her.Yes, Johnny, I do understand that... The jabbering on the other end of the phone line continues as Red's eyes squint to read the files. INSERT - FILES The first is Jerry's, complete with a grinning mug shot in the upper right hand corner. There are several pages in the file, but Red's fingers quickly peruse the top rap sheet before turning to... INSERT - SECOND FILE It's Butch's and again Red's fingers start to move down the page then they stop and move to the photo of Butch at the top of the page.keeps staring at the photo, oblivious to the phone conversa- tion he's \"not having\".Huh?Yeah, Johnny. Jus' thinkin' is all....Yeah.... Clear as a bell... Mi' sabe. Red hangs up the phone, takes a draw on the coffee mug and looks again at the file. He seems lost in time.Who?Reminded me it's an election year. Red turns his attention to Sally.You drink before noon?Good. Last one I had was on a liquid diet.Secretary.Adler... what is this? Adler searches the messy desk for something.Who sent?...... 'to work with State law enforcement officials in all affairs where penal matters coincide with those of the State Police.' It don't say nuthin' about...In the first place, Miss Gerber.In the first place, Sally, it ain't a 'penal escape situation.' It's a manhunt. Fancy words in a circle don't help much.A nose like a Blue Tick, a medulla with an antenna and one helluva lot of coffee. And with that he's out the door. INT. PRESS ROOM - DAY A throng of photogs and news writers stuff the undersized room. The clamor settles when Red enters and steps behind the lectern.Listen up, I'll only say it once. At approximately ten o'clock last night two inmates over to Huntsville, Robert 'Butch' Haynes and Jerry David Pugh, escaped through an air shaft, grabbed a prison employee's car and got out through the main gate. At approximately 1 A.M. we believe they robbed a market outside of Cut-n-Shoot and killed the store's owner. REPORTER #1 Is the prison employee with them?Was when they left the prison. Sally and Adler enter the room and stand beside the lectern observing. Red notices them.Long as Christmas eve to a kid. Haynes was doin' 40 for armed robbery and Pugh was ridin' 20 hisself for manslaughter and assorted parole vios. REPORTER #3 Is there any indication of...... Lemme' finish, Billy. This mornin' another hostage was taken... from a private home in Madisonville. A boy, age 8. Grabbed him out of bed. REPORTER #1 Any sex offenses on Haynes or Pugh?Yer' askin' if they're preverts. Well, one is. REPORTER #4 You got inter-agency cooperation on this?Texas Rangers as the criminal investigation arm of the D.P.S. share responsibility with the F.B.I. due to the kid being taken. But I doubt they're out of bed yet. A few chuckles.Officially I can only say we have a full manhunt team on their trail and we'll proceed with due haste. REPORTER #3 And unofficially? Red hesitates a moment, something's bothering him, then blurts out...Unoffically? I'm gonna' hunt 'em like the rabid dogs they are.That's all I've got but I'd like to introduce ya' to Miss Sally Gerber. She's straight from the Governor's office. Knows all about psychological profiles and the like. You probably have some questions for her. Red steps back and to one side. Sally is taken aback but then warms to the idea and steps to the podium for her first press conference, ready to take on the tough questions, to show off a bit, but....Look, fellas, I got work to do. And he heads out the door, followed by Sally's eyes and every reporter's in the room, who commence once again to yell out questions and mob after the Chief. Every reporter, that is, except one. He's near the back of the room and he smiles and raises his hand. Sally, unsure what to do, looks to him...So I hear.Fine piece of machinery.We'll take it.Guvner' hisself told me this manhunt was top priority.Who are you?Not anymore. Bradley. BRADLEY, 35, glasses, moves to the truck and gets in. Suttle shrugs and steps out. Saunders stops Suttle and turns to Red.You know how to operate the gadgets?Grab a seat. Suttle sets himself in the passenger seat of the truck. Sally emerges from the building, ticked off, carrying an armload of file boxes, and makes a beeline for Red. Saunders gently touches Red's shoulders; a final plea.Tell John that Miss Gerber here checked me out on it. Red whistles and the ENGINE REVS. Red closes the door as the motor home pulls away. Saunders runs beside the passenger side window and yells in to Suttle, who stares out the window.You comin' or not? She hesitates only a moment before walking straight to Red, grabbing back her file box and entering in front of him.All right. Push the roadblock on 288 north by 50 miles. Kaiser calls in the instructions.Hell, I dunno'and neither do they. They're jus' happy to be out. It's a high speed Sunday drive to them.Somethin' eatin' at you?You got somethin' to say, spit it out.We don't have a dilemma. And neither do they. They'll keep one hostage... and get rid of one, if they haven't already.If there's a SNAFU, who's John Q. Public more likely to give a rat's ass about -- an innocent boy or a goddam bureaucrat. Red wipes the water off the spoon on his shirt and walks to his office in the back. Adler, Bobby Lee and Kaiser chuckle lightly at their boss's snubbing of the female upstart in their midst. Sally's face glows a bright red. INT. MOTOR HOME - BACK OFFICE Red sits in his office chair, pulls out the spoon and pours Geritol from a bottle into his coffee. He doesn't even look up when Sally enters, a stern look on her face.Call me Red.I'm hell-bent on one thing. You hang around long enough you'll find that out. Til' then a tough backside and a sense of humor will get you through a lot.Awful. Arthur Godfrey says it keeps ya' young, but I'm not sure it's worth it.This yer' first time out of an office? She refuses to answer.Thought so. What'd ya' expect ya' signed on for? Adler, Bobby Lee and Kaiser all watch the discussion, smiles on their faces. Sally abruptly closes the door.Didn't ask that. Asked what you expected.I happen to like the Governor, hunt quail together every year. But deep down he and I know that win, lose or draw this is my ship, not his.... Bullshit. Responsibility lies with the one that loses sleep; the one with the most ulcers. This mess turns bloody -- and it might -- all it's gonna cost the Governor is a few votes! Me, I'm the one that's...Tell ya' what. You think I'm makin' a wrong turn you speak up. Might not agree, but I'll listen. As far as stepped on toes and wounded pride, I'll buy everyone a drink when we head for home. Not until. I got more to worry about. That sound fair to you?Well okay then. Sally turns, about to leave.So who's the other one?If yer' one brain, who's the other?We got a positive I.D.?Least now we know who's in charge. INT. IMPALA - DAY Butch notices that Phillip is pretty somber as he tugs on another RC.Sooner or later he'll get on a main road. We don't got the manpower to roadblock every farm to market.Let's sit tight. He'll turn up. EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY The Impala travels slowly along the road until it edges to a stop by the entrance to a small farmhouse with a truck and car parked in a long dirt driveway. A farmer on a combine works a small field.What kinda' shape's it in?Beef up the I-20 roadblock. Adler gets more news through the headsets.No. Adler looks quizzically at Red and pulls off the headphones...Tell 'em what I said.I don't want some half-ass Sergeant York taking pot shots with a deer rifle. Adler puts the headphones back on. Bobby Lee smirks a bit.The third eye Pugh's sportin' on the way to the morgue shouts otherwise. Sally flashes Red a look back. Bobby Lee rises and moves past Red on his way to the toilet.Yeah. I gotta' hunch. INT. FORD - DAYYou got the keys to this thing?Get me a crowbar. You might wanna' wait in the boat.Well.... THEIR POV - OPEN TRUNK In it lies the crumpled, bent, bloody remains of Larry, the prison employee, the original hostage.... there's our bureaucrat.It's sure nice to know the boy's in good hands. Sally straightens herself, ready to bite back, but Red's face is soft. He offers a handkerchief. She takes it.Gallows humor, Sally. Without it we'd all be heavin'.Holy Jeezus, they're a team.How'd ya' kill him?Turn this thing around! Adler jumps on the radio to the truck.Holster that firearm and get yer ass back inside! Bobby Lee thinks it over, shakes his head in disgust and holsters his piece. 111G INT. FORD - DAY 111G Butch spots an opening and...What?Don't tell 'em that. INT. GOVERNOR'S OFFICE - DAY A large group of very serious advisors sit and stand in a circle around the Governor's desk. Across from GOVERNOR CONNALLY sits a nervous, near tears GLADYS PERRY. An AIDE on the telephone, turns to the Governor.Tell 'em to come and get it. EXT. DUSTY FIELD - DAY Butch continues his hell-bent brisk pace in the field of dirt clods. It's all Phillip can do to keep up.Yeah. Adler moves to set down the mike and topples a cup of coffee. It spills on the floor. Suttle grabs a towel to wipe it up but realizing the futility of keeping the Airstream clean, he simply throws it aside.What? EXT. AIRSTREAM - DAY Bobby Lee finishes his whittling, blows away shavings, smiles at his creation, sets it on the rock, gets up and walks away. CLOSEUP - HIS CREATIONTell 'em stand by. We got the best seat in the house right here. Have the southern roadblocks call in the dogs and move north. Check every road, every farm from San Angelo to Sweetwater.Well goddam, shout at Amarillo. Tell 'em we got a notion he's headed their way. Adler gets right to it.Truth is I wish he'd cross the border so we could turn this over to the feds. Nobody in the room expected to hear this.I got work to do back home. Red rises and stretches, walks to the open door and stares out at the late afternoon light.I'm hungry. This thing got any food?That so? INT. STATION WAGON - DAY Butch fiddles with the RADIO. He settles on a Spanish station playing a BALLAD and ADJUSTS the VOLUME.How you take your steak, Sally? Bobby Lee and Sally both look up to see Red standing in the doorway.A woman after my own heart. She takes this opportunity to slide between Red and Bobby Lee on her way into the main room. As she goes...I'll just wipe its ass, herd it through and you can cut off a hunk. How'd that be?I don't give a damn who you work for. You're here for one reason and one reason only.Yeah. Yer' in my office. The hot line PHONE RINGS... Bobby Lee flinches first and moves back into the main room. Red follows.Nuthin' as impolite as callin' at the dinner hour. INT. DOTTIE'S CAFE - NIGHT Phillip, at the booth, plays with the parsley on his empty plate, which sits across from Butch's barely touched one. The boy looks over his shoulder and sneaks a peek at Butch, who sits at a barstool watching Eileen work behind the counter.Figger to give 'em another hour of shuteye, then grab the patrol cars and head for the Panhandle.Too many. Red turns to her. They both know he's divulged something.They got a file on me, too?Just caus' it's written down don't make it true.Yeah, well, that's definitely the worst of it. Red uncorks his thermos and refills Sally's mug. She takes a sip and almost chokes on it.The file don't tell ya' that, too?I got a ranch I never visit, nieces I hardly know, a tackle box full of dry lures and a dog that figures he's the owner and I'm the pet. Could have a point, he's there more.Liked to have wet those lures. Maybe a new dog. How'd you get into... whatever the hell it is you do?That explains your mouth. Sally smiles.What's yer' husband think about all this?Yer' not careful you'll wind up jus' like me. Old, tired, with nobody around to love ya'.It's crazy ain't it?Goin' without sleep chasin' after a three time loser and Casper the Friendly Ghost?Bite your tongue.What's your file say about him?There are murderers I'd trust with my mother and petty thieves I wouldn't turn my back on. Your precious files are wrong.Hayne's old man was a career criminal with a soft spot for whores. One way or the other he beat the hell outta' every person he ever crossed, screwed or fathered. Judge sends junior home with the old man and you can bet your last dollar that within a year he'll have a rap sheet as long as yer arm. I know kids who did Gatesville, made it through, shaped up. Hell, one's even a priest. Sally realizes she's opened an old wound.-- This job ain't about files and books and second guessin'. Ya get one shot and ya call 'em like you see 'em.In Texas the bottom line is who ya' know and what they owe ya. That's how I do my job and how you got yours. He turns to walk inside.I bought the judge a T-bone and told him to send the boy up. Told him it was the right thing to do. He went along right down the line. Red disappears. Sally just stares after him, her face once again soft. INT. STATION WAGON - CLOSEUP - MEMO PAD - NIGHT resting on Phillip's lap.Let's head on over towards Amarillo. We'll cross him there or wave goodbye at the border. INT. MACK'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY Phillip sits on the couch and watches as Butch shows Cleve a trick. Cleve bends over, puts his hands between his legs and Butch grabs them and pulls -- a flip. Cleve is ecstatic at the result. Phillip and Butch laugh along.How far?Get on the radio and tell whoever gets there first to play it nice and easy. Sally gives him a look.Jeezus, who did that?Go ahead and chopper her in. After a moment of silence, Sally turns to Red.Yes, ya did.Funny thing. When the judge sent him away the kid stared at me. Like he knew. Not hard or mad like you'd expect. It was... It was like he was forgiving me.Naw. For what's gonna happen today.Yeah. You got the area quadroned off?You got him spotted?You got any problem with me handling this one?Let's head on down there. Bradley, gimme' a megaphone.Yer' shittin' me. EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAY Phillip scoops a handful of water and brings it to Butch, who opens his mouth and drinks, A megaphoned voice interrupts...Butch, this is Red Garnett of the Texas State Police. A thin, knowing smile crosses Butch's lips.I know yer' hurt. We've got damn near 100 armed men here. Take a look around and you'll see I'm shootin' ya' straight.Hate to tell ya', Butch, but yer' headed the wrong direction. Tell ya' what. You let the boy go and we'll talk about it. Discuss it over a cold beer. EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAYWhat do you think?One thing's for sure. If he gets outta' here with the boy, we're right back to where we started.All right, both of you, that's enough! From the trail of blood I got a feelin' it ain't gonna' make any difference. Let's jus' concentrate on gettin' the boy out for now. Bobby Lee approaches with a leather case, bypasses Red and goes straight to Hendricks.Can you shoot off a hood? Bobby Lee nods. In the b.g., a HELICOPTER circles, preparing to land.Bring her on over. EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAY Butch and Phillip watch the helicopter land.Butch, we got the boy's Mama here. She wants to say something. Phillip is visibly stunned by the news. He crawls up to the crest of the creekside and squints, looking for his mom.Jus' push the button and talk normal. It SQUAWKS again.Here, I'll hold the damn thing. You jus' talk.Yer' doin' fine. We'll get another one.Well, find another one! Red sighs and cups his hands around his mouth.What?!You hungry?You heard him. EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY Red nods to Adler who starts to gather sticks of gum, mints, anything from the surrounding officers.You all set?You got yer'self a deal. Candy's waitin'. EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAYIt's a deal!What kinda' foolishness is that? She promises!Gimme' them things. Adler hands over the binoculars. Red takes a look. HIS POV - PHILLIP nee Casper, walking in his full whitehood, arms reaching for the sky.Come on. Keep walkin'! HIS POV - THROUGH BINOCS Phillip stops walking and stands perfectly still.Why the hell's he stoppin'? Call for yer' boy to come! Gladys, near shock, AD LIBS commands to Phillip. \"Come on honey,\" \"Phillip, keep walking,\" that kind of thing. EXT. FIELD - DAY Phillip turns back and sees ... Butch -- He tries to get up in an attempt to make a run for it, but his strength is gone. He collapses. Phillip, standing still, with his mother's shrieks filling the air behind him, watches Butch for a second then runs back toward him. EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY Red sighs and lowers the binocs. EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAY Phillip stands before a struggling Butch.Stay on ready. EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAY Phillip holds his hand out and helps Butch get up. Butch stands, dusts himself off, grabs the boy's hand and to- gether they walk toward the field.I seen it all now. EXT. FIELD - DAY Butch and Phillip, hand in hand, walking across the field. EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY Red scratches his head.Hell if I know.Butch! Stop and let the boy go! Put yer' hands up and let the boy go!!!Stop and put your hands on your head!You clean?Keep him locked down. Don't squeeze til' I say 'when.' Red holds Bobby Lee's eyes until the young Fed nods. Then Red unstraps his holster and moves between the cars.I'm unarmed. Toss your gun on the ground.No... not really.I didn't say 'when.'I don't know nuthin'.

has been waiting almost an hour, Red. Red nods then notices someone at the door and motions her in... SALLY GERBER, 28, cute in a plain, no nonsense way, with giant curls accenting her round face in step with the latest hair fashions, enters the room, closes the door behind her. She's nervous as hell but trying to hide it. Red motions her to have a seat while he finishes his call.What'd he say?The Guvner', Red. Red closes the file.Penny Munroe.Rings a bell, Red. Believ' they sent us something about her this mornin'...... Guvner', Red. Adler finds the telex message sheet he's looking for and hands it to Red.... Here it is.Tom Adler. Deputy. State Police... System.On our way, Marge.Gettin' antsy, Red. You scheduled it. Adler hangs up, grabs Red's tie and coat from a brass rung on the wall and hands them over. Red puts down the telex, stares at Sally and reluctantly attempts to make himself presentable.All right, that's it, boys. Chief's got work to do. Red and Adler move through the parking lot to SAUNDERS, 50, an aide to the Governor. Saunder's seconds are a PHOTOGRAPHER, young and energetic, and SUTTLE, 35, dark-haired, with a cowlick. Saunders shakes Red's hand and they turn to gaze upon...S'cuse me. This here's Bobby Lee. He's a specialist with the Feds. They want him to tag along. Red stares hard at Bobby Lee, then nods. Bobby Lee steps into the Airstream.Got a spot on 'em. A store right outside of Benhur. About 20 miles from here. Adler sets down the mike, sticks a tack on the map and stands back.Ya' figger' they're that far along?Sunday drive. I like that. Never heard you use that one before, Red. Sally is watching Red and listening to all of this with a troubled look on her face. Red notices...What makes you so sure they won't stay together? Sally hesitates. Red notices...What about the hostages? They gonna' flip a coin to see who gets to keep who? Red rises and walks to the sink. He rinses a spoon.That oughta' put his pecker in a sling, huh, Red? Sorry, ma'am.In a perfect world, Miss Gerber, we'd lock arms and thrash the bush til' he turned up...Locals are heading out. Wanna' follow?Highway 16 north. Four miles south of Desdemona. Got it. Stole a vehicle. Kaiser radios up front, the ENGINE STARTS and the Airstream moves.What's that?Owner told the locals they only drove it to church, but it does have a bad emergency brake. How'd ya' know it was a Ford?Looks like you was right, Red. He's off the farm to market and onto a spur. Whattaya' wanna' do?What's that? Red, the locals wanna' know if they're to take a clean shot if they get one? Red stares out the window for what seems like an eternity...Uh... no.No, er, yes. No means negative. Same thing. Over. Red sees Sally peering at him over the top of her file. He glances around at the other sets of eyes.They've forwarded the stolen vehicle license to the roadblocks. You still wanna' go to the farm? Red pulls out a package of Red Man chewing tobacco and mulls over the question while he slaps a wad into his cheek.No bodies this time, thank Gawd.Uh... naw...They've got him penned down in Noodle, north of Abilene. INT. FRIENDLY'S - AT COUNTER - DAY Paula bags the items, including the jeans. CLOSEUP - WILLITS staring straight at Butch. CLOSEUP - BUTCH shakes his head at Willits -- \"Don't even think about it\".Haynes bought tape, rope, and some clothes for the boy. Red comes to and turns to Adler. Sally smiles almost to her- self. She was right -- Haynes is looking after the boy. Everyone knows it, but no one says anything.One puzzler though. They say the boy could have gotten away but didn't.That's not all. The kid stole a Halloween outfit.With the pit stop in Noodle looks like he's headed for the Panhandle. Red sighs and groans. Unpleasant news but somehow he knew it. He moves to the back room for another shot of Geritol.There's more roads than people in the Panhandle.But if anybody knows them backroads it's Red. Sally lifts her head, watches Red reenter the room, then stares out the window.What's she doin', Red?What'd the authorities do?They didn't even stick him in juvy?What happened?Yeah? Kill somebody else?That's where the son-of-a-bitch learned to be a criminal. Seen that before, ain't we, Red? Red doesn't answer. He seems in a faraway place.I believe it was Casper... Casper the friendly ghost.Turn it around! That was them! EXT. ROAD - SAME TIME The Airstream slows to a grind, pulls off the narrow shoulder and begins to make a wide U-turn.Uh... Red?They wanna know if the boy looked okay?Spur 208 northbound. And 83 at Aspermont coming and going. That it?They've got two Highway Patrol cars they can give to us now.He knows he's hemmed in. I predict we'll have him singing a different tune by nightfall. EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY The red station wagon creeps along the highway to the whistled strains of \"Old MacDonald had a Farm.\" INT. STATION WAGON - DAY Butch, truly \"singing a different tune,\" whistles \"Old MacDonald.\" Bob joins in and soon the whole damn Family Bob is whistling the tune. Bob's daughter PATSY, 5, red hair, freckles, starts jumping up and down on the back seat, singing and spilling her drink.He got through! At Aspermont.Coerced a motorist. Red sighs.Got T-bones in the frig, Red!-- And look, Red! Tater Tots! Those kind you like! Red turns and looks.That's the Governor's line, Red! Red calmly walks past Sally who smiles a \"thanks\". He gives her a one finger to the hat salute, walks to the phone, reaches down and yanks out the cord. The RINGING STOPS.Guvner, I assume.Ya' think he means it? Red mulls it over, replaces his old chaw with a fresh one and looks to Sally.Shit, he'll get the chair anyway. He's killed two in two days.Well he wasn't at home in his Strat-O- Lounger. 'Sides, who killed Pugh? Casper?That'd be the boy's mother.He's gonna make a run for it.I thought he had a gun, too, Red. There was just no way of knowin'. Red doesn't even look at Adler, just keeps walking. Adler stops, his eyes following Red. Sally, nearby, watches Red walk away.", "clean_line": "red talkin ya press waiting hour red red nods notices door motions sally gerber cute plain nonsense way giant curls accenting round face step latest hair fashions enters room closes door nervous hell trying hide red motions seat finishes guvner red red closes file penny munroe rings bell red believ sent mornin guvner red adler finds telex message sheet looking hands red tom adler deputy state police way marge gettin antsy red scheduled adler hangs grabs red tie coat brass rung wall hands red puts telex stares sally reluctantly attempts presentable right boys chief got work red adler parking lot saunders aide governor saunder seconds photographer young energetic suttle dark haired cowlick saunders shakes red hand turn gaze cuse bobby lee specialist feds want tag red stares hard bobby lee nods bobby lee steps airstream got spot em store right outside benhur miles adler sets mike sticks tack map stands ya figger far sunday drive like heard use red sally watching red listening troubled look face red notices makes sure won stay sally hesitates red notices hostages gonna flip coin gets red rises walks sink rinses spoon oughta pecker sling huh red sorry ma perfect world miss gerber lock arms thrash bush til turned locals heading wanna follow highway north miles south desdemona got stole vehicle kaiser radios engine starts airstream moves owner told locals drove church bad emergency brake ya know ford looks like right red farm market spur whattaya wanna red locals wanna know clean shot red stares window like eternity uh er yes means negative thing red sees sally peering file glances sets eyes ve forwarded stolen vehicle license roadblocks wanna farm red pulls package red man chewing tobacco mulls question slaps wad cheek bodies time thank gawd uh naw ve got penned noodle north abilene int friendly counter day paula bags items including jeans closeup willits staring straight butch closeup butch shakes head willits think haynes bought tape rope clothes boy red comes turns adler sally smiles self right haynes looking boy knows says puzzler boy gotten away kid stole halloween outfit pit stop noodle looks like headed panhandle red sighs groans unpleasant news knew moves room shot geritol roads people panhandle anybody knows backroads red sally lifts head watches red reenter room stares window doin red authorities stick juvy happened yeah kill somebody son bitch learned criminal seen ain red red answer faraway place believe casper casper friendly ghost turn ext road time airstream slows grind pulls narrow shoulder begins wide turn uh red wanna know boy looked okay spur northbound aspermont coming going ve got highway patrol cars knows hemmed predict ll singing different tune nightfall ext highway day red station wagon creeps highway whistled strains old macdonald farm int station wagon day butch truly singing different tune whistles old macdonald bob joins soon damn family bob whistling tune bob daughter patsy red hair freckles starts jumping seat singing spilling drink got aspermont coerced motorist red sighs got bones frig red look red tater tots kind like red turns looks governor line red red calmly walks past sally smiles thanks gives finger hat salute walks phone reaches yanks cord ringing stops guvner assume ya think means red mulls replaces old chaw fresh looks sally shit ll chair killed days wasn home strat lounger sides killed pugh casper boy mother gonna run thought gun red way knowin red look adler keeps walking adler stops eyes following red sally nearby watches red walk away"}, "SALLY": {"raw_line": "Uh... no.Last what?I believe you have me confused. I'm here from Huntsville. Assigned by Governor Connally. Red is confused. He turns a blank expression to Adler.Uh, I'm Sally Gerber. Criminologist with the State Prison System. Sally offers her hand. Red, perusing the telex, ignores but Adler shakes somewhat reluctantly, not sure if he's supposed to like her or not.It's a relatively new procedure but I was assigned by Governor Connally...... It includes parole and work release programs as well as penal escape situations. The office PHONE BUZZES. Adler picks it up.The idea is that an understanding of the particular behavioral case histories should, in parole situations, help the subject to avoid habitual traps and, in penal escape situations could, conversely, identify those self-same traps as an aide to apprehension.Sally, please.And what does?You have a question?I've got it. She kneels down to pick it up and feels eyes on her. She looks up to the men staring at... Her skirt, raised a bit, exposing a thigh. She calmly stands and looks to Adler, a piece of cinnamon roll dangling on his chin.You've got shit on your face. Red can't help but smile as Adler wipes at his face. EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY The IMPALA BLASTS along, kicking up dust and dispersing crows as it heads into a one light township. It slows, however, before the main part of town and slides to a stop near a pay phone booth. INT./EXT. IMPALA - DAYIt's... perhaps premature, but do you have an auxiliary roadblock plan for when they split up? Everyone stares. No one ever questions Red.Their situation is one of accommodation. They won't be together long. Silence. Sally continues.Haynes and Pugh are opposites. Haynes is a criminal's criminal -- armed robbery, mano y mano confrontation. Pugh, on the other hand, has a rap sheet littered with molestation and petty crime. They'll split sheets soon.It's happened before. Either way it's a dilemma they'll address soon. That's why we should address it now. She looks to Red. He refuses to return her gaze.Okay... which one?We need to talk, Chief Garnett.Red. Why are you so hell-bent on embarassing me?I have a fine sense of humor, but the one thing I won't do is be your straight man so you can play hero to a bunch of morons who think you're some kind of hillbilly Sherlock Holmes.I'd like an answer.You think I'm what? Some dumb schoolgirl who wandered into the boy's locker room? Well you're wrong. I don't mean to boast, but I happen to be one of the two most intelligent people involved in this fiasco.I expected to be allowed to do the job assigned to me by the Governor.The Governor as chief executive officer of this state bears ultimate responsibility for...You're the one that what? But Red side-steps.Yes.Other one?Haynes. He was tested in prison. INT. IMPALA - DAY Butch drives and catches an occasional glance at Phillip who sits quietly, but who, too, steals looks at his captor between swigs of RC Cola. He finishes off the bottle. Butch reaches in the sack for another, pops the top on the dashboard and hands it to Phillip.Shouldn't these be roadblocked as well? She points to several other unmarked roads.In a perfect world things like this wouldn't happen in the first place. Adler hears something on his headset, turns to Red.The Ford he stole.He likes Fords.It's the only thing to do. He's got the child with him. Red gives her a look that says, \"Don't defend me\".Maybe, maybe not.I'll give you a safe bet. The boy's in better hands now than he was.No thank you. 76A INT. TRUNK - DAY 76A But it's black as night. A CROWBAR CRANKS at the lock until the trunk blasts open like a bottletop. A blast of light gives way to the silhouetted faces of Red, Adler and Sally, who turns and walks away in nauseous disgust.Probably scared to death.What?How's that happen?Okay, so... I'm Robert Haynes. Called Butch by everyone. I was born in Amarillo, but grew up in the French Quarter of New Orleans.I killed a man when I was eight. Silence. Nobody seems willing to play along. Red turns from the window to Sally.Shot him with a pistol. There was always one around the dance hall. That's what they called it but it was a whorehouse. We lived there. Red moves away from the discussion and stands at the front of the Airstream, staring out the front window.The victim was wanted by the locals so the whole thing got shoved under the carpet Cajun-style.Put me in school. Three years behind but I catch up.They were. For awhile. When I'm twelve mom dies.Delilah Jane Haynes hung herself in the bathroom of the brothel. Could have saved herself the trouble. Post-mortem check uncovered last stage syphilis.Nobody knows where he is now. Ditched when I was six. He was a small-time felon. Popped up again after Mom died -- he'd just been paroled. Moved us back to Amarillo. A year later I'm in trouble again.Took a joyride in a Ford coupe that I just couldn't resist.Judge gave me four years in Gatesville, toughest juvy farm in Texas.Where I'm going isn't as important as 'Why am I going there?'staring out the window. She looks at the passing Ford.That was them. They just passed us.Shit!!!!He was laughing and waving.Excuse me?Excuse me. Bobby Lee smiles a crooked-tooth grin, refusing to move.I could give a shit.Uh.. rare.Maybe medium-rare. Bobby Lee and Red are left standing face to face.Bring back any memories?It's the 60's, Red. They've got a file on everybody.You worked as County Sheriff in Amarillo and Austin before you became a Ranger. Right so far? Oh, and it says your name's Cecil.Strong... but good. So Cecil... Red gives her a strong look.Red. What do you do when you're not at work.Nope.A confirmed bachelor. Any regrets?My father's defense lawyer.Instead of Home Ec, I studied Criminology. When I graduated, my father, with the Governor's help, they, he and my dad... I created a position for myself with the prison system.Don't own one.Maybe.What's that?Sleep? That's what retirement's for.You wanna' know what's really crazy? Hayne's juvenile court record lists you as Amicus Curiae. Silence save the CRICKETS.Friend of the court. Evidence given by a non-party with the intention of swaying the judge one way or the other. They're usually in written form, but there's no copy attached. Red doesn't flinch.Okay, then at least tell me why Haynes got four years for a joyride? What about probation? The boy had a home, a father.That he was a petty thief who did a little time, got out and stayed pretty clean.I'm listening.Still, I don't understand from the file why...I'm a bit confused... Red tosses out the rest of his coffee.What are you trying to say?Not a bad idea.I didn't mean to pry last night.Look, Red, it was 20 years ago.Forgiving you for what?! For looking at the facts and doing what you thought was right?I think our chances of this thing ending peacefully are good. He smiles a lonesome smile, opens the door and exits. EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAYNo doubt an observation based on personal experience. Red can't help but smile.Based on what's happened the past two days I don't think he would.We don't know that he pulled the trigger on either of the innocent victims.It doesn't necessarily mean that.He's giving himself up.Come on, come on...Give it a second!Let the boy go, Butch!Noooooo...!!!!You did everything you could. You know that.
