{"Election": {"TRACY": {"raw_line": "None of this would have happened if Mr. McAllister hadn't meddled the way he did. He should have just accepted things as they are instead of trying to interfere with destiny. You see, you can't interfere with destiny. That's why it's destiny. And if you try to interfere, the same thing's going to happen anyway, and you'll just suffer.Good morning, Mr. McAllister.You know what they say about the early bird.Thanks, Mr. M.No matter what he says, Mr. McAllister had it out for me from the start. Oh sure, he was all smiles and good wishes and everything, but underneath he was just as unfair and petty as anybody else.He'll probably tell you how committed he was to teaching and democracy and integrity and all. Don't be fooled.I know.Ethics are...Some people say I'm an overachiever, but I think they're just jealous.My Mom always tells me I'm different -- you know, special. And if you look at all the things I've accomplished so far, I think you'd have to agree.Here I am in Oklahoma.I'm just a girl who can't say no...And here I am on KMHS, our student-run TV station...that's why Principal Hendricks made the controversial announcement that the littering must stop. Tracy Flick reporting.But it was in SGA, the Student Government Association, where I made my biggest mark. I never missed a meeting, and I volunteered for every committee as long as I could lead it.I agree with Ashley. We should rent the barrels at least a day beforehand. What happened last time was a travesty, I mean, we were --...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...YOU probably think the worst - that Mr. Novotny was just taking advantage of one of his students, but it wasn't like that at all. Our relationship was based on mutual respect and admiration. I mean, during my sophomore year in geometry it was strictly professional between us -- I mean, nothing.It wasn't until junior year when we worked together on the yearbook that things got serious.One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.what?No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.What do you mean? What kind of person am I?Thank you.Since I grew up without a dad, you might assume psychologically I was looking for a father figure.But that had nothing to do with it at all. It was just that Dave was so strong and made me feel so safe and protected.It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.When I think back on my relationship with Mr. Novotny, what I miss most. is our talks....certain time in history andNow that I have more life experience, I feel sorry for Mr. McAllister.I mean, anyone who's stuck in the same little room saying the exact same things year after year for his whole life, wearing the same stupid clothes, while his students go on to good colleges and move to big cities and do great things and make loads of money has got to be at least a little jealous. It's like my room says - the weak always try to sabotage the strong.One thing that's important to know about me is that I'm an only child. So my Mom is really devoted to me, and I love her so much. She wants me to do all the things she wanted to do in life but couldn't.See, Mom used to be a stewardess for Northwest and now works as a para-legal. She likes to write letters to successful women like Janet Reno and Elizabeth Dole and ask them how they got to be where they are and what advice do they have for me, Tracy, her daughter.Nine times out of ten they say you have to hold on to your dreams no matter what. The pressures women face mean you have to work twice as hard, and you can't let anything or anyone stand in your way.One per person! Put those back INinety-seven.. .ninety-eight.But you know, winning isn't everything. If you play fair and follow all the rules thoroughly, you'll always come out ahead. Win or lose, ethical conduct is the most important thing. Just ask Mr. McAllister.Mr. McAllister? Mr. McAllister! Wait upI got all my signatures. One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!Here they are.Could you approve them now? I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.Aren't you supposed to keep them?I thought you were supposed to keep them.Thanks for everything.I can't wait to start campaigning.Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year. And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure....harmonious and productive... close and special... you and I... so close... so intimate... together...The right side is too high. The right side. Just a smidge.Who put you up to this?Who put you up to this?You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?Thought what?So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.Okay, Mr. Popular. You're on.You might think it upset me that Paul Metzier had decided to run against me, but nothing could be further from the truth. He was no competition for me: it was like apples and oranges. It just meant I had to work a little harder, that's all.You see, I believe in the voters. They understand that elections aren't just popularity contests. They know this country was built by people just like me who work very hard and don't have everything handed to them on a silver spoon.Not like some rich kids who everybody likes because their fathers own Metzier Cement and give them trucks on their sixteenth birthday and throw them big parties all the time. They don't ever have to work for anything.They think they can all of a sudden one day out of the blue waltz right in with no qualifications whatsoever and try to take away what other people have worked for very, very hard their entire lives. No, it didn't bother me at all IFuck me, Mr. McAllisterYou're the advisor. You should stop her. She's not qualified. She's just a sophomore.Are you sure all her signatures are real? It's not easy to get all those signatures.Let me see them. Let me see themThese are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.Tim Kobza? Tim Kobza! Who's he? I've never heard of him!Poet Henry David Thoreau once wrote, \"I cannot make my days longer, so I strive to make them better.\" With this election, we here at Millard also have an opportunity to make our high school days better. During this campaign I have had the opportunity to speak with many of you about your concerns. I spoke with freshman Eliza Ramirez, who told me how alienated she feels from her own homeroom. I spoke with sophomore Reggie Banks, who said his mother works in a cafeteria and can't afford to buy him enough spiral notebooks for his classes. I won't bore you with long- winded promises about all the new and innovative things I will definitely achieve during the year in which it will be my honor and privilege to represent each and every one of you, but I can say that my years of experience on the student council have taught me the three most important attributes the president needs to possess; commitment -The three most important attributes the president needs to possess are: commitment, qualifications, and experience. I'll add one more; caring. I care about Millard, and I care about each and every one of you, and together we can all make a difference. One of the things I would like to establish is a regular open forum where any student can come and voice their concern about issues we face here at Millard. I and the rest of the student council would then interface with the faculty and staff, so a continuous dialogue would exist.When you cast your vote for Tracy Flick next week, you won't just be voting for me. You'll be voting for yourself and for every other student Our days won't be any longer, but they can sure be better. Thank you.What happened at the speeches was an unconscienceable travesty. That little bitch Tammy Metzier wanted to make a fool out of me. Well, it wasn't going to work. People do care who wins. Things do matter.Eric, the \"r\" is supposed to be green, not blue.That's okay. I'm too busy.People are so ungrateful. If all those students who cheered for Tammy Metzier only knew how hard I worked for Millard. Like all the late nights I spent at the yearbook office just to give them their memories.One of my duties was to clean up the group photos. It was a cinch with our new software.Let's see... \"save\" is Command \"S.\" Okay.I didn't do this. I didn't do it.When I arrived at school that morning, I was shocked to find that one of my key banners had been removed by vandals. I noticed that a few of my rival's posters had also been tampered with. Of course, I was outraged, but one day before the election is not the time to lose your head over a couple of posters. When you're in the public eye, attacks like that just come with the territory.If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious. I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications. I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down. Did I do that too?I was. So? Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.I don't. I just know they were there when I left. I'm giving you helpful information is all. You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.well, I don't know. It could have been anybody. There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard. You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs. Or Doug Schenken - what about him? Or what about Tammy Metzier? Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.Why are you lecturing me?I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.And I think certain older persons like you and your \"colleague\" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant. And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.This ought to be goodYes?What do you mean?I told you! I told you! You're going to pay for my banner!Dear Lord Jesus, I do not often speak with You and ask for things, but now I really must insist that You help me win the election tomorrow, because I deserve it and Paul Metzier doesn't, as You well know. l realize that it was Your divine hand that disqualified Tammy, and now I'm asking that You go that one last mile and make sure to put me in office where I belong, so that I may carry out Your will on Earth as it is in Heaven. If elected I promise that I will pray more often. Okay? Amen.Mom and I got up at five AM, and together we custom-iced three hundred and fifty cupcakes.Mom?I think I'm going to lose todayYou really think so?Good morning, Mr. M.Looks like you could use a cupcake!What's wrong with your eye? Are you OK?When the time came to cast our votes, I stood in line just like everyone else.Tracy Enid Flick.Phil you ready?Just wait.Thanks, Phil.Yeah.Good luck to you too, Paul.You know that moment when they announce the winner of a beauty pageant? When Miss Texas or whoever suddenly realizes she's Miss America, and all she can do is scream and weep and hug the losers? I had my moment in the hallway that Tuesday afternoon with no one to hug but myself.Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.Yeah.Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium. Be modest. Thank them for this incredible honor.One vote... one voteSenior year was very productive for me and full of personal achievement.Order. Order. Order I Can we vote on this? Those in favor.On top of a very successful student council year, I got into Cornell like I wanted, with scholarships, and I was in the top 7th percentile of my graduating class.But sometimes I got lonely, and I'd think about Dave. I missed our talks. Maybe it could have worked out between us. I don't know.I wonder what he's doing now. Maybe he finally finished his novelWhen the yearbooks came out, I was on almost every page.Paul, will you sign my yearbook?Can I sign yours too?I thought very carefully about what to write. Because despite everything that had happened with the election, I really wished him well. I even signed it...Yes, Paul?Thanks. You too. It was great working with you.After graduation, I don't know. ; somehow felt empty inside. I guess high school just seemed so meaningless now and I couldn't wait to get out of Omaha. Next year I was going to make all new friends. Smarter, more ambitious friends. It was time to move on. There was nothing left for roe here. I just had one more thing to take care of.Hello, Mr. M.I'm looking at new cars.My mother's buying me a new car for college.Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.Sporty.Where to?Yeah.Uh-huh.That sounds good.Yes?Doing what?Nooo. I just thought... l mean, I am looking for a new car. But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends. And then things would be different. Don't you think?I've got an idea.My house.I want you to do something for me.I just have to get something. I'll be right back.Would you sign it for me?Take as much room as you wantI'm scared, Mr. M.

Tracy?Yes, I do.Well, good luck there, TracyIt's hard to remember how the whole thing started, the whole election mess. What I do remember is that I loved my job. I was a teacher, an educator, and I couldn't imagine doing anything else.The students knew it wasn't just a job for me.C'mon, wolverines! Defense! Let's hold 'em back!I got involved. And I cared.And I think I made a difference.I knew I touched the students' lives during their difficult young adult years, and I took that responsibility seriously.In the twelve years I taught U.S. History, Civics and current Events at Millard, I was voted Teacher of the Year three times - a school record.Standing in front of a room full of young people, trying to make them think that's how I wanted to spend the rest of my life,So would this be an ethical situation or a moral situation? What's the difference between ethics and morals, anyway?AnybodyDerekYou're on the right track, who can help him out?Michelle?Or a life experience. Good. And ethics?Okay. But we're still missing something key here. What are we missing?Tracy.Tracy Flick. Tracy Flick. I've never met anyone quite like Tracy Flick.She first showed up in my life as a freshman delegate in student council. I'd seen a lot of ambitious students come and go over the years, but I could tell right away Tracy Flick was different.It wasn't long before everyone knew who Tracy Flick was. She made sure of that. Her drive was astonishing. Even scary.Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body. And so far she was running unopposed.Oh. There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.A few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny.Don't tell me that. I don't want to know that.Dave came to Millard the year after I did, and we hit it off right away. We backed each other up in teachers' meetings and shared an interest in 60's music and micro-breweries.You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.Our wives became best friends too. And when Dave and Sherry's son Darryl was born, they asked us to be godparents.You did it at your house? Your own house?In love?But you haven't written your novel.Dave, I'm just saying this as your friend. What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop.That was just talk! Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts? We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code. The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.I'm not talking about ethics. I'm talking about morals.I guess I don't have to tell you how all this turned out.sits on the vinyl sofa.After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.Okay. We'll pick up here next timeHey, that's superYou can put those in my box. I'll look at them tomorrow.RightLooks good to me.NO, that's fineOkay, fine. SureYou bet.Should be easy. So far no competition.Yeah. Okay. well, good luck TracySureGood luck, Tracy.I don't blame Tracy for what happened with Dave. How could I? Dave was an adult more than twice her age.Sure, she got on my nerves once in a while, but I admired Tracy. I really did.Thank God for Diane. She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through. After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever. And the secret? Good communication.Everything's fine. Just, you know, school.Paul.Paul, could I talk to you for a minute?Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.I know. I understand disappointment. I really do.But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity. I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.Let me give you a clue. You're a born leader. You're one of the most popular students at Millard. You're honest and straightforward. You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside. The other kids look up to you. What does that spell?Student... council... president.Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.Yeah. But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.Paul, what's your favorite fruit?takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.Okay, let's sayFine. Let's say all you ever knew was apples. Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.Exactly. So what do you say? Maybe it's time to give a little something back.Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.He likes it.Diane really wanted to have kids -- and so did I -- but it seemed like there was always a reason to wait: she had to finish nursing school, I had to get my masters, we needed a new house, we needed more money. Finally we just decided to go for it......but for over a year we hadn't had any luck. And Diane was getting desperate.Yeah, uh, just a minuteYeah, just --Sure.Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.Here?Okay. Give me the drill.I'd always liked Sherry, but we'd never had a chance to spend any time alone together. How with Dave out of the picture, I began to see what an incredibly sensitive and giving person she was.Plus she had finally dropped all that weight from her pregnancy, and really she looked great.We got to be pretty good buddies. I even took her to the mall one time while her car was in the shop.You look greatOh, come on. You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time. Let go; live a little.So what do you think? Should we get a room?points at the motel.Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.Yeah. No. I mean, you know.Well, Sherry's great. But she can be a little much sometimes.So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.... that is, until things started going all haywire with that damn election.Calm down, Tracy. Just calm down.As far as I know, they--Anyone who gets signatures in on time can run. And she got in just under the wire. Nothing I can do.Looks like Tim Kobza.Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy? We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.Thank you, Jerry, and good luck. Again, Jerry is running unopposed for Vice President. So we'll move on now to the presidential race with three candidates running. The first in alphabetical order is Tracy Flick.The next candidate for student body president is Paul Metzier. Paul?Okay, Paul. Now our final candidate for President - another one of the Metzier clan -- sophomore Tammy Metzier.Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech. That's not what student government's about.I think that's a little strong Walt. Ron?There's your culpritShall we give it a name?No, I... uh, didn't know thatStill clear?We'll let it run awhileRight now?Three twenty-five.What had blossomed between Sherry and me was too real, too powerful to deny. For the first time in years, I felt free and alive!So as you can imagine, my thoughts weren't on the election that Monday morning.My thoughts were only on Sherry, on how perfect she felt inside. There was a special poem I wanted to read to her later, at the motel, as she lay next to me.Nowhere. I don't have class until second period.What's the problem?Oh yeah, you bet.is inside.Tracy. Come on in. And shut the door behind you.I guess you know why you're hereA travesty. Huh. That's interesting, because I think you did it.Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?6:30. How do you know what time the posters were torn down?Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it? Whom should we \"interrogate?\"You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities. But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that. And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake. I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences. You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.I agree. But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.Okay, Tracy. Have it your way.Just wait outside. Tammy.Possibly. Please just wait outside.Tracy, don't go away. Come in, Tammy.So... what do you have to tell me?What is it. Tammy?Looks at her skeptically doesn't say a word.And when did you do it?Exactly when?And how did you get in the school?Which door?I don't believe you.Final I don't know what your problem is, but if that's the way you want it, that's the way it'll be. I don't have time. You're out of the election, and I'm turning you over to Dr. Hendricks.Tracy?Looks like today's your lucky dayYou're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.That's enough, Tracy. Quit while you're ahead, okay? I'll handle this. Could you ask Walt to come in?The rest of the day was unbearable. I kept smelling Sherry on my clothes and on my fingers and I just couldn't wait to get out of there.I wanted everything to be perfect that afternoon, so I decided to give myself a little time to prepare during eighth period.Pop quiz, everybodyNo whining. If you've done your reading, this is an easy one.I'd have exactly forty-eight minutes to make all the arrangements.If you finish early, just sit quietly and check your work. I'll be right back.Okay, everybody, pass them forward. Stephanie, put down your pen.I'll see you all on Wednesday. And don't forget to vote tomorrow.Sherry ISherry I It's Jim!SherryOww! Fuck! Jesus fuck!By any chance, has a woman shown up in the last half-hour or so? Maybe she was looking for me.Are you sure?Sherry, it's me. Are you there? Pick up. Okay, it's 4:32. I came by at 3:25 like we said and waited, but you weren't there. Anyway, I hope you're okay -- I'm worried about you. So now I'm just at the... at the place we talked about. Suite 219. So I'm here. Everything's all set. You can just come over. Can't wait. Okay. Bye.OkayAs I walked out of my home that evening, unsure if I'd ever return, my entire life in question, I somehow discovered within myself a place of perfect peace. Oddly, in my solitude I felt more than ever a sense of communion with every human being - past, present and future. Because no matter what we tell ourselves, no matter what illusions of friendship and family we create, each of us is always and forever profoundly alone.Sherry never came home that night. I know, because I spent the entire night in her driveway.I had no choice but to go home. I needed to shower, get fresh clothes, explain what I could to Diane. But what was I going to say? That our marriage had become a charade? That making love with Sherry had given me a vision of a better life?Then again, maybe I could slip in and out without waking her up.Cupcakes. Jesus Christ. Cupcakes? My life was crumbling, and I was expected to care about these ungrateful kids and their pathetic little dreams. As if my only purpose in life were to serve them.Mr. McAllister. Mr. McAllister. Somebody tore down my posters. It's not fair. It's not fair. Can I have an A? Can I have a recommendation? Can I? Can I?Well, fuck them. Didn't I have my own life? Didn't I have my own dreams?CupcakesOh, yeah. Big day.Are you there? Sherry, are you there? It's Jim. Why did you do that? I trusted you. Completely. You've ruined my life. Do you know that? Do you realize that? Huh? Do you? You've ruined Diane's life. You ruined my life. is that what you wanted? I'm sorry. It's just... I'm going nuts here. Okay, all right, so... Really, I'm sorry. I just think we should talk, okay? I love you.If only my own life could be corrected so easily, with nice fat black lines drawn neatly through my sins.What? Right. So let's start counting.Fine. So do your count. Start with president, and I'll be right back.Right. I know.I'm fine. It's just a bee sting, a simple little everyday bee sting. Some people, they get stung, it's no big deal. Me, I swell up. Okay?I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period. I have other things going on, too, you know.All right. I'll be backYou're there.Sherry... I love you.It's the only true thing I know anymore.A mistake? That was no mistake.Me? I took advantage of you? You hugged me! You kissed me! You're the one who --What d'you got?You're kidding, right?Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won.Huh. Okay. Well, I guess I'd better do my count.I was at the end of my count when it happened. I'd come up with exactly the same numbers as Larry: Tracy had won the election by a single vote, 256 to 257. I was about to announce my tally when...The sight of Tracy at that moment affected me in a way I can't fully explain. Part of it was that she was spying, but mostly it was her face. Looking at her, you might think she was a sweet, innocent teenage girl. But she wasn't sweet. And she wasn't innocent. She was selfish and cynical and ambitious and thought nothing of destroying the lives of others to get to the top. who knew how high she would climb in life, how many people would suffer because of her? I had to stop her now.Larry?I think we've got a problem.Mostly Tammy fansHe's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -If we could get started. People! Once the winners are announced, we can all go home, okay?Some contests are so well fought that is seems unfair for someone to win and someone to lose. I think that's the case with all the candidates you see before you today. All of them are highly qualified and embody the, uh, the integrity we expect from our school leadership.That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done. We'll begin with president.Let me add that this was an extraordinarily close race. It's my pleasure to announce the next president of Millard High School.Paul Metzier!And now, for vice-president.Could I get a...?JIM McAllister.Paul doesn't need any of my help. He's going places. You should be very proud.Just a bee sting.Thanks, I'll be fine.Oh, she's not a bad girl. She'll come around.Good school.Oh, no. No. I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.You bet.Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later. A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.Don't worry about Tracy. She'll be fine.Diane, I...I don't know how Diane and I made it through that night, but we did. Our marriage had gone right to the brink, but in the end I guess it was saved by one simple fact: we truly loved each other. So we made a commitment to begin the painful process of piecing our lives back together. The worst was over; the mistakes of the past were behind us.The next day held the promise of a new beginning. After all, what harm had really been done? No one was dead.Hi, Linda.Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.Hmm?Oh. Okay.You rang?After Paul got the bad news, Walt asked for a few minutes alone with me. It was very simple, really. I offered my resignation, and he accepted. Very quietly, it was all over for JIM McAllister at Millard High - twelve years of hard work down the drain.Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.I don't remember driving home, or much of anything that happened in the next few days.There were news stories in the paper and on television, former students calling with their support, endless hours of doing nothing, thinking nothing.Diane stood by me through the entire humiliating ordeal, in a way, it sort of evened things out between us.Soon school was over, and summer stretched out in front of me as it always had. Funny how the rhythm of the school year remains ingrained in you for life. in mid-June we found out Diane was pregnant.After two months of sitting on my ass and two months helping out at my brother-in-law's travel agency......I landed a position at a Saturn dealership.I never thought I'd end up selling cars, but it's not so bad. I like the Saturn philosophy -- it really is a different kind of company.I'm just relieved to have a steady income now that there are three of us.Actually, it wasn't so difficult making the transition from teaching to selling. It's like I tell my customers: my role is just to educate people so they can make informed decisions.When I send someone home with a new unit, I feel a genuine sense of pride.So that's about it. Maybe I'll get back to teaching someday, but for the time being, I guess I'm pretty happy where I'm at.OhHello, Tracy.So what brings you here?Oh. New cars. I see. Well, you came to the right placeHuh. Right. College. Wow. Where are you going? Where 'd you get into?Good for you. Good for youSo, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?Anywhere you want. Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.Handles pretty good, don't you think?Plenty of pep, too.And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.So Tracy?Why are you doing this?Coming to see me. Are you trying to. . humiliate me?Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.What's this?I don't understand. What's the deal?Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.Oh, is this...? God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.What a surprise.You'll be fine.You will.", "clean_line": "morning lowelltwenty wasting time tracy yes good luck tracyit hard remember thing started

{"raw_line": "Stop daydreaming! Get back to work!Why. . . ? Why. . . ?I was so mad at God when I broke my leg at Shadow Ridge over Christmas break.The doctors told me I'd have to quit sports for at least a couple years if not forever....which meant no first-string quarterback in the fall. It was like the end of my life!When I got back to school everybody was so supportive, and they all wanted to sign my cast and everything...... but I still couldn't shake the feeling that now my life had no purpose. What did God want from me?Why did I exist?Sometimes you can search everywhere for answers. Then one day destiny just taps you on the shoulder. I know, because it happened to me.Mr. McAllister changed my life. And no matter what they say he did or did not do, I believe he is a good man.I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it. And maybe go on to...Yeah.What do you mean?Who, me? Nooo. I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --And she's super-niceHuh? Oh. Uh... pearsNo, wait -- apples. Apples.I also like bananas.I gotta talk to him first.Huh? Oh, hi, TracyWhat do you mean?No. Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and... It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best. I just thought --Paul... Paul... power... Paul... Paul for President... progress... promise... peanut... Paul-i-tics... yeah... President Paul... Punt for Paul! No.Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.Yeah. So guess what happened. So Mr. McAllister, he -- Oh hi. Lisa.So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --What'd I do?I sure was surprised the day Lisa Flanagan asked me for a ride home and ended up blowing me.Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.Life is so weird. First Lisa has a big fight with my sister, and the next thing you know she's my girlfriend.Since Lisa knew all about public relations and stuff, she offered to help me with my campaign. We made a great team!It seemed so natural, the two of us together. It was like destiny.That spring was perfect. My leg wasn't bugging me too much, and the weather was so nice. And every afternoon after school. Lisa and I would go to her house to fuck and have a swim. It was like we were in a world all our own.Tammy? Tammy, what are you doing?We can't both run, can we? We're brother and sister. Can we?For what?For what?As many of you know I broke my leg pretty bad thi3 year and the experience has made me reevaluate what I want to do with my life and that is help people when you think about it a school is more than a school it's our second home where we spend all cur time and grow as individuals and a community but is our school everything it could be I want our school to reach its true potential that is why I am running for president.I know what it is to fight hard and win like when we almost went to state last fall and I threw that fourth-quarter pass against Westside for the touchdown that won the game by three points I won't let you down like I didn't then I promise we can all score a winning touchdown together. Vote Paul Metzier for president thank you.Oh. Hi, Tammy. I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -Yeah. Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything. But that's okay, you know. l respect your privacy. I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister. Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.Okay. Great. I feel good.Oh. Oh. Yeah. Right. One other thing. Since you know Lisa so well, could you give me some advice? I want to get her something for helping me with the election. You know, something really special -- like flowers or candy or flowers and candy. Or is that too typical? I mean, can you think of something? Something really special? You know, something she'd really like?I just don't think anybody would do something like that on purpose. It must have been some kind of mistake. Like a maintenance thing.We still have some extra ones, don't we? Maybe we can just --Oh, no, hey. Like I said. Tammy wouldn't... she...Dear God, thank You for all Your blessings. You have given me so many things, like good health, nice parents, a nice truck, and what I've been told is a large penis, and I'm very grateful. But I sure am worried about Tammy. In my heart I still can't believe she tore down my posters, but sometimes she does get so weird and angry. Please help her be a happier person, because she's so smart and sensitive, and I love her. Also, I'm nervous about the election tomorrow, and I guess I want to win and all, but I know that's totally up to You. You'll decide who the best person is, and I'll accept it. And forgive my sins, whatever they may be. Amen.Way to go, Tracy! Isn't this exciting?Hell, good luck!Thanks!It's so weird. DO people always just vote for themselves? 'Cause looking at my own name on the ballot, I just... I don't know, I just felt like it's not right to vote for yourself.Hey, Mr. M. Big day, huh?Yeah, you too, Tracy. I'm just glad it's over.You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time. She was always super- nice to me.Geez, you guys, thanks a lot. I mean, wow, thanks. I promise to do my best and really do a good job and be a good president. And I want to thank Lisa Flanagan for being a super campaign manager. And I just want to say that I think Tracy would have made a great president too and that she really deserves a big hand.Wow! Mr. McAllister! This is so wild. We came to celebrate my victory, and I can't believe it. Here, these are my parents.This is great.I never would have ran if it wasn't for Mr. M.Yeah!Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.So, Mr. M, I was starting to think about ideas for next year. I was thinking it would be cool to have, like a carnival. With rides. And, you know, it could be for, like. Muscular Dystrophy.And on Halloween we could have a haunted house. But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones. You know, more like the radio station ones. This one would be really scary. And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -Oh, okay. Yeah, sorry.Just one more thing. So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.Huh?Senor presidente. Yo soy senor presidente... El grande presidente...I don't know why, but finding out there was a mistake and I hadn't won the election after all didn't bother me that much. Winning had seemed kind of unreal anyway. I guess I should have voted for myself. Oh, well.Is Tammy okay?Senior year was great I Sure, I didn't get to play ball or be president, but I got elected homecoming king and prom king anyway. I got into Nebraska like I wanted and early-rushed Phi Delts. At the end of the year me and my buddies threw a hitching Mexican party down at the cement plant. Shit, that was a good party. That was a good party!The only really bad thing about senior year was Lisa. Right before Christmas she dumped me. One minute she's totally in love with me and then boom she's going out with my football buddy Randy.Sometimes I wonder what would've happened if I'd actually won the election. Maybe my whole life would be different. Like I might never have gone to Yosemite with Greg and Travis.Or maybe I'd be dead.Sure, Tracy.Oh, yeah, sure. Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*Thanks, Tracy.Hey, Tracy I..Have a great summer.
