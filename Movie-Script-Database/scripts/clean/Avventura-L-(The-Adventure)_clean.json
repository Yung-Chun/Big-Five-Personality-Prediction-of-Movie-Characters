You'll have to excuse me.I'll wait for you here.But where are you going?If I had a man waiting for me for half an hour and whom I hadn't seen for a month ...What! After giving us such a run around...I see... so it's farewell to the yacht...and farewell to the cruise...That seems to apply to you also...How should I be ... arrogant?It was lovelier before.It's all my fault!There's nothing much to laugh at.Did you sleep well?I didn't know one could sleep so well on a yacht. It lulls you ...Oh, no... please... not here. It looks too dangerous.What is that one over there called?Sounds like the name of a fish -- merluzzo, basiluzzo...Stop ... stop the boat!But how did you become aware of it? Did it touch you?This one is gorgeous.There's the difference between you and me: you know how to put over certain things, and I don't. Sometimes I envy you.Better dead.I'm certainly not going to swim across.I would say he's pretty depraved.One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?Oh, how sweet... What a dear little darling!To the shark.At what?That sounds like a good idea. But why don't we all go together?Well, what?All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?How wonderful!I think you're very sweet, Corrado.There's no comparison.And where's Anna? Isn't she on the yacht?Patrizia! ...Is Anna there?It's a lamb!Find anything?Somebody must live here!What do you mean! What about Anna?As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.I... I don't know... I didn't think it was worthwhile... She was laughing over it...Maybe you'd better ask him.And how do you explain that?But why don't you tell him? A girl who was with us has disappeared.No, she didn't drown... She just disappeared, and nobody knows where.Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.Anna! . . . Anna!I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.Yes, very much so.Occasionally, but always with affection.I know. I keep asking myself what I could have done to prevent all this from happening.I think that you might go and have a look yourself.Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.Do you want me to open it?It's because of this... The dress... It's because of this dress. Anna gave it to me yesterday, right after the swim.I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.Yes.Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.Yes, you should go.I know it's difficult. But if you go on like this it will become even more difficult.Please, don't look so solemn... And don't wait for the train to come in.Please, please leave. I don't want to look out of the window and wave to you with a handkerchief.Go ahead, now say something! I want to know just what it is we have to say to each other.Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.Oh, Sandro...For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.Me... I... I... Please leave me alone.No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...From Rome.An intelligent clergyman, Princess? But I think the intelligent clergymen of today have so many other things to do.It was futile. We went all over.But why does she do these things? I can't stand it any more.It's divine!Do you consider that a compliment?But for what reason should I come there?They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.Not really.Giulia!It couldn't be any clearer.I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.I'm not coming.Any news?How long have you been married?My God ... Let's hope it was her.After that, you didn't see her anymore?Oh, no... What are you saying? I'm not insinuating anything...Look at that bridge! Who knows why they even bothered to make it...Look at that: a factory... a station... and look at those tracks, all full of weeds... But why?It's late... We should be going.Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.Don't think that I want to save myself from any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone. Please, Sandro, do try to understand me... It would look like I was trying to influence you, to force you, to control you... and that makes me feel uncomfortable...Some cigarettes, please... Do you have any?... Nazionali with filters ...Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: \"Claudia, I love you,\" I would believe you...No... Because then I'd force you to swear it, I'd force you to tell me an infinite amount of things... and that wouldn't be right, it couldn't be right... It would be absurd.But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...And why did you drop them?I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.What! Get married?What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.But why am I so infatuated with you?Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away...And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...Very well. But you must first tell me that when you go out without me it's like going out without one of your legs. Go ahead, have a look around the town all by yourself, but you'll have to hobble along on only one leg. And you must also tell me that you are filled with a great desire to embrace my shadow on the walls... Then you must tell me... You must tell me that you love me.So, you wonder why?Okay. In a few minutes.I was just coming out to meet you. How come you're back so soon?Sandro ...What's the matter?No, Sandro... Please...No reason why...What's the matter with you?Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...What are you saying?Oh, Sandro... I want everything you do. But...Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.Come, let's go. Pack your things, and I'll get mine ready too.How are you?Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.It means being without money.Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.Sandro, I'm not coming down.I'm too sleepy.Late, very late.I look at things differently... But maybe it's best we talk about it some other time. Do you mind turning off that light over there?Good night. Tell me that you love me.Tell me once more.I deserve it.Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?Would you please see if Sandro is with him? He's not in his room. I'm sorry to disturb you.Patrizia, I'm afraid.I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.Yes, you're right.

Hasn't Anna ever told you?Like this?And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.Shall we go for a swim?Anna!Let's see you dive from the top of those rocks, Giulia. That would be really sensational. Come on, Giulia ... your life is much too circumscribed.I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...What a question... Because I want to be with you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... Isn't this water wonderful!What could be more restful than this?... Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?Ask her.There too...What kind of a fish is that?My God, it's enormous.Anna...Here, drink some cognac.How are you?Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.And why haven't they left each other?Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.There will be plenty of time to talk about it later. We'll get married soon. That way we'll have more time...But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?But you just said that a month was too...And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?This is the kind of behavior that drives me crazy!Did you find her?No.Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?Tell Lady Patrizia that we can't leave now. In fact, we'll have to make a tour around the island...That doesn't make any difference! If we have to stay, we'll stay!Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.Patrizia!No. Now that we're here, let's have a look around Basiluzzo. When we were swimming, she swam out in that direction.Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.I'll go even further and say that her presence here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance.And why do you tell us this only now?Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.Are you the owner of this place?But where did you come from?Nothing... nothing at all!And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you tell him that too. That's what you believe, isn't it?Are you feeling better?You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?Has she ever spoken to you about me?And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.Whose boat is that?Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?And how come you're up so early?Unfortunately, no.Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?Yes, maybe that is better.Yes... I'm going... I'm going now.It's already two hours... What are we going to do?And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.Claudia, listen ... Claudia.That's true...But in the meantime, as far as I'm concerned, it's absolutely necessary to go to Milazzo. I know that you have no desire to meet me, and I shall take pains not to impose myself upon you. But, besides you, I am the closest person to your daughter...Pardon me for being so frank, but there are certain things that a father -- especially a father like you --cannot understand. So don't be stubborn. I'm coming with you.Patrizia, what are you going to do?I'll go and get my valise.Good. Then I'll meet you there.But what are you saying?... What are you saying?Tell me, Lieutenant, do you happen to know this F.Z. who wrote this article here?Where can we locate him? Don't you think that by offering a reward to anyone who can give us some information...Pardon me, Sergeant, but when did you get back?And the young lady who was with you?Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?Then I'll go with you.Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...But then when will we see each other?I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?It takes even less.I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.And what about you?Claudia, listen to me...But why, Claudia?... Why?Even if you chase me away, I... Claudia, let's not wait any longer... After, it will be too late ... Come with me.Which one of you is Zuria?Zuria?I would like to ask you something.You're kidding!I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc\u0082.Now listen, if I had any information, I wouldn't have come here to ask you. But I see that you, too, lack any information ...Is that possible?Is that far from here?Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...You really must do me this one favor.Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.But it even says what she bought: a bar of soap! So there's no point in making believe you can't remember.You have to be precise. Did this girl enter your store or didn't she?Was she blonde or brunette?How was she dressed?Pardon me, but has anyone else been here asking about this girl?Thanks.Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication...Well... Thanks for the information.It's better if we present a happy picture, no?Tell the Signora Patrizia that we are continuing the search...and that the Signorina Claudia will manage to survive somehow...No. I only want some information.We're searching for a girl of about twenty-five... Seems she boarded this bus two days ago, in the afternoon... You should remember her because she was a stranger around here...Can you tell me where she got off?Okay, thanks.And do you remember where she got off?Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?Thank you.Who knows why they all left...Are you joking?What is it, Claudia?Does it please you to say such things?Then why do you say them?Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.So, even if I did say them, I was sincere with her, as I am now with you.I have never seen a woman like you, who needs to see everything so clearly.At one time, all these houses were convents.Look! What a fantastic scene! What movement, what disorder! They were very much concerned with scenographic effects... an extraordinary sense of liberty...Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate for the construction of a school. It took me only a day and a half to finish it, and I got paid six million lire. Ever since then I've been doing estimates for other people's designs.Why are you looking at me like that?I don't know about that. And then, who's interested in beautiful things nowadays?Claudia, let's get married?Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?You look at me as though I had said something foolish...That's why I asked you...Are you ready?Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...Okay. I understand. See you later.As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square.But you know it already. Why must I tell you?Then I'll see you later.It's closed. Isn't there any custodian or caretaker inside?But it says it's open from 9:30 to 10:30., and it's ten o'clock now... That's a fine way to greet tourists.Are you the custodian?Nothing.Why?And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.But what?Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he is?Yes, we will.They didn't seem too good.Ettore must be fed up with me by now.Your mother?You see? Just like a robot.Come in.Aren't you going to change?Sure, that's what I said...Wow, it's ice cold...Why?Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow?Did you know that when I was a boy I wanted to be a diplomat? Can you imagine that! Me, a diplomat? It's strange but I never thought I'd be rich. I saw myself living in a rooming house, full of geniuses...Instead, I have two apartments, one in Rome and one in Milan. As far as genius goes, it's a habit I've never formed. What do you think of that?Good night, my love.I love you.I don't love you.That's not true. I love you.I want to take a look around first...

They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.What do you want, Raimondo? Do you want me? A few years ago, maybe... but now... And, then, at this hour of the day!Come, Claudia, do come in... There's no romance going on here.There, have you seen enough now? Are you satisfied?Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child.You know, I don't love anybody.He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?Have you ever been in love?Take it easy, Raimondo. Why are you getting so impatient?Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...But you have to consider all possibilities, Sandro.How long will it take to go there and come back?We had to notify her father.He'll be here sometime today. I also phoned my house in Milan... but Ettore had already left.No, who wants crackers... Why don't you go and have some coffee made instead?Let's hope they don't find her... If they do, they would find her dead.I don't see why I should mind.What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.Come on, Corrado, tell us what century it belongs to.But aren't you supposed to be on your way?But is it really necessary? Those two beasts... How absurd!What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.To do what?But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet! Raimondo!Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.But where did you finally end up?This is Claudia, Anna's friend... You've never met my husband, have you?But didn't he say he was coming here...First let the poor thing have something to eat.Are you ready? I'm not. That's all we needed -- a cocktail party... The vitality some people have irritates me! How does it look?You say that just to flatter me.No.Claudia... Let's go.But then why did you bother changing?Well, I'm looking for somebody else and who do I find but you.Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.You look so wonderfully tanned.And here's Sandro. Why don't you two go upstairs and change?Did you manage to find good rooms?You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.Oh, no, not at all. And then you know very well that he'll forgive you anything; just as long as you admit to him that you're a worse driver than he is...You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...What do you mean by sensible?See you soon, then.I imagine he must be inside sleeping.Ettore...Nothing, nothing at all. I was just looking for Sandro.Yes, yes, of course.More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea.
