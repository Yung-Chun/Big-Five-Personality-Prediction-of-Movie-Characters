Be a pal and take those over to Hinkleman, will ya?That's it.The kiss of death. As soon as they use the \"N\" word it's all over.You are a rug. I am talking astro-turf here. You're letting these women sharpen their cleats on you.You spend too much time being \"nice\" to a girl, you'll wind up sittin' around listening to her complain about the son of a bitch she really loves.Wake up, Stanley! These are the nineties. We're dealing with an entire generation of dysfunctional love junkies. You can't romance 'em. You gotta confuse 'em. It's the only thing that gets their attention. Let me demonstrate. You see that girl over there?Hi Lisa.Charlie.Lisa, this may seem a little odd, but my friend over there and I were having this discusion and I thought maybe you could settle it for us.Actually, I don't know... this is kind of a personal question.Alright. Just for the sake of argument, if I wasn't a happily married man... am I the kind of guy you'd go out with?Lisa, I have terrific news for you.I'm not married! Is this perfect or what? Listen, there's not a lot of women willing to come right out like that and admit they're attracted to a guy, but...Jeez... make up your mind.Okay. Bad example. Some of these women got so much baggage they need an emotional sky cap. I'll tell you what Stanley, tonight I'm gonna take you on a love safari, deep into the darkest heart of the urban jungle.The Monkey's Paw. Hottest new club in town. It's a guaranteed skirt alert and no dead beats allowed.Woah, do I detect a little self-image problem there, buddy? You just leave everything to me. This, my friend is going to be the perfect night on the town.Hold the phone. Killer at three o'clock.Oh my god... A perfect dime. The dame of dames. The Moby of my dick.You've come to the right place, ma'am. Just step right this way and pull up a chair...Here, let me take that for you.No! No! He only wants you to stop the cab!It's alright, Stanley.Why are you getting out here?Fine. Now don't forget. Ten o'clock at the Monkey's Paw. I've already got us lined up with a couple of authentic dimes.Well, I can't promise we'll get that lucky again... Later!Hey, Stanley. Nice wheels. What is that, a Rolls Canardley?You know, a Rolls Canardley. Rolls down one hill canardley roll up the next.Whatever you say, man.What do you think? Pretty terrific, huh? This place make Sodom and Gomorrah look like Mayberry.Right. The wet dream from the bank. Hold on... I think I see my future ex-wife.We're in luck. It's Barbie and Pebbles.No, problemo. Ladies, this is my pal Stanley Ipkiss. Stanley's very influential in the banking business.Hey Bobby! Bobby, buddy. What's happening man?This will just take a second. Yo Nick! It's me... Charlie!How much cash you got on you?You heard me. How much you got?Hand it over.Hey, I'll pay you back! I'm only carrying plastic. C'mon man, you want to stand out here all night?Hey Bobby!What happened to you last night? The girls and I were looking all over for you.As a matter of fact, you don't look so good. You got to take better care of yourself, man.Are you kidding? It was hotter than a pistol. Did you see the paper?Your girlfriend got a great review.Ah... She's a prospective client of Stanley's, sir.Look at that little creep. If it wasn't for his daddy he'd be out somewhere shakin' down school kids for lunch money.Who knows? Forget about her, Stanley. A dame like that is always looking for the B.B.D. The bigger better deal. Ask her what her sign is and she'll say dollar.Yeah. She can sense a guy's credit line at two hundred yards. Stanley, you need a girl you can depend on. Someone a little more down to earth... someone like...Like her! Someone like her. As a matter of fact I could use someone like her myself. Hel-lo there. May I be of some assistance?Forget her, Stanley. Ask her what her sign is and she'll say dollar.Woah! What side of who's bed did you wake up on?Yeah, well you look like you could use a little R and R there buddy... and as a matter of fact I've got just the ticket. Or should I say tickets?Saturday night. Grand opening of the Valhalla Casino. Serious skirt alert. Everybody who's anybody will be there. What do you say?Hello tall, Nordic and beautiful. One look at you and I know how your hat feels.Stanley! What are you doing here?So I deck this thug, grab his gun and tell Stanley, \"Take cover, Buddy. I'll get these folks out sae and sound.\" Y'know we should go back to my place so I can tell you the rest of the story.So what do you say, sweetheart?

What can I do for you?I've got to get ready for work.Here... mostly. Is something wrong?Mask -- who?Milo. No! Okay, so I went out on the town last night. A guy's got to have a little fun.Naw, I just took 'em with me in case I didn't make it home. I don't know about you, Lieutenant. But I've got a pretty good track record with the ladies.What?What are we gonna do, Milo? What are we gonna do?Back off Monkey-Boy, before I tell your daddy how you're running this branch like it's your own personal piggy bank! If the I.R.S. saw some of those files we could arrange a little vacation for you at Club Fed!I'm not sure. I haven't exactly been myself lately.I'm afraid to ask.Excuse me a second.Tina... What are you doing here?Oh, don't worry about me. I'm fine.I'm just having a little trouble sleeping is all. I guess you won't want to open that account after all this...What about the nightclub? I thought you were doing great.Well, there must be plenty of other places you could sing. Maybe even get a record deal...Not just like you. You've got a voice like... like an angel.No, I mean it. You really do.What is it with you, Tina? Why don't you believe in yourself?So maybe you've been singing for the wrong guys.Yeah.I'm not sure. Why are you interested?Sure.Really? They say he's pretty weird looking.You really think so?Actually... I sort of know the guy.The Mask. We're - old college buddies him and I.Oh yeah. To tell you the truth, I'm sorta covering for him on this bank thing. He's not such a bad guy, really. He just gets a little carried away.I suppose so.When? I mean, I'd need to tell him exactly.I'll be... I mean, I'll make sure he's there.Look, you're the big expert on masks, right? Well, I've got an emergency here!I found it... or it found me. I'm not sure. The problem is it's ruining my life!Yes! It's turning me into some kind of lunatic!It's not a delusion! Alright, I'll prove it to you if I have to, but I won't be responsible for the consequences.Last chance to hide all dangerous objects.Whooooooooaaaaa...It didn't work?It worked last night. And the night before. Maybe it only works at night... What kind of mask did you say this was.What if he banished him... into a mask?But what should I do about my date?You know. Tonight. The park. Tina. Do I go as myself of the Mask?Oh, Tina... Hi. You're early.I just... wanted to make sure you two got together okay.It's always beautiful at sunset. Those methane emissions really pick up the colors.Well... I'm sure my cousin will be along any minute. He never shows up anywhere 'till after sundown. He's sort of strange that way. I guess I'll get going.Dorian... You mean Dorian Tyrel?Tina, you've got to be careful of that guy. He's a dangerous criminal.Absolutely. You ought to hear the stories...C'mon, Tina this is serious. How involved are you with this guy?Oh, really? People close to Tyrel have a nasty habit of turning up dead, or haven't you noticed?And who are you with him Tina? I'm not exactly sure who I am anymore but at least I'm trying to find out. If you really had any faith in yourself, you wouldn't be hanging on to some kind of free ride.I'm sorry Tina. I guess I better get going.Thanks. Where are we going?It's crazy... I've lost all control. When I put on this mask I can do anything... be anything, but it's ruining my life.Gosh, Peggy. Do you really mean that?What?Peggy, what are you doing?My aparment. It's in my apartment!I don't know... You just put it on!I can explain everything...You've got to listen to me!Go find yourself a new home, Milo. It looks like I'm going to be here for a long long time...About time you found me a lawyer... ...Tina?What's wrong? Your boyfriend kick you out for not delivering me on schedule?I don't know. But I've got plenty of time to figure it out.Now is not the best time for me on trusting women.You ran out on him?He wasn't exactly Mother Theresa in the first place.A real change of pace for him.As long as he's got the mask, there's nothing they can do to stop him anyway. There's nothing anyone can do.It's like it brings you innermost desires to life. If deep down inside you're a little repressed and... a hopeless romantic, you become sort of a love-crazy wild man.Then the world's going to be a very dark place. And if I were you, I'd get out of town. Fast.For what?You're welcome.The Mask.Hey! A girl's being kidnapped out there! Do something!peers down the hall and seesMilo!Come on, boy!Come on, Milo!Keys, Milo. Get the keys!Good boy...I said \"keys\" not \"cheese\"! Keys. K-E-Y-S... keys!Atta boy, Milo. Now let's see if we can get out of here.Come on.Hold it! I warn you! I'm seriously stressed out here!You're right.Putting myself in your custody.Milo!Okay. Now we have to hurry or we'll miss the party.Now move.Okay. When I push the red button the safety is off, right?Alright, suit yourself. You stay and be a good boy.Pssst. You guys. Over here.Start sneaking people out the back. Watch out for the oil.Hang on, Tina.Milo! Milo, come!Hold it right there or you'll be looking for this on the bottom of the harbor.You can have it.

For sharing a sunset with me. For being the first guy to treat me like I was a person instead of a slab of meat. And for being any kind of romantic.

May it crack like an egg on Easter Sunday.Good afternoon, Councilman Snell. Nice of you to drop by.I got a little job for you, Tom. I want you to pull the Swede's gambling license.Pull a few strings. Find something in the fine print. I don't care how you do it, but do it. You owe me.That's pretty. What is that, a carnation?Nice. Hey, Eddy... call my florist. Two dozen pink carnations to Mrs. Snell with my regrets over her husband's untimely accident.That's smart. You're a very smart man. Now pull yourself together. Look at you.Shut the Swede down, Snell. We'll buy him out cheap with a little collateral the bank is about to provide us. And Gentlemen... we are going to be in the casino business.Nice work, Freeze. You boy are on your own now. I've got to make sure I'm seen downstairs.What the hell are you doing here?What the hell happened to you?Where's the money?Who?Where's Chun Woo?Yeah... sure.Son of a bitch! Who did this Eddy? Who?Come on!Clear the club. Now!This means you won't make it out of this club alive if you don't tell me where my money is.Now cut that out! Ventilate this goon!Hello, Kellaway. You got a warrant or did you just drop by for a night cap?Easy, junior. You're givin' me a woodey.For once you're on the right track, but that's not one of my men. Maybe you ought to try a little actual police work instead of this harassment bullshit.Ever wonder why you didn't make Captain, asshole? I got friends so high up they'd give you a nose bleed.You're a dead man.I'll be back on the streets before sunrise and you know it.A fifty thousand dollar reward to the man who finds this \"Mask\" character before the cops do. Get the word out to every street hustler and low life in this town. I want him here. In my office. Alive. By tomorrow! Now get going!What are you looking at?I'm losing nothing. Except maybe some extra baggage I don't need around here.You weren't putting up much of a fight when that green goon kissed you last night.Maybe you did and maybe you didn't, but I know this, one day real soon I'm gonna run this town and when I do there's gonna be payback for anyone who crossed me. I mean anyone.My pleasure, Swede. It's been too long. I was worried you were still pissed about that little thing with Harry the Hat.Congratulations on the new casino.Is that right?Thanks.Maybe I can help you out. I'm expecting to come into a little investment capital shortly. If worse comes to worse and you really need to bail out...Is that right?Sure, Swede. Take it easy.This is him?Okay Ipkiss. Where's the money from the heist?Thanks. Now I believe you have a pressing engagement.You're right. Easy boys. One thing at a time. Tell me about this mask, Ipkiss.

There's hundreds of women out there who are looking for a man just like you.Of course. DO you know how hard it is to find a decent man in this town? Most of them think monogamy is some kind of wood.They cut my salary. I just can't make it by on \"Dear Peggy\" anymore. The truth is, I want to be a real reporter and if I can break this story I know they'll let me. Look Stanley, I know Ripley Auto is a crooked operation. They may even have had ties to the Mob.

You know how hard it is to find an apartment in this city.Hey, you said you wouldn't hurt him!Ah... excuse me. If you don't mind, I'll just take my money and be going.
