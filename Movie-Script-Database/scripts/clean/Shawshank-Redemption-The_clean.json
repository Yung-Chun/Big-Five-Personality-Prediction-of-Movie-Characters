{"Shawshank-Redemption-The": {"ANDY": {"raw_line": "It was very bitter. She said she was glad I knew, that she hated all the sneaking around. She said she wanted a divorce in Reno.I told her I would not grant one.If they say so. I really don't remember. I was upset.She packed a bag and went to stay with Mr. Quentin.I went to a few bars first. Later, I decided to drive to Mr. Quentin's home and confront them. They weren't there...so I parked my car in the turnout...and waited.I'm not sure. I was confused. Drunk. I think mostly I wanted to scare them.Yes. I did.No. I was sobering up. I realized she wasn't worth it. I decided to let her have her quickie divorce.I did not. I got back in the car and drove home to sleep it off. Along the way, I stopped and threw my gun into the Royal River. I feel I've been very clear on this point.Yes. It does.Yes. It does.Strike me as a fantastic coincidence.It's the truth.Since I am innocent of this crime, sir, I find it decidedly inconvenient the gun was never found.Hadn't planned on it.What was his name?I was wondering if anyone knew his name.Hello. I'm Andy Dufresne.How do you know that?I didn't, since you ask.What else have you heard?What do you think?I understand you're a man who knows how to get things.I wonder if you could get me a rock-hammer?You make your customers' motives a part of your business?Fair enough. A rock-hammer is about eight or nine inches long. Looks like a miniature pickaxe, with a small sharp pick on one end, and a blunt hammerhead on the other. It's for rocks.Quartz, sure. And look. Mica. Shale. Silted granite. There's some graded limestone, from when they cut this place out of the hill.I'm a rockhound. At least I was, in my old life. I'd like to be again, on a limited scale.I have no enemies here.Tell me something. Would it help if I explained to them I'm not homosexual?Thanks for the advice.If there's trouble, I doubt a rock- hammer will do me any good.Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.Ten it is.Oh?I understand. Thank you, Mr...?Red. I'm Andy. Pleasure doing business with you.You get this in your eyes, it blinds you.Mr. Hadley. Do you trust your wife?What I mean is, do you think she'd go behind your back? Try to hamstring you?Because if you do trust her, there's no reason in the world you can't keep every cent of that money.If you want to keep that money, all of it, just give it to your wife. See, the IRS allows you a one-time- only gift to your spouse. It's good up to sixty thousand dollars.Tax free. IRS can't touch one cent.It's perfectly legal. Go ask the IRS, they'll say the same thing. Actually, I feel silly telling you all this. I'm sure you would have investigated the matter yourself.Of course not. But you will need somebody to set up the tax-free gift, and that'll cost you. A lawyer, for example......or come to think of it, I suppose I could set it up for you. That would save you some money. I'll write down the forms you need, you can pick them up, and I'll prepare them for your signature... nearly free of charge. I'd only ask three beers apiece for my co-workers, if that seems fair.I think a nan working outdoors feels more like a man if he can have a bottle of suds. That's only my opinion.No thanks. I gave up drinking.Chess. Now there's a game of kings. Civilized...strategic...Maybe you'll let me teach you someday. I've been thinking of getting a board together.We might do business on a board. But the pieces, I'd like to carve those myself. One side done in quartz... the opposing side in limestone.Years I've got. What I don't have are the rocks. Pickings here in the exercise yard are pretty slim.Not yet. I suppose I should.I suppose we are.I'm innocent, remember? Just like everybody else here.What are you in for, Red?Innocent?I know. I've seen it three times this month already.Can we talk business?Rita Hayworth. Can you get her?Weeks?I know. I've seen it three times this month already.Can we talk business?Rita Hayworth. Can you get her?Weeks?They'd never hear me over that. Let's get this over with.Okay.Anything you put in my mouth, you're going to lose.Okay. But you should know that sudden serious brain injury causes the victim to bite down. Hard. In fact, I understand the bite-reflex is so strong the victim's jaws have to be pried open with a crowbar.Good evening.Watch ye therefore, for ye know not when the master of the house cometh.John. Chapter 8, verse 12.It's called a rock blanket. It's for shaping and polishing rocks. Little hobby of mine.It's very pretty, sir.No, sir. Not especially.Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?I've been reassigned to you.Brooks? How long have you been librarian?In all that time, have you ever had an assistant?So why now? Why me?I see. Well. Why don't we have a seat and talk it over?What did you have in mind? A weekly draw on your pay?He was right. You don't want your money in a bank.What's that gonna earn you? Two and a half, three percent a year? We can do a lot better than that. So tell me, Mr. Dekins. Where do you want to send your kids? Harvard? Yale?I wouldn't say \"friends.\" I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning. That's a wonderful pet to have.Maybe it can do more than that. How about expanding the library? Get some new books in there.Ask the warden for funds.I see. Perhaps I could write to the State Senate and request funds directly from them.Still, I'd like to try, with your permission. I'll send a letter a week. They can't ignore me forever.Moresby Prison issued you that gun, but you actually had to pay for it?See, that's all deductible. You get to write that off.Say Red, could you hand me a stack of those 1040s?Brooks, you're not going to hurt Heywood, we all know that. Even Heywood knows it, right Heywood?Why? Ask anyone, they'll tell you. Brooks Hatlen is a reasonable man.You're not fooling anybody, so just put the damn knife down and stop scaring the shit out of people.Take it easy. You'll be all right.I just don't understand what happened in there, that's all.P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat. No hard feelings.Red!That's real pretty, Red. Nice work.What is all this?Dear Mr. Dufresne. In response to your repeated inquiries, the State Senate has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project... \" This is two hundred dollars.In addition, the Library District has generously responded with a charitable donation of used books and sundries. We trust this will fill your needs. We now consider the matter closed. Please stop sending us letters. Yours truly, the State Comptroller's Office.Only took six years. From now on, I send two letters a week instead of one.They broke the door down before I could take requests.Easiest time I ever did.I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company. Hardly felt the time at all.The music was here...and here. That's the one thing they can't confiscate, not ever. That's the beauty of it. Haven't you ever felt that way about music, Red?Here's where it makes most sense. We need it so we don't forget.That there are things in this world not carved out of gray stone. That there's a small place inside of us they can never lock away, and that place is called hope.Like Brooks did?You wonder where it went. I wonder where ten years went.Anniversary gift. Open it.Had to go through one of your competitors. Hope you don't mind. Wanted it to be a surprise.You gonna play something?...Stevenson. Next?Trade skills and hobbies, those go under educational. Stack right behind you.Dumas. You boys'll like that one. It's about a prison break.Two deposits, Casco Bank and New England First. Night drop, like always.Very nice.What you hear isn't half of it. He's got scams you haven't dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks. There's a river of dirty money flowing through this place.That's where I come in. I channel it, funnel it, filter it...stocks, securities, tax free municipals... I send that money out into the big world. And when it comes back...Cleaner. By the time Norton retires, I will have made him a millionaire.I thought you had more faith in me than that.Sure it will. But not to me, and certainly not to the warden.Peter Stevens.The silent, silent partner. He's the guilty one, your Honor. The man with the bank accounts. That's where the filtering process starts. They trace it back, all they're gonna find is him.A phantom. An apparition. Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit. I conjured him out of thin air. He doesn't exist...except on paper.Sure you can, if you know how the system works, and where the cracks are. It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail. Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate, social security card, driver's license. They ever track those accounts, they'll wind up chasing a figment of my imagination.It's funny. On the outside, I was an honest man. Straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook.I don't run the scams, Red, I just process the profits. That's a fine line, maybe. But I've also built that library, and used it to help a dozen guys get their high school diplomas. Why do you think the warden lets me do all that?I work cheap. That's the trade-off.Perhaps it's time you considered a new profession. What I mean is, you don't seem to be a very good thief. Maybe you should try something else.Everyone's innocent in here. Don't you know that?I don't waste time on losers, Tommy.That's a good start. If we do this, we do it all the way. One hundred percent. Nothing half-assed.Well. You've come to the right place then....and the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor...and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor, shall be lifted nevermore! \"That's right.Well?May not be as bad as you think.We'll see how the score comes out.Sir?I think he's telling the truth.It wouldn't matter. With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.They'd have his last known address. Names of relatives... Well it's a chance. isn't it? How can you be so obtuse?Obtuse! Is it deliberate? The country club will have his old time cards! W-2s with his name on them!Look, if it's the squeeze, don't worry. I'd never say what goes on in here. I'd be just as indictable as you for laundering the money!I was just trying to rest your mind at ease, that's all.What's the matter with you? It's my chance to get out, don't you see that? It's my life! Don't you understand it's my life?I'm done. It stops right now. Get H&R Block to declare your income.My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know. Like a closed book. Complained about it all the time. She was beautiful. I loved her. But I guess I couldn't show it enough. I killed her, Red.I didn't pull the trigger. But I drove her away. That's why she died. Because of me, the way I am.No. I didn't. Someone else did, and I wound up here. Bad luck, I guess.It floats around. Has to land on somebody. Say a storm comes through. Some folks sit in their living rooms and enjoy the rain. The house next door gets torn out of the ground and smashed flat. It was my turn, that's all. I was in the path of the tornado. I just had no idea the storm would go on as long as it has. Think you'll ever get out of here?Tell you where I'd go. Zihuatanejo.Mexico. Little place right on the Pacific. You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific? They say it has no memory. That's where I'd like to finish out my life, Red. A warm place with no memory. Open a little hotel right on the beach. Buy some worthless old boat and fix it up like new. Take my guests out charter fishing. You know, a place like that, I'd need a man who can get things.You underestimate yourself.Not me. I didn't shoot my wife and I didn't shoot her lover, and whatever mistakes I made I've paid for and then some. That hotel and that boat...I don't think it's too much to want. To look at the stars just after sunset. Touch the sand. Wade in the water. Feel free.You're right. It's down there, and I'm in here. I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living or get busy dying.Red, if you ever get out of here, do me a favor. There's this big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is?One in particular. Got a long rock wall with a big oak at the north end. Like something out of a Robert Frost poem. It's where I asked myYou'll just have to pry up that rock and see.Just about done, sir.Three deposits tonight.Just about done, sir.My name is Peter Stevens. I've come to close out some accounts.Thank you. I'm sure I will.Please. Would you add this to your outgoing mail?Dear Red. If you're reading this, you've gotten out. And if you've come this far, maybe you're willing to come a little further. You remember the name of the town, don't you? I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels. I'll keep an eye out for you and the chessboard ready. Remember, Red. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. I will be hoping that this letter finds you, and finds you well. Your friend.

Absolutely. I've learned my lesson. I can honestly say I'm a changed man. I'm no longer a danger to society. That's the God's honest truth. No doubt about it.There's a con like me in every prison in America, I guess. I'm the guy who can get it for you. Cigarettes, a bag of reefer if you're partial, a bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's high school graduation. Damn near anything, within reason.Yes sir, I'm a regular Sears & Roebuck.So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949 and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him, I told him no problem. And it wasn't.Andy came to Shawshank Prison in early 1947 for murdering his wife and the fella she was bangin'.On the outside, he'd been vice- president of a large Portland bank. Good work for a man as young as he was, when you consider how conservative banks were back then.There they are, boys. The Human Charm Bracelet.Bear Catholic? Pope shit in the woods? Smokes or coin, bettor's choice.High roller. Who's your horse?That's five cigarettes on Fat-Ass. Any takers?I must admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him. He might'a been important on the outside, but in here he was just a little turd in prison grays. Looked like a stiff breeze could blow him over. That was my first impression of the man.Little fella on the end. Definitely. I stake half a pack. Any takers?C'mon, boys, who's gonna prove me wrong? Floyd, Skeet, Joe, Heywood. Four brave souls, ten smokes apiece. That's it, gentlemen, this window's closed.The first night's the toughest, no doubt about it. They march you in naked as the day you're born, fresh from a Bible reading, skin burning and half-blind from that delousing shit they throw on you......and when they put you in that cell, when those bars slam home, that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye...a long cold season in hell stretching out ahead...nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.Most new fish come close to madness the first night. Somebody always breaks down crying. Happens every time. The only question is, who's it gonna be?It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess. I had my money on Andy Dufresne...I remember my first night. Seems a long time ago now.The boys always go fishin' with first-timers...and they don't quit till they reel someone in.His first night in the joint, Andy Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes. He never made a sound...Give him some'a your cigarettes instead, cheap bastard.The wife-killin' banker.I keep my ear to the ground. Why'd you do it?Hell, you'll fit right in, then. Everyone's innocent in here, don't you know that? Heywood! What are you in for, boy?People say you're a cold fish. They say you think your shit smells sweeter than ordinary. That true?Ain't made up my mind yet.I'm known to locate certain things from time to time. They seem to fall into my hands. Maybe it's 'cause I'm Irish.What is it and why?If you wanted a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask questions. I'd just quote a price. A toothbrush, see, is a non-lethal sort of object.Rocks.Quartz?So?Yeah, that or maybe plant your toy in somebody's skull?No? Just wait.Word gets around. The Sisters have taken a real shine to you, yes they have. Especially Bogs.Neither are they. You have to be human first. They don't qualify. Bull queers take by force, that's all they want or understand. I'd grow eyes in the back of my head if I were you.That comes free. But you understand my concern.Then I guess you wanna escape. Tunnel under the wall maybe? I miss the joke. What's so funny?What's this item usually go for?My standard mark-up's twenty percent, but we're talkin' about a special object. Risk goes up, price goes up. Call it ten bucks even.I'll see what I can do. But it's a waste of money.Folks who run this place love surprise inspections. They turn a blind eye to some things, but not a gadget like that. They'll find it, and you'll lose it. Mention my name, we'll never do business again. Not for a pair of shoelaces or a stick of gum.Red. The name's Red.I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby. He had a quiet way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here. He strolled. like a man in a park without a care or worry. Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place. Yes, I think it would be fair to say I liked Andy from the start.He was a man who adapted fast.Years later, I found out he'd brought in quite a bit more than just ten dollars...When they check you into this hotel, one of the bellhops bends you over and looks up your works, just to make sure you're not carrying anything. But a truly determined man can get an object quite a ways up there.That's how Andy joined our happy little Shawshank family with more than five hundred dollars on his person. Determination.Andy was right. I finally got the joke. It would take a man about six hundred years to tunnel under the wall with one of these.I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the good fight, and the Sisters let him be. I wish I could tell you that, but prison is no fairy-tale world.He never said who did it...but we all knew.Things went on like that for a while. Prison life consists of routine, and then more routine.Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises.The Sisters kept at him. Sometimes he was able to fight them off... sometimes not.He always fought, that's what I remember. He fought because he knew if he didn't fight, it would make it that much easier not to fight the next time.Half the time it landed him in the infirmary......the other half, it landed him in solitary. Warden Norton's \"grain & drain\" vacation. Bread, water, and all the privacy you could want.And that's how it went for Andy. That was his routine. I do believe those first two years were the worst for him. And I also believe if things had gone on that way, this place would have got the best of him. But then, in the spring of 1949, the powers-that-be decided that...It was outdoor detail, and May is one damn fine month to be workin' outdoors.More than a hundred men volunteered for the job.Wouldn't you know it? Me and some fellas I know were among the names called.Only cost us a pack of smokes per man. I made my usual twenty percent, of course.Crying shame. Some folks got it awful bad.Hey, you nuts? Keep your eyes on your pail!Andy! Come back! Shit!God damn it...And that's how it came to pass, that on the second-to-last day of the job, the convict crew that tarred the plate factory roof in the spring of '49......wound up sitting in a row at ten o'clock in the morning, drinking icy cold Black Label beer courtesy of the hardest screw that ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.The colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous.We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders, and felt like free men. We could'a been tarring theAs for Andy, he spent that break hunkered in the shade, a strange little smile on his face, watching us drink his beer.You could argue he'd done it to curry favor with the guards. Or maybe make a few friends among us cons. Me, I think he did it just to feel normal again...if only for a short while.King me....and totally fuckin' inexplicable. Hate that game.You come to the right place. I'm the man who can get things.That'd take you years.How's that rock-hammer workin' out anyway? Scratch your name on your wall yet?Andy? I guess we're gettin' to be friends, ain't we?I ask a question? Why'd you do it?Murder. Same as you.The only guilty man in Shawshank.Here's the good part. Bugs come out of the walls to get his ass.Sure. What do you want?No problem. Take a few weeks.Don't have her stuffed down my pants this very moment, sorry to say. Relax. What are you so nervous about? She's just a woman.Sure. What do you want?No problem. Take a few weeks.Don't have her stuffed down my pants this very moment, sorry to say. Relax. What are you so nervous about? She's just a woman.Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth, and neither did his friends. What they did do is beat him within an inch of his life...Andy spent a month in traction.Bogs spent a week in the hole.Two things never happened again after that. The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again......and Bogs never walked again. They transferred him to a minimum security hospital upstate. To my knowledge, he lived out the rest of his days drinking his food through a straw.I'm thinkin' Andy could use a nice welcome back when he gets out of the infirmary.Man likes to play chess. Let's get him some rocks.Horse apple.No, horse shit. Petrified.Despite a few hitches, the boys came through in fine style......and by the week Andy was due back, we had enough rocks saved up to keep him busy till Rapture.Also got a big shipment in that week. Cigarettes, chewing gum, shoelaces, playing cards with naked ladies on 'em, you name it... ...and, of course, the most important item.Tossin' cells was just an excuse. Truth is, Norton wanted to size Andy up.Makin' yourself some friends, Andy.Got you out of the laundry, didn't it?So Andy started writing a letter a week, just like he said.And just like Norton said, Andy got no answers. But still he kept on.The following April, Andy did tax returns for half the guards at Shawshank.Year after that, he did them all... including the warden's.Year after that, they rescheduled the start of the intramural season to coincide with tax season...The guards on the opposing teams all remembered to bring their W-2's.Yes sir, Andy was a regular H&R Block. In fact, he got so busy at tax time, he was allowed a staff.Got me out of the wood shop a month out of the year, and that was fine by me.And still he kept sending those letters...What the hell's going on?No. We'll handle this. Ain't that right, Brooks? Just settle down and we'll talk about it, okay?Why? What's Heywood done to you?Yeah, that's right. That's what everybody says.You've had worse from shaving. What'd you do to set him off?Heywood, enough. Ain't nothing wrong with Brooksie. He's just institutionalized, that's all.Man's been here fifty years. This place is all he knows. In here, he's an important man, an educated man. A librarian. Out there, he's nothing but a used-up old con with arthritis in both hands. Couldn't even get a library card if he applied. You see what I'm saying?Believe what you want. These walls are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. After long enough, you get so you depend on 'em. That's \"institutionalized.\"Goddamn right. They send you here for life, and that's just what they take. Part that counts, anyway.He should'a died in here, goddamn it.Is that Jake?It never would have occurred to us, if not for Andy. It was his idea. We all agreed it was the right thing to do...Lord. Brooks was a sinner. Jake was just a crow. Neither was much to look at. Both got institutionalized. See what you can do for 'em. Amen.I have no idea to this day what them two Italian ladies were singin' about. Truth is, I don't want to know. Some things are best left unsaid. I like to think they were singin' about something so beautiful it can't be expressed in words, and makes your heart ache because of it.I tell you, those voices soared. Higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream. It was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made these walls dissolve away...and for the briefest of moments -- every last man at Shawshank felt free.It pissed the warden off something terrible.Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt.Oh, they let you tote that record player down there, huh? I could'a swore they confiscated that stuff.Played a mean harmonica as a younger man. Lost my taste for it. Didn't make much sense on the inside.Forget?Hope is a dangerous thing. Drive a man insane. It's got no place here. Better get used to the idea.Yes sir, without a doubt. I can say I'm a changed man. No danger to society, that's the God's honest truth. Absolutely rehabilitated.Same old, same old. Thirty years. Jesus. When you say it like that...It's very pretty, Andy. Thank you.Not today.Andy was as good as his word. He kept writing to the State Senate. Two letters a week instead of one.In 1959, the folks up Augusta way finally clued in to the fact they couldn't buy him off with just a 200 dollar check. Appropriations Committee voted an annual payment of 500 dollars, just to shut him up.Those checks came once a year like clockwork.You'd be amazed how far Andy could stretch it. He made deals with book clubs, charity groups...he bought remaindered books by the pound...I got here an auto repair manual, and a book on soap carving.Maybe that should go under educational too.By the year Kennedy was shot, Andy had transformed a broom closet smelling of turpentine into the best prison library in New England.That was also the year Warden Norton instituted his famous \"Inside-Out\" program. You may remember reading about it. It made all the papers and got his picture in LIFE magazine.Nobody asked you.None of the inmates were invited to express their views...'Course, Norton failed to mention to the press that \"bare minimum of expense\" is a fairly loose term. There are a hundred different ways to skim off the top. Men, materials, you name it. And, oh my Lord, how the money rolled in...And behind every shady deal, behind every dollar earned......there was Andy, keeping the books.Got his fingers in a lot of pies, from what I hear.Money like that can be a problem. Sooner or later you gotta explain where it came from.It's clean as a virgin's whistle?Jesus. They ever catch on, he's gonna wind up wearing a number himself.I'm sure you're good, but all that paper leaves a trail. Anybody gets too curious -- FBI, IRS, whatever -- that trail's gonna lead to somebody.Who then?Who?Yeah, okay, but who the hell is he?You can't just make a person up.Jesus. Did I say you were good? You're Rembrandt.Does it ever bother you?To keep you happy and doing the laundry. Money instead of sheets.Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in 1965 on a two year stretch for B&E. Cops caught him sneakin' TV sets out the back door of a JC Penney.Young punk, Mr. Rock n' Roll, cocky as hell...We liked him immediately.As it turns out, Tommy had himself a young wife and new baby girl...Maybe it was the thought of them onWhatever it was, something lit a fire under that boy's ass.So Andy took Tommy under his wing. Started walking him through his ABCs...Tommy took to it pretty well, too. Boy found brains he never knew he had.After a while, you couldn't pry those books out of hands.Ass in gear, son! You're putting us behind!Before long, Andy started him on his course requirements. He really liked the kid, that was part of it. Gave him a thrill to help a youngster crawl off the shitheap. But that wasn't the only reason...Prison time is slow time. Sometimes it feels like stop-time. So you do what you can to keep going...Some fellas collect stamps. Others build matchstick houses. Andy built a library. Now he needed a new project. Tommy was it. It was the same reason he spent years shaping and polishing those rocks. The same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall...In prison, a man'll do most anything to keep his mind occupied.By 1966...right about the time Tommy was getting ready to take his exams...it was lovely Racquel.That's crap, son. He's proud of you. Proud as a hen. We been friends a long time. I know him as good as anybody.Smart as they come. Used to be a banker on the outside.Murder.You wouldn't think, lookin' at him. Caught his wife in bed with some golf pro. Greased 'em both. C'mon, boy, back to work...Andy?Like hell. You didn't pull the trigger, and you didn't convict him.Since '47. Going on nineteen years.Board of Education.Looks that way. You gonna open it or stick your thumb up your butt?Well, shit.That don't make you a murderer. Bad husband, maybe.Feel bad about it if you want. But you didn't pull the trigger.Bad luck? Jesus.Sure. When I got a long white beard and about three marbles left rolling around upstairs.Zihuatanejo?Jesus, Andy. I couldn't hack it on the outside. Been in here too long. I'm an institutional man now. Like old Brooks Hatlen was.Bullshit. In here I'm the guy who can get it for you. Out there, all you need are Yellow Pages. I wouldn't know where to begin. Pacific Ocean? Hell. Like to scare me to death, somethin' that big.Goddamn it, Andy, stop! Don't do that to yourself! Talking shitty pipedreams! Mexico's down there, and you're in here, and that's the way it is!Andy?Lots of hayfields there.What? What's buried there?I tell you, the man was talkin' crazy. I'm worried, I truly am.Every man's got a breaking point.Yeah. Sure. That's right.I have had some long nights in stir. Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts, time can draw out like a blade...That was the longest night of my life...Well what?No sir, he didn't!They got this skinny kid named Rory Tremont to go in the hole. He wasn't much in the brains department, but he possessed the one most important qualification for the job... ...he was willing to go.Probably thought he'd win a Bronze Star or something.It was his third day on the job.And then came the unmistakable sound of Rory Tremont losing his last few meals. The whole cellblock heard it. I mean, it echoed.I laughed myself right into solitary. Two week stretch.It's shit, it's shit, oh my God it's shit...Andy once talked about doing easy time in the hole. Now I knew what he meant.In 1966, Andy Dufresne escaped from Shawshank Prison.All they found of him was a muddy set of prison clothes, a bar of soap, and an old rock-hammer damn near worn down to the nub.I remember thinking it would take a man six hundred years to tunnel through the wall with it. Andy did it in less than twenty.Andy loved geology. I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature. An ice age here, a million years of mountain-building there, plates of bedrock grinding against each other over a span of millennia...Geology is the study of pressure and time. That's all it takes, really. Pressure and time.That and a big damn poster.Like I said. In prison, a man'll do most anything to keep his mind occupied.It turns out Andy's favorite hobby was totin' his wall out into the exercise yard a handful at a time...While the rest of us slept, Andy spent years workin' the nightshift...Probably took him most of a year just to get his head through.I guess after Tommy was killed, Andy decided he'd been here just about long enough.Andy did like he was told. Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine.The guard simply didn't notice. Neither did I. I mean, seriously, how often do you really look at a man's shoes?Andy crawled to freedom through five hundred yards of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine. Or maybe I just don't want to.Five hundred yards. The length of five football fields. Just shy of half a mile.The next morning, right about the time Racquel was spilling her little secret......a man nobody ever laid eyes on before strolled into the Casco Bank of Portland. Until that moment, he didn't exist -- except on paper.He had all the proper I.D. Driver's license, birth certificate, social security card. The signature was a spot-on match.Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the Portland area that morning. All told, he blew town with better than 370 thousand dollars of Warden Norton's money. Severance pay for nineteen years.I wasn't there to see it, but I hear Byron Hadley was sobbing like a little girl when they took him away.Norton had no intention of goin' that quietly.I like to think the last thing that went through his head...other than that bullet...was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.Not long after the warden deprived us of his company, I got a postcard in the mail. It was blank. But the postmark said, \"McNary, Texas.\"McNary. Right on the border. That's where Andy crossed. When I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down, it makes me laugh all over again...Andy Dufresne, who crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side. Andy Dufresne, headed for the Pacific.Those of us who knew him best talk about him often. I swear, the stuff he pulled. It always makes us laugh.Sometimes it makes me sad, though, Andy being gone. I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged, that's all. Their feathers are just too bright......and when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice...but still, the place you live is that much more drab and empty that they're gone.I guess I just miss my friend.But there are times I curse him for the dreams he left behind......dreams where I am lost in a warm place with no memory.An ocean so big it strikes me dumb. Waves so quiet they strike me deaf. Sunshine so bright it strikes me blind. It is a place that is blue beyond reason. Bluer than can possibly exist. Bluer than my mind can possibly grasp.I am terrified. There is no way home.Andy. I know you're in that place. Look at the stars for me just after sunset. Touch the sand...wade in the water...and feel free.I heard you. Rehabilitated. Let's see now. You know, come to think of it, I have no idea what that means.I know what you think it means. Me, I think it's a made-up word, a poli- tician's word. A word so young fellas like you can wear a suit and tie and have a job. What do you really want to know? Am I sorry for what I did?Not a day goes by I don't feel regret, and not because I'm in here or because you think I should. I look back on myself the way I was...stupid kid who did that terrible crime...wish I could talk sense to him. Tell him how things are. But I can't. That kid's long gone, this old man is all that's left, and I have to live with that. Rehabilitated? That's a bullshit word, so you just go on ahead and stamp that form there, sonny, and stop wasting my damn time. Truth is, I don't give a shit.Sir? Restroom break sir?Thirty years I've been asking permission to piss. I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.Women, too, that's the other thing. I forgot they were half the human race. There's women everywhere, every shape and size. I find myself semi-hard most of the time, cursing myself for a dirty old man.Not a brassiere to be seen, nipples poking out at the world. Jeezus, pleeze-us. Back in my day, a woman out in public like that would have been arrested and given a sanity hearing.They're calling this the Summer of Love. Summer of Loonies, you ask me.Yes sir. That I am.Things got different out here.Guess the world moved on.There is a harsh truth to face. No way I'm gonna make it on the outside.All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole.Terrible thing, to live in fear. Brooks Hatlen knew it. Knew it all too well. All I want is to be back where things make sense. Where I won't have to be afraid all the time.Only one thing stops me. A promise I made to Andy.Get busy living or get busy dying. That is goddamn right.For the second time in my life, I am guilty of committing a crime.Parole violation. I doubt they'll toss up any roadblocks for that. Not for an old crook like me.McNary, Texas?I find I am so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it is the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain... THE BUSI hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.

guard. I am Mr. Norton, the warden. You are sinners and scum, that's why they sent you to me. Rule number one: no blaspheming. I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain in my prison. The other rules you'll figure out as you go along. Any questions?Any other questions? I believe in two things. Discipline and the Bible. Here, you'll receive both. Put your faith in the Lord. Your ass belongs to me. Welcome to Shawshank....the roof of the license-plate factory needs resurfacing. I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work. We're gonna be taking names in this steel bucket here...Solitary. A week. Make sure he takes his Bible.Add another week for blasphemy.Let's try the second tier.I'm pleased to see you reading this. Any favorite passages?Luke. Chapter 13, verse 35. I've always liked that one. But I prefer: \"I am the light of the world. He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\"I hear you're good with numbers. How nice. A man should have a skill.I can't say I approve of this... ...but I suppose exceptions can always be made.I almost forgot.I'd hate to deprive you of this. Salvation lies within.My wife made that in church group.You like working in the laundry?Perhaps we can find something more befitting a man of your education.Not a dime. My budget's stretched thin as it is.Far as them Republican boys in Augusta are concerned, there's only three ways to spend the taxpayer's hard-earned when it come to prisons. More walls. More bars. More guards.They sure can, but you write your letters if it makes you happy. I'll even mail 'em for you, how's that?...a genuine, progressive advance in corrections and rehabilitation. Our inmates, properly supervised, will be put to work outside these walls performing all manner of public service. Cutting pulpwood, repairing bridges and causeways, digging storm drains...These men can learn the value of an honest day's labor while providing a valuable service to the community -- and at a bare minimum of expense to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer!Ned, we're providing a valuable community service.Ned, I wouldn't worry too much over this contract. Seems to me I've already got my boys committed elsewhere. You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.Get my stuff down t'laundry. Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot. Tell 'em if they over- starch my shirts again, they're gonna hear about it from me. How do I look?Big charity to-do up Portland way. Governor's gonna be there. Want the rest of that? Woman can't bake worth shit.Well. I have to say, that's the most amazing story I ever heard. What amazes me most is you were taken in by it.It's obvious this fellow Williams is impressed with you. He hears your tale of woe and quite naturally wants to cheer you up. He's young, not terribly bright. Not surprising he didn't know what a state he'd put you in.Let's say for a moment Blatch does exist. You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, \"Yes, I did it! I confess! By all means, please add a life term to my sentence!\"That's assuming Blatch is even still there. Chances are excellent he'd be released by now. Excellent.What? What did you call me?Dufresne, if you want to indulge this fantasy, that's your business. Don't make it mine. This meeting's over.Don't you ever mention money to me again, you sorry son of a bitch! Not in this office, not anywhere! Get in here! Now!Solitary! A month!Tommy, we've got a situation here. I think you can appreciate that.I tell you, son, this really came along and knocked my wind out. It's got me up nights, that's the truth.The right decision. Sometimes it's hard to figure out what that is. You understand? Think hard, Tommy. If I'm gonna move on this, there can't be the least little shred of doubt. I have to know if you what you told Dufresne was the truth.Would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury...having placed your hand on the Good Book and taken an oath before Almighty God Himself?That's what I thought.Terrible thing. Man that young, less than a year to go, trying to escape. Broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him, truly it did.Nothing stops! NOTHING! Or you will do the hardest time there is. No more protection from the guards. I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton and put you inLickety-split. I wanna get home.Get my stuff down t'laundry. And shine my shoes. I want 'em lookin' like mirrors. Nice havin' you back, Andy. Place just wasn't the same without you.I want every man on that cellblock questioned! Start with that friend of his!Him.What do you mean \"he just wasn't here?\" Don't say that to me, Haig! Don't say that to me again!I can see that, Haig! You think I'm blind? Is that what you're saying? Am I blind, Haig?What about you? You blind? Tell me what this is!You see Dufresne's name? I sure do! Right there, see? \"Dufresne.\" He was in his cell at lights out! Stands to reason he'd still be here this morning! I want him found! Not tomorrow, not after breakfast! Now!Well?I see you two all the time, you're thick as thieves, you are! He must'a said something!Lord! It's a miracle! Man up and vanished like a fart in the wind! Nothin' left but some damn rocks on the windowsill and that cupcake on the wall! Let's ask her! Maybe she knows! What say there, Fuzzy- Britches? Feel like talking? Guess not. Why should you be different?It's a conspiracy! That's what this is! It's one big damn conspiracy! And everyone's in on it! Including her!I don't care what it smells like!Never mind, I said! Just keep going!Lickety-split.
