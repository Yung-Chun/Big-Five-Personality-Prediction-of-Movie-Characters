CABIN - NIGHT ASH severs his hand from his wrist with the chainsaw.In order to rid myself of the foul thing, I read from a passage in the book that was supposed to open a hole. A hole in Time that would send the Evil back. And it worked. A BANDAGED, ONE HANDED ASH recites the incantation from the Necronomicon. EXT. CABIN - NIGHT The Time vortex is created.

He is swept away from us, hand over foot, through the dark void of Time. ANIMATION - A TENDRIL OF SMOKE swirls through blackness as a chorus of women's voices build to eerie crescendo, from a musical note to a SCREAM. The smoke swirls, pulls in upon itself, like a thing alive, and forms the words:He SCREAMS but there is no sound. No scream. Only the steady BEATING of his heart.

ABOVE THE PIT - THE VILLAGERS gasp as...All right now. Who wants to be next? Who wants some.You want some more? Huh?! Gold Tooth and the others give him a wide berth.

TEMPLE RUINS - LONG SHOT - NIGHT A massive grouping of freestanding rectangular stones, each twenty feet tall. The remains of an ancient temple. In the center of the ruins there burns a roaring bonfire. As old Woman stirs a cauldron atop the flames. Nearby, Arthur converses with his four Lieutenants. EXT. WITHIN THE RUINS - NIGHT CLOSE UP - ASH opens his mouth to allow a spoonful of food to enter. No sooner has he swallowed then a piece of fruit is offered. He waves it away with a satisfied burp and turns to drink from a goblet on wine, brought to his lips by a female hand.First you wanta kill me, now ya wanna kiss me. He spits out a mouthful of grape seeds.Lady, just leave me alone.They're mistaken. She stares deeply into his eyes.Well what is it? Can you send me back or not?The Necronomicon. Yeah, that's the thing that got me here.Me? Now way, no day. Only place I'm goin' is home. A sudden gust of wind whips up the flames of the fire.His haw drops. He slowly stands as...It's a trick.

He carries a double-bladed battle axe.points to the hand piece on a hanging suit of battle armor.tightens the tension on the shock absorber springs with a ratchet like device.extends his arm triggering the tightly wound spring.stares over the castle wall to the foreboding wasteland with apprehension. The wind blows upon his hair. Sheila appears behind him. She drapes a grey garment over Ash. A magnificent cape. Ash draws her body close to his. He wraps the cape around her. Together they stare off into the night, then turn to one another and kiss. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. LANDSCAPE OF CRACKED GROUND 1500MM LENS - DAY Arthur's castle in the distance. In the foreground, five menHe wears an iron breastplate with the insignia of Arthur's army that compliments his new spring-powered iron hand.

I know your damn words. All right? Now you get this straight: I get the book, you send me back. That's the deal. After that I'm history.

He moves to the front door and peers out through a crack.snags the horse's reigns.Easy, boy. The horse calms. Ash ties it to a tree, patting it's head. A shadow passes behind him. He turns toward the Mill. ASH'S P.O.V. THROUGH THE MILL'S OPEN DOOR He sees am image of himself inside the Mill. Peering out. EXT. MILLstares in disbelief, then the wind slams the front door of the Mill, halting Ash's view. Ash races for the Mill. INT.

He moves to the fireplace and hunches before the flames, CAMERA PANS TO....is unaware of them as he kneels close to the fire. TINY ASH #1, #2, AND #3 grab a discarded dinner fork. Like men on a battering ram, they race forward to jam it into Ash's buttocks.SCREAMS in agony and jerks forward, banging his head into the stove pipe. TINY ASH #4, #5, AND #6 lift the barrel of the shotgun in Ash's direction. Another leaps upon the shotgun's trigger. BOOM!barely dives away from the blast the would have taken his head off.pulls the fork from his buttocks and heaves it. TINY ASH #1 is running for his life, as fast as his tiny legs will carry him.

His head slams into a stove pipe. He crumples. He lands with his cheek pressed against the hot stove. SSSSSSssss. He pries his face loose with a spatula.with an upside-down bucket on his head, slips and falls, back and forth on the grease. He stands and tries to dislodge the bucket. He trips over the broom handle, again thrust in his path. He falls backward, onto a crochet basket with knitting needles jutting from it.has seen him. He \"accidentally\" elbows the log and Tiny Ash #2 into the stove's fire.Ooops. TINY ASH #2 is burned alive.glances downward at the pitter patter sound of tiny feet. TINY ASH #3 is dashing across the open expanse of floor. Ash's gigantic foot comes down to crush the little man. Tiny Ash #3 raises a rusty nail into the path of the descending foot.jerks his leg upward in pain. Ash dances about the place hopping on one foot, HOWLING. He strays into the greasy area of the floor and stumbles over the broomstick again thrust in his path, swung there by Tiny ASHES #6, #7 and #8. He almost regains his balance when he strays into the oil patch, falls, and hits his head on the stone floor. BLACKNESS.awakens on the floor of the Mill, like Gulliver he is bound with tiny ropes. Directly above him, on the edge of a table... TINY ASHES #4 AND #5 suspend Tiny Ash #6 by his legs. TINY ASH #7 AND #8 stand atop Ash's face. They push from either side of his nostrils, plugging his nose. Ash's mouth opens as he gasps for air. As he inhales... SUSPENDED TINY ASH #6 is released. TINY ASH #6 - SLOW MOTION - WIND FAN He free falls for a moment, then the tiny body arcing to form a perfect swam dive, plunges down into Ash's opened throat.inhales the living beast whole. He chokes violently. He breaks his bonds an he hacks for breath. He puts his finger down his throat, trying to make himself vomit up the little man, to no avail. He looks about to crush some of the little ASHES but they are gone. He places his hand on his stomach and dizzily stumbles to a chair. He goes pale.Nasty little thing's inside me. He stands indignant but double over in sudden pain. Well let's see how you like a little hot water! He grabs the hot kettle from the stove and pours the scalding contents painfully down his throat. He sets down the kettle and waits for a moment. A tiny SCREAM emits from Ash's stomachemits a bark of LAUGHTER. He clutches as his chest. Then his arm. He rips back his shirt sleeve. CLOSE ON ASH'S ARM - STOP MOTION ANIMATION We can see the outline of Tiny Ash #6's body squirming down Ash's arm, just beneath the skin.watches in horror as...lands next to an iron vice. He reaches for the EVIL HAND. But the hand has grabbed a mallet that BONK-BONKS him on the head. Ash is groggy as he is grabbed by the hair and yanked down into the opened vice.with is head still wedged in the vice.Why you dirty little...AHHHHHH!! A PAIR OF IRON PLIERS has entered frame and clamps down upon Ash's nose. He emits a nasal SCREAM and shakes the pliers loose.Soon as I get out of this thingNo! Not the teeth!Where the hell are ya!?I can't see ya!!No, no--not the poke-- SSSSsssssssss!jerks his head free from the vice with a SCREAM. He holds up his iron hand. It's back to normal. Again under his control.Okay then. But he halts abruptly as he feels a strange sensation: His shoulder itches. He scratches it. The Itch grows. It itches madly. He rips back his shirt. Upon his shoulder... THERESHRIEKS and SHRIEKS and races out of the mill. The CAMERA follows him in docu-horror style as he flees into the dark woods. EXT. WOODS - 12MM LENSE - NIGHTstaggers about in a frenzy, stumbling over logs and through theDear God, it's growing bigger! THE PROTRUSION SWELLS AND GROWS LARGER.

He is now a man with two heads!I know better than to bury you whole. EXT. MILL WHEEL - LONG SHOT - NIGHT The giant blades of the Mill are illuminated with bright flashes of lightning.

Don't anybody try to take that away from him.finishes digging and lifts the bloody burlap sack. As he heaves the bag into the grave, the Evil Ash head spills out. INT.
