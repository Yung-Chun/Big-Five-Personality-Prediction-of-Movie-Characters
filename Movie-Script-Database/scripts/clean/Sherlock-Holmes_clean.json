{"Sherlock-Holmes": {"WATSON": {"raw_line": "The year was 1891. London was the capital of the world -- the height of modernity, with the hiss of steam and smell of coal in the air. It was also the great cesspool into which all the sinners and criminals of the empire drained.I had come to London, ten years prior, to find a life after the Afghan war. I had hoped to start a medical practice and settle into a nice, steady existence. The life I found was anything but nice and steady.And that had everything to do with one man. My friend, my partner, my burden...... Sherlock Holmes.Nice hat.Getting his troops in formation. Is that your blood or theirs?You left this behind.You did.Yeah, s'me.The girl.Lord Blackwood?! Blackwood applauds softly, strangely.Stay right there.It is.-- at the excellent work of Scotland Yard. As usual.71 over 104... very good, Captain.No -- ground floor. And there'll be a woman's touch, too.Let's give it a little longer, just to be safe. I'll be right back.You're not going in at all.He just needs a new case, that's all.I smell burning.Why don't you take Captain Philips and give him a nice cup of tea.And perhaps some tea and bread up here when you can.May I join you in the armory?It needs work. May I see?...It's been three months since the last case. About time you found another one.Paper?Let's see, we have a letter here from Mrs. Ramsey in Queen's Park -- her husband has gone missing.Yes, Holmes. Lady Radford reports a missing emerald bracelet.Yes, it's our last case together and I wanted to see it through to the end.Mr. Lewis is seeking...What have you done to Gladstone this time?Holmes! As your doctor...... and your friend, you've been in this room for two weeks. I insist you get out of here.So, you have nothing to do?Then you're free this evening.For dinner.The Royale.Mary's coming.You're meeting her, Holmes.I'm still looking for the right ring.It's happening, like it or not. Half past eight. The Royale.And wear a jacket.Holmes! You're early.May I present Miss Mary Morstan.It's true.Those days are behind me.I don't think that's necessary --Yes, well done. So shall we --There's nothing wrong with your face.Give us a few minutes, please.Holmes.Well done, old man.You know this is for eye surgery?It's a pathological amorbic process, it increases tissue change and weakness. And you know what a black reaction comes on you afterwards.Really? What about when you -- oops --Let's go. Lestrade wants you at Pentonville Prison.You're Blackwood's last request. Says he has information he'll give only to you.And your grand gift is the uncanny ability to demoralize people. I was aware she'd been engaged. She told me. Holmes rubs his jaw.That's my waistcoat.Well, it's my property and I want it back.You go ahead. I've no business with him while he's alive.Look at you, I can't believe you ran after her like a schoolboy again. Leaping about, all aflutter. Are you a masochist?Don't you remember what she did to you? She turned you inside out, she made a proper idiot of you. I'm sorry, you were going to explain something...I know, instead of just being tricked into being a witness at her wedding like last time --You dress up as clergyman and actually perform the ceremony. She'd love that.What's she after, anyway?Go on. I won't interrupt.What could she possibly need? An alibi, a beard, a human canoe. She can sit on your back and paddle you up the Thames...I've already read it. Luke Reordon, four foot ten, red hair, missing two front teeth.Case solved! You're just not her type, Holmes. She likes ginger dwarfs.So you agree?I've upset you, I can tell. I've said too much.Alright. What were you just doing?That's what I've been trying to do.Which is no mean feat.And yet she works for him. That's bad money. It's nothing to do with me, but leave this case.You know what, I've had just about enough --Us means you.Well that's clever seeing as how I pronounced him dead myself.I'll leave this one in your capable hands. I have tea with Mary and her parents this evening.Are you taking this seriously?Look at this mess. Nothing but standard-issue police bootprints. Any possible evidence there might have been has been trampled.He's in shock. We should give him a few moments.He had no pulse.Lividity is late stage. Diptera deposits are approximately -- -- three quarters of an inch, putting the time of death at ten to twelve hours ago.Missing two incisors in the upper jaw... Adler's midget.I fail to see how these fish and chips are different from the three other places we passed along the way.You know, I've seen things in war that I couldn't explain. I once heard a man predict his death, down to the number and placement of the bullet holes that killed him. You have to admit that a supernatural explanation is at least theoretically possible.The owner was most likely a drunk. Each time he wound the watch his hand would slip, hence the scratches.Pawnbroker's marks.Maddison and Haig.There's one thing you've missed. On the watch.The time. Which leads me to deduce that I'm already late for my appointment with Mary. You remember, the one I was leaving for before you talked me into coming to dig up dead bodies with you.No, thank you.You think you are clever don't you?Enough.This is a new low -- even for you.Do you still have my cut from the fight?Not bad, eh?I can spare ten minutes.Something did.Bloody hell...Appears he was attempting to follow occult formula with scientific practice.Has he any hydrochloric acid?Why would she hire you to find him, if she planned to do the job herself?Ferrocyanide. Sucks the iron right out of the ink. Long as it's not too burnt...He worked for Blackwood.Seems about fair.Holmes!I haven't slept all night. I deserve this... I clearly deserve it. How could I ever be so deluded as to believe I could meet Mary's parents for tea once I let myself be talked into going with you. Now of course I'm in jail.I've used the time to review my notes on our exploits of the last seven months... and I've come to the conclusion that I must be suffering from to some profound psychological aberration.Why else would I continually allow myself to be led into situations where you're deliberately withholding your intentions from me?I'm not complaining... I never complain... I never complain about your violin playing at three in the morning, your mess, your lack of hygiene, your stealing my clothes, your setting our home on fire!Who could forget that face? I told you, a little nitrate of silver and the warts will be gone in two weeks. Now, if you'll excuse us!What I do take issue with is your ruthless campaign to sabotage my relationship with Mary.If I were going to the country, I would be going with my future wife --No, Holmes. Not you. Me and her. You're not --There isn't any.Be my guest.Who was he?Really.Nine Elms.It's endless, he's had a hand in just about everything that's not good for you.Woolwich Arsenal... Limehouse Chemical... Queenshithe Slaughterhouse, Nine Elms!Not us, you.Same to you.Not again.Yes, I know. Don't give me that look, Gladstone.There must be fifty yards of mud out there.I know precisely how much money is in there.Oh, please.There was nothing honest about it.Come on, let's get this over with.Holmes. You need to see this.One-eighteen. It's a date, a time?Holmes...What are you administering?Are they subcutaneous, or deeper?Get a mirror, I'll extract them myself.I haven't time for that. My friend is in dire --It was worth a wound, worth many wounds...Interesting artwork. You look bloody awful.Took it out myself. Mary said I had a lousy doctor.Yes, oddly, it seems she might understand the power of partnership.It's half past nine.I brought you this...With your own venom no doubt.There's a new field in the treatment of abnormal personalities -- it's called psychology. It appears you're what's considered a para-neurotic deviant with anti-social proclivities. Quite severe. And untreatable.At minimum.Man, Ox, Eagle...And last on the list: the Lion. Holmes scribbles on a piece of paper. Watson and Irene step closer looking at the lion's fang and then the map...Parliament.It's right in the middle of the River Thames.How was Lestrade?Well, your instructions were fairly precise... about everything except the window.What are we doing in the sewers?You can tell that from here?Will be dead at the strike of noon.I'll keep these under wraps.Over there.You owe me for the ring.Hey!I'm pretty sure I heard the last chime.Which part? The stench of the sewers or the broken bones? My ankle's done.Where's Irene?Holmes, I'm sorry...One moment.Please make sure this one is put on the desk in the front room.Nothing really... Just a few scribbles... cases we've worked on over the years.I still can't believe he's given us that ring.Of course. No question about it --Suicide is not in his repetoire, he's far too fond of himself.Get on with it, Holmes.I hate to stop when he's on a roll. Do carry on, Holmes.How did you manage it, Holmes?Worse things could happen.But none of this explains the lack of a pulse.His heart should be ticking in no time.Point blank range.Where is Blackwood's device now?So you're saying Moriarty was after a part of the machine and not the poison.Adler was just a diversion.Well...There's a brave boy... There, there, everything's going to be all right.I'd wager there's a piece missing.Well...Take care of yourself, Holmes.", "clean_line": "year london capital world height modernity hiss steam smell coal air great cesspool sinners criminals empire drained come london years prior life afghan war hoped start medical practice settle nice steady existence life nice steady man friend partner burden sherlock holmes nice hat getting troops formation blood theirs left yeah girl lord blackwood blackwood applauds softly strangely stay right excellent work scotland yard usual good captain ground floor ll woman touch let little longer safe ll right going needs new case smell burning captain philips nice cup tea tea bread join armory needs work months case time paper let letter mrs ramsey queen park husband gone missing yes holmes lady radford reports missing emerald bracelet yes case wanted end mr lewis seeking gladstone time holmes doctor friend ve room weeks insist free evening dinner royale mary coming meeting holmes looking right ring happening like half past royale wear jacket holmes early present miss mary morstan true days think necessary yes shall wrong face minutes holmes old man know eye surgery pathological amorbic process increases tissue change weakness know black reaction comes oops let lestrade wants pentonville prison blackwood request says information ll grand gift uncanny ability demoralize people aware engaged told holmes rubs jaw waistcoat property want ahead ve business alive look believe ran like schoolboy leaping aflutter masochist remember turned inside proper idiot sorry going explain know instead tricked witness wedding like time dress clergyman actually perform ceremony love won interrupt possibly need alibi beard human canoe sit paddle thames ve read luke reordon foot red hair missing teeth case solved type holmes likes ginger dwarfs agree ve upset tell ve said alright ve trying mean feat works bad money leave case know ve means clever seeing pronounced dead ll leave capable hands tea mary parents evening taking seriously look mess standard issue police bootprints possible evidence trampled shock moments pulse lividity late stage diptera deposits approximately quarters inch putting time death hours ago missing incisors upper jaw adler midget fail fish chips different places passed way know ve seen things war couldn explain heard man predict death number placement bullet holes killed admit supernatural explanation theoretically possible owner likely drunk time wound watch hand slip scratches pawnbroker marks maddison haig thing ve missed watch time leads deduce late appointment mary remember leaving talked coming dig dead bodies thank think clever new low cut fight bad eh spare minutes bloody hell appears attempting follow occult formula scientific practice hydrochloric acid hire planned job ferrocyanide sucks iron right ink long burnt worked blackwood fair holmes haven slept night deserve clearly deserve deluded believe meet mary parents tea let talked going course jail ve time review notes exploits seven months ve come conclusion suffering profound psychological aberration continually allow led situations deliberately withholding intentions complaining complain complain violin playing morning mess lack hygiene stealing clothes setting home forget face told little nitrate silver warts gone weeks ll excuse issue ruthless campaign sabotage relationship mary going country going future wife holmes isn guest elms endless hand good woolwich arsenal limehouse chemical queenshithe slaughterhouse elms yes know look gladstone yards mud know precisely money oh honest come let holmes need eighteen date time holmes administering subcutaneous deeper mirror ll extract haven time friend dire worth wound worth wounds interesting artwork look bloody awful took mary said lousy doctor yes oddly understand power partnership half past brought venom doubt new field treatment abnormal personalities called psychology appears considered para neurotic deviant anti social proclivities severe untreatable minimum man ox eagle list lion holmes scribbles piece paper watson irene step closer looking lion fang map parliament right middle river thames lestrade instructions fairly precise window sewers tell dead strike noon ll wraps owe ring hey pretty sure heard chime stench sewers broken bones ankle irene holmes sorry moment sure desk room scribbles cases ve worked years believe given ring course question suicide repetoire far fond holmes hate stop roll carry holmes manage holmes worse things happen explains lack pulse heart ticking time point blank range blackwood device saying moriarty machine poison adler diversion brave boy going right wager piece missing care holmes"}, "HOLMES": {"raw_line": "My apologies. Send the bill to John Watson, 221B Baker Street.Head cocked to the left, partial deafness in right ear. First point of attack.Then throat, paralyze vocal chords, stop screaming.Stink of alcohol, heavy drinker -- knuckles to liver.Hhhmm, good cigar. Who do you work for?Watson. Perfect timing.Just got it. Where's Lestrade?I don't know. It's an old shirt.Knew I'd forgotten something. Thought I'd left the stove on.Right. Shall we?No.Look.Look.Impeccable timing, Lestrade.We've gone for the doctor... And one for the rope.If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse and chasing a rumor. Besides, the girl's parents hired me, not the Yard. I can't imagine why they thought you'd need any assistance.Some kind of ceremony. Five girls killed beneath cathedrals at the height of the full moon. The double circle's for his own protection.Bravo, Lestrade. Have a cigar.Please... Watson, I've been working on a device which will suppress the sound of a gunshot.Please... Don't, don't, don't...Gently, gently, Watson...I can't but agree. My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work. The sooner the better.He's in Belgium with the scullery maid. Is it December?Insurance swindle. Lord Radford likes fast women and slow ponies. I see you're the attending physician at Blackwood's hanging.There is only one case that intrigues me at present... the curious case of Mrs. Hudson, the absentee landlady.I have been studying her comings and goings and they appear most sinister.Is it poisoned, nanny?Don't touch that. Everything is in its proper place, as per usual.I was simply testing a new anesthetic. He doesn't mind.He'll be right as a trivet in no time.There's nothing of interest to me out there, on earth, at all.Nothing.Absolutely.Wonderful.My favorite.Not available.Have you proposed yet?Then it's not official.Fashionably.My pleasure. For the life of me I don't know why it's taken him so long to get us properly introduced.Oh, no no. The little details are by far the most important. Take Watson...... see that walking-stick? A rare African snakewood hiding a blade of high-tensile steel. A few were awarded to veterans of the Afghan war, so I can assume he's a decorated soldier. Strong, brave, born to be a man of action. And neat, like all military men. Then I check his pockets... ah. A stub from a boxing match. Now I can infer he's a bit of a gambler. I'd keep an eye on that, by the way.Yes, right behind you. He's cost us the rent more than once.You insist? She insisted. You're a governess.Your student's a boy of 8.It's breathing. Then he's tall for his age.He flicked ink at you today.There are two drops on your ear... India blue's nearly impossible to wash off, anyway. A very impetuous act by the boy, but you're too experienced to react rashly -- which is why the lady you work for lent you that necklace. It's from Asprey's, flawless, not the gems of a governess. However, the jewels you're not wearing tell us rather more.You were engaged.The ring is gone. But the lighter skin where it sat suggests you spent some time abroad wearing it proudly.Or at least until someone informed you of its true and rather modest worth, at which point you broke off the engagement and returned to England for better prospects. A doctor perhaps.She's lovely.Well done. Thank you.Not done. Finished. And as I said, thank you, it was most pleasurable.Hm. Plymouth gin.I find that it lifts my spirits.That's your job, not mine.Look at that structure. What has it been? Five years' work already? Are you aware that is the first combination of bascule and suspension bridge. Very innovative.Oh, I have your cut from last night, by the way. You weren't there so I laid your customary bet --You're right... I'll keep it with your check book, locked safely away in my drawer.The opera house is featuring Don Giovanni and I could easily procure two tickets if you had some cultural inclination this evening.You have the grand gift of silence, Watson. It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.So that's a `no' to the opera then?It's too small for you.Where are all the other prisoners?I'm sure I can find my own way from here, if you have other duties to attend to.Love what you've done with the place.A small point of concern.I'd already followed the murders with some interest and while my heart went out to the families of the victims, I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery in the stroke of your brush --However, by comparison, your work in the crypt was akin to a finger painting.Actually, my friend will pronounce you dead shortly and I thought I might keep him company.My only wish is that I'd caught you earlier. I might have spared five lives.I wonder if they'd let Watson and I dissect your brain -- after you're hanged, of course. I'd wager there's some deformity that would be scientifically significant. Then you would serve a greater purpose, too.I must say, you've come a long way down from the House of Lords.Bon voyage, Blackwood.Nothing.Don't think you're needed, Father. Not for this one.Simply studying your methodology for when the authorities ask me to hunt you down.But your signature is clear.Ah, the Maharajah's missing diamond. Another souvenir?And you, husbands. No ring?Should I answer chronologically or alphabetically?Who are you working for?Keep your money. I didn't say I'd take the case.Allow me to explain.Thank you, I --I don't believe --You've had your fun.Now it's time to press on.Now it's time to press on.It doesn't matter --Regrettably, we've had our last case together. Those are my dates.Midget!No, I don't agree. It's more than a technicality. You're misrepresenting the dimensions of foreshortened people.Will you allow me to explain.Now, that's the Irene I know.This man intrigues me, Watson. He's got Adler on edge.She's intimidated, scared...Well, I may not have a choice. A man has to make a living. After all, I'll be paying the rent entirely on my own.Clarky!What's he done now, lost his way to Scotland Yard? Watson, grab a compass. You means us.It is not my reputation at stake here.Like it or not, it's a matter of professional integrity. No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not.Watson, you'd do well to hide your medical certificates in case they're revoked.And the coffin?Inspector, do you know if this is a spruce or a sycamore?Now that we have a firm grasp of the obvious...Inspector, may I see your pen?All yours, Inspector.Scratches around the keyhole where the watch is wound. Most drunks are the same, and pawnbrokers scratch the ticket number and their initials inside the lid. This one has five, so the owner --Now the game is afoot, Watson.Trust me.Never theorize before you have data. Invariably, you end up twisting facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. Adler's midget is the key to this.Hmm... scratches around the keyhole, what does that tell you?Very good, Watson! You've developed considerable powers of your own.Let's see now, there are several sets of initials scored into the lid.Excellent.The most recent is M.H...I think not.Perhaps we do need a little help from the beyond.Do you have any changes?It's the most honest prediction old Flora has made in years. And you know it yourself, Watson. That is precisely the reason you can't find a suitable ring. You're terrified of a life without the thrill of the macabre, as well you should be.Why, do you --Reordon's lodgings should be right around this bend. Here we are...Looks promising. And possibly dangerous. Oh, well, give my regards to Mary.He clearly felt something was coming to get him.Watson, come take a look at this --Ammonium sulfate.Phosphorous... Formaldehyde... Hemlock...Irene was here.Maybe it's not the man she's after, but something else. Something he was working on?There's one odor I can't put my finger on. Sweet, almost like perfume... or sugar.... Barley sugar.Hello, gentlemen.Let me guess -- you're here to extinguish any connection between the man who lived here and the man you work for? Curious you'd still be running errands for a dead man.You take them, I'll handle Mr. Sweet tooth.You're not implying that I am responsible for our current situation are you, Watson? We were set upon, man, it was self- defense.You've never complained about my methods before.That was an accident...The first time WAS an accident...Ah, Mr. Brownlee. The fifteenth most dangerous man in London.Gladstone's my dog as well. It's in the interest of science.Watson, I completely understand now. You're overtired and feeling a bit sensitive.What you need is a rest. You and I could go out to the countryside. My brother Mycroft has a small estate near Chichester. It has marvelous grounds and a beautiful folly. We could throw a lamb on the spit.Certainly. We should have her along. Let's get Gladstone out of the house as well.Invited? Now you're not making any sense, Watson. Why would I not be invited to my own brother's country home?Lestrade -- your usual impeccable timing.And you, sir, an excellent policeman.All in good time.Who's this?As to where I am -- I was, admittedly, lost for a moment between Charing Cross and Holborn. But I was saved by the bread shop on Saffron Hill, the only bakers to use a certain French glaze on their loaves. After that, the carriage forked left, then right, a bump over the Fleet conduit -- need I go on?As to who you are -- that took every ounce of my not- inconsiderable experience and skill... the letters on your desk are addressed to Sir Thomas Rotheram, Lord Chief Justice. That would be your official title. Who you realy are is another matter entirely.Yes. They're almost interesting.Fear is the more infectious condition. In this case, fear of your own child.Blackwood is your son, yes? You have the same colored irises -- a rare dark green, with diamond- shaped hazel flecks ---- plus identical outer ears, or pinna, which only pass down through the direct bloodline, which would make you either brothers, or, more likely, father and son.Evidently.One of the great benefits of my work is that I can pick and choose my clients. I'll get him, but not for you.I have one last question, Sir Thomas.If the rest of his family's dead, why are you still alive?You can stop looking for Reardon.He was buried in Blackwood's tomb.I can't help wondering if your employer will be as content with these results? You were uncharacteristically ill at ease in his presence. Your hand was trembling, your gaze was averted. I couldn't see his face, but I spotted chalk on his lapel. A professor perhaps?But I've never known a professor to carry a gun, and on such a clever contraption.We're not.Tell me who you're working for and what he's after.When a man you ask me to find ends up dead in the coffin of the most notorious murderer since Jack the Ripper and that murderer manages to return from the dead, not only is it my business, it's the business of Scotland Yard and the highest levels of the British government. They will certainly consider your reticence to be an obstruction of justice. Which in relation to a crime of this magnitude would certainly mean prison time.So what's it to be?You're in over your head this time, Irene.How can you live like this -- always a fugitive.Don't take this the wrong way, but might I borrow your hand?Chambermaids were once such a liberal breed. Besides, she misinterpreted my intention entirely.Faith runs riot over reason.Crime is common, logic is rare. The decent thing to do is catch the killer, not provide comfort to the corpse.Hmm...What is that?Superb. I suspect this comes from a larger cannister. It'll either be in the pantry, high up where it's warm and dry, or in a linen closet with a vent. And, Constable, you could check the ground under the rear windows for any footprints not your own.Data, data, data! I cannot make bricks without clay!I have no idea what to make of that. Excellent work.Figure of speech.Since this room is no longer in use, do you mind if I employ it?Bring him in, boys.My new roommate. He's an inspiring conversationalist.No, he's your friend from Reordon's. He didn't survive Dredger landing on him. Poor fellow. But there is some consolation in the knowledge that he can still be of service to his fellow men.Elbows and arms stained with blood, but older than his own injuries. Plenty of it, layer on layer...Though none of it human.A butcher perhaps...? What else?Hm -- predominantly yellow flame, but with distinct green bursts. Sulfurous. He spent lots of time around industrial work and very little around a wash basin.Coal... river silt...That plus the river silt and industrial slag on his trousers puts him squarely in...Well done. Now, you didn't happen to pack the Lord's Register of members' interests, did you?Something brutal by the river...That's it, Watson! This should lead us right to Blackwood.Right. Well uh... best of luck with everything, then.Everything all right, Captain Tanner?Pull in at Vauxhall. Send for the police when you get there.It was an honest mistake --The one on the left seems more attentive, might prove easily distracted. The big one's been drinking -- whether for courage or from habit... Watson?They cleared something out of here, not minutes ago...It's chapter and verse. Revelation 1:18. `I am He that liveth, and was dead.'It's your turn in shackles this time.I've been meaning to ask you something --Ah. Yes. Do you still maintain you're not in over your head?You owe me information. No more games, Irene.Watson!WAATTTSSSSSONNN!!!!From Lord Coward?Thank you, Clarky.Watson...?What about the shrapnel in your arm?She brought you here?The fair sex was always your department, Watson.Thank you. You know, I dreamt that you were strangling me.What time is it?Excellent brew, but I believe my head requires something a bit stronger to clear the --Exactly.I need a map of London.Now that you're sitting comfortably, I shall begin. My initial approach was far too narrow. When Blackwood invited me to Pentonville prison, he suggested I widen my gaze and, at minimum, I have done just that. In fact, I may well have reconciled thousands of years of theological disparity. But that's for another time. Blackwood's method is based on a ritualistic mystical system that has been employed by The Temple of the Four Orders for centuries. To fully understand this system, to get inside it, I re-enacted the ceremony we interrupted in the crypt... with a few enhancements of my own.My journey took me somewhat further down the rabbit hole than I had intended.But I have emerged enlightened... The fraternity who silently control the Empire, share the belief with the Kings, Pharoahs, and Emperors of old that the Sphinx was a door to another dimension, a gateway to immeasurable power --It is made up of four parts: The Ox, the Lion, the Eagle, and Man --In Sir Thomas' secret chamber I found the bone of an ox, the tooth of a lion, the feather of an eagle, the hair of a man. Map!Now, it is a widely held belief that within the architecture of the great cities are coded references to this system.Since he rose from the grave, Blackwood has killed three men. Each murder was committed at a location that has a direct connection with the Temple, therefore the System. Reordon, the ginger midget, represents Man. We found his body here...Then Sir Thomas, Master of the Temple, wore the ox ring... he died here...The headquarters of Temple of the Four Orders where he died is here...Correspondingly, the map will tell us the location of Blackwood's final act. Right here.It is the fifth element -- the ethereal. That which can't yet be known.Ladies first.Follow these plans.Oh, that solves the great mystery as to how you became inspector.I'm curious, Coward, did you assist Blackwood in all the murders or just the one I prevented? Very distinctive those hand-made shoes of yours, but the price of quality is the unique imprint they leave.Nonetheless, I confess to being completely out-matched. I could deduce very little from my investigation.Fortunately, there is nothing more stimulating than a case where everything goes against you. How many members of parliament do you intend to murder at noon today? Man, ox, eagle, lion -- the lion is parliament, isn't it?No, but I don't care much what you think. I simply wanted to know the location of Blackwood's final ceremony, and now you have given it to me.A touch of red stock brick dust on your knee, from where you've been kneeling...A small bandage on your thumb from where you've been vowing...A faint aroma of excrement, from where you have been standing.You and Blackwood laid the final touches to your ceremony in the sewers beneath parliament less than an hour ago.Well there's no time to waste then, is there?Performed his role perfectly. A little too perfectly, come to think of it.Port side, Captain Tanner, into the sewers.Watson, did you bring my clothes?Trust me, have a drink.Patience, Doctor. I am about to show you...Behold, Blackwood's magic.A chemical weapon. The first of its kind. Cyanide, to be precise.No. I can tell it from here. He pulls something out of his pocket: the RAT TAIL.I snipped this off a rather recumbent rat at the slaughterhouse. Note the blue discoloration, the faint smell of bitter almonds. Tell-tale signs of cyanide.That shaft leads directly to Parliament. When activated, those electrodes on either side will send a charge converting the cyanide powder into a gas.As if by magic. There will be no one left to stop Blackwood and his followers from assuming control.Seven minutes to twelve...I wouldn't.Take this.There's never been anything like it. A totally wire-free weapon. He must have some kind of remote device sending a signal to the receiver. Really quite --Keep at it.Give me your gun. The bullets, I need the bullets.We need a light, a match --Yes... it was.Yes, we made it. Just.Come on, you've got to admit, you're going to miss this.Make sure Lestrade keeps it intact.Why hurry off, give it a try.There was never any magic. Only conjuring tricks.The simplest involved paying people off, like the prison guard...Who pretended to be possessed outside your cell. Your reputation and your jailers' fear did the rest. Others required more elaborate preparation, like the sandstone slab that covered your tomb. You had it broken before your burial then put back together using a mild adhesive. An ancient Egyptian recipe I believe -- a mixture of egg and honey. Designed to be washed away by the rain or eaten by animals. Arranging for your father to drown in his own bathtub required more modern science. Very clever of Reordon to find a paralytic that was activated by the combination of copper and water and was therefore undetectable once the bath water was drained.That might have been quite challenging had he not also tested it on some unfortunate amphibians. The death of Standish was a real mystery, until you used the same compound to blow up the wharf. An odorless, tasteless, flammable liquid -- yet it burned with an unusual pinkish hue. Did Standish mistake it for rain as he entered your Temple? All it took was a spark. A simple rigged bullet in his gun. Ingenious. Like all great performers you saved your piece de resistance for the end. Had it worked, your followers in Parliament would have watched unharmed as their colleagues were dying around them. They didn't know that you had given them the antidote -- at one of your ceremonies I suspect. Instead, they would have believed it was magic and that you harnessed the ultimate power.You hated your father and the other members of the Temple of the Four Orders for what they did to you. How satisfying it must have been to use their own system against them.You better hope that it's nothing more than superstition as you performed all the rituals perfectly.First, the world will see you for what you are. Then you will hang... properly this time.We'll see about that shall we.Oh, Irene...We've still got a moment.Sadly, yes.Thank you, Lestrade.She won't be by the time your boys get there.Good afternoon. I was trying to deduce the manner in which Blackwood survived his execution. Clearing your good name, as it were. But it had a surprisingly soporific effect and I was carried off in the arms of Morpheus, like a caterpillar in a cocoon.Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot was a hook -- I believe my legs have fallen asleep. I should probably come down.The executioner attached it to a harness, thus allowing the weight to be distributed around the waist and the neck to remain intact. My lord, I can't feel my cheeks. Might we continue this at ground level?I managed it with braces, belts and a coat hook. Please, Watson, my tongue is going next. I'll be of no use to you at all.There is a toxin refined from the nectar of the rhododendron ponticum. It is quite infamous in the region of Turkey bordering the Black Sea for its ability to induce an apparently mortal paralysis. Enough to mislead a medical mind even as tenacious and well-trained as your own. It is known locally as ---- mad honey disease.He is demonstrating the very effect I've just described. He doesn't mind.What is it this time, Clarky?Were there powder burns on his eyebrows?With small caliber bullet.Moriarty.I'd wager there's a piece missing.The wire-free invention was the game all along. Imagine being able to control any device simply by sending a command via radio waves.I'll leave with you. Clarky, case reopened.Were there powder burns on his eyebrows?Where is Blackwood's device now?Wager, Watson... I thought those days were behind you. Excellent deduction, however.Blackwood's wire-free invention was the game all along. It is undoubtedly the more dangerous and the more valuable of the two... Irene was just a diversion.I'll walk out with you...An honor working with you, Doctor.Magnificent woman, Watson.

And Watson as well.Tell me, doctor, as a medical man, how did you like my work? The fifth one was so scrawny, it was over before I'd finished the first incision.What a shame. That would've been fun.I've a request.I've a request.QUOTE from Revelations tbd...Thank you for joining me.How can I help?You're too kind.So now you're curious as to whether there's a larger game afoot, and that's why you're really here.Allow me to enlighten you. Your mistake is to imagine that anything earthly has led to this moment. Your error in judgement is to assume I've been holding the brush at all -- I am merely the channel.Those lives were a necessity, a sacrifice. Five otherwise meaningless creatures called to serve a greater purpose.Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze. I'm concerned you underestimate the gravity of coming events. For you and I are bound on a journey that will twist the very fabric of nature. I sense fragility beneath your mask of logic, and it worries me. Steel your mind, Holmes, I need you.But I will rise again.Pay attention! Three more shall die, and there is nothing you can do to save them.Death is only the beginning.Hello, Father...You can't fight it. It comes from a power greater than yours. You can only surrender.I've been imagining this moment for a long time...... I must admit, it's better than I thought it would be.Of course he does. It's why he's here.I am humbled. I am honored. My powers and my assets -- munitions, shipping, industry -- they were given to me for a purpose.A magnificent and simple purpose. A different future... a future ruled by us.You've made policy in secret for centuries. Now, you'll make it openly.The first act is a necessary one, for without death there can be no rebirth... ... at noon tomorrow, we will take the first step towards a new chapter in history. England will know our power. Then, the whole world will. Across the Atlantic lies a colony that was once ours, and will be again. Their civil war weakened them; their government is as corrupt and ineffective as ours. We'll take it from them. With their resources and our power, we'll remake the world, we'll create the future. Are you with me?They're limitless -- even death holds no sway.I wouldn't do that.Come, drink your allegiance here.You control the police. Use them.`And behold, I am alive forevermore, and have the keys of hell and of death. Amen.'I cautioned you to accept that this is beyond your control. Now you see the truth for yourself.I want you to bear witness. At noon tomorrow, the world as you know it ends.And because I appreciate your help, Holmes, I have a gift for you.She followed you. You led your little lamb straight to slaughter.And now it dawns on you, you begin to recognize your part in his play.You see the path he chose for you.Didn't you wonder why it was so easy to catch me? I told you I needed five lives for my resurrection. Why would I take a sixth under St. Paul's?Unless I simply wanted to be caught by the great Sherlock Holmes...... so I could die on the biggest stage of all. You made me what I am.You seem surprised. Did you really take me for a man who could be dispatched like a truculent servant? I see before me a conspiracy of arrogant old men puffed up by the illusion of their own vainglory. In your hands this once great parliament has become nothing more than a drunken satyr, stumbling about the world's stage seeking nothing more than to satiate your own lust and gluttony; your britches stained by the incontinence of your hypocrisy. I will not sit idly by and watch you violate the innocence of the public trust as you drag this great Empire into the quagmire that your pride has dug and filled with the excrement of your corruption. I am here to change all this.I am the fourth horseman.I am the pale rider.And my name to you is death.You're better off without her, Holmes!I planned to kill a handful of senile old men to make this empire strong... but now because of you thousands are going to die.All I have to do is break this cylinder. The wind will do the rest. And you'll be the first.Cut me loose, Holmes!We'll see about that shall we.

The witness is over there. You can question him if you like -- but you won't get much.If you lot don't stop behaving like a bunch of superstitious milk maids, you're on double-time! You're an embarrassment! Also, you're forbidden to talk about this to anyone, not a word. Are we bloody clear on that?The witness stated that he saw Lord Blackwood rise from the grave. Well?
