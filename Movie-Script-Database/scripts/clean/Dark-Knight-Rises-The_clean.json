{"Dark-Knight-Rises-The": {"GORDON": {"raw_line": "But I knew Harvey Dent. I was...his friend. And it will be a very long time before someone inspires us the way he did. Gordon, choked with emotion, gathers the papers of his eulogy. I believed in Harvey Dent. And we FADE TO BLACK.Congressman.Maybe the truth about Harvey isn't so simple, Congressman.The truth...? INSERT CUT: Harvey Dent, face half destroyed, threatens Gordon's son with a handgun.Maybe right now all you need to know is that there are a thousand inmates in Blackgate Prison as a direct result of the Dent Act. These are violent criminals, essential cogs in the organized crime machine that terrorized Gotham for so long. Maybe, for now, all I should say about Harvey Dent's death is this...it has not been for nothing. The figure on the balcony turns back into the mansion. People clap as Gordon leaves the mike. Gordon approaches Foley.The second shift reports in?That's your department.What's the problem, son?That's a job for the police?Old habits.What's your name, son?You have something you want to ask me, Officer Blake?What about it?I'm not hearing a question, son.I know exactly who he was. He was Batman.Let's go see about the Congressman's wife...Manhole!You three, down with me. You two, head down to cover the next exit -Get the DWP down here, now!We were in this together. Then you were gone...Built on a lie. Our lie. Now there's evil rising from where we tried to bury it. Nobody will listen... The Batman has to come back.He must. He must.Why?Get more men, work a grid. I want him found.This is good work. Lose the uniform - you're working for me now. We could use some hotter heads around here.You're a detective now, son, you're not allowed to believe in coincidence anymore. Blake tries to conceal his excitement from Foley.So you think our friend is gone again?What's happened?No more patrols, no more hide and seek. Send every available cop down there to smoke him out.Don't apologize for believing the world's in better shape then it is...just fight to make it true.Not you. You're telling me the Batman's gone. So you chase up the Daggett leads, any way you can.Anything strange about the pourings? Blake glances at a large map - dots mark pouring locations.But you know about patterns. Keep looking. Blake pulls up in front of a cement plant.Clear the corners, rookie. Blake turns. Gordon holds his service weapon. The Mercenaries are on the ground, dead.Get my coat, son.It means we're on our own. I have to get in front of a camera -The Mayor's dead. I'm the symbol of law and order. Bane says he's giving Gotham back to the people - they need to know that I could lead.Then he'll show his true colors.A lie to keep a city from burning to the ground. Gotham needed a hero, someone to believe in -There's a point. Far out there. When the structures fail you. When the rules aren't weapons anymore, they're shackles, letting the bad get ahead. Maybe one day you'll have such a moment of crisis. And in that moment, I hope you have a friend like I did. To plunge their hands into the filth so you can keep yours clean.We don't have any choice.Captain, glad to have you here.Dozens. I'd rather not say exactly. But the men trapped underground number almost three thousand.They've been getting water, food.They keep it on a truck - it must have a lead-lined roof. They move it constantly.They've got three of them. The routes don't vary much. Two Tumblers lead a massive black truck down the street. Captain Jones reaches into his jacket and triggers a Geiger counter. Shows Blake the display. Nods. One of the Tumblers stops, turns back. Blake leads them down a side street.No leads. It's a bluff - Bane wouldn't give control of that bomb to someone else.Captain, things are more complicated than you think. There's somebody you need to meet. Blake? Blake nods, leads Jones and his men up the stairs.Where the hell are they? It's not like we have a lot of time, here.The bomb goes off tomorrow. We've got about eighteen hours to do something.We mark that truck. Get a GPS on it, then we can start thinking about how to take it down. The door opens and Blake enters, followed by ten cops. Gordon is counting them in. He moves to Blake.Foley. Where's Foley, dammit?! Gordon heads for the door.You're sending your wife to the door when the city's under occupation?! Foley appears at the end of the corridor. Ashamed.What did you do, bury your uniform in the backyard?You forgotten all the years we went out on patrol with every gangbanger wanting to plant one as soon as our backs were turned?Deal?! Bane's got their balls in a vice. That's not a deal -You think he's given control of that bomb to one of 'the people'?! You think this is part of some revolution? There's one man with his finger on the button - Bane.This only gets fixed from inside the city, Foley. Look, I'm not asking you to walk down Grand in your dress blues. But we've got to do something before this maniac blows us all to hell.Keep your head down? What's that gonna do tomorrow, when that thing blows?Miss Tate, I can't ask you -Bruce Wayne built it.Let's go.Stay further up the block. They're gonna cross the street and try and slow the truck down. As it approaches, hit this button. If the needle hits two hundred - give me the signal and I mark the truck. Okay?Got it.On whose authority?No lawyer, no witnesses. What sort of due process is this?Crane, if you think we are going willingly out onto that ice, you've got another think coming.Looks that way.When what starts?Come on, come on...That's impossible... Come on! Cut over to Fifth!Give me a hand! The Bat lands at the tunnel mouth. Gordon moves in to try and grab the core but it is too hot. Let's get a cable on it and drag it out! Come on, we're almost there - Laughter. Gordon turns. Talia, lying half out the truck. Dying.What're you doing?So this is the part where you vanish, only this time you don't come back?I never cared who you were -But shouldn't the people know the hero who saved them?Bruce Wayne? - but is dusted by downdraft as the Bat RISES. Gordon LEAPS out of the way as the core is dragged along and out of the tunnel mouth.'I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss...' Blake pulls out his badge. Throws it into the river.'I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy...''I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence. It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done...' Gordon closes the book, looking down at Bruce Wayne's grave. 'It is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.'Can I change your mind about quitting the force?They know.

What matters is our plan.It would be extremely painful.For you.Of course. Dr. Pavel refused our offer in favor of yours. We had to know what he told you about us.He would not have told us.Him, I need healthy. You present no such problem. CIA Man laughs for the Special Forces' benefit. A heavy bass tone is rising. The Sergeant looks out the window.Crashing this plane...Friend. They expect one of us in the wreckage. The man nods, unhooks himself, takes Bane's arm.Calm, Doctor. Now is not time for fear... Bane slides Dr. Pavel out of his seat. They hang in the vertical, windblown cabin. Bane takes out a detonator.That comes later. Bane presses the detonator - the cabin drops from around them, revealing the terrifying drop to the peaks below. Dr. Pavel screams as they are hoisted up towards the transport, and we -Why are you here? The Thugs drop Gordon at Bane's feet.I'm asking you.And you brought him down here?You panicked. And your weakness costs three lives.Search him. Then I will kill you. The Thug, terrified, pulls out Gordon's badge, wallet, gun...and the folded papers of the speech he did not read. Bane takes these one by one with quick glances. He stops at the papers. Unfolds them...Then show me his body.Give me your GPS. Lead Mercenary hands him a GPS - Bane tucks it into Thug 2's jacket, zips it up like a mother sending her kid to school.Follow him.Track him. Make sure both bodies will not be found. Then brick up the south tunnel.Why else would you people be here? Bane grabs Trader 1 by the throat and drags him across the floor to an online automated trades terminal... He puts the man's thumb onto the print reader - the screen lights up.Enter your password. Or I send these men to your home.For now. How much longer does the program need?Time to go mobile. Shoeshine Man picks up the laptop, slips it into his pack...Speak of the devil... Daggett turns. Bane is already there....and he shall appear.The plan is proceeding as expected.Do you feel in charge? Daggett is taken aback. Stryver leaves.And that gives you power over me?Your money and infrastructure have been important. Till now.Gotham's reckoning. Come to end the borrowed time you've all been living on...I am necessary evil. Stryver, on the steps outside the living room, flinches.Not as serious as yours, I fear. Batman turns. Bane emerges from behind the waterfalls.Let's not stand on ceremony here, Mr. Wayne.Peace has cost you strength. Victory has defeated you.Theatricality and deception are powerful agents...to the uninitiated. Batman lashes out at Bane - Bane counters - they separate.But we are initiated, aren't we, Bruce? The League of Shadows. And you betrayed us...Now I am the League of Shadows, here to fulfill R\u00af's al Gh\u00afl'sYou fight like a younger man. Nothing held back. No reserves. Admirable. But mistaken. Batman hits a switch on his belt - the lights go out - Bane turns slowly addressing all the shadows at once.You think darkness is your ally. But you merely adopted the dark. I was born in it. Formed by it...I didn't see the light until I was already a man. And by then it was nothing to me but blinding...The shadows betray you, because they belong to me...I will show you where I've made my home while preparing to bring justice. Then...I will break you.Your precious armory. Gratefully accepted. We will need it.I wondered which would break first - your spirit...You don't fear death. You welcome it. Your punishment is to be more severe.Yes. But not of your body. Of your soul. Wayne exhales. Eyes losing focus from sheer pain.Home.This meeting is called to order. Fox and Miranda freeze. Staring at the mask.Chair and President. I also need one ordinary member - Mr. Fox, would you care to nominate?Where you buried your resources. The bowels of Gotham.Turn it on.I only need one other board member. There are eight more waiting upstairs.Do your work. Bane turns to his men. Gestures at the hostages. Take them to the surface. People of their status deserve to see the next era of western civilization. Fox, Miranda and Fredericks are led back into the rubble.Pull the core out of the reactor.Five, by my calculations.For the sake of your family, Dr. Pavel, I hope so.Let the games begin. The Mercenaries hit the detonators.Gotham, take control of your city...This is the instrument of your liberation...Identify yourself to the world.Tell the world what this is.And who can disarm this device?Thank you, Doctor. Bane snaps Dr. Pavel's neck in front of the world.The bomb is armed, the bomb is mobile, the identity of the triggerman is a mystery. One of you holds the detonator - we come not as conquerors, but as liberators to return control of this city to the people. At the first sign of interference from the outside world or of people attempting to flee, this anonymous Gothamite, this unsung hero, will trigger the bomb. For now, martial law is in effect. Return to your homes, hold your families close, and wait. Tomorrow you claim what is rightfully yours. Bane turns, leaves the field, followed by his men.Behind you stands a symbol of oppression. Blackgate Prison...Where a thousand men have languished for years. Under the Dent Act. Under the name of thisHarvey Dent. Held up to you, and over you, as a shining example of justice and good...But they supplied you a false idol. A straw man. To placate. To stop you tearing down this corrupt city......and rebuilding it the way it should have been rebuilt generations ago...Let me tell you the truth about Harvey Dent. In the words of Gotham's Police Commissioner, James Gordon...'The truth about Harvey Dent is simple in only one regard - it has been hidden for too long. After his devastating injuries, Harvey's mind has recovered no better than his mutilated face. He was a broken, dangerous man, not the crusader for justice that I, James Gordon, have portrayed him to be for the last eight years. Harvey's rage was indiscriminate. Psychopathic. He held my family at gunpoint, then fell to his death in the struggle over my son's life. The Batman did not murder Harvey Dent - he savedmy boy. Then took the blame for Harvey's appalling crimes, so that I could, to my shame, build a lie around this fallen idol.''I praised the madman who tried to murder my own child.''The things we did in Harvey's name brought desperately needed security to our streets... But I can no longer live with my lie. It is time to trust the people of Gotham with the truth, and it is time for me to resign.'Do you accept the resignation of all the liars?! All the corrupt?! More and more of the crowd is chanting 'Yes!'We take Gotham from the corrupt. The rich. The oppressors of generations who've kept you down with the myth of opportunity. And we give it to you, the people. Gotham is yours - none shall interfere. Do as you please...But start by storming Blackgate and freeing the oppressed... Step forward, those who would serve...For an army will be raised... Mercenaries hand out weapons to escaping Prisoners...The powerful will be ripped from their decadent nests......and cast into the cold world the rest of us have known and endured...Courts will be convened...The spoils will be enjoyed...Blood will be shed...But the police will live, until they are ready to serve true justice...This great city will endure... Close enough to see the flickering digits of its countdown...Gotham will survive. Mercenaries load the core into the back of a black truck.I'm on your schedule, Captain.Give them over for judgement. Hang them where the world will see.Bring her to me.Impossible...Open fire.You came back. To die with your city.Stay back. He is mine - Bane SMASHES Batman's head - moves in for the kill, but Batman SMASHES Bane to the ground, RIPS sideways across the tubes of Bane's mask with the blades of his forearm. Bane bellows, thrashing in AGONY. Batman holds him down with a hand on his throat - searches him with his free hand.I broke you. How have you come back?I never escaped - R\u00af's al Gh\u00aflGoodbye.

Alfred places a glass of water on a tray next to a covered plate. Picks up the tray, looks around the chaotic kitchen.Where's Mrs. Bolton?The East drawing room. Unlock the door, place the tray on the table, lock the door again. Nothing more.I'm sorry, Miss Tate, but I've tried. He won't see you.Mr. Wayne is as determined to ignore important things as trivial ones.The Dent Act is about all Gotham. Even you, Mr. Daggett. Miss Tate, always a pleasure. Alfred turns and walks off. Daggett smiles, glib.Miss Tate was asking to see you again.And quite lovely, in case you were wondering.What are you doing?And this is your idea of raising the alarm?She?Perhaps you should learn to make your own bed, then. Why are you dusting for prints?Master Wayne? Alfred's voice echoes through the vast mansion. No reply.You haven't been down here in a long time...She may be. But we have the trace on the necklace.We should send the police before she fences the pearls.What was she after?Fascinating. Maybe you should exchange notes over coffee.At this point, sir, I would set you up with a chimpanzee if I thought it would bring you back into the world.And that's the problem. You hung up the cape and cowl, but never moved on. You won't get out there and find a life. Find someone -I know. And then you lost them. That's part of living, sir. But you're not living - you're waiting. Hoping for things to go bad again.I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take unscheduled calls. Even from police officers.Ran it through some databases. He's a mercenary. No other known name. Never been seen or photographed without a mask. He and his men were behind a coup in West Africa that secured mining operations for our friend John Daggett.It would seem so. I'll keep digging.The Foundation is funded from the profits of Wayne Enterprises... There have to be some.I'll get him on the phone -Which hospital, sir?Just you, sir?Don't worry, Master Wayne. Takes a little time to get back into the swing of things. Wayne dials his phone.You've got the wrong leg, sir.It is terribly painful?Happy watching, thank you, sir. Wayne shouts as the brace clicks home. He gets to his feet.Master Wayne, if you're considering going back out there you need to hear some rumors surrounding Bane.There is a prison. In a more ancient part of the world. A pit. Where men are thrown to suffer and die. But sometimes, a man rises from the darkness. Sometimes...the pit sends something back.Born and raised in a hell on earth.No one knows why. Or how he escaped. But they know who trained him one he did...R\u00af's al Gh\u00afl. YourHe plucked Bane from a dark corner of the earth and trained him in the blackest disciplines of combat, deception and endurance. Just like you.Until he was excommunicated. And a man considered too extreme for R\u00af'sThat was then. And you can strap up your leg and put the mask back on. But it won't make you what you were.Someone whose anger at death made him value all life. Even his own.Yes, this city needs Bruce Wayne. Your resources, your knowledge...not your body. Not your life. That time has passed.You can fail as Bruce Wayne. As Batman, you can't afford to.No. I'm afraid that you want to. Wayne looks at Alfred. Then turns to examine the Batsuit.Very inconspicuous. Shall I tell the neighbors you got yourself a new leaf-blower?From the look of the television coverage, you seem to have your taste for wanton destruction back.Shouldn't the police be gathering the evidence?They would if you gave them to themIn your mind, perhaps. But there aren't many things you couldn't turn into a weapon.Perhaps they would've if you haven't made a sideshow of yourself.Wrong?You don't. You lead a bloated police force on a merry chase with some fancy new toys from Fox. What about when you come up against him. What then?When you had something to fight for. What are you fighting for now? Not your life. Wayne moves to switch off the monitor. Alfred grabs his hand.Take a good look. At his speed, his ferocity, His training. I see the power of belief. Of the fanatic. I see the League of Shadows resurgent.By R\u00af's al Gh\u00afl. Who leads themIs that -?I'll get this to Fox. But no more. Wayne hears his tone of voice. Turns to him.I've sewn you up and set your bones...but I won't bury you. I've buried enough members of the Wayne family.You see only one end to your story. Leaving is all I have to make you understand: you aren't Batman anymore - you have to find another way. You used to talk about finishing. About life beyond that awful cave -What if he had? What if she wasn't intending to make a life with you?What if, before she died, she'd written a letter? Explaining that she'd chosen Harvey Dent over you? Wayne watches, confused, as the old man prepares to say -And what if, to spare you pain...I'd burned that letter? Wayne stares at Alfred, shocked.Because I have to make you understand.Because you are as precious to me as you were to your own mother and father and I swore to them that I would protect you and I haven't.I've never lied to you. Except when I burned Rachel's letter. Wayne turns on the old man, furious.I'm using the truth, Master Wayne. Maybe it's time we all stopped trying to outsmart the truth and just let it have its day. I'm sorry.No. I know what this means -It means your hatred. It means losing the person I've cared for ever since I heard his first cries echo through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important.I'm so sorry. I failed you. You trusted me, and I failed you.

I retired, Lucius.That's good -The Batman wasn't needed anymore. We won.What if he doesn't exist anymore?I'm not sure if my assistant put me on the guest list -Miss Tate, isn't it?True. Proceeds go to the big fat spread, not the cause. It's not about charity, it's about feeding the ego of whichever society hag laid it on.Oh.That's very generous of you.Sometimes the investment doesn't pay off. Sorry.Mind if I cut in? Rich Twit turns, annoyed - Wayne hands him his cane. Takes Selina by the waist. She glares at him.You don't seem very happy to see me.Felt like some fresh air.I have a powerful friend who deals with this kind of thing. Brazen costume for a cat burglar.Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire. Who's your date?It's pronounced 'Ibeetha'. You wouldn't want these folks realizing you're a crook not a social climber.I doubt you care what anyone in this room thinks about you.Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came here from your walk-up in Old Town - modest place for a master jewel thief.

Wayne swaps the brace to his bad knee. Puts his weight on it - the knee bends, kicks. He sits again. Cautious. Now we tighten it up.Not bad - Wayne executes a perfect roundhouse, knocking out a brick. Not bad at all.I'm all ears.Bane.Born in a prison?Bane was a member of the League of Shadows.I didn't realize I was known for trifling with criminals.Which was?If this man is all the things you say he is, then this city needs me. The Batsuit emerges from the cube.I tried helping as Bruce Wayne, Alfred. And I failed.That's what you're afraid of - that if I go back out there I'll fail.We bought all the neighbors. Alfred takes the cowl from him, then the cape, as they walk.I retrieved this.They don't have the tools to analyze it.One man's tool is another man's weapon.Alfred. Enough. The police weren't getting it done -Perhaps you're upset you were wrong.You thought I didn't have it in me. Alfred looks at him. Puts down the cape and cowl.I'll fight harder, I always have.You said he was excommunicated.R\u00af's al Gh\u00afl was the League ofTrades of some kind. Coded... The screen blanks, a thumb print appears.Mine. Courtesy of Selina Kyle.You'd abandon me?Rachel died knowing we'd decided to be together. That was my life beyond this cave and I can't just move on. She didn't. She couldn't.She was, I can't change that -Why would you say such a thing?You're lying.You're lying!How dare you use Rachel to stop me!Sorry?! You expect to destroy my world, then shake hands?!What does it mean, Alfred?!Goodbye, Alfred.Alfred? But Alfred is gone.Yes. Could you decode the trades on that drive?The weapons - we can't let Daggett get his hands on Applied Sciences -Miranda Tate. We need to convince the board to get behind her. Let's show her the reactor -I thought you might like to see what your investment built.If it worked. It doesn't. Wayne leads Miranda to the core. Two perpendicular rings of electromagnets suspend a bowling-ball-sized mass of metal. Wayne hits buttons - the ball glows, then dies to cold.Ignition, yes. But no chain reaction.Miranda, if it were operational, the danger to Gotham would be too great.Someone else will work out what Dr. Pavel did. Someone else will figure out how to turn this power source into a nuclear weapon. I need you to take control of Wayne Enterprises and this reactor.Nothing. Until we can find a way to guarantee its safety.Decommission it. Flood it.If the world's not ready. Yes.I'm trusting you.I could've flooded this chamber any time in the last three years. I'm choosing to trust you, Miranda, and that's not the easiest thing for me. Please. His eyes are genuine. Pleading. Miranda nods.I understand. Ladies and gentlemen.To protect the people closest to me.There are always people you care about. You just don't realize how much until they're gone. The idea was to be a symbol. Batman could be anybody, that was the point.Not everybody agrees.Got anything on Bane's whereabouts?Don't wait. I'll get a cab.Actually, no. Blake hands him some bills, watches him cross the street. The radio squawks. Blake reacts - drives off.I don't think so.Actually, they're letting me keep the house.Vacation?My powerful friend hopes to change your mind about leaving.By giving you what you want.He says it does. He wants to meet. Tonight.He needs to find Bane. He thinks you'd know how.No, you're not.No. I'm on my own now.Never needed them... She takes his hand.Hope you don't like me for your money. Miranda kicks off her shoes. Glances at the paper.He left. Taking everything. Miranda puts the photo down. Kisses him. Passionately. Then again. He kisses back. Suddenly the lights go out.You're pretty good at that.I assumed your family was wealthy.I've made a few myself. She turns to him, tracing the scars across his chest.Someday perhaps. Not tonight. She pulls him close. He kisses her. They fold into each other, the warm heart at the center of a vast, cold room.Why didn't you just kill me?Where am I?Do it for the pleasure.Has anyone made it?What does he say?Bane.Don't.How would he know?How?Is Bane the child you spoke of? Was he born here?How -?I watched you die.You were the mercenary. Bane is your child. Your heir. INSERT CUT: the Mercenary at the side of the road. R\u00af's.No...I'm not meant to die in here. The Prisoner indicates the TV:You told me a child did it...My body makes the jump.My soul's as ready to escape as my body.I'm not afraid. I'm angry.Why?I do fear death. I fear dying in here while my city burns with no one there to save it.How?Pretty generous, for a thief. Selina recognizes the voice. Turns to find Wayne - strong, but weathered. Beard, work clothes.Not yet.It wouldn't suit you. I need your help.For this. The 'Clean Slate'.I admit I felt a little let down. But I still think there's more to you. In fact, I think for you - this isn't a tool, it's an escape route. You want to disappear. Start fresh.I can give you a way off. Once you've gotten me to Lucius Fox. I need you to find out where they're holding him. Then take me in.To save this city.Maybe you do. But tomorrow that bomb's going off.I'm trying. But I need Fox.How long until the core ignites?Unless we can connect it to the reactor.Not tonight. I'm sorry.To get me back in the game. Catwoman comes down the stairs with the Thugs.I won't forget about you.Any move I make against Bane or the bomb - the triggerman sets it off.Could you block it?Even without the autopilot...", "clean_line": "beautiful necklace reminds belonged mother pearls safe reaches cane press open panel bureau revealing safe door manufacturer clearly explained uncrackable afraid let persistent wasn examining print dust ve robbed maids stop letting house trying jewel thief ran prints photos handled wayne pulls mug shot fat male armed robbery suspect wearing fingerprints good cross referenced address went police data high end good ground shrinking beneath feet won likes weren fingerprints printer toner mixed graphite safe gives good pull untraceable trying set jewel thief officer sorry hear shouldn telling superior officers commissioner gordon thinks batman bad waywhy boys home funded wayne foundation checked bane daggett brought wayne foundation stop funding boys homes city time talk mr fox think cars place need appointment hospital leg whichever jim gordon haven lost sense humor lost money options lucius lucius ll think retired figured shut place new stuff fine use gets days showing called wrong better mind told retired lucius good batman wasn needed anymore won exist anymore sure assistant guest list miss tate isn true proceeds big fat spread cause charity feeding ego whichever society hag laid oh generous investment pay sorry mind cut rich twit turns annoyed wayne hands cane takes selina waist glares happy felt like fresh air powerful friend deals kind thing brazen costume cat burglar bruce wayne eccentric billionaire date pronounced ibeetha wouldn want folks realizing crook social climber doubt care room thinks selina kyle know came walk old town modest place master jewel thief means saving retirement deep wrong people actually born regency room start fresh achievements think justifies stealing robin hood maybe assuming ouch sounds like looking forward pearls look better safe likely lost ticket wife remember unusual requests start good limb learns optimum muscle patterns wayne swaps brace bad knee puts weight knee bends kicks sits cautious tighten bad wayne executes perfect roundhouse knocking brick bad ears bane born prison bane member league shadows realize known trifling criminals man things city needs batsuit emerges cube tried helping bruce wayne alfred failed afraid ll fail bought neighbors alfred takes cowl cape walk retrieved tools analyze man tool man weapon alfred police weren getting upset wrong thought alfred looks puts cape cowl ll fight harder said excommunicated al gh league oftrades kind coded screen blanks thumb print appears courtesy selina kyle abandon rachel died knowing decided life cave couldn change thing lying lying dare use rachel stop sorry expect destroy world shake hands mean alfred goodbye alfred alfred alfred gone yes decode trades drive weapons let daggett hands applied sciences miranda tate need convince board let reactor thought like investment built worked wayne leads miranda core perpendicular rings electromagnets suspend bowling ball sized mass metal wayne hits buttons ball glows dies cold ignition yes chain reaction miranda operational danger gotham great work dr pavel figure turn power source nuclear weapon need control wayne enterprises reactor way guarantee safety decommission flood world ready yes trusting ve flooded chamber time years choosing trust miranda easiest thing eyes genuine pleading miranda nods understand ladies gentlemen protect people closest people care realize gone idea symbol batman anybody point everybody agrees got bane whereabouts wait ll cab actually blake hands bills watches cross street radio squawks blake reacts drives think actually letting house vacation powerful friend hopes change mind leaving giving want says wants meet tonight needs bane thinks know needed takes hand hope like money miranda kicks shoes glances paper left taking miranda puts photo kisses passionately kisses suddenly lights pretty good assumed family wealthy ve turns tracing scars chest someday tonight pulls close kisses fold warm heart center vast cold room kill pleasure bane know bane child spoke born watched die mercenary bane child heir insert cut mercenary road meant die prisoner indicates tv told child body makes jump soul ready escape body afraid angry fear death fear dying city burns save pretty generous thief selina recognizes voice turns wayne strong weathered beard work clothes wouldn suit need help clean slate admit felt little let think fact think isn tool escape route want disappear start fresh way ve gotten lucius fox need holding save city maybe tomorrow bomb going trying need fox long core ignites connect reactor tonight sorry game catwoman comes stairs thugs won forget bane bomb triggerman sets block autopilot"}, "BLAKE": {"raw_line": "I didn't want to bother you up here, but they're looking for you.Congressman Gilly's wife's been calling. He hasn't made it home from the Wayne Foundation event.Sir, I've been a cop for a year and I've only logged half a dozen arrests. When you and Dent cleaned the streets you cleaned 'em good. Pretty soon we'll be chasing overdue library books. Gordon smiles at this. Blake looks at his stack of files.But here you are. Like we're still at war...Or instinct.Blake, sir.It's that night. This night, eight years ago. The night Dent died.The last confirmed sighting of the Batman. He murders those people, takes out two SWAT teams, breaks Dent's neck...then just vanishes?Don't you want to know who we was? Gordon turns to look at the broken searchlight. He brushes his fingers across its rusted shell.Name's Jimmy. He's at St. Swithin's. The boys home where I...I coach some ball.Why?The Wayne Foundation gives money for that -He has a brother here, right?I'd like to, if that's okay.I'm sorry.What was he doing in the tunnels?What kind of work are you gonna find in the sewers?It's okay, Miss. It's okay.They went down there?Come on, we gotta get down there -Gas? This is a sewer!We know what's down there, sir. The Police Commissioner!I need to see Bruce Wayne.And if I go get a warrant, in the investigation of Harvey Dent's murder? Would that still count as unscheduled?Commissioner Gordon's been shot.He chased a gunman down into the sewers. When I pulled him out he was babbling about an underground army. A masked man called 'Bane'.I did. One of them asked if he saw any giant alligators down there. He needs you. He needs the Batman.He doesn't know or care who you are. But we've met before. When I was a kid. At the orphanage. See, my mom died when I was small. Car accident, I don't really remember it. But a couple of years later my dad was shot over a gambling debt. I remember that just fine. Not a lot of people who know what it feels like, do they? To be angry. In your bones. People understand, foster parents understand. For a while. Then they expect the angry kid to do what he knows he can never do. To move on. To forget.So they stopped understanding and sent the angry kid to a boys' home - St. Swithin's. Used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation. See, I figured it out too late. You have to hide the anger. Practice smiling in the mirror. Like putting on a mask. You showed up one day in a cool car, pretty girl on your arm.We were so excited - Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan. We made up stories about you. Legends. The other boys' stories were just that. But when I saw you I knew who you really were... I'd seen that look on your face. Same one I taught myself. Blake gets up to leave. Wayne is lost in thought.I don't know why you took the fall for Dent's murder, but I'm still a believer in the Batman. Even if you're not.Because the money stopped. Might be time to get some fresh air and start paying attention to the details. Some of those details might need your help.Move it, now! We've got a situation.That way! Blake points - but SWAT vehicles pile in, blocking.Get in your vehicle and stay there! Foley and the SWAT Commander, Allen, approach the entrance. The Market Security Chief walks up, frantic.What's that?Sir, what about the armed robbers?But he's getting away!Are you sure that was him? Foley looks at Blake. Thrusts the loudhailer at him.Looks like you need a lift. Wayne turns to see Blake standing by his patrol car. Nods.When you began...why the mask?You're a loner with no family.It was damn good to see him back.They'll figure it out in the end.Yeah, I've got five hundred pages of tunnel records and a flashlight. I could use some help.You got money?John Daggett's body was found in a dumpster an hour ago. I thought you might like to know.Because Daggett's name is all over the permits I pulled to map the tunnels under Gotham. Blake hands Gordon a stack of files. Foley glares at Blake.MTA maintenance, sewer construction...This could just be a coincidence.I showed your picture to the Congressman and guess what?Head over heels. Pressing charges, though. Blake lays a police file down with a thump. You've made some mistakes, Ms. Kyle.You have an appetite. Why run? You can't hide from us with this record.Who then? Bane? What do you know about him?We can offer you protection... Selina looks at him with contempt. Blake shrugs, switches off the tape, moves to the door.When I spotted you, I was looking for a friend...Bruce Wayne. Selina turns to look at Blake. His eyes plead with her.Did they kill him?So it's a training exercise.I've been to half Daggett's cement plants, logged locations they've poured for underground construction...Honestly, Commissioner, I don't know anything about civil engineering.Hey. The Driver turns.That was you outside the stock exchange, right?When? When half the city's cops were trying to pull onto Castle Street and your truck shut them out.Detective, now.And as a detective...I'm not allowed to believe in coincidencesWhat were you doing?! What?!Commissioner, I'm at the Fourteenth Street plant with two dead witnesses and a lot of questions. Call me -Oh, God.Patch me into Foley!They're heading into a trap!It's a trap! Pull everyone out! Bane's been pouring concrete laced with explosives -There's a ring around the tunnels - they're gonna blow it and trap the cops underground! Foley looks up with dread at the mouth of the tunnel.Foley?What does that mean?Sir, they'll kill you the second you show your face -Bane's not gonna let that happen -And you'll be dead.We're gonna keep moving you, till we can get you in front of a cameraThese men, locked up in Blackgate for eight years, denied parole under the Dent Act. Based on a lie.Not as much as it does now. But you betrayed everything you stood for.Your hands look pretty filthy to me, Commissioner.For the bus in case there's a chance to evacuate. Keep it in here - people are siphoning parked cars.Less you know, Father. How're the boys?Yes, sir - take out the mercenaries guarding the outflow south of Ackerman Park, blow the rubble, you've got a hole big enough for ten at a time. I'm in contact with my partner - they're waiting for the day.Men with automatic weapons who haven't seen daylight in three months.While Gotham lives under a warlord, like in some failed state?I was up here looking for a vantage point. Found the people who run the corporation who owns it living here.Captain, meet Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox, I'd like you to brief the Captain. Captain Jones indicates Miranda.And here's the important part.The bomb's a time bomb.Bane's revolution is a sham. He's watching Gotham rearrange its deckchairs while the whole ship's going down. Your appeasement plan might not be as practical as you thought. Captain Jones throws Blake a look. Addresses Fox.Fox, somebody sold us out! Fox and Miranda burst into the corridor.You shouldn't be out on the streetsYou missed a spot. Batman boots him in the head as he moves towards Blake.No one cares who I am.Huh. And you always seem to know where those people are. How is that?No offense, but you got anything bigger in that belt?But how do we -? KAABOOOM! The Bat's cannons light up the night.Okay.What now?Why?Don't you need me here?Thank you.I might not get a chance later.Knock on doors, spread the word - the bomb's going to blow! Get out by the South Street tunnel, or over the bridge! Do two blocks, then get back to the bus! The boys race down the street. Father Reilly climbs into the bus.It's gonna blow anyway. We need this bridge open right now.Whose orders? Bane's?Haven't you heard the shooting? The Batman's battling it out with BaneIt's Detective -Wait for me back at the bus. The Boys walk back down the bridge...Your orders are out of date! The situation's changed! Listen, I'm a cop like you. And I'm walking out there. Please don't shoot me. Blake walks. Shots ring out at his feet. He keeps walking...You idiots! You sons of bitches! You're killing us!!Father! Get the boys on the bus -Come on! On the bus!Protection from the blast -You think they need to hear that in their last seconds? You think I'm going to let them die without hope?Heads down! Heads down, now!They're children! They have no peace to make - An EXPLOSION from downtown Gotham. Blake looks across, startled, turns to the children on the bus. Get down! This is it! The smallest of the boys stares through the window past Blake.No. What you said about structures. About shackles. I can't take it. The injustice. I mean...no one's ever going to know who saved an entire city.Blake, John.Try my legal name.", "clean_line": "want bother looking congressman gilly wife calling hasn home wayne foundation event sir ve cop year ve logged half dozen arrests dent cleaned streets cleaned em good pretty soon ll chasing overdue library books gordon smiles blake looks stack files like war instinct blake sir night night years ago night dent died confirmed sighting batman murders people takes swat teams breaks dent neck vanishes want know gordon turns look broken searchlight brushes fingers rusted shell jimmy st swithin boys home coach ball wayne foundation gives money brother right like okay sorry tunnels kind work gonna sewers okay miss okay went come gotta gas sewer know sir police commissioner need bruce wayne warrant investigation harvey dent murder count unscheduled commissioner gordon shot chased gunman sewers pulled babbling underground army masked man called bane asked saw giant alligators needs needs batman know care ve met kid orphanage mom died small car accident remember couple years later dad shot gambling debt remember fine lot people know feels like angry bones people understand foster parents understand expect angry kid knows forget stopped understanding sent angry kid boys home st swithin funded wayne foundation figured late hide anger practice smiling mirror like putting mask showed day cool car pretty girl arm excited bruce wayne billionaire orphan stories legends boys stories saw knew seen look face taught blake gets leave wayne lost thought know took fall dent murder believer batman money stopped time fresh air start paying attention details details need help ve got situation way blake points swat vehicles pile blocking vehicle stay foley swat commander allen approach entrance market security chief walks frantic sir armed robbers getting away sure foley looks blake thrusts loudhailer looks like need lift wayne turns blake standing patrol car nods began mask loner family damn good ll figure end yeah ve got pages tunnel records flashlight use help got money john daggett body dumpster hour ago thought like know daggett permits pulled map tunnels gotham blake hands gordon stack files foley glares blake mta maintenance sewer construction coincidence showed picture congressman guess head heels pressing charges blake lays police file thump ve mistakes ms kyle appetite run hide record bane know offer protection selina looks contempt blake shrugs switches tape moves door spotted looking friend bruce wayne selina turns look blake eyes plead kill training exercise ve half daggett cement plants logged locations ve poured underground construction honestly commissioner know civil engineering hey driver turns outside stock exchange right half city cops trying pull castle street truck shut detective detective allowed believe coincidenceswhat commissioner fourteenth street plant dead witnesses lot questions oh god patch foley heading trap trap pull bane pouring concrete laced explosives ring tunnels gonna blow trap cops underground foley looks dread mouth tunnel foley mean sir ll kill second face bane gonna let happen ll dead gonna moving till camerathese men locked blackgate years denied parole dent act based lie betrayed stood hands look pretty filthy commissioner bus case chance evacuate people siphoning parked cars know father boys yes sir mercenaries guarding outflow south ackerman park blow rubble ve got hole big time contact partner waiting day men automatic weapons haven seen daylight months gotham lives warlord like failed state looking vantage point people run corporation owns living captain meet mr fox mr fox like brief captain captain jones indicates miranda important bomb time bomb bane revolution sham watching gotham rearrange deckchairs ship going appeasement plan practical thought captain jones throws blake look addresses fox fox somebody sold fox miranda burst corridor shouldn streetsyou missed spot batman boots head moves blake cares huh know people offense got bigger belt kaabooom bat cannons light night okay need thank chance later knock doors spread word bomb going blow south street tunnel bridge blocks bus boys race street father reilly climbs bus gonna blow need bridge open right orders bane haven heard shooting batman battling baneit detective wait bus boys walk bridge orders date situation changed listen cop like walking shoot blake walks shots ring feet keeps walking idiots sons bitches killing father boys bus come bus protection blast think need hear seconds think going let die hope heads heads children peace explosion downtown gotham blake looks startled turns children bus smallest boys stares window past blake said structures shackles injustice mean going know saved entire city blake john try legal"}}}
