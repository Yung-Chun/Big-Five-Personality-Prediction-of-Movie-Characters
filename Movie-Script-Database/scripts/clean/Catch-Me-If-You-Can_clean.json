Debbie Zane -What's happening to him? Garren and the Guard quickly move toward a sink, where they start to wash their hands. JOE SHAYE What are you doing?Frank, this is Agent Amdursky and Agent Fox. They'll be helping with the extradition. Joe puts the handcuffs on Frank, who can barely stay on his feet as he slowly turns to Warden Garren.You can call him when we get to New York? I apologize for the room -- it's the only place the agency could afford.John Doe 2172 is a paperhanger who started on the East Coast. During the last few weeks 2172 has developed a new form of check fraud, which I'm calling \"the float\". Next slide. The slide doesn't change. JOE SHAYE Next slide, please.The East Coast branches are numbered seven through twelve, the midwest four, five, and six...Yes. And if you change a number one to a number nine -- a check cashed in New York won't be sent to the East Coast Reserve -- but will be re- routed all the way to California. The bank won't know the check has bounced for two weeks, which meansSean, I was hoping to get-some back- up on this.Let me ask you something, Amdursky. if you had so much fun working undercover, why did you transfer into bank fraud?What about you, Mr. Fox? Did you fuck up in the field and get punished?That's just great. I ask for backup, they drag the bottom of the Pacific.Does it bother you, Mr. Fox?Would you guys like to hear me tell a joke?Knock Knock.Go fuck yourselves.Nobody is goin to blame you.

You'd love for me to send twenty agents out on Christmas Eve to barge into that hotel, break down doors so you can make a fool out of me again?Then tell me something. How did you know I wouldn't look in the wallet?The Yankees win because they have Mickey Mantle.You didn't call to apologize, did you John Doe?You've got no one else to call. Joe hangs up the phone. He cups his hands to his face, then stares at a picture of his WIFE AND DAUGHTER -- which sits on the desk in front of him.I'm calling it \"The Switch.\" Next slide. The slide doesn't change. JOE SHAYEThe bank scanners read the micker ink before they read pen ink. So even though those deposit slips are filled out correctly, each person who made a deposit that day was actually putting money into his account.Forty-six thousand, four hundred and' twelve dollars. It was the second largest bank robbery in the history of Las Vegas.The Skywayman. Holy shit, a perfect match.It doesn't make any sense. A thirty- year-old has to register for the draft, which means his prints have to be here.Maybe he's not thirty. Somebody call New York, get a list of juvenile runaways from the NYPD. EXT. - PAULA ABAGNALE'S HOME. `e_ VMIGL ISLAND. - MORNING TEN FBI AGENTS have surrounded a 4 /STORY HOME IN LONG ISLAND. Joe Shaye, wearing a black hat and black overcoat, is knocking on the door with Amdursky and Fox. Paula answers with a cigarette in her hand.Good morning, ma'am, we're the FBI Agents who called.Of course, Ma'am. Do you have a current address for your ex-husband, Frank Abagnale?Ma'am, you filed a police report last year for a juvenile runaway named Frank Ana1e, Jr.What he's doing is a federal offense.So far it's about two million dollars.I just need to go inside and take a quick look around?He's in Atlan Sean! No, I'm not coming back o ashington. I'm going straight to G and I'll meet the team they hit, I'm out of dimes. Sean, w 3, I'm out of dimes! INT. - FRANK'S APARTMENT. - Rc JEND. - NIGHT. Frank and Brenda are lying in bb\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt(c.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdther, staring at each other in the ceiling mirrors.Okay. Kick it in. The Agents kick down the door, and Joe Shaye walks into the office, stares at an electric typewriter that is humming on the desk.Look at that. They show movies on planes now. What's next? Frank and Joe stare at a small MOVIE SCREEN thirty rows in front of them.Yeah. I'm gonna eat it later.No. Joe moves his eclair away from Frank. JOE SHAYE You know what I could never figure out, Frank? How you cheated on the bar exam in Louisiana.Did you have somebody else take the test for you?Director Marsh, Frank Abagnale is no longer forging checks. He's moved on to counterfeiting, making his own Pan Am expense checks from scratch. Next slide. The slide changes. JOE SHAYE The amounts have increased to almost one thousand dollars per check, and the quality, as you can see, is virtually flawless.Sir, with your help I feel an arrest could come at any time. We believe he could be in New Orleans.This is Shaye.I thought you might call. Where are you?What do you want, Doctor Connors?You've stolen four million dollars. t You think we're just gonna call it a wedding present? This isn't something you get to walk away from, Frank.There is no truce. You will be caught, and you will go to prison. Where did you think this was going?I'm close aren't I? You're scared because I'm getting close. How close am I?I can't stop. This is my job.Hello, Brenda. My name is Joe Shaye, and I'm with the FBI.I know this is all a bit scary, but I need you to tell me where Frank is going. A lot of people are looking for him out there, and the last thing we want is for Frank to get hurt. And I swear to you, Brenda, if you tell me where he's going -- I'll keep him safe.We have to stop him before he leaves the country. I want everyone we have inside Miami International. He's used that airport before, he knowsIn the last six months he's gone to Harvard and Berkeley -- I'm betting he can get a passport.This is Shaye.That's the charter terminal. Can you' see his face?Frank, get out of the car! Put your hands on the hood! There's no place to run, so just make it easy on yourself! The car door opens, aMd YEAR-OLD kid gets out of the car, his hands shaking s e(jtares at Joe -- the pilot's cap falling off his head.who are you picking up?Singapore. Australia. South America:' Egypt. He's also hit almost every major bank in Europe.Nobody was called, Sir. The banks didn't know what was happening until last week. We think he's been on the run for five months.He's making real checks, Sir. These are so perfect, Pan Am cashed them all.The last check was cashed in Paris a week ago. He'll stay there another week before he moves on. We have to go now, Sir, today!Paris.English. Do you speak English? I'm an American FBI Agent. Hello? Shit! Joe slams down the phone, walks out'of his office. JOE SHAYE Does anyone here speak French. I need someone who speaks French!Who answered the phone? What's his name.That's fine. Tell him I have a proposition for him. Tell him the FBI has a proposition for him. Oliver translates as Joe paces in front of him.Ask him if he'd like to catch the greatest bank robber the world has ever known.When he gets to a new city he starts out slow, hitting the banks on the outskirts of town. At first it's small checks in small banks that pose little or no threat. WE HEAR OLIVER'S TRANSLATION behind Joe's voice. JOE SHAYE Then he starts moving in, circling the city like a mother hawk, picking off every little bank he can find -- slowly inching his way toward the center of the city.He'll make his move right before lunch, when everyone's mind is on food and the lines are short. And he likes to stand out -- draw attention to himself.The more people see him, the more invisible he becomes.Your father i ead, Frank. I'm sorry. Frank turns to Joe. JOu i He committed su 0\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd.cL didn't want to be the one to tThey found him inside his car, the motor running, the garage door shut.It's okay, Frank.Frank.God in heaven...Merry Christmas, Frank.They say the first year inside is the hardest.I don't know. Maybe this was a bad idea. I'll go. As Joe starts to put the phone down.Yeah. The truth is, I'm divorced- I have a daughter who's nine.This is a counterfeit from Great Lakes Savings and Loan. You can see that he's using a...What?How do you know?Cashmere.Frank, this is FBI Director Marsh. He wanted to meet you.No, Frank. We'd get you out.Mine.That's not possible. Frank opens the drapes and looks out at a POLICE STATION that sits across the street from his apartment.Tomorrow night I'm flying to Chicago to see my daughter. But I'll be back at work on Monday.That's a nice uniform, Frank. Here, let me get your check. Joe grabs the check from Frank, puts some money on the table. JOE SHAYE Did you know I was recruited by the FBI while I was still in law school? The government said I was the best the country had to offer, top of my class -- and they chased me until I said yes.I spent four years arranging your release. I convinced the Attorney General of the United States that you wouldn't run. Frank gets out of his fir, walks out of the restaurant. Joe follows him throw h, irport. JO' : E You go back to E pe r\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdpd you'll die in Papigone. You run here in the states and w 1 d you back to Atlanta for f' ars.Please, Frank, you leave and I'm finished. I got you out, I convinced them to let you out.You're just a kid.I'm gonna let you fly tonight. I won't even try and stop you, because I know you'll be back on Monday.Because nobody is chasing you. Frank stares at Joe for a long BEAT.Which one are you, Frank? Frank turns to the gin? ar the TICKET COUNTER.is Abagnale in yet?Good morning. I've called this emergency briefing to discuss a checkDon't ask. The briefing room door opens, and Frank walks in. Joe spots him in the darkness. JOE SHAYE Good. You're here. The two men stare at each other for a BEAT. JOE SHAYE At this time I'd like my point man on this to fill you in. Frank, are you ready to Ake over?Yeah.It's hot. Let's just hope-we catch this guy fast.No.How much did you say it cost?Where did you get eight hundred dollars?Somebody gave you a credit card? That's a horrifying thought. The two men sit in silence for a BEAT, staring down at their magazines, lost in thought. JOE SHAYE Can I ask you something, Frank?How did you pass the bar exam in Louisiana?Is that the truth? Frank turns to the wipf'or?, slowly starts to smile as he looks out at the clouds. FRANK ABAGNALE JR. HAS BEEN Qf MOR 25 YEARS.

Debbie Zane - 5Is this Ms. Glasser's sixth period French? Some of the students laugh, most just turn back to their friends as Frank nervously adjusts his tie. A GIRL in the front row stares at Frank.Open your books to chapter eight, read quietly to yourselves. The classroom door swings open, and a frail, confused TEACHER walks in and motions to Frank.Yes.I always sub for Roberta.I suggest you start reading people.It's a fake.There's no crease in the paper.When your mom hands you a note to miss school, you put it in your pocket.

Paula wears a dress and holds a tray of food.Dad's at work. Frank stares at Jack, who walks over and picks up his HAT off the chair.Wait.

It's my first week -- I don't think I'm cut out to be a salesman.What's your name?You do me this favor, Ashley, and I'll give you this sterling silver Waldmann pen. It's German. What do you say?

Debbie Zane - 5Happy birthday, Dad. Frank turns to face his son, who is standing in front of a RED CADILLAC that still has the sticker in the window. The two men stare at each other for a long BEAT, and then embrace in the middle of the lot.I bought you a Cadillac. Frank motions to the car, holds up the keys. K ission. She goes s an hour. It btj speedometer. Frank Sr.I went by the store today. Since when do you close on a Friday?I can get you money, whatever you need. We can buy ten stores.Have you talked to Mom?Out of all those soldiers, you were the one that took her home.I was hoping I could buy you a steak.No, I should probably get out to the airport. I'm flying the red eye tonight.Dad, I'm serious about what I said. I can get you money --whatever you need.Yeah. Hawaii.Relax, buddy, you're late. My name is Johnson, Secret Service. Our boy just tried to climb out the window -- my partner has him cuffed in the alley downstairs.You think the FBI are the only ones tracking this guy. We've been following a paper trail for months, almost had him in New York. Would you mind taking that gun out of my face, it makes me nervous.Here. Take my whole wallet. Frank throws his wallet to Joe, who catches it with his free hand, but doesn't open it.You want my gun, too? Come over here and take my gun! Frank opens his jacket, but not wide enough for Joe to see that he's not armed.Counterfeiting is our thing.Don't worry about it. This is his typewriter. I'm gonna go lock it in my trunk. Do me a favor and guard his room for a minute. Frank starts moving toward the back stairwell.And yell down to my partner in the alley -- tell him I'm on my way. Frank starts to walk down back stairwell. He looks back at Joe, who stands at the front of room 212.What's your name, anyway?Tough luck, Joe. Five minutes earlier and you would have landed yourself a pretty good collar. Frank starts walking down the stairs.Hang onto it for a pu`% , I trust you.Do you have any ketchup, Richard?Thanks. Here ya go. Keep the change. Frank takes a crumpled fifty dollar bill out of his pocket, hands it to the waiter.Merry Christmas.Hello, Joe.Johnson, Secret Service. Joe sits up at his desk, grabs a pencil and paper.I've been trying to track you down for a couple of hours. Did you know that most people in the FBI have no idea who you are or what you do?Joe, do you always work on Christmas Eve? Joe looks around the room before he answers.You were wearing a wedding ring in L.A.. I thought maybe you had a family?How come?Okay. I'm at the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan. Suite 3113. Joe starts to write this down, then suddenly stops himself.Joe, I'm sorry if I made a fool out of you.People only know wh r,y` iV tell them.The same reason the Yankees always win. Nobody can keep their eyes off the pinstripes.I have to go. I'm catching a flight in two hours.

Brenda looks up at Frank, her eyes and nose puffy from crying. She covers her mouth when she talks.Brenda, I wouldn't worr-out it. These Doctors don't know everything.No. Nobody will fire you. I'll bet you're good at your job.I'll bet if I asked you to check the status of my friend, Lance Applebaum, you could do that in a second. He hurt his foot tonight. Brenda grabs a chart, starts to read it out loud.See that. No problem. Brenda smiles, covering her mouth.How do you like those braces? Brenda looks embarrassed as she stares at Frank.Mine were bottoms. I h 'e(E hhem. I still have my mouth quaAnd you have a pretty smile. Brenda tries not to smile, shaking her head and covering her face.I'm serious. I think those braces look really good on you.

What does it say?Brenda, do you know if they're hiring here at the h ital?I came to Atlanta to relax, to get away from my practice for a year. But to be honest, I'm a little bored out at River Bend.Would I get to pick my own nurses?Brenda Strong? He smiles at Brenda, who covers her mouth as she smiles back.Doctor Paul Ashland.Yes.

Mine felt so weird after.It feels good, doesn't it?There's a staff Doctor in the emergency ward.Do you really think I have to go?Well, what do we have here?Doctor Hollis, do you concur?What Doctor Ashland just said.So you concur?Brenda, I want to go away with you. I'll take you anywhere you want to go.Just name the place, and we can go. Africa, Egypt, it doesn't matter.Where's Liverpool?Okay. We'll go to Liverpool.Brenda, how would you like to be head nurse at the hospital? isJust think about it, Brenda. You and I could run this hospital one day.It's okay. You don't have to cry.Brenda, it's okay. I don't care about you being a virgin. I can wait.It's okay.What if you were engaged to a doctor, would that change anything? Brenda removes the pillow from her face, stares at Frank.What if I went to your parents, spoke to your father and asked his permission to marry you?I'm not teasing.We can leave right now, never come back.Yes, Sir. I'm a Lutheran.No, Ma'am. This is my first time. And please, call me Frank.Two little mice fell in a bucket of cream. The first mouse gave up and drowned, but the second mouse struggled so hard that he churned that cream into butter -- and he walked out. Amen. They all lift their heads, clearly impressed. Robert turns to Frank and smiles.Who is this?Right. That's very good, Sir.No, Sir. You are an artist.To be honest, I've been thinking about getting back into law.Before I went to medical school I passed the bar in California. I practiced law for a year, then decided to try my hand at pediatrics.Berkeley.You would give me a job?What would I have to do to take the bar here in New Orleans?Are you gonna eat that eclair?Do you want to split it?What's the difference?I'm going to prison for a long time, Joe? What's t)1 difference?I have four letters in my hand that were sent to the defendant's apartment, ea one warning him that his buildin to be sprayed with insecticide, at he should cover his belonging o honor, ladies and gentleman t e jury, this is irrefutable evid e tat the defendant is lyingCase dismissed! Frank shakes Robert's hand, and Robert pulls him close and \"' gives him a hug. Debbie Zane - 5Okay. Reach your hand out and feel that. What do you think it is? Brenda reaches out and touches a DOORKNOB.It's our front door. I made an offer today. Frank removes his hands, and Brenda looks up at the giant, six bedroom house that sits on a cul-de-sac.What do you t)k?We're gonna have it all, Brenda.The same place everyone gets it. The bank.I agreed to speak at this medical conference six months ago. Your father understands. Frank grabs his briefcase and gets out of the car.Next time. I promise.About twenty thousand checks a year.For starters, why don't you show me how you make your checks.Just put it anywhere. They set the camera down, AND WE SLOWLY PULL BACK, see that Frank has turned this office into his own print shop-I make checks for Pan Am. Frank motions out the window, where WE SEE THE PAN AM BUILDING directly across the street.How about a little music, Dad?Dad, I am a lawyer.Has Mom seen you dressed like that?We'll go out together and get you a suit. A new black suit. One of those Manhattan Eagle three button black pearls.Dad, I'm getting married in two weeks- I'm buying a sixty thousand dollar house, a new Cadillac.

Prom is Q u won't let her see you dressed a this.Wait. What are you doing?He left .Okay. Shut it off. The Auto-Pilot flips the switch, and Frank holds on for dear life as he flies the plane into the darkness.Hello, Joe. Merry Christmas. Joe grabs a pad and pencil.I don't know, exactly. An airport somewhere.Joe, I haven't been Doctor Connors for months now.I want to call a trucePlease, leave me alone, Joe. I don't want to do it anymore. Don't make me do it anymore-Will you stop chasing me?It's okay, Joe. I just thought I'd ask.Come with me. Debbie Zane -We have to leave, Brenda. You love me, right? I mean, you would love me no matter what?If I was poor, or sick, or if T' had a different name. A name means n i g, right? My name is Frank Co \u00ef\u00bf\u00bds. That's who I am with you. We al secrets. Sometimes when I tr 1 use the name Frank Williams t r\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd my secret.It means nothing -- Frank Williams, Frank Black -- when I'm with you, I'm Frank Connors -- that's all that matters.Brenda, I don't want to lie anymore. I'm not a doctor. I never went to medical school. Brenda smiles, thinks he's joking.And I'm not a lawyer or a Harvard graduate or a Lutheran. I ran away from home a year and a half ago when I was sixteen.We'll go to Liverpool. We can live there, Brenda, you and I can live wherever we want. I have money, enough for the rest our lives. But you're gonna have ust me. Do you trust me? Do you 1ov, I love you.No matter what. Even ave to live in Liverpool, or I a different name -- you'll still loveBut we'll never tell anyone the truth.

I'm trying to catch a flight.This is Frank Taylor, and I'm letting all the universities in the area know that Pan Am will be initiating a new recruiting program this year. I'll be stopping by your campus tomorrow morning. Debbie Zane - '\u00e2\u0080\u00a2Judy, what does the word \"abroad\" mean to you?Thank you.And what's this, Monica?Very good- And this? The tail. Excellent.Debra Jo McMillian. DEBRA JO comes screaming out from the sea of girls, hugging friends and crying as if she had just won the Ms. America Pageant.Heather Shack. HEATHER SHACK screams and rushes into Debra Jo's arms, the two girls screaming as Frank continues to announce the winners.Excuse me. Do u know where the Lavalier fa lives?Hello. Do you speak English? Monique nods.My name is Frank. My mother is Paula Lavalier. I was hoping to find my family. Monique takes Frank by the hand, starts to smile.It's very good wine. The family starts to laugh at him.What?What's stretching?Everyone says that.My name is Frank Wagner, and I'll be teaching the Summer session of American History, the same course I taught at Yale last year. Why don't you all open your books to chapter one, read quietly to yourselves.What is this place?I thought the family business was wine?I've read books about these machines. But I've never seen one.Yes.I don't know.Let's go for a drive. I need some supplies. The limo drives off. Debbie Zane - 5Joe, you have to let me call my father when we land- I want to talk to him before he sees me on television.Suicide. No. That's imps 'iblwho are they to think that? Who are they to say something like that?!Joe, I'm gonna be sick! I have to use the bathroom. Joe quickly takes off Frank's handcuffs, and he jumps from his seat and runs into the bathroom. Joe stands in the aisle with Amdursky and Fox. Debbie Zane - 5Why didn't you help him?Then why did you marry him?What about the baby?You promised. He doesn't look back at her as he walks out the door.I don't smoke. An awkward moment as Joe puts the cigarettes on the floor.You caught me. What do you want?You're still wearing a wedding ring.What's her name?Do you have any of the checks?It's a teller at the bank.It's a teller.Every bank uses hand stamps for the dates. They get used over and over, so they're always worn down, and the numbers are always cracking -- the sixes and nines go first. Look at the date on that check -- the ink is worn flat, the nines and sixes are cracking -- that's the stamp of a teller, Joe. Looks like you got yourself an inside job.Eastern flight 794 you are clear to taxi on runway_two-zero-four. That's a big thank y, and goodbye, Newark. Ladies and eman, we are leveled off here at't five thousand feet. The sm gns have been turned off for of you in a designated smoki My name is Captain Frank Will so just sit back, relax, an the flight to Milan.Joe, one of these days you should get yourself a new jacket. What is that material? Frank touches Joe's jacket.That isn't cashmere -- look at the lining. It's some kind of polyester. You should see my tailor in New York.At four in the morning? 1 1It's a fake.There's no perforated edge, which means this check was hand cut, not fed. The paper is double bonded, much too heavy for a check. The ink is raised against my fingers instead of flat. Frank brings the check to his nose, sniffs it.I already have a job here. I deliver the mail.Why are you saying this, Joe? You caught me, isn't that enough? Why can't you lea ' me alone?Whose custody?I'm Frank Abagnale. I'm supposed to start work here today.Call me Frank.Morning, Joe. Frank turns and stares at a door marked FRAUD. He casually walks inside.I'd rather stay in a hotel.One of the men gave me a check today. It was for nine dollars.Tomorrow's Christmas Eve. Would it be okay if I went to work with you?Joe. . .what do I do until Monday?I'm sorry, Joe.I never asked for your help.Why did you do it?I'm not your kid. I'm not your son. I'm nothing to you. And you're nothing to me. Frank walks toward the AMERICAN AIRLINES ticket counter.Why would I come back?Two mice fell in a bucket of cream. The first mouse gave up and drowned, but the second mouse struggled so hard he churned that cream into butter and he crawled out.Joe, do you guys always fly coach?You want me to talk to someone? See if I can get us bumped to first class?Joe, you ever seen the Grand Canyon?It looks good.

The first mouse quickly gave up and drowned, but the second mouse wouldn't quit. He struggled so hard,Paula, show him the dance you were doing when we met.The people in that little French Village were so happy to see Americans, that they decided to put on a show for us.So they cram two hundred soldiers into this tiny social hall, and the first person to walk on stage is your mother. And she starts to dance... Paula steps away from Frank, and she starts to dance a ballet, smiling as she tries to remember the steps. FRANK SR. It had been months since we had even seen a woman, and here's this blonde angel on stage -- and the men are literally holding their breath. And I turned to my buddies, and I said..Wake up, Frank... it's eight-thirty. Frank opens his eyes, stares at his father.It's okay. You don't have to go to school today.Do you own a black suit?We have a vermportant meeting in the city.Ma'am, open the door. Just open up, please, it's important. THE DOOR OPENS A CRACK AND DARCY, 40's, low cut blouse, a bagel in her hand, stares at Frank Sr.What's your name, ma'am?Darcy, that's a pretty name. I'm in a bit of fix -- I need a suit for my kid. This is my son, Frank, he needsIs this yours, Darcy? I just found it in the parking lot? Darcy stares at the necklace through the door.Slide over. You're gonna take me to Chase Manhattan Bank. Just head up to seventy-second and Madison, pull up to the front and park next to the fire hydrant. Frank looks back at his father.A little more gas -- now slip it into second. That's good, more clutch, now pull into this lane here -- slowly!Okay. Stop grinning. When I get inside you go back to the front seat and wait. Even if a cop comes and writes you a ticket, you don't move the car, understood?You know why the Yankees always win, Frank?No. It's because the other teams can't stop staring at those damn pinstripes. Frank Sr. steps out from the Cadillac, grabs his briefcase. FRANK SR. Watch this, Frank. The manager of Chase Manhattan bank is about to open the door for your father. As Frank Sr. casually walks toward the doors of Chase Manhattan, the MANAGER rushes through the bank to open the doors for him.That's just a misunderstanding. I hired the wrong guy to do my books, a mistake anyone could make. I wouldn't even consider that if I were you.My store is a landmark in New Rochelle. I have customers all over New Jersey.My bank went out of business. Banks like this put them out of business. Frank Sr. leans in, lowers his voice. FRANK SR. Now I know I made a mistake, I admit that. But these people want blood -- they want my store -- they've threatened to put me in jail. This is America, right, I'm not a criminal. I'm a medal of honor winner, a lifetime member of the New Rochelle Rotary Club. All I'm asking you to do is help me beat these guys.Come on, Frank. Let's go return the suit.

I have to go to work.You're not suspending anyone. if you go after my son I'll go before the school board and ask them who's minding the ste at Monroe High.

Frank Sr. hands Frank a letter.We're gonna move back here, Frank, get a new house, a new car --It's gonna take a little time, but we're gonna get it all back --every fur coat, eve goddamn piece of silver!

He's twenty-two and he's making five bills a week, so just bring the drinks and mind your business. Frank and his father sit at a small table in the middle of the bar. Frank looks uncomfortable as his father lights a cigar.Are you afraid of these men? Look at the way, they sit, the way they dress, the way they drink. What are they, railway men? Cargo loaders? Those men haven't earned the right to judge us. I beat Uncle Sam, what have they ever done? The WAITRESS brings o the drinks, and Frank Sr. quickly downs both shots.

You got a problem, come bother me. Frank watches as TWO DRUNKS walk toward his father. They both hold PITCHERS OF BEER in their hands. FRANK SR. Hit the button, Frank. You hit that goddamn button!You guys are looking for the wrong person.if I tell you where he is, will you promise not to tell his mother? The two Detectives nod. FRANK SR. Frank made up a fake I.D and enlisted in the Marine Corps -- he's over inIt's okay. Nobody knows.Jesus, look at you? My son the birdman. That is some uniform, Frank.I had to close the store for awhile. It's all about timing, Frank, the goddamn government knows that. They hit you when you're down, and I wasn't gonna let them take it from me. So I just shut the doors myself, called their bluff.No. It's better this way. I'm laying' low for awhile, letting them have their fun. It's just a stationery store -- sooner or later they'll forget about me.She's so stubborn, your mother.
