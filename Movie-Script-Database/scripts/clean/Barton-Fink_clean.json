{"Barton-Fink": {"BARTON": {"raw_line": "Not yet.Thanks, Richard, but I know for a fact the only fish you've ever seen were tacked to a the wall of the yacht club.Please Derek \u0096They'll be wrapping fish in it in the morning so I guess it's not a total waste.Don't get me wrong \u0096 I'm glad it'll do well for you, Derek.All right, but I can't start listening to the critics, and I can't kid myself about my own work. A writer writes from his gut, and his gut tells him what's good and what's... merely adequate.I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people.The play was marvelous. She wept, copiously. Millions of dollars and no sense.To do what?I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.To see pap.I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-No, Garland, don't you see? Not the kind of success where the critics fawn over you or the producers like Derek make a lot of money. No, a real success \u0096 the success we've been dreaming about \u0096 the creation of a new, living theater of, about, and for the common man! If I ran off to Hollywood now I'd be making money, going to parties, meeting the big shots, sure, but I'd be cutting myself off from the wellspring of that success, from the common man....I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.No, what did it say?...That's a rationalization, Garland.I'm checking in. Barton Fink.Must be.Excuse me?I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?Huh?What \u0096...What number is it?The others are being sent....Six, please....Who is this?...Who?It's not as bad as it looks; just a mosquito in my room \u0096I'm at the Earle.Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik \u0096...Yes, thank you....Both maybe?Hello... Chet? This is Barton Fink in room 605. Yes, there's uh, there's someone in the room next door to mine, 604, and he's uh... He's uh... making a lot of... noise....Thank you.No, I didn't \u0096 I mean, I did call down, not to complain exactly, I was just concerned that you might \u0096 not that it's my business, but that you might be in some kind of... distress. You see, I was trying to work, and it's, well, it was difficult \u0096Barton Fink.That's all right, really, thank you.Okay... a quick one, sure...That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work \u0096Well, I'm a writer, actually.Can be. Not easy, but \u0096And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?Doesn't surprise me at all.Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now \u0096That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies \u0096 though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.What do I write about?Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York \u0096 hopefully our numbers are growing \u0096 who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths \u0096 not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did......I don't guess this means much to you.And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life \u0096 why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater? Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there? Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and \u0096 and \u0096 and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying \u0096 a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!Sure you could! And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man \u0096 from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and \u0096 and \u0096 and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and \u0096 well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.Frequently played, seldom remarked.You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if \u0096 well I know I sometimes run on.Well, we've got something in common then.Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.See you, Charlie.He looks around to the opposite \u0096 bed \u0096 wall.I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the \u0096...Huh? No, I'm \u0096I'm a writer. Ted O \u0096I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.Then who should I talk to?But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected \u0096Who?Barton Fink....Jesus. W.P.!W.P. Mayhew? The writer?Bill!......You're the finest novelist of our time.Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.It's still a little early for me....Bill, if I'm imposing you should say so, I know you're very busy \u0096 I just, uh... I just wonder if I could ask you a favor... That is to say, uh... have you ever written a wrestling picture?I'm sorry, I... My name is Fink... Uh, Bill asked me to drop by this afternoon. Is he in?Is, uh... Is he okay?How about you? Will you be alright?Yes I am. I'm working on a wres \u0096 please call me Barton.Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. \u0096I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.Please, Barton.I see.No, no \u0096Charlie. How are you.Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet \u0096 what happened to your ear?Seen a doctor?No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.Nope.No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie? I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but...You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie. Your daily routine \u0096 you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory......and exploring it can be painful. The kind of pain most people don't know anything about....This must be boring you.Yeah......Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself \u0096That's all right, really \u0096...Yeah, okay.It's okay, it's okay.I'm fine, Charlie. Really I am. Actually, it's been helpful, but I guess I should get back to work.Well... actually, no Bill......No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man \u0096 to help somehow to ease his suffering. Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.That's true, Bill. I've never found it to help my writing.Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent \u0096 don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.What's that?You're lucky she puts up with as much as she does.That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.Are you all right?Audrey, you can't put up with this.What?! He's a son of a bitch!Really?......Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.Okay, but that doesn't excuse his \u0096What. What don't I understand?Hi, Charlie.Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.Seems like nothing but, lately.Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started \u0096 I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me \u0096 my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer. Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.How did you know about that?Yeah, but \u0096Where there's life there's hope.And there's hope for you too, Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen policies.You're leaving?I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.New York can be pretty cruel to strangers, Charlie. If you need a home-cooked meal you just look up Morris and Lillian Fink. They live on Fulton Street with my uncle Dave.I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.Well...What do you mean?Well, I guess you pick your poison.Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.Well I...Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started\u0096Well not much.I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-He's a great writer \u0096You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-But... I thought no one cared about this picture.I don't understand-I didn't say anything-I can't write anything by tomorrow.Well what do I tell him?Hello, Chet, it's Barton Fink in 605. Can you try a number for me in Hollywood... Slausen 6-4304.Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this \u0096 believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I \u0096 I'm sorry - listen, how are you \u0096 I'm sorry. You doing okay?Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.I'm sorry, I just feel like \u0096I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-If you could, I'd \u0096I need help, Audrey.Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you. I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?Well I have to come up with \u0096 an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-No, but the whole goddamn \u0096 Audrey? Have you ever had to read any of Bill's wrestling scenarios?What are they like? What are they about?Did what for Bill?You wrote his scripts for him?You wrote Bill's scripts! Jesus Christ, you wrote his \u0096 what about before that?Before Bill came to Hollywood.What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!I want to know!Hah!I'll bet. Jesus \u0096 \"The grand productive days.\" What a goddamn phony....W.P. Mayhew. William Goddamn Phony Mayhew. All his guff about escape. Hah! I'LL say he escaped!...Well, we don't have much time.No!... I'm fine. Thank you.No... no...No... Can I come in?Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.Charlie, I'm in trouble \u0096 something horrible's happened \u0096 I've gotta call the police......Will you stay with me till they get here?Before you go in \u0096 I didn't do this. I don't know how it happened, but I didn't... I want you to know that...I've gotta call the police \u0096 or you could call for me \u0096You gotta believe me \u0096I didn't do this, I did NOT do this\u0096I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!We gotta call the police \u0096Yeah.I don't know! Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know. Won't the police be able to \u0096But I didn't do it \u0096 don't you believe me?They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?Yeah... rye whiskey?Yeah, okay... well... we fade in......It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...And then... well......Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?Well... to be honest, I'm never really comfortable discussing a work in progress. I've got it all worked out in my head, but sometimes if you force it out in words \u0096 prematurely \u0096 the wrong words \u0096 well, your meaning changes, and it changes your own mind, and you never get it back \u0096 so I'd just as soon not talk about it.Mr. Lipnik, that's not really necessar-I \u0096 Mr. Lipnik \u0096Mr. Lipnik, I \u0096No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help \u0096Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider \u0096Jesus... You're leaving.Jesus, Charlie, I...Charlie! I've got no one else here! You're the only person I know in Los Angeles......that I can talk to.Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy \u0096 like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just......I just don't know what... to do\u0096Yeah, but Charlie \u0096Sure, Charlie.It's more than I've got.Thanks, Charlie.You'll be back?Hello... Chet... Who?...... No, don't send them up here. I'll be right down....You read the Bible, Pete?Yeah.Yeah.Uh-huh.I write.Well as a matter of fact, I write for the pictures.No, I \u0096 I didn't mean to sound \u0096I \u0096 I've got respect for \u0096 for working guys, like you \u0096Yeah.A week, eight, nine days \u0096Nine days \u0096 Tuesday \u0096...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me....Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.What did... What did he \u0096I......No. I never saw him with anyone else.Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business.Well that's what he said.He... I'm trying to think... Nothing, really... He... He said he liked Jack Oakie pictures.Yeah.Hello? Operator! I can't... Oh!Garland, it's me.Yeah, I'm fine, Garland \u0096 I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.Not big in the sense of large \u0096 although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.Have you read the Bible, Garland?Yes... Isn't it?Sound a little what?Thanks, Garland. Thanks for all the encouragement....Nitwit.This is MY dance, sailor!I'm a writer! Celebrating the completion of something GOOD! Do you understand that, sailor? I'm a WRITER!I'm a writer, you monsters! I CREATE! He points at his head....This is my uniform!...THIS is how I serve the common man! THIS is where I \u0096Keep your filthy eyes off that.Charlie...

work and me carrying on in there. Look, the liquor's good, wuddya say?... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.Damned difficult, I'd imagine.Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game \u0096 door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise....In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people \u0096 that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need \u0096 a fella could do worse.What kind of scribbler are you \u0096 newspaperman did you say?Pictures! Jesus!...I'm sorry, brother, I was just sitting here thinking I was talking to some ambitious youngster, eager to make good. Hell, you've got it made! Writing for pictures! Beating out that competition! And me being patronizing!...Is the egg showing or what?!Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm not the best-read mug on the planet, so I guess it's no surprise I didn't recognize your name. Jesus, I feel like a heel.Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.Well ain't that a kick in the head!Hell, I could tell you some stories\u0096I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.I can feel my butt getting sore already.And I could tell you some stories \u0096Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.Whatever that means.Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.Well Christ, if there's any way I can contribute, or help, or whatever\u0096Well, I can tell you some stories \u0096...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.Howdy, neighbor.Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here. Figured I'd drop by.Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing. Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me? Can't trade my head in for a new one.Thanks, I'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess. You married, Bart?I myself have yet to be lassoed....Got a sweetheart?Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention. In my experience, they pretend to give it, but it's generally a smoke- screen for demanding it back \u0096 with interest. How about family, Bart? How're you fixed in that department?Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now......What's the expression \u0096 me myself and I.Mm... You're no stranger to loneliness, then. I guess I got no beef; especially where the dames are concerned. In my line of work I get opportunities galore \u0096 always on the wing, you know what I'm saying. I could tell stories to curl your hair \u0096 but it looks like you've already heard 'em!...That's me in Kansas City, plying my trade....It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton. They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time \u0096Not at all. It's damned interesting.Beery! You got no beef there! He's good. Hell of an actor \u0096 though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong \u0096 Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds....You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration \u0096Not a bit of it, compadre! Easiest thing in the world! You just get down on your knees to my left, slap your right hand here......and your left hand here....You can do it, champ!...All right now, when I say \"Ready... wrestle!\" you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?Ready... wrestle!Damn, there I go again. We're gonna wake the downstairs neighbors. I didn't hurt ya, did I?Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class....Jesus, I did hurt you!...I'm just a big, clumsy lug. I sure do apologize....You sure you're okay?Well, it wasn't fair of me to do that. I'm pretty well endowed physically....Don't feel bad, though. I wouldn't be much of a match for you at mental gymnastics. Gimme a holler if you need anything.I hope these are your shoes.Because that would mean they gave you mine.Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...A little lift, yeah......Good thing they bottle it, huh pal?...Did I say rude? People can be goddamn cruel. Especially some of their housewives. Okay, so I've got a weight problem. That's my cross to bear. I dunno...Defense against what? Insurance? Something they need? Something they should be thanking me for offering? A little peace of mind?......Finally decided to knock off early, take your advice. Went to see a doctor about this....He told me it was an ear infection. Ten dollars, please. I said, hell, I told YOU my ear was infected. Why don't YOU give ME ten dollars? Well, THAT led to an argument......Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?Those two love-birds next door drivin' you nuts?Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours....Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. You've got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say? Where there's a head, there's a hope?That proves you really are a writer!Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact \u0096 New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face! This is still home for me \u0096 I keep my room, and I'll be back sooner or later......And \u0096 mark my words \u0096 by the time I get back you're picture'll be finished. I know it.Christ!...Your room does that too?What a dump......I guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you.Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.This kind of heat. It's pathetic.So they say.Course not, compadre. You'll see me again.Are you all right?...Can I come in?Are you sure \u0096Barton. Are you all right?Why don't we go to your room-Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-Okay.Jesus... Jesus... Jesus have mercy......Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this? What're we gonna do?Hold on \u0096Hold on \u0096Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.What do you think happened?Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!I believe you \u0096 I KNOW you. But why should the police?...Did you... Barton, between you and me, did you have sexual intercourse?Jesus... They can tell that...You're in pictures, Barton. Even if you got cleared eventually, this would ruin you....Wait in the bathroom.You passed out.She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.Barton, listen to me. You gotta act like nothing's happened. Put this totally out of your head. I know that's hard, but your play from here on out is just to go about business as usual. Give us some time to sort this out......Just put it out of you head...Barton. Can I come in?Have to, old timer. Just for a while.Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.It's okay... It's okay...You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on \u0096 just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you \u0096 well I do. Now don't argue with me....Look, pal \u0096 can you do something for me?...Keep this for me, till I get back....It's just personal stuff. I don't wanna drag it with me, but I don't trust 'em downstairs, and I'd like to think it's in good hands.Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime \u0096 when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me......Make me your wrestler. Then you'll lick that story of yours.Yeah, well, see you soon, friend. You're gonna be fine.Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.LOOK UPON ME! LOOK UPON ME! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE OF THE MIND!!LOOK UPON ME! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE OF THE MIND! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE OF THE MIND!Heil Hitler.Barton!...Brother, is it hot.How you been, buddy?...Don't look at me like that, neighbor. It's just me \u0096 Charlie.Jesus, people can be cruel......if it's not my build, it's my personality....They say I'm a madman, Barton, but I'm not mad at anyone. Honest I'm not. Most guys I just feel sorry for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to think about what they're going through. How trapped they are. I understand it. I feel for 'em. So I try and help them out......Jesus. Yeah. I know what it feels like, when things get all balled up at the head office. It puts you through hell, Barton. So I help people out. I just wish someone would do as much for me......Jesus it's hot. Sometimes it gets so hot, I wanna crawl right out of my skin.Because you DON'T LISTEN!...Jesus, I'm dripping again....C'mon Barton, you think you know about pain? You think I made your life hell? Take a look around this dump. You're just a tourist with a typewriter, Barton. I live here. Don't you understand that......And you come into MY home... And you complain that I'M making too... much... noise.Don't be.I'm getting off the merry-go-round....I'll be next door if you need me....Oh, I dropped in on your folks. And Uncle Dave?...Good people.
