The limousine drives onto the ferry.Guns have appeared in the hands of the Puerto Ricans and they start to blast at the limousine from outside. The ferry whistle is blowing.One of the Puerto Rican kids is hit squarely in the chest.

McKissick is lighting Elizabeth's cigarette as Tony comes up with the two drinks.Finally.On temporary assignment.You'll be astonished.Shh.I don't know.S've got a. gun at your partner's head.

Elizabeth nods and half-stumbles out of the room. Tony crosses to the Man.No, I'm not. Tony lifts the gun and blasts the First Man three times in the chest.It's all right.. He tried to get my gum away and I had to shoot him. As. Tony, still comforting her, moves her away, We --I'm pleased to meet you, Doctor. They shake hands, then:.Are you read-!?Yes. ,we got you BARS and Carbines plus ten, thirty calibre light machine guns, and ten, four-point t o inch mortars with a thousand rounds of high explosive and a thousand, rounds of white phosphorous.

They're lightweight, one-shot dis- posable Bazookas.You, go in tomorrow to get it ready. I'll meet you down there at the end of the week.I'll show you the set up.
