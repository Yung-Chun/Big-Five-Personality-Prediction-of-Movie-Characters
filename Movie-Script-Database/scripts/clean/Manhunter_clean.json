He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces. None of them knew that;Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?Why not?And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.Last two like this we had, you caught.That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.You look all right now.If you can't look anymore, I understand...These are all dead, Will.I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collectI have to.Because it's his bad luck to be special.Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?He's working on the single print index. What time is it?You said the guy down here is good.What do you want to do?A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat. Neighbors are watching for it.Can you make an identification off it?Lounds, give it a rest...Get the hell away from here, Lounds! CUT TO: INT. DINER, BOOTH - GRAHAM + CRAWFORD - DAY Graham is staring into the black deep recesses of his coffee. Crawford is looking at him. Finally:I know...Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print. ..What's one way?We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack. What's the other?No other possibilities?Why?See? You do know something about him.For Christ's sake, why?Is it weird?If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...... bur if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?Will. Get right back here. He just called.Thanks, no.... very little. If it's all electronic switching we'll need a minute for the trace.Where the hell's Graham!For Christ's sake get him!How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop? Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!Run along to the police station, Freddie. We'll talk to you when we get around to it...Have your building superintendent shut off the water and most of the lighting in Lecktor's hall. Have him walk through carrying tools and being pissed off or something,Brian. We have a note coming in on the fly. Possibly from the Tooth Fairy. Number one priority., It has to go to Hair and Fiber, Latent Prints and Documents. Graham and I will be walking it through...Twenty minutes max.That could be the tip of a 't. Here and here. And here.The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.After we find Lecktor's response, we substitute our own. Somewhere tomorrow night the Tooth Fairy will actually buy Tattler, looking for Lecktor's message. Here's what he'll find, Bill.It's a Secret Service letter drop and stakeout. He shows: we take him. Anything from Chicago?Let's get to the physical.Issue the toilet paper tear as a...... twenty-eight minutes. Cryptography at Langley?Book code?Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place...Where?We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.It's your call, Will. What do we do?What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all. It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.Wait, Will...I'll pick you up in...I need to talk to you about Will Graham.I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.That was Peterson upstairs.He doesn't think you run mind games on him.You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on- one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?Why aren't you ever alone with him?His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?That's when it happened?What's the bottom line?Could he handle a direct contact?Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah-jongg piece. It means Red Dragon. That mean anything to you?You okay?You got the message Lecktor called...From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, Sr. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.When are you coming back?What's important?'Changes?'VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?There's no connection between the families.There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times .What?Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it. You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh. ..It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM. The full moon is tonight.Will?What's that?Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.He had to.It's getting late and...It's the guard in the storeroom.There's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows.He found them...Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field. At Meigs have them warn up and flight-prep the Gulf Stream.This is Jack Crawford, FBI. Who am I speaking to?All we know is this man owns a van and he works at Gateway. We have physical characteristics...Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van.Start feeding me names.Next ...Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...is staring at Graham's blankness.WillYou're not going to need that. Because we're going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a St. Louis PD Swat team is going to take him. Not us.Get the roadblocks set on Route Three!

Why didn't he care that he left AB saliva on the glass? it was hot out that night. inside, the house must' have been pleasantly cool to him. The intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat as he lay asleep beside Mrs. Leeds. He shot Mrs. Leeds as she was rising... Bullet entered the right of her navel and lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation... increase of serotonin and free histimine levels in the gunshot wound indicates... she lived at least five minutes after she was shot... All her other injuries were post-mortem. (beat> Then he went toward the children's room. Direction and velocity of blood stains on the east wall indicate arterial spray.;. With his throat cut, Mr. Leeds still tried to fight. Because the intruder was moving to the children's room... in the children's room the intruder shot the first boy in bed. Second boy was found in bed, but dustballs indicate he was dragged out from under his bed to be shot...Profusion of bloodstains and matted sliding marks on hall carpet and west wall of master bedroom remain unexplained... as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leed's chest, believed to be post-mortem. What did the killer do with them after they were dead? And before he put the boys back in their beds?There's a wicker dog bed on the back porch. There's a doghouse in the back yard. Where's the dog?When they were dead -- except possibly Mrs. Leeds -- he smashed the mirrors and began selecting shards that he used later on Mrs. Leeds... What did he do in the interval? Struggling with Mr. Leeds and killing the others would take less than a minute. What else? Three bloodstains on the east wall, not from Mr. Leed's arterial spray. What did killer do after they were dead?Molly?It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep. I love you...You moved the kids after you killed them, didn't you? Did you arrange them for your performance with Mrs. Leeds on their bed? Did you tie Mr. Leeds sitting up in bed? That's the postmortem ligature on his chest. Did you make them your audience? Did you open their eyes? There is something you can't afford for me to know about. Isn't there? Mrs. Leeds was lovely, wasn't she? It was maddening to have to wear gloves when you touched her, wasn't it? There was talcum powder on her leg. There was no talcum powder in the bathroom. The powder they found came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it offJack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?He is good. Bur not as good as Price.Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack. And dust all the corneas of all their eyes.The report didn't mention nails and eyes.Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy. Everybody else was dead.He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.That's all we know about.Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior. You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin... He bites a lot.Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.I call him a monster.(cold right turn> What about the dog?Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard... maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.Keep the fuck away from me!...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures.

Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever... If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?' That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack....

Thank you.Stuart is fine.No.Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.Very interesting, even to a layman.You've read the transcript. It's all there.It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.You read about it, I'm sure.I thought you would have some ideas.There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.No. I knew that I'm nor smarter than you are.You had disadvantages.You're insane.I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...Yes.Yes.No.Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.sits in the chair. He wants a cigarette. He doesn't take one. He waits. And he watches. What he sees:Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?That's interesting.Yes. I'd considered it.I want your opinion.When you do have one I'd like to hear it.I haven't decided yet.No.Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.Block her off, Mitch...Have any single men asked to look at it?Uh-uh.... after you killed the cat and threw it into the yard, my man, you climbed up hero and waited. You used a cutting tool on these branches so you could see.You watched the children and passed the time whittling and dreaming. When night came, you saw them passing their bright windows and you watched the shades go down, and you saw the lights go out one by one. And after a while, you climbed down and you went in to them, didn't you? DIDN'T YOU, YOU SON OF A BITCH! YOU WATCHED THEM ALL GODDAMN DAY LONG! ! That's why you like houses with big yards, the easier to see themI'm sending the can to Jimmie Price to dust for prints. I need Bowman in Documents to fall on this carving. Then I need the Firearms and Toolmarks Section out here on the severed branch. I need to know what kind of cutting tool he used.The mark? Yes.Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?Who did he ask for?...so how do I play him, Sidney?This is Will Graham. Can I help you?I don't understand.Do you know something about that?I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things .Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?Let's get straight who we've talking about. Are you the man I'm interested in?He's right-handed.He's misunderstood.He's very strong physically.He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.I don't want to do that,You tell me. You have a man in custody?Yeah. I'm preferring charges! Obstruction of justice. You lock that asshole up. You hold him for the U.S. Attorney! You...What is it?Where did you get it?!Can you read it to me?After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it. Where's Lector now?How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?Hair from Lecktor's comb. Whiskers from an electric razor they let him use. This is hair from the cleaning man.Ninhydran? Boosted with heat?The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.He doesn't have anything to cut with.We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...Personal ads?In thirty-five minutes.Bowman?Will Graham, Jack Crawford...Read it.That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student. He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor...Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon .Run it.We will feel sick for a very long time.Who is it?What'd it say?Tell me now.Get me a plane...Get me a plane!I won't be here....sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you.It's a precaution... Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?' He read the Tattler piece, didn't he?Good for him. Thanks a lot, Freddie! Kevin. We're going grocery shopping .No. You're very well-protected. No one can find our where you are.We don't know that.No. It's just my job to find him. I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.With a knife.I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was.., peculiar. I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying. I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait .Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.I kept thinking there must be some way I could have handled it better. It kept replaying in my mind. Later I got depressed. A doctor friend of mine, Dr. Bloom, asked me to go into a hospital. After a while I got some distance on it and was okay.No....after a while.Kevin: it's the ugliest thing in the world.Huh?Slick as hell.I remember.Yes. I said this is too good to live...You don't recommend what, Sidney?If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.That's what you were thinking, isn't it?Sidney, he doesn't read the \"Sunday Times literary supplement. He reads Lounds in the \"Tattler.\" And I want this over with... Fast.I believe he's socially maladjusted. Laughed at by his contemporaries...He's not as intelligent.What have we missed?The killer has sexually molested all his male victims. He is a homosexual and impotent with persons of the opposite sex. Our forensic psychologists have projected he may have been the product of an incestuous home life . And probably had sexual relations with his mother...All right. Let's shoot the pictures .Keep the motel sign across the street just slightly out of focus. He has to be able to read it, but it can't look too obvious.No.Pretty well.Glaser Safety Slugs?Kevlar Second Chance.Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'Let's walk the route.God-dammit!!!You haven't smoked in two years.No.I wanted it over fast. It felt dirty to not tell you.No.Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.I have to go back to Birmingham.No. I have to be. in there... alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while. I'll come and get you afterwards...Molly. I love you. And I'm not really going to be fit to be with for awhile...And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper? In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home? This ends when I make it over.Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana. Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...!I'm sorry, too...Coffee ...It's just YOU and me now, sport. And I'd better hurry up and find you. Because I'm losing all this...I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.What's it narrow down to?That's narrow?When I'm done.It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?Sure he is. Blond. Probably Scandinavian, too...Yes. Is Molly there?I know... 'Out in the good air...'Tell her I called.What do you want?I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.Fight what?I don't believe in God.Why does it feel good?I enter. The glass cutter. I lick the suction cup. The piece of glass I take out is mine. House is mine . I walk up these stairs. I pass childrens' toys. The children mean nothing to me...I am soundless. I move to the door. I step into the room...You will be better than anything... anything I have ever known. As I see me in your eyes.., as I see me accepted there. Reflected there in mirrors . And you, you are the fuel for my changing... as this event becomes one more step towards what I am becoming that is different than what I have ever been before... As I see me, accepted by you, in the silver mirrors of your eyes...He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors. I didn't understand the mirrors before. It's very important.It's a word. Killing them... His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time. And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...How do I know?!He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses, If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.There has to be.He's a very shy boy...Something Lecktor said.It's not over yet.You wanna watch this or what?!That's why the boltcutter.He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?Donald Jacobi's eleventh birthday party was April fourteenth. Sometime between April fourteenth and May third they changed the door. But you can't see either family's door from the street. He wouldn't know until he got to the house that the padlock wasn't there anymore...From the alley he couldn't have seen the glass in the Leeds' kitchen door .There's a lattice porch back there, but he was ready with his glasscutter. So he was either casing far ahead and we didn't check back far enough or...Don't talk to me!!It's Graham. The Jacobi stuff is still in the storeroom?Have one of the guards down there call me.Do it.You knew that was the Jacobis' cat ...You brought a boltcutter... 'cause you thought there was a padlock...And the Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar... But you know it's the Leeds' dog, don't you, my man?!See the woman?The bloom on the woman. You can almost feel her. You can see her again and again. Anytime you want. The doggy doesn't have a collar. But you know the Leeds' dog, don't you? And you know the Jacobi cat. And the padlock on the door and you know you need a boltcutter and every other goddamn thing 'cause... YOU'VE SEEN THESE FUCKING FILMS! Haven't you, my man?We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in. They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.Have him peel the top label back.It does, doesn't it?Parking permits...Run these names to your DMV for a driver's license check.

You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...All the things that happened to you before make you know that...What you've already decided. You're not really asking.Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me. And Kevin. That's selfish, huh?Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?He thinks you want him to look at evidence.You wouldn't like it, either if you had it.No. I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...Huh? Will? Is that you?Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will. Good night.Hello, hotshot!At the store. You doin' some good?Me, too. And very erotic...Which part? That or the day-to-day.Kevin's fine.

I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.To do what?I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?Yellow's a bad color for me. I'LL look green at breakfast.Blue is cold.Will, I don't know why I'm talking about this stuff... I called to tell you: I love you and I miss you. And you are doing the right thing. It's costing you, too. And I know that. And I'm here. I'LL be here whenever you come home. Or I'LL meet you anywhere. Anytime.

My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.And?A layman.., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'No it's not. Do you know how you Did it Will?It doesn't matter to me, Will.Yes, I thought so.Yes .In the papers. I don't rear out the articles. I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid.

Then I'll tell you what I think.There is a very shy boy, Will.What were the yards like?Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it. Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?I don't have one right now.May I keep the file?I'll study it, Will.

Would you like to give me your home number?Do you know how you caught me, Will?Do you know how you caught me?The reason you caught me, Will, is: we're just alike. You want the scent? Smell yourself.Thank you so much. I'll call you when I'm finished.Can I have the number of Dr. Sidney Bloom, University of Chicago, Department of Psychiatry, please? Thank you. Dr. Sidney Bloom, please.What's his secretary's name again...?Hi, Linda. ..Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes.

Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good? And why shouldn't it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time!You should, Will. God's terrific! He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were grovelling to Him and singing a hymn. Don't you think that felt good?
