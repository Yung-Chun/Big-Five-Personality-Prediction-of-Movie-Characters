{"Roughshod": {"MARY": {"raw_line": "Until you came along we were going to Sonora.Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people. Can I make it?Thank you, Mr. Graham.Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.Goodbye and thanks.No. We came down the hill a little fast and... ...the wheel broke. Can you fix it for us?Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.And this is Helen Carter.I was at first. Then I was hanging on. Are you going far?As far as -- Sonora?We're going to Sonora, too, so that solves everything.We can ride in your wagon.We wouldn't think of asking you to take us for nothing.There's only four of us.They won't be riding in the wagon.You can't leave us here.What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.Our kind of women?Maybe in Sonora.Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?Now where's she goin'? --Who's the old folks?It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.And this is Helen Carter.Come on, Honeybunch. We're changing trains.A nice, kind wrangler is letting us ride in his wagon......as far as the first ranch. From then on --What's the difference?There's plenty of time for that. Come on, now. You've got to lie down out of this sun. Stop worrying. I'll find out what ranch after a while.She's worried about where you're taking us.So am I.Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?But you eat, don't you?Where do you keep the can opener?Marcia -- all of you. Come on.I see he did.Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.That's what I'm gettin' at. It never works. Don't forget we were thrown out of Aspen.But Jim isn't the only one you're marrying. He has folks and friends. What are they going to say? And how're they going to feel? I tell you, it won't work.And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.You've talked this over with them?And they don't like the idea!If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?Would you, Mr. Phillips?Don't you want him to hear your answer? Well, I know what it is. For the other fellow it's all right -- but not you. All you want is to get rid of one of us.No need to do that, Marcia.We've got two horses and they're four of us. So half of one of 'em is yours. The other half's a wedding present.Big-hearted fella. Can't see young love thwarted -- especially if it makes one less girl to worry about. That's all you really want, isn't it.Is that your kind of reading, Steve?You can't read?Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?But he just never troubled to have you get any schooling?Don't you even know your letters?Would you like to learn them?Maybe I could start you out.Did someone say I wasn't nice?Good night, Steve.There's a nice boy.That why you always took him on the other side of the street?Maybe I don't make the grade in some ways, but I know enough to teach a kid his letters.Like what?Where's Elaine?Elaine!Because she's sick.Elaine -- Elaine -- Elaine.Why not? You went farther than that last time.Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.He's learning his letters.Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.They're stragglin'.She should be in bed where it's dry.Can we get a doctor at that ranch?Is she very sick?So that was why she tried to run away.I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.We can't stay here!Back in the wagon.No. We're not stayin' --Everything's all mixed up, so don't ask questions.Go on, Steve.That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --No, thanks. I hope we won't be a burden to them.A time like this people ought to be alone. Having us around is going to make it sort of hard on 'em.I suppose it is.You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?You could have treated us like they did in Aspen. No. You wouldn't do a thing like that -- it isn't in you to be mean or cruel.No man who brings up a kid like you've brought up Steve could ever be cruel to people.I hope you get everything you want out of life --You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.You should know. She's in your dream.Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking.She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.But the rest is right.Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.I hope you find her -- because, like I said, you've earned your dream. Goodnight.I tried my best, but these things take time.There's still tomorrow morning.They are.Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.He certainly could. About a month.How many ways can a man say no.You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...What's the use.That's the end of the line.From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.Without someone to teach you, it's tough.He knows his alphabet.Maybe Clay will take up where I left off.You were right -- a man has only so many no's in him. But he had me worried -- that last one sounded so final.There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.Unicorn -- a kind of animal --Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.No.Would they be good to eat?Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.Well, Steve?Where you goin'? Over to the other side of the street?Are we leaving?You're not going out to look for them?Oh, I wasn't worrying. I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.And you've got me all figured out?You were supposed to be reading words.Better not let Clay catch you waitin' on us.But you're his brother.She was only teasin'.Let me do that.I know now.Don't you trust me?I like to see where I'm going.Maybe not! But I want to get there in one piece.Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.Just how do you mean that?So that's it -- You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.We might as well start a fire.Got a light?Roll me a cigarette, Clay.Thanks.Why didn't you wake me?You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.You don't mean that Clay.Tell me, darling.What does a man usually tell a girl?Tell me -- please --All right you don't love me. So let it go at that.I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it.Give it back to him. We're leavin'.I'm not raising horses or kids for anybody. I'm opening the slickest gambling house in California with a crystal chandelier, the biggest you ever saw ---- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?That's it then.If there were more men like you, there wouldn't be so many of us.It's nice to meet a man who doesn't want to own a woman from the day she was born. I never had the luck. The only kind I've run into were tramps or dirty-minded hypocrites.I don't care what he thinks.No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.All my clothes --For the wagon.Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.If you want to go on, I can make it all right.Thanks, Steve.Stop it -- both of you.I won't have you fighting over me.Steve --Mind sortin' out my things -- I'm leaving.Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.Because as you said, that's where I belong.Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.Goodbye, Steve. Don't fight with him any more.It's not his fault, just you remember that. It's mine. Don't ask me why because you couldn't understand now. Some day you will.Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.By the way, if you ever go past the Wyatt ranch, have another talk with Elaine.Is it very bad?Holding the lamp.Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.Goodnight.If you need me, I'll be --To the other side of the street.Why?I haven't got the job yet.But if you want to wait until tomorrow --", "clean_line": "came going sonora exactly decided gambling dancing bad people thank mr graham aspen want mr graham threw tried point pretty nosey citizens wouldn listen reason said aspen outgrown right play poker home saloon goodbye thanks came hill little fast wheel broke fix excitement surrey fix gift citizens aspen mary wells helen carter hanging going far far sonora going sonora solves ride wagon wouldn think asking won riding wagon leave good going ranch sonora jobs waiting ll pay trouble kind women maybe sonora excitement maybe heat surrey fix goin old folks gift citizens aspen mary wells helen carter come honeybunch changing trains nice kind wrangler letting ride wagon far ranch difference plenty time come ve got lie sun stop worrying ll ranch worried taking thanks isn supper making beds eat opener marcia come wanted married aspen told man sonora deal ve got stick like ve gettin works forget thrown aspen jim isn marrying folks friends going going feel tell won work look way jim puts sort tough spot ve talked like idea shoes home mr phillips want hear answer know fellow right want rid need marcia ve got horses half em half wedding present big hearted fella young love thwarted especially makes girl worry want isn kind reading steve read brother looked hasn troubled schooling know letters like learn maybe start wasn nice good night steve nice boy took street maybe grade ways know teach kid letters like elaine elaine sick elaine elaine elaine went farther time silly old learn learning letters learnin read right wrong street stragglin bed dry doctor ranch sick tried run away know wanted job man left stranded couldn leave street let stay wagon stayin mixed ask questions steve worryin tell maybe somethin gone puttin poor sick kid thanks hope won burden time like people ought having going sort hard em suppose explain tell grateful ve treated like aspen wouldn thing like isn mean cruel man brings kid like ve brought steve cruel people hope want life ve earned horse ranch toulomoe girl spotted gingham know dream ve looked steve ve dream ranch river good grass good water barn corral house ve shared steve girl gingham plan sneakin isn looking wears gingham dress cooks popovers makes jam season makes soap pig fat wood ashes cheeks color red apples rest right blonde new mop beautiful girl feed store calendar hope like said ve earned dream goodnight tried best things time tomorrow morning pa gets driving minden going minden stage reno auburn placerville day trip sonora certainly month ways man think elaine sake use end line figure mean words teach tough knows alphabet maybe clay left right man worried sounded final plenty use reading ll unicorn kind animal hmmm sort like horse horn center forehead good eat kind tough guess liable hunt think alive anyways sure think read stomach poetry instance poems world wouldn half bowl eatmeal feel good steve goin street leaving going look oh wasn worrying saw saddling thought ready leave ve got figured supposed reading words better let clay catch waitin brother teasin let know trust like going maybe want piece change mind bringing know thought sure thought mean think making fun girl gingham yes night think start got light roll cigarette clay thanks wake like leaving things unfinished mean clay tell darling man usually tell girl tell right love let expect minute ago hadn cuite waked awake want ll listen save em girl gingham tell good woman like change let started sooner sonora better ll like leavin raising horses kids anybody opening slickest gambling house california crystal chandelier biggest saw gaslights dance floor big bar cash registers bells couple boys armbands em ringing think men like wouldn nice meet man want woman day born luck kind ve run tramps dirty minded hypocrites care thinks right soaked hit rock clothes wagon spend rest trip expecting paid miles ve trying figure sleep sitting getting point think place named sonora want right thanks steve stop won fighting steve mind sortin things leaving maybe isn going sonora going right fine maybe ll said belong em mean em blame understand way thinking think way want women pedestals born em fall climb change somebody wants hand fool believe days somebody somebody wants maybe walk place working goodbye steve fight fault remember ask couldn understand day goodbye thanks lift way past wyatt ranch talk elaine bad holding lamp thanks loading stage know goodnight need ll street haven got job want wait tomorrow"}, "CLAY": {"raw_line": "A little hot.Rate you're goin', we'll be here until winter.You're too old to watch such goin's on.That's right.Don't you ever run down?You stick to your blacksmithin' and let me take care of Steve.We'll both take a look.

If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.Thanks.A man I used to know.Shells. How much for six boxes?Like what?I don't want to run short.No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me. How's she feel?One he's got, more his size.The thing to do is stick to rabbits.You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.I may as well buy it for him. Otherwise he'll be crying all the way over the hill.Yes.Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.All right. I'll tell you.Let's say this is the penitentiary.Here's Alder Crick.And here we are in Aspen.That's Sonora.motioning) Lednov gets out of jail and comes along here to Alder Crick. Then goes along here toward the Sonora road.That's Lednov! We come along here.Unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up.So let's go.Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.Anybody hurt?What's the matter with her?This must have been in the family a long time.I'm Clay Phillips. My brother Steve.Yes, ma'am.Just about.I've got eleven horses.Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.You can stay here if you like.I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.When you're old enough to smoke, I'll tell you. Get the horses started on ahead, will you, Steve?Let's get your stuff in the wagon. Like I said, I'll take you to the first ranch. I wish I could carry you all the way, but I can't. It's a tough trip and women would be in the way.You'll have to drive -- except down hill.What's the matter with her?It wouldn't happen to be this...This must have been in the family a long time.I'm Clay Phillips. My brother Steve.Stretch out under the seat, Miss.How's that?It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.So both of you stop worrying.There's a place down a ways, where you and the girls can wash some of that dust off.Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.In the grub box. Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.Swimming.When you get the team watered, rustle up some wood.Get your rifle.Hold it.Drop your gun.Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.So did I. They were in it.I'm glad you came along. My brother, Steve. I'm Phillips.I gave the girls a lift. Didn't know what else to do with them. Get your horse and come on.Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.Suppose they don't. This is his problem. He's over twenty-one. He wants to marry Marcia and Marcia wants to marry him so let 'em alone.I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.Go on, there's a good boy.I'm sorry. I can't do that. I went a long way to get those horses.Time to go to bed, Steve.Yeah.He doesn't know his letters, no -- but he knows the names of animals... he knows what roots to eat when you're clear out of food... He knows the difference between a possum and a coon just by lookin' at the tracks... more than most trappers know... and he can tell whether she'll rain or shine tomorrow by smelling the air tonight. There's a lot of things he doesn't know, I hope he'll never learn.Like sticking his nose into other people's business.What would she run off for?Stay here. One woman wanderin' off's enough.Build the fire up and stick close to it. Come on, Steve.Look around. She can't have gone far.Who shot who?I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?Look of things, she doesn't.How'd you happen to miss?Good thing you didn't.That's right, Steve.Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.Oh, Steve!Get back to the horses. They're straggling.Yeah. While the horses wander all over the country.Do like I said.Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?His letters will keep.Steve -- I want you to learn to read. I meant to teach you but I never seemed to find time. I figured when we got settled on the ranch we'd get around to it.It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.This isn't like other trips we've taken. For one thing, we've got a wagonload of women. For another there's a guy wanderin' around hopin' to put a bullet in my back.I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder. Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?And while you're there you might as well find out what comes after K.Yes, Ma'am, she should...But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.Only a little ways now -- maybe a mile.How's she makin' out?Steve --Mr. Wyatt.Clay Phillips.Three men on matched roans?The whole state's lookin' for 'em. And they're lookin' for me.Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.I picked up some women on the road.But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.And one of 'em is sick.Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?Hold on.It's a long walk back to Aspen.I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.I can't take her with me.You're not bein' quite fair.I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.I can't take her with me.You're not bein' quite fair.This will be your room until Mr. Wyatt finds time to take you to the nearest stage station.Coffee?I hope so, too.If you're figuring on asking me to take you, it's no use.I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.Thanks.The who?Go on. Tell me more about her.I'll make the soap myself.Will she be dark or fair?Well, I'm off --What's the matter?I can't --No they won't.That's fine.Finished, son?I'll round up the horses. Throw that junk in the wagon.Don't go arguing with your teacher.There's a lot of things I don't see any sense to. But make up your mind. Learn to read or -- -- go back and watch the horses.We're staying here until dark. Pull over to the woods. You put hobbles on the horses -- all of 'em. Get goin'.It's too light yet.Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead. So I'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail.Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.Did you ever care where you were goin' or where you'd been?Why do you think?Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.You know so much about me -- figure it out.You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?That's the West Walker. Take it easy now.Followin' it. Any reason I shouldn't?Clay Phillips of Aspen. Been havin' trouble?Neither do we. That's why we took this trail instead of the main road, and drove all night.Just the grub box and bed rolls.When you get older you'll understand things better. Like women and men. Just because a man kisses a woman, doesn't always mean -- well, he can kiss her and not want to -- have her around all the time.We got a lot to do, you and I. Gettin' that ranch started and everything. We've been getting along fine, all these years. For a while I want to keep it the way it is.Take that in and help her get breakfast, will you?Maybe it's better that way.What?What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.All right -- it's said!She's aimin' at me, but her aim's bad. Want to know why I changed my mind about bringing you? Because I talked to Elaine -- because I was afraid to leave you with decent people, that's why. And you'll open your joint all right. You wouldn't fit anywhere else.Let's round up the horses.Come on -- we don't want to keep the people in Sonora waiting.Mary --Are you all right?I suppose that's my fault.That's right -- worry about your clothes --What about my wagon. Of all the crazy fool things to do. You lose a man's wagon because you're stupid and then yell about your clothes.There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.Don't just stand there. Go on back and get the packs on the horses. We've lost all the time we're going to because of a woman.Come on. Didn't you hear me?So am I and so are the horses.Take the packs off. And run the horses into the corral.I said take the packs off.I figure we'll make better time, letting the horses rest for a spell.So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.Like I said, I was thinkin' of the horses.If you want 'em to find us, why don't you go up on the hill and wave your shirt or fire your rifle.You better start.All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.Maybe you're not hungry, but I am.Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.Shut up and eat.I'm sorry.It's going to Sonora.I said a lot of things -- some of 'em --I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.If you're gonna catch this stage, come on.Hurry up.Maybe they will.Mind giving a lady a lift into town?Will you be seeing the sheriff?Goodbye, Mary.I don't care what she asked you.You want to split up? ---- Why wait? Go on, saddle up now and beat it.You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.There you are.What did you come back for?Is that the only reason you came back?I just wondered. Let's go.Stick here.Come on out.How's that?You'll live.Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.Thanks for taking over.Like I said, women get in the way sometimes.Where you going?Mary.That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.Is there any place in town a man could buy some gingham?", "clean_line": "little hot rate goin ll
