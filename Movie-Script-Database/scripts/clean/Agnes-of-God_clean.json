{"Agnes-of-God": {"MARTHA": {"raw_line": "What about Roger? He's free.Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.Eve, she strangled a baby!Today's my birthday. I always make bad decisions on my birthday.Bonjour, I'm Doctor Martha Livingston, I...Well... I...Yes... I...... Thank you.You were a smoker?I can beat that.Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?How did she hide it from the other nuns?Is that normal?How did she hide it during the day?Didn't she have any physical examinationsWho was the father?What man had access to her?Was there a priest?What's his name?Could there have been anyone else?And you didn't try to find out who?Why haven't you asked her?Look, someone gave her the baby.Why do you think that?Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.The science of psychiatry.I am not with the Inquisition.Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?You have a lovely voice.I just heard you.Was it Sister Marguerite?Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?What would you like to talk about.Anything... may I sit down?First thing that comes to your mind?Second thing that comes to your mind.Have you ever loved anyone?Who?Well, who in particular?Uh huh.Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?Who?Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?Do you think he loves you?He's told you?You've been alone together?Often?And you like that?Where do you meet?Agnes, do ever see Father Martineau outside the...Would you like to talk about it?Why should they?Do you remember the night they said it came?How were you sick?Did it hurt?Where?And what did you do?And what happened?In the middle of all the pain?Where did the baby come from?The baby they made up.Is that where they say it came from... ?Where'd it come from before that?After God... before the waste-paper basket.Agnes, how are babies born?Yes I do, but I want you to...Then let's talk about something else...Agnes...Would you like to ask them?Just that... you ask and I'll answer.Anything.Martha Louise Livingston.No.Not at the moment, no.No.I can't have them any more.I've stopped menstruatingDoes it bother you?Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?What?From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.Do you know a Marie?Why should I?What's your opinion?From other nuns... Yes I... I've noticed.How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?So, someone else could have done it.And in your eyes?That she was unconscious, yes! So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...It's possible isn't it?One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.That possibility never occurred to you?Is Father Martineau in please?And you're the only man to see them?Hello, Mama ... brought you something.It's your favourite...It's Martha, Mama. There you go.I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?Marie's dead Mama.Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!I... I'm Martha, Mama.How do you survive?Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?The one up on the third floor?Uh huh.Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?And you weren't shocked?And what happened?This was before her pregnancy?Why didn't you take her to a doctor?She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand! She could have bled to death.She has it now.Not simple, no.It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it?Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.I know my job. Don't tell me my job Lyon. My duty as a doctor is to...No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.Why?And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.I'm fighting for this woman's life, not some bloody bishop.You liked Sister Paul?What else did she tell you?Where's that?... I promise I won't tell, would you take me?Sister Paul was in her eighties? Did she climb up here often?No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?Like what?I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down.Beautiful...What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl.Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?You have trouble sleeping?What things?How did she know that?Who?Agnes...I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?Did your mother see angels often?Do you?Do you believe she really saw them?Why not? Mmm?Agnes, did you love your mother?Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?Why not?Why not?If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?Like you?How would that person get one if they didn't want one?Agnes, how did your mother get you?Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...... that you don't remember getting pregnant...... and that you don't believe you carried a child.What the child?Agnes...What?I hate ignorance and stupidity.I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.How dare you tell me to run my affairs!How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are? You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...??? ... virginity, right Mother? Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.Then help her.No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.There's another choice.Aquittal.Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.Answers.When would Agnes have conceived the child?Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?Visitors to the convent.Do you have a... a diary or a day book?Take at look at it.What is it?What sheets?When was that?Sister Paul?No.Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.What does this have to do with..?Who told you this?What business is it of yours..?Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.But you're troubled... aren't you?And you're unhappy.Agnes...Sometimes, yes.What did you do?What did you do?Agnes. What did your mother do to you? If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you? Did she make you do something you didn't want to? Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it? Did it embarrass you? Did it... did it hurt you? What did she make you you do?You can tell me.She's dead isn't she?She can't hurt you any more.How?Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.Yes?Yes?She tells you you're ugly?And that you're stupid?That you're a mistake?Why?How does she know that?Oh, yes.What?Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?Please! I want to help you. Let me help you.Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?Are you pretty?Agnes, you're stupid.Are you intelligent?You're a mistake.Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.I really love you.As much as God loves you.Agnes? Who? Mother Superior?What?Sister...Oh, Good afternoon Sister, I... I'm looking for some biographical data on Sister Agnes, and Mother said I might find it here.Thank you.You lied to meYour niece!No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?And Agnes' father?Like keeping her home from school?Listening to angels?Do you know what she did to her?She molested her!There is more here than meets the eye isn't there? Lots of dirty little secrets.Why didn't you? You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.Why didn't you do anything to stop her?Oh, God.Larry...Larry there's got to be something missing.I don't know.Larry...Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.Thanks.I've gotten the court's permission to hypnotise her.I'd like yours too.Don't deny it!The woman's health is at stake.I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.Sentence her and be done with it, that's what you're saying and I...An unhappy woman...Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh?Bullshit!Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...You just said...Nothing...It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was runThat's all? That's enough! She was a beautiful little girl.I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me? I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles.My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear. Does my smoking bother you?Would you like one? Huh?All right?Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?Long, thin and filtered.Hand rolled.Saint Peter?Right...Oh, you've come a long way baby.Right. What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?Do you think they ever existed?Do you want to become one?Well you can try, can't you, to be good?Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?I'd like to begin.The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?No.Of course.You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.Who am I?And why am I here?Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?What kind of trouble? What kind of trouble Agnes?Of what?But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?How did you have a baby?Did you know what was going to comeDid you want it to come out?Why?Why were you afraid?To be a mother?Why?No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?What made it grow? Do you know?Would you like to tell me?Did anyone else know about the baby?Will she be angry?Who? Who made you promise? It's alright Agnes. It's alright. Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?You don't like brussel sprouts?And then what happened?Hm hmm.What is it?Who?Was it Sister Marguerite who knew about the baby? Alright Agnes, I want you to see your room as you saw it on that night.What else?Above the bed? Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different? What is it?Do you know who put it there?What do you think it's there for?Are you ill?What do you feel?What do you do?Which one?Of what?Why isn't anyone coming?What is it?Who?Is someone in the room with you?NO... no... I said leave her alone.Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two three... It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston, it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes, thankyou. How do you feel?Do you remember what just happened?That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?There you go. It's alright, it's alright, it's all over. It's alright Agnes, that's right, that's right.That's how he got in... or she got out.Nothing. May I take some notes?It's... it's alright Helen, just close the door.You're what?One that will ask the questions you want asked.For the Church?You think she's a saint?How? How? She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.Who is he?My God, you're as crazy as...How ?Well give me a reasonable explanationThis is insane.You're saying God did it?But how did it happen?I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.That's what I have to believe...There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.Somebody told her.Oh, would you stop lying Mother!Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.Who was that person Mother? Was it you?All I want is one more week.Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.I'll have a decision by next week.Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.I'll have it.Next week.Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.Where is she?I have a few more questions to ask her.Who knew she was pregnant?Was it you?Did you know she was pregnant?And you didn't send her to a doctor.For what? An abortion?Too late for what?The baby?You went to the room to help with the birth.You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.And the baby.You tied the cord around its neck.Before or after you killed the child?I doubt that's what she'd say.Agnes, can you hear me?I want you to remember if you can a night last January. The night Sister Paul died. Do you remember.What did she mean?And the passage to the barn?Why?Who?How did she know about him?Where?So she sent you?What happened?Are you frightened?What do you see?Oh Agnes...Agnes... Agnes...Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.Agnes who did you see?Of course you do. Who was it?Yes.Who?Agnes, who did this to you?Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.Agnes, what happened to the baby?What happened to the baby?It was alive wasn't it?Wasn't it!Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?She took the baby in her arms?You saw it all didn't you?And then... what did she do? Agnes what did she do?What did you do?H... how?I don't know the meaning behind the song she sang. Perhaps it was a song of seduction. And the father was a fieldhand. Perhaps the song was simply a lullaby that she remembered from many years ago. And the father was hope and... and love and desire. And a belief in miracles.I want to believe that she was blessed. And I do miss her, and I hope that she's left something, some little part of herself with me.

not.Let's talk about something else.I don't know.Yes.God! But there's nothing to say about God.Love.Yes.Everyone.Right now?I love you.Yes.Oh, there are so many.Oh, yes!Oh, I know he does.No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.Yes.At least once a week.Oh, yes.In the confessional.You want to talk about the baby don't you?I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.I don't know.No. I was sick.Something I ate.Yes.Down... there.I went to my room.I got sicker.I fell asleep.Yes.What baby?From their heads...No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!From God.I... I don't understand.Don't you know?I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wantsNo... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.What do you mean?Anything?What's your real name?Are you married?Would you like to be?Do you have any children?Would you like some?Why not?Why do you smoke?No questions.One.Where do you think babies come from?Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes.No... do you?I don't know.I've been commanded by God.No.Yes.I can't say.She'd punish me.No.Because I'm getting fat.I am, there's too much flesh on me.I'm a blimp.Because...I do, I have to be attractive to God.No he doesn't. He hates fat people.It's a sin to be fat.Look at the statues, they're thin.That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.But she watches... she listens.I'm not hungry.No I don't... the host is enough.Of God.I'm being punished.I don't know.It started this morning and I can't get it to stop.Last Tuesday, I didn't eat all of my lima beans... hid them under my spoon.I thought... thoughts... about...I thought ugly thoughts about Sister Marguerite.She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.She said you could see the whole world from up here. But it looks much better far away than it looks close up.And sometimes I get under here... it makes a wonderful sound.Oh, it's even more wonderful then.Where did you go?No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.Somebody told her.I don't know.You'll laugh.An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.No.No.No, but I can never tell her that.She'd get angry.Yes.I could never be a mother.Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.Because I don't want one.From someone who didn't want to have a baby.A mistake...A mistake... it was a mistake...If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint...I can't help it if I'm stupid.Not my fault.I was a mistake.Everything... I don't have children.Don't touch me like that! You don't touch me like that, I know what you want from me, you want to take God away. You should be ashamed, they should lock you up people like you.Yes Mother.In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.It made them holy.No.I burnt them.They were stained.Yes, Mother.It's not that... it's not that...It's not my time of month.I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened. I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.I don't know... I don't know...I'm not sick.That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren'tAnswer me! You never answer me.Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.I'm always bad.I breathed!No...I can't.Yes.She can.She watches... she listens.She...... makes me...... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.Yes.Yes.She says my whole body's a mistake.Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.Her headaches.And then...She touches me down there with a cigarette. Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good, I won't be a baby any more.I'm afraid.Alright.No I'm not.Yes.No I'm not.Yes I am.I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...Do you really love me or are you just saying that?As much as Mother Miriam does?Yes.Doctor Livingston.To help me.Because I'm in trouble.I'm frightened.Of telling you.I had a baby.It came out of me.Yes.No.Because I was afraid.Because I wasn't worthy.Yes.May I open my eyes now?It grew.Yes.No.She made me promise not to.I'm afraid.I ate.Fish... ... brussel sprouts.I hate them.We went to chapel for vespers.I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.Someone's following me.Sister Marguerite I think.My bed.A crucifix.A wastepaper basket.No.For me to get sick in.Yes.I feel as if I've eaten glass.I have to throw up...I don't know which oneOf me. Oh... God! My God... Water... it's all water...They can't hear me that's why. Oh God... I don't wanna...Go away, I don't want you here.No... don't hit me please...Frightened.Yes.Yes.She said Michael.The statue. She had shown it to me the day before.Yes.So I could go to him.Him.She'd seen him too.From the belltower the day she before she died.Yes.He's here.Yes.Hallo...... where are you?Is it you?Halos...... dividing and dividing feathers and starts, falling, falling into the iris of God's eye. Oh... oh!... it's... it's so lovely... it's so... blue... yellow... blood wings, brown, blood...His blood... my God...It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop. Let go of me, I wish you were dead.Stay away from me...No...Not your fault...I hate him...I hate him for what he did to me.For what he made me go through.I hate him.God! It was God. And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.It was dead.I don't remember.YES!Yes.Yes.She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.I put her to sleep.I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.I stood in the window of my room every night for a week.
