{"Face-Off": {"ARCHER": {"raw_line": "Any follow-up from L.A.P.D. Intelligence?Get them on the phone -- now. What about S.I.S. and our airport teams?He's here! And we're going to keep looking until we find him!I'll cut them some slack when I cut myself some slack.... I don't have time to get a warrant from some hung-over judge. Just give me the go-ahead, Victor, and I promise -- as soon as this is over -- you can brand my butt with the Fourth Amendment.Tell her to hang on --Scramble the Reaction Team -- we're moving out. And get one of our people on that plane.Where one brother goes, the other's sure to follow...Get out.Get out!That's what you always say. Seal it off. I'm going in.And how much will your 'fun' net you this time?You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --No discussion -- no deals.Real fine, Victor. Especially the casualties.Hi... ... What's wrong?Nice stunt, Jamie. You break the law and I'm expected to ignore it?Okay. What happened?Why won't she even talk to me?Eve...I'm going to make everything up to you and Jamie. I'll put in for a desk job. We'll go away, get counseling -- anything you want. This time, I mean it.Much appreciated. Now let's get back to work, okay?Send it back and tell them to stop wasting the taxpayers' money. Anything else, Miss Brewster?How's Loomis?Go on.I don't have time for those cloak and dagger guys.Porcelain casing... Thermal cloak... Undetectable payload.'Worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs.' Get Pollux Troy. Now.He's lying.Pollux is a manipulative psychopath. He can control his heartbeat, his sweat glands, his blood pressure...You'll get all the evidence you need when ten thousand people die.That bomb has been built, it's out there somewhere and it's going to detonate...Only one person knows -- his brother Pollux. And he'll keep his mouth shut until it blows.Pollux is way too paranoid. The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is Castor himself. And dead men can't talk.Why are you keeping him alive? As long as he's breathing, he's dangerous.What are you talking about?I know who you are.This'll fool Pollux.You're talking about removing the guy's face?Find yourself another lab-rat.I'm in a hurry, Dietrich. So you've only got ten seconds to go through your usual litany of lies, empty threats, and moronic denials. Then I'm coming over there --You're a dealer, all right: technical secrets, munitions... explosives.Time's up.Let him go, but I want him watched... Who's next?When was the last time you saw Castor Troy?Answer the question.Sasha -- you are a felon, on probation for harboring Castor Troy. So it's in your best interest to cooperate. Would you like your son put in a foster home?When was the last time you saw Castor Troy?What about Lazarro?I'm in.Something good?Did you catch me?How come?Come on, you made that up, didn't you?After all these years, I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.Eve...... If I had to do something to find some closure... I should do it, shouldn't I?... No matter how crazy?One last time. And while I'm gone, I want you and Jamie to go to your mother's. It's important...I can't tell you... except only I can do it.Don't worry... If Hoag can do half what he claims, I'll get Pollux to talk.Keep this for me.Abdomino -- what?Do it.Okay... I'm okay. But my voice... I still sound like me.Now what?Don't forget -- I ordered a kosher meal...They're too tight.Fabrice Voisine... sure, I -- -- I believe Jon Archer busted you for poisoning five members of the the Canadian parliament?Do I look wasted -- asshole?Never -- in -- the -- face.What? He started it!When I get out of here --I'm going to have you fired.-- Pollux?Why?I was in a coma...My reflexes, my senses, my memory... everything's jumbled. I can't even tell you why Dubov jumped me yesterday.I've forgotten plenty. Look around -- we've screwed over half the freaks in here. What's gonna happen to us if they think I've lost it?I need you to play big brother for once -- till I can fill in a few blanks. Think you can handle that?I know I got this on my tenth birthday. I just can't remember why.Oh, God -- Mom O-D'd at County General.Uh -- to kill the doctors?And I bet I kept that promise...Screw the past. We've got the future to look forward to. We still have tomorrow.That's not the worst part.Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows. What you built was a work of art. It belongs in the Smithsonian.Thanks, Pollux.-- Castor...?It can't be. It's impossible.You killed them?He doesn't know anything about this!Castor, don't do this --Pollux is -- what?Walton, you have to listen to me -- right now!Don't they ever let us take off these boots?You mean if I get sick?What did he do?As a matter of fact -- yes.Dubov -- come on!Let's go!Come on... come on...Dr. Archer please. It's an emergency. -- Her husband.Hello, Eve -- I know this sounds crazy, but -- Dammit.Eve, listen carefully. The man you think is your husband -- isn't.Please, just listen! Take Jamie and go to your mother's in Santa Fe. Don't tell him where you're going -- just go.I need to speak to Director Lazarro immediately... I have information about Castor Troy.Well, if you're Jon Archer... I guess this must be Castor Troy...If you were really me, you'd know -- no discussion, no deals.No, Jon... you have to think like Castor. Where would he go...?Yeah -- me.Drive. And punch up your cellular -- I need you to make some calls.You're already busted, Dietrich. It's just a matter of time before they pick you up.You can't say no to money.You're Castor Troy... This is your old crew -- you don't take shit and you don't take no for an answer...Archer doesn't want you, he wants me! But I'm going to get him first -- with your help.You wanna face-off with Castor Troy? Come on, then! Come on! 'Cause I've had a real bad day...You're all forgetting who the real enemy is. Six months ago, Jon Archer hauled you in for questioning. He rattled you so bad -- you shit your Armani suit right there in the interrogation room.You laugh, Fitch -- the way Archer laughed at your last arraignment, when you got down on your knees and tried to blow your way to freedom.And nobody's untouchable if we say he's not.We start with your basic kidnapping. Then -- a little surgery.I'm going to rearrange his face in a way you won't believe.To old jobs, new jobs and -- uh -- blow jobs?Sorry... I don't...Sure I remember... Once a quarter, right?-- Sasha Hassler. Age 35. Met Castor Troy in Austin, Texas, at Pearl Jam reunion... Uh, how you doing, baby?Uh -- can't we just talk?Not until I finish my business with your brother.I know I've done some things that made your life harder...I'm not the same person you remember. And for what it's worth, I'm sorry...Not a bad fit.Nice-looking kid, tooHow old is he?He's not my son.Get down!Buzz...Dietrich! The painting!Off Kanan Road -- I know it.Get the boy out of here...That's about a thousand years bad luck...Eve...I'm not going to hurt you. Just don't scream, okay? Okay?-- I called, but I'm not Castor. I'm your husband.Now, you're going to listen. The last time we saw each other -- was in this room. We had a fight after I told you I had to go away. My assignment -- Jon Archer's assignment -- was to enter a federal prison as Castor Troy.An F.B.I. surgeon gave me Castor's face. He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything. But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me.If you need hard evidence, get it. Your husband's blood type is O negative. Castor's is A.B.Remember the parachute dream? I'm falling, Eve... I'm falling...Thanks for believing me.What are you doing? Where did you get that gun?Why point it at me? I'm the real thing.What more proof do you need?... I took a date out for chicken and ribs -- not knowing she was a vegetarian. When the night couldn't get worse, she broke her tooth on a pebble that got into her three-bean salad Somehow she and I had fun driving around looking for an all-night dentist... And even though it must have hurt -- you still kissed me.Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --Good. What's his schedule tomorrow?Victor... Tito... they both died thinking I killed them... And in a way... I did.-- What happens after the memorial?And neither of you will be coming back. Where's the service?Hit him with a trank dart. Once he's unconscious -- I'll try to get to Buzz and Wanda before the security team gets to me.Think up a good excuse. I don't want you or Jamie anywhere near that service.I've always needed you...Terrible. But it's the best we can do with what we have. If it doesn't happen, take Jamie and don't look back...Do doctors travel in packs?How's the boy?'Us'? No, Sasha -- believe me, this isn't your fight.Thanks...This is between you and me. Leave them out of this.No father could.I know some things that even you don't know, Caz. You have a son. I've met him. His name is Adam...Find Jamie!Give up, Castor. People are going to find out.No, Jamie. Don't do it!Listen to my voice, Jamie. I'm your father.Jamie...Okay, I have a confession to make... but you aren't gonna like it... You're right, I won't shoot you. Not in the face anyway.What did you call me?How is he?That's what they always say...Hello, Eve.I have something to ask you -- to ask both of you...This is Adam.

I have a confession to make, but you aren't gonna like it. I was planting a bomb.You know -- boom -- Oh, never mind...I've never enjoyed 'The Messiah.' But your voice makes even a hack like Handel seem like a genius.Oh, God -- !I forgot to turn the damn thing on!Bro -- everything went fine.Thanks for babysitting.I'll contact you when we get the rest of the money. Oh, and stat away from downtown. The inversion layer's going to be pretty thick around the 18th.Let's go, let's go!Hell, yes... It's the only way to fly.What's wrong?It's Archer. Go, dammit!What are you doing?Wherever they put you, I'll find a way to get you out...Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.What's it to you? I declare it. Here I am, back in the States for less than a week --I've got something going down on the eighteenth... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaoh. I'll give it up -- but my brother and I have to walk.What're you gonna do with me locked up? You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?Lars... okay, Lunt, then. Something really fucked-up happened... I'm in trouble... so listen very carefully...What do you think I want?Not anymore.I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was 'titanically remote'. Who knows? Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out. Or maybe God really is on my side after all. By the way, I know you don't get the papers in here.Terrible tragedy. Hoag was such a genius -- but selfish with his artistry. I actually had to torture his assistants to convince him to perform the same surgery on me.Of course I killed them, you dumb fuck. Hoag, his staff...Miller and Brodie --I even paid a visit to your buddy Tito.Come on, Jon. I think I know you better than that. I only wish you could have been there to see the look on his face ---- then again, I guess you were there. I torched every shred of evidence that proves who you are. So swallow this -- you are going to be in here for the rest of your life.No discussion, Jon -- no deals. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, and a beautiful wife to fuck. Excuse me -- I mean 'make love to.'It's quite all right. You never know what to expect from a psychopathic criminal...Jesus, what a life.Sorry -- the job's been murder lately.What do you know about it?It didn't work out the way everyone thought it would. Where are you off to?Surgery -- are you okay?Have fun at work.Don't I usually kiss my wife?What a dump.'... \"Date-night\" has been a typical failure... we haven't made love in almost two months...' What a loser ...The plot thickens.I'm coming in, Janie.I don't think you heard me... Jamie... You have something I want ...I won't tell mom if you don't.You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here -- Daddy's a new man.Yeah, well, shit happens.How's our star witness?Just let me do my job, Victor.You're supposed to be snitching -- making me look good.I'm the one who has to look at this butt-ugly mug every time I pass a mirror. Look at my eyes, my chin, my perfect nose -- gone! Archer took my life, so I'm taking his. Bro, I'm going straight.Imagine Dillinger as J. Edgar Hoover. Carlos the Jackal running Interpol. Kaddafi heading the Mossad. Think of the secrets we could sell...That's just the bottom of the food chain. Pollux -- what would happen if somebody planted a bomb on Air Force One?Pissed-off, vulnerable... looking for someone to step in, take charge, give them hope again. What if that someone was an F.B.I. hero? A true Boy Scout and family man -- with a spotless past. Imagine where that guy could land -- if the timing's right.Not yet he isn't. But after you 'confess' -- you'll be a free man. And I'll be on my way...Evacuate your team, Captain.Just go!That's classified. But if he's listening I have a message for him: Nice try. Now you know who's really in charge.Don't you guys watch TV? Where's the parade?-- Loomis, Buzz, uh -- Wanda... all of you, thanks from the bottom of my heart. Thanks for enduring all those years I was an insufferable boor. From now on -- consider me reborn.Jon, your career is finally taking of. Archer. Sure I'll hold...Mr. President, what an honor...How about a game of horse?Afraid you'll lose?'H.'Try putting a higher arc on the ball... and square your shoulders to the basket.Don't tell me you forgot. Eve -- it's date night!It's important to keep some mystery... so things stay... unpredictable.Gone?I'm not going anywhere.I bet I deserved that. I bet Jon Archer is the most inattentive, sexless spouse on Earth.Of course it's true, but I'm trying to change? I'm here because I want to be alone with you. I want to see the candle- light dance in your beautiful ---- brown eyes.I wanted it all to be just right... when I told you about my promotion.Well, I don't have it yet. But Lazarro's getting old -- he won't be around forever. And I'm getting the itch to move up.So you see, I'm not going anywhere. Unless it's upstairs with you...baby, it's like I'm having you for the first time.I couldn't sleep -- you roll around a lot. Anyway, I'm late.Can't we skip it just this once? I gotta 'protect and serve', you know.Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive.So who's this Karl creep Jamie's been seeing? He's a little old for her, isn't he?Sure, how could I forget. By the way, you never said anything about last night...Stop crying... stop crying... stop ...What happened?He's -- what?Where's the body?'It hasn't been recovered yet!' You people have no idea who you're dealing with! I want everyone on this, reports on the half hour, and all leads get routed through my office. Buzz, alert the L.A.P.D.He's alive -- and he's already here. Move!This is Jon Archer. Who's calling?I've gotta hand it to you, Jon. You're doing a damn respectable job of being me. But let's face it, we both liked it better the way it was. So before the cops blow your brains out -- why not tell me where you are...Who are you to call Jon Archer a wimp?What are you -- stupid?Did it look like I was siding with him? Did it? You want to play with scummy organ grinders, you better be prepared. Do you have protection?I mean like... protection.Next time -- slip it in low, then twist it -- so the wound doesn't close.Go on, get out of here.No wonder he spent all his time chasing me. Who can deal with this family shit?Jon Archer. Where is he?We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.I've never been more certain of anything. Get everyone in position. Remember -- shoot to kill.It's too late, Jon. Your kid loves me. And your wife's an animal. Even I can't keep up with her.Tonight I'm going to make her come like Niagara Falls -- to celebrate your death.Pollux...Get a medic -- now!What the fuck do you think happened? Castor Troy just shot him! What are you waiting for? Go!What is it?Me -- 'erratic'? Victor, what are you talking about?Okay, Vic, I have a confession to make. But you aren't gonna like it... I'm Castor Troy.Now you understand.Cancel my four o'clock. And send for the paramedics. Victor Lazarro's having a heart attack.Where should I be? Where's everyone else?What?Obviously someone else knows it! Get everybody back to their posts -- now!I want you guys here around-the- clock. And stay off the lawn.You're all in knots. Maybe another date night will help you relax...You think I've been acting strange. Like a completely different person.Okay, I have a confession to make. But you aren't going to like it...And to prove it, I'm taking you and Jamie away on a trip -- right after the memorial service.Victor Lazarro had a heart seizure... right in my office. It was horrible...First Tito... now Victor... ... please don't tell me I'm going to lose you, too...What was that?Something bit me.That's what you're going to explain to me.Not as ill as he's going to be...Sorry. But what's a guy to think when his wife runs off in the middle of the night?Stay here. Watch her like a hawk.Who cares? She's going to be dead by tonight anyway. They're all going to be dead. The wife, the kid... and the father.Where's Jamie?I'll deal with her later.Lars -- take Jamie, bring the car around, then meet us at that boathouse...Come on, baby. I've got a surprise for you.Look who we caught creeping around -- Castor Troy.Before I turn him in, I thought we'd pay him back for everything he's put us through...Come on, baby. Join the fun --Too bad. Part of me was hoping you didn't know.Did you really think it would be that easy, you dumb fucks? Sorry, baby. Castor Troy is about to murder you and our daughter... but I promise you won't die unavenged.It was between you and me. Even your little boy -- that wasn't supposed to happen. But you couldn't let it go.Appealing to my sense of 'family' won't work, Jon. I thought you knew me better than thatI imagine I've got a dozen kids -- so what? No more head games... First your wife dies. Then your daughter. Then you.Just one big happy family...Dietrich -- Aldo -- Sasha?You're making a mistake. I'm Castor -- he's Archer. Sasha, baby -- just give me a minute to explain!Not if I kill you first.Give it here, Jamie.It's a trick, Jamie. I'm your father.Shoot him, Jamie.Shoot him!You dunce. No kid of mine would miss so badly.Just saving the taxpayers the cost of a trial. So take a hike.I'm ordering you to back off!Can't blame me for trying.Say goodbye to Daddy --You ungrateful delinquent!Give me your weapon -- now!You won't shoot me, Jon.
