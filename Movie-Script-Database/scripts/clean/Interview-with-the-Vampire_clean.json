{"Interview-with-the-Vampire": {"LOUIS": {"raw_line": "So you want me to tell you the story of my life...You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.You followed me here, didn't you?It's just a room...I'm a vampire.Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.Perhaps lucky for both of us.I'll tell you my story. All of it. I'd like to do that very much.Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.Don't be frightened. I want this opportunity.The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.But times were different then. I was a man at that age. The master of a large plantation just south of New Orleans...I had just lost my wife in childbirth. She and the infant had been buried less than half a year.I was twenty-four and life seemed finished. I couldn't bear the pain of their loss. I longed for a release from it.I wanted to lose everything. My wealth, my estate, my sanity. But Lady Luck didn't oblige.You're calling me a cheat?Then do me a favor. Get rid of this piece of shit...You lack the courage of your convictions, sir. Do it.Most of all I longed for death. I know that now. I invited it, a release from the pain of living...My invitation was open to anyone. Sailors, thieves, whores and slaves...But it was a vampire that accepted.Then my luck would have changed.Yes...Enough...No. The Gift of Darkness requires more than that, as you'll see.He left me half dead that morning. he wanted something from me. He came back the following night.Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?Why should I be?What do you want from me?Diane!!!!NO!!!!!Give it to me!!!I want it!My last sunrise. That morning I was not yet a vampire, and I saw my last sunrise. I remember it completely, yet I don't remember any sunrise before it. I watched the whole magnificence of the dawn for the last time, as if it were the first. And the I said goodbye to sunlight and went out to become what I became.How do you mean, start?Carlos!!!I can't do it.Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.I can't go through with it, I tell you.But why do you want me?Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -Yes...Yes...No. Don't leave me here. Give it to me.Sure...Dying?I want a woman.The crucifix -What have I done?Dear God, what have I done?Dear God, what have I become????Oh, that rumor about crosses?Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...Killing is no ordinary act. It is the experience of another's life for certain. That night I had lost my own life and taken another's. I was drowning in a sea of human guilt and regret, with all the heightened senses of a vampire...It can't be...And if I don't?You told me something earlier. You said you didn't have a choice. Was that true?Dear God, what have I done?I awoke the next evening to a different world. And I realized there are as profound differences between vampires as between human beings...I sat there staring at him with contempt. He had the soul of a shopkeeper, he was the sow's ear out of which nothing fine could be made. I felt sadly cheated in having him as a teacher...Do you think so?I looked at anything mortal and saw all life as precious, condemning all fruitless guilt and passion that would let it slip through the fingers like sand...It was only as a vampire that I could see Yvette's beauty. Her fear of me increased my desire.I will finish it, Yvette. Now leave us.We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?Fascination...But we can live without taking human life. It's possible.This was New Orleans, a magical and magnificent place to live. In which a vampire, richly dressed might attract no more notice in the evening than hundreds of other exotic creatures.Have you ever been caught?Lestat killed two, sometimes three a night. A fresh young girl, that was his favorite for the first of the evening.But the triumphant kill of Lestat was a young man. They represented the greatest loss to Lestat because they stood on the threshold of the maximum possibility of life.But how do you know?I can't.What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.You want to see me kill? Watch me kill you then -Being a vampire to him meant revenge. Revenge against life- itself. Every time he took a life it was revenge. and the slaves with a wisdom that was denied their masters, began to notice...Paris? You came from Paris?Tell me about him. You must have learnt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.No, ma cher. I need no supper. Is all well at Pointe Du Lac tonight?Leave me alone now, Yvette.I am frightened of myself, Yvette.Hush, Yvette -This place is cursed. Damned, do you hear me? And your master is the devil.Get out while you can. You're free men.Unlike me, you are no free men...Do I have to convince you?What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!Where are we?We belong in hell.Can a vampire feel love?I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.Yes, I loved Yvette. As I loved Pointe Du Lac. And as with each thing I loved, I destroyed it.Lestat I did not love. And he survived.I'm leaving you. I can't stand this any longer.I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.I don't pretend to know.Lestat, she's alive!!!The girl, Lestat -Why do you do this Lestat?Lestat - finish this -NO!!!My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...Am I damned? Am I from the devil? Is my very nature that of a devil? And all the while, as these dreaded questions caused me to neglect my thirst, my thirst grew hotter, my veins were threads of pain in my flesh, my temples throbbed.The way I came...... and finally, when I could stand it no longer, I stood in an empty desolate street and heard the sound of a child crying.And if I am damned, why do I fell such pity for her gaunt face? Why do I wish to warm her tiny arms? Comfort her beating heart?For years I had not savored a human. And when I had Lestat's words made sense to me. I knew peace only when I killed and when I heard her heart in that terrible rhythm I knew again what peace could be. Yet even then I could not contenance it...No...Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?What are you saying?Lestat!I didn't want to kill her.Lestat, what do you mean?What have you done?You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!You fiend. You monster.Shall we go on?Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I would love her more than the waking world. But there was more to it than that. Perhaps in the end he did it - to show me that he could. For he lavished affection on her, there was no doubt about that. Life was very different with madame Claudia, as you can imagine...A little child she was, but also a fierce killer, now capable of the ruthless pursuit of blood with all a child's demanding.She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...Mute and beautiful, she played with dolls, dressing them and undressing them by the hour.Mute and beautiful, she killed. And to watch her kill was chilling.They found death fast in those days, before she learnt to play with the, to delay the moment till she had taken what she wanted...She grew, yet stayed the same. She wanted a bed of her own, yet would climb back into mine.How did you learn to write, Claudia?Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.He jests.Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.Claudia! You did that?Time can pass fast for mortals when they're happy. With us it was the same.It was a very different life. And a new century was beginning. what had once been a small godforsaken French colony was growing into a great port, giving us an endless train of magnificent strangers...All human life was here, for the taking. And we took, all three of us, in our different ways...I watched her grow yet stay the same, her doll-like face possessed of adult eyes, eerie, powerful, seductive...Claudia - don't -Claudia -We're immortal. You've always known that.You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.Come... I've something to show you...Though everything was changed, through the years had warped the contours of the streets, I found my way there, aware that I'd always known where it was and avoided it, not wanting to pass the doorway where I'd first heard Claudia cry.I heard you crying. You were there in a room with your mother. You were hugging her for warmth, crying pitifully as you had been for days. Because your mother was dead...I opened the shutters... I came into the room... I felt pity for you. Pity, but something else.And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.I took your life. He gave you another one.How could I not? She had to know.Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...I walked all night. I walked as I walked years before when my mind swam with guilt at the thought of killing. I found myself at the Cathedral.I thought of all the things I had done and couldn't undo. And I longed for one second's peace...I had no fear. If anything I longed for something to happen, for the stones to tremble as I entered the foyer.I almost genuflected from old habit. I almost prayed.And then it struck me.What if the statues gave an image to nothing? What if I was the supernatural in this cathedral? The only immortal under this roof. And I felt nothing but loneliness. Loneliness to the point of madness.It's too late, too late -Bless me father for I have sinned so often and so long, I don't know how to change nor beg for forgiveness.Murders, father, death after death. The woman who died two nights ago in Jackson Square, I killed her. And thousands of others before her. I have walked the streets of New Orleans like the Grim reaper. And fed on human life for my own. I am a vampire, father, and have turned the one I love most of all into on too -Then there is no mercy.You talk of sacrilege. Why if God exists does he suffer me to exist?Why does he suffer me to live?He'll never let us go.So we made plans. She was convinced there were others of our kind in Europe, that they would have the answers Lestat couldn't provide. Lestat whom she now hated, who she thought she could be free of. I doubted, but then she had a surprise in store...Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!What have you done, Claudia -Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.He's dead, Claudia, dead.Don't mock, Claudia...And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.And if we find the one who made him? Do we tell him we destroyed his own creation? The vampire Lestat?Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.I can't. Go away from me.Claudia - You're crying -And you never cried -Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -I love you Claudia. Always. And we are free now, Claudia. No Lestat. Just the two of us, beginning the great adventure of our lives.The birds. We forgot about the birds. There's nothing for it but to let them go.The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -It can't be -Stay back - for the love of God... or I'll burn you alive...Not yet. Holding her tightly, Louis runs.Though the fire seemed to spread through the quartier, I stood on that deck until dawn, fearful he would come out again of the very river like some monster to destroy us both. And all the while I thought, Lestat, we deserve your vengeance. You gave me the dark gift. And I delivered you into the hands of death for the second time.He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.Though the ship was blessedly free of rats, a strange plague nonetheless struck its passengers.Claudia and I alone seemed immune. We kept to ourselves, pondering the mystery of Lestat and the greater mystery of each other.We reached the Mediterranean. I wanted those waters to be blue. They were black, nighttime waters and how I suffered then, straining to remember the color that a young man's senses had taken for granted, that my memory had let slip away for eternity. It was black off the coast of Italy, black off the coast of Greece, Europe itself was black.We saw the Acropolis by moonlight, shades of grey and silver. And I longed for the brilliant white of those marbles in the hot sun of Homer...We docked at Varna and searched the rural countryside of the Carpathians, for what she liked to term \"our kind\"...The quest for these Old World vampires filled me with bitterness. We searched village after village, ruin after ruin and I was glad when always we found nothing. For what could the damned really have to say to the damned?Peasant rumors, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...I think the very name of Paris brought a rush of pleasure to me that was extraordinary. I was a Creole, after all and Paris was the mother of New Orleans, a universe whole and entire unto herself...We were alive again. We were in love and so euphoric was I that I yielded to her every desire...Still my beautiful child.Yes...Yes.It was something hurries...and seldom savored... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.Claudia, you torture yourself.You are more beautiful than any of them.You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this -You know her?Come, Claudia...For a time we had been almost human, in the sensual whirl of what Paris had to offer. But the human delights of that city only served to remind her of the ageless child she had become. I felt her pain as I walked until I become aware that I was being followed.Claudia!So it was when I had given up the search for vampires that a vampire found me...You mean me harm?Trickster. Buffoon!I've searched the world for an immortal and this is what I find?Remember what I've told you. They'll have different powers. They'll read your thoughts if you allow it.Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.It's a vampire. It's the one I saw in Rue St Jacques.They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.This is no performance.This is monstrous!I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!We've been searching for you for a very long time...Monstrous.Your lips, they didn't move.We had feared we were the only ones...Are you the leader of this group?So you have the answers...What are we?Who made us what we are?But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...You mean we are not children of Satan?Then there is nothing.Then God does not exist...And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.He knew nothing. He just didn't care.The place was dark as we left, a darkness that confounded even Claudia. And as we blundered through it, again came the thought: I have wronged Lestat, I have hated him for the wrong reasons.You read my thoughts?A name I don't want to say again.What danger?Do you think I would let them harm you?Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.Never.That's not so.So you felt it too!He can protect us, Claudia.Listen to me.Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.No, my beloved, my child.I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.But why?Then blame the one who made her...We want no quarrel with him.Then I leave too.You said there were none.We can do that?That's what the one who made me said.He? Don't you see? I'm not the spirit of any age! I'm at odds with everything and always have been! I'm not even sure what I am!And the vampires of the Theatre?Yes... My God...Lestat! You knew Lestat!I felt a kind of peace at last. I had found the teacher which Lestat could never, I knew now, have been. I knew knowledge would never be withheld by Armand. It would pass through him as through a pane of glass. And I knew Claudia must leave me...You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!Yes...You promise to care for her then?And you know what you ask for?What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?And the child who did die?Look at the gaslight. Don't take your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.It's only mortal death.Bear me no ill will, my love. We are now even.What died tonight inside that room was not that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps years. What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human.Armand! Get me Armand! he wouldn't countenance this -You are alive, Lestat! It can't be murder! Tell them how you treated us...Are you mad???You let her go, Lestat - you let her free - and I'll come back with you -They've fooled you, Lestat! You must reach Armand! Armand has the power!Claudia!!!Where is she? Where's Claudia?Not without Claudia. Where is she?You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.CLAUDIA!!!I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.You let them do it.You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.I understand you only too well. You let them do it, as I let Lestat turn a child into a demon. As I let her rip Lestat's heart to pieces! Well I am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it. Your melancholy spirit of this century! I know what I must do. And I warn you - you saved me tonight, so I return the favor - do not go near your cell in the Theatre Des Vampires again.You didn't even warm them, did you?And yet you knew what I would do.You were their leader. They trusted you.What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?We left Paris shortly after. For years we wandered. Greece, Egypt, all the ancient lands. Then, out of curiosity, perhaps, boredom, who knows what, I took him home, to my America...And there, a technological wonder allowed me see sunrise, for the first time in two hundred years...And what sunrises! Seen as the human eye could never see them. We would sit in the dark, night after night among nameless humans, entranced with the miracle of light. Silver at first, then as the years progressed in tones of purple, red and my long-lost blue...And in time parted. We had become so alike, we both wanted the certainties of loneliness once more.I had returned to new Orleans. As soon as I smelt the air, I knew I was home. There was sadness there, rich, almost sweet, like the fragrance of jasmine. I walked the streets, savoring it like a long lost perfume...And then on Prytania Street, only blocks from the Lafayette cemetery I caught the scent of death and it wasn't coming from the graves...The scent grew stronger as I walked. Old death. A scent too faint for mortals to detect.They were like the doomed princess caught in the thorny vines of Sleeping Beauty's castle. I knew what it meant. A vampire had lured them here, but had been to weak to get rid of them.It spelt weakness, madness, the behavior of a dying animal that pollutes its own lair.He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.Don't try to speak... it's alright...That's all past, Lestat.Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.It's only a siren...And they frighten you?It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...I have to go now Lestat...Yes. I remember...I tried...You have it...Yes, Lestat...And my story ends there. But in fact it ended a long time ago, with Claudia's ashes in that theatre. My love died with her. I never really changed after that. What became of Lestat I have no idea. I go on, night after night. I feed on those who cross my path. But all my passion went with her yellow hair. I ma a spirit with preternatural flesh. Detached. unchangeable. Empty.But it has. There is no more to tell.It's over, I'm telling you...Do what you want with it. Learn what you can. Give the story to others.Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?Don't say anymore. The reels are still turning. I have but one chance to show you the meaning of what I've said.You like it? You like being food for the immortals? You like dying? Is it beautiful? Is it intense?Thank God.1791. That's when it happened. I was twenty-four. Younger then you are now.My invitation was open to anyone. Sailors, whores, thieves.

{"raw_line": "They would have killed you -You want death? Is it death you want?You still want death? Or have you tasted it enough?And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?You're not afraid of anything, are you?Are you going to put that through me too? Ruin my beautiful clothes?Were all last night's promises for nothing?I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?The wine has no taste. The food sickens you. There seems no reason for any of it, does there? But what if I could give it back to you? Pluck out the pain and give you another life? And it would be for all time? And sickness and death could never touch you again?Vampires, that's what we are. Creatures of darkness, only we see it that darkness more clearly than any mortal has ever seen...Wouldn't it be sweet to bid pain goodbye? To wave away anguish and grief? To embrace the peace of the unending night?They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?Vampires. We thrive on blood.Tomorrow night. You must prove yourself. I will give you the choice I never had.The sun's coming up. Watch it carefully. If you come with me tomorrow, you'll never see it again.Your grief has unhinged you. You've let your estate rot.You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.Call him.Why the bloody whip, Carlos?Let's call that a start.You've just done it -Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive.You really want to be with them?You asked for death. I didn't promise it -It's not your wife and child my friend. It's death. Just that simple. Think and choose. It happens to everyone. Except us.We shall be this way always, my friend. Young as we are now. I'm lonely for a companion, lonely for your strength. But I'm not that lonely. Do you want to come or not?Did I hear a yes?I've drained you to the point of death. If you drink from me you live for ever. If I leave you here you die.You're sure?Stop staring at my buttons. Didn't I tell you it was going to be fun?You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.It happens to us all.Come, you're going to feed now.That doesn't matter anymore, Louis. You'll see. Come...They're all beautiful now. Men, women, the old, the young...simply because they are alive. -Take him.Forget the crucifix. Take him.Resist no more Louis. Feed...You have fed. You were made for this...You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven.Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now. I can feel the sun approaching.You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too.Don't be afraid. In moments you'll be sleeping as soundly as you ever slept. And when you awake I'll be waiting for you, and so will all the world.Someday I'll tell you. We have a lot of time to talk to each other. You might say... we have all the time we shall ever need.Your wealth, dear Louis, is inestimable. Your income from cotton alone will keep us in comfort for a century.You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.Au contraire, my dear. He could eat a horse...Can't you pretend, you fool? Don't give the game away. We're lucky to have such a home.Pretend to drink, at least.Such fine crystal shouldn't go to waste...I know. It gets cold so fast.I wouldn't call it living. I'd call it surviving. A useful trick if you're caught for a month on a ship at sea.There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...Yes. And I'm bored with this prattle -Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!You think so, cherie? But what if I'd rather taste your lips?Let's get out of here!Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.Read her thoughts.The dark gift is different for each of us. But one thing is true of everyone. We grow stronger as we go along.Take my word for it. She blamed a slave for his murder. And do you know what they did to him?The evildoers are easier. And they taste better...You whining coward of a vampire who prowls the night killing rats and poodles. You could have finished us both!I don't know any hell -What strength, my friend, what strength. I remember why I chose you now.But you can't kill me, Louis. Nor I you.Feed on what you want, mon cherie. Rats, chickens, doves, goats. I'll leave you to it and watch you come round. Just remember, life without me would be even more unbearable...Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.As did the one who made me.I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?Why? Why should I know these things? Do you know them?That noise! It's driving me mad! We've been in the country for weeks, with nothing but that noise!!!Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendor!Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know.You'll soon run out of chickens, Louis...You fool, what have you done?Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?Not always...Your friend has no head for wine.Do you think so?Ah, but the price is pretty high. Your sweet friend - I exhausted her.What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?What do you imagine you are Louis?Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God.Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.I know. Let her alone.You think you can be human. You think you can go back. But you can't. You live off the blood of rats now Louis. How human is that?Lie still, love...You're tired love, you want to sleep.I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!Of course it's a coffin. You're dead, love.You finish her - if you feel so much -But it's too late, love. Look at your wrist, you breast.Unless I make her one of us...THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.Ah, my philosopher, my martyr. \"Never take a human life\". Well you must admit it is funny. Or is it merely touching? I'm not sure.Let's make some party of it, shall we? Maybe there's some life in the old lady yet?Come back, Louis, you are what you are. The plague would have got her within hours anyway. Merciful Death how you love your precious guilt.All I need to find you Louis is follow the corpses of rats.Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.That and more.Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child.She's here, your wounded one.You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.That's it dear. More. You must drink it to get well.Stop, that's enough. No more.Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again.Gently, cherie. They are so innocent. They must not be made to suffer.That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.Mamma's gone to Heaven, cherie, like that sweet lady over there. They all go to Heaven. And you did very well, cherie. Not a drop spilt. Very good! You're going to be our child now.Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.One happy family.Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...Claudia, Claudia! Didn't I tell you, never in the house!Well, I thought you could use another.What night? What do you mean?I didn't realize.Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.But you're the fairest by far.What you are? You would be something other than you are?It will grow back again!Stop her Louis!And why should I tell you? It's in my power.Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.Not you my dear.What plans?Stop pestering me then!Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?We forgive each other then?Absinthe? You gave them absinthe?Laudanum!Ah Louis, Louis, she killed them... and let me drink...Louis, put me in my coffin...Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift - help me -WHERE IS SHE? WHERE IS THAT ACCURSED CHILD?GIVE ME HER LOUIS!!Louis...No, the child. The child was the one...No... You come back to me Louis...Only the girl - it was the girl -You promised me - I could take him back to New Orleans - Louis - there's something I must tell you - about that night - that night I met you -He's coming home with me - you promised -You'll come home with me Louis? For a little while... until I am myself again.I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat.You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.You'll come back, Louis... take me out... little by little... and maybe I'll be myself again...Dear Louis... will I ever forget?", "clean_line": "killed want death death
