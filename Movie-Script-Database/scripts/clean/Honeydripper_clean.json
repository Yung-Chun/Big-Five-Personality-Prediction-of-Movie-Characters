{"Honeydripper": {"TY": {"raw_line": "You take it for a while.Yeah. And all them people over there buying drinks and throwing their money after them dice and whatnot. Lucky we got none a that here.Sounds fine. Always has.Not a crowd at all. Just some stiffs who want to drink theirself to sleep without the music wakin em up.Singin is one thing, Slick. Whether people want to look at you while you do it is another.Sounds like it.Thanks, China Doll.Don't dog me about that, baby. Not tonight.She got to help out.Not much chance of that in here. Harvest hands all been crowdin into Toussaint's place. The young ones.They stick their noses in here, get one little sniff of the music, and they gone.Aint no sin happenin here tonight, baby, and there sure as hell aint no wages. Your God wants to chastise some sinners He best move on over to Toussaint's, got a whole barroom crowded with em.How that tent meeting went tonight?I thought she found Him last year when they come through.The Spirit didn't move you, though?Toussaint cut his credit off. Either he gets it here--or he drinks that paint-peeler Willie Pettigrew cooks up back in the swamp.Least he won't go blind first.Say one for me too, baby.Don't need to come in if you don't want to.I've made other arrangements.Try something new in here.Yeah. Put the box on.China Doll?No you don't. They turned my juice off last month- don't want them sniffin around that splice job Maceo done.Don't worry folks, bar's still open.Evenin, Sheriff.Looks like it.We just about to close up here.Not tonight. Went to the revival tent.Lot's of fighting in there.Just people talkin.I owe the chicken man, I owe the ice man, I owe the liquor man-Yeah, that's a big relief.What you think?He's playing here Saturday night. Figured I'd wait till Bertha Mae was gone to put this up.You know the Tomcat Club in Texarkana?Just went out of business.And since Sam is giggin his way over to Tulsa, that means he got the date open-I'm having one now.You just worry about gettin these hung up everywhere in the county tomorrow. Payday come Saturday, he gonna draw alla them cotton pickers and soldiers boys in here, get us back in the black.They gonna take me down, it won't be without a fight.What's the matter?Thought you used to work for the power company.Guitar Sam aint gonna play by no candlelight.You must of burnt your porky ass with that lectricity.Where's your mama?Darlin, that's not the kind of thing a man cares about from a woman.You didn't do no such thing. It just decided to come back on.Just like it decided to switch off last night. You not even in the conversation.Nadine look like she can take care of those, too-Man was dog drunk-Owwww!You got to admit it, though- woman is an artist with that Singer machine.We aint hirin.Already got me a professional.That so surprising?You know Shack?When's the last time you ate solid food, young man?Take him back and fix him somethin, China Doll. Standin there all hungry-eyed, puts me off my breakfast.Look like he got cooties, too. Straw in them boxcars is full of em.I was out there ridin them rails between the wars. Seem like half the country headin west rolled past the other half comin back east. Every one of us scrapin for the next meal-I help you gentlemen?This is my place.Name's Tyrone- call me Pinetop Purvis.He's gonna get his-After this weekend-Lucky give me two weeks-He can't do that.And I throw in a twenny-five cent tip for his messenger boy.In the meantime, we not open yet. Which means yall are trespassin.We cleared over two hundred that one weekend-And we didn't have no Louisiana guitar wizard playin neither.That's what they say.I already sent fifty to his manager.Another hundred.I figure we charge folks two dollars to get in, then drinks-Y'all a day late.Old Man Toussaint gonna chew you out.My credit no good anymore?Whoah, whoah- what's your hurry?Well this is like a special case, see- we got the harvest coming in, soldiers at the base gonna be let out on leave- Saturday night. Aint enough hootch in this truck to satisfy what we gonna sell-You can come by Monday, get paid and take back every damn drop I aint sold! We got Guitar Sam lined up, you know what that means?!I'll pay you extra- penny a bottle on the beer and a nickel on the whiskey!What if I throw in five dollars up front, just for you fellas- ?Come on, man, everybody give credit, that's the American way!With that sheriff sniffin around every night? Land my black ass in jail for good.That would be me.I trust they got my check all right?Pull it around to the back- we'll help you unload.-it's an affliction.Come on, China Doll. Got some bidness in town you gonna help me with.And you, young man, want to point yourself west down that highway. Bout three miles you see a mess of people working in the fields- it's harvest time. If you can stoop and pull, they got a job for you.And wash up them dishes before you go.What I need is for you to go get friendly with Luther, then I just happen in-Mr. Skinner don't want nothin from colored folks but they buy his goods and shine his shoes. You go on ahead, now-I hate that damn song.Just tryin to hold it together.Don't you be studyin her.Where you hear that?Well this time the breeze know what it's blowin about.Be careful yourself.Here it comes--the gospel accordin to A. Phillip Randolph.Got my nose above the waterline.I carried a rifle in the Great War, Shack. Boys get in the middle of this Korea mess they aint gonna thank you for your efforts.Black folks shooting yellow folks to keep the white folks happy?You go ahead and move right on, Shack. Then come back and tell the rest of us how it is.Of course you would. While you at it, remind him how one of the reasons colored folks come in here is to get the lowdown on what's happening in--Maceo, go on with the man and he show you where you can put em up. Come on, darlin, we got more stops to make-You got that boy eatin out of your hand.Well I hope you got a little that sugar left, cause we got to spread some on Miss Bertha Mae Spivey-Imonna ask her for money. Word is she got a whole pile of it squirreled away.Come on, girl, we in a rush here-I'm sorry, baby. You catch your breath.Gonna make her a partner.In the Honeydripper.That don't matter. Imonna make her a proprietor.Proprietress. She got to like the sound of that.We make like we just come by to see how she's keepin, and then I'll kind of mention how I been thinking of bringing her on as a partner-Oh.When she gonna be back?Aw, damn.China Doll, you go find your Mama. She know how to fix up the body.And stop by Beauchamp's and tell em they got a customer.Folks who wouldn't have nothin to do with her when she was alive.Slick gonna have to find him a new ride.That's how the man gets over, is all, sugarin up to some woman got a job or a bankroll-Just how it is out in the world, baby- man got to walk through the gates of Hell to get a piece of cheese.You're not so young any more, lose hold of what little you got-In this town? Like what?\"Watch yo feet, Mr. Mayor, I done just mopped the flo! \"Isn't even as much as what you make polishin that white lady's silver. I know.You didn't have to.Your soul not the one needs savin, baby.That's right.What you know about anything?Supposed to be.Sam- Guitar Sam-- don't know his birth name-Hospital?Wish they'd made you dumb instead of blind.Well I had my fun if I Don't get well no more Well I had my fun if I Don't get well no more My head is spinnin And I'm goin down slow-Don't make any difference now.Somebody we could find?There must have been a first one.Back slavery days, they had the ones that worked in the big house. Might not of had shoes always, but their pants didn't have no holes and they didn't pick no cotton.That's how they called em. They must of had all their African kinda instruments- drums, shakers, some kind of banjo thing- but the piano-The piano was just sittin there in the white folks' big room, all polished up-- and I figure this one boy, he goes past fifteen, twenty times a day, running the corner of his eye over it. And he's there when they play, the masters, doin all their minuets and whatever--him standing there with a tray of white people food pretendin not to have a thought in his head, might be only some dust hangin in the air for all they know- but he's watchin the fingers, see, watchin them keys work. This old boy, the first one, he can play alla them Africa kinda instruments, he can play mud if you give him the key and the tempo, he's got music in his head, in his heart, in every damn piece of him there's music.And one day the masters is away, huntin foxes or some rich white people thing they get up to, and he's alone in the room with that piano and he comes over and sits down on the bench--and he spreads his fingers out the way he seen the minuet player do- and he-And he thinks- `Lord help me, I could do some damage with this.'Mace, Imonna lose my club.I got no more cards to play-I aint kissin up to no cokey-nose, conk-headed-What the hell that sposed to be?A guitar has got a hole in it, that's where the sound comes from. That boy must be bout three bricks shy of a load upstairs.Arrested who?Who's Sonny?Sonny that got a screw loose is why they arrested him. Maceo, make a noise on that-I plug a chunk of stove wood into the wall I get more music out of it than that mess gonna make.Sonny didn't do nothin but feed bedbugs in anybody's Army, and some of em crawled in his head. Surprised if that boy got the wit to pick cotton. Judge Gatlin bought himself a droolin idiot. What you want to amplify a damn guitar for anyway?Less you gonna sit over on your chair and play them little Charley Christian kind of riffs-Sit over there and be all clean and polite. Guitar hasn't been up front since them old piss and moan blues shouters, sit their blind asses on the corner hollerin for pennies-I hope he plugs it in the wrong socket some night, lectrocutes his sorry no-show ass!Now if he did show up here-- and our power was to go out again while he was playing-So he come out and plugs his ax in-Clothes, right-You remember that night the lights went out in the Esquire Club in Mobile?They didn't hold it against Reggie Porter, did they?Didn't hold it against him, didn't expect no money back for the show-And nobody suspected it might be Reggie Porter hisself that pulled them lights, did they?China Doll, you mind the place while we're gone! Come on, man, we got work to do.I promise the people Guitar Sam, they gonna get Guitar Sam!Got a job for him.Passing well, yeah-Name is Sonny-Judge Gatlin payin three a day for prison labor.Which might be- ?Well, I was counting on more of a one-time deal- if I could just rent him out for the weekend-I pay you Sunday morning?I don't have it now.It's not a favor if I got to pay-You'll get the fifty.Delilah-She be happy to fix you whatever you want.Different people got different kinds of talents.You got any ideas about turning rabbit on me, you best get rid of em now.Till Monday.You like draggin that cotton sack?Then don't ask questions.You got to do somethin with this boy's head, darlin. They might not know what the real Sam look like, but it aint this.You gone stand up there with that contraption you got an play Guitar Sam numbers.We could get the audience to close theirs we be better off.Let's hit it.I didn't know you was givin lessons.You interested in a playin job?Got to dress sharp.Sudden loss of power. Lights out.Eight o'clock. This aint colored people time and it sure aint New Awlins time. I mean eight o'clock on the money.That's a deal then.Nothin fancy, he just got to keep time-People call me Ty or they call me Pinetop. Mr. Pinetop to you.Right.That's fine.I was known, but I was never what you call famous.Down in Mobile there was an old cathouse professor name of Joe Dudlow, had had a stroke on one side, curled him all up- but he kept on pluggin. I used to come out and play his left hand for him.Thirteen, fourteen. This one night it was goin hot and heavy and Joe just passed, right there at the piano, in the middle of Black Bottom Stomp. They propped him up at the bar, stuck a drink in his hand, and told me to keep poundin them ivories. There was a meanness hanging over them juke joints, there was murder in the air. You stopped playin for a minute, it come down like a flock of crows.Big band days, on the road. If a railroad train run through it, we played it.Big tall light-skin fella out of Carolina, said he's part Cherokee. Couldn't play nothin, but he waved his little stick and had this long greasy hair he throw around like Cab Calloway.Piano man, arranger, you name it.I don't know about first class, but we seen the country.Got tired of carrying another man's water. Didn't want to die in no colored hotel some night in Who-Knows-Where Arkansas.Met Delilah and wanted something of my own.No- I don't spose you will.Imonna put that back and double-I had to send off the advance pay or the man don't come and play-China Doll don't need any school, baby, she could walk into one of them shops right this minute and get a job!The world starts throwin me breaks, woman, maybe I'll catch religion and walk the straight and narrow like them Bible thumpers you sit up with, but till that day, I-How we doing?What if I lost her?This aint gonna work, is it?See if you can push another round of drinks while I stall em.You be on those wires. Give him three bars and then you pull it.Just get the liquor movin, Mace, and keep that money where you can run with it.Damn-Honey, I want you to get right by that front door and take over collectin the cover charge. And if anything should happen- like go wrong or something- you just step out and walk away from the club, hear?Oh- our Guitar Sam here gets them soldier boys jumping it could get a little rough- just be on your toes, that's all.China Doll-You know there aint a thing in this world I wouldn't do for you. Even if I mess up sometimes, you know that, right?You go on, now.Well, you look like something might of come outa New Orleans-My what?You don't think I know that?Didn't think we'd be seeing you so soon!Yeah, well we got ourselves this special attraction, see, and-Huh?Right-See, the thing is-The situation we got, Sheriff, what with this special guest come up from Louisiana- what it means is- uhm-Maybe if you were to come back in-Might want to wait over there, Sheriff. Don't want to scare off the customers-Oh Lord-So here's what you all been waitin for, people, the noted performer and recordin star--direct from New Orleans, Louisiana--Guitar Sam!!!!I went to a party With a bobby sox I started swingin All she would do was rockWell- he'd have to take it up with my bidness partner.Yeah, and he's twice as mean as he is ugly.Yall in my house, here, gentlemen. Don't have no fightin, don't have no killin, don't have none of that dismal nonsense in my house. Understand? What's your name son?And you?Well, gentlemen, this is the night there won't be no pitiful song written bout you two killin each other. Don't nothin rhyme with `Moncrief' anyhow.These young men seem to brought something in for our collection.Now yours.Yall still need to mess with each other, you go outside and do it.This world is full of people got no use for us, like to see us in the grave.

Come to listen to that box of his.Don't see why we don't just turn our box on and let folks feed it nickels like they do.But didn't nobody come to listen to her, Slick.Like the man say, you can't argue with failure.Never mind him, he just a drunk-You know Tyrone don't allow no scufflin here, Slick.You gonna drink, Stokely, or you gonna lay out back recoverin from that busted head you about to get?Likewise, Miss Nadine. What can I do for you?What would you like to drink?I put the box on now, Ty?Imonna crank it up some, see if we can draw a little life in here-Damn.Must be a short circuit in the juke here-Imonna have to go out back, wiggle some things around.Never been a killin in here. Them youngbloods know better-Speakin for yourself.It's just a weekday night-Least you don't owe the electric company.You thinkin bout closing down?Biggest act in New Orleans, got him a hit on the radio-Here? You mean like in this room here?Big Jim Jamison's place-Damn-But you aint never had a guitar pl-What you gonna pay the man with?Guitar Sam at the Honeydripper. Man, this joint is going to jump!Damn!I got a shock.I drove a supply truck.I smell bacon.That is a sweet woman you got.You mean Nadine?She seems like the kind could smother a man-Hey, I fixed it!Decided.That woman scares me. Last ole boy that give her a tumble, Nappy Carpenter? MACEO She cook for him, fixed him up all kinds of nice new clothes, kept him in gin and poker chips-Well, come four, five months, a man starts to- sorry, China Doll, but this just the way it is- a man gots needs.You eat chicken every morning, noon and night for five months, you get a taste for some different kind of meat, right? Maybe I shouldn't be-Well, Nappy goes out and has him a- a porkchop or two, let's say- and he comes back from Toussaint's one night feeling no pain, smelling like- like porkchops- the way a man will- and he falls out on Nadine's couch and commences to snore. Wake up the next mornin, finds she had took all his clothes off without him knowin it-Miss Nadine come in with a skillet in her hand, hot grits bubbling in it, says \"Baby, I got your breakfast.\" \"Not this morning, Nadine,\" he says, sittin up, \"don't think I could eat a thing.\" \"Well then,\" she says, \"we can't let this go to waste, can we?\" and she dump that whole hot bubblin mess right in the man's lap.Then she got busy with that hot iron on his head. Screams didn't bring the neighbors in, she would of killed that man.Must of come in on the northbound last night.Never cared to travel that way.What if we got our payment for him Monday?We can do that-Couple years back-Yeah, they say he draws em like flies.They say first thing he does is go to the man that owns the joint, sticks out his hand and wants that cash money put in it.How much you payin him all out?We'd have to clear three hundred-What I'm sayin is, less he sees the green up front the man won't get off the train.What's that now?Bout time you fellas run by. We just about dry here.Tyrone! Whiskey wagon come by!Maybe we could buy some busthead from Willie Pettigrew.Then what we gonna do?That's-Man, this better be some Saturday night.Lovely ladies out to make a purchase-The very one.Fine lookin man. Real lady killer from what I hear. Got that New Orleans style to him.Oh, we'll be gettin some of those when he comes in on the train. The main thing is, the man is electrified- and you know what that means.Saturday night, fellas! Every fine- looking colored woman in the county gonna be there- don't want to miss it!Afternoon, sir. Nice lookin bunch of soldiers.Excuse me, folks-Yall heard about the show we puttin on at the Honeydripper Saturday night?Man don't take care of hisself- out drinkin and jazzin the women every night-Got so bad, I heard there was some ole boy goes around pretendin to be Guitar Sam, fill out the gigs he misses. Does pretty well for hisself, what I hear-Hell, I don't know. Just a story I heard.First what?House niggers.Didn't bring no piano over on them ships from Africa.Down to the bones--Watch out now-Would have liked to been there. I mean to hear the cat play, not none of the rest of it.Old Man Toussaint finds out you stole his liquor, you like to lose more than that-Maybe if you was to go down, see Lucky Hardaway in person-Some kind of guitar.It's electric-Naw, man, it don't work unless it's hooked up to the juice, see? You got the juice, you don't need the hollow inside the box, the music just runs straight from the strings through this wire and comes out--your amplifier. Which is what this thing must be.A sideman-Old time music-They hung colored boys for less than that, darlin. Least on the work gang they feed em, keep their strength up.You know, Guitar Sam plays him an electric, but I don't think it's this no-hole kind of deal.I think I fixed it good this time, Ty.He come out lookin good, from what I hear. All kind of spangly pants and jacket, got his name spelled out on the back-Hair all slick and shiny, flash some gold teeth at them gals, got his sax man behind him, maybe a piano, harmonica, drums-And somebody took off with the gate? Stole the whole damn register off the counter-Naw- it was his place that got robbed.They all too busy diving on the pot of that tonk game got interrupted-Aw, no, Ty, we can't-This size, right, but it's got to shine.Tonight.It's got to happen.Yeah, I spose you do-Uhm- you come by the club tonight, we havin a special show. Tell em at the door you my guest-Wouldn't hurt you to skip a few meals.Boy's gonna need time to try that jacket on- see how it feels. Later, Nadine-Ty-I tracked Mr. Trenier down-Mr. Time Trenier- that's a name to be reckoned with.Story goes that you used to play with Buddy Bolden.And King Oliver-It's uhm- backin up a man on the electric guitar?It aint like a all-night thing- you just start out and there's gonna be a accident-You know any drummers?Natives gettin restless.We gonna be full up. But the food- Delilah comin in?She won't let you down, Ty-We just got to play it out and see-Then you gonna bring him out?I got a baseball bat under the counter, but you out here all alone-Ty!We got a situation out there-Got the law in the house.Oh my soul.I believe we do.Hundred forty-two, forty-three, forty-four, five, six, seven, eight, nine- hundred fifty.
