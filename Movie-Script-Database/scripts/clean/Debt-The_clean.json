So you're the famous author I've heard so much about?Rachel.Now you're the expert, maybe you could tell me something. Who's this handsome devil on the cover?It went well?That's good. Good, good. That's very good.We're going to David's apartment.I keep track of people Rachel. It's my job. I know he came to see you yesterday.A little of both. What did he want?What did he tell you?My car's waiting outside. It can take you to the airport.You're in my room.I'm moving in with him. You're at the end there.What do you think of your new wife?Pretty.You didn't notice.You know what I've noticed? You don't notice women. I've noticed that. How long have I known you?Two years. All the places we've been to. You don't look at women. Before I get into that bed, is there anything you have to tell me?Well, well...I think he just noticed.Yes?Now an attack from behind.Where have you come from?Really? Whereabouts?What were you doing there?He does look like a chemist.She's not going to fucking break, David. Move.What were you doing before this? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 22.And what did you do in Liaison?So, first time in the field. Rachel feels herself blush a little angrily. Stephan grabs her from behind and Rachel executes a perfect break, twisting Stephen's arm. Stephan winces, surprised.Good. That's...good.So. Everything...?Bitte sehr.One, two, three, four, five, six...Usually.The last two carriages will be around......here. And they will be empty. Once that train has stopped, the guards won't be able to see this fence. And on the other side of the fence is......a postal depot.The vans come and go all day long.That's the wrapping. Now all we need is the present. Rachel realises both men are looking at her.Nice.Here you are, Mossad agent, all those years of training, the highest levels of marksmanship and krav magah, first big mission...sewing.I never argue with an armed woman.Shit.We're too late for all of those.What are you pursuing Rachel? Rachel thinks about it, shrugs.Youth...Oh yes. We believe in goals in my family. We're very driven men. My father was Director of Collections by the time he was fifty. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 33.Director of Collections by forty.Forget about it.I've spent two years with him, and I don't know him. Nobody knows him. He's alone.All of them.Maybe it's not always a blessing to survive.Vielen dank!Identity is confirmed. We have a green light.It's whiskey.You're so beautiful...We need to take him to the hospital. He and David open up the stretcher and transfer Vogel to it with some efficiency.He's going to be alright.I know, I know.One, two, three, four, five, six...Twenty, twenty one, twenty two...We have to go!We can make it. Help me with him...We're going! Now! FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 52.Down!Is he dead? Is he dead?The Guard! The one who saw your face! Is he dead?How did he come round? How the fuck did he come round? You gave him the full injection?Did you give him the...Jesus Christ!We could have gone!And you're compromised. You don't leave the fucking house.You can't talk to him.You can't listen to him.I'm not angry -- I'm just telling you - we don't talk to him. We don't listen to him. He isn't there. He isn't a human being. He...We have a date. Ten days time. The Americans are going to help.Fuck!It's not happening.The Americans have pulled out. Has he been fed?Did you feed him?I said has he...?I'm talking to her! Supposedly it's her shift now, but instead of doing what she's supposed to be doing she's out here with you! Now answer the fucking question: Did you feed him?There's no plan. There's no fucking plan. They said the operation is being \"re- evaluated.\"You know what that means? They're going to cut us loose.It's a fucking mess and they're backing away from it quickly as they can.It's happening. I can feel it.Yes they can! Because we fucked it all up! We fucked it all up and now we're on our own!If it's them, he dies.Move.He's not getting away from me.I decide what the mission is! If I say he dies, he dies.Get out of the way!Rachel. Rachel!It's your shift.I was sick of seeing his face. Go back in.You don't give orders David. It's your shift now so you can go back in there...Don't be stupid.Out. We're going out. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 75.Are you going to be alright?Nothing. Not a trace. Nothing at all. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 78.He might go to the house, might try and get a message to the wife...So we what? We...are you going to make the phone call? Are you going to tell them how he got a fucking piece of broken bowl? Wonderful. But don't try and take me down with you. I've done nothing wrong. Remember that!This can't happen! This is never going to go away.No-one's ever going to find him again.What if he didn't escape? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 79.Only four people know what happened in this room. Us, and him. And he's not talking. No one will ever hear from him again.Nobody needs to know what happened here.That's the truth. But that doesn't have to be the truth we take home. The truth can be anything we want it to be. The truth is Vogel tried to escape, you struggled with him and got hurt. The truth is, seconds before he got away, Rachel got the gun and shot him. The truth is we got rid of him.... got rid of the body... got rid of every trace of the Surgeon of Birkenau.No, you know what? We have to. We have to! This is...this isn't about us. This is about Israel. This is a national humiliation! We can't be seen to fail. And in the end, Vogel rots away his life in some jungle, looking over his shoulder, waiting for the bullet...? Who's to say...?Maybe that's a worse fate. Maybe that's...The important thing is justice... justice is seen to be done! FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 80.He's right. It makes no difference. No difference. All we have to agree is that we never talk about this. No matter what happens, we never tell anyone. The truth stays in this room. Between us. Agreed? Rachel looks at David again, wanting some kind of sign.Agreed? Say it. I need to hear you say it!Say it. Say...Rachel? Say it. It's an oath. Say it.We don't know it's him.If you read it...This is a little internet story. ...\"a psychiatric patient claiming to be the Surgeon of Birkenau...\" Some crazy old man. No-one is paying this any attention. Yet.David comes back after all this time, I want to know why. I had his apartment searched. This was on his computer...He didn't say anything to you last night..?Rachel..?Because he couldn't handle it. I told him we had to deal with it and he couldn't handle it. He thought it was all going to come out and he panicked...I told him to find Vogel. I told him to finish it.FUCK DAVID! I don't want to hear about David! David took the coward's way out!There's a journalist.A Ukrainian. He's heard about it and he's going to interview Vogel. Then it all comes apart. We don't have the name of the hospital. You have to find out where he is.David's taken himself out of the equation. I can't do it. You're the only one left.We can't...You have to, Rachel. Because for thirty years you've been taking the credit for it. And there's Sarah. It's as if he's struck her. Beat.I thought I'd already been punished.I wasn't referring to the wheelchair.If I could go back, Rachel, I'd change it all. If I could give you back a chance to be happy, to be... FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 85.But there's one thing I would never change.My car's waiting outside. It can take you to the airport.Go down to her. Say goodbye to her.Fuck him.Fuck him.Hurry up. Rachel finishes her glass, starts to apply some eye makeup. She senses something and turns to find YOUNG SARAH watching her from the doorway. She stares back at her dully.It's outside Vinnycja. About a hundred and fifty miles south- west of you. What name is he going under?When is he supposed to interview him?This will be over soon. And when it is...Yes?A family matter... Would you give me a moment?You're sure?Thank God. Thank God. This is wonderful. This is...and you're okay? Rachel? You're alright, yes?Rachel?Well, thank God I was, but...About David?What?Truth is a luxury, Rachel. Some people have to put other things first - their country, their people...their children...Sarah's so proud of you, Rachel. You have to think about her.Of course you do.Rachel...?

What's so important? Tell me where we're going?David...?What's this? The jealous ex- husband or the intelligence officer?

We just moved here... A few months ago. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 26.Teatro Colon. He turns back to her, holding a swab, the warm smile.Next appointment is on Wednesday.Try this on.How does it feel?

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 87.Just a coffee.At that moment, I don't think I was thinking about myself at all. I was thinking about my mother.

You were wrong about him.He didn't kill himself because he was afraid the story would come out.When he came to see me, he was asking me for something.My permission. And I didn't give it.
