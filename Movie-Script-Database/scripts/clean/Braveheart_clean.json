The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?That is not possible.Hamilton, leave us.Leave us now.Let us talk plainly. You invade England.

No man has ever looked at me as you did.I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost?

Tell him to be sure the English see him ride away!For Scotland!You are Robert the Bruce.My father fought in support of yours.I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.LISTEN TO ME! Longshanks understands this! This!There is a difference between us. You think the people of this country exist to provide you with position. I think your position exists to provide the people with freedom. And I go to make sure they have it.And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage!

We will be more merciful than they have been. We will spare women, children, and priests. For all else, no mercy.Longshanks! I have come.Wife of Edward, the king's son?It's battle I want, not talk.I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.Longshanks did far worse, the last time he took a Scottish city.I am no bandit. And I do not lie.Or in French if you prefer that: Certainmous et ver! Ask your king to his face, and see if his eyes can convince you of the truth.A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.I've never told anyone. I don't know why I tell you -- except because you look... much like her. And someday you will be a queen, and you must open your eyes! Tell your king that William Wallace will not be ruled. Nor will any Scot, while I live.A thousand. You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.Peace?!With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!We won at Stirling and still you quibbled! We won at York and you would not support us! Then I said nothing! Now I say you are cowards!War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.And I will consult with mine.Remember when the English turned their hounds on us? Maybe we should introduce them to our dogs.Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.Stephen ready?Irish troops!It's only a faint to shield the crossbows!Now! Give 'em the dogs!Now! Charge! Charge them!Hamish! Ham --Get him away!A charge! Form up! Form up!You... were like my father...Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.Why did you?You have... you have a husband.I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.I rest.Aye. But it won't let me dream.You've all sworn to Longshanks.So let the council swear publicly.I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.No. One of us is enough.Treason. Against whom?Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king ---- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!I do not confess.I am so afraid... Give me strength.M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already.Your people are lucky to have a princess so kind that she can grieve at the death of a stranger.Every man dies. Not every man really lives.It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.That... will... clear your sinuses.FREEEEE-DOMMMMMM!", "clean_line": "home help help home way lord william wallace bandit hides face man horse horse horse today spare man yielded england tell scotland daughters sons tell scotland free hamish thank thinking longshanks sends northern army heavy cavalry armored horses shake ground ll ride right spears spears fourteen feet long stand man pope thank friend irishman answer yes fight kill english stop rest marion dreaming want wake want stay need love right hamish campbell divide run split matter follow scent scent ve tricked dogs scent scent given exactly english lord trust irishman nobles rally presenting battlefield thanks homage scotland army sons scotland william wallace yes heard kills men hundreds consume english fireballs eyes bolts lightning ass william wallace enemies away saw good nobles hanged wife william wallace army countrymen defiance tyranny come fight free men free men freedom fight yes fight die run live awhile dying bed years willing trade days day chance come young men tell enemies lives freedom bring spearmen set field offer king absolutely scotland terms lower flags march straight england stopping scottish home pass beg forgiveness years theft rape murder men shall live die today finished let leave commander cross bridge stand army head legs kiss ass ready exactly steady hold hold form english coward come tell mornay ride flank cross upstream wait tell sure english ride away scotland robert bruce father fought support invade england defeat english ground listen longshanks understands difference think people country exist provide position think position exists provide people freedom sure common man bleeds battlefield risk end dead question nobles mean noble title gives claim throne country men follow titles follow courage arm speaks louder tongue people know noble common respect lead freedom follow wait burn stop listen wish frighten goad attacking soon look away look behold enemy fight merciful spare women children priests mercy longshanks come wife edward king son battle want talk given god makes men york staging point invasion country royal cousin hanged scots women children city walls longshanks far worse time took scottish city bandit lie french prefer certainmous et ver ask king face eyes convince truth lordship gold judas slaves ways wife married secret share english lord killed pregnant ve told know tell look like someday queen open eyes tell king william wallace ruled scot live thousand guardian scotland tell face peace cavalry heavy like english light fast horsemen like nobles employ outmaneuver bowmen won stirling quibbled won york support said cowards war finds willing know won bring lost bring country need king need tell king man believes believe calculates numbers weighs strength heart strength know consult remember english turned hounds maybe introduce dogs mornay come bruce stephen ready irish troops faint shield crossbows em dogs charge charge hamish ham away charge form form like father thanks food drink bringing em meeting barn trap know aware husband love sake revenge rest aye won let dream ve sworn longshanks let council swear publicly meet way robert bruce puts hand bible swears loyalty scotland probably win know way want live want home children peace ve asked god things brought sword wills lay wants country ll ve lived dream dream freedom dreams marion gone killed knew live death welcome treason life swear allegiance king serve taken broken oath times commit treason subject confess afraid strength lady kindness visit stranger mercy country soldiers let rule swear dead people lucky princess kind grieve death stranger man dies man lives numb wits senseless wail longshanks broken clear sinuses freeeee dommmmmm"}}}
