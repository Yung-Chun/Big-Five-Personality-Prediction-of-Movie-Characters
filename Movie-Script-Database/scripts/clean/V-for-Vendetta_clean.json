{"V-for-Vendetta": {"EVEY": {"raw_line": "\"Remember, remember, the fifth of November, the gunpowder treason and plot. I know of now reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot.\"Those were almost the very first words he spoke to me and, in a way, that is where this story began, four hundred years ago, in a cellar beneath the Houses of Parliament.In 1605, Guy Fawkes attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament.He was caught in the cellars with enough gunpowder to level most of London.Sometimes I wonder where we would be if he hadn't failed. I wonder if it would have mattered.I suppose the answer is in the rhyme. More than the man, what we must remember is the plot itself.For in the plot we find more than just a man, we find the idea of that man, the spirit of that man, and that is what we must never forget.This, then, is the story of that idea, of that spirit that began with an anarchist's plot four hundred years ago.I was born near the end of the millennium, the year 1997. My father used to say that people were so afraid that the world was going to end that they were willing it to happen.I don't remember much of the century's turn. I don't remember the market crash or the plague or any of the Trafalgar riots.I've read about them since but I don't recall how any of them impacted my life except for the fear. They would hide it from me, like a secret between them.But I could feel it.Of the chaos that seemed to swallow the beginning of the 21st century, there is one thing I do remember.Very clearly, I can remember that sound.And I remember those boots, black leather that gleamed bright in the morning sun. I had never seen such boots. All moving in perfect unison.It must have seemed so easy to them. They offered such a simple deal; give up control and we will restore order.At first, the arrests were political. Dissidents. Radicals. Liberals.When my parents were younger, they had been activists. They had marched with Labor in the great train strike.I never saw them again. Overnight, my life, my entire world was erased.It was done so quickly and violently, so completely, that it began to seem that it had never even existed.The homosexuals were next. What God had started with AIDS had to be finished by man. It was God's work. That's what we were told.But once they were gone, there was someone else. Someone different.Someone dangerous.There were those who understood what was happening, who knew it was wrong but who kept silent.And in the vacuum of that silence, order was imposed.Order that was like those boots, order that required rigorous discipline. Order that is exactly the same, where each single step falls with every step. The order of the many shaped into one.Somehow in my heart, I knew it wouldn't last.What they thought they had crushed, the spirit they believed trampled and ground beneath the marching of their boots, rose up, rose as if from a four hundred year old grave, rose to remind us all that day.I don't know what brought us together that night. I had never been to that part of Westminster but ever since I've known him, I've stopped believing in coincidence.Excuse me? Uh... excuse me, Mister?Would you like... uh, would you like to sleep with me?I mean, for money.Oh god, I'm sorry.Yes, no, I mean for money. But I know what you want and I'll do it.Anything you want, mister. Please, I need the money. I know I'm young but I promise I know what I'm doing.Christ, you're a Fingerman.Oh god, please. It's my first time. Please don't hurt me.Oh no!Please, don't!Who -- Who are you?Evey.Why did you do that? Why did you... help me?For what?Music?Is that why you're wearing a mask?Uh... November fourth.I don't know.To your music?I can't hear anything.Oh my...It's beautiful...Wait. I've lost you.Oh...A jukebox? Where did you get it?Oh, it's beautiful. I've never heard anything like it.This place is amazing.Stay here... with you?I... I don't even know your name.V? V... I like that.V, v, v, v, v.Oh, V, you scared me.I was reading the inscription. What is it?Yes, I suppose you have. This place is the only universe I have right now.I don't know. I'm so grateful to you -- I just feel I should help you, you know, the way you're helping me. I mean, that's the deal, isn't it?I think I do. Part of me wants to stay here forever and never have to face what's going on outside. But that's not right. Is it? That's not taking responsibility. Not conquering my universe.I want to help you, V. I want to do something. Can we make a deal?Good. That's that, then.V, you said that Latin thing was a quote. Who said it?Uh... thank you.Listen -- I was kind of hoping --No --V?V, what are you doing?Oh no.You can't kill him!Oh god, V. I can't -- I can't --No... I made a mistake.I have to find someone.Oh no... V?You've made a mistake.Please. I haven't done anything --No, please, I didn't do anything.No.No, I --Oh god, I don't --No --I don't know.They were going to rape me, kill me --Please. I didn't do anything.I read her letter. Hid it. Slept. Woke. They questioned me. And I read her letter again.Over and over...Her name was Valerie.No. No, that isn't true --No, wait!I had come to know every inch of those four walls in that dark hell and they knew every inch of me. Every inch...Except one.No.Thank you but I'd rather die behind the chemical sheds.What?You...You did this... to me.You did this to me!You -- You hit me and -- and cut my hair. It was you. It was just you all this time.You tortured me. You tortured me --Oh god, why?Love?Set me free? Don't you realize?Don't you realize what you did to me? You nearly drove me mad!I hate you.I hate you! Set me free? You put me in a prison to set me free?!Shut up! I don't want to hear it. I wasn't in a prison. I was happy! I was happy here --That's warped! That's evil and it's wrong! What gives you the right to judge? Who are you to say what's not good enough?!Shut up! You're mad! I don't want to hear it!I can't feel anything! There's nothing left to feel! Don't you understand?I don't know what -- Oh god -- I can't breathe --What are you doing to me? I can't breathe --I feel -- I feel like I'm going to burst.Oh god -- I felt --Like an angel --Oh god, V, I'm so scared. What's happening to me?The roof? Outside?I -- I don't want to be blindfolded.Everything's so -- different.That was beautiful.I've wanted to do this for a long time.Thank you, V. Thank you for everything you've done for me.It was a good backdrop. I believed it. I really did. It's still a bit hard for me to accept that it wasn't real. That it was just you. Especially the letter.It is a beautiful letter, V. Every time I read it I could feel Valerie, almost like she was holding me. I believed in her most of all. I believed that she loved me and I loved her back.I feel a bit foolish telling you this. I know that you must have written it and thought you should have it back.What?Valerie?She's beautiful.Roses. You grew them for her.They're beautiful.Two days before the first day we met.You're planning something, aren't you, V?What are you going to do?I've never been here before.Oh, V, it's lovely. Where on earth did you find it?What's in these packages?What are you going to do with all of it?Where does this train go?Whitehall... V, that's the New Government Building.But the underground has been shut down for years. How are you going to make it run without any power?Oh, V, turn it off, please.What is that, V?V?V, what's going to happen?Is it going to be violent?But why? Why must is be violent?What is the other face, V?Yes, V?Of course.Tell me.It would be my pleasure.All it takes is a little practice.V? What are you going to do?You're coming back though, aren't you?V, I won't let you leave unless you promise me that you will come back.Just promise.V?You came back.V! V!Oh god, what happened?You need a doctor.No, don't say that!Yes, they need you, V.What?I don't understand.I promise.V, you are not going anywhere!You're not going to die, V!I won't let you die!V!I remember... I remember staring at the mask, at that smile.Part of me couldn't believe he was dead and maybe that was why. The smile was still the same. It made me want to tear it off so I could see the face, so I could see that he was dead.But I had promised.I began to try to imagine his face. Of course, I had long pictured my father behind that smile but I knew in my heart that V was not my father.Yet every time I pictured another face, any face, something was lost, something important was somehow diminished. V was more than a face. V was V.And then, quite suddenly, quite naturally, I realized whose face must be beneath that mask. It was the only face that mattered.I won't let you die.Goodbye, my love.\"Ave Atque vale.\"I looked it up the next morning.\"Hail and farewell.\"They will, my love. They will.\"Remember, remember, the fifth of November!\"I have come here tonight to keep a promise. A promise that is over four hundred years old.

Mr. Heyer, speak for the Eye.Freeze it!Mr. Etheridge, report for the Ear!Very good. Mr. Finch, speak for the Nose.Thank you for that professional annotation.Very good. Gentlemen, keep me informed of any further developments. England prevails.Mr. Almond, do you know what this is behind me?No. No sir. It's more than that. This, this computer is a symbol, Mr. Almond. A symbol of the highest attainable goal of mankind. Do you know what that goal is, Mr. Almond?Control, Mr. Almond! Control! The world around us is a changing, directionless, amoral morass and it is up to man and man alone to set things right!Without control, man is nothing more than any other stinking, sweating, brute animal. Control, Mr. Almond. The control that we have painstakingly built up over the last ten years. Now, do you understand what happened last night?Yes, Mr. Almond. Last night someone did the unthinkable. Someone hurt us. It is imperative that we act swiftly and precisely. I want that man found, Mr. Almond. I want his head or, by god, I'll have yours.Ah, Mr. Finch. I sent for you because what I have to say cannot be said over a phone or a radio. What I have to say cannot leave these four walls. Do I make myself clear?I believe in a few things, Mr. Finch. I believe in god. I believe in the destiny of the Nordic race. And I believe in fascism. The romans invented fascism. They had a symbol for it; a bundle of twigs bound together. One twig could be broken but a bundle would prevail. That is the heart and soul of fascism. Strength in unity. I tell you these things knowing full well that they make you uncomfortable.You have in fact expressed your discomfort in several arrest reports, arrests that were, in your opinion, \"unnecessary.\" The fact that you are here, that you are not rotting in a prison cell, is a mark of my respect and admiration for you, for your craft, and for what you have done for this country.It is also because I know you, Finch. I know what you are. You're a man like me. A man who understands when they are given a job what must be done. I understand you, Finch, and that is why I can trust you.This terrorist knows us, Finch. These attacks are perfectly calculated and they are divisive. He knows what he's doing, Finch. He knows us all too well.What I think is that this man must be stopped. Stopped at all costs and no one, I repeat, no one is to be placed above suspicion. Do I make myself clear?England prevails, Mr. Finch.Enough!Mr. Finch, would you please explain to me the nature of this meeting?! Because I was under the impression that you had some information about the terrorist, codename V!No more questions, understand! I want answers! I am not interested in where he grew up, what kind of flowers he likes or his favorite color!Do I make myself clear?Dismissed. England prevails, Mr. Finch.Mr. Finch, the girl. Do you have anything on the girl?A year, gentlemen.I have given you almost a year and you have given me nothing. Nothing!Yes, Mr. Dascombe, I do know it. It is that very fact that keeps me awake at night, wondering if perhaps there is a reason that Mr. Finch has failed.I'm saying that perhaps I don't know you as well as I thought I did.No, I am asking for some goddamn results!It's over, is it? He's gone. Vanished, you say?Transcripts recorded over the last thirty days in which the terrorist was talked about or mentioned in a positive context. This is only thirty days!Is this what you consider, \"disappeared?\"Mr. Creedy, I want the producers, writers, and actors of that \"stupid variety show\" arrested and charged with sedition.Push me, Roger, push me and you'll find out how serious I am.This, this V is still out there. I can feel him like a sickness worming its way into the hearts and minds of the public. Something must be done, and done quickly, to exorcise this demon for the very soul of this country is at stake.That is why I am compelled to give each and every one of you notice that if by the fifth of November you are still giving me nothing more than excuses, I will have to revoke your party status and terminate your positions.Mr. Creedy, I will speak with you in private. The rest of you are dismissed. England prevails.Mr. Creedy, as the new head of the Finger, you are the most important member of my cabinet.Your predecessor, Mr. Almond, was a good man, a man who understood what strength in unity meant, a man who, above all, loved his country. I need to know if you are such a man.Do you love your country, Mr. Creedy?Yes, Mr. Creedy?When?Damn you! Damn you!Lieutenant, ready my transport. I want every armed man within a hundred miles at Jordan tower. Now!I want this man dead! I want him shot on sight!Who was it? Who was he?Roger Dascombe! Of course. Of course! It makes such perfect sense.No! There is no mistake!Who? Who are these people? They must be detained immediately. Whatever they saw or whatever they think they saw is subordinate to the truth and that truth is that Roger Dascombe is the terrorist and the terrorist is dead!Finch, what are you doing here?Be careful, Finch.The terrorist is dead!Are you challenging my authority?I am trying to run a country! When I tell you, Mr. Finch, the terrorist is dead, then the terrorist is dead! If you continue to suggest otherwise then you will leave me no choice but to have you arrested on charges of sedition. Do I make myself clear?Now, it is imperative for the people of London to know that they are safe, that the terrorist is dead and everything is under control.Good evening London. As Leader of this great country, I felt it imperative to speak with you and to assure you once and for all that the shadow that recently fell across our land has indeed passed.What we have endured this long year was no accident, no mere coincidence. This was not a simple act of terror conducted by a singular madman. No, this was a test.It was not me, nor the Party, nor the government that was threatened this year. It was our beliefs. Our faith. I believe that God himself bore witness to our struggle and like Job I believe that we have been vindicated.How do I know this? Let me read to you where I found the answer, where I so often find the answer. In the Scripture. Revelations.\"If any man have an ear, let him hear.\"\"He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity; he that killeth with the sword shall be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and faith of the Saints.\"\"And I beheld another beast coming out of the Earth; and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon.\"\"And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from Heaven on the Earth in the sight of men.\"\"And he deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth by the means of those miracles which he had the power to do --\"His wife?Now what's this all about, Mrs. Heyer?Protect you from what?Come now, Mrs. Heyer.Let who hurt you?The terrorist is dead.How?Who? Who is it, woman?What?!How do you know?But how did you know it was Heyer?But you have no proof?Yes, proof? This is an extremely delicate situation, Mrs. Heyer. It has been reported that the terrorist is dead. It would be a catastrophe to arrest a man now without concrete, conclusive proof. Do you have any evidence at all?But if you're right, if Heyer is indeed the terrorist...Yes, Mr. Heyer, your wife has done her duty to her country.Don't worry, Mrs. Heyer. You will be taken care of. I will launch an immediate investigation and I promise, you will be the first to know when an arrest will be made.Subversion, Mr. Heyer. Your wife was privy to the dialogue of subversives. That's all you need to know at this time. Lieutenant!The Heyers are leaving. I need to see Mr. Creedy at once.Mr. Finch?I'm coming with you.There will be no discussion --I am sick to death of this terrorist being everywhere and nowhere! I will judge whether Mr. Finch is right and I will judge it with my own eyes! Do I make myself clear, Captain?Is there a problem, Mr. Finch?Good. Captain, mobilize your men.We'll find this bloody bastard and we will finish him.Mark my words, Mr. Finch, this man is going to become an example so that every man, woman, and child in this country will remember what happens to those who would ever think to stand against the state.Captain, I need a gas unit down here with enough nerve gas to fill every rat-hole in these tunnels.There are over one hundred of the best trained soldiers in this country down here. Let him come.Captain, what's happening?Don't tell me you're a coward, Mr. Finch.This was your idea.What trick is this?This is an outrage! I order you not to listen to this!Captain, order all your men to fall back and secure this position!Any man that disobeys this order will be court marshaled!Captain! Captain, where are your men?Goddammit, I will not tolerate this insubordination! I want those deserters shot, Captain.Shot on sight!Traitors! You cowards!I know who you are! I'll see you hang! Every last one of you!Finch? Finch! Finch, goddammit, you can't leave me! Don't leave me!Damn you! Damn you!Conrad? Is that you? You're working with Finch, aren't you? And Creedy! You're all in this together!Who are you?Noooo!Mr. Finch! Oh god, Mr. Finch!Oh, I knew it, Mr. Finch. I knew you wouldn't desert me. You're a good man, Finch. A damn good man.Careful, Mr. Finch. He's quick as the devil.Mr. Finch, what are you doing? Shoot him. Kill the bastard, Finch.Finch, I order you to shoot him! Finch!I warned you, Finch, the penalty for treason is death.Are you ready to die?Do you really believe you can pick up that knife before I pull this trigger?", "clean_line": "gentlemen hear reports mr

These appear to be individually weighted flares and we have found traces of the same chemicals at both of the detonation sites which leads us to conclude that, despite a level of sophistication, these devices are all home-made with over the counter chemicals, making them impossible to trace. Whoever he is, Leader, he's good.Hmm. It's a rose. A violet carson, I believe. Strange.I didn't think they still existed.Now?Send the rose to the lab. Also, scrape a sample of this paint and have it analyzed as well. I'll be back as soon as I can.Yes, sir.Well, I...You think he's an insider?Perfectly.England prevails.I want those tapes from the Ear in my office tonight, Dominic.Any word from your superior, Mr. Creedy?Quite.Background noise?What music did he play?Da, da, da, dum. That's code. Morse code.For the letter \"V\".Anything on the girl yet?What is it?He made him eat a host.And then just Beethoven's fifth.We have got the initial path report back. The host was full of cyanide.And do you know what?When it reached his abdomen, it was still cyanide.Just lives.I know it's too early for your profile but do you have any initial impressions?Bloody hell.Perhaps Fate will make something more of all this. I certainly can't.Quite. Government directed terrorism never sews healthy ideas into the public. Oh, that reminds me.Can you tell us anything about this?We found one in the carriage with Prothero and this one in the Bishop's quarters. A violet carson.I heard that strain had died off. Thought a botanist might shed some light on it. Delia?Magic. I'll drop by tomorrow then.A connection?What about codename V?Five is the letter V. Brilliant, Dominic.All we need is Larkhill's employment records.Oh my god.Oh bloody hell.Oh no.Delia?Get an ambulance.That's the last entry until six months later when Dr. Surridge is back in London. There is no mention of the man in room five again. End of story.Except that it wasn't the end of the story.Between 2009 and 2012, over forty men and women who were previously stationed at Larkhill met with what were believed to be accidental deaths. Eventually, only three remained.The three he'd been saving until last.Everyone who worked at Larkhill. Everyone who could have identified him. You see there are two possible motives here. Not one.The first is revenge. He escapes from Larkhill and vows to get even with his tormentors. The whole exercise an elaborate, chilling vendetta.That's the explanation that I find most reassuring, funnily enough. Because that means he's finished. It's over now.The second motive is more sinister. Like I said, everyone who could have identified him is dead.What if he's just been clearing the ground?What if he's planning something else?You see, the diary we found was in full view. We didn't have to search for it. He left it there. He wanted us to find it. He wanted us to know the story. Or...For all we know, the diary could be a complete and utter fake. Codename V could have written it himself.He's playing games with us. He might never have been at Larkhill at all. Do you see? It could all be another smoke screen, a false trail, another cover story --Yes, Leader.No, Leader. Not yet.No, but I can guess.\"Remember, remember, the fifth of November.\"Not for us.What are you saying?Are you asking for my resignation?I don't know how you stand that tripe.Don't you see, Dominic?I'm V.Why don't you just shoot me, Creedy? Wouldn't that make everything a lot simpler?He has to be at Jordan tower. Come on!But I thought I was the terrorist.Since I'm not in jail and since you have another, even more convenient suspect. I'm guessing the charges have been dropped.I am careful, sir. Always. That is why I suggest that a search of this building begin immediately.With all due respect, I disagree and I believe that he is presently trying to get out of this building disguised as one of us.No sir, I'm trying to run an investigation --Play it again.I don't know. For twenty seven years, I've been at this job. Twenty seven years, I've done what I've been told to do. Maybe that's all there is to it. I'm just a dumb old dog. A dumb old dog that only knows one trick.Maybe. And maybe I'm not ready for a revolution.We will.It's on the tape. I know it. I can feel it. He did this for a reason. He needs something.The line of the Queen?Maybe it's a line from Shakespeare. Or a book. I don't know.But right here. He's talking to someone. Someone specific. Someone who knows what he wants.Eighteen hours.Dominic!Dominic, go home.Forget it. There's no more time. You go home and get some rest. You're going to need it tonight.Yes, he does.Give it up, old man. You're not even sure you want to stop him.Christ! That's it! It's got to be it!Oh my god.Is the Leader in?Perfect.Leader, I need as many men the Captain can spare and I need them right now.To capture codename V.He's underground. The old subway. I know exactly what he's going to do. If we move quickly, we can be there, waiting for him.Leader, every second we delay...No... no sir.I don't think that will be necessary.This... this is a mistake.Leader, we have to get out of here!It was a mistake. This is what he wants. He knows us, Leader. He knows us too well. We have to get out of here before it's too late --Don't move!Drop the knife.No, Mr. Susan. No, I'm not.
