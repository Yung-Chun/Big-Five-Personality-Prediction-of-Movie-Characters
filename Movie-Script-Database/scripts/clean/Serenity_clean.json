He drops to one knee, slamming his baton to the floor.We can't make it to the surface from inside. Simon turns suddenly as he hears footsteps, people heading at them from the other side of the doors. 4wo SIMONGet on! He is standing by the window -- and the Security Agent is right behind him, PUNCHING the window with all his might. Simon helps River onto the gurney, then jumps on himself as the Security Agent cracks the glass. The two are whisked up in the gurney, River on her knees, Simon standing beside her holding one of the cables --I'm not worried.This isn't fear. This is anger.I imagine if it were fear, my eyes would be wider.You're not taking her.She's not going with you. That's final.Guests? I earn my passage, Captain --I've earned my passage treating bullet holes, knife wounds, laser burns...And you want to put my sister in the middle of that.She's a seventeen year old girl. A mentally traumatized sevente--And that's your guiding star, isn't it? What's of use.Do you understand what I've gone through to keep River away from the Alliance?Are you threatening to --River... She's lying on her side, looking straight at us. A loose summer dress draped over her small frame.Now, River, you stay behind the others. If there's fighting you drop to the floor or run away. It's okay to leave them to die. River puts on a huge pair of goggles, looks at her brother.It's amazing. I bring River all the way out to the raggedy edge of the 'verse so she can hide from the Alliance by robbing banks.River?You stupid, selfish, son of a whore ---\"One simple job! She'll be fine!\"Never again. You understand me?Well sleep easy 'cause we're off your boat. Just as soon as River gets her share of the \"bounty\".Kaylee. She turns and heads off. Simon starts in the other direction, but River looks after her and the others.No, I fear it's not safe anymore. He's heading off and doesn't hear:Eta Kooram Nah Smech! And River drops to the ground, fast asleep. There is a beat. Mal looks around the bar. He and Simon, who has run up to the entrance, are the only ones standing. He looks down at River. She lies unconscious, helpless.May I see her?Safeword.A phrase that's encoded in her brain, that makes her fall asleep. If I speak the words, \"Eta --What?They never said what --I brought her out here so they couldn't get to her, I don't even know how they --I thought she was getting better.May I see her. Mal steps aside. Simon enters the locker.I'm sorry...It's okay, it's okay...You said something. When you were triggered, do you remember? The Captain saw you say something on the feed...Miranda.Show us what? Who is Miranda?No. Right. But I think somehow when they triggered you it brought this up, this memory --I won't.Don't say that. Not ever. We'll get through this. She reaches out and touches his face, affectionately.Well, the Captain hasn't tossed us in the airlock, so I'd say we're --River. What will Miranda show us. She thinks.Whose death? And she starts laughing. Quietly at first, then louder, then almost uncontrollably, screaming in his face:Needs to see her why?Did he say anything about a \"Miranda\"?We'll get off. River and I'll get off at Haven and find some --It's gonna be oka -- She elbows his throat viciously. He drops to his knees, shocked and gasping, as she spin-kicks him to the ground. He doesn't move. She looks at him a moment, then takes off.You could've asked...Are you insane?What's the point of living if you sink to the level of a savage --Kaylee... Come this way. Come here. Don't -- But she looks --There's no discoloration, nobody's doubled over or showing signs of pain...More than anything, it looks like starvation.River...Do we have a plan?It's okay... -Just stay low. I'm right here.I never planned... anything. I just wanted to keep River safe. Spent so much time on Serenity trying to find us a home I never realized I already had.

The action freezes.Biograph. Simon Tam.Enter the doctor. Forgive me. I prefer to see the event alone, without bias. Mathias looks at the hologram -- realizes which one it is.You're right to insist. I know you've had security issues here. He places his hand on a screen as he says it. Mathias looks at the readout, and drops the bluster.I have neither. Like this facility, I don't exist. The Parliament calls me in when... when they wish they didn't have to. Let's talk about the Tams.River was your greatest success. A prodigy -- A phenomenon. Until her brother walked in eight months ago and took her from you.I'm very aware of that.No, no. Of course. The boy spent his fortune developing the contacts to infiltrate this place.Madness, no. Something a good deal more dangerous. Have you looked at this scan carefully? At his face? Mathias looks uncertain.I'm here because the situation is even less simple than you think. Do you know what your sin is, Doctor?Key members of Parliament. Key. The minds behind every diplomatic, military and covert operation in the galaxy, and you put them in a room with a psychic.It's come to our attention that River became much more unstable, more... disturbed, after you showed her off to Parliament. Did she see something very terrible in those cards?But they are in her. Her mind is unquiet. It's the will of the Parliament that I kill her. And the brother. Because of your sin.You know, in certain older civilized cultures, when men failed as entirely as you have, they would throw themselves on their swords.The Parliament has no further interest in psychics. They represent a threat to the harmony and stability of our Alliance.Would you be killed in your sleep, like an ailing pet? Whatever your failings, I believe you deserve better than that. The agents move. He slices the throat of the one behind him with true grace, thrusting at the second as he's pulling out his gun and pinning his hand. A moment, and the dying agent reflexively squeezes the trigger, shooting his own arm. The Operative pulls out the sword and the agent falls as quietly as the first. Mathias bolts but the Operative pins him to the wall. He bunches his fingers and jabs the side of the Doctor's spine. Mathias stiffens, suddenly, agonizingly immobile. The Operative steps back, observes the Doctor's rigid grimace for a moment. Almost ceremoniously, he drops to one knee and holds the blade out to one side, hilt to the floor and point tilted toward the doctor. The Doctor stares at it in horror as his paralyzed body begins to tip over toward it. The Operative turns toward the terrified intern at the door.The ship. The name of the ship.Serenity Valley. Bloodiest battle of the entire war. The Independents held the valley for seven weeks, two of them after their high command had surrendered. 68% casualty rate.There.She's followed him far... Give me the crew, registered passengers -- Our Captain is a passionate man, no room there for subtlety. He's bound to have some very obvious... CLOSE ON: THE LENS of his glasses. On it is a slowly moving picture of INARA.-40 .weakness...I've no doubt. Mal sheds his shawl and robe. Inara kneels at the alter, picks out another incense stick.That's very thoughtful. But I mean it when I say you're not in any danger.I think you're beginning to understand how dangerous River Tam is.It's worse than you know.That girl will rain destruction down on you and your ship. She's an albatross, Captain.I've seen your war record. I know how you must feel about the Alliance.Fair to say. But I have to hope you understand you can't beat us.And you can do that, once you let me take the girl back home. Give me the opportunity to help you.This psychotic, potentially murderous girl who can't have the slightest awareness of your protection. This is where you \"draw the line\".There's a number of lives that hang in the balance here. Lives under your care. Are they as whimsical as yourself?I have a warship in deep orbit, Captain. We locked on to Serenity's pulse beacon the moment you hit atmo. I can speak a word and send a missile to that exact location inside of three minutes. Mal pulls a small device, clipped wires sticking out all around it, and tosses it to the Operative.Pulse beacon.How long do you think you can really run from us?Captain Reynolds, I should tell you so that you don't waste your time: You can't make me angry.I need her, Captain. River is... my purpose and I will gather her to me. The brother as well. Whatever else happens is incidental. In the greater scheme.I want to resolve this like civilized men. I'm not threatening you. I'm unarmed.I am of course wearing full body armor. I'm not a moron. He tosses Mal hard against a wall, spinning and blocking a blow from Inara -- she is clearly trained in martial arts, but he flat-heels her to the ground within seconds. Mal is going for his gun again, turning, and the Operative kicks him in the face, sends him back, gun flying. Mal gets to his feet and they square off. Mal breathing hard, nose dripping blood. The Operative perfectly poised, waiting.They'll come when they're needed.Captain, what do you think is going to happen here? They come at each other. The Operative is the much better trained -- he's fluid, his blows sparse and deadly.He's not the plucky hero. The Alliance isn't some evil empire. This isn't the grand arena.Just a flash bomb. Go! Go!Forget the pulse beacon, there has to be another way to track the ship -- get a read on the nav sat. It's a registered transport, you must be able to locate --Have you found a nav sat trajectory?Does he think this is a game?V0 I'm sorry. But I cannot let you hide and I cannot let you run. Things become... extreme. And we wish for another way.When God wanted Pharaoh to release His people from bondage -- you know the story? He didn't ask. He sent his plagues down upon Egypt. That's me, Captain. The path to peace is paved with corpses. It's always been so.I'm not going to live there. How could you think -- there's no place for me there, any more than 40 there is for you. Malcolm, I'm a monster. What I do is evil, I've no illusions about it. But it must be done.It's not my place to ask.Maybe not. But you'll keep her close now, and when I blow Serenity out of the air, this will be ended. You're so terribly out of your depth, Captain. Your old boat can't take the pressure.Yes, your scrambler's code is too old for our seekers. You love that, yes? The small triumph over modernity. You really are the noble savage.But that's what's going to kill you, Malcolm. Nobility. It confuses your text, which is self-interest. And sin.What do you believe in?If that were true, you'd be nothing more than a Reaver. Something changes in Mal's expression.Define \"disappeared\". The Ensign just looks uncomfortable.Lock and fire on my command. You should have let me see her. We should have done this as men. Not with fire...Vessel in range, lock on...That's not good...Target the Reavers! Target the Reavers! Target everyone! Somebody FIRE!There's a lot of innocent people in the air being killed right now.You really believe that?You willing to die for that belief?You know what your sin is, Malcolm?I'm sorry. The Operative spins him and DIGS his bunched fingers right into the same nerve cluster that he paralyzed Doctor Mathias with. Mal goes rigid, his face a rictus of pain. The Operative goes near the railing and retrieves his sword. Mal trembles, trying to move -- but nothing happens.Do you know what an uproar you've caused? Protests, riots -- cries for a recall of the entire Parliament.You must be pleased.I can't guarantee they won't come after you. The Parliament. They have a hundred men like me and they are not forgiving.I told them the Tams were no longer a threat -- damage done.You won't. There is... .nothing left to see. Mal looks at him a moment, then picks up his gear to head inside. The Operative starts away into the rain, then stops to look up at the nose of the ship.

He's addressing the pilot, WASH. Flight gear and a hawaiian shirt, toy dinosaurs populating his station -- no old soldier, but just as startled.Was that the primary buffer panel?Did the Primary Buffer Panel just fall off my gorramn ship for no apparent reason? Another buck --I thought Kaylee checked our entry couplings! I have a very clear memory of it --Define \"Interesting\".This is the Captain. There's a little problem with our entry sequence; we may experience slight turbulence and then explode. Can you shave the vector --Just get us on the ground!Jayne, how many weapons you plan on bringing? You only got the two arms...I don't plan on any shooting taking place during this job.No grenades. No grenades. First Mate ZOE enters from the lower level. Her mode of dress and military deference mark her as a war buddy of Mal's.Talk to your husband. Is the mule prepped?Kaylee! He enters:Kaylee, what in the sphincter of hell are you playing at? The hall leads to the rust-brown chaos that is the engine room. Working around the engine in a forest of wires, sparks and smoke is the sweetly pretty mechanic, KAYLEE. She passes Mal with a slightly impatient smile as he stands in the doorway, raising his voice above the din.You told me --My ship don't crash. If she crashes, you crashed her.Fear is nothing to be ashamed of, Doc.I'll look for that next time.No no, that's not a thing I'm interested in talking over with --I hear the words \"that's final\" come out of your mouth ever again, they truly will be. This is my boat. Y'all are guests on it. He heads down a side corridor that has steps leading down to:And it's time your little sister learned from your fine example.Some of our jobs are trickier than others --Didn't say 'want'. Said 'will'. It's one job, Doc. She'll be fine. The passenger dorm has a time-worn warmth that most of the ship shares. Except, of course, for the sterile blue of:She's a reader. Sees into the truth of things; might see trouble before it's coming. Which is of use to me.I do, and it's a fact me and mine have been courteous enough to keep to our own selves.I got one purpose here: keep this boat in the air. I take the jobs I get -- which is less and less, case you ain't been keeping track. He starts away, Simon still keeping pace.So here is us, on the raggedy edge. Don't push me and I won't push you. Simon starts up the stairs as Mal calls to him:If Fanty and Mingo are right about the payroll, this could look to be a sunny day for us.Doctor, I'm taking your sister under my protection here. If anything happens to her, anything at all, I swear to you I will get very choked up. Honestly. There could be tears. He peels out, leaves Simon fuming. Kaylee sidles up to him...Alliance payroll. There's peace enforcing squads stationed all about this quadrant. Can't use credits out here -- they got to pay their boys in cashy money. Which once a month rests here.You ready to go to work, darlin'?Right. Great. Let's go.Hands and knees and heads bowed down! Everybody, now! Two men who appear to be farm folk rush Mal and the others. Mal draws on the elder one and he stops dead in his tracks. Mal's gun is long, not unlike Civil War era issue, but very much new in design. The other tries to tackle Jayne, which is not necessarily a great idea. Jayne clotheslines him so hard he spins right upside-down -- and Jayne grabs him by the legs and CRACK! -- bounces his head right off the floor, knocking him out cold.You've probably guessed we mean to be thieving here, but what we are after is not yours. So let's have no undue fussing. As he is speaking, Jayne is scrambling to the back office, finding the small vault locked.The old man punches in the code. What opens is a tiny wall safe. Bundles of bills, some scattered coin. Unimpressive. Jayne and Zoe are behind the captain, peering in.Is there a fed down there? Be truthful.War's long done. We're all just folk now. Listen up! We are coming down to empty that vault! The voice of a young Alliance GUARD comes up from below.Leg's good, it'll bleed plenty and we avoid any necessary organs...Well you don't want it to look like you just gave up...Every heist, he's gotta start yelling my name --Get on the mule. (to the guard, pointing to theYou get everyone upstairs in there and you seal it. Long as you got air you don't open up, you understand?Zoe take the wheel --Get in the vault with the others --It's too many. Drive, Zoe. A Reaver craft ROARS over their heads. It's nearly the size of Serenity. Torn apart, belching smoke -- a welded conglomeration of ruined ships, painted for war. Predator, pure. It disappears over the rooftops.Drive! Zoe's face is set with unhappy determination as she floors it, shooting out and leaving the young man in the dust. As they move from him, four Reavers jump out of the shadows and grab the young man. Mal unhesitatingly draws his gun. He nudges a lever with his thumb and a cartridge pops back. Mal fires twice. The young man takes both bullets in the chest, slumps down dead.They wanna run us down. The up- close kill. River is squashed down on her back, being very small.Grab on! Jayne grabs the Mule, legs dangling, pulled out between the two vessels as Mal slams a new cartridge into his pistol.Is he okay? A bloodied Reaver POPS into frame from under the skiff-top. He lunges for Mal, baring sharpened teeth -- Mal spins and draws, fires into his belly as Jayne and Zoe both fire at the same time. The freak takes too long to go down, but down he goes. Dies sitting against the s i op. 4 Everybody takes a moment to look at each other.Set course for Beaumonde. First thing, I want these bod -- Simon suddenly punches him in the face, causing Mal to stumble back, and Simon to shake his hand in pain.I'm a hair's breadth from riddling you with holes, Doctor --She IS fine! Except for bein' still crazy, she's the picture of health!Seems I remember a talk about you giving orders on my boat.No, shiny! I'm sick a' carrying tourists anyhow. We'll be on Beaumonde in ten hours time, you can pick up your earnings and be on your merry. Meantime you do your job. Patch up my crew. A beat.Doc made his call. They's as babes in a basket when we took 'em in; we sheltered 'em plenty. Man has to cut loose, learn to stand on his own.I had to shoot him. What the Reavers woulda done to him before they killed him...We couldn't take the weight. Woulda slowed us down.Mule won't run with five. I shoulda dumped the girl? Or you? Or Jayne?And go to Fanty and Mingo with air in our mitts, tell 'em \"here's your share\"? They'd set the dogs on us in the space of a twitch, and there we are back in mortal peril. We get a job, we gotta vo make good. Washenters from the bridge.Maybe that's why we lost. She's not happy with the reply. Mal climbs down to his room as Wash reaches Zoe, slides his arms around her.It's not my fault the Doc's got no stomach for Rim living --What? Swept you into his cleanly arms? Made tidy love to you? They have reached the guncheck, where Jayne and Wash have already checked their guns. It works like a lunch automat: Mal sticks his gun in a drawer, pulls out a chit -- the q0 drawer closes and rotates, revealing another empty one. A large bouncer with a shockrod watches impassively.Oh god! I can't know that!Mingo. Fanty.He's Fanty. You're Mingo.Fanty's prettier. Feel to do some business?Which means at least four of the guys already in here are yours. All's one. I'll just keep Jayne with me.Go. Go get yourselves a nice romantic meal.It's business. We're fine. They leave and the four remaining men sit. Fanty tosses a few coins to a saloon-girl, who does a little fan-dance... ANGLE: THE CORVUE CAMERA'S POV of the men is conveniently blocked by her little dance. Mal's foot nudges a duffel bag of money to Mingo's foot.Yeah, they're a fine bunch of ruebens.So I'm noticing. Is there a problem I don't know of? You got 25% of a sweet take kissing your foot, how come we're not dispersing?Well here's a foul thought. I conjured you two were incompetent; sent us out not knowing there were V0 Reavers about. Now I'm thinking you picked us out because you did.River...I think maybe we ought to leave.She's still napping just now. And I believe you've got some storytelling to do.It's likely. I know she meant to Ad kill me 'fore the Doc put her to sleep, which how exactly does that work anyhow?\"In case something happened.\"You feel to elaborate on what that something might be? I mean they taught you that fancy safeword, they must've figured she was gonna, what -- start uncontrollably crocheting?And you never did ask. Mal grabs him and throws him against the wall, in his face.My ship. My crewi You had a gorramn timebomb living with us!What if she went off in the middle woo of dinner, or in bunk with Kaylee, did that give you a moment's pause? Simon looks at Kaylee, the truth of Mal's words hitting him.It's crossed my mind.What about this? Did this make the... puppet theatre?You can do that?Can you go back? See if anybody spoke with her 'fore she acted up, -40 made any kind of contact with her... Mr Universe works the screen. The image rewinds and stops on River coming up to it, looking at it. She whispers the word, \"Miranda\", and starts to move away.Um... please? Mr Universe has a third screen showing the commercial asSubliminal. It's a subliminal message broadwaved to trigger her.Hope that ain't for me, Shepherd.Then I really hope it ain't for me.Weren't River that did it, you know that. Somebody decided her brain was just another piece of property to take, fenced it right Vd up.Hiding ain't a plan?.but they'll be coming. Alliance is after this girl with a powerful will. I look to hear the tromp of their boots any moment.I coulda left her there.I had an out -- hell, I had every reason in the 'verse to leave her lay and haul anchor.You just think that 'cause my eyes is all sorrowful and pretty.Sermons make me sleepy, Shepherd. I ain't looking for help from on high. That's a long wait for a train don't come.It's of interest to me how much you seem to know about that world.Have to tell me about that some time.Whuh huh nuhwhat?Inara. REVERSE ON: Inara on Mal's screen. We see her from about chest level up. She, presumably, sees the same.Good as any.Naked as the day I come cryin'. How's your world?Still at the Training House?I remember it as nice enough. picturesque.You could use a gun hand?Payment is never not a factor. I could sound out the crew... This pot like to boil over soon?Well, it would be, I mean I would like to... Kaylee's been missing you something fierce --Yeah, you left a... got some of your stuff in a trunk, never did get a chance to drop it off.I didn't look through the... stuff... just sundries I expect.Trap.If that's the case, then Inara's already caught in it. She wouldn't set us up willing. Might be we got a shot at seeing who's turning these wheels. We go in.Y'all were watching, I take it. Guilty glances.140 You see us fight?Trap.They're about. Find us a home. I'll take the shuttle in closer. Zoe, ship is yours. 4dO He starts out, turns back to Zoe.Dear Buddha, please send me a pony, and a plastic rocket, and --You invited me.Well that makes you kind of a tease, doesn't it?Which led me to the conclusion that you must be in some trouble.For a woman schooled in telling men what they wanna hear, you ain't much of a liar.What are you doing?Speak your piece.She is a mite unpredictable. Mood swings, of a sort.It usually is.Way I remember it, albatross was a ship's good luck... til some idiot killed it. Yes, I've read a poem. Try not to faint. The Operative moves further into the room. Whenever he moves, Mal counters.You really don't.I got no need to beat you. I just wanna go my way.All I gotta do is let you take one more thing away from me. I've had a lot of things taken in my time. And it may just be that this is one too many.Well I'm a whimsical soul.I got no notion that I'm being heroical at all. Any more than I think you're really just a harmless bureaucrat come to help me out. You move like a killer. The Operative is stopped by this. Unhappily, he continues:You do that, best make peace with your dear and fluffy lord.Advice from an old tracker: you J wanna find someone, use your eyes.Oh, a jack-rabbit, me. 'Sides, I never credited the Alliance with an over-abundance of brains. And if you're the best they got...Why is it that the greater scheme always makes everything not that great?Great! He draws and shoots the Operative in the chest. The Operative goes down as Mal grabs Inara, moves for the-doorway. The Operative is on him in a second, choke-hold from behind.No back up? We're making an awful ruckus...I'd start whistling..I had him...I think that I was winning!4 You sure you remember how it -- He nearly falls over as:He didn't beat me up --Give the two of them up. Go my way.Cutting them loose ain't the same as handing them over.Don't know who or what, but it's on River's mind. Conjure it might be the reason he's after her.Look, we get back to Haven in a 'r/ few hours time --You wanna run this ship?Well you can't!I didn't start this.Are you telling me that because you think I don't know --I came looking for you.I start fighting a war I guarantee you'll see something new.But you fog things up. You always have -- you spin me about. I wish like hell you was elsewhere.The other way! Find her and-do not engage! Everyone piles out the other way. Simon remains, to look in the window.Check the shuttles. She coulda 40 snuck in. He pops the panel off and starts wriggling in among the wires.The government's man, he says you're a danger to us. Not worth helping. Is he right? Are you anything but a weapon? I've staked my crew's life on the a - person-,-- - actual and whole, and if I'm wrong you'd best shoot me now. Or we could talk more...Because there isn't one. It's a blackrock. Uninhabitable. Terraforming didn't hold, or somesuch. Few settlers died.Half of writing history is hiding the truth. There's something on this rock the Alliance doesn't want known.Shouldn't've been you. I'm so sorry, it was... they should've hit us. They should've hit me.I seen.You did what's right.Doc'll bring you round. I look to be bored by many more sermons 'fore you slip -- don't move --Yes you are. Book coughs up blood, grabbing Mal. Urgent, almost angry.Come on, keep it up -- Book grabs Mal's face, talks as though replying to something:Don't talk at me like a righteous man. You are a killer of children.So me and mine got to lie down andWhy? Do you know why?You will never see River Tam. I'm telling you this.She ain't buckled yet. And the 40 only reason you're talking such a lot is you can't get a fix on us.Nobody -- ever -- calls me noble.Only- many-I-know-who still --bel i-eved- in sin just died by your hand.Not a solitary thing.Get these bodies together.Zoe, you and Simon are gonna rope V0 'em together. Five or six of 'em. I want them laid out on the nose of our ship.Kaylee, I need you to muck the reactor core, just enough to leave a trail and make it read like we're flying without containment, not enough to fry us.Kaylee, you got a day's work to do and two hours to do it.I mean to live. I mean for us to live. The Alliance won't have that, so we go where they won't follow.This is how it works. Anybody doesn't wanna fly with me anymore, this is your port of harbour. There's a lot of fine ways to die. I'm not waiting for the Alliance to choose mine. He walks through the group, toward the smashed cockpit of the Alliance fighter. Struggling to get out is the badly wounded pilot. He sees Mal coming and raises his hands in surrender. Mal shoots him in the head, turns back.Didn't see you.Anything of use in there?You don't have to stay in the shuttle, you know. There's empty rooms, if you wanna sleep awhile.Cheerful fellow. Did you really miss this place?Why did you leave? Site does lo9}E-at-- t -m-I, uh, I'd better go check on the VW crew. See how the inevitable mutiny is coming along. They both want to say more. They don't. He goes.Nothing at all?Find it.Well something sure as hell ain't right... WIDER ANGLE: They're in a CITY. Gleaming metal, spread out for miles in every direction. Portions decimated by fires long since cold, others overgrown with weeds, but mostly intact. But silent, as if trapped in amber.Beacon's up ahead.Poison?Place must've gone hermetic when the power blew. Sealed 'em.There's gasses that kill painless, right?Anybody want to bet there's plenty of food around?I seen so much death... I been on fields carpeted with bodies, friends and enemies -- I seen men and women blown to messes no further from me than you.But every single one of those people died on their feet. Fighting.This report is maybe twelve years old. Parliament buried it, and it stayed buried til River dug it up. This is what they feared she knew. And they were right to fear, 'cause there's a universe of folk that are gonna know it too. They're gonna see it. Somebody has to speak for these people. He pauses. Everyone waits.That the same grandma told you 4 there was an evil dwarf spirit living in your well?Mr Universe. We haven't the equipment to broadwave this code, but he can put it on every screen for thirty worlds. He's pretty damn close, too.No. He takes a long moment, his jaw tightening imperceptibly.We won't be long.You'll let us know if anyone else comes at you?We're too close for them to arm --Chickens come home to roost... They are suddenly JOLTED by a glancing blow from another ship -- Wash struggles to control her --What does that mean?Where's the back up? Where's the back up? He and Wash are frantically flipping buttons -- the ship whirs to a semblance of life - -Everybody to the upper decks! Strap yourselves to something!Head inside!Come on. Jayne, rearguard. Zoe slows, looking around her.We all stay together --Then shut 'em and hide til --Tell me you brought 'em this time... Jayne smiles grimly, tosses Mal a grenade as he pops his own and fastballs it at the Reavers.Zoe... are you here? She looks up at him.You hold. Hold till I'm back. He takes off -- passes Inara, the two of them holding a look for as long as they can. Then he's in the elevator and gone. Jayne moves over to Zoe.Guy killed me, Mal.Hard to get to. That's a fact.Shot me in the back. I haven't... made you angry, have I? I sYou have no idea how true that is. There's no wise-ass attitude in him now. They stand, facing off at ten paces.I do.Aw hell, I'm a fan of all seven. He headbutts the Operative viciously, then punches him so hard he staggers back, losing his grip on the sword. The Operative responds with a spin kick -- Mal holds up the screwdriver and the Operative swings his foot right into it, gasping as Mal pulls the screwdriver -- and leg it's stuck in -- back as he rockets his fist into the Operative's chin. The Operative goes down hard, dazed, as Mal grabs the sword still in his belly.Iwo Well, I'm known for that. The Operative drops the blade, mouth open, stumbling back, unable to make a sound. Mal spins him, grabbing both his arms and working his own through them in a twisted full nelson -- then bringing his arms up suddenly, the Operative's mouth going wider as we hear his arms crack. Mal drops him sitting against the railing, picks up his sword, saying:If you're here to tell me we ain't finished... then we will be real quick. The Operative stands just under the canopy of the nose of the ship, framed by the rain behind.'Verse wakes up a spell. Won't be long 'fore she rolls right over and falls back asleep. Taint my worry.That don't bode especially well for you... giving the order to let us go, patching up our hurt...You still standing there when the engine starts, you never will figure it out. The Operative watches the door shut. A moment, and he goes.What a whiner...Think she'll hold together?Make sure everything's secure. Could be bumpy.We're taking her out. Should be about a day's ride to get you back to your girls.You ready to get off this heap and back to a civilized life?Good answer. He turns and heads into the bridge.You gonna ride shotgun, help me fly? V0 River is in the copilot's seat, looking intently at the screens and buttons.Think you can work out how to get her in the -- She is flipping switches without even looking, as the ship hums to life.Okay, clearly some aptitude for the... but it ain't all buttons A0 and charts, . You know what the first rule of flying is? Well, I suppose you do, since you already know what I'm about to say.Love. You can learn all the math in the 'verse, but you take a boat in the air you don't love, she'll shake you off just as sure as the turning of worlds. Love keeps her in the air when she oughta fall down, tells you she's hurting 'fore she keens. Makes her a home. River also looks out at the sky.We'll pass through it soon enough.", "clean_line": "addressing pilot wash flight gear hawaiian shirt toy dinosaurs populating station old soldier startled primary
