{"Extract": {"JOEL": {"raw_line": "You always give me free drinks though. DEAN Oh yeah. Well come by anyway.Yeah?... Might as well. No action going on at my house, that's for sure. DEAN Really? The wife out of town?No... I just haven't been laid in a month.No. This is pretty much normal these days... As CREDITS continue, camera PULLS OUT, back down to the manufacturing area, past a big vat of orange extract, down through various stages of assembly line production, then follows several bottles of orange extract moving past HECTOR, a Mexican immigrant employee in his thirties. The camera stops on him. Talking to Hector is STEP, a short, beady-eyed Charles-Manson-looking guy with a beard and mustache. Step is in his forties. He makes everything he says sound as macho and important as possible.If I don't get home before about 8:00, she puts on the sweatpants and once the sweatpants are on, it's over -- I get nothing. (notices something downAll right. Now, what's the problem? They all erupt in more BICKERING AND FINGER POINTING.Okay! Okay, everyone settle down. Now Mary. Hector here is new okay? It's gonna take him a couple of days, maybe his English isn't so good. You gotta be patient.And Step, if you wanna be Floor Manager, this is the kind of thing you're going to have to deal with.Okay, now Step, Rory, Hector, let's get this cleaned up, and get rolling again. We can't afford to fall behind today. Joel walks away. People resume their posts. Mary starts right back up with Gabriella.Jesus... They're like a bunch of goddamned children.Well, I guess he's got that band he's in too...Who, Mary?Look at 'em... I am so sick of baby sitting these assholes. I better get going... Joel leaves in a hurry, mumbling something about \"sweatpants.\"Please go back inside... Please just turn around.. .Come on...don't notice me...Yeah, actually Nathan, I'm kind of in a hurry here.Yeah, in fact... I should go right now actually. I gotta call the office before they leave.Ah, I don't ah... (realizes his should fakeAh...I'm sorry, I ah... I just don't think that's something we're gonna want to do.Oh, I don't know. Suzie doesn't really like going to stuff likeWell, we wouldn't know anybody there. She get's kind of uncomfortable.I just don't...Um, why don't we talk about this later. I gotta make this call before they leave. Joel pulls away, forcing Nathan to raise off the window sill.Ah, look Nathan, I really gotta get inside and make this call. Let's talk about this another time. Joel has his finger on the button to shut the garage door, waiting for Nathan to get out. Nathan stops, just inside.Man, that Nathan won't shut up.What?It's not the middle of the week. It's Monday. Why can't--I gotta get a house with a bathroom that's doesn't share a wall with the TV.It would look suspicious. We never use those other bathrooms... Maybe if I had some insulation put in...But what do I have really? It's a big pain in the ass.I'm always working; can't stop or the whole place will fall apart. And what good does it do me anyway? I don't get laid. That stock guy with the shitty band that works for me probably gets laid more than I do.Hell, I'd move into a crappy apartment if the bathroom wasn't right next to the TV.I thought you said he wasn't serious; he was just sniffing around.You're kidding.Wow... Joel lets it sink in. He walks over to the window, looking down on the production floor.I could unload all this... I could probably retire...Tell 'em hell yes.(to the person on theWell, he's definitely lost one of 'em. They think they might be able to re-attach the other one, but they're not sure.Yeah... I'm not sure how it happened, but we have a great safety record and we comply with all the safety codes so... it was just a freak accident. There'll be an investigation of some kind I'm sure.Oh yeah. Of course. In fact, he'll probably get a huge settlement.Boy it really makes you stop and think about how fragile we are -- especially our balls. They're just hanging there in a little sack between our legs. At any moment they could be cut off forever.Yeah... Beat.You know Dean, my life wouldn't be much different than it is now actually.Except for once every three months when I have sex with my wife. In fact, I might even be better off...I did? I must've been lying. I don't know... Maybe things'll get better when I sell the company. I'll be around more...Ah, it's all right...What?Xanax? Isn't that for anxiety?No.For what?Are you on something now?Yeah, sure. How is Step?Really? They think it's that big of a liability?No, I guess not.Boy, Step sure is being mellow about all this.Boy, it sure does make you think..Who?Brian, you call everyone here \"Dinkus.\" I don't know who you're talking about.Oh... I thought you call him \"boy- genius.\"You know Brian, you really ought to learn the employees' names.Yeah. She's a temp.No a temp. Quit staring.Hey, I didn't hire her. She came here through Manpower, like everybody else. They just sent her over.Yeah, I know. I guess it makes sense though if you think about it. Hot girls need a job just as much as anyone else.You wanna hear something really weird?She came on to me.Yeah. I mean, I'm pretty sure. I could be wrong, but...I don't know about that.Extract. And spray-dried flavoring, and we're branching outWell, first she started asking me about what happened to Step and all that stuff -- you know, just sort of making conversation?But it really seemed like she was flirting with me, you know?Then, she just sort of asked me out... I think.Well, you see that guy down there by the fork lift? ANGLE ON Rory, the indi-rock guy with tattoos, etc.His band is playing somewhere, at some party this weekend, and she asked me if I wanted to go with her.What? No. No way. I couldn't live with myself if I cheated on Suzie... It'd be nice if I got laid at home once in a while though...Yeah, I do sort of... We see a COMMOTION down on the floor. Mary runs out of the Women's locker room SCREAMING AND YELLING.Now wait a second. Calm down Mary. How do you know it was stolen?Well, what did it look like.I'm sick of it Dean. I'm sick of being turned down in my own house by my own wife. We're turning into one of those brother-sister couples.Maybe things will be better after I sell the company... Or maybe it's just going to mean more time to sit around and contemplate not getting laid. Dean nods sympathetically.Yeah... she was really coming on to me. She gave me her phone number and everything. Told me to call her if I wanted to go to that party. Can you believe that? And there's nothing I can do about it, but just be sexually frustrated.No thanks...No, I can't. I can't cheat on Suzie. I just gotta power through it until I'm so old that I can't get it up anymore.Hmm... I hadn't even thought of that...No. I don't think it would actually. I guess that's weird huh?But see, then I could do something about all this sexual frustration, without feeling guilty about it.Nah...Yeah, maybe.How?What?How do you know a gigolo?Come on Dean.You know, maybe I will try some of that Xanax. Dean reaches down under the cash register and whips out a little box and pulls out a pill.Huh?Ah, who cares?(beginning to slur hisDo you think it would be wrong to do that? I mean morally wrong?I don't know...And this guy, he's a friend of yours? What's his name?I don't know. It's kinda weird even talking about it.Really?Yeah, I guess you're right... I don't know. It's crazy. Dean pours Joel another drink.Alright. What the hell. Joel takes a big swig of liquor.So it's two-hundred dollars then?What, so you're a pimp now?Alright, alright.Wait a minute--Yeah? Brad looks at Joel, deeply concerned.No no no. God no! It's not like that. I won't even be there. I'll be at work. Remember? We already talked about this. Brad looks blank, like he's not getting it.What you'll do, is come to my house pretending to be the new pool cleaner. Then you simply try to seduce my wife. Okay? If she doesn't respond, you simply clean the pool and leave. That's all. It's that simple. Hold on Brad for a long beat.NO! Try to pay attention okay? I will not be there. I will be at work. You come over to my house while I'm not there, posing as the new pool cleaner and then try to seduce her... Brad finally makes a breakthrough.Yeah, that's right.Remember, she might not go for it-- Brad starts to get a little too excited.Are you sure about this guy Dean? He acts like he's never done this before.I don't know. He sure doesn't seem too bright.Oh shit! He runs out of the room.Dean?Thank God you're home. Ah,... did that really happen last night? I mean, did we go through with it -- with that gigolo stuff?Shit! What was I thinking?! We gotta call it off. Right now. Can you call that guy, Brad?Tell him I'll pay him anyway, whatever, just don't come over. God, what was I thinking?!What? I thought you called him last night.Well get it from him again.Shit! I'll try information. What's Brad's last name? Pause.Shit! Joel hangs up the phone, and rushes out the door.Not now Brian.Not now! We FOLLOW Joel as he rushes past his SECRETARY.I can't, I-- Joel stops suddenly.Who?Um, no... He's the ah, pool cleaner. I better take that. Joel goes back in his office. HOLD on Brian, confused.Hello?Yes.What do you mean?What? What're you...? You weren't even supposed to be there for another 45 minutes.So you mean she actually ah... you guys...?No. Tell me. Tell me how it happened.Yeah.Okay that's enough! Stop!I don't need to hear anymore.NO! No. Look, I gotta go. Bye. Joel hangs up the phone and falls back into his chair, in a state of shock.Holy shit.Dammit ! JOEL'S POV: Nathan, the guy across the street is in his front yard, puttering around with the mail.Oh, I'm kind of busy actually.Look, ah, we can't go. Remember?Yeah, but remember, I told you we didn't really want to go to this thing. Nathan looks dumbfounded. Joel is about to snap.Look, I gotta get going.It sucks.Nothing. Suzie looks a little puzzled. They keep eating in silence for a beat.I don't feel well. I'm going to bed.I think Step is just chest-beating. He does this all the time. He gets all wound up, talks big, then he always backs down. And that's with his balls.Oh, hey Cindy. You can just call me Joel.Oh yeah. Right, that's tonight...Yeah, I think I'll probably go.I'm not sure...Um... Okay. Sure.Hi. I can't talk right now--Look Nathan, I gotta... Wait, you mean yesterday, don't you?The new pool cleaner. You saw him yesterday right? Not today.What'd he look like?You sure it was today? Not yesterday?You're absolutely sure?What the hell were you doing at my house today?!Bullshit!Won't charge me for...? You had sex with my wife again?!Not gonna charge...? God damn you! Yes you are gonna charge me! I'm gonna pay you! You're not having sex with my wife for free! And I better not ever catch you anywhere near my house ever again! Joel slams down the phone. Then realizes it's a cell phone, picks it back up and hits the \"End\" button.I can't believe my wife slept with that guy.I guess I didn't really think about it long enough... I just wish it hadn't been so easy for him.No, you're right. He may be a stupid, dull-witted moron, but he can get any girl he wants. Me, I had to work for it. I had to work hard, get a career going, take Suzie out a bunch of times, marry her. But not Brad. He gets to waltz into my house and have sex with my wife just like that. Oh, and by the way? That little prick was at my house again today.Take a wild guess.I'm not going to let him do it for free. No way. I'm paying him.Oh, I don't know. The same, I guess. Why?I don't know... I feel weird about it. Besides, she's at the party, she probably won't be home 'til late.I don't wanna do drugs Dean.I get paranoid when I smoke pot.Oh, wonderful.Oh, I don't know... I'm kind of a light weight. I think that's too much for me--Ah, what the hell. Willie instructs Joel on the bong usage in the same condescending way a weight-lifting instructor would.Umm, I think... no.You know, maybe I should just letWhat? Long pause.Oh, I thought somebody said something. Willie looks at Joel, stone-faced, adding even further to Joel's paranoia. He stares at Joel for a long beat. Then, in an instant, he's right up in Joel's face.Yeah, heh heh...What time is it?Alright. Joel gets the phone number out of his pocket.Oh, she's got brown hair. Pretty hot. Kind of working-class looking...Umm... Oh you know,...Yeah... Beat. Joel's not sure if that was the right answer either.Yeah...I hope I don't wake her up...Yeah.Still busy... Man, what kind of person doesn't have call-waiting.Huh? But... Beat.Oh... You're joking right? Trying to make me paranoid? Joel waits for Willie to start cracking up. He doesn't. He just continues glaring at Joel. We hear the FRONT DOOR UNLOCK. Everyone looks. CINDY enters.I'm fine. I'm fine. I just ah... got my ass kicked. Go back to sleep.It was just... some guy over at Scoreboards.No. I'll be fine. I just want to sleep right now, okay?He isn't returning my calls.Oh, I fell down some stairs.(clutches his headAh... no.No he--!But... Step? Does he even know her?What?!Really?Fire Hector? What for?No. Don't fire him. Just trust me on this. Give him another week. If anything else is stolen, then you can fire him.Okay, thanks.Hello.Uh-huh.He did take a swing at me Dean. Several swings. In fact, he beat the living shit out of me.Yes.I'm not feeling well. I'm going to go home early.Shit! Joel slams on the brakes, turns around, chases Brad's truck down and cuts him off, forcing him to stop. They both get out of their vehicles. Joel is livid.What the hell were you doing on my street again?!(trying to improvise a tough, snappy comeback, but can't quite make itThe same thing that's gonna happen.. Your face is gonna look worse if... GOD DAMMIT! If I ever catch you anywhere near my house or my wife again, I'll have you arrested.What the hell is wrong with you anyway? Do you do this with all your clients -- just keep coming back and hanging around?What?! I thought you were a professional!In love?!Oh, you don't think so \"dude?\" Well did you ever think about this: she doesn't even know that I paid you to have sex with her -- did that cross your small mind?How about I go home right now and tell her? Tell her you did it for the money. How about that loverboy? Brad suddenly looks worried. This really freaks him out.You don't think so? Watch me.Don't mess it up?! You're talking about my wife! My house! Stupid- ass! Joel gets in his car and starts it.Oh yes I can... Joel peels out, drives half a block and turns into his driveway.So how was that new pool cleaner? Suzie is caught off guard -- wonders if she's busted -- but she plays it cool.What do you think I mean?... Did he do a good job cleaning the pool?Did he get all the... leaves? It doesn't really look that clean. I mean I'm looking at it, and I'd say it's pretty goddamn filthy. Did the guy even clean it at all? It sure doesn't look like it.I think he did a horrible job. I don't think we should use him anymore.Okay. Suzie watches Joel leave, a slight look of guilt on her face.No.Yeah, I don't think so. I would've remembered...Hi... Hey Step, can we talk in another room.Oh, no... No, I'm just kind of curious about... ah... So you've been going out with Cindy, huh?.so some of the guys at work are saying you gave Cindy that black eye.Yeah, I know it's not.Hmm... Look, you might wanna be careful with Cindy.Well, I'm not sure how to put this, but... You know, you got a lot of money coming your way with this settlement. You might wanna beYou sure about that?Yeah...You sure about that?Oh. Hmm...Well, okay... If you say so. Another thing -- you just might want to watch your back. Some of the guys at work who think you gave Cindy the black eye were talking about paying you a visit -- you know, getting even.Huh?Oh shit... Alright. Joel drags himself out of the chair.What!!!? We don't have this much money! Not even close!What the ff-- Are you shitting me!? That would bankrupt us!If you think I'm just going to give up this entire company that I built from the ground up-- Adler jumps up, dripping with phoney, forced indignation.It was an accident!I don't wanna slam my testicles in the door! I want you to be reasonable! You won't even budge one penny! Come on!I'll slam your balls in the door!I don't need this. I'm going home.Yeah?... What? But they are ill-prepared. No one knows who should talk first. It's incredibly awkward. They all look at each other and mutter things like, \"go ahead\" \"you first\". Finally...You know what? Fine. Fine. You're all in charge -- all of you. (gestures to all theYou banged the pool cleaner.That's what you're trying to tell me right? You had sex with Brad?Yes I knew. I hired him.I don't mean I hired him to clean the pool, I mean I hired him to have sex with you.He's a gigolo Suzie. Suzie is stupefied.I hired him to have an affair with you so that I could have an affair without feeling guilty. I was really drunk and on some kind of horse tranquilizer and--FIFTEEN TIMES?! Jesus Christ Suzie! Joel sinks into his chair, shaking his head.I only paid him once -- well, twice. The rest was on the house. Long beat as Suzie tries to let it all sink in.Yes. But I didn't. Suzie paces around for a moment, reeling, processing all this. Then, decisively,Oh, I'm the asshole?Okay. I'll admit, I made a big mistake. I was drunk, on drugs, stressed, sexually frustrated and I shouldn't have hired a male prostitute to seduce you. But if you had simply been faithful, none of this would've happened. Suzie just looks at him for a beat.What do you see in Brad anyway? He's borderline retarded. You probably could've been arrested for having sex with a guy that dumb.No. You're not leaving me. I'm leaving you!I couldn't kick your ass if I wanted to. You're a good 10 years younger than me, and I'm a pussy. So why don't you just leave me alone.Why'd you have to get hung up on Suzie? You could have any girl you want.You had her fifteen times.Well... You told me.Hey Brad?... Brad stops.I don't know... Maybe come by the office tomorrow. Fill out an application. I'll see what I can do.So I don't sell the company, don't get the money, I'm bankrupt, I don't get Cindy, I paid a guy to have sex with my wife, and she actually did it...Nothing.Hi.Ah, actually, I'm staying here too. Down on the first floor, around the back. I thought I saw you so I ah...No thanks. Cindy comes back in with a Diet Coke.That's Mary's purse... Isn't it?Right there. That's Mary's purse.That's Mary's purse. You stole it, didn't you?I've never seen another one. You probably have Sylvia's wallet in here somewhere too, don't you? And everything else that's been stolen from my employees.No, I'm not. That's Mary's purse Goddammit! Okay? Everyone blamed Hector. He almost got fired. Doesn't that bother you?Hector! Hard working guy, never did anything wrong. And what are you doing with Step? You're trying to screw him out of his settlement money aren't you?Yes you do! You're the only reason he's suing us aren't you? You know how much work it took for me to build up that company? You just don't care about anybody do you? What are you, some kind of sociopath? Cindy looks like Joel might be getting to her.You can't even admit that you stole this purse can you? You just can't do it.In fact, you probably can't tell the truth about much of anything, can you?... Cindy turns away from him, looking down at the floor.I bet Cindy's not even your real name is it? Who are you? Where the hell are you from? Cindy, still looking away, doesn't answer.You can't answer can you? Because if you said one true thing, you'd have to tell the truth about something else and then it would all unravel wouldn't it? Then you'd have to admit that you stole this purse and God knows what else. Beat. Cindy still looking away, down at the floor. We see her eyes well up, about to cry, but Joel doesn't notice.And I'm taking this purse with me. If it really is yours, you can call the police and tell 'em I stole it... In fact, I'm gonna call the police and report it... Joel walks towards the door. Then Cindy slumps down on the couch, mutters something, still looking down at the floor, her voice cracking slightly.What?Well... Maybe you should've thought about that before you started ripping off my employees. Joel starts to open the door.How do I know that?Hmm... I guess that ah... Do you have Sylvia's wallet, and Jim's watch? Can I get those too? Beat. Cindy nods, still looking down. Joel considers it.Well... Okay then. I guess that works.So what's your deal anyway?... I mean, how did you end up like this? Joel finally looks over, notices that she's crying. He's caught off guard..Ah... Cindy? Cindy breaks down and starts bawling.Okay, now you see... that's what I'm talking about. You're trying to manipulate me now, and I'm not gonna fall for it... Cindy starts bawling even harder.I really hope you're not faking this right now, because I'm feeling really bad. Are you faking it? Cindy shakes her head \"no.\"I'm sorry, I was just curious, you know, how a person ends up like... this... Cindy suddenly starts BAWLING hysterically. Joel stands there awkwardly, not sure if he should hug her or comfort her in any way.Never mind. I'm sorry... Joel tentatively puts a comforting arm around her and she leans in to him, crying on his chest. He puts his other arm around her and she snuggles in even closer. As her crying gradually subsides she snuggles in even more. Finally, she lifts her head and they start kissing. As they get hot and heavy weCindy? He looks around, realizes he's alone. Then suddenly looks worried.Oh shit! He scrambles for his pants, then looks relieved as he realizes his wallet is still there. He sets down the pants, then after a beat, picks them up again, checks inside the wallet and sees there's still cash and credit cards. Then he looks up at the chest of drawers and sees: Mary's purse, Sylvia's wallet, and a watch, placed side by side. He lies back in bed, and shuts his eyes, grinning again.Here you go Mary.And by the way, Hector didn't take it. Cindy did. Joel walks off. Mary just shakes her head at him. She whispers to Gabriella.Really? Bring him in.Hi Step...How you doin'? How's your, ah...Well... that's good. They both sit down on the edge of the dock.Wow... Bummer...Yeah, he sure is.Yeah... I'm beginning to think I might be the same way... I'm a little worried about what I'd do with too much time on my hands.Yeah,... I think I do a lot worse.You don't have to bankrupt the company.Well, maybe I don't have to sell the company... You know I've been thinking; all these years I've been building this company, dreaming about the day I could sell it and retire, but what would I really do if I retired? It's like that old saying -- it's not about the destination, it's about the journey? Step just stares at him blankly, he lost him.I guess what I'm saying is, too much free time might not be such a good thing -- like that old saying, idle hands are the Devil's playground? Step's never heard that one either.What I'm saying is, I'm thinking maybe I won't sell the company...that is, if you dropped the lawsuit. -- and remember, you'll still get that insurance money -- probably a couple hundred thousand. What do you think?What's that?Deal. They shake hands.Hold the line! Mary shuts off the conveyer belt.Okay, listen up everybody. I've decided not to sell the company... Gasps and murmurs among the employees.And I'm making Step the new Floor Manager. More gasps and murmurs.And if anyone doesn't like it, I hear they're hiring over at Gemco... But just remember, at Gemco, the owner doesn't know your names; you never even meet him, he's at an office up in Chicago somewhere and you get an auto- response if you try to email him to complain about anything. Here, you can come up to my office any time you have a problem. Thanks. Joel walks off. Brian catches up with him.It's about the journey Brian. The journey. ANGLE on Mary. She and Gabrielle start right back up.Hi... You doing okay?I heard you were right there when it happened. That must've been rough.It's okay, it's not your fault... It's not your fault. Suzie's crying subsides a little.Yeah, I know... I know... But we probably won't. It'll be alright. Suzie starts to regain her composure. They stand there for a beat.You wanna go get something to eat... or something? Beat. Suzie still sniffling a little.Here...Maybe we should've been married in a Church like that one. Instead of the Botanical Gardens.Yeah, but... a church just seems more -- I don't know -- official.I don't know... So, are we still married?I mean otherwise.Alright. They walk for a beat.You know, this is really bad, but... Oh never mind.Well, as I was looking down at Nathan there, I was thinking... That's the longest I've ever seen him with his mouth shut.

I don't even go into the front yard anymore. That wife of his is even worse.We gotta get a new pool cleaner.I don't think that asshole checked the chlorine levels again like I asked him too... Joel puts his arm around her, caresses her shoulder. She doesn't seem to notice as he starts getting fresh..and every time he is here, he goes on and on about some problem with the goddamn filter, and I have no idea what he's talking about... Delayed reaction -- she notices Joel is getting frisky. He gets closer, starts kissing her neck.I'm sorry. It's just... I'm a little tired, and, I don't know, it's the middle of the week...Monday? (Freezes, suddenlyIdol! Suzie jumps up with newfound energy, runs for the remote and turns on the TV. Joel just sits there.Sorry honey. Maybe this weekend. Joel leaves the room.Thanks.No. It's ours.Oh, thanks. Beat.So... How's work?Really? What's wrong?Oh my God Joel, are you alright? What happened?What? By who? What happened?Let me drive you to the hospital. You need to get checked out.You sure you're okay? It looks like your nose is broken, and yourOh hi. You're home early.Um... What do you mean?Ah... well--Okay.Are you all right, Joel? You want an aspirin or anything?No Brad, we can't. I'm sorry, but we have to stop doing this.It's not right. I feel horrible. Besides, I think Joel's getting suspicious. And you gotta start cleaning the pool too.Ah, yes it does.Because of all the things I just said.No.No. Look, you gotta go Brad. Joel could be home any second.(just trying to get rid ofListen Joel, there's something I have to tell you. I think we need to be honest with each other. Suzie sits down.I'm not sure how to say this, but -- well, you've been so caught up in you're work lately, and I'm here alone all day and sometimes I just--Wha... Suzie is stunned.You knew?Well I know you hired him, but how did you know about--What?But... what... Why? Joel is so fed up, he just tells her everything.Brad was getting paid?... So you've been paying Brad this whole time? All fifteen times?!You wanted to have an affair with another woman?You asshole.Yes! How could you?None of this would've happened if you hadn't hired him.You're sick, you know that? Beat. Joel can't really argue this point.That's it. I'm leaving. Suzie heads for the door. Joel follows after her.Fine. Joel opens the door, about to storm out, only to find NATHAN, standing right there about to ring the doorbell.Now's not a good time Nathan. Joel turns around, storms off back into the house.No. Look, we can't talk right now.Now's not a good time.I don't know.Okay tomorrow.I don't know. Just come by tomorrow. I can't talk now.Yeah, Okay... Suzie shuts the door, cutting him off.Yeah, didn't work out.Yeah.Look Nathan, Joel and I aren't going to that dinner okay? Nathan acts deeply disappointed.Joel never agreed to this Nathan, and neither did I.Okay, let me be really clear with you then. When we say \"I don't think so,\" or even \"I'm not sure,\" that means \"no.\" Why can't you understand that?Shut up! In fact, let me be even more clear with you. We don't like you! Is that clear enough? You're dull, you never shut up, you never listen, and we don't want anything to do with you ever again! Nathan freezes, in some kind of state of shock. He starts to shake a little. Suzie just keeps going -- it feels too good to stop.Is that clear enough for you Nathan?! Is that...? Nathan starts to go into some kind of seizure.Yeah, I'm okay.It was horrible Joel. He came over to ask for that check, and I just... Suzie breaks down, starts CRYING..I just lost it. I started yelling at him. I said horrible things. He had an aneurism and I probably caused it.It could happen to any of us Joel. Any of us could have an aneurism. We could die at any moment.Yeah, okay. Sure.Thanks. They walk a little further. Joel looks at the Chapel nearby.I thought you liked the Botanical Gardens?You think it would've made a difference?Well, legally yes.Hmmm... We can talk about it I suppose.What?Joel!

You've got three of 'em.Insulation?... All I know is, you shouldn't move man; you've got a nice house. I mean you've got the American dream really -- you own your own company. I can't believe you used to bar back for me here, and now you've got all that.Yeah, but he probably lives in a crappy apartment.Wow...Well, you have insurance for that kind of thing, right?Yeah. I would think so. I mean, it's your balls... Beat, as they contemplate the profundity of it.Yeah. And your balls are really important man. Your balls are everything. What kind of life would you have with no testicles? Can you imagine that shit?Wait. Three months? I thought you said it was once a month.Well, I hope so. That would suck... I get laid all the time. Sorry.Yeah, sexual frustration is bad news... You know what you oughtta do?Get some Xanax.Yeah it is, but I find it's good for just about any phsychological problem. I mean, basically it just makes you feel good, so it sort of works for anything. I even take it when I have a cold. It's probably great for sexual frustration. Want me to get you some?You know what else is good? Codeine cough syrup.It's just good. Joel looks at Dean for a beat.No... Well, I guess I took some Vicodin this morning. But that was just 'cause I was hung-over.Hey man. What's goin' o-- Whoa! DEAN'S POV: It's CINDY, now working down on the floor, on the assembley line.Damn! Who's she? Is she new?She's a tramp?Damn, she's hot! Way to go.Manpower, huh? Maybe I should give them a call. You don't usually have girls anywhere near that hot working here. What's the deal?Do they really?... Huh... You just don't see 'em here. Usually your temps look like winos. And they're guys.What?No way! Really?Hey, I'm sure she did. Are you kidding? You could have any girl down there.I'm serious. Dude, you're the big shot here. You're the king of... What do you call that shit you make here again?Yeah, you're the Extract King man. You could have any girl here. I mean, I wouldn't want most of 'em, but her... Way to go Joel. Dean looks down at manufacturing area, taking it all in.So how did she come on to you?Yeah.Really? How?Wow. So, you gonna do anything about it?Man, she is fine. You mind if I hit that then? Beat.Huh...Now that you mention it, you guys kind of look alike too.Okay.What about that girl at work? She still into you?I've got some Xanax if you want it. Like I say, that always works for me.Well maybe you should call that girl.What about if Suzie cheated on you?You wish she would cheat on you? Wouldn't that bother you? Joel thinks about it.Yeah, it's a little weird. Sort of.Do you think she would cheat on you?You sure?So you're saying she would probably cheat on you if she was put in temptation's way?You know what you oughtta do?No, no. Check this out -- If you really wish your wife would cheat on you, it's not that hard to make it happen.Hire a gigolo to have an affair with your wife.I'm serious. I know a guy.Yeah.This guy Brad. He comes in here all the time. He's a friend of Vic's. You could hire him to have an affair with Suzie.Why not? You said you wouldn't care if she cheated on you. Then you'd be free to go out with that Cindy chick and get your ya-yas out -- with no guilt. Problem solved. Man, what a great idea. Joel just shakes his head at the whole thing.Shit... Do you remember what color that pill I gave you was?Damn. I don't think it was Xanax. I think that might've been Ritalin... Or \"Special K.\"It's just that, ah, Special K is a horse tranquilizer, kinda has a weird effect when people take it but... well, don't worry about it... You might not want to drink too much more though.Yeah?Oh nooo. Definitely not. What could be morally wrong about it?Look, if she doesn't want to go for it, she doesn't have to. And if she does, then she's the one who sinned, and then it's perfectly morally right for you to go out and boff whoever you want.Brad. You want me to give him a call?Look, this is no big deal Joel. I'm serious.Yeah. I mean, you can't lose. Just say you're hiring him to come clean the pool or something. See what happens. If she doesn't go for it, then at least you know you're doing the right thing by being faithful.Look. Have another drink. Think about it... You know what? Why don't I just call Brad and see what he has to say?Well yeah, but don't forget, I'm getting ten percent.Two-hundred and twenty.Referrals.Networking.Okay, you've said that a few times now Brad. Go on to your car. Okay?Goodnight Brad.Let me drive you home. You're in no condition to drive. Joel stumbles into Dean's car.Oh no. He does it all the time. Don't worry. He just gets a little excited sometimes. He's cool.Yeah well, what do you excpect? He's a whore.Ah, yeah. As far as I know.Okay...Sure, I'll call him. No problem... Oh wait a second. I don't think I have his number.Yeah, but I got his number from Vic.Vic doesn't have a phone right now.Hmm... it's something like,... I think it's a Mexican name.Yeah, I thought it was weird too -- a guy like that with a Mexican last name... It's like Lopez, or Sanchez or something. Joel looks at his watch. It's 11:15.Well... I thought you said it wouldn't bother you.Yeah, I'm tellin' ya, chicks really go wild for that Brad... Sorry.No shit? What was he doing?Wow... You pay a guy to do a job, then he comes back and does it for free.Really? How much?Hmm... So should I get my twenty dollars from Brad then or... Joel shoots Dean an angry look.We can worry about that later... Look at the bright side, now you can call Cindy.You know what you need to do?Look, I know I joke around a lot, but this time I'm serious. You should try smoking a little pot. It's just an herb, it heals. Stress can kill you, and--Not when you just smoke a little. Come on. You ever meet my friend Willie? Great guy. Really great guy. He's the guy I got that horse tranquilizer from.I've been reading about it -- they're making technological advances now, coming up with great drugs that can make you happy and won't leave you with a hangover or nothin'.Come on Joel. Don't worry, this stuff isn't that strong.He gets paranoid when he gets too stoned. Joel looks at Willie then at Dean, then takes the bong, partly out of being intimidated by Willie.Huh? Joel's POV: looking from Dean to Willie. Willie sits there with red eyes barely open. Willie turns slowly to Joel.Hey Joel, why don't you call that chick now?It's twelve thirty. She might be back by now.Alright. At least you know she's home.Well, it looks like you guys got a lot to talk about here so I think I'm just gonna go ahead and take off. Later guys. Dean bolts. Willie moves in closer on Joel. Joel starts to leave, but Willie blocks him.Hey man. Sorry I bailed on you like that last night. It's just that I don't like to get involved in other people's personal shit, you know what I mean?I didn't even know Willie had a girlfriend. She must be new. Man, Willie looked pissed.I thought he was gonna take a swing at you there for a second.Whoa, really?Wow. Man, that really goes to show you -- this town is smaller than you think.
