Let everybody see this bullshit.This is the auto-biography of the E, and if you ever fuck with me you'll get taken, by a stupid dope brotha who will smother, word to the motherfucka, straight outta Compton.What the fuck did you DO!?We don't even have passports. Check the source.What up with Doc and Suge?Cube's record's in the Billboard top 20! Our shit never even came close to that. He's blowin' the fuck up --We gotta keep Dre happy. Keep him motivated.Yeah I get it. He drownin' in pussy. But that don't mean --We done with this shit now?Thanks, Jerry. I'mma go fuck now.That's what I'm talkin' about. Cube ain't shit.That's why we gotta go hard at him. We gonna look like some bitches if we just take that shit.Man, why you gotta be drunk all the time? Get your shit together.Only the special ones. Actually I've never been here before, but I heard it's good. High as it is, it better be.Excuse me, Miss Record Executive.Stop it, Jerry. Relax man. Niggas don't know what anti-Semitic means - - It's just a battle rap.I heard it, Jerry. You deal with it your way, I'll deal with it mine. All we got to do is hit the studio and end this boy career.Who you see sitting in the big chair mothafucka?!Least they got it on video. LAPD gonna have a real good time on that level 3 prison yard, know what I mean?So, what'd you wanna see me about? Sounded all worked up on the phone.Is that seriously the reason you wanted to talk? I thought we were past all that --You know why you rich, Dre? You know why you live in a big ass house and don't sleep on a couch no more? Do you know why you fuck the finest bitches? That's Jerry, dude. He broke us through the door. He made this shit happen, and you wanna turn on him just like Cube --You think that's right, turning your back on somebody? After all he's done for us?Thought you were mine, too.Man, fuck Dre.Why don't y'all ask him.That nigga quit. So nah, he ain't comin'. But fuck it, we gonna keep this shit movin'. Don't need that punk anyway...Hello?Talk to Jerry.Where the hell is Dre? You said he'd be here --Whatever homie. You think I'm signing that shit, you crazier then I thought. I'm out --Fuck you, Suge. I ain't scared of none you niggas, cuzz!The fuck is that supposed to mean?Dirty mothafucka...I gotta kill that mothafucka, Suge. I just wanted you to know that shit's about to get thick around here.I didn't come over here to ask you - - I came to tell you.You the one that wanted to be down with this gangsta shit. So here we go.I have to do it! This is the streets, muthafucka! I don't have a choice! He came at me! He came at us. We don't hit back, it's over! Done! Put a fork in this shit!I don't care about the money, Jerry. Ain't about the money.Yeah? How you figure?Do you really believe that bullshit? All I know is Cube's doin' big things, makin' movies and shit. And I keep hearin' about this album Dre workin' on --Sorry? We all ought to be sorry... We had them on tape -- we had their asses on tape.Havin' some cash flow problems. They can smoke it, they can sell it, I don't care. As long as it keeps 'em off my back for a minute.What, makin' pornos? No thanks, man. That's your thing. I'll stick with this music shit. Once my new album right here's done, I'mma be fine --Yeah. Just tired. All this shit, downsizin' to a new crib, just weighin' on me. I'll figure it out though. I always do.I'll come when I can, Jerry.I feel like I don't know what I'm doin' anymore. I don't even know where the money's going.Okay. After New York. Workin' on that International Distribution with Sony. Jerry don't know about that. I wanna keep it that way.Relax everybody. Just came in the club-- heard you were over here.I don't need shit. Out here with Bone Thugs-- Was just in the neighborhood. Wanted to say wassup.Saw your movie. It was good.Missed you, boy.Guess it all happened like it was supposed to. You a movie star-- I'm a music mogul. Dre. Well Dre is tripping right now, but he's doing his thang. Just wanted to come over here and put something on your mind..I wish all that bullshit never happen between us.Definitely never wanted it to get physical-- we should've kept it on wax.Yeah you right. Ever though we was going to be this big?Me neither. I'm still trying to figure this stuff out. One minute I'm slangin' in a crack house -- next thing I know, they invite me to the White House.You ever think about fuckin' with some new NWA shit?Me too, Cube. Been thinkin' about it a lot. Be like 1989 again. We changed the world forever. Mothafuckas can never go back to that fake shit after us. It gets no realer then NWA. No matter what...I hear you.Naw, I'm cool. I wanna walk.I'm good. Hit me up later.I'mma take these home with me. I'll sign 'em. Get'em back to you in a couple days.It's cool, Jerry. They're my bills, my checks. I mean look, my name's right there.Don't worry so much, Jerry. I can handle it.Cube tried to warn me. So did Dre. And I didn't listen. I fucked up.This ain't about Tomica, Jerry. It's about you. And you really gotta stop acting like you never did anything wrong.Jerry, for real? You can stop givin' me advice. As of, like, now. I'm getting NWA back together. It's happening. But you ain't gonna have nothing to do with it this time.Trust. God damn, that's a word. Let me tell you somethin', Jerry. Trust is a muthafucka.You're fired, Jerry.Just felt like callin' --You know. Doin' my thing. Makin records. Killin' all that pussy out there.How about you?That Snoop record you did was big. 850,000 copies in the first week?! Congratulations on the success of that.Well look, I know you're busy, but I talked to Cube, and we were, like, talkin' about some... possibilities.And by the way, if you ain't heard-- I ain't fuckin' with Jerry Heller no more. Nigga's fired.Listen man, I know everything got messed up and went the wrong way. I wish it didn't. I wish we can go back to the days of Skateland when we were all just young, hungry and ferocious. The world's most dangerous group. Before all the money and fame got between us.So you think maybe, we can make somethin' happen?Fair enough.Everybody's all in. NWA is back!I don't know. Hopefully soon. Let's just get ready. New NWA gonna change the game, just like back in the day --Yeah. Just. Like. Need some fresh air, somethin' --Get the fuck outta here.But I ain't no faggot.It's wrong. No way. Test me again. Test my shit again --Tomica. She's pregnant. Oh fuck. Does that mean she --So what do we do? What's the treatment? Let's get started.I got work to do. How long's it gonna take to get me healthy again?But I don't even feel that bad...Comfortable? What you mean comfortable? Six months!?Just glad you're okay. You and the baby.Yo.Put it on the table. I'll listen later. Thanks for stoppin' through. Hit you when I get outta here.Please. It's gotta happen, baby. I'm having my surgery tomorrow, so it has to happen now. Because I might not. Wake up.It's true, Tomica. I gotta make this right. Ron says it's the only way to protect everything I built.Hey. Listen to me. It doesn't matter what people think. They don't know. They don't understand. There's no other way. Please.

I'm just tryin' to learn how to make some of this white people money.Where Dre at?What you mixin'?Ohio Players and the Headhunters..? That's the shit!You know it.Stayin' a while?Man that mouth always gettin' you in trouble. We got that in common.Damn straight.Ain't worried about all that. I'mma come with it.Nothin'. Just goin' home --How you figure we in a gang? `Cause we black?Yo watch my notebooks!Officer, can you please explain why you jackin' us?It's a car. A `64 Impala.Gankin's when somebody jacks you. Ain't a big deal. Just sounds better that way.Fuck you then. Wearing a Kangol don't make you L.L. Cool J nigga, remember that.What you wanna do, mark ass nigga?That ain't it...You kickin' me out?Aiight. I'm just sayin'...Homie, I got rhymes for days. But I got to hear this one more gen...Dre, hit that shit.Aww damn-- here come The White Shadow.And you trust this dude? Cause he looks like a one of my old muthafuckin' history teachers.Yeah, I trust you. But that ain't what we talking about --Yo Dre, kick in the bass!It was once said by a man who couldn't quit --The Dopeman said Cluck I don't give a shit, if your girl kneels down --I'm still trippin' that they knew all the words! That's Crazy...We talkin' about the power of N.W.A. and all you saw tonight was pussy?Ice Cube, `Sup?Them little-ass raisins on the commercial? Singin', \"I Heard it Through the Grapevine\"?I appreciate that, man. Eazy what's up with our deal.Aww shit, here we go again...Yo!Yeah, fuck the police.Ain't that some shit... Talk some truth and people lose they minds.Straight outta Compton, crazy muthafucka named Ice Cube, from a gang called Niggaz With Attitudes. When I'm called off, I got a sawed off, squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off --Indianapolis in the muthafuckin' house!Meet y'all upstairs.What's the deal on them contracts, Jerry? I'm still waitin' on 'em...Yeah me too. I just like to know what's goin' on. Since I wrote a lot of lyrics on this record.Shit's pretty good. Someday, huh?Know what don't make sense? Eazy chillin' with Jerry eatin' steak and lobster while we at Mickey D's. That shit don't make sense.Never told y'all, but when I was twelve, my sister got murdered by her own husband-- A fuckin' wanna be cop who couldn't make it in the academy. Life changed for me that day. Everything became serious--Check this out --\"... advocating violence and assault is wrong and we in the law enforcement community take exception to such action.\" Have they ever heard of freedom of speech? What the fuck can they do to us?If it was from the LAPD, then I'd be worried.I guess freedom of speech don't mean shit.Are we finished, man? We got a show to do.Yo hold up, hold up -- Y'all know what the muthafuckin' po-lice just told us back stage? They tired to tell us-- what the fuck we can't say-- what the fuck we can't play!Put ya middle finger in the air!This NWA -- We do what the fuck we wanna do! We say what the fuck we wanna say! So, all I wanna tell that cop talking shit back stage is -- Yo Dre, I got something to say!FUCK THE POLICE COMIN' STRAIGHT FROM THE UNDERGROUND. A YOUNG NIGGA GOT IT BAD CAUSE I'M BROWN --My art is the reflection of my reality. What do you see when you go outside of your door. I know what i see.And by the way, the hood gets AKs from Russia and cocaine from Columbia.WE must of struck a nerve.Hell no. Last I heard, this is America and we got Freedom of Speech. Pretty sure that includes rap music. Exercisin' our Free Speech across this whole damn country, openin' people's eyes. Far as I'm concerned that's our job.Well I can barely see you, Jerry. What's with all this Godfather shit?It's your company too, right? You and Eric. All for one, one for all.Alright, cool. So I can take this one, show it to a lawyer or somethin'?But I have no idea what it says. At least let me take it to show my family.Jerry, you know I can't understand this legal shit. None of us can. That's why we need to show it to a lawyer--What the fuck..?Damn. Thanks, man.That's my money anyway, Jerry. I earned it. I wrote a lot of hit songs. I been on tour for months.Performing. Gettin' arrested and shit. And you gonna try to gank me?Give me my money, Jerry.Why all this now, Jerry? Back in the beginning, if you thought we were so good, why didn't you just give us contracts then?I'm gonna ask one more time. Are you sayin' I can't have the money I earned, unless I sign this contract, right now, without showin' it to anybody?Bye, Jerry.Y'all signed that Ruthless contract without a lawyer?Hell naw I ain't signin' that bullshit. Don't y'all think it's a little fucked up that Jerry won't let us show it to nobody? That seem honest to y'all? If he offered us seventy-five thousand, he probably owes us double that. Thought we talked about this, dude?At this point, Eric and Jerry in this thing together. Believe dat!Naw man, not like this. I'd rather be broke then get fucked -- Why did you sign that shit, Dre?Yo, I get it. Everybody gotta do what they gotta do. They're gonna take care you. You they're bread and butter.Nah, we NWA. They Ruthless.How you doing? My name O'Shea. What's yours?Hey Kim-- You the best thing I've seen all day.You believe in love at first sight?Yeah, I'm tired of the games. Eazy puts everything on Jerry and Jerry puts everything on Eazy. They can have it.Well get ready-- `cause these albums are gonna be comin' real fast. I'm hungry and I got a lot to say that's gonna fuck the world up.If I can't get the best producer in the in the west. I gotta go get the best in the east.Kickin' shit called street knowledge. Why more niggas in the pen than in college? Now cause of that line I might be your cellmate. That's from the nigga ya love to hate.I'm just tellin' you what you told me. If Amerikkka's Most blew up, you'd advance me for the follow-up. That's what you said.Come on, Bryan. I don't even know what that means.Man, I got a kid on the way -- and I just bought a house on the strength of what you told me. You gave me your word.It's like this shit keeps happenin' to me, no matter what I do. When people do the work, they should get paid. Why you making it seem like I'm begging for some shit that's technically mine?But you can't help me. That's what you're sayin'.Shoulda kept your word, Bryan.What you got, Bryan? I know you called me up here for somethin'.Benedict Arnold.I'm a traitor!? I didn't say shit about NWA on Amerikkka's Most Wanted! But now they're trying to diss. Okay.I can't wait to get to the mothafuckin' studio!God DAMN I'm glad y'all set it off. Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft. First you was down with the AK. And now I see you on a video with Michel'le. Lookin' like straight Bozos. I saw it comin', that's why I went solo.Yella Boy's on your team so you're LOSIN'! And yo, Dre? Stick to producin'. Callin' me Arnold, but you Been-A-Dick. Eazy saw your ass, and went in it QUICK.Y'all disgrace the C-P-T. `Cause you gettin' fucked out your green by a white boy, with No Vaseline.... So don't believe what Ren say, cause he goin out like Kunta Kinte. But I got a whip for ya, Toby; used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me --You little maggot, Eazy E turned faggot. With your manager, fella, fuckin' MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella. But if they were smart as me, Eazy E would be hangin' from a tree. With no vaseline, just a match and a little bit of gasoline. Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on. Til that Jheri curl is gone. On a permanent vacation, off the Massa plantation. Heard you both got the same bank account -- Dumb nigga, what you thinkin' about? Get rid of that Devil real simple: put a bullet in his temple. Cuz you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew with a white Jew tellin' you what to do --Fuck'd y'all say!?What? I thought this interview was about the Rodney King trial?I'm not Anti-Semitic. I'm Anti- Jerry Heller. Let me ask you a question -- do they condone Jerry's behavior when it comes to my situation? Him trying to get me to sign a contract without legal representation?Well, you get me that answer and then we can continue on this topic. Until then, let's talk about the beating of an unarmed motorist -- Rodney King and the trial of 4 guilty L.A.P.D. Officers who seem to be Darryl Gates' standard issue -Come on, man. That don't even make no sense. Black Korea is just a warning. That's it. I'm a journalist, just like you! Reporting on what's going on in the hood. But the difference is that I'm brutally honest about it. Cause sugar coating will get you diabetes.There my brothers. That question alone just proves how unprepared of a \"sandbag reporter\" you really are. You wanna talk about Anti- Semitism? Then it's \"Black Korea,\" and now you wanna talk about the Nation of Islam? Seriously, man. What's your agenda? You can't focus on one thing? Ask me something interesting. I'm not an elected official. I'm an artist. You haven't asked me one damn question about music. I'm America's conscience. I represent the good, the bad and the ugly. What you represent?Hey Darrell. What you been doing? -- playin' with Shea?Damn... We left some good records on the table...All the time. But we've been feuding for so long. It might be \"ON\" on sight when we see each other. I really don't know.Yeah-- When it should be bring us together. Somebody always wants more then they're suppose to get. As that's when shit get funky.Heads up y'all. This lil nigga might wanna do something.Yeah. I'm over here. What you need?Thought you said it was an after- school special.Missed you too, E. Wish we could've work shit out.Never should've dissed each other in the first place. Made our fans choice between us. That ain't cool.Nope. I was reminiscing with my wife the other day. What it felt like-- In the beginning. We were so young and ferocious. Doing music straight for the hood. Trying to be ghetto stars... I thought I knew everything back then -- But I didn't know shit.Yeah. I get it. Everything changes so fast. Feels like it was 20 years ago. If we were still together do you know how large we'd be?I'd be lyin' if I said I never thought about it.If you can get Dre to do it, I'm in. But check this out homie-- I ain't doin' it if Jerry's around. He done made enough off us.Cool. We done talked til the damn club closed -- I got a car coming. You need a ride back to your hotel?Walk? It's cold as fuck Eric, this ain't L.A.S'up Dre?You see him? How he look?Can't see him like that, man. This is bad.

meet you. Would it be possible to have a word with you, Eric?I thought your record was good.No-no-no, hang on. I thought it was exceptional. Please, sit back down.Let's try this again. As a music manager, let me tell you what I can do for you, Eric --You think because I don't have some flashy office, that means I don't know what I'm talking about? Elton John, War, Styx, REO Speedwagon --Let me tell you what I see. Lotta raw talent. Lotta braggadoccio. But if you think anyone's gonna talk to you, if you think anyone's gonna let you into the building where you might talk to somebody -- somebody who matters -- you're crazy.That's what I do for you. I will make you legit. I will take you into that building. I will protect you. I will block out all the noise of this business and we can build something big.But you're gonna have to believe in me like I believe in you. If you don't think you can do that...You got more music for me?Good, cause you're gonna have to follow this up. So what does N.W.A. stand for anyway? No Whites Allowed?Try not to look so scared, Bryan. They smell it on ya, you're finished.Relax. You're in for a real treat!So what do ya think?That was quite a show, gentlemen. Nice job. Very, very nice.This is Eazy E and NWA. Guys, this is Bryan Turner.Uh, Bryan runs Priority Records. He wants to sign you.Yep, almost platinum. Bryan has a great distribution platform.Our deal with Priority is done. I have the contracts for you to sign.If this music keeps sounding like this. This album is going to be amazing.The lyrics you're writing is really good, Cube.The lawyers just started drawing them up.Excuse me officer, what's going on out here?!These are not thugs, they're artists!They're rappers working in the studio right here.I'm the manager.This is only the tip of the iceberg, fellas. The days of selling records out of your trunk are a thing of the past, Eric.Are you crazy? Had a enough of that shit in the 70's. I'll fly out a couple of times and check on'em.Excuse me.What ya got in there, Mr. Wright?Have you lost your mind? You are not taking that on the bus.I'm not gonna let you take that arsenal on tour, Eric!Another one called-- said she was pregnant by you too. Eric, you gotta slow down. You can't fuck'em all...Yeah well, you start making a little money, problems come with it.Money problems are race neutral. But I'll help you through all of it. I'll put you in touch with --Evening, Cube...It's all right, Eric. Cube's right to ask, and I'm remiss in not updating you guys. Contracts are being finalized as we speak. Truth is, attorneys will bleed you dry going over `em. Wish I was paid by the hour...Everybody knows how important you are, Cube. Just give us a little more time.He wants to be you so freaking bad. This kid has issues. At some point, you gotta trust somebody...Moving up on the Billboard 200 albums chart, Holding our bullet the R&B, Hip-Hop chart. I mean, you have any idea how many records we're selling? Ruthless has arrived. Eric, we are huge!It's a warning. A message to our record label about \"Fuck the Police\". We should really think about not performing that song for a while.Relax. RELAX. No need to worry-- All I'm saying is, we should be aware of this threat...Well, uh. If that's what you wanna do, then maybe we --You have no right! This is illegal! You can't do this --What the fuck were you guys thinking? They can hold us libel for inciting a riot! No one cares that the police started it...Whether you like it or not, you are a political group. Never give these assholes a reason to hurt you. Next time they might take it.It's nice to see you, Cube.I know you've been very eager to sign a contract with Eric's company, Ruthless Records.That's incorrect. It's not my company. I work for you. I've made that clear from the beginning.Cube, lawyers get paid to make trouble. That's what they do -- create problems where problems don't exist.I can assure you, it's all standard. You can read it now, if you like.Cube, I thought you knew? Everyone else signed already. You're the only one who hasn't.Look. Cube. This is a great thing. This is what you always wanted your whole life. And there's also this.Soon as you sign this contract, the money is all yours.That's ridiculous.You're kidding me, right? Who do you think pays for everything? All the hotel rooms, the parties, the transpo? You think that's free?Nothing's a sure thing, Cube. Even a great talent can crash and burn. Too much ego, too much excess, too many expectations -- it tends to ruin things. You oughta keep that in mind.It's gonna be fine, Eric. It's not just NWA anymore, it's our whole Ruthless roster.We've got D.O.C., we've got Michel'le, we've got Above the Law. We're moving up to the next level.Look at him. You think he needs anymore motivation than that?You gotta stop worrying so much. Let me do the worrying for you. Fact is, Ren can write just as good as Cube. Maybe even better. Come over here a minute --Need your autograph on these checks and a few other things. Just sign right here --We're done.We'll sue that worthless fuck. Defamation, libel... That anti- Semitic piece of shit, I'm gonna call up my friends at the J.D.L. and we'll see how he likes that, little bastard. Eric, come on, we gotta get organized here, we gotta fight --I always knew Cube was a rotten human being. And people are gonna know the facts. I'll make sure of it. I can't believe you're not as angry as I am, what's wrong with you? Didn't you hear what he said?Well call Dre and you guys go do it!Help you with something?Who's asking?Who are you? Are you with Suge Knight? Someone else? Ice Cube?Just need a word with Dre --Jesus Christ, Eric. You can't just... I thought you were --Are yo okay? Eric. Why don't we go inside? All right? Come on...Hey. You gotta tell me what's going on. I can tell when something's --You're not gonna do that.You do that, it's gonna ruin everything we've built --Eric. Listen to me. I never said we won't hit back. But this isn't Compton. We don't hit back with bullets. We do it with lawyers. We drain those assholes.Of course it is. You're smarter than those criminals. You wanna kill somebody? Then you'll be in prison, forever. No more family. No more Ruthless. No more anything.If you kill this man. His problems are over and yours are just beginning -- Lets hit 'em where it really hurts.We're about to get back into the game in a big way, Eric --Are you just trying to insult me?Did you forget about Ren's album? Or the fact that you're working on an album that I believe is gonna be bigger than anything NWA ever --Dre's a fuckin' producer, Eric! Producer's don't rap! It's never gonna work! Period!Eazy. You may wanna see this.Sorry...Eric --Can you come by my office? I need you to sign some checks --Eric --Wait, aren't you gonna sign --But this is how we've always done it. You have a lot on your plate Eric, there's no need to add to it --I just wish we could do it here. I don't want anything to get misplaced or lost --Where the fuck have you been? I've been calling you --So what was it, the groupie? The executive assistant? Did she even go to college? Come on. You're smarter than that, Eric --Look, I know you're upset. But I'd strongly advise you to take a breath, let me look at the paperwork --Why would you say something like that? You're not thinking straight.I know what's best for you, and for Ruthless, and we've built a trust over years of hard work. That trust is our foundation, Eric.Are you okay? You don't look --Look, if what I've done is so illegal, why have I never been sued? I'm such a thief, such a liar, such a motherfucker, how come nobody's come to collect? This is business. This is how it works. It's not always pretty, but all of it, everything I've put into this company, my whole LIFE for all these years, it's for you, Eric.Goddammit, Eric!
