{"Basic": {"HARDY": {"raw_line": "Tell the truth, Vic. You made these with a blender, right? He grins and we get our first good look at TOM HARDY - Three day stubble, dark rings around his eyes, but a with strong jaw and steady voice. Not your average barfly. Somebody who maybe used to be somebody.You know that was like a quadruple negative? The Bartender takes the plate away from him.Can I at least have a drink?Yeah, if you've slept.Don't you mean \"don't need no liquor license not taken away from me\"? The Bartender smiles.Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going. He stops, his attention suddenly on the TV. A NEWSCASTER:Bill Styles...Old friend. Haven't talked to him in- 911. Can I use your phone? The Bartender hands him a cordless and Hardy dials.Hey, Bill, it's Tom. Long time no. . . whoa, whoa, slow down. Yeah... yeah, of course I'll come. An hour. He hangs up and hands the phone back to the Bartender.I gotta go out to McKinley. EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- MORNING Establishing. A sprawling five square mile compound nestled in the Louisiana backwoods. Also damaged by the Hurricane. HELICOPTERS loaded with emergency supplies land and take off, REPAIR CREWS work feverishly on damaged buildings, all while CADET PLATOONS complete morning drills around them. This is still a boot camp after all. SUPERIMPOSE: 1130 HOURS - FORT MCKINLEY BASIC TRAINING CENTER EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- MAIN GATE -- MORNING Styles stands waiting nervously just beyond the CHECKPOINT with WARRANT OFFICER JULIA OSBORNE - early 30's, attractive, close cropped hair and icy eyes. In the middle of protesting.How are you?What kind of trouble are you in? Styles looks at the ground. Momentarily flustered.That bad?Tell me what I can do.And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on? INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS MORNING Hardy follows Styles and Osborne. They pass SOLDIERS replacing broken windows and sweeping up glass.It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West. Styles' look tells him it is.Ah, ChristHe was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.Well, he's a good soldier. Osborne nods, agreeing.I didn't mean that as a compliment.And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore. They round a corner.And the problem is you only got three.I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?And I'm the closest thing to it, right? Styles stops, turning to his friend.I'm not gonna let that happen. Styles exhales, relieved.Gotta be honest, I love what you've Done with the place-He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording-Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne? Osborne opens her mouth to reply but Hardy cuts her off.Three things. First - You don't have a choice. Second- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third - I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.Levi? Who names their kid Levi-Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone-He's in interrogation?Move him.Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?Is Dunbar cute?Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight - these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute? Osborne stares at him. She finally nods.Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.Something like that. She starts to go make preparations.Oh, and Osborne? You have any donuts around here? INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDOR -- MORNING As two M.P.'s escort RAYMOND DUNBAR intoCadet Dunbar, good morning! I'm Tom Hardy and I believe you've already met Officer Osborne. I understand you had a rough time of it last night? No response. Hardy takes a seat across from the cadet.Not talking, huh? You probably just want to get some food and some sleep. They feed you yet? No response. Hardy reaches into his pocket. Pulls out aGo on. You can eat in front of someone and still not talk to them - my parents did it for years. Dunbar grabs the donut, wolfing it down.Want another one? No response. Osborne looks to her watch - it's been a minute.Maybe later. Ray, let me say this up front - I'm not a cop. Dunbar turns away, no longer interested. Hardy continues:I used to be, but that's beside the point. Who I am doesn't really matter; what matters is that right now, you're in a shitload of trouble. You understand that, right? No response.Now, I don't know if you did what you did in self defense and frankly I don't really care. I'm just doing a favor for Colonel Styles because he wants to know if anyone else who's still out there is in need of assistance. To be honest with you, though, I don't care about that either. Dunbar looks up at this, surprised.I don't know those guys, you do. They die, to me, it's like seeing a couple people died in a fire on the news - tragic, but it doesn't affect me. The only thing I care about is I agreed to do a favor for a friend and try and talk to you till your transpo shows up. You like baseball? No response. Osborne looks at her watch - two minutes.I could talk baseball for days. Batting averages, ERA's, I got statistics in my brain, I don't know how I remember them. It's freaky. You wanna talk baseball? Dunbar, completely confused.Come on Ray, we're gonna be here five hours, we gotta talk about something. So who do you like? A long silence and then:Why not?You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.What do you like then? As they continue, we TRACK under the table to reveal a HIDDENC'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here. INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNINGFifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'dknock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns? He Dunbar nods.I was also his \" knife dummy\" . See, West used to say he could slit a man from stem to sternum in three seconds. He'd use this length of pipe to demonstrate and if you were the knife dummy, you'd spend all day getting a pipe rammed into your balls if you weren't fast enough to defend yourself. That was a loooong day. Hardy laughs at the memory and turns back to Dunbar.Incidentally, Ray, I promised them I'd ask where West and the others are. Can we get to them? He looks to the floor.They're dead, aren't they? Dunbar looks back up at Hardy.You kill them? No answer. Hardy rubs his nose. Osborne steps forward.See, Ray, this is what we call \"good cop, bad cop\".She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established. Osborne, stunned by this.But I don't want to play games. That's why you're not in an interrogation room, with one of those two way mirrors - everyone knows those things are two way, right? Dunbar looks at him good nods slowly.Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?Believe somebody owes me ten dollars-Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop - by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.Yes- They stop, looking at each other.Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like - nice guys? Dunbar takes a deep breath.Tell me about them.That's not exactly true... I'm living proof. How did you get Sectioned, Ray?And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?You smoke, Ray?No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some. Dunbar studies him for a moment and then pulls a pack of Dorals from his pocket and puts them on the table.My brand. Must be my lucky day.Let me ask you one thing. You seem like a good guy, Ray. You carried Kendall wounded to the pickup. So what I don't get is what you did to make Nunez want to kill you? Dunbar just looks at the ground. A KNOCK at the door. Hardy and Osborne turn to see an M.P. stick his head in.He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him-Why'd you join the army? Osborne looks at him, annoyed.You're right. We should sit in silence.Best time for banal chit-chat. He slips something into his pocket.Microrecorder for Kendall - didn't have- time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck. Osborne smiles in spite of, herself.You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.I lost a bet. Osborne laughs.Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out. Osborne studies him.The very same.I plan to grow on you.So noted. They pass an OVERTURNED CLIMBING TOWER.You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.He's telling the truth, up to a point.Being back here. Gives me the willies.No. INT. BASE HOSPITAL -- RECOVERY UNIT -- DAY A NURSE leads Hardy and Osborne down a spotless white hall.It is.Got it. INT. BASE HOSPITAL -- KENDALL'S ROOM -- DAY Kendall lies in a bed, a network of tubes in his arm. He is awake but pale, still weak. He studies his visitors.Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk. Kendall's laugh turns into a cough. Placing Hardy.Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us. Kendall smiles again, not losing any of his cool.But not the only victim, right?It's too early in the day for me to give a shit about some pissant cadet's bad version of \"intrigue\". You want to talk to us, send word over to the brig. Let's go. Nonplussed, Osborne follows. Hardy turns back at the door.You're working too hard, Levi. I can tell cause you're sweating. And you're sweating cause you have no idea what Dunbar's already told us. INT. BASE HOSPITAL -- CORRIDORS -- DAY Hardy and Osborne walk to the NURSE'S STATION.Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight. He pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights it.I lied. Wait for it... Osborne just stares at him, not knowing what to say next. The PHONE at the Nurse's Station rings and a NURSE answers. Listens for a moment, hangs up, and turns to them.We're on our way.Sergeant West is dead isn't he? Kendall nods.And the other three Cadets? Kendall hesitates, then nods again.Feel free to elaborate . Kendall takes a breath and begins, all trace of bravado gone.Senator Daddy must be thrilled.I think you just blew \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" out of the fucking water.More intrigue, Levi?Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called \"motive\" and you just gave yourself one.What happened to \"degrees\"?Then who did? INT. ARMY TRANSPORT HELICOPTER -- LAST NIGHT On Kendall, sitting among the Sectioners in silence. terrified he looks like he's about to throw up.But you didn't.Because Childs is the one who shot you. Osborne looks up, surprised. Kendall nods.He admitted it.Why did he come back for you?Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.\"Too neat.\" How long have you been an investigator?That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me - murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people - it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy.Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have Tried harder to witness it for you-There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.Okay, then let's widen the search 'to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car-From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.You mean not enough to save you.Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy. Kendall - seems you killed three people!That'd be my reaction too-Well, why didn't you say so? We'll Just drop all your charges, then-Fuck \"you're serious\", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you-Yeah, we know, Pike did. Dunbar stares at him.I know enough to know you got two choices - you can sign a confession, in which case you'll probably spend the rest of your life in a military prison, or you can tell us to fuck off, in which case you'll probably get the gas chamber. Am I scratching your surface yet? Dunbar stares at him for a moment and then LAUNCHES HIMSELF at Hardy, SCREAMING. Tackles him to the floor, CHOKING HIM... Osborne, pulling her sidearm, and PISTOL WHIPPING Dunbar in the head! Dunbar goes sprawling off Hardy as M.P.'s rush into the room, RESTRAINING him. Hardy gets up, gasping, and stumbles to the door.Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?Home, I'm done.You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault-I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has- Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend-You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.Watch me.West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.Phenomenal at taking bribes, right? A beat. Osborne shakes her head.Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my \"great second chance\", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here-Why do you care?I didn't shoot West...Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body. They stare at each other for a moment... INT. COFFEE ROOM -- DAY Hardy and Osborne enter to find Dunbar in SHACKLES.You saw West's body.And he'd been shot.Tell it to me. INT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- LAST NIGHT Dunbar and Nunez RUNNING towards the glow of phosphorous and sound of GUNFIRE. They come over the hill to see Childs and Kendall, standing over WEST'S BODY. Dunbar stops, shocked.Kendall told us Mueller was the one who found them with West's body.What happened next? Dunbar shudders.You shot Childs and Nunez.You saved Kendall's life-Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story-And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.Kendall maybe would have agreed, but The hurricane buttfucks the cabin-And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.That bugs you too?Let's go talk to Bill... INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- DAY Hardy and Osborne stand in front of an agitated Styles. He tries to take a hit off his asthma inhaler and gets nothing. Frustrated, he tosses it away.What I said before-Yeah.Dunbar's confession. It should be enough to get you out of trouble. Styles looks at it and then slowly up to Hardy.We know. Styles nods and looks to his desk. Almost to himself:You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar-Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?My heart weeps. He returns with a GLASS OF WATER and hands it to Kendall.Is it the truth?Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life-Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said \"Dunbar was gone,\" My fault, I gotta check the tape on that. Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie. Silence. They wait for Kendall's reaction. He looks momentarily flustered by this... and then he smiles.Well?Dunbar will testify that you were.We're fucked, I know-What?Are you sure?Something funny, Levi?Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not-That's a fantastic idea-Why?How do you know?Little advice, Levi, next time you frame a guy, pick someone who can't defend themselves. Kendall says nothing.Childs did it, huh? Kendall nods, still a little teary.First Pike, then Mueller, now Childs? When are we getting to the others? When are we gonna hear about Nunez? FLASHCUT TO - NUNEZ, in the creek bed, SHOOTING WEST.Or Dunbar? FLASHCUT TO - Now DUNBAR, SHOOTING WEST.Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him? FLASHCUT TO - KENDALL, SHOOTING WEST.But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies! Kendall, crying harder now, beginning to shake.You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!Where are they!MAYBE WHAT-Shit!I pushed him too hard.Yeah, I could've. Should've.No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.Yeah.That's horseshit and you know it.I wouldn't know where to start. I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings. Styles nods, understanding.They're taking your command, aren't they?I'm sorry, Bill.You're a good soldier, Bill.This time it is. EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- EVENING The sun, beginning to dip in the sky, as Hardy and Osborne exit the hospital.Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.Nah. They pass a GROUP OF CADETS doing drills. Hardy, watching them. Almost looking wistful.It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up.That's gonna stay my secret. INT. MOTOR POOL -- EVENING Hardy and Osborne make their way towards Hardy's car.Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries. I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?Good, just making sure. Osborne turns to the DUTY SERGEANT.Hate to be the bearer of bad news, Sergeant, but he didn't make it.Why not?What runway's that transport leaving from?Get in. EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- EVENING CADETS SCATTER as Hardy's car ROARS OUT OF THE MOTOR POOL, PEELING across the grass towards the far side of the base! Hardy, white knuckling the wheel, doing his best to steer around anyone who can't get out of the way in time. EXT. FORT MCKINLEY RUNWAY FOUR -- EVENING A Large TRANSPORT PLANE sits on the runway waiting as three M.P.'s and a JAG LAWYER lead Dunbar/Pike out to it.We're not finished yet-James Randall Pike, COME ON DOWN! Dunbar stops at the hatchway. Slowly turning back to them. Seeing the gun. The M.P.'s release Hardy. Nobody moves.Right back where we started.No more games, right, Pike? It was you who West singled out...You who got hooked by Mueller's morphine...You who did it all.You wanted revenge on West, revenge on them all, so you killed them.But that wasn't enough. You needed a new identity, because no one was going to believe James Randall Pike, convicted felon, had acted so nobly in the face of danger - you needed a name people could trust, one that hadn't been to jail, one that hadn't publicly been West's bitch boy.You walked into the army a convicted felon with a sentence of five years in a uniform and were going walk out eight weeks later with a different name, a clean record, and an honorable discharge - a guy who did \"everything he could\" to save his friends. Dunbar looks at them. One to the other. Slowly.We don't need the tapes-We've found all of them.Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun-Isn't this how your story goes? Pike annoys someone so much he gets shot in the head-We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you-WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?Do what?What did you do?Goddammit, what did you DO?!And the bodies?No death certificates. No crime.Not even close. They leave. Styles walks over to Hardy.Seven. He takes a slug of his drink.Seven guys. What was it you said? You were \"just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said\". He chuckles.This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.Tough. He pours himself another drink.Thing about taking money is, you don't have to do anything. You just sit there. Maybe you don't return a phone call. Maybe you don't follow up a lead. But that's it. Keep the money, your work's done. Osborne stares at him.Seven unsolved murders. And you know what? It didn't weigh on my conscience. Not one goddamn bit. He takes a slug from his glass and grimaces.There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.Really.I may not be growing on you, but you're sure as hell growing on me. He motions to the bartender for another glass, but Osborne takes his hand, stopping him.West?Do I have a choice in this?Fuck it. Let's go finish this. INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- NIGHT Styles, finishing his paperwork. He rises and turns off his desk light, bathing the office in DARKNESS. He's about to leave when he notices a SILHOUETTE in the doorway.\"You have to get out of the way of the bigger dogs\". That was good. Styles squints at the figure.It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this. Styles, realizing what Hardy's talking about.Stay where you are.West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital - you're the only other person who visited Kendall.You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it-Not for long. He walks towards the desk.No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.Get your hands away from the desk! In the darkness we see Styles MOVE SUDDENLY...Osborne, gun! Hardy DIVES to the floor - Osborne in the doorway, PISTOL raised, FIRES TWO SHOTS! Muzzle flare lighting the room for a split second as Styles is BLOWN BACK against the wall! Hardy gets to his feet and flicks on the LIGHT. Styles lies slumped in the corner, two holes in his chest. Dead. Osborne lowers her weapon, shaking. Hardy points to the top desk drawer, which is open. Inside it sits an IVORY HANDLED PISTOL. Fully loaded, safety off. It's presence tells them everything they need to know.Now it's over. EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- NIGHT The aftermath. Flashing blue and red lights from parked Military Police vehicles illuminate the grounds as M.P. 'S string crime scene tape around the front entrance of the building, securing the site for investigation. Hardy takes in the entire scene from afar. Standing by his GTO, watching as several M.P.'s finish questioning Osborne. When she's done she spies Hardy and walks over to him.Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?Think it'll work?Want company? Osborne smiles.I should probably write that down.In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you. A beat.Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks. She nods. An awkward moment. Finally:I'll see you. He turns away. Walking towards his car.You saved my life tonight. Keep it. Actually, don't keep it, I need the money. He takes the bill and Osborne laughs. He climbs into his car and starts it. Grinning at her through the open window.You're one of the good ones, Osborne. Don't sweat the details. He puts the GTO in gear and drives off. She watches him go, then looks down at his card. Smiling. Maybe she will call. INT. OSBORNE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT A bottle of Scotch at her side, Osborne slips a tape marked \"BASIC TRAINING INTRO - SGT. N. WEST\" into her VCR. Settles back to watch it. West's face fills the screen.Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray? The Hitchhiker is Dunbar.How about this? And with that, Tom Hardy emerges from the brush carrying, a COMBAT KNIFE. West's eyes sparkle with recognition.Stem to sternum. You taught me well, Sarge. And WEST DIES. A moment of utter silence and then VOICES FROM THE PAST begin coming back to us:I wouldn't know where to start. Kendall holds out his arm, gritting his teeth...I guess it was about one man framing another...When you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy.. .And for that to work, you have to have a witness...Someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned...You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe...And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the world. INT. OSBORNE'S APARTMENT -- PRESENT NIGHT Osborne, watching the taped West.My brand. Must be my lucky day. INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- EARLIER Kendall, coughing fit. Hardy, getting him a GLASS OF WATER.We got the toxicology report . . . INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- EARLIER Hardy, confronting Styles in the dark.Next time you frame a guy, pick someone who can't defend themselves... But it will not be in vain. Sometimes, you can trick the enemy into doing your work for you. . . Osborne, staring down at WEST'S PISTOL.He still carry those guns? INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- EARLIER Earlier. Alone, Hardy plants West's pistol in Styles' desk.What I can't understand is why you signed these... As we move into a CLOSE UP on Hardy:I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...He's telling the truth up to a point...You can't prove anything until we find the bodies...WHERE ARE THEY?Murder is basic. Focusing on the TRUNK...There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings. INT. GTO TRUNK -- NIGHT WEST'S BODY, stuffed into the trunk of Hardy's car.Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne. EXT. CLEARING -- THIS MORNING Dunbar lays the wounded Kendall down as the Helicopter carrying Styles comes in for a landing. Dunbar wipes the sweat from Kendall's brow and asks him seriously:", "clean_line": "tell truth vic blender right grins good look tom hardy day stubble dark rings eyes strong jaw steady voice average

The two old friends embrace.You can get us some answers. Hardy takes off his sunglasses, noticing her.Hostile and uncooperative.You knew Sergeant West?Sergeant West's served for twenty- Three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...You and the Colonel go back.You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall-Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour - the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.Yes.Why?Excuse me?That is the most unprofessional-Good cop/bad cop?I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.Go. INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNING Dunbar looks up as they enter. Hardy smiles, cheerily.The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, You're a murderer-Baseball?You made me look like an idiot-No-Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.Epilepsy.You really want to make banal chit- Chat like that now?We're in the middle of a murder case-What is that?Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.Something like that. You?You're kidding.I bet that's the second story you tell the girls to get them into bed, after you make them laugh with the first one. Hardy just smiles.This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?You're off to a late start.Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?What point? Hardy doesn't respond, instead looking out as they pass theNot the happiest of memories? FLASHCUT TO - FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. A bunch of young Cadets, Hardy and Styles among them, doing forced push-ups by the barracks in the rain as West randomly berates and KICKS THEM. BACK TO HARDY - As he looks away and shakes it off.Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.We just want-That was kid gloves?But we have to question him- Thought you didn't have cigarettes-He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.He said what?No one else heard it?Why? No reply. Hardy smiles, understanding.Why would he just surrender? Kendall turns to her and smiles.Nunez was chasing Dunbar.But you didn't see it, right?It's too neat.I don't think that has anything to do with-I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies - he didn't see any crime committed.He said he worked there-What business?Hardy! But he's already gone. INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS -- DAY Hardy, walking angrily towards the front entrance, wheezing and massaging his neck. Osborne, runninq to catch up.I don't know.Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave-You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him? Hardy whirls on her.You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal-I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone Said. I guess I was wrong-But you will. Hardy stares at her.Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that. We can do this, Hardy.Two and a half hours. That's all I'm asking. Two and a half hours to maybe get the truth. Silence. Hardy looks back up at her. Speaking softly:What?Where?What about the phosphorous grenade?Mueller was alone in the cabin?At least you and Kendall agree on that.Yeah... yeah, sure. She goes over to the machine and pours a cup.Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?Where's the cabin?Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or ho hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.Dunbar.They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the Cover story-Buttfucks the cabin?So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?Little bit.Yes, sir, I do. Hardy lays a piece of paper on Styles' desk.He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved. Hardy nods, agreeing. Styles stares at them.We know.Pike never confessed.Fifty minutes.Pike never confessed.Dunbar says you were.I need to talk to you outside. EXT. BASE HOSPITAL -- CORRIDOR -- DAY Osborne and Hardy, exiting the room. Whispering:They got their stories straight.What Kendall said - \"the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around.\" That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.Positive. Hardy, they planned this. She grins. He grins back.Not bad for hostile and uncooperative, eh? INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY Hardy and Osborne reenter, smiling. Kendall chuckles.Good idea.You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're Going to jail-It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon-See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission-It will and you know why?Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off! She finishes, breathing hard. Kendall, totally cowed. Hardy, trying to suppress a smile. Osborne rises for the door.Enjoy your flight to Washington-What. Silence. Kendall takes a deep breath.Wrong answer-Who killed Sergeant West? Kendall stares at the recorder. A long pause.Who, Levi-So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike. Kendall nods. Crying a little.What happened with Nunez?That's how you do good cop/bad cop. Hardy smiles and gets up. Walking slowly to Kendall's bed.Get something between his teeth!He's an epileptic!He's a witness!He's trying to say something-You couldn't have known-You wanted to get the truth.You mean the falsely accused? Hardy looks up at her and nods.You wanted to break him.So did I. She looks back to the floor. Hardy takes a drag from the cigarette, and then tosses that away too. The door opens and Styles walks into the room. Somber.What happens to Dunbar now?Your car's in the motor pool. I'll walk you over. They walk in silence, for a bit.So what now?Think it'll work?You know, you never told me why you left the army.For what?We were close to something with Kendall.No.We're going need a vehicle release. The Sergeant nods, walking up with a clipboard.Yeah.No, no that was Cadet Dunbar-So?Four-We need to talk to him-We need to talk to him now. Hardy grabs Dunbar by the arm.Let's go have a talk. INT. COFFEE ROOM -- EVENING Hardy and Osborne roughly lead Dunbar into the room, the JAG Lawyer trailing behind, shouting:Fuck off. She slams the door and BARRICADES it. Turns to Hardy.We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself-How do you know that?Hardy, what are you doing-Hardy, for Chrissakes-You mean the exercise?No bodies, no West...We need to talk-What?This isn't the time-What if I don't want it?That's not true.You're a good man, Hardy.Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past. Hardy stares at her.And because you're a good man, I know you'll do the right thing. Hardy looks at her, questioning. Osborne takes a deep breath.Pike never made it to D.C.. Somebody took him off the plane before it left. My guess is he's already dead. Hardy stares at her.Nobody saw. But I don't think so. She puts the papers on the bar.These are the requisitions from the PX, the ones used to release the drugs to Mueller. West signed half of them - Pike was telling the truth. Look who signed the other half. She taps the bottom of the paper. Hardy, not wanting to believe it. He looks up at her, pained.Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.It's West's, isn't it? Hardy nods and then turns to look down at Styles' body.What are you doing out here?Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.Nah.A word of advice about women - that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.Yeah. . Hardy pulls a card from his pocket and hands it to her.Your phone number?He was your friend.Hey, Hardy! He turns back. She walks up and holds something out to him. A ten dollar bill.I owe you this. He looks down at the money.They got their stories straight. . . EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- LAST NIGHT 24 hours ago. The hurricane rages. A HAND pulls the PIN on a phosphorous grenade and CHUCKS IT. It blows, frying brush and nothing more. West comes over the hill, running to investigate. He stops at what he sees. Nunez stands unarmed in the creek bed, SURROUNDED by the other Section Eight Cadets. A prisoner.They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent. EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- EARLIER After shooting Styles, Osborne gives her story to the M.P.'s.You never told me why you got kicked out of...", "clean_line": "totally unnecessary guy called army army official

Hardy grins as Osborne stops her watch at 2:41.I asked for a policeman.It's... too slow.I just don't like it.I don't know... I like the Army.You did Basic here?There's no need...Yeah. INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- MORNING Styles lowers his head at this. INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNINGOkay. Hardy smiles at him, gets up, and leaves. INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDOR -- MORNING Osborne follows him out into the hall where Styles waits.I'm not telling you what happened.Some.First day was when I met Pike. Sarge hated him from the beginning.Sir, Dunbar, sir!Sir, yes, sir! West draws one of his PISTOLS and gives it to him.Sir, yes, sir!Fifteen guys quit that day. But not Pike. EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING The CADETS, navigating a log spanned over a PIT OF MUD.Time went on and the Sarge started singling people out. One of the Cadets, a small man named ANDERSON, falls from the log. Screaming, West dives into the pit and pulls Anderson out, knocking him on the head with a pistol. EXT. TARMAC -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- AFTERNOON Anderson stands naked, his arms straining to hold up,TWO PAINT CANS perpendicular to his body as West berates him.He'd zero in on a fella and ride him till he quit. EXT. MAIN GATE -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- NIGHT Anderson, now in civilian clothes, gets into a TAXI. Quit. EXT. FIRING RANGE -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING West, screaming at a weasely looking cadet named CHILDS.Those who wouldn't quit, he'd put in what he called Section Eight. INT. SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- NIGHT A horribly dilapidated quarters. Four cadets, Dunbar, Pike, Childs, and MUELLER sleep in rickety bunks.Washout rejects, guys he said were , \"dumbfucks too stupid to know they were dead\". He separated us from the rest. We slept alone.... . .ate alone.. . EXT. REGULAR BARRACKS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- EVENING The four Cadets fallout on a run shirtless, with heavy packs and rifles held over their heads as the rest of the Cadet Corps files into their barracks for sleep. DUNBAR ...and trained long after the other guys got to turn in. EXT. PARADE GROUNDS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING The Cadet Corps, mustered. West zeroes in on NUNEZ , whose t-shirt has a spot on it.Fellas lived in daily fear of being Sectioned and with good reason, too. West pulls Nunez out of line by his ear and kicks him over towards a separate muster of our Four Section Eighters.They figured we were the boys who'd meet with a \"training accident\" . Nunez takes a place among them. Looking absolutely terrified. INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY Osborne leans forward.No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.There were six of us... EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE.-- ONE WEEK AGO -- EVENING The six members of Section Eight on a forced run through the rain. We focus in each face as Dunbar describes them. First up is MUELLER a tall Aryan looking blonde with a square jaw.Mueller was from Tulsa, a real good ol' boy type. One of those \"his Daddy's Daddy's Daddy died at Bull Run and no bleeding heart Yankee was gonna take away his scatter gun\" . He idolized West. Muller, grinning, as West kicks his ass to pick up the pace. Next to him is NUNEZ, a strapping hulk of a manchild.And Nunez idolized Mueller. Big fella from New Mexico. After he got Sectioned he just followed Mueller around like a lap dog. He wasn't mean like Mueller, though, didn't have it in him. Next to Nunez is CHILDS, small and weasely with feral eyes.But Childs did. Didn't talk to anyone, but you got this feeling something was wrong with him, like real wrong. Type of guy you felt uncomfortable going to sleep near. Behind Childs runs Pike.Pike I told you about. He took the brunt of it from Mueller and West. Once they found it out he was a convict they were merciless.He'd been busted for Auto Theft, judge gave him the option of jailor the Army. He made the wrong choice. Next to Pike, Dunbar and KENDALL run side by side. Kendall is short like Childs, but also weak. Wheezing.Finally Kendall and me. Kendall was a smart guy, we got along okay. Pike and I tried to help him, but... Kendall falters and Pike stops to try and help him up. West smacks the him away, practically kicking Kendall to his feet.He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week. INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAYThis is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.He's right. We don't have a choice. EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- TARMAC -- LAST NIGHT The six cadets, mustered in front of West and a TRANSPORT CHOPPER. West hands out M-16's, sidearms, and grenades while yelling above the wind.We finished the course and came here, Then heard an explosion- Where's Pike?What do you mean, alone?He wouldn't kill anybody. . .I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him!Shut up. Let me see your grenades.We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one. Mueller angrily digs into his sack and pulls out his grenades.Whose blood is that, Jay? West's.What do you mean, West's?That son of a bitch.He's lying.I'm serious- Hardy leans across the table.Did Kendall tell you about the PX?No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain-Didn't shoot West-You think you know everything, don't you? You haven't even scratched the surface. Hardy leans across the table, looks Dunbar dead in the eye.Apologize-Of course-The creek bed-Yeah-One went off, yeah, but it didn't Touch him- I thought you knew this-Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?He's lying, then. We didn't see Mueller till we got to the cabin. INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT Dunbar, Kendall, Childs, and Nunez push through the door to find Mueller in his undershirt, a FIRE burning in the hearth.West...he's dead.Yeah.So did we. Why didn't you come?I didn't buy it. But Mueller had all three of his grenades.Pike came back.Where have you been, Jay?Shut up. West's dead. A beat.Where have you been, Jay? Pike, suddenly understanding. Fear creeping into his face.We just want to check your pack-You know it's not like that-Tie him up. INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT Later. The fury of the storm has increased. Kendall, Childs, Nunez, and Mueller, in the KITCHEN looking for food.Yeah... Pike takes a deep breath.You hated West more than any of us.You're the only one missing a grenade.If not you, then who?Oh, come on-That's exactly what he says about you.You hated West, Mueller loved him-Bullshit.Why?You're lying-Why... why didn't you tell me?That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.Full clip to the body-His chest was hamburger-They?I... I don't know...This is a lot of information to be Getting... I have to think-No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s-Don't do this- Pike, EYES LOCKED with Mueller. Continuing:Put it down!So you killed him?You too?Can I have some coffee? Osborne blinks, like a trance has been broken.They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.But not Pike's. Osborne hands him the coffee.Would you have believed me? Their faces say \"no\". Osborne spreads a MAP out on the table.Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this - I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die. EXT. FOR MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS -- DAY Hardy and Osborne, walking and talking.You wanna bet?Sorry, detectives. Time's up. As the M.P.'s grab Hardy, dragging him away. Osborne, trying to stop them. Dunbar, climbing the stairs onto the plane... Osborne pulls her SIDEARM, levelling it at him as Hardy yells:You want to talk about baseball now?Can't do that now, though, can you?Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me? He reaches under the table and rips out the HIDDEN MICROPHONE.Check your tapes. Hardy and Osborne exchange an uneasy glance.Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?Ohhhh, I don't think so...Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus - no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives ... you have nothing.Jesus!Please, please don't-You'll never find it-You'll never find it cause HE'S NOTHe- He made me do it-Hunting- we had to hunt him-There never was an exercise! Never targets, never teams, I don't even know if there's a creek bed out there- As the M.P.'s grab Hardy and Osborne, pulling them away...You're right. I was the one he singled out. Beat me morning, noon, and night, ran me ragged. When Mueller found me, I was gone. He gave me a little taste... INT. CADET SHOWERS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO Mueller showing the syringe to the naked Dunbar. Dunbar's voice over speaks in unison with Mueller:What I didn't know, was his friend was West. He ran the whole thing.You think it's easy to have all that morphine just disappear without a higher up authorizing it? Check the requisition orders, I'll lay money it's his signature on them. INT. SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO Dunbar, alone, sleeve rolled up, arm tied off: Sliding the needle into his vein...That was his game, see? Ride the cadets so hard they'd need something to stay on their feet. Then he'd send Mueller or Kendall to them, waving around their magic needle promising to make it all go away. He hits the plunger, injecting. His face goes tranquil. INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT EVENINGIt wasn't a new thing either. He'd been doing this for years.Every nine weeks, a new class of cadets, new potential customers. The amount of money involved over that period of time... this was some high stakes shit. He takes a deep breath, looking at them.Dunbar moved his through the kitchen. I worked in the motor pool and hooked all the mechanics. By the time the hurricane hit, we were all in. Some using, some pushing, some both. But then something happened. West heard one of us was about to talk, to blow his whole operation. He figured he'd made enough money, had enough of the army, maybe it was time to disappear. But first he was gonna teach us one last thing. INT. SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS -- LAST NIGHT West, entering the,barracks, shouting the cadets awake.The Tuesday Night drill was the perfect cover. The hurricane made it even better. EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- TARMAC -- LAST NIGHT The cadets, climbing aboard the chopper.He put us on the chopper and flew us to his cabin. And then he told us. INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT The six men stand in rigid formation, eyes on West.It was insanity. We were hunting a man down to kill him.He got Mueller first. Nunez TACKLES HIM at full speed, feet SLIPPING on the wet hill, and the two TUMBLE head first into a GULLY. Punching, kicking, biting, anything to stop the other man.He took his gun. Used it on Childs. Nunez spins, seeing CHILDS BEHIND HIM. He DIVES as Childs fires! Hits the ground in a roll, comes up with Mueller's rifle, and SHOOTS - BLOWING CHILDS BACK against the wet rocks.I can't imagine what it was like. Having your friends try to kill you... Nunez slumps against the gully's wall, breathing hard. In agony over what he's just had to do.But you do what you have to survive. Closing his eyes, Nunez steels himself. Wipes the blood from his hands and climbs out of the gully.Kendall and I found Dunbar a couple minutes later. TIME CUT TO: Dunbar and Kendall come upon Pike's fallen form. They gaze down at the uniform emblazoned with the name \"DUNBAR\".It came to me in a split second. Change clothes, change identities. If James Pike gets discharged he goes right back to jail. But if I was Dunbar, I could walk away from all this with a new life. But then... As he reaches down for the uniform, a SHOT RINGS OUT.I just want to go! Nunez shakes his head.I have to get Kendall to a hospital!We don't have to do this! You go that way, I'll go this way! Nunez laughs.You killed three people! Isn't that enough for one night? More silence. Neither moves. The sky above, a maelstrom.I don't want to die out here, Roberto! Do you? Nunez, staring at him. Deciding.Forgive me. .. And Dunbar FIRES. Nunez, caught by the burst, GOES DOWN. The echo of the gunshots, swallowed by the storm. Dunbar lowers his head in agony. West walks down.I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance. You know the rest.You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good.Just four people MIA. Silence.I don't want any deals.All the proof you need will be when West comes back and puts a bullet in my brain. But I'll do it. I'm a dead man, anyway. Like Kendall. We both should have died out there with our brothers. I know that now. Silence. The JAG Lawyer looks to Hardy, all anger gone.Tell me, detective. Did you get what you wanted? Hardy shakes his head, sadly.Your weapons, Sergeant. West doesn't move. Kendall walks over and DISARMS West, pushing him into the circle next to the terrified Nunez.Washout rejects, guys he said were \"dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead\"...You haven't found any bodies yet, have you...Are you ready for this?", "clean_line": "like baseball hardy grins osborne stops watch asked policeman slow like know like army basic need yeah int styles office morning styles
