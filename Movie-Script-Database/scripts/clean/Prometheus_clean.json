Radius, inclination, azimuth...more data here...Can we raise this thing?Me too. Checked it twice.What do we do now?What's first? You do climate, I do genetics?You think he's serious?Weyland can send his shuttle out for pizza.Martin. If this meeting goes like the others, maybe we should...How do you know?Hello, DAVID.They say you're getting diminishing returns. It's not working.Doctor Watts.I was analyzing historical changes in human DNA. I found the same pattern. Every eleven centuries, a pulse of new information in the genome of the human race. All over the world. Evolution can't do that. Something was changing us. Changing the DNA of our species.Once you know what you're looking for, it's amazing how the evidence falls into place.The writing is a formula giving the location of a single star in our sky.You're bluffing.He made the Heaven and the Earth.And that change coincides with a visit by the Engineers. They didn't just change us. They changed our world.I'm out of sorts. Sorry.My head's buzzing.Like you've done this before.Yes, thanks...By an unmanned probe. Very crude.No.Confirmation of Professor Holloway's theories would change everything. There'd be science before Holloway and science after.DAVID. I wondered when we'd see you.All's well, I think.You studied our work for two and a half years.Is that a Pauling medical pod? There's only ten of those things on Earth! I guess nine, now.But when you get back...They don't know? They volunteered.We probably won't meet anyone. You'd expect a star-traveling race to generate radio or laser signals. Fusion drives and gravity drives have clear signatures. But Zeta Two Reticuli is silent. And the Engineers have gone missing on Earth.By the pattern, they should've come to Earth seventeen centuries ago. And again six centuries ago. But no sign. After twelve thousand years...they stopped coming.First humans in the system.Why look like a man at all? Why not be a box on wheels?You see yourself as a superman.What if they're really there? The Engineers. They could be there. Waiting for us. What then?Tungsten, tantalum, aluminum. That could be technology.Identical, apart from weathering.I don't think anybody's been home for a long time.We've got that outside the windows and you want to wait `til tomorrow?The air here will kill you, so keep an eye on your supply and watch your seals. Pathogen tests are clean.The door's open.Martin. Martin!Jack it open? Or cut through?Martin. This air's breathable.Intense field readings. Huge power sources here.How does this work?Look.Do you see, the size of them? Like that ghost we saw...They switched to channel three. I hear them talking. They're okay.Martin. Martin.They were killed. All of them.Communications are going to hell.Help me unload!You don't want to know.Martin. Look.They look like us.Formaldehyde!How could anyone know...Twenty-four pyramids scattered around the moon's equator. Massive power supplies. Vents in the walls. Atmosphere changes. Breeder tanks... The pyramids are terraforming machines.It didn't fail. It was wiped out.Neural paths are still conductive.Formaldehyde's killing the tissue.Of course.The lens is where the phase shift happens.Glasse. I want to look through these lenses. Can you seal them and do the optical correction?We found the gods. And they've been murdered.What could kill them?Martin, stop!What is that?Where'd you come from?What are the guns for?You should have talked to us. Martin's mission leader. That's in our contract.What are they doing in there?!We found the tomb of the gods, and brought grave-robbers right to the door.Something different killed these.Martin? Martin!Please, anyone...I need help. Martin's missing.We can't leave Martin out there.She says \"her forces are committed.\"Thank you.I can't think about this now!I'm human.No.Janek, hang on...We've got him! Martin! Where's your helmet?Let's get you home.What happened to you?What's this?What did you see?Are you okay? You sound...Martin.All right.We will. You all right?Your heart's beating so hard.Martin! Martin!Martin!Martin. Martin!I want to understand.We found Engineers who died like Martin.Explosive wounds in the chest. Whatever killed Martin is the same thing that killed the Engineers a thousand years ago.But not all the Engineers died that way. The others were torn apart. Slashed to pieces.DAVID.How did you do that?Their homeworld. Do you see where the Engineers come from?DAVID. The creature that killed Martin. There are thousands of them under the pyramid. Hatcheries.Those things wiped out the Engineers on this moon.You're turning things on? This site should be sealed. Evacuated.It's too dangerous.If your owner gives you a direct order, you have to obey. Don't you?I can have Vickers pull you out.What's protocol two?DAVID. What are you doing?Stop!DAVID. No. No.Why would they make such things?Come on...I need a Caesarean.Not yet...not yet...I was.No. I brought it in. I took it out.Protocol two.DAVID exposed me to a parasite. He just watched it take me.I threatened to make him leave.There's a ship under the pyramid. DAVID calls it the Juggernaut. He's inside it. Re-activating it. The things that infected Martin and me.The Engineers made them to kill humans. There are thousands of them on the ship. They were taking them to Earth. That's what the Juggernaut is for. To exterminate us.Even if we could, we can't leave DAVID on that ship. We have to stop him.You're DAVID's owner. He has to obey you, right?But if you went to him, turned on your suit's loudspeakers, he'd have to hear you. He'd have to obey.So we go. Armed to the teeth and fast as we can.Where are Chance and Ravel?You called your soldiers in and left them out there?I think you should stay aboard. Keep working. If we fail, you're our only shot at getting home.Glasse. You finish that project?God's-eye-view.All this time. DAVID saw.If DAVID comes at us, shoot. You won't believe how fast he is.This way.Stop.Who's missing?I know.The Juggernaut?Where will he go? DAVID. Where will he go?We have to stop the Engineer.Pilot's seat. This way.No!The Juggernaut's lifting. There's a living Engineer on board. He's taking the ship to Earth.Dead. All dead. Janek. We have to stop that ship.We have to do something. That ship is genocide if it gets to Earth...What about you?Yes.I am!Janek. Look.DAVID.I'm not going to fix you, DAVID. I don't need you. I'll hold out.

The terraforming.We sent you a prospectus that...I'm an archaeologist.In my studies I discovered a pattern I couldn't explain. Every eleven hundred years, sudden advances in agriculture, tool use, technology. Inventions. Something caused a great leap forward. Every eleven centuries. The pattern holds as far back as our data goes.Tens of thousands of years. I had to understand this. It became the focus of my work.Dr. Watts was a student of mine.Humanity's been visited. Visited by...beings from somewhere else.They guided us to civilization. Lifted us up, again and again. I call them the Engineers.This is the writing of the Engineers. We've found it on every continent. And last year, we found our Rosetta Stone.We're keeping that confidential for now. But that's where we want to go.It's a chance to be part of a revolution in scientific...That's impossible. Our research is-That's right.What's that?Get out of there!Give us a moment, will you?Never worry.You just slept two and a half years. It'll pass.I've read all about it.Proof of the Engineers' existence.Captain, your crew's been up for a week. We could've used the time.

Some of the technical aspects...I know, I had to cut my manifest. This used to be the number four cargo bay.We're about to reach the system periphery. I thought you'd want to see the search protocols we -You might make the discovery of the ages.You don't believe in what we're doing.I think all our mythologies are race- memories of the Engineers. Horus the Sun God. Prometheus bringing fire from heaven. A pillar of fire, a pillar of smoke. The Engineers are the gods.Exactly. Why?Only my first question. I have many.EMR scan, thirty hertz to three hundred gigahertz. Spectroscopic passes on every planet and major moon. Infrared and albedo scan for hot spots and light sources.Anything else?Take us in.DAVID. Enjoy the show?It was, it was. You know, I've seen more convincing humanoid robots.Then all my dreams come true.Start with passive systems. We're uninvited guests. Let's be quiet.Go active. Mapping radar.What do we see?That's not natural.Still quiet?I want to get below the clouds.Look there.Are we recording?Let's see the next one.Let's see the big one.Nobody home.All right. Let's move.Move slowly. Stay together. Don't touch anything. Things may be more fragile than they look - or more dangerous. There might be technologies operating here we don't understand.Tell me that's a natural formation. Undeniable proof of alien civilization. You were here on this day, thirty-one December, year of our Lord 2172. History will remember your names.Jocelyn. Here.The writing of the Engineers. Conclusive connection.Recording?Fifield. Get a grip.Fine.You can deploy the drones. Drop them in the first or second nexus on your way back.And half our gear? It's no more than a mile. You can walk it.This should lead to the core of the pyramid.Let's do as little damage as we can.Miracles and wonders!Space below us. A big space.Ravel. Chance. Where've you gone? DAVID! Where are you? They didn't come down!It wasn't a ghost. Where are the others? I don't want to go back up.We should stay together.I know. Look.\"There were giants in the earth in those days...and when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, they bare children to them, who became mighty men.\" Genesis six four.Peace.In all the old mythologies, the visitors from the sky were giants.Come on. The dead can't hurt you. DAVID. Chance. Ravel. I've got something here.We've found something here! I'm not walking away for bad weather.Jocelyn!Day one.My friends. What we do here marks the greatest achievement of our species. Contact with another civilization. Humanity came of age today, on this moon. You were there. To history.We look like them. Genesis 1:27. \"And God created man in his own image. In his own image created He him.\"It's breaking down.I know what it does.Think. What we've seen. What we know.That's why Earth's ancient cultures built pyramids: in imitation of the gods.Twelve thousand years ago, beings from the sky set pyramids on the Earth and transformed the world. That's what they were doing here - before their civilization failed.You won't get anything. Tissue's too degraded. Hmm. Brain chamber's massive, even proportionately.Did you record that?You've pried too many arrowheads out of old skulls to get squeamish now. They've been dead what, eighteen hundred years? Two thousand?Who knows?But I guess we know why they never came back to us. Something killed them off - back around the time of Christ. Maybe He was one of them! A great teacher, sent from Heaven? Jesus. The last Engineer.Where is everybody? We can't - Who are you?And you are...Worksite?Why wasn't I told about these additional personnel?The science must come first. You can wait until we've documented...Let them scratch. This find's too big to ruin. There's two dozen pyramids on this moon. Anyway, they're on the wrong track. That's infrastructure.The core activity of the complex was down here.Broken. I fell. Little...disoriented. I've just been...She told me. I'm sorry.I need to lie down. We'll size things up in the morning. Fair enough?Not here.Jocelyn. I saw something. God, my mouth tastes like an old boot.Neck-ring of my suit, I think. Fell on it.After my fall, I woke up walking. Delirious. My helmet wasn't right. I took it off. I was in and out. I just wandered. I went up into a huge space like a cathedral. And I found a model of the galaxy. Floating in the air.This was real. My headset video is wherever my helmet is...but my suit tracker will show where I was.Listen. This star map had a marker representing Earth. Very clear. Another marker I'm sure represents this moon. But there were others. At least seven or eight more.The Engineers aren't from here. This moon's just an outpost. Abandoned. But if we follow that map, we may yet make contact with a living civilization.The location of the Engineer worlds is the real prize. Next to that, Weyland's terraforming is chump change. We need to get coordinates. And keep them from the Company. We have to play this smart.Two men dead...Vickers is jumpy. As soon as she gets what she wants, she'll take this ship home. We have to move fast.I'm fine, now.That's your fault.Seven dead Engineers all facing the same way. Going where? Jocelyn's right, we don't see the big picture yet. Another level below me.
