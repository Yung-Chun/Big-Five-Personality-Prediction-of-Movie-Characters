Maybe a year, maybe more or less.I'm sorry.Thanks.I'm pretty tired, is it okay if I just go to bed?I'm sorry.Hi.Yeah.It's nice. I didn't know there was a lake.You don't live in the city anymore?Not really, sorry.Where are we?How far are we?Yesterday.Just wondered.Why?Is that him?Hi!Great. You've got a really nice place here.She's been great, everyone's been great.Marcy was my grandmothers name.Sure.You coming?What?Why?So?I will. I'm just going to sleep a little more first okay?It's okay.Hey Max. Where do they go at night?I shouldn't.

Thanks.What?Good.Maybe that's better. Sorry, thanks.Why is the house so big?For two people, it's huge.So no one else lives here?You're married?When?I lost it.I got used to not having it.Was it a big wedding?Did Aunt Dora come?Did she smoke like chimney and complain about everything.You never had to live with her.She lived with me after mom died.She hates me.I hate her.Is it true married people don't fuck?You're kidding.Why does it matter?Whatever makes you happy mama bear.You microwaved chicken nuggets and fish sticks.Really?I can't remember anything, I just woke up on the floor and felt this pain -I'm not.Cleaning. I thought I'd help out more.Is Lucy coming?Oh.It's okay.Yeah.Fine.No. Why?I don't know, it's normal I guess. She hasn't changed much.Where is she?Why?I can't imagine it Lucy holding a child.She wouldn't know what to do with it. Do you want a baby?So you're unhappy!Why?I lost track I guess.I didn't think Lucy would worry about me.Can I go swimming?No.I can't.Nothing!Sorry.It's been hard to sleep alone.I don't know. It's a big bed, you guys were on the other side.Sorry.Okay.Yeah.Because it's privte and it's not normal.Do you ever hear things hitting the roof at night?We had a garden where I lived?I'm good at some things.Who?What do you mean?No.Yes.He never hit me.I do.There's nothing to talk about. I had a boyfriend, he lied to me, I left. That's it, everything doesn't have to be a big DEALYou okay?You're not. You'll quit.Who's that?You think?Whose car was that?Just curious.What's wrong with the tap?It's a waste.Did you know that guy?The guy in the store.He was looking at me like he knew me. Did you say something to him?I don't know, you tell me.He was staring at me like he knew me, did you talk to him about me?Just drive the car Lucy.Drive the car!We share all of this, if it fits, you can wear it.This is where we sleep. You can take any bed that's open or you can sleep downstairs.We don't eat until the evening.You'll get used to it. Your body doesn't need that much food. You're taught to overconsume.Katie's, but we all help out.Uh huh.He only has boys.You want to hold him?Not if you don't want to. There are plenty of jobs to be done. You'll find your role. It takes time for people to find their role in a new family.Does Patrick know?How was it?Did he give you the money?Do you tell him you're not?Don't get the wrong idea Sarah. We don't talk to our old families.Hi Patrick, Did you meet Sarah yet?I don't mind.Okay.Oh, hi.Nothing you don't want to. Drink this, it will help you relax.It's herbal. It's the start of your cleansing.We've all done it so you know there's nothing to worry about.I know it seems a bit silly, but it's a part of it.You look amazing. It's your special night with him, enjoy it, you'll be great.Shouldn't we start cooking?I thought we were going to cook.Oh, yeah.Do you ever have this thing where you can't tell if something's a memory or if it's something you've dreamed?No. Like what?I didn't think about it.We were far apart.The past doesn't matter.I took care of myself.Stop it.No.I know you don't think much of me but I knew what I was doing then and I still do.I don't need your guidance, I never did. I'm a teacher and a leader, you just never let me be that but now I know I am, I know who I am.Just because we're sisters doesn't mean we need to talk about everything that comes into your head.For what?I don't know.No.Why?There are other ways to live.Sure.I don't know. People don't need careers, people should just exist.You can do that if you want to.It's not your fault but you learned that success is measured by money and possessions. It's just not the right way to live.You don't know anything about it.Who's this?She not there?Where is she?Who is this?Alright, my turn.What do you mean?They're living animals.I can't.I trust you.You okay?Where are you going to go?You don't want to do that.Max, they're not rules. It's just common sense.It's not about taking shit.And that's why you don't get to come. You just don't get it. You need to quit drinking.You're still living with all the shit you carried out there. You're the only one, let it go.No. You can't try. You have to stop. They love you, they just want you to be stronger.You'll be okay.Sorry.No. I can't sleep.I should try to sleep.It's alright.

I'm sorry I ruined the party.Is it over?That's good.I don't want it.We have to do something.Watts!How long do you think we'll be down here?Do you feel alright? If you hit your head you shouldn't sleep.Do you know why we're down here?What do you think it was?Do you still think about leaving?No. I just wanted to see about you.Hello?Who's this?Can I help you?It's Marlene Lewis.
