Stress fractures in the heel ...Right as rain, Ellie. Now, why did she jump?Perhaps. Or maybe to select the smaller, more tender leaves in the higher branches with which to suckle her young?The science of paleontology can't answer these questions. Novelists and artists who dream a vision of the Jurassic period can attempt these questions with their imaginations. What we scientists can say is considering the mass and kinetic articulation of these bones, this animal had a vertical leap of about twelve feet. Not as entertaining as fiction, but absolutely fact without prejudice.Jim, you keep making up the plaster batches. Whatever ratio you're using, it's perfect. Nora, no digging after five - when the temperature drops, those bones are just too brittle. Bill, I don't want any tourists walking over my raptor - I don't care if the Governor of Montana is with them, just you guys.Jesus, a limousine. We're re-entering Hammond's world, that's for sure.

I'm talking to you!Mr. Regis, what is the nature of this park?Hammond's trademark.I hope this isn't one of those animatronic exhibits in a Jurassic botanical setting.- the furious haste to commercialize genetic engineering.Here we go.No, I don't mind popular science. I dislike the commercialization of science. It breeds a sloppiness, a disregard for method.Mr. Hammond, the essential truth of a scientific law ha s nothing to do with public reaction. Water freezes at thirty-two degrees, whether you pay for it or not.Who makes a windows ... smaller?Don't worry - he'll grow out of it.What exactly do you mean ... biological attractions?Yes?We don't have the science. There's no source of dinosaur DNA.Like mosquitos -Mosquitos that sucked the blood of dinosaurs. That's your source of DNAIt does?But even thousands of mosquitos wouldn't give you enough tissue to determine a complete DNA strand.Okay, you have your \"complete\" DNA strand. How do you grow it?And how do you know what it is you're growing?That's why you create the mist.What kind of eggs are these? Are these shells plastic?Don't worry. Ellie makes her own judgments.I like to wait and see.Ellie! Can you imagine the excavation team seeing this!Ellie? What the hell are we going to do with the rest of our lives?Can't you see it, Ellie? We're the ones that are extinct now.It's like a Gila monster of a cobra. It's a poison ...Poor girl. What's the matter? Ellie, look at this.These'd give anybody a stomachache.Hey, Ellie take a look at his. Good work, Timmy.Looks like your trike swallows stones to help her digest her food. Walking around, she crushes berries against the stones. And even just a little crushed berry is eventually enough,But with th e stones, she swallows them and probably bypasses any mucosal contact. Straight to the stomach. I would test her excrement.Soil samples?Good idea. I'll keep my eyes open.Where is the T- Rex?Maybe she's down hunting apatosaurs.Then where is she?He's here.There'd be no stopping it. Huge, with no natural enemies, and a suppressed hunting instinct.Is that still the T-Rex paddock?What's the commotion?Nedry? With an incubator? Regis??We gotta tell Hammond and Arnold right away. How far is it to the mainland?I wouldn't like to see dinosaurs running around Costa Rica.Timmy, be quiet. Don't move.Don't move.Shut that flashlight, Tim!Lex, are you okay?Let ... go ... please.Timmy. Are you ok?Below. She's fine. Let's get you down.Try the door you're leaning against. Nice and slow.Crawl this way. Slowly.We're going to have to make a jump for it, Timmy. Okay?One, two, three, jump.You owe me one.Where'd Lex go?Come on out now, Lex.Cone on, Lex, it must be cold in there. And tight. Why don't you come out?I'm a grownup, Lex. Come on out. Gimmie you hand, come on, here you go.Me, too. We've got to get ourselves back to civilization.It's Regis and the Rex is after him. But it's okay. Regis knows the Rex can't see him.

I bet we have at least ten miles to go. If we take the raft along the river, we can make much faster progress.Lex, I don't see any raft.Bullseye!No raft. Where did you see it, Lex?Assumed?I'm afraid there's no raft.Looks pretty calm.No.There's a current.I'm not sl eeping... yet.Guess I was wrong.Hold on real tight.I'm trying. I'm trying ... Ooooo!!! ....No!!!!!I think they cut the power. Hey -Well, there's our pot of gold. Let's go, kids.Sorry, Tim. We gotta climb up.Probably your grandfather's quarters. Let's go.Actually, stay here.No, keep an eye on things round here for me. I'll be back with the others.I'll radio the ship as soon as I find somebody. You're in charge now. Don't move from here ... unless you have to, ok?Be right back.Ellie, I'm go glad -Talk, Ellie, just keep talking.Timmy, you know anything about computers?Ok good, you're elected.Okay, we've reached the computer room. Who can te ll Timmy how to reboot?Tim, you got to book the system. They reset the power and there are no phones. We gotta turn on the fences and we gotta stop that ship.If we can get help very soon.Ellie, we're working as fast as we can here.Don't mention it. It was Timmy.Queen Anne, do you read me? Queen Anne?Report your position!Try this for identification, Captain Farrell. You are in possession of stolen biological materials. If you don't turn that boat around and return to Isla Nublar immediately with your contraband cargo, you will be found in violation of Section 509 of the Uniform Maritime Act, you will be subject to revocation of license, penalties in excess of fifty thousand dollars, and five years in jail. Do you copy?Do you copy, Captain Farrell?Who the hell knows?Well it gives us ten more hours. Let's see if we can raise the Costa Rican Coast Guard on that thing.And then there were none.We have to leave now.You interrupted natural law. There are regulations, rules that nature follows that make her knowable.Barriers? Like the seasons? The earth spinning, orbiting the sun? The entire solar system in interlocking motion. Our own beings in biological step with it all. Mr. Hammond, you've disrupted the pattern and look what it's done!Don't count on it. Now get in.You created mutant forms that you further mutated to create amus ement attractions.

Welcome to an ancient and mysterious world, a world long before humankind inhabited it with all out remarkable dreams and questions. Enter a world that existed one hundred million years ago. When our changing earth was the abode of magnificent creations.Biotechnology promises the greatest revolution in human history. It will outdistance atomic power and computers in its effects on our everyday lives. We'll see square trees for easy lumbering and white trout for super visibility to fisherman. Why it will transform every aspect of human life: out medical care, our food, our health, even our very entertainment.... Jurassic Park. What we do here is made possible through the miracle of DNA replication, commonly known as cloning. To explain what cloning means, I'm going to need my own clone - John Hammond.Hi, John.Okay John, hold out your finger.I need some of your genetic material.Your genetic material is the same in every cell of your body. You have a hundred billion cells. You won't miss a couple.John, let's look into your blood, the river of life. There's your white cells, exquisitely evolved to clean up bodily wastes. And there's a mighty nucleus, the heart and brain of a cell. This nucleus has an amazing property. It can sp lit in half and reproduce itself. That's how it grows. And then those two can do it again. And again. Making copy after copy of itself.Come on, that's enough of this! And I thought to reproduce myself I had to do it the old-fashioned way.That's all we've got so far. A lot of fun, isn't it, Mr. Gennaro?It's been a long time, Alan. I know the preceding was not your sort of enter- tainment. Popular science -Well, I don't disregard method. But think of mutation - which is nothing more than sloppy communication on the cellular level. Think how triumphant mutations have been in natural selection.Donald, in bringing my old friend, Alan Grant, you've brought an excellent critic to observe the viability of my island and out venture. I look forward to winning you over, Dr. Grant.I'm aware of that. But I built this place for children. You can't investigate it without their reactions. They're what this place is all about.My grandchildren. Genetics were kind. They're more like my ex-wife than me.Although Dr. Grant suspects otherwise, this is not an ill-conceived, half-baked, poorly funded plan that I've headed. This is a plan to which I committed all of my personal resources, literally billions of dollars. And Donald Gennaro here has kindly helped me raise that sum again from wealthy Japanese. They love theme parks. I have recruited pre- eminent scientific minds from hallowed universities and we've taken the time to do things right.Jurassic Park is the most advanced amusement park in the world. We work with genetics - life's essential building blocks - to create new worlds. I set out to make biological attractions. Living attractions. Attractions so astonishing that they'd capture the imagination of the entire world.As you well know, long ago, creatures ten times larger than whales roamed our adolescent Earth. And then mass, mysterious extinction created a time barrier unscalable until ... now.Dinosaurs. I've been cloning dinosaurs!Ladies and Gentlemen, Jurassic Park. Not a resort, not a scien tific conservatory, just a little piece of pre-history that every child in the whole wide world will insist on visiting.Apatosaurs in the lowland. Gallimimus in the grassy plain. Dilophosaurus above the river. The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex! 238 fabulous creatures so far!Timmy, there's electric fences and moats and video surveillance at all times. There are monitors every hundred feet whatever we could plant them on the island. A computer to tabulate it all.I didn't create them. I found a way to wake them up, to stir them out of their prehistoric slumber.Yes ... there is.Glitches.And this is the right side of my brain. The entire park is safely controlled from here. John Arnold, that genius over there, is the m aster control operator. John, don't smoke so much, you're far too valuable a man to me.Everything's controlled from here. Remote everything. Cars, feeding programs, medicine dispensers, fecal clean up - and that can be tons in a park like this. We run this place with twenty workers. This computer does it all. And it polices each and every single animal out there.That's where I will watch the astonished watchers. Okay, let's go.Don't mind the signs. They're only legal precautions.My laboratory, Lex. It will be yours and Timmy's someday.You're both right. Amber is our gold. The alpha or our alchemic alphabet. The precious course of our genetic material. You already know amber is the fossilized resin of prehistoric tree sap, of course.Imagine - millions of years ago, tree sap flowing over insects, as it does now as I speak, in thousands of forests and backyard trees everywhere. Imagine that ancient sap trapping a little struggling insect and consuming it in a syrupy death. Millions and millions of years pass and we come along and discover this prehistoric insect. If we're lucky, he's perfectly preserved in a fossil form inside the hardened sap which is now amber. And as we examine more and more amber, we find many perished insects, including among them, biting insects -Like mosquitos, precisely, Dr. Grant.The extraction room speaks for itself.Right. You are witnessing the extraction of tissue from the thorax of this humble insect. If this mosquito has ingested any foreign red blood cells - say it bit a hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a T-Rex - we will extract those blood cells and obtain paleo-DNA, the how-to-build instruction book of an extinct creature. So you see, Ellie, I'm not creating dino- saurs. Fossils left behind the information, the map of how to bring them back. I'm helping them escape from the confined of time.Right you are, Dr. Grant! More like hundreds of thousands of mosquitos are necessary to provide even a partial strand of DNA. And without a complete strand, we don't have a dinosaur.Ah, I knew you two would hit it off! Dr. Grant, this is Dr. Wu, my chief geneticist.Don't forget to thank me when you pick up your Nobel prize.You are standing in the middle of the most powerful genetics factory created since the expulsion from Eden.It's like finding the missing pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.Our primordial soup.There's no problem Dr. Wu can't handle. Now who wants to see the real thing?Gennaro is putting negative ideas into Ellie's head. He's a naysayer. I have no affection for that type of thinking.Kids, mind Mr. Regis. He's in charge now.Gennaro, for once in your life, let something really move you.He fainted. I've waited fifteen years to impress that young man.Oh, balls.A bullet? Muldoon - no! Now what? I have five left?Oh balls. I will not terminate the raptors just because they're behaving normally. They're hunters. Why can't we contain them properly?It's just a zoo, Muldoon. A zoo. Figure out a way to contain them. And we'll sit down and have a nice long discussion about raptors - after my guests leave, okay?Wh ere are they? Punch 'em up.How can you say it so matter-of-factly? The trike's. You casually accept it, but I never can. You know what it means when you say \"by the trikes\"? \"By the trike's\" means that they're out there by the species: triceratops horridus. It astounds me every time what I've done here. What magic, what alchemy. We turned a piece of a rock into a dinosaur. I will never be complacent about that.Hello skipper, John Hammond, how are you tonight? I certainly don't want to imperil anyone. But can you give us one more container of food? Then we'll feel comfortable is the storm delays your return. Could you help us out here? Of course, if it looks too choppy just go, but you'd be doing us a big favor.Look at them. Leaning out the windows, so eager. They can't wait to see it. They have come for the danger.Damn those people. They are so negative.They comb this island like a bunch of accountants. They don't experience the wonder, the awe of it all.It's like the Garden of Eden out there. This is the most beautiful time of day.Yup. Call the kitchen. Those kids'll be hungry when they get in.Slob!What's going on, Arnold? I want those lights on. I don't want my grandchildren scared.Well, I want the computer up. This is the wrong weekend for glitches.Oh yeah? Please tell me what's worse than the lights going out?Where the hell is Nedry? Where is he? Did anybody check the damn john?Arnold's on it. You go out and bring back the tour right away. I don't need any of this!I'm sure you'll find them.I'm sure we will. After all, I keep telling everyone, this park is made for children.Missing? Of course I know they're missing. You just said that. Look, Bob, let's not get carried away. We've had a little breakdown from the storm or whatever, and as a result we've had a regrettable, unfortunate accident. And that's all that happened. We're dealing with it. Arnold will get the computers cleaned up, and the radio and phone lines open. You'll find those kids and my good friend, Dr. Grant. I'm sure they'll want some of this ice cream. It's very good.He, Donald. Glad you're awake. I hope you're not going to take this little mishap you had and hold it against my park. It would be terrible if the finishing funds were in any way held up.You really shouldn't have gotten out of the vehicle. The park is actually quite safe. A disenchanted worker sabotaged some equipment. Arnold, Muldoon, and Wu, all loyal employees, are righting damageTake a look at these, Donald. Have you seen these? These are great.Wind-up toys. Spitter umbrellas.I got some great t-shirts. Dinosaur bingo, hey ...Wu says he can make a foot highGrowth hormones.Let's not argue, Wu, we have a serious problem. These animals don't last. There is a regularity, a predictability about when they die. It's always ... very young. We don't know why. Given time, I'm sure Wu will figure it out. It's just ...But there are deadlines. The park opens next summer. And it requires full-grown specimens. So Wu uses growth hormones to achieve the desired size in a short amount of time. But they all keep dying and we don't know how to stop it.I was going to tell you all this myself, Dr. Sattler, after Gennaro stopped breathing down my neck. That's why I wanted you and Dr. Grant here on my island - you have to help me keep the dinosaurs alive. Won't you please help me?My God, look at this, Arnold.They've stampeded ...No! Oh no! He make a kill. He killed one of my animals! Where's Muldoon?My animals! My animals!Where have you been? My Rex killed a hadrosaur. You should be out there, doing something.Could he drown in that position? That's a very valuable animal.What the hell is going on?You're ruining my ordered, precise park!Fix my park, Arnold! Fix it!Told him, fix my park, fix my park.Do you mean those raptor s could be loose?Regardless, check the pit. Make sure there' five of them there.This is why my quarters were specially fortified. To assist in an emergency just like this one. Let's go. Muldoon, round up the workers. They'll go with us too.Dr. Grant, don't abandon this beautiful place. I need a man just like you to help me get my park back on its feet again. And it will be on its feet again.Oh you don't know. There are wonderful plans in the works, sites already purchased for Euro-Jurassic and Jurassic Japan.Don't you see I've exalted human potential here? You must see it. You must feel it. I called back a life form. Listen, Dr. Grant, don't go. Be a part of this. I'm inviting you to do just that - let the others go, if they want.You mean there are rules that nature follows that create barriers to our knowledge.I know what it's done. I've made triceratops and gallimimus and a T-Rex. I've got a batch of iguanadons being born on Tuesday. What do you say to that?I created genetic miracles!The merchandise is just a by-product. Souvenirs for people to reflect on the wonder. You fainted when you saw the brachiosaur. Alan, look, let's not argue. The problem is that my employees were not up to par with my dream. They failed me. The park, I promise you, is safe. It really is.It is not! It's blooming! In the throes of labor! You are one more more negative voice in a universe of negativity. You'll amount to nothing. You'll be a bone-brusher all your life.
