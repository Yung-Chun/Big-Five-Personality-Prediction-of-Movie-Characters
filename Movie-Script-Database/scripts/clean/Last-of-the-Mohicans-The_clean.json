{"Last-of-the-Mohicans-The": {"HAWKEYE": {"raw_line": "Hello John. Cleared another quarter, I see.That we did. John. But the horicane is near trapped out.So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?Folks here goin' to join in that fight?Trap over the fall and winter among the Delawares in Can-tuck-ee.Your enemy ...I said ... France is your enemy. Not ours.First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio. Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands ...... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?You do what you want with your own scalp. Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.... No ... Do not call myself much of a subject at all.... case your aim is any better'n your judgment.Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany. They'll never make a passage north.... Fort William Henry.... take you as far as the fort.If we are goin' to take you, we need to move. Fast ... And the fort is well off our course. So if you all rather wait for the next Huron war party to come by, we'll be on our way.Day and a half Where did you get ... the guide?He is Huron and nothing else. Why would he want to murder the girl?Dark haired ...No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?Came across the war party, tracked 'em.No.No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.I ain't your \"scout\". And I am in no damn militia.England does not protect me and does not war against France on our account. She uses us to war against France on her own account ... of greed for land and furs.Clear it up any?Do not let gratitude get in the way ...Ottawa!Movin' fast, not able to carry much ... this was a war party?Let us go, miss.Miss Munro. They are not strangers .... And they stay as they lay ...!Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing ...Well that is to be expected. My father ...Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.Yes. He said ... \"do not try to make them understand you.\"Yes. And \"do not try to understand them. That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense ...\"In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance ...They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.I do not remember them. I was one or two.My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds ... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yous.The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people. So after seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin' by another's leave ... Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.My father's people say ... at the birth of the sun and of his brother, the moon, their mother died ... so the sun gave to the earth her body, from which was to spring all life. And he drew forth from her breast the stars. The stars he threw into the night sky to remind him of her soul. So there is the Camerons' monument ... my folks', too, I guess.Sorry to disappoint you ...Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.Dropped in to see how you boys is doin'.Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.John Cameron's cabin. We come upon it last night. Burned out. Everyone murdered. And it was Ottawa. They're allied to the French.It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.Many men here, their homes are in the path.She know what she's doin'?She does not shy away from much ...Nothin'.Miss. May I?You 'bout done holdin' hands with Miss Munro?Why, I am looking at you, Miss.He does not want to hear it. But he is gonna have to.Another forty yards?... it was no raidin' party out for pillage. The cabin was attacked by a war party. They are sweeping south down the frontier spreading terror among farms and Mohawk villages 'cos all the men are here.That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families ... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.You're a liar!And the blood is on your hands!Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!That is the truth!Major! Some day I think you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement.... got no kin in the settlements. If I did, I'd be long gone.By my light that's how I saw it then and I see it that way now ...Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers ...I'll cover them from the top of the casement.Got a reason to stay.It does and it is a better lookin' reason than you, Jack Winthrop. Push hard, 'cos you got to clear the French outpost by dawn. Good luck, Jack.I helped Winthrop and the others leave ... This fight is not yours, father. I love you and my brother. And you should leave this place now and go to Can-tuck-ee ...Sorry ... can't ask you in.Because what I am interested in is right here ...Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not. If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father. The French will protect the officer class among the English.Do not. Promise me.This part of it sure is ...I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.Cora!You got nothin' better to do today on Lake George than shoot me, Major, then go ahead ...Pull!Only chance we got is ... ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!Pull!!Pull ...!Head for ... for the white water.Here's where it gets tricky ...Don't move ...We don't.This is it, as far as we can go ... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.Maybe ...In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them. Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?If they don't kill you, they may take you north up into Canada. A warrior may take you for a wife.Listen. Submit. You hear me? You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you ... no matter how far, how long it takes ...Translate for me, Major. Into French. Every word ... as I say it.I come to you unarmed and in peace to unstop your ears, wise one. Because the Hurons are mislead by the words of the wolf who's never spoken the truth.Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron.So the Huron are the servants of the French? To do what the French are shamed to do?Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese ...Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man? Would the Huron have greed for more land than a man can use? Like Francais Black Robes do? Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But sell the fur to the white man for gold? ... Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron men who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs? ... Magua's heart is twisted. He would make himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs? ... Magua's way is false. It is like the white sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness and shame. Is there another way? I don't know. I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican people ... Let the children of the dead Munro go free ... I speak the truth.No! listen. Tell him I'll trade him! Me for her! Tell him!!I am La Longue Carabine! My death is a great honor to the Huron. Take me!I said to trade me!And my compliments to you ...Will you go back to England?Then will you stay in America?And will you be my wife?Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.That's my father's sadness talking.What is that?", "clean_line": "hello john cleared quarter john horicane near trapped jack brings folks goin join fight trap fall winter delawares tuck ee enemy said france enemy place started french fur trapping claims head waters ohio sayin people fight hands cooped fort french send war parties raid homes want scalp tellin subject case aim better judgment wounded try walkin albany ll passage north fort william henry far fort goin need fast fort course wait huron war party come ll way day half guide huron want murder girl dark haired blood vengeance proach insult came war party tracked em headin west tuck ee ain scout damn militia england protect war france account uses war france account greed land furs clear let gratitude way ottawa movin fast able carry war party let miss miss munro strangers stay lay lookin pick trail sign passing expected father chingachgook warned people like yes said try understand yes try understand breed apart sense particular case miss allowance buried ma pa sisters chingachgook french trappers raised remember father sent uncas reverend wheelock school know worlds told bother learning readin arithmetic yous bible monarchy wrong ideas government men father people know man nation dominion kings man better man cos frontier land land affordable poor people seven years indentured service virginia headed beholden livin leave cameron john alexandria father people birth sun brother moon mother died sun gave earth body spring life drew forth breast stars stars threw night sky remind soul camerons monument folks guess sorry disappoint ridge fort lake george downhill dropped boys doin help horns powder stores man run straight webb john cameron cabin come night burned murdered ottawa allied french war party means attack frontier men homes path know doin shy away nothin miss bout holdin hands miss munro looking miss want hear gonna yards raidin party pillage cabin attacked war party sweeping south frontier spreading terror farms mohawk villages cos men judgment important right agreement webb defend farms families major heyward john cameron saw liar blood hands easy suppose women children farms english law trusted maybe people better makin peace french truth major day think gonna disagreement got kin settlements long gone light saw way northern sally port strike east swamp clear french picket line head north ridge come southeast fork left little meadow free outpost skirmishers ll cover casement got reason stay better lookin reason jack winthrop push hard cos got clear french outpost dawn good luck jack helped winthrop leave fight father love brother leave place tuck ee sorry ask interested right webb reinforcements arrive arrive fort fall happens stay close father french protect officer class english promise sure know happens stay father stay officers cora got nothin better today lake george shoot major ahead pull chance got distance em ground pull pull head white water gets tricky far lucky ll figurin come way ve beached canoes headed cross land lucky ll figure went falls south rim mountain miles cross country fort edward forego pleasure hangin maybe chance live try free powder heart chance understand kill north canada warrior wife listen submit hear strong stay alive matter far long takes translate major french word come unarmed peace unstop ears wise hurons mislead words wolf spoken truth let children dead colonel munro free english anger murder helpless ones wise french fathers peace swore honor break friendship magua broke false french friends huron huron servants french french shamed magua use ways les francais yengeese huron algonquin brothers foolish brandy steal lands sell gold white man huron greed land man use like francais black robes huron kill tribes disease huron fool seneca taking animals forest beads brandy sell fur white man gold ways yengeese les francais masters ways huron men hunt work land dogs magua heart twisted twisted dog master dogs hurons dogs magua way false like white sickness magua way bring sadness shame way know nathaniel yengeese hawkeye adopted son chingachgook mohican people let children dead munro free speak truth listen tell ll trade tell la longue carabine death great honor huron said trade compliments england stay america wife winter delaware father cousins spring cross ohio look land settle father new place called tuck ee father sadness talking"}, "HEYWARD": {"raw_line": "You, there. Help my man outside with the baggage.Major Duncan Heyward reporting, Sir!I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.The Crown \"negotiating\" the terms of service?I thought British policy is 'Make the World ... England', sir.Sir! ... Might I enquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.By your leave, sir.Dawn. At the encampment. Six a.m. sharp. See to it you're there.My God it's good to see you.And by sea!Aversion? No. ... \"Hatred\" ... \"Loathing\" ...But it was worth it all to end in a garden by your side.Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time ...?\"Some\"?Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?Will you consider that?My God, you've grown up.Yes, miss.It can be dangerous ...Are you alright?Absolutely.You there, Scout!We must ... stop ... soon. Women are ... tired. You ... understand?No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?Excuse me. What did you say?... why the bloody hell he do that to the horses?!We were headed ...How far is it, scout?Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.What?!Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.Of course not! And how is it you were nearby?Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?Fort Edward, then?I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!Anything to be done?Who were these people?Excuse me ...Let us look after them ...The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice ...Posting to a different continent.I'm Major Duncan Heyward!Where's Colonel Munro? His daughters are here, too.One called Magua arrived.Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!Ambush ... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it. ... eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here ...Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?They look to be three hundred yards out. You have three days.Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.Yes, sir.Things were done. Nobody was spared ...Sergeant! Form three ranks!Fire!!!Advance, Sergeant Major!Fire!!!Sergeant Major!Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.Cora ... I wanted to talk to you, but I'll come back another time ...I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ...Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England ... I am certain of that. More than ever before. I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts ...I see ...I saw nothing that would lead me to the conclusion it was other than a raid by savages bent on thievery.That is sedition! Treason!I ought to have you whipped from this fort!He knew the penalty for breaking regulations. He ought to pay without sending you to beg.And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a \"by your leave.\"You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.This is the signature of Webb. And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts!

If you ever fall ... into British hands ... What white water?Where do we go from here?I don't understand!Then what?And if we're unlucky?Any powder?What the bloody hell plan is this?Coward!
