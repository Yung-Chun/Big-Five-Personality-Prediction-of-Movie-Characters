Hello?Yes?Who is this?Cory Gillis. 442-8730.Hot flash, Cory - prank phone calls are a criminal offense prosecuted under penal code 653M...Enjoy the movie.Nah... I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.I can't believe I let you talk me into going Greek.Pumps. Nice handbag. Whaddya think?What murders?What's going on?What's going on, Dewey?Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?Oh my God. How could it happen?It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie.Yeah, right.No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.I skipped. Too many \"That's her\" looks.Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.No PDA.This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?You're not allowed to ask that.Thanks, Joel.It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.No special treatment. I can do this. C'mon Hallie.Hello, Gale.I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...Yeah, well... you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.My morn was a Delta.Randy? What are you doing here?Cotton...What are you doing?You BITCH!Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.Any news?The forbidden subject.It's starting all over again.I'll get my jacket.Hello?Who are you?What do you want?Then come and get me.Derek. He's in the house. Help... me...Please, I have the perfect excuse.Gotta.Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.This is exactly what I don't want.But...My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?\"Pain, yah, such pain. Pain.\"Shit. Did I?Yeah, right.It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.What do you want?Do you work for her now?Me, too. Randy. Me too.Wanna get outta here?Yeah.Cotton.I don't think that's a good idea.What do you want from me, Cotton?I did that.How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life - how do I apologize for that?Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist.Did it?What?I don't know. I don't think Cotton did it. It's too predictable.I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.I have this button I press. See? It insulates me.Thanks for the movie, Randy.No, it's not.It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.I'm sorry, Derek.Excuse me? Did your computer just freeze?I'm not signed on.He's here. He's in the room right now.No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.Someone else has been killed.I'm fine. I wish people would stop treating me like glass. I'm not gonna break.I'd really just like to be alone.Dewey, there's no such place.No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.But who would operate your camera?He's cool, Remy.It's not a good idea, Hallie.Whatever.Where are you taking me?I feel like Eddie Murphy.SOMEBODYPLEASEOPENUPSOMEBODY!Oh God, help me. We have to call the police.Do you have keys? I need to get inside.Shit!Mickey? Mickey?Oh God, no, Mickey...Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.He's after me.I'll be right back.Watch out.Don't panic.Watch out.Hey.Hallie?Hello?Hallie?No. This is a set up.Why?You're not going to get away with this.Gale!Okay, look, you guys - I applaud your methodical expertise but I have a question. What's going to happen after I die? I thought the heroine is supposed to live.But nobody wants to see that. It'll never go. They'll rewrite you. You don't want that.You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos...Mrs. Loomis?Oh my God.Why Mrs. Loomis?You'll never get away with this.NOOO!Please, Cotton, don't do this.It's over, Cotton.", "clean_line": "got hello hello yes cory gillis hot flash cory prank phone calls criminal offense prosecuted penal code enjoy movie nah think ll die opening weekend let goes believe let talk going greek pumps nice handbag whaddya think murders going going dewey people watched oh god happen copycat killer knew happen fucking movie yeah right crawl rock fucked world people kill people time ll stairs dewey completely equipped mace alarm whistle keyring knife degree defensive combat dewey ll okay work let quasi pseudo happy existence skipped looks ask coddling life rolls status quo pda joel estimated serial killers currently active given time control hungry allowed ask thanks joel okay peddle toilet paper special treatment mon hallie hello gale okay people magazine won stop calling yeah definition mixed emotions hate movie getting good reviews hell week pledging deltas morn delta randy cotton bitch missed shining moment won macaroni sundae binge news forbidden subject starting ll jacket hello want come derek house help perfect excuse gotta guys guys sorry way exactly want screwed life shouldn bleed friends film isn week started pain yah pain pain shit yeah right okay look hallie ll meet outside ve got entourage break want work randy wanna outta yeah cotton think good idea want cotton difference took away year life apologize cotton isn day hour minute reminded ve second reprieve therapy religion spiritual plane erase feel vein wish need hear think words exist know think cotton predictable guess gale going pissed missed exclusive button press insulates thanks movie randy derek trust tend big selection errors comes men sorry derek excuse freeze signed room right hallie tonight parties mass murderers trust killed fine wish people stop treating like glass gonna break like dewey place hallie gonna ll alright operate camera cool remy good idea hallie taking feel like eddie murphy somebodypleaseopenupsomebody oh god help police keys need inside shit mickey mickey oh god mickey listen ve got help killer ll right watch panic watch hey hallie hello hallie set going away gale okay look guys applaud methodical expertise question going happen die thought heroine supposed live wants ll ll rewrite want fucking freaked movie nut psychos mrs loomis oh god mrs loomis ll away nooo cotton cotton"}, "GALE": {"raw_line": "Quick, get outta here.Just go. l'll find you later.I don't know... no one's talking. What's the studio's position? Never happen. They'd be stupid to pull the movie. With all this free press - they're gonna have huge numbers this weekend. It'll break box office records. Of course I have bumps.I need two minutes at six o'clock. I wanna do a piece on the slain kids - no sympathy shit - let's stick with the movie angle. I wanna pull a clip from an old film...Hey, what was the name of that movie?HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE. Yeah, find it. Don't worry, I've got it covered... I have a plan. Yeah, I'll get it. Give it a rest - I said I'll get it. Later.Pressure's on. You ready for this?Look, I'm sorry about the face.Fair enough.Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.Do I know you? You look familiar.Good for you.Guys, you're missing the show.Hello, Dwight.I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...The name's Gale, remember'?I see you read the book.And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.You have every right to be upset.I never meant to imply...I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.Sidney. Hello. How are you?I'm sorry.It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?It's good to see you involved.Did you get it?You need to check your conscience at the door. We're not here to be loved.Of course, what can I do?Maureen Evans - Maureen Prescott. Sidney Prescott's mother. The first victim in the Woodsboro Murders. Phil Stevens - Stephen Orth - the first kid to be murdered. Ten to one - Cici is not the third victim's real name.Nickname Cassie or - Casey. The third victim in Woodsboro. She was hung from a tree and gutted.This is a complete copycat. Your killer is even going in sequence.In the book or in the movie?Mr. Himbry - the principal was the next victim. However, in the movie version, Tatum Riley was killed next. Dramatic license.What about Sidney? Is she safe?Tons and tons.Home - where he lives.Why don't you ask them?No, I don't.Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.Hello?Who is this?Who are you?I don't play games.What do you want?Where are you?Oh - a God complexWhat do you want from me?What do you mean?You're getting obvious.No, wait...I'd prefer Dewey, Captain.The interview's not going to happen. 1 changed my mind. I've harassed the girl enough. It's in poor taste and a bad idea.Gotta go, call me when you have something nice to say.Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.Yeah?And where did you gain all of your Gale Weather's insight?I'm not here.C'mon. Keep him talking.He has to be nearby. He likes the game.Randy? Randy? Where did he go?Where's Sidney'?Not good. How you doin?What's going on, Cotton?Did you do it?You have a right to be angry.Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.Where is she?You're just isolating people. You're giving the killer a blank canvas.Sid, I'll come with you.Hey, Dewey?If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?Billy had alibis too.You broke the lock.What are we looking for?Can we turn the light on?Dewey, you and I would never make it.... and as lonely as I am...Tell you what. We get through this one. And we'll take out a hotel room. Over here with the light.And Joel's pre-med.Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on - they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.Ssshh! What was that?This is all too familiar.Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.Jesus Christ!Shit!Let's go.No, Dewey, let's call for backup.Dewey?NOOOOOOO!Someone's trying to kill me. I need the police.Yes, goddammit!I don't know.The safety what? Fuck that!SIDNEY!Fuckin' hurry.Shit.Sidney!What?Jesus. It can't be.You're Billy's mother?You're all in this together?Jesus, you're just as whacked as your son.What are you going to do?But you'll never get away with it.Thank God.God, Cotton, what a nightmare.

Could you cheat a little forward for me?You're really stumped, aren't you? You know there's two killers but you don't know who they are. I'm a given. The boyfriend. Way obvious. But now you're torn.

It's a whole world, Sid. You're really popular amongst the demented.Until now.Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?The way I see it. We'll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.We're hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.Hope you're ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel.

We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It's been an ongoing discussion. Heads or tails?Shit! You win.Yeah, we're trying to send a message to Hollywood.
