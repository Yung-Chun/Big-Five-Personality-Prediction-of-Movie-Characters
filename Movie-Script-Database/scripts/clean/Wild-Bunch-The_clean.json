Kneeling on the ground he opens it and counts out two small bags of gold, and hands them to Zamorra. Zamorra hands them to Pike.About two.. miles up the arroyo ... three cases of rifles, one of ammunition, are in the brush behind it.Our contract was 16 cases of rifles and 8 of ammunition -- for $10,000 -- not a machine gun. It is our gift to the General.I'll think it over.Just carryin' all this weight. He hold's up two bags of gold.You and your brother take in the next' load, and the machine gun - 'then Dutch and Angel.
