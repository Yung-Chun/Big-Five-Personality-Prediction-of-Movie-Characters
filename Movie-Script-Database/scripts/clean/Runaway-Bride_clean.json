Listen I'm thinking of writing about those mind-numbing informercials that are always on.Okay, I was also thinking I might write about...Fisher? Come on -- I know you're sitting there laughing at me. Pick up. I want to run an idea past you.When your t-shirts stop shrinking.I don't know yet. I'm kind of a last- minute man. Ideas don't flow until an hour or two before deadline.No, I can't hit on you until I get an idea.No, you don't understand.I don't write bitter diatribes about women... very often.That's last minute man. And it's the quality that counts.Excuse me?Not as private as I thought.Give me a pen.... They're up, they're down. It's really fun making this list with you, but I've got a column to go write.I give up.\"Today is a day of profound introspection, I have been accused of using this column to direct bitter diatribes at the opposite sex! This uncomfortable accusation has plunged me into at least fifteen minutes of serious reflection, from which I have emerged with the conclusion that, yes -- I traffic in female stereotypes.\"I'll put in a good word for you.Why?Fully. I like her. She has wit.So? I never returned your calls, even when we were married. And what's Fisher doing here anyway?Since when does Ellie need moral supp--What?Lesson number two. Never work for your former spouse.I didn't cook up a story. I had a source.Don't knock drunk guys in bars. Drunk guys in bars are good. It means they're not driving.I merely write the stuff. You're the one that serves it up.Lawyers. I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you. It's going to be hard to get over. There will be therapy bills for you.See? You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?What are you trying to say to me, Fish?The real story on Miss Carpenter.The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.This is good. It is a good story, Fish.Okay, you were right. I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.\"Paid vindication\" That's what I call justice.But I'll get my normal fee, right?You want me to do it on spec?!Oh yeah! I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.I think I'm in Maryberry.Hello. I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter. There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...What?About her upcoming wedding and all.I am just such a reporter. And you are?And who are these lovely ladies?Looking for Maggie.Originality is my speciality.Sorry, no. I just got one.Yes, Mrs. Pressman.I know. Tell me something. Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?Good fact. Well, you let me know.You'll answer my questions?Getting nervous?Weird dreams? You're going to tell me about them?I think you'd look good in red.Yes, I think I nailed the personality profile of the women of Hale.No thanks.Thank you.I'm not here to make you feel bad. I'm here for vindication. In my heart...I feel I'm right about you. You got me fired, lady. You destroyed my reputation and you screwed up my hair. You chew men up, spit them out and loved it. And I'm down here to satisfy myself on that point.Yes. Conviction. Conviction that I'm onto the truth. You're going to do the same thing to \"poor bastard number four\" that you did to the last three. You're going to run again. And I'm not leaving until you do.We'll see.Hey, kid, I'll give you ten bucks for your hat.They made me put my hat back on.Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there. You don't think they'll call it off...?You know, your daughter seems...That's okay, Grandma.Ah, beautiful. I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.She has a tape?Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...That's fair.Ahh.Everest. Is that right?Really?How romantic.Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak.You won't believe what I'm looking at, Fisher. A videotape of all three train wrecks.Kamikaze!Did you see that?But he's got the Bobster's eyes.Let's see... Excuse me, isn't that cute? Ahh...Yes, I am. And who are you?Oh, Betty. I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --A pre-wedding luau?Fun? Fun isn't the word.Actually, I would love to come. Thank you. Thank you so much.No.Bye, Betty. Thanks.And talk about you.Well -- I've got to get moving -- lot of work to do today! I'll see you two love-birds later.You bet ya, Coach.Imagine! Maggie Carpenter topless in a public arena. And I see there was a chill in the air.But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.Sure, I would love to give this to you. Just give us one quick gander at that rose, and, I'll gladly hand it over.Completely.Gill, I'll go ya double or nothing if was a stick-on.Look, look, man. I think the man is heartbroken.Jerry. He'd play. He'd play... Jerry would play his heart out.Hello, Peggy Phleming, \"not the ice-skater\".... And this is Maggie's beer.Not yet. I had a phlemless morning. I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.That must have made you proud.It's nice that they're still friends.You can turn that finger around.Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it. The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.All right, I know you're in there... You steal my research... You're messing with the first amendment now. Open up. Open up. You got no place to go.I want to have a very serious discussion with you as to why you're such a pain in the ass.I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.Coffee. Now.I'm not a boastful man. What's your point?Really.My magazine doesn't pay because for stories. It's not what you call ethical.You've seen the post-its. I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?Too much.Five hundred.Done.Cindy the manicurist.This is wonderful. You reconfigure all these industrial parts and you do something amazing with it.I like it. This whole thing is pretty incredible. I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.You afraid to try?Well, I'm impressed. Absolutely incredible. I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.Always a mood killer.It's a little \"Silence of the Lambs\" for me. I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.Wait. Don't tell me. The scoreboard lit up with \"Mary me, Maggie.\"Highly suspect.Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.I'm a work in progress.No. I think I said something eloquent like, \"So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know. What do you think?\"I don't know.No.Call me crazy, but I believe that check I gave you entitles me to ask the questions for a while.Ow!Agreed.Mrs. Whittenmeyer. May I talk to you for a second?Perfect. Because Miss Carpenter is here to buy one. But not just any one. She wants that one.Tough to spend money in this town.You look... uh... You look fine.Bob will be very happy.Of course.Tell me. When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?Well, I'm off. A reporter's work is never done. Mrs. Pressman, thank you.Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.Bye, Netta... Bye, Grandam.Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis. This is \"King of Blue\"! This is the original recording. Hard to find in good condition. Where did you find this?It's valuable. Hang onto it.Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?No. Forget about it. Don't even think about it.Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him. Keep an eye on him.I was talking to the dog. All right?My dad managed a business and two mistresses. He wanted me to be a novelist. More?Can you fix it?Of what?Kind of isolated.There's one thing we New Yorkers know how to do is hail a cab. If there's no cab, we walk.Snakes? Are you serious? I don't like snakes. I've never even seen a snake.No. But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading. And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.Yeah, we need a half and nine- sixteenths.You're sure well known around here.This is about her negative attention, not mine. Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?I don't know.Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.Yeah.Okay, we'll order out.Get this man a Kamikaze.You could have told me you were fiance number three.Thanks.Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.Guess you'd know about that. You're an entomologist, right? How's business?Neuter a locust, feed the world.I don't think that's why she ran.I don't know. I'm working on it. I was on the wrong track.No. I call it like I see it. I'm a journalist. I'm a truth teller.Oh, please!I'm writing an article, I'm getting paid to do this, it's going to be a cover story, it's going to be published ... The facts will be read someday.No... They're interesting guys. Each one of these guys has something going for him. I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest. One's a pretty good guitar player. And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all. Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her. And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.Is that what I did to you? Is that what happened? Did I just not see you?Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.You got something without a toy in it?Aloha. That's a very fetching headdress you're wearing.Missed me bad, huh?I don't know, give me a minute. Are you all right with this?Are you all right with this? You think this is funny?I don't and I don't think you should...You want me to make a toast? Okay... I'll give you a toast. To Maggie's family and friends. May you find yourselves the bull's eye of an easy target. May you be publicly flogged for all of your bad choices and may your noses to rubbed in all of your mistakes...I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing. It's the theme of this party.Well, they should. Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.Or the sexual habits of locusts?What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.Supportive? You weren't being supportive. You were being scared. Just like now. You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.That's right. You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.With the priest, you liked them scrambled. With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached. Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.No, that's called not having a mind of your own. What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon? You don't want to climb Annapuma.No you don't. You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem. You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say. Am I right?I'd rather not.At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.I'm sorry, Bob. She kissed me back.A little longer for me.How about -- \"I hope you'll be very happy together\"?I don't know. I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.I love you. I love you.Wait. We have to talk. We have to do some talking now. Pull up a railing.Me?Well, you do have the dress.And the wedding date. There's the two of us. So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.So am I.I'm getting married.Shoot ours so she has one with an ending.No, I'm not.Friends. Thank you. Thank you.Then you'll be my best man.Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do. And someone will tell me what to do.Thank you.Really?Got any last minute advice?Eye contact. Eye contact.Your job is... the ring. Do you have the ring?!Thank you.Mrs. Trout, go back to your seat!Block the doors!Maggie!Maggie!Maggie!Maggie!Don't tell me. My doorman is one of your many admires... I knew I should have given him a better Christmas gift.I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I? But I can't speak for Italics. Traitor!Livid is good. So what is it, Maggie? You here on business? I saw your lamps. They're terrific.You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career. So, what are you doing here?Does it matter?Yes, I did.No, I couldn't fix anything... But I still ended up chasing a truck.Should I be writing this down?Used?This is getting serious.Oh my God. No.Maggie, I gotta think about this a little bit.You were not.I'm listening.Pretty good speech, Maggie.Dance with me.", "clean_line": "hey fisher pick column ideas want bounce okay listen thinking

I can't ready anymore.No, you tell her.No.Yeah.So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?Uh, Maggie, you told us to bachelorette jokes, so we didn't...You're a goddess!Stop it. When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.Are you a reporter?It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.Peggy Phleming. Not the ice skater.And you are?Yep. Maggie -- Someone to see you.Yup!Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.Great.Let's just put this back here for the aromatherapy.Hey, Pete, I'll be right with you.No, she's talking about your hair.For what reason? Some personal satisfaction?It's probably because you got him fired.Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look! Cory's going for second!...

That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...Good morning to you, too. You look good.Yes.I know. I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.Like certain kinds of coral.Why?No, I don't think you're like, \"I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you\". Very hard to compete with. Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.No. I'm weird. Weird and mysterious are two different things.No. You're quirky. Quirky and weird are two different things.I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up. But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids. And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.Something that brings warmth to my heart.

She may need this. It's not really Hawaii.Oh, she just went to get me something from the car.Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.He's going to be the pastor?What happened at the luau?It's for the bell.Don't be nervous, Maggie. Let us visualize. Remember what Bob said? \"Be the ball.\"\"Make the shot.\"\"Never say die.\"Well, Maggie -- in the words of Mrs. Pressman: \"Holy moly\".

I could use five minutes off from that creep.You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?You misinterpret everything. We've all been friends our whole lives. But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.See, I cheer good. What is he, a cheer critic?This guy never stops.Lee, hey, wake up. Give me the key to the reporter's room. I want to snoop around.Thanks.\"How does she get all these guys to propose? She's not that beautiful.\" Bite me, paper boy.You do that. And remind him he's bringing the wine to the luau. Thanks.Do you think I flirt with Cory?Thank you. Do you think I flirt with Cory?I don't mean it.On anything male that moves? As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?I'm going to kill myself.Because you think I'm all like... \"Hey man, check me out\".But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!But I'm weird.Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up. Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.I think you're right. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.Thanks. Will you fix my hair?Freeze. Hold on to those covers -- I didn't come here to see Ike Junior.How do I do it? I'm not that beautiful.You're welcome. Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction. Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong. That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either. So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.I've decided to cooperate and let you interview me. For a thousand bucks.Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical? Actually, I meant you. You probably got severance or expenses or both. I'll take your check. No credit cards.Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.Seven-fifty.Six-fifty.Pardon the mess. I haven't cleaned since the fifth grade.It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.No, the other one.I think so.Maybe someday.No, I'm not afraid. Just... Maybe someday.What an incredible chauvinistic observation.That's Brian's. He took me ut canoeing on the lake and gave me the ring in a velvet box.Still sweet.He's an entomologist! I thought it was very unique.It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life. Cal Ripken even applauded.What do you mean? It was incredibly romantic!I like it.So? Is that what you said to her?Now that's romantic. A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?You don't know.Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?Fair enough. Actually...Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.Mr. Whittenmeyer. Hi, Polly!I didn't drag. He tripped on his shoelaces.Actually, I would like to get this dress.Yes. But I've changed my mind.I have one thousand dollars.Is this dress for sale?Yeah, that's a good point. The other dress is nice.Fine. The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.Bob! I almost forgot! I have to meet Bob!I'll have the same.What was that? I can't order my eggs without sarcasm?Right.You know, there's no...Ike... Hi, Grandma.Actually, Grandma, I charmed the one- eyed snake awhile ago.Can you excuse us a minute? May I have a word with you, please?I found this and didn't know if it was something interesting.It was in the attic. It was jus sitting there gathering dust.No. You take it.No -- I'm cleaning an attic. I wouldn't attempt the impossible.C'mon. Let's go.I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.Watch your leg, Dad. I'm so tired of this.Okay... I'll just grab my jacket.Your filter's clogged. This takes unleaded.First I have to find some tools. I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.Wrenches. My dad's gonna love that one.Yeah. It's kind of nice.I can get some tools over there.... and save the battery... There's one thing we country girls know how to do is cut across a field. It's quicker.Do you think there's only one right person for everybody?Yes it is. And it doesn't mean anything.Lighten up, what?I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.I'm going to go dance with Bob. Because he's the man. I like those grapes.Where did you disappear to?Excuse me?Yes.You humiliated me!I had it under control. Now they feel sorry for me.It's fun! It's high.That was very interesting research George was doing!I already explained about that.Brian told you that?Every one of those times I was being supportive. Something you won't understand.Lost!What!?That's called changing your mind.Yes I do!Stop. Stop it! I'm getting married on Sunday, and you're just trying to make me run! Why? Because you're a cynical, exploitative, mean-hearted creep who wouldn't know real love if it bit him in the armpit! And all you do is tear other people down and-and-and laugh at them, and criticize what they do, because you're too afraid to do anything yourself! I read your column. You never wrote one about you. I'm not the only one who's lost and you know it! Am I right? Well? Am I right?Yes.Jerry Kramer.No. No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect. Hey.Yep. I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.... I don't even want to talk about the luau. What's this?Go!Yes, I'm spiraling through the air.I kissed him back.About a minute...?Really?Take care of him.Bob, I'm sorry! At least I backed out before the wedding. That's progress!Okay. So... what, uh... What just happened? Just now? Jus then? In there?Me, either.I love you, too.To who? Are you asking me?Yes, you!And the church.I'm okay with that.So, we'll...Grandma!He's not coming. Watch. He's not coming.You and your lucky geese. You always see geese.Eight is good... \"V\" could be Victory.It's hurting.He's here!... He's here!This is not a good sign.Thank you, Grandma.Thank you, Dad.No sauntering down the aisle. Just make time. Let's just get there.Just a second.There's a man coming down those steps with lots of candy in his pockets. If you tickle him, he'll give candy.I'm just finishing up, too.No, I'm just going to head home.What are you talking about?Thank you. You still think that he was....Hi, Dennis.You're sweet, Dennis. But you've got to go. I'm closing up. Here's a candy bar and one for your brother.Hey. Grandma, what's for lunch?STOP!Just stop it. Don't say another word like that.No. It's my life.No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid. I don't like it. Stop. You may not like having a daughter with problems. But guess what? I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time. I'll eat in my room.I need a plan... A plan to life... What would Bruce Lee do? He'd kick some ass...Hello, Ike.I've been making friends with your cat. Is it okay that I'm here?I don't blame you for being mad...It's something I've always wanted to do.I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.I think so... When I was walking down the aisle? I was walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was. And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted. So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.I didn't. And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.I understand why you bring up the truck. Let me explain something. The fact is, you've seen me at my worst, most embarrassing, deviously plotting, potentially but not certifiably, psychotic state. And if you liked me then, I mean, now... I can't imagine... Benedict.These are for you.They're mine. I'm turning in my running shoes to you.And one more thing. I know it's hard to believe there could be more. Um...No, no -- don't hide your face, this only happens once in a lifetime. It's definitely a first to me, and you're not going to want to miss it.Good.I was, because if you said \"yes\" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part. And I've been practicing it. Ready?\"I guarantee that we'll have tough times. I guarantee that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me\".I borrowed it from this guy I know.
