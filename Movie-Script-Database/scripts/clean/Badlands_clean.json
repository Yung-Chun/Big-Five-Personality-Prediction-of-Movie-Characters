I'll see you In the morning.What do you mean?Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you. I'll try anything once. What's your name? I said mine.Listen, Holly. you want to take a walk with me?Well. I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kind of lucky that way. Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they?Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like \u0093druthers,\u0094 doesn't it?Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.Nah, I got me a job.Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.Hey. wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?Sure.I used to throw trash for the City.Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.Well. what the hell. Just hope there's a breeze.Hi.Quit my job.Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything.

Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.Yeah.It okay me leaning on your Willys here?Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir. That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.She'd get along okay. And if she didn't, well, she could take off, just take off, I wouldn't mind... I'd always tell people I deserved it.Takes all kinds, sir.Hi.I've got a gun here, sir.

That's what it was like, a POP.Course nobody's coming out of this thing happy, especially not us. You can't deny we've had fun, though. Which is more than I can say for some.... Mmmm. that's the end of the message. I run out of things to say... Thank you.How you doing?Yeah, me too.Take a break. Red...

Holly wants to visit some of her people down there, but after that I don't know... They say Mexico's nice.Okay.Okay.Put that down. It's dirty.Cato!Look at all this junk.I got him in the stomach.He didn't say anything to me about it.Bunch of junk.He stole that cage. I saw him doing it.Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.Well, he's gone.He said not to tell.Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.Can't afford to take chances.Let's us step out in this field here.Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.You don't mind?Okay, you two, down in the cellar.You promise to stay down there for an hour?You expect me to believe that?I'm going to shut the door.Think I got 'em?Well, I'm not going down there and look.You tired?Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.Well, we'll see about that... Hey, lookie.They're probably going to blame that on me, too, bastards.Hi, I come to check the meter. My tools are in here.Oh, this Is Holly. She's from Texas.Excuse me.Hi.This your place?Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?Next time I ring that, it means time to clear out.Listen to your parents and teachers. They got a line on most things, so don't treat them like enemies. There's always a chance you could learn something. Try to keep an open mind. Try to understand the viewpoint of others.

Never had any reason to.Well, I'll catch you a big trout. Soon as we get to the mountains.Everybody loves trout.Maybe we should've tried to hop it.I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.Well, maybe we oughta be stuck here. I'm not saying that I know.Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place.Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction.
