{"Distinguished-Gentleman-The": {"TOMMY": {"raw_line": "Be positive, Armando. Course it will. The claw inadvertently snags a rabbit's foot.Look. See what a lucky fuck I am?So do I. The claw catches the ring and closes on it. QUICK CUTS of their FACES as the crane rises. A very pretty lady. A beefy Latino with a two-day beard. Their apprehension. Tommy's confidence. Then his exceptional smile. He gets the ring. INT. PENNY ARCADE - DAYOkay -- one down, one to go. You got quarters, Loretta? END TITLES.That's a vodka tonic, a Pellegrino, lime and no ice, a gin Gibson straight up with ex-tra onions -- I am also fond of de onions -- and a Chardonnary spritzer...also with extra onions -- no, no, do not worry, that is just a little joke. There will be no onions whatsoever in your spritzer! He LAUGHS HUGELY, rather amused with himself. The guests aren't.Mr. Memory? Do not make me laugh! He LAUGHS HUGELY, turns, takes two steps away and makes absolutely no effort to get their drinks. He looks toward the door. INT. HALLWAY/ENTRANCE TO FUNCTION ROOM - DAY Loretta approaches the function room, where pert DEBBIE, wearing a JOHNSON FOR CONGRESS button, staffs a felt- covered table. On a nearby easel, a photo of a silver- haired Man with a legend in blue and gold: JEFF JOHNSON. THE NAME YOU KNOW.Absolutely my friend! How can I pleasure you?Ah! Fire and ice! Wonderful! But may I suggest you make that a double sir? After all, so many guests, so few of me -- who knows when I may be back?That wasn't me! You must be thinking of Jamal. I'm Karim. What you want?Hunh. He walks two steps...and once again makes no attempt to get the drinks. Zeke returns to Jeff Johnson.I told the CIA everything! I agreed to poison the pineapples! My green card is in the mail!Nothing.Valuable? We can almost see the light bulb click on above Bruno's head.A hundred and five? Bruno snorts agreement, goes for his wallet... Tommy goes gor the ring... then suddenly leaps back in a cringe!No! It's a trick! You will call me a thief and send me back and the Security Police will make me stand on my head in the guano pit! I have seen such things onNo, no... it is a trap! I must turn this over to police. He starts to leave. Bruno grabs him.How big is this... reward? Another lightbulb.You said 'thousands.'No, no, no...you said thousands. With an 'S'. This is plural. This means \"two or more thousands.\"Or more. Two or more. Bruno's had enough -- his grip tightens around Tommy's neck.Just making a point. IN HOTEL LOBBY AT THE CASHIER'S DESK Bruno slides a check to the Cashier, who counts a stack of bills. Bruno picks up a house phone, dials. INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY ARMANDO, still unshaven, answers the RINGING phone.I remember... you were the sloe gin fizz and the mango daquiri? With perhaps a small umbrella for the lady?And would you still be wanting the umbrella then?I'm in the wrong business.Busted? Moi? Fuck no. He pulls out the wad of bills. Their faces brighten considerably.That look like busted? EXT. CAPITOL - NIGHT Washington, D.C. The illuminated dome of the Capitol. INT. CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE - NIGHT CAMERA ROAMS the well-hung walls. From the photos and memorabilia, we realize that we are in the office of Rep. Jeff Johnson.

An artist.But I only con crooks, Grandma. You can't con an honest man. Only somebody who wants something for nothing. But the good Lord must have been fond of pigeons, because he made so many of them.You mean, dead?See? I told you TV advertising works. He opens the phone and speaks in a toneless, recording- like voice.Hello...you have reached Girls of Many Nations. For Hot Blooded Italian Wildcats, press \"one\" now. For Perky American Cheerleaders, press \"two\" now. For a Sultry Swedish Love Goddess, press \"three\" now... He covers the mouthpiece and calls to Loretta.Bingo! Loretta...guy wants to speak to Inga.Ja, this is Inga. Hello Paul... how are you tonight? You are feeling naughty? That's all right ...you have your what in a bowl of oatmeal? Yes, that is very naughty, and maybe a little sick.Oh NO! It's my husband Lars. He's home early, I must go before ...you want to talk to Lars too? So you like to talk dirty out of both sides of your mouth. Man, you are one twisted bastard! Laughing, he hangs up.Sorry, grandma, just getting a third minute out of him. He clicks off the phone and slams it back into Loretta's purse. Loretta, meanwhile, has reappeared.What's up, Grandma? Are you embarrassed to show my picture around the pool?What did you say, Grandma? EXT. BAIT SHACK - DAY HOMER, the proprietor of Homer's Pit Stop, wearing fuel- smeared overalls, is dieseling a Customer's boat down by the water.Homer! Get your ass over here!Loretta!

I'm gonna come to your house and tear your ass up!My friends, I want to tell you about a town where the streets are paved with gold. This is a town where the marks give you money before you ask.

This is a town where a guy bounced nine hundred checks and he didn't even have to skip town!!!No. Washington, D.C. I'm going to run for Congress. His big smile meets their blank surprise. Their faces fall.Van Dyke. You remember Willie Sutton?You remember what he said? They asked him, Why do you rob banks? And he said, That's where the money is. I tell you, people -- Washington. That's where the money is.I found this shit in the library. You know how much a congressman makes? A hundred and thirty a year -- and that's just base pay for getting your ass elected. Then there are these things called PACs, and these lobbyists, whose whole point in life is to buy you off. It's the con of a lifetime -- and the damn thing is, it's legal! This is hot, people, we can do this!You never heard of staff, Armando? I get in, I get a staff allowance of five hundred and thirty-seven grand a year -- Loretta wolf-WHISTLES.-- which I will generously share with you.Not for me, Homer. For Jeff Johnson. Name recognition -- that's what it's all about. You think folks know their congressman died? I get on the ballot as Jeff Johnson, I guarantee they'll vote for me. Now all's I have to do is get on the ballot.Which is where you folks come in. All's we have to do is collect five thousand six hundred twenty five signatures.You people got a better idea?Okay... gimme the four-one-one on these Silver Foxes Again. It's a bunch of old folks who like to vote?Ah.So all I have to do is snow one old lady. Don't sound like major surgery.Mrs. Rifkin... I want to run.What I mean is... I'd like to run for Congress on the Silver Fox ticket. I care about you and your issues.Because I can win.Mrs. RIfkin, if you give me a ballot line, and if I can get support from...Sure, but... besser die viller ein der kenner. Hattie cracks up. Tommy leans over and translates for Van Dyke:She said, 'If my grandmother had balls, she'd be my grandfather.'The same place I learned to hustle shtarkers at gin rummy. From Morris Elfbein... the Gin King of Miami Beach.He taught me a great deal. He taught me you don't always need the best cards to win.Oh, I have a name.No ma'am. My name is Johnson. Jeff Johnson. The Name You Know.You leave that to me, Mrs. R. INT. JOHNSON HOME - DAYHe was a great man, Mrs. Johnson. He did so much for my people.Oh, yes. I'll never forget when he said 'Welfare is a drug -- and you gotta kick it cold turkey.' It was... inspirational.And I was actually in the audience when he said, 'If you people would just get off your dead asses and look for work, this country might be fit to live in again.' Powerful stuff.Wilson-Pickett State Teachers College. But I didn't just come to pay respects, ma'am. I came because your husband deserves an archive. A place where scholars can study his legacy. A storehouse for the record of his remarkable career.Oh, not just his papers, Mrs. Johnson. Everything. Buttons, posters, bumper stickers. All the paraphernalia of his campaigns -- proof of his political genius. Now I realize that you may have a sentimental attachment to a few items...I beg your pardon.Well, I don't think that's necess...Well, um... no.Actually, ma'am, I should be getting back.Look, I, um, have a class to teach. You know how blind students are... they're so dependent. Don't worry ma'am... your materials will be in good hands.We're not going to show you Jeff Johnson waving a flag. We're not going to show you Jeff Johnson kissing babies. We're not going to show you Jeff Johnson doing anything, because you already know what Jeff Johnson can do.Tomorrow, vote for Jeff Johnson. The name you know. A very puzzled Vera Johnson watches the ad on tv. SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT The congressional district sleeps. But in the darkness, a kind of D-Day onslaught is under way. QUICK SUPER- IMPOSED CUTS of Tommy's secret army of Silver Foxes, opening crates, fanning through parking lots, swarming over lawns, driving in stakes, tacking up posters everywhere. INCLUDE Tommy climbing a telephone pole... Armando shinnying up a light pole across the street... Loretta and Van Dyke pulling on a rope... which hoists a huge bundle to Tommy... who opens and unfolds it... and gets an end through the air to Armando. They unfurl the biggest banner imaginable.Jeff Johnson. The name you know. In a different appropriate accent. EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY In front of a polling place, Van Dyke pulls up in a hearse with an ELECT JOHNSON banner.

POLLING PLACE - DAY An ordinary Couple, 40s, sign the registration book, then enter adjacent voting carrels. After a moment, the HUSBAND leans out.Thank you, thank you, all of you, for your help. Give yourself a round of applause. They do. As APPLAUSE continues , CAMERA PANS from Reporter to Reporter to Reporter, their mikes bearing the call-letters of different channels. ON GRANDMA being interviewed. She wears a JOHNSON FOR CONGRESS button and speaks with manifest pride.We ran a positive campaign. We campaigned on the issues. The issue is leadership. Leadership for the future. Ask not what you can do for your country. The people have spoken. The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. If you can't stand the heat stay out of the kitchen. Live Free or Die. And in conclusion...read my lips! INT. AIRPLANE - DAY Tommy looking out the window at the city below. EXT.

You look just like I pictured you. Nice wing tips.I like your initiative, Reinhardt, but to tell you the truth, I've never been much of a student. Maybe you can brief my staff sometime. Reinhardt looks Tommy's cronies over. Not your classic Hill types.But thank you, I will take you up on those logistics. Hey! Entourage! What hotel we at?Reinhardt, it appears that the staff has neglected to nail down some details.Four rooms.You're a wizard, Reinhardt. I knew you could handle it. EXT. AIRPORT TAXI RANK - DAYSo when does the House open for business? Reinhardt hasn't heard it put quite that way before. Reinhardt gets his courage up.I'm sure I did.That's quite an offer, Reinhardt, very decent of you, but I'm just a social drinker.Really. Tommy looks at his own troops, then back to Reinhardt.You mean like an affirmative action thing? Tommy opens the cab door.Tell you what -- I'll think about it, okay? Tommy gets in and closes the door.Thanks for getting us settled, really appreciate it. Madison Hotel. EXT.

Perched on the desk: Reinhardt.You again!What is this shithole?This.I missed what lottery?What else did I miss, Reinhardt?You're shaking me down, aren't you? Tommy laughs, then clasps Reinhardt's shoulders.This is fantastic, Reinhardt. I haven't been here five minutes, and you're shaking me down. God, I'm gonna love this town. You're hired, man. Just tell me what to do next. I don't want to miss out on any of the good shit.Let's meet some natives. Tommy leads her over to two Men, 30s, excellent haircuts. Both wear pins. He extends a hand.Tommy Johnson, how'd you do, nice party, heck of a railroad station, isn't it?No, I couldn't, it was my Princeton reunion....That's right.And it's Tommy. My friends call me Tommy. \"Jeff\" is my... professional name. So what line of work were you boys in before you got elected? You lawyers or something?Fine, but I'm gonna be real offended if either of you miss my reception. They leave.I think we have to have a reception. AT THE BUFFET, as Tommy and Loretta help themselves generously to oysters and champagne, they overhear TWO MEMBERS passing by.We're in the majors, doll. 62A THE BALCONY is full of people working one another. As 62A Tommy and Loretta pass some large stone statues, a man extends his hand -- liquor lobbyist KEN KORNGOLD.Tommy Johnson. Distilled Spirits, is that right?Pleasure's all mine, Ken, hope you can make it to my reception. Do you happen to have a card?You now what I love about this place? The way everyone calls you a Member. Every time I hear that, it makes me think of Mr. Happy here.Don't you be peeing on my shoe. They go to the sinks. The Member introduces himself.You got a CD? Shit, I missed that, too.Ohhh. Tommy Johnson. Florida. So Iowa -- how'd you get to Washington? You do the crop report on tv? IOWA has a big open face and a flat Midwestern voice.War hero?Wait a minute. What's wrong in Washington?That's alright, Iowa -- this place could use a few geeks like you.Hey... thank you... nice to see you... hope you can make it to my reception. Have y'all met Miss Loretta? TOMMY'S TABLEMATE is lawyer-lobbyist TOMMY O'CONNOR, 40s. As Waiters serve lobster bisque, he hands TJ a business card.Who's Olaf Andersen?And how much of that do you get?Tommy, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship. INT. UNION STATION - ADIRONDACKS - NIGHT - ON DODGEWell, I would have, but I just got to town. It's an honor to meet you, sir. A real privilege. This is Miss Loretta.Excuse me, Mr. Chairman, but this ain't no homo shit we up to, is it?Well... of course... it's a chance to do something for my country. I mean, there's the topsoil thing, and acid rain is killing the cattle --No one sent me.Kid's got his talents.No bullshit?Opportunity knocks. This town is the fuckin' Yukon. A stunned silence from Dodge -- then deep and generous laughter.Food... drinks.You're on cheese. I'll handle booze. He reaches for the phone... EXT. DISTILLER'S BUILDING - DAY Pan from Capitol Hill to gleaming glass office building.Ken! Ken Korngold! Tommy Johnson here... Right -- last night. How's it going, big guy?Actually, that's why I'm calling, Ken. You said if I needed some help --Tell you what I have in mind. I was just thinking, wouldn't it be a plus for old Ken Korngold if I was to -- how should I put this -- showcase some of his distillers' products at my reception? You know, like they put Reese's pieces in E.T.? It's called \"product placement.\" People come in, they have a tremendous time, they see your products, they think well of you -- and they think well of me, too. It's good for both of us, Ken. What do you say?I do.Honorarium. I like that. Loretta appears with a platter of food.What is this? Where's the cheese?Oh, that's just wonderful. Sixty heavy hitters drop in, and I'm feeding 'em cat food. He breaks off, as Celia comes into view in the doorway behind. Tommy picks her up on his radar.We'll talk about this later. We follow Tommy through the crowd until he reaches Celia.Hi there. Glad you could make it. So you're... Celia Kirby. That's an extremely beautiful name. For an extremely beautiful woman.Whoa, slow down.What if I said... me?Don't worry about it. Why don't we just start over again?Ah. Pro Bon. That's an extremely beautiful name. For an extremely beautiful organization. Um... what is it?Why don't you brief me over dinner tonight?Yeah, sure, we'll type it up on the schedule, it'll be an appointment, except with wine and flowers on the table.Won't you at least stay for a drink and some herring?Well then, can I tempt you with a smelt?I love the way you say that. She slips out through the sea of revelers. EXT. CAPITOL - DAY A fine Washington morning. EXT. CAPITOL STEPS - DAY Rep. ELIJAH MARSHALL, 50s, black, and a pain in Dodge's ass, is shaking hands and saying goodbye to some Constituents. Dodge approaches.Tommy Johnson.I plan to be as good a congressman as all the others.Well, ever since I got back from Nam, I've wanted to do something about the rain forest --Is this good news?So... this is very good news.So what do you want from me, Dick?Yeah? Well, I'm not. I'm suspicious. One thing I've learned is, when somebody gives you something for nothing, the nothing ain't nothing. It's something. What is it? Why me? Reinhardt puts his hand on Tommy's shoulders.Keep talking.Pleased to meet you, Barclay. WARBURTON'S voice is aristocratic, a la George Plimpton.Skeeter.\"Tommy. Please. Been called that since reform school.\" Dodge chuckles, shakes his head in mock rebuke. Tommy takes his seat at the lower dais, smiles at the Members on his left and right.Let me start with a confession. I don't know much about poultry. But I do know something about people. And let me tell you: I like you people. So when you have something to say about poultry, I listen. Thank you very much. He sits down to generous APPLAUSE. ON Armando, in attendance, CLAPPING, marveling at the response TJ gets. INT. CATACOMBS - MOVING - DAY Capitol Hill is actually two worlds: the aboveground buildings that visitors and television cameras see, and the catacombs, the busy tunnels and corridors connecting the congressional office buildings and the Capitol. They're surprisingly unglamorous -- exposed pipes, white- washed brick walls, dumpsters, pizza carry-outs -- and through them move the legislators and their staffs. And here is Tommy, whistling ZIPPEDY DOO DAH. He loves this place. Passing a snack bar, he greets the Cashier.My man. He blows a kiss to a pretty Teller in the credit union. Passing the barber shop, he calls out to the Shoeshine Guy. He passes a black TELEPHONE MAN at an open panel of wires.Sweet Sue. Third race at Santa Anita. INT. TOMMY'S RECEPTION AREA - DAY Several lobbyists are now awaiting Tommy balancing plates of herring on their knees. Some are enjoying it more than others. Tommy breezes in.Hey, how you folks doin', good to see you, Van Dyke making you comfortable? Tommy hits a button on a tape deck, turning on some EASY LISTENING.Be with y'all shortly. BEHIND THE DIVIDER, outside Tommy's office door, Tommy has a word with Reinhardt. Tommy indicates his office.She in there? Reinhardt nods. Tommy gives himself a couple of squirts of Binaca.Stick around for this, Reinhardt. I've finally figured something out about the women in this town. INT. TOMMY'S OFFICE - DAY Tommy and Reinhardt meeting with Celia and an elfin guy in corduroy.That's all right. They can wait.Wait a minute, you just got here. I clean my calendar, and you're out the door. Let's back up, give this stuff the attention it deserves. Car insurance... Ira, what do you pay?Six-fifty? Highway robbery! A chop shop wouldn't give you more than a hundred forty for a junker like that. Or so I've heard. But I'm flying blind here, I need depth. Could Miss Kirby put together a briefing? Maybe schedule a Saturday or two to really dig into the issues?I'm sure you do.Whoa, whoa, hold on, what about child safety?Great! About time! I hate imported toys. What about food additives? How about we block out a few evenings, you can take me through the details.Saturday night?Let's get serious, fellas. INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT Tommy, Marshall, and the Bulldog, back in suits, exit the MEMBERS ONLY door and move through the catacombs.Yeah, he's taking a real shine to me.Nothing wrong with letting the chairman of the ethics committee roll you once in a while.So Eli, how come you haven't asked for my help with your amendments?I'm nobody's boy, mister.I'm no different from anyone else.You know, Eli, I like you, I really do. You remind me of my father.He thought I was scum, too. BELLS begin RINGING and LIGHTS FLASHING on all the clocks and sconces down the corridor. Three RINGS, pause, three RINGS, pause... Marshall does a U-turn. Tommy doesn't follow suit.Vote? Is that what that is? We got a pool going in the office on when it'll go off next.Yes, it was.I voted \"Nay.\" It's a terrible bill. It'd destroy the fabric of American life.Hey, Rafe! Tell these kids what that vote was about.Which means?You're in excellent hands, kids. INT. RESTAURANT - DAY A NOISY restaurant popular with lobbyists. Power photos on the wall. Table hopping. People SHOUTING greetings across the room. Waiters in long aprons. Tommy is having lunch with Tommy O'Connor.Thank you, Tommy. I love you too.Sugar price supports. Where do you think I should be, Tommy?You pick.You tell me.I'll stick with the salad.If I vote for the labels...then I get money from the dairy industry...And if I vote against the labels, I get money from the frozen food guys.A pepperoni lobby. I love this town.Fuck the cheese people. Thanks to them my office smelled like smelt for a week.So Tommy, tell me -- with all this money on every side, how does anything get done?No, I was just wondering how much of this is a statutory problem, and how much is a regulatory one? I mean, didn't the Merton Act cover most of this?Well, for Merton to apply you have to show high contagion...sounds to me like your contagion rates are no higher than the common clod. In b.g., Reinhardt DIVES FORWARD to his keyboard and begins correcting his typo. Celia looks puzzled.Common cold. Must have picked up a little dyslexia over the weekend.You're also impressively pretty.You're right. Sorry. Excuse me a second. Arthur? Without explanation, he THROWS HIS PENCIL hard out of frame.Must have had a heart attack.Did you miss me? INT. PRO BONO OFFICES - DAY Celia at her desk in the somewhat ratty Pro Bono offices.Oh, a fact-finding mission, some issue conferences, a few speaking engagements, a charity event... the usual.Hey. Have lunch with me tomorrow.What is it -- the ozone layer? No fault? Killer apples?You remembered! That means you missed me. EXT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - NIGHT Tommy and Celia walk over the bridge to the cherry trees by the Tidal Basin.So, how'd you end up hustling for Pro Bono instead of pesticides? I mean, you could have been a big- time lawyer, right?At a hundred grand a year, how depressed can you get? Doesn't it depress you to lose all the time?So why do you do it? She skips a stone on the water.Say it.Grandma like Jefferson. Y'know, \"Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" It's a lot to live up to, so I specialized in the last part.Fine...'til I met you. Now...the better I do, the worse I feel. They have stopped walking. They are standing close together. They kiss.So...when can I see you again? How about dinner Saturday night? She shakes her head.Brunch?This is one hell of a date. EXT. CHURCH - DAYUncle Eli?Your niece?How could I have missed the family resemblance? EXT. CANNON BUILDING - DAY - ESTABLISHING INT. CANNON TOP FLOOR - DAY WHISTLING happily, Tommy rounds the corner and heads to his office.Ladies! Looking good! How can I help you folks today! But Hattie Rifkin and her troops will have none of it.The Medical Association made a persuasive case. Ten grand from their PAC, plus Christmas in Aspen.Yeah, well, then it's thanks for the memories, and on to the next gig.Which is?Wait a minute. You're talkin' 'bout my re-election?Fifty? Sixty?I can think of worse places to get life.So how do I get the Silver Foxes off my ass?What's that mean?Look what I won! Must be that new racket. Armando has come out to hear this.Wait. What happened to you?The others?What?I never heard of that. Mickey pulls a stack of journals and xeroxes from her book bag and gives it to her mother, who in turn gives the materials to Tommy.Oh, they'll be read...This is Mickey's school?But isn't the school district responsible?Nice.Do you believe it?But why isn't it being investigated?Money talks.There must be something I can do for those people.Shit, I hope not -- it'd be a fucking nuisance in Congress.No shit. Oh, yeah, I met one of those geeks. So what can I do?Speaking of hopeless causes... They kiss, and slide OUT OF FRAME.Whatever you're having.Cheers. Dodge downs his drink. Tommy follows suit.Why, thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, to tell you the truth, I didn't know you'd be on my side on those power lines.But you said you were sympathetic --But you said --The boys here have told me a lot about you.Good to meet you.Chivas on the rocks?Yeah, what a coincidence. I thought this little party might be for me. You may not like this. I think we should hold those hearings.How'd you know I met the parents group?But there are studies that say --But what if you're wrong? As Tommy persists, Andersen looks increasingly angry.People didn't use to say smoking causes cancer, either. What if the evidence is just building, and some day we wake up and discover that your power lines are killing us?All I'm saying is, maybe we should hold hearings to look at --Maybe I should think about it.Mmmm...Who?Oh -- I, uh, haven't asked him yet.It wasn't the right moment. Besides, I was thinking, maybe I ought to line up some other Members first -- you know, get my ducks in a row.Oh, I don't know...How did you know that?That's not a question, is it?No, no -- I've still got my right nut, I can work with that. INT. CRAB HOUSE - NIGHT A WAITER removes an empty pitcher of beer.Sure, why not. Marshall takes a boiled crab from the platter between them, places it on the butcher paper in front of him, christens it --You know, Eli, sometimes people do things they regret. Everyone makes mistakes. Fact is, Dick's been under a lot of pressure lately --What do you mean?I'm not a yes-man. When Dick says no, I say no. Marshall SMASHES down again with the mallet. Crab carnage.Oh, yeah? What do they have on you?Shit, that ain't no secret. EXT. CRAB HOUSE - NIGHTEli, this is Loretta Hicks, from my staff. Loretta, Congressman Marshall.You know Reinhardt, my AA? Marshall nods. Reinhardt turns to Tommy.I'm packing it in.Thanks, I'll walk. I could use the air. INT. MARSHALL'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT Marshall and Loretta are singing. MARSHALL and LORETTA \"Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me -- \" EXT. CAPITOL HILL STREET - NIGHT Tommy is on foot.

TRAFFIC CIRCLE - NIGHTI need an ambulance right away.Evening, Mrs. Dodge, Tommy Johnson here, sorry to call at this hour, is Dick back from the Gridiron dinner yet? Could I speak with him for just a moment? INT. DODGE BEDROOM - NIGHT MRS. DODGE is in bed. She hands the phone to Dodge, who's in white tie and tails, looking more sinister than splendid.How did you know?I went out with Marshall. We got into an accident. He's out cold. I'm okay.No. Someone else. Loretta. Dodge recovers his equilibrium.Yeah. She's out, too. I don't like the way it looks. For anybody. Look. You said you wanted to get back into Marshall's good graces. Well, here's an opportunity.Oh sweet Jesus.I have to talk to you.I was set up!No, someone screwed him --Celia, something stinks here --If you'd give me a chance to --Celia --Under. She tries her hand at a false shuffle.Not bad, kid. You've got potential.I am. He takes the deck from her, fans it face up, pulls all the kings and aces, stacks them on top, and squares the deck.This is one's called the double duke. How many players?Who's the mark?Your deal. She deals out six hands in a circle on the ground.Look at the sucker's hand.Look at your hand. She turns over her own hand. It has the four aces. Mickey looks at the power lines, at the hands, at TJ. Then, understanding:Something very important.\"I keep my ear close to the ground.\" His ear my ass. He had an inside man.We got bigger fish to fry, darlin'.The big con.Dick always said I should think big.You people gone soft on me? Bunch of fuckin' incumbents I got here. Now listen up. Thursday morning Dodge has a breakfast with the Arts Caucus in the Longworth Room. Armando -- find out how fast I can get from Longworth to my office. Loretta -- we need some scoop from the EPA for the roper, I'll give you a list. Van Dyke -- call Hattie at the Silver Foxes, and --Right on the nose. He throws open the bay window of the narrow house. Just below is a pickup truck with \"Homer's Pit Stop\" lettered on the side. Homer gets out.My man! The others come to the window to see Homer, still wearing his fuel-smeared overalls, and SHOUT greetings.Now let's get to work.Eli Marshall caught his tail in a crack, didn't he?You kept my name out of it.I owe you one.Do me one favor, Dick. Next time you pull some heavy shit involving my ass, tip me off, okay?Thanks. Listen, Reinhardt, something's come up, and I don't quite know how to handle it. There's a guy from the EPA -- I don't know him -- says he wants to see me. Tonight. Out of the office. Alone, he says. Sound of it makes me nervous. I'd feel better if you were there.Mr. Yancey?He's my AA. He goes where I go. If you can trust me, you can trust him. Homer eyes Reinhardt a moment, then continues.What have you got?Nothin' comes for nothin' in this town, do it? You got any cash on you? I'm kind of light.This stuff's pretty good?Okay. Sunday. Fifth race at Del Mar. Blueboy is running twenty to one. I'd take a major position.No, not at all -- my Cousin Henry spends his days pumping water into horses' stomachs and stuffing Percodan up their butts. Trust me. Reinhardt is interested in this. And he admires Tommy's m.o.Why did the White House change its mind?Is there new evidence?And what good is this to me?I ain't got no Cousin Henry. EXT. PAY PHONE - BY REFLECTING POOL - NIGHT Reinhardt dials.Got a minute, Dick? Tommy takes him aside. The room empties except for them.Listen, Dick, I heard something. There's got to be some bid'ness in it. Tommy very discreetly gestures with his thumb and palm: money.Maybe we can go in on it together.The EPA is going to make a stink about power lines. The White House is pushing them to do a big study.Nothing gets by, do it? Tommy touches his nose, in tribute to the master.I -- I hope it wasn't my press conference that started this.So do you think there's something in it for us?And how do we do that?And you're going to -- ? Tommy makes a squeezing gesture, grins.That's allowed?Dick, wait a minute -- shouldn't we check out the tip? Make sure the EPA's really going through with this investigation?Who?There's a vote on the floor. -- and ducks into the stairwell. INT. CATACOMBS - PHONE CABLE ROOM - DAY In a chamber crammed with cables, the Telephone Man listens to a handset. He now sports a gold Rolex on his wrist -- his horse must have come in. Van Dyke, also there, looks at any array of dials and meters, whose hands all suddenly move. Some electronic phone CHIRPS, then the filtered RINGING of a call.The Administrator. Loretta picks up the phone.Warbuton here. Thank you. Mr. Chairman! I do hope there's something I can help you with today. INT. DODGE'S OFFICE - DAYOff the record?I was looking forward to some serious sailing this week -- Tish and I have a lovely spot right by Kennebunkport. Instead, here I am at three in the morning, writing testimony to your committee about cancer clusters.Not at all. You must come sailing with us. Cheers. Bye-bye. Tommy passes the phone back to Loretta.Next.Olaf? Olaf, Zeke Bridges. Listen, you sum' bitch, I'm so mad, I can't sit down to shit. Have you heard what I heard? INTERCUT with Andersen.The EPA's fixing to make a big stink about power lines and cancer. They're going to serve us up for breakfast.Proof don't mean shit. We're talking politics. They make a federal case out of power lines, I'm screwed. Whole insurance business is screwed. You know how much cash I'd have to pay out in settlements? Even if I stiffed everybody on claims, the legal fees'd be enough to kill me.You better believe it. You're screwed, too. Every hot dog trial lawyer in America soon be lining up to sue both our asses. We got to move on this, Olaf. If I wasn't tied up here, I'd go to Washington myself. Shouldn't you be getting on a plane? Just between us -- you find a way to stop this, I'll find a million bucks if I have to. INT. CORPORATE JET - DAY A very worried Andersen.How do we play it?Between us. It's not that much -- what can you get for half a million these days?Good government.Hi.Look. Whatever you think of me, just promise me one thing. She glares at him angrily. But then she's surprised to hear:Come to the Clean Air hearing tomorrow.Power and Enterprise. Noon.Shouldn't we be heading off, Dick?Have you tried the oysters, Dick?No, he's the wrong man --But -- but you don't want to bother him with this. Talk to one of his underlings -- Dodge looks at Tommy with curiosity, not understanding his reluctance.Here? Not here!But it's the wrong time!Shut up, Reinhardt, I'm talking to the Chairman. Beat it, okay?You heard about this stomach thing going around?\"There isn't going to be an investigation, old chap.\"Morning, Reinhardt! Got a minute? I need your advice on something.I want to do a little something nice for Dodge. That EPA thing -- he's been good to me, Reinhardt. Is there some way I can, like, throw a bouquet to him at the hearing today without having to sit through that boring testimony shit?He's do that?Good thinking. They return to the corridor. Tommy looks at his watch.Say, Reinhardt, my Grandma's plane comes in at ten. You wouldn't mind picking her up and driving Miss Daisy around, would you?No, I don't trust them the way I trust you. TOMMY pats him on the back and sends him on his way. INT. TOMMY'S OFFICE - DAY Tommy, joined by his cronies and the Jubas.This is it, people. Game time. Let's get it right.I don't. You run a con, you run a risk.Dick, I thought it might be a nice way to open if I congratulated you on the fine work you been doin' on this committee. Really express our appreciation. Especially on behalf of the minority community.Wouldn't hurt to have tape like that in the bank, would it, Mr. Speaker? HOMER slips in next to Reinhardt, who is surprised to see him.Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the other members of this committee, and on behalf of myself, I have a very personal statement to make. From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you -- thank you for your leadership, for your insight, for your boldness... Dodge preens for the cameras, until:... and for your courage. Especially your courage.Your courage in exposing the corruption that eats away at this institution. Your courage in taking on the special interests. Your courage in taking a major new step --You're right -- integrity isn't new to you, Mr. Chairman, it's second nature to you. Still it's a rare public servant who'll take on the special interest money, take on the PACs -- ANDERSEN, wary, senses danger.take on the lobbyists and fat cats -- CELIA is fascinated.... and who'll stand up instead for ordinary American citizens... ON ELLEN AND MICKEY JUBA... the plain people who just want peace of mind -- who just want to know they're raising their kids in safe neighborhoods and sending them to safe schools. ON THE DAIS Dodge wants to wrap this up.Yes, courage, Mr. Chairman, is a quality that you have in abundance --Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, the Chairman and I had a meeting in his office with Olaf Andersen of Gulf Coast Power, and his lobbyist, Mr. Tommy O'Connor -- these gentlemen here. Chairman Dodge and I listened in astonishment as Olaf Andersen offered us seven figures -- that's one million dollars, ladies and gentlemen.Isn't that right, Mr. Andersen? Tommy flicks his eyebrows at Andersen, provocatively, imitating Dodge.Oh, yes, you can. As Mr. O'Connor said to you, quote: \"If that's what you want, we can always find a loophole. No one will know.\" Remember saying that, Tommy?You can't deny it, Mr. Andersen! We have the whole thing on this tape! The room erupts. THE PRESS loves it. Still cameras CLICK and WHIR. DODGE despairs. REINHARDT puts his hand over his face.Yesterday, at Chairman Dodge's courageous suggestion, I taped the whole conversation. It's all there. Mr. Chairman, I thank you. The people thank you. America thanks you.Mr. Chairman! You mean to say you did all that stuff? You took all that money? Shock in the room. Some BOOS. IOWA does a nice HOG CALL. TJ sends a little wave and smile to Celia.I owed you one. Dodge wheels on Tommy, exploding.You know what? He's right! But let me tell you something -- all that's nothing, compared to what I pulled here in Washington... and this shit's all legit!Adjourned? Fine. Leave. Turn your backs on the whole country. That what you want to do, gentlemen? The Members remain in place, paralyzed.I'm a con man. A small-time con man. Do you know what it was like for me to come to Congress? It was for like dying and going to heaven. If I did back home the kind of scams I've run in Congress, my ass would be in Sing Sing. But no, I'm not a crook -- up here, I'm a distinguished gentleman!Now don't get me wrong. They're not all bums. But boy, do the rotten fish stink up the barrel. Marshall APPLAUDS. The Man in the next bed joins in. INT. POWER AND ENTERPRISE COMMITTEE - DAYNow tell me, people -- while these guys are buying and selling each other, who's standing up for you?I'll tell you who. Nobody! Nobody gets five hundred bucks an hour to lobby for the average Joe! There's no Shnook PAC! There's no National Association for Ordinary Assholes! Sure, everyone's against cancer, but \"everyone\" doesn't have an office on K Street! Don't you folks get it? We're supposed to be the people's lobbyists. Congress is supposed to be America's political action committee.She's right. Throw the bums out -- starting with me! I'm gonna found me a new party. The Don't Vote For Me Party. Any of y'all want to join up? APPLAUSE and CALLS of enthusiasm.Well, come on, then! C'mon, get up, we got work to do! The room erupts, electrified, chanting.Why? I bought it this morning. It's blank.

"LORETTA": {"raw_line": "I'm not too late, am I, dear? Hello, darling, Alma Preston, how are you today?No, honey, I don't think you do, we just got in last night from our place in Barbados -- how much is it?Yes, we're just down the beach from Mick Jagger and Jerry. You wouldn't turn down a couple of thousand, would you? A pleased smile from Debbie. Loretta opens the check- book, flashing the immense RING in front of Debbie.Oh, thank you. I thought it might be a little gaudy...who should I make this out to?That's my Carlos...I can't even look in a store window. We're walking down this street in Rio, we pass a jewelry store...I didn't even turn my head and he's in the shop... ...$250,000. I said it's crazy... but you know Carlos.You know where the powder room is, hon? I should freshen my face before I go in.My God! My God! Oh my God! Debbie rushes over to her.My -- my ring. My diamond. I took it off in the ladies' room to wash my hands. I was just putting it on -- I must have dropped it.Call Security! IN THE FUNCTION ROOM Tommy maintains his watch on Loretta. Zeke Bridges taps Tommy on the shoulder.My ring! My ring! Oh my god...!It's a diamond ring! A big diamond ring! Oh my Christ! She's frantic. Debbie takes Bruno aside.Of course it's insured! But you know how it works -- if I report it, they'll cancel me. And I don't want another ring! I need this ring! The ring Carlos gave me. Bruno turns, speaks into the walkie-talkie he's carrying.I can't go in there like this. God! Please... listen... I'll pay a ten thousand dollar reward for anybody who finds my ring. Just don't tell Carlos! He'll kill me.You took your time.LOOK...it's the ad! VIDEO...a cheap TV spot -- a busty blonde in a skimpy outfit tossing her hair and pouting.I am Inga. I'm here from Sweden and I'm s-o-o lonely. I need a man...and so do my girlfriends. VIDEO...Scantily-clad babes to match the names. Loretta speaks along with the V.O....Maria, my hotblooded Spanish friend...Babette, the Parisian pussycat...and many others. So call the \"Girls of Many Nations,\" at 1-900-555-NATO.Tell him to call back. I'm basting. TOMMY grins mischievously and speaks into the phone in the husky voice of a SWEDISH WOMAN.You hung up on Paul? He's one of my best customers.C'mon Gramma...it's only my voice. They never actually meet me.Oh, ya, ya, God, you're so big! Uh-oh, I have to go now, my husband Sven is home early... Tommy grabs the phone. He pushes aside a protesting Loretta...Okay, Tommy, what's so damn important?You mean Vegas?What is this, a joke?And how exactly were you going to get your butt to Congress?Which is how?Hello? Who? The League of Women Voters? Sorry, Mr. Johnson won't be attending the debate. No -- no, Betty, I'm sorry, I can't tie up this line. Hello? The Sarasota Star-Ledger? I'm sorry, we're out of photographs. No, you can't, Mr. Johnson has just had surgery for a deviated septum. Hello? Ya, this is Inga. PAN TO TOMMY training a home video camera on a poster that reads JEFF JOHNSON FOR CONGRESS.How do yo do. How do you do.Public liaison. She pronounces the word so carefully, it sounds lewd.Ken Korngold, National Distilled Spirits Association. Bob Rafferty ...Wisconsin Cheese Board. What do you want me to do?Herring, gentlemen?Really? We've got it in cream sauce and in wine sauce.The cheese guy didn't return my call. So I called the guy at the American Smoked Fish Institute. She points at the food table. There's nothing but a few boxes of crackers and two huge mounds of herring -- one white, one pink. The centerpiece is a large smoked fish, eyes staring accusingly.Please have a seat. The congressman is running just a little bit late. He sits and opens his briefcase. Van Dyke approaches him with the dignity of a superb butler.Cool. Mr. Newburg? It's Miss Loretta, from Congressman Johnson's office, how you doin'? On Loretta's bulletin board is a map of the United States, with flags, pushpins, and air travel routes.Say, the congressman's going to be out your way next week... Palm Springs, the Bob Hope Classic -- yes, a celebrity player. As long as he's on the coast, we were wondering whether you aerospace people might want to lay on a lunch so you can hear his views... Uh-huh ... Uh-huh... Lovely. Now what kind of contribution to his foundation you folks thinking about?How do you do, I'm Miss Loretta, public liaison for the congressman.Y'all from the district? Up here seein' the sights? How'd you folks like some gallery passes? Go on over and listen to the great debates of our day? She reaches into Van Dyke's desk drawer to get some passes.How 'bout a House key ring for each of you? Here -- see that? Isn't that something? Turns into a pen.You aren't with some organization, are you, honey?Oh, Armando? Could you come out front, please? Tommy enters, carrying an enormous tennis trophy.You sure they don't want to be alone, Reinhardt?Well, as I live and breathe. Tommy! Tommy is surprised to see them. She flashes a smile at Marshall.Pleasure to meet you.Tell you the truth, nothing for me.Excellent idea.Good night, y'all. They leave.Come on, honey, no use you getting mugged. INT. MARSHALL'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT MARSHALL and LORETTA \"I once was lost, but now am found; was blind, but now I see... \" Tommy, in the back, cradles his head. As Loretta heads into a traffic circle, she SEESCheck out the fuck-me pumps on that. Mm-mm. I gotta get me some shoes like that.Hot damn -- I knew my driving wasn't that bad. Speaking of which -- you think I should wear one of those whiplash things, Tommy? There some insurance angle I should be working here?We gonna git that sucker.Shit, that's right, Tommy -- these politicians are serious slick fish.Wait a minute -- we need a new roper, don't we? Everyone around here knows our faces. Outside a HORN sounds . Tommy looks at his watch.Office of the Adminstrator. Thank you, I'll put you right through. She hands the phone to Tommy, who mimics the George Plimpton voice.I'll just put you through to him. She passes the phone to Tommy.This is Cynthia Leeson in the White House Press Office.

No one could have been a better legislator. No one could have been a finer husband and father. And now -- He presses the tips of his fingers together and looks skyward, as if communing with his memory of the deceased.And now God has called his servant home. ANGLE ON Jennifer, in black.We will miss him. But we are grateful that his passing was so peaceful -- and so like him -- working late into the night at his desk, the consummate public servant.Vera, I know you're still in shock from Jeff's... passing. But we have to talk about his seat. Vera stares at Jennifer. She knows the score.Vera, I'd like you to announce that you're going to run for Congress. Let a few days pass to show proper respect. But next week, I want to stand next to you at a press conference where you declare for Jeff's seat in the House.There's nothing to be afraid of, Vera. With your name, you can't lose. People around these parts are so used to voting for Jeff Johnson -- why, Mrs. Jeff Johnson would win in a walk.Vera, we're talking about becoming a Member of Congress. We're talking about a sure thing.Tonight we unite the two great pillars of our system -- political and financial. To the forty-four newly-elected Members of Congress, I say, Look around you tonight. Look around, and be thankful for the generosity. Tommy inspects the sea of barracudas.The people you see not only provided tonight's hospitality. They are the people you serve. That's our system of checks and balances at its best. Their support helped get you elected... your work will help them... and their support will help you in your next campaign, which I remind you is already less than two years away. INT./EXT. ADIRONDACKS - LARGE DOORS - NIGHT In b.g., the Capitol dome. As Tommy and Loretta leave, they pass Dick Dodge, who is saying goodnight to guests. He stops them.You know, Mr. Johnson, it's customary for new Members to pay a courtesy call on the old fogies in the leadership. Especially from their HOME STATE.How do you do? You could make up for it by having a nightcap with me. May I have my car take you home? EXT. CAPITOL HILL - NIGHT Tommy and Dodge walk up steps toward the Capitol. INT. HALLWAY - CAPITOL - NIGHT A darkened hallway. A hand-lettered sign by a door reads COMMITTEE ON POWER AND INDUSTRY. THE CHAIRMAN. MR. DODGE. Tommy and Dodge approach. As Dodge unlocks the door:No. No, it's not. But -- Good thinking, Johnson. I'm impressed by your instincts. INT. DODGE'S OFFICE - CAPITOL - NIGHT A single table lamp lights Dick Dodge's office, reflecting off the velvet drapes, sculpted ceiling, and crystal chandeliers. Tommy and Dodge are in leather armchairs, ties undone. On the table between them, a bottle of Jim Beam. Dodge casts a cool eye on Tommy.Tell me, Johnson. Why did you come to Washington?Cut the bullshit, Johnson. I saw how you got elected. Flukes like you are either nutcases or troublemakers. I just want to know which one I have on my hands. Who sent you here?You pulled off that upset on your own?I'm impressed, Johnson, I am. But why did you run for Congress?No bullshit.What a refreshing answer. He laughs again, richly amused. Tommy joins in the laughter.I heard in the steam room you're going to try to screw up my ethics bill.Come on, Eli, your amendments don't have a chance in hell to pass. My bill isn't perfect, I know, but it'll pass. And the President'll sign it.Because the public wants an ethics bill! So that's what we call it.Come on, Eli, you're a politician, too. The less you're going to do about something, the more you have to talk about it. You know that. They start walking.That's the beauty of it! They must, Eli -- they keep re-electing us.Oh, I wouldn't read too much into that. A few extra retirements, some redistricting -- nothing more than that. It's still business as usual up here. Dodge takes his glasses from his pocket and wipes them.I live in the real world, Eli. Do you? What's unemployment up to in your district? Eight percent? Eight-five?Power and Enterprise is about to fund a solar demonstration plant, Eli. It could mean a whole lot to a district -- new jobs, new construction -- that interest you?Eli, the people who elected you. They sent you here to help them. Don't you want to?Come on board, Eli. You know -- you can't save the world if you can't save your seat. Tommy enters. Marshall gives him a once-over and extends a hand.Eli, you'll excuse us -- we have a meeting. INT. DODGE'S OFFICE - DAYJohnson, I'm the chairman of a committee up here called Power and Industry. We've got an open seat, and I was wondering if you'd consider filling it.Well, it is a difficult assignment -- look at what we cover: energy, health, telecommunications, environment... the committee is constantly beset by a swarm of special interests. These are powerful people, they've got all the money in the world, and they're not shy about using it.Most members would give their right nut for it.Congressman... I just want you to smile for the cameras. INT. POWER AND ENTERPRISE COMMITTEE - DAY The committee members -- all white males, except Tommy -- mill around, awaiting the start of the hearings. As the TV cameras whir, Dodge shakes Tommy's hand warmly. Big smiles and an explosion of flashbulbs. Dodge breaks off and Tommy drifts over to Reinhardt.Tommy, someone I want you to meet... Dodge steers TJ to a preppy-looking man at the witness table -- BARCLAY \"SKEETER\" WARBURTON.Skeeter, do you know Tommy Johnson? Meet the new member of the committee. Tommy, this is Barclay Warburton.This EPA oversight hearing of the Committee on Power and Industry will come to order. I'd like to welcome our first witness, the distinguished Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency... ... but before I do, I note that a new Member is joining us today, the distinguished gentleman from Florida.Now let me get this straight. You voted to make people on Medicare pay more money to their doctors?Tommy -- if I'm not mistaken, you wouldn't be here without the good senior citizens of your district. You got to dance with the girl that brung you, son. If you have a bit of business to do, do it quietly... in the corridors... in the subcommittees... with little amendments. You mess around on the big ones like Medicare, you'll be dead meat on election day.Do you know what your problem is, son? You don't think big enough. You have a real knack for this town, but you have the soul of a two-bit hustler. Listen to me, Tommy.Five hundred thirty-five Members of Congress. Some are smart, and some stupid. Some good, some not. But all of them, son, all of them consumed by the single overriding imperative that defines the very Washington way of life.Getting re-elected.You don't know what percent of the incumbents who ran last time got re-elected, do you?Ninety-six. And ninety-eight before that. It's like that election after election. If you don't fuck up, you can be here, raking it in, for life. Life, Johnson. Tommy considers this. Then a big smile.I knew you had it in you.Oh, throw them a bone... why don't you co-sponsor a bill for mandatory universal health insurance?Nothing. It'll never pass. INT. TOMMY'S RECEPTION AREA - DAY A couple of Lobbyists await Tommy. Van Dyke mans the desk. In come ELLEN JUBA, 40s, and her 13-year-old daughter, MICKEY, whose pony tail sticks out from her Florida Marlins baseball cap.Amen, gentleman. Amen. They turn, somewhat surprised to see Dick Dodge, who joins Iowa at the microphones, a natural leader.What a fine effort this is. I am totally sympathetic. Congressional hearings should be scheduled as soon as possible. The American people deserve no less. He puts an arm around Mickey.Message: we care. 112B INT. TOMMY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 112B Tommy and Celia are watching the press conference on TV.On the rocks, or neat?Well, why ruin good bourbon with the taste of some shitty Sears icemaker, that's what I always say. Cheers.Son, you're a real comer. I wouldn't be surprised if you ended up in the leadership. I'll say this: if I were Speaker, I'd sleep better with you as a lieutenant.But I'm not.Of course I did. We're all sympathetic to little girls with cancer. But I'm not sympathetic to holding an inquiry.I know what I said. But that was just a press conference, son. I wasn't under oath. The intercom BUZZES.Yes?... Bring them right in! Look. Son. It's great to get your name in the paper.I bet the gentleman from Iowa was all over the evening news in Des Moines tonight. Getting good press -- letting them know you care -- that's what it's all about. Smart move, Tommy. But that's as far as I'd go with this, if I were you. The door opens. Dodge turns to see Olaf Anderson, Tommy O'Connor, and Zeke Bridges enter.What a surprise!Mr. Chairman! Hello, Tommy. Zeke you're looking well, good to see you.Help me with these, would you, Tommy?Tommy and I were just talking about power lines.You really fell for the line that parents group fed you, didn't you? Tommy is struck by Dodge's intelligence.Oh, I keep my ear to the ground, that's what a good politician does. Listen, Tommy, why don't we just get Olaf's take on this.For a smart boy, you're not thinking very politically. Tommy watches the LIGHTNING.Yeah, the system ain't perfect, but the fleas come with the dawg.I'll drink to that.You see that ABC poll?President in trouble like that, he's liable to do something desperate. Some damn fool stunt.Hello, Eli, good to see you. Why don't you loosen your tie?Last time I looked, it was the Rules Committee in charge of that. This isn't the Rules Committee, Eli. This is the steam room.You know what your problem is, Eli? You've got sermonitis. The other Members chuckle.Can't open your mouth without climbing into the pulpit, can you? Why don't you just calm down, have a massage --I went too far with him, I know it. You know him pretty well, don't you?Come on, you play basketball together, you're seeing his niece, you've been to his church --He'll listen to you, Tommy. I want you to go make peace between us. Tell him we'll work something out on his amendments -- not a vote, I won't go that far, but at least he'll get to say his piece on the floor. Just get him off my back. Can you do that for me?That's right. Is there a problem?What's wrong? INTERCUT Tommy and Dodge.Good news doesn't come at this hour.Were you driving?The girl from your office?Listen carefully. Tell the ambulance to take you to Walter Reed. It's a privilege they give congressmen. It's also the only hospital without a bunch of goddam reporters shtupping the nurses in exchange for leaks. They'll keep it quiet. I'll handle the police. You go home and keep your mouth shut. INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT Two figures approach one another in the shadows: Reinhardt, and the Taxi Driver who rear-ended Marshall's car. The cabbie nods. Reinhardt hands him an envelope. The Driver inspects the cash.He did.I did.You learn fast.Alright, son. This hearing of the Power and Enterprise Committee is now in order. The health of America's securities industry --Hello?I'm listening.That's very interesting, my friend. I've heard that, too.But thank you, son -- I'm glad you chose to share it with me. We do make quite a team, don't we?No, this is a stunt for the polls.If we got the EPA off Olaf Andersen's back, he'd be extremely appreciative.My committee writes the EPA's programs. We audit their funds. We confirm their appointees. I've got them by the balls.Oh, no, not at all -- just... persuasion. Strenuous persuasion.Persuasion, yes. Intimidation, no. But it's a gray area. Who's to say which is which?Of course. He should be in by now.Skeeter Warburton, of course. Always go right to the top, son. INT. DODGE'S RECEPTION AREA - DAY Dodge passes his Secretary's desk on the way into his office.Get me the EPA Administrator, please. INT. CORRIDOR/STAIRWELL - CANNON - DAY Tommy jogs along the corridor. A tourist Family stares at him. He explains his haste with a smile --I need a straight answer from you, Skeeter. Is the White House on your ass about power lines?Of course.Thanks for your candor, Warburton.Olaf will be at my office at five o'clock.Cool. Real cool. You just follow my lead. INT. DODGE'S OFFICE - DAY - DODGE, TOMMY, ANDERSEN,I see that, Olaf, I see that. But in this town, you pick your fights.No one will know.Of course there's no connection. Olaf's just making a contribution as a patriotic citizen. And in return for it, he's getting --Exactly. A little access, that's all. INT. ORNATE CAPITOL HALLWAY - DAY Dodge, Andersen, Tommy, and O'Connor walking along. Up ahead, a cocktail reception. On an easel by the door: HAZARDOUS WASTE ASSOCIATION MEET YOUR REPRESENTATIVE NIGHT.I've got to do a drop-by. You gentlemen like to join me for a drink? INT. ORNATE FUNCTION ROOM - DAY Dodge and Tommy work the room genially. Tommy spots Celia talking to some Guests and goes over to her.Let's work the room just a bit more.Evening, Reinhardt. -- he SEES Warburton.Well. Look who's over there -- Skeeter Warburton from the EPA. The very man we want to see.At a hazardous waste event? I think we'll go talk to him.You don't understand -- he's the perfect man.Nothing beats man-to-man.A public place. What could be better?While the iron is hot, son.Come on, son, we've got the people's business to do. He leads Tommy off to one side. Reinhardt brings Warburton to them.I've got a big problem, Skeeter.Your power lines investigation.We're off the record, Skeeter. This witch-hunt for cancer clusters is bad news for everyone.Alright, I know you're being a good soldier --Then let me be straight with you. You announce this study -- I'm not talking about the results down the road, mind you, I'm just talking about the announcement -- and there's broken crockery everywhere. Real estate. Utilities. Insurance. Schools. Local governments. It'll cost jobs. Uproot families.I'm glad we understand each other.And we'll just forget about that phone call this morning?Excellent. Dodge claps him on the shoulder, then heads off with Tommy, who is delighted to have dodged a bullet.You're bad.Worked like a charm. We scared him shitless. The investigation's dead.Why, thank you, son.This meeting of the Power and Enterprise Committee to consider the reauthorization of the Clean Air Act is now in session. Today's first business is a panel of national leaders in the field of utilities.Before I welcome them, Chair would like to yield to the gentleman from Florida for a word. If there is no objection from the Committee -- ? The gentleman may proceed.My courage?But I've... I've... I've done nothing new, nothing at all -- what are you talking about?Well, yes, thank you, but we have to move along, if the gentleman would --Will the gentleman yield?I insist that the gentlemen yield!I thank the distinguished gentleman. And I thank my fellow citizens. Our methods in this investigation may have been unorthodox, but together -- we have exposed a canker at the very heart of democracy.Witness is out of order!How dare you impugn my integrity! Everything I've done has been completely legal!There's nothing I've done that -- -- that these gentlemen haven't done! Committee Members rush to dissociate themselves from Dodge.You lowlife hustler! Who are you to talk? You got into this House through fraud. You think I didn't check up on you? He pulls a piece of paper from the pile at his place.Ladies and gentlemen, I have here some rather startling revelations about this Mr. Johnson before you. This man is nothing but a con man! A fresh BUZZ from the room.A common grifter! He's wanted in three counties for bunco! He's a convicted swindler! Some BOOS. REINHARDT emerges from his hole, encouraged.A fugitive from justice for card sharping, bookmaking, confidence games --The gentleman is out of order! The gentleman is out of order!

That's smooth. After ten straight hours on my feet making small talk and breathing cheap cigar smoke, that's exactly the kind of line I'm ready to fall for.Sure, sure, forget it. Can you just tell me, which one's Congressman Johnson?Oh. I see. So tell me, Congressman, just how deep is the shit I'm standing in? Tommy has to laugh.Celia Kirby. I'm the legislative director of Pro Bono.We're a public interest research and advocacy group. I'd like to brief you on our priorities this session. Can I call your AA to get on your schedule?I want an appointment, Congressman, not a date.No thanks. I really should be going.I'm afraid I'm busy.No thanks. Nice to meet you. I'll be in touch with your office. I especially look forward to hearing your view on extending the sexual harassment law to include congressmen.Thank you for seeing us, congressman, we won't take up much of your time. This is Ira Schecter, our research director.But you have people waiting, and --Well. She pulls documents from her briefcase and hands them to Tommy.These are issue papers. This session we're targeting auto insurance premiums, child safety, and food additives. As votes come up, we know you'll be hearing plenty from the other side. We'd just like a clean shot at making our case, too.So, we'll follow up with your staff in the next week or...Well, we won't take up any more...Well, we're sponsoring a bill imposing safety standards on imported toys...You want to do this in the evening?Fine.

Are we willing to feed our kids a substance that causes cancer in lab rats? More important, who gets to make the decision? Bureaucrats and big corporations, or the people whose lives depend on it?...And in the 1988 study, it was up to eight per hundred-thousand. Um...am I losing you on these mortality rates?Hmmm, that's an excellent point. Let me see something... As she starts rummaging in her briefcase, we TRACK AROUND to a COMPUTER SCREEN on Tommy's desk -- it displays THE EXACT WORDS HE'S JUST SPOKEN.Wow...you're right. Maybe we can get them to amend Merton-Simmons. RACK FOCUS...reveals REINHARDT in b.g., sitting at another computer terminal. He is typing in Tommy's responses, which appear on Tommy's screen.I see.

And it's not like I'm allergic to money...God, it's so embarrassing to come out and say it.Meaning. I need my life to mean something.My question is, how'd you get named after a Memorial?And how's the pursuit going?How about Sunday morning?I liked the sermon, Uncle Eli.It's impossible to know. No one's really looked into it hard enough.Why didn't they investigate breast implants all those years? What about those side-effects of that sleeping pill, Halcion? Why isn't anything being investigated? It's always the same.You got it.Don't tell me you're actually developing a conscience.No, that's not fair. Some people on the Hill actually believe in things, and try to do a decent job, and don't forget why they went to Washington, and who sent them.Make a stink.

Amend.\"Isn't perfect\"? Dick, your bill's the Incumbents Protection Act! How can you even call it an ethics bill?But it's got no teeth! It won't change a thing, and you know it.I see. We close the bank, we stop the rubber checks, we raise the prices in the barber shop, we stop fixing parking tickets, and abracadabra! We say we've cleaned up Congress. Well, I don't think the American people want what this place has become.Not anymore! This new Congress is full of new faces.Eight point six.You can't bribe me, Dick. INT. DODGE'S RECEPTION AREA - DAY Dodge and Marshall enter.Not if it means supporting your bill. All you want is the perfect platform to campaign for Speaker. Dick Dodge. Mr. Clean. What a joke!We haven't met. Eli Marshall.I know. The Florida upset. Well, now that you're here, what are you going to do with it? You gonna feather your own nest, or are you gonna make something of your office?Exactly what does that mean?No, do me a favor, don't tell me. I try not to get depressed until the second week of a new session.I need your help on the ethics bill, Leon. I want you to co- sponsor my amendments.That wasn't a yes.He took six hundred dollars off you that last hand, didn't he?If I didn't know better, I'd say you lost to him on purpose.You fit in real well up here. Too well.Give it a rest, Tommy. You've got a great jump shot. But everyone knows you're Dick Dodge's boy.Don't waste your outrage on me. I know what you are.That's not true. Some people here actually try to do something besides save their own ass.Oh, really? How so?Aren't you going to vote?The wages of sin is death! And to the man who values Gold over Goodness...the Lord allows no exemptions! REVEAL TOMMY and Celia in the front pew. Marshall appears to be preaching directly to Tommy, who wears a slightly sick smile.To the man who shows no respect for the privilege of walking this Earth, God allows no deductions!And to the man whose pockets are bulging and whose soul is empty... the Lord grants no 90-day extension! And when the last trump sounds, believe me, you will be audited!Hello, darling. Glad you could make it.My niece says you're not half as slimy as I thought.That would put you somewhere between a lizard and a toad. Quite a step up. Tommy looks from Marshall to Celia and back again.You shafted me on the ethics bill.It's a closed rule. I can't get my amendments on the floor. I can't get a recorded vote. I can't get squat.This is the U.S. Congress! The American people deserve better than --I've got news for you, Dick. I'm going to run against you for Speaker. I may not have a rat's ass of a chance to beat you. But I sure as hell can tell the world the kind of sleaze you stand for. EXT.

He put you up to this, didn't he?Don't shit me, Tommy. You're Dick Dodge's yes-man. I know what you're up to. This is damage control.You know why no one on the Hill drops a dime on anyone else? Mutual assured destruction. Our little gentleman's agreement. Everybody has something on somebody, so nobody has anything on anybody, because everybody wants to save his own ass.They think I'm a pompous ass.Shit, this place isn't about passing laws any more. It isn't about doing good any more. All it's about is... being here.Entirely mine.Would you care for a drink?Well, when a pretty lady shoots him down, an old man knows it's time to go home.
