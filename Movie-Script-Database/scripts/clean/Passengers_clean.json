{"Passengers": {"JIM": {"raw_line": "Right.Thanks. He shuffles down the corridor in his slippers, rubbing his face. Having trouble keeping his eyes open. Behind him, his pod closes up. Its screen reads PASSENGERJim. Yeah.Thanks.Can I just...Wait. Where are all the other...But I'm the only one awake.Then something's wrong with the other hibernation pods.So why am I the only one here?I need to talk to a person. A real live person.Someone in charge.Thank you.Not good.Who's flying the ship?The Captain. I want to talk to the Captain.Emergency, okay? Where is he?Come on! What the hell is happening?Hello? Hello!Hello! A SOUND behind him makes him spin. But it's just a window-washer: a robot with long spindly limbs. It moves past Jim, polishing windows. Oblivious. A sign catches Jim's attention: \"OBSERVATORY - Your Place In the Universe.\"We're supposed to land pretty soon, but it looks like I'm the only one awake. Is that normal?Right. And how soon are we landing?What?No. How long ago did we leave Earth?I woke up too soon.Neither do I.I'm supposed to be in there!How do I make a phone call?No. Long distance. How do I send a message to Earth?Earth. The HomeStead Company.I don't know. I'm emigrating to Homestead II. I have an emergency.Sounds about right.Hi. I'm Jim Preston. I'm a passenger on the Excelsior. Something went wrong with my hibernation pod and I woke up too soon. Ninety years too soon. I can't get back to sleep. Nobody else is awake. If I don't figure something out, I'm going to die of old age before we get to Homestead II. So help me out here. I'll keep trying to fix this. Maybe I missed something simple. But I could use a hand. Thanks. Jim pushes the \"SEND\" button. Sits back in his chair.Outstanding.Say what?No.I thought I was the only one awake!I'm Jim. Arthur shakes his hand.Whiskey, neat.Arthur, how much do you know about the ship?What do I do if my hibernation pod malfunctions?Yeah, well, I woke up early.And when are all of us passengers supposed to wake up?So how can I be sitting here with ninety years to go? Arthur's eyes take on a faraway look. His head twitches.But I am.Arthur, I'm in trouble. I'm screwed. I am completely, ridiculously screwed.Self pity? I'm going to die of old age on this ship!What do I owe you?Are you serious?I thought I'd figure something out. I thought it would just come to me.But I've tried everything.I'm your only customer, but you're always polishing a glass.Okay. Lay some bartender wisdom on me. I'm lost in space here. Arthur polishes the bar while he thinks that one over.You said it.Okay.That's not me.What are you telling me?Live a little. When he comes back around he gives a shove. He spins faster.All right then. He clambers into the cockpit.Yes!Yes!Another margarita!I am beginning to learn.[I be study the Russian.]You speak Russian!Well, I'm trying new things. From now on, every time I sit down, I want a drink I haven't had before.What's that?[I'm ready for today's new drink][Don't argue with me, robot. Give me a new drink.]What do you mean?There are no new drinks.Who are you? Aurora. He moves on, browsing people. Stops. Backtracks. He stands in front of Aurora, looking in through the glass. He glances at her data screen again.New York City. Journalist.Did you know ninety percent of the businesses in the world are owned by just eight companies?She's good. She knows her stuff, and she's not afraid of anybody.Aurora.A woman. A passenger.I'm not saying the universe is evil. It's just got an ugly sense of humor. It doesn't just crush you. It crushes you ironically.You get to fly to another planet, but you die on the way. You're completely alone, with the perfect woman right in front of you, just out of reach.Yes, Aurora! Arthur, I'm falling for her. I've read all her stuff. Sometimes I talk to her and I know exactly what she'd say.I know. I know.Arthur. Say you were trapped on a desert island, and you had the power to wish somebody there with you. You wouldn't be alone anymore, but you'd be stranding another person on the island. Would you make the wish?Okay. Say you figured out how to do something that would make your life a hundred times better. But it's wrong, and there's no taking it back. How wrong would it have to be to stop you? I mean, what if it made your life a thousand times better? How do you do the math?I know how to wake up Aurora.I'd be stranding her on this ship for the rest of her life!What am I going to do?I'm shaving off my beard. It's wrong, man. The whiskers pile up in the sink, wash down the drain. His face emerges from its mask.Seriously wrong. You can't do it. He's finished. Clean-shaven.Don't even think about it. I'm shaving off my beard.Okay. Aurora's pod hums. Medical data flows across its screen. Her vital signs re-start. Her pale skin flushes with color. Jim beats a retreat.Hi. Hello!Passenger. Jim Preston. He sticks out a hand. She shakes it firmly. Electric for Jim. First contact.Yeah, I...same for me.The crew's still sleeping. They've got a special facility. I can see them in there but I can't get in. Aurora stares at him.Just me.Just us.I have to show you something.The Observatory.The other passengers aren't late waking up. We're early. Aurora stares at Jim.It's not that simple. Putting somebody into hibernation takes special equipment. Remember the facility where they put us to sleep? Jim points at a pod beside them. A middle-aged woman inside.This pod will keep her in hibernation as long as you want. And it can wake her up. But it can't put her back to sleep.Not that I can see.A year and three months. Aurora covers her mouth. Her eyes full of horror.Aurora! He turns another corner and sees her. She's sitting down, her back against a hibernation pod. Laughing at her own tears.I shouldn't have told you like that.I just did. I woke up, my pod dumped me out, and there I was.I've sent...sixteen messages to Earth. A bunch to the Homestead company, one to the Space Administration, one to the United Nations. A couple to Homestead II, just for the hell of it. My phone bill's about eighty grand.With speed-of-light lag, fifty-six years. That'll be from Earth. Nothing from Homestead II until we're almost there anyway. Eighty years or so. Aurora's mouth goes dry. She swallows hard.The other occupied worlds are even farther away. We'd die of old age before they could answer.I never thought of other ships.The computer knows. Give me a ship.Round-trip message lag...ninety-nine years.One hundred thirty-two years.Eighty-one years. Jim and Aurora deflate visibly.You just came out of hibernation. It'll be a couple days before you're a hundred percent. You should rest.I'll walk you to your cabin.Okay.I'm in the Berlin Suite if you need me. She stops. Turns to look back at him.It was.Whiskey. Rocks.Aurora's awake.Arthur. Can you keep a secret?Don't tell Aurora I woke her up. She thinks it was an accident. Let me tell her. Okay?Good morning. Have you eaten?I'm a silver class passenger. The French Breakfast Puff is above my pay grade.No, I'm fine, really...Thank you. They dig in.I was hoping so.I looked around. It's the usual hospital stuff. Scanners, autodocs.Not really.You think they've got suspended animation pills sitting around?I looked at the manifests. It's mostly farming stuff, industrial machines. We're not going to find a hibernation facility in a box.No, we can't.I've been awake a year and a half. I've tried everything I can think of.No.No.Pretty much.I'm from Denver. Lived there all my life.A little of everything. Transport, robotics, industrial systems. I fix what's broken. On the emigration forms I'm a \"rate two\" mechanical engineer. Means I don't have a Ph.D.I noticed.Not all of them.Arthur, this is Aurora. Aurora, Arthur.Android, technically.Sorry.All right.What? She pulls him down the hall, chattering.It would take decades.That way. But... She drags him toward the Bridge.There's just one problem.Everything important - the reactor, the gravity drive - it's all behind firewalls. There's no way through.Sorry.Do what?You're what?Who are you going to tell?I, uh...I never really...No. Things were okay.I just wanted more, I guess. You know. More room. A fresh start. Back to basics.I guess.I'm a mechanic. A rate-two mechanic. We're a dying breed on Earth. But in the colonies, they still have problems to solve. My kind of problems. In the colonies, a handyman is somebody. Nothing there for Aurora to scoff at. She looks impressed.And there's room! Open country. Woods and fields. I like the outdoors. You know, room to grow.Can't it still be true?No, I'm in a desirable trade.All you see here is five thousand suckers?I see five thousand men and women changing their lives. For five thousand different reasons. You don't know these people. Jim walks up to a hibernation pod. Glances at the data screen. He covers the screen with his hand.This guy. Banker, teacher, or gardener? Aurora studies the sleeper: a barrel-chested man of 50 with gray temples and a jutting jaw.Gardener. Jim moves down the row, peeks at another screen, covers it.Is this Madison, Donna, or Lola? Aurora peers: a birdlike young woman with long red hair.Madison. Chef, accountant, or midwife?She's a midwife. I didn't know they still had midwives. They move among the sleepers, quizzing each other.Married.Sixteen, twenty-six, or thirty-six?Right.I don't know. Artist?You think you can see that?Yeah.And what's this amazing story?Big plans.Watch your step. I've made a few changes. Next to Jim's favorite seat there's a cluster of machines with power cables and hoses running to them. Jim and Aurora sit. A screen beside Jim lists movies.I got tired of running up to the projector room, so I moved the controls down here. Thirty thousand movies to choose from. I've only watched about five hundred of them. He taps a button on another machine, which produces a bucket of hot popcorn. He offers Aurora some.Popcorn? Aurora grins and takes some.What are you so happy about?Wow.I went shoplifting. In the corridor stands a cargo robot to which Jim has attached an upholstered loveseat. He helps Aurora aboard and takes a seat beside her. She's charmed.Rutherford! To the bar!Single malt, rocks. Arthur pours.I was giving you space!Really?!Oh.A highly ambitious failure.\"Voyage to Nowhere,\" by Jim Preston.\"A Spaceship Built For Two.\"Yeah, me too. Well, good night. He turns to go.You are the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. You're so beautiful it hurts me. She stares, shocked. Leans across the table and kisses him. Soon they're making out right on top of breakfast. A passing robot pauses to observe the scene - then moves on.You okay?I know. She snuggles in tighter, and he holds her close.I'm going to finish my survey of the cargo hold. See what there is to play with.Back by happy hour.Hello, robot. Hastily Aurora replaces the manual. Closes the closet. Jim appears in the doorway: tool belt over his shoulder, duffel bag in hand.Hi. How was your day?Makes sense to me.The cargo hold is full of pioneer gear. There's a submarine down there, can you believe it? Ships and airplanes and bulldozers. That's what I wanted, a world still being built. But I'll never see it. They sit for a moment in glum contemplation.Yes. I found these. Jim unzips his duffel bag and takes out a bouquet of long- stemmed roses. Aurora gasps. Reaches out to touch them.I cut them myself. Aurora leaps into action. She finds scissors, a pitcher. At the sink she trims the stems, arranges the flowers.You're welcome. She looks into his eyes.It's coming! Run!Closest we'll get to a star on the whole trip. Happy birthday.You heard the lady. Be right back. He walks away.What? She looks up, her face rigid. Her voice a whisper.Yes. I woke you up.I tried not to.That's a little strong...Aurora. He goes after her.It wasn't like that.This was real. I didn't plan this. It...happened.Aurora. I love you.I looked at my pod. A couple different processors burned out at the same time. I triggered the same failure in your pod. Short circuit across these two contacts, and then these two. And cut these wires.Just like that.Can I talk to you?Aurora. Aurora stops in surprise, looking up.Please, just hear me. Aurora rolls her eyes and resumes running.The day I first saw you, my life changed. I couldn't forget your face. I kept coming back to see you. Trying to know you through the glass. I read every word you ever wrote, trying to hear you. The day you woke up...When you woke up I had no idea what would happen next. I had no reason to believe you would see anything in me. When you did, when we found each other, this ship I'm trapped inside suddenly felt like a limitless place.My pointless life suddenly had meaning. Aurora skids to a stop beside a Deck Steward's station. She leans over the counter, finds an intercom terminal and grabs the microphone. A whine of feedback. She looks into the lens of the nearest security camera.Wait. Aurora. Don't go.I don't want to lose you.I slept through Tuesday?I'm going to kill myself.I'm a murderer.Aurora.She won't talk to me. She won't let me tell her what happened. How I fell in love with her. How I want to be with her. And I'm not sorry I woke her up. I'm not. I love her. And you know what? She loves me. Around the corner, out of sight, Aurora stands listening.What was I supposed to do? I couldn't live without her. It was now or never, and I chose now. I chose now.And I was right. But I woke her up, Arthur. I woke her up, and she says I killed her. And now she's gone. She's gone.You know what? You're right. I've had enough.Am I gonna be okay? Blindingly fast, robot arms straighten Jim's elbow. Wrap his ribs and arm with smooth white bandages. Jim shouts in shock.Thanks, doc.Iced tea.Got to get dirty to get things done, Arthur. If your hands are too clean, it means you're not making anything.Improvements.Wow. You do need a repairman.The control unit burned out. I took the one from the cabin next door. He throws a switch. The lights come on. Back to normal.All better. Aurora gives him a brittle smile and sits on the bed.So how are you doing? You all right?Jim Preston. Rate-two mechanic.Two years.Yeah.Thirty-two years. Eighty-eight years to go. Gus blows air.You have no idea how long I've been trying to get in here.What do you think is wrong?What do you need?So where you from, Gus?How old does that make you?But how long ago were you born?Yes, sir.I've missed you. Aurora stares, caught off guard. She gets up.The golf cart. Gus takes in the bank of batteries, the giant tractor wheels.How long will it take?Got it.I finished.Gus...Yeah.No. Gus sits down heavily, looking at Jim.She knows. Gus thinks that over, shaking his head at the idea.Here's your inventory. I'll be in the machine shop if you need me.We can replace them.Where do we start?That's incredible.You haven't seen him at all?Gus! Are you all right?It's a few things.Gus!He's not in his room. Aurora flips on the intercom, speaks into the mic. Her voice resonates through the ship.Where is he? What's he doing?No.How you feeling?Why are we standing by the airlock?Yes, sir.What's happening? Aurora goes to the worktable: its surface displays the diagnostic report. Thousands of faults and failures.Pod 1498? That's me!Ever since then, more and more failures. Faster and faster.We start at the beginning. The breakdowns from the day I woke up. Aurora brings up a map of the ship on the display. Red markers blink on the map.Power Converter seems okay.Scares the hell out of me.Gravity. The gravity plant gives us weight. Propels the ship. And it contains the fusion reaction. All one system. Aurora watches Jim as he walks among the consoles, studying the instruments.Not much trouble here. A couple of computers running hot.Gus's card should open any door.Wait a sec, maybe there's a reason the door... The light flashes green. The door begins to slide open. A HOWLING WIND sucks Aurora against the crack in the door. She screams. Jim grabs at her. A hurricane drags her inside.I think I'm all right. Look. In the center of the room a round column houses the CORE COMPUTER. There's a CRATER blasted in the machine.That's the core computer. Jim hauls himself to his feet, leaning on Aurora. He approaches the blasted computer. Reaches into the hole. Strains. A CREAK...and Jim pulls a melon-sized METEOR from the crater. An orb of pitted metal.A meteor.Yeah. The breakdown accelerates. If we don't stop it, the whole ship will go down.Gus said there's spares for everything. If we replace the core computer, it'll pick up the load. The burnouts will stop. Another BEEP. Another green light turns red.Aurora!What are you doing?We've got to get you down. The gravity might come back on. Aurora hadn't thought of that. She looks down fearfully. Jim swings over the railing. Braces his feet. Takes aim.Hang on.You okay?Yeah. That's bad.The gravity plant's failing. Internal field goes first. After that the engines die...then the fusion reactor goes nova.We've got to get the core computer online. Now.The engines just shut down.Does the data cable go in the \"bus\" port or the \"through\" port?Hold it! Hold it!Don't know. The core computer flashes to life. The lights come back on. So does the gravity. Jim and Aurora slam to the floor. Inches away, the old computer plunges down and embeds itself in the deck. Across the room the golf cart bounces on its tires.What's so funny?We have to replace the other burned- out computers. But we have time. Aurora slides her arm around his waist.What is that sound? Aurora stiffens, looking over his shoulder. Outside the window, a hibernation pod spins into view. A woman inside.The hibernation system rebooted. It thinks the ship's in port. It's ejecting the empty pods.I see it. He's not fast enough. The pod slides up and out of sight.The Captain. The sounds of the ejection wave come closer. Boom-chak.I know.Got it! The hibernation pod hums to life. Inside, the Captain opens his eyes. He stares in astonishment at the first thing he sees: Aurora, in her bathing suit and shirt, a disheveled angel.That's the last of the burned out processors. When it reboots we should be all green.I've missed you too.Hell of a life.", "clean_line": "right thanks shuffles corridor slippers rubbing face having trouble keeping eyes open pod closes screen

It's the middle of the afternoon. Are you drinking or not? He produces a cloth and polishes the bartop. In a startling movement, he glides the length of the bar, polishing all the way, and glides back as if on roller skates. Jim steps up on the footrail and peers behind the bar. Arthur's body stops at the waist. He's mounted on rails, built into the bar.Android, technically. Arthur's the name.Pleased to meet you. What'll it be?I don't know. I know some things.Impossible. Hibernation pods are fail- safe.Can't happen.Ninety years or so.Not until the last two months.It's not possible for you to be here. He smiles as if he's solved the problem.Sorry, Jim. My specialty is cocktails and conversation. Take your fancy trick questions to one of those Infomats. They think they know everything.Lot of self-pity.Jim, we all die. Even androids end up on the scrap heap. It's not dying that matters, it's living. This is your life. Are you going to live it or lie down and die? Jim shakes his head in surrender.Jim, the booze is on the house.Stands to reason.Sometimes you can't catch a break. Jim gives Arthur a thoughtful look.Trick of the trade. Makes people nervous when a bartender just stands there.You're not where you want to be. You feel like you're supposed to be somewhere else. Right?Well, here's the thing. Say you could snap your fingers and be wherever you wanted to be. Back on Earth, or on Homestead II.I'll bet even if you got your wish, you'd still feel this way. Not in the right place. Supposed to be somewhere else. That's not a crisis, it's the human condition. Jim takes a moment to consider that.Well, maybe not. The point is, you can't get so wrapped up in where you'd rather be that you forget to make the most of where you are.It's a big ship. You're always running around banging on things and yelling at the computers. Take a break. Live a little. Jim spins on his barstool, surveying the Grand Concourse.That's the spirit. Jim goes for one more shove. Misses. Falls off his stool.[Good for you! It's a beautiful language.]Of course. We have Russian passengers.Fair enough. Arthur mixes a bright green drink, sets it in front of Jim. Jim takes a sip and makes a horrible face.Something new.[I'm afraid I can't help you, my friend.] Jim thumps his fist on the bar.I can make two thousand, seven hundred and thirty-eight cocktails. You've had them all. The news hits Jim like a death in the family.Is that right?Who's that?Who's Aurora?Things may look dark sometimes...Aurora.Jim, Aurora's asleep.I don't know. I've never been on an island.Jim. These are not robot questions. Jim stares at Arthur in frustration.Sounds like a fine idea. You could use some company.Oh. Well, you can't do that. Jim buries his face in his hands.Jim. I'm here for you.Sure thing. How's your day been? Jim takes a stiff drink.Congratulations. You don't look happy.I'm a bartender.Evening, Jim. Who's the lovely lady?Aurora. A pleasure. He takes her hand formally.What'll it be?Good night. She's wonderful. Excellent choice. Jim drops his head into his hands.Evening. What can I get for you?You two look fine this evening.Very nice.What's that?Birthday cocktail for the birthday girl.I'd never ask your age in front of a gentleman.Is that so?I'd say you were pulling my leg, but I haven't got any.I remember your last birthday, a year ago. Jim was really looking forward to meeting you. Aurora frowns, processing this sentence - her smile fading.He couldn't stop talking about you, let me tell you. He spent months deciding whether to wake you up. Aurora eyes widen in shock.Oh, yes. Said it was the hardest decision of his life, but I see it worked out just fine. Aurora stops breathing. She stares at the bartop. Jim strolls up to the bar. His hand slides into the jacket pocket where the ring lies hidden. But Aurora's body language is all wrong. He stops, perplexed.Actually, today's Wednesday.What'll it be?Why's that?Who'd you murder?But she's alive. She was just here.I think you've had enough. Jim looks at Arthur as if he's said something profound.Hello, Jim. Whiskey?Coming up. Are you getting my barstool dirty?And what are you making?Chief Mancuso!

Below on the Grand Concourse, Aurora is turning in circles, looking up at the balconies.Passenger or crew?I'm Aurora. Jim's lips move as she speaks her name, almost saying it with her. Aurora. She doesn't pick up on it.Do you know what's happening? Nobody else in my row woke up.The crew's supposed to wake up a month before we do. But I haven't seen anybody. Jim swallows hard.You're saying nobody's awake?Just you?But somebody's got to land the ship in a few weeks. Jim's finding it unexpectedly hard to deliver the bad news.Typical. There's so much incompetence in these big companies. No accountability! They lost my luggage on the flight to the spaceport. I'm leaving the planet and my bags almost didn't make it! And nobody apologizes. Nobody even feels bad. Jim is only half listening - his eyes drawn to the spill of her hair over her neck, the line of her jaw.It's the corporate mentality. Where are we going? Jim yanks his eyes away from her neck.Eighty-nine years to go.We've got to get back to sleep.Nobody strands me on a spaceship for a hundred years. I work for the New Yorker. I'll write an expose so hot you'll need oven mitts to read it. Trust me.There has to be. There's always a way. Where's the crew?How long have you been awake, Jim?Oh, my God. No. She turns her back. Suddenly she walks briskly away. And breaks into a run. Jim watches her go, astonished. After a moment he runs after her.I can't even find the one I'm supposed to be in. Jim extends a hand. She lets him pull her to her feet. He gives her the sash, and she ties her robe around her.Thanks. Jim looks back at her, miserable with guilt.No, I'm sorry. It just hit me how serious this is. How did you wake up?Me too. We have to get help.How soon could we hear something?What about the other planets?What about other ships? Jim?Jim, you've had more than a year! There has to be a flight plan or something... They search the Comm Center and find a map table showing the Excelsior's position relative to the Occupied Worlds. Aurora fiddles with the controls. Interstellar flight plans appear: a spiderweb of starship tracks between the worlds.There! They inspect the threads of light - an icon on each thread representing a starship. Even Jim is excited now.How do we tell how far away they are?The starship Zephyr.The starship Andromeda.The Maximilian.That's the closest one.I know I should be working the problem right now, but I can barely keep my eyes open.No, I'm all right.Jim. Don't look so down. It's going to be okay. You've got me on the team now. Chin up, all right? Jim nods, speechless.I'm in cabin ninety forty-eight, if you need me. Jim watches her walk away.A year and a half? Must have been hard.Good night, Jim.How can there be no way to put someone into hibernation aboard ship? What if a pod breaks down?Well, I'm awake.I'm starving. This is the dumbest machine.You're a man of simple tastes.Oh, no! All this time? What can I get you?Shut up. I'll be right back. She gets up. In a minute she's back, setting a tray down in front of Jim: A western omelette with a side of bacon...a cafe latte...half a honeydew melon. Jim shoves his old breakfast aside.You think the crew members would know what to do?Could we wake them up if we got in there?Maybe there's another way to go to sleep. Did you check out the infirmary?Did you look for ways of going to sleep?Well, Jim!You don't know until you look. What about cargo? Maybe there's a hibernation machine in the hold.You don't know that! We have to think big here. Maybe we can build our own hibernation machine.You're not even trying!Well, it looks to me like you missed some possibilities. And I'm not ready to give up. She strides out. Jim watches her go. Reaches over and takes the Gourmet Fruit Salad off her tray.What about research articles, any kind of technical documents?Earth. The New Yorker magazine, office of the Editor in Chief.There's no way we're going to build a hibernation machine.And there's no magic sleeping drugs in the infirmary.I did find the gene bank. Five thousand sperm and egg samples on ice. I should be glad they do that. By the time we get to Homestead II, that little capsule in the freezer is going to be all that's left of me. We really are screwed, aren't we?So who are you, Jim? I'm going to be seeing you around. I should know who I'm talking to.What kind of work do you do?Neither do I. But a journalist doesn't need one; she just needs a way with words and an attitude. I'm from Manhattan, so I had the attitude.And the words have always been there when I needed them.Arthur! Lovely to meet you. She peeks over the bar at Arthur's mechanical mounting, the rails he rolls on.Dirty martini!What for? It's time to sleep. In the morning we'll think of something brilliant.Good night, Jim. Good night, Arthur. She exits.Of course!Jim! Wake up! The door opens. Jim stands blinking in his bathrobe.We'll go home!It takes too long to get to Homestead II. But we're still closer to Earth. We'll turn the ship around.We'll go home.It's our only chance of getting off this ship in our lifetimes.Where's the...navigating place?We can learn how to pilot the ship. We have all the time in the world.Oh.New file. My Voyage.I boarded the Excelsior on assignment. Maybe the most ambitious writing assignment ever given. But things have taken an unexpected turn. I'm not writing for The New Yorker anymore. I'm writing for me.I've been awake on this ship for seven days, awake far too soon... Dead end. She's reached the aft end of the ship. She crosses a lobby and runs back the other way....and I might spend the rest of my life here... Running along a promenade, Aurora reaches the forward end of the ship. Dead end again....in a little steel world five hundred meters long.I'm not alone. Another passenger shares my fate. A mechanic named Jim Preston.The other passengers will sleep for another ninety years. She dives into the pool.By the time they wake, Jim and I will have lived, grown old and died.Vanished, like a dream, in the blink of an eye. She falters, frightened by her own words.Why did you do it? Jim is thunderstruck. The game is up. He swallows hard.Emigrate. Leave Earth. I'm interviewing you.Interviewing you. You're the first victim of hibernation failure in the history of space travel. That makes you news.Posterity. So why'd you give up your life on Earth? Jim seems stunned by the question. He hadn't thought about it in quite those words.A hundred and twenty years' hibernation means you never see your family and friends again. You sleep your way to another planet and another century. The ultimate geographical suicide.Were you running away from something?So?Jim!Now you're back to advertising.You know how much the Homestead Company's made off its first planet, Homestead I? Over eight quadrillion dollars. That's eight million billions. Colony planets are the biggest business there is. Did you pay full price for your ticket?I see zeroes on the HomeStead Company's bottom line.Banker.She's too silly to be a Donna. I think she's a Lola.She has to be a midwife. There's no way you made that one up.Married, or strangers?I'd almost say sixteen...twenty-six.Politician, historian, or artist?It doesn't say. But I'll tell you this: I like her. We'd be friends. Jim looks at Aurora seriously.Don't you? Jim looks at the woman in the pod. Smiles.That was my plan. Travel to Homestead II. Live there for a year and see what emigrating's really like. Then back to Earth. I'm the only passenger on board with a round-trip ticket.No! I end up in the future. Two hundred and fifty years in the future. On Earth, which is still the center of civilization, overcrowded or not. And I arrive in the future with an amazing story.A perspective no other writer has. Literary immortality.The selling of the colonial dream.My friends threw me this huge farewell party. Everyone came. It was the happiest, saddest night. And look what it's all come to.I'm up two points! She cuts around him toward the basket.The starship's designers gave the ship a daily rhythm. The light is warm in the morning, bright during the day, cool at night. We need those changes. But I miss other rhythms. There are no holidays here. Every day is a day of leisure. There are no seasons. The sky never changes. A mechanical whir distracts her. She looks down. Jim's pet robot looks up at her with binocular eyes. It carries a note in a clip on its back. Aurora pulls it free. A handwritten invitation from Jim. It reads:Is he asking me on a date?You clean up all right yourself. You went shopping.A manhattan, please.Took you long enough to ask.Space is one thing I don't need more of. I've been doing research.I found a drug that would put us in a coma indefinitely, and machines that would keep us alive.But it's not suspended animation. We'd still be aging.Yeah. If I have to grow old on this ship, I'd at least like to be awake for it. So that was a failure.There's the title of my memoir. \"A Highly Ambitious Failure,\" by Aurora Dunn. Jim laughs. He thinks for a minute.Incredible. They sit at the best table. Robots attend to their every need. The blue stars frame Jim's head; the pink, Aurora's. Beautiful dishes arrive: new wines with every course.Rutherford, stop! The robot stops. She pulls Jim off.Come on, we have to do this! She pulls him to the photo booth. They tumble inside. As the strobe flashes, she kisses him hard. Outside, the photo strip drops into the tray: four color pictures. In the first they laugh; in the second they clown; in the third, they kiss. In the last image, Aurora smiles at the camera; Jim looks at Aurora. Aurora taps the pictures: they start to move: each is a one- second movie clip. The pictures laugh, and clown, and kiss.Thank you. I had an amazing time. A great night.Jim. He turns back. Aurora grabs him and drags him into her cabin.This is so good. I'm starving. Last night was just what I needed.Yes, I'm fine. It's just...Be careful.The Polynesians set out into the Pacific Ocean with no destination. Searching for islands. They sailed into the endless sea on faith.Some never returned, but others found land, and prospered. What drove them out onto the sea? Curiosity? Tradition? The wish for something better? Jim opens cargo containers. He finds ingots of metal, computer components, spools of superconducting wire. Raw materials for a young world.The urge to move is as primal as hunger or thirst. We run, we drive, we sail, we fly. Jim finds a stash of utility golf carts and his eyes light up. He unpacks one, starts it up. Drives off into the dark.Is it movement that we need? Or the possibility of something new?I'm writing, Arthur. Hush. Aurora's slate has recorded this exchange: she erases the extra words with her fingertip.Like seeds, we carry what we need. The wind drives us - whether the trade winds, the solar winds, or the winds of chance. The next aisle holds plants in stasis: saplings in tubes, seedlings in individual vials. Jim stops in front of a glass case. Rosy light bathes his face. He smiles. We don't see why.We take root where we fall. And helplessly we grow.Hi.I don't know. I wrote a few pages. I'm not sure what I'm doing anymore. I was writing a book, and I was keeping a diary. But the book and the diary are running together. I think I'm writing about us.I'm not sure I want to write about this life. I don't even know how to think about it. I live in a palace. But it's also a prison. I'm moving at half the speed of light and I can't go anywhere! Jim takes that in.Did you find anything that could help us?Are they real?Thank you.For very unlucky people, we got pretty lucky.Aren't you going to check my I.D.? I might not be old enough to drink.Jim's not a gentleman. Anyway there's no secrets between me and Jim.You know what I like about you, Arthur? You have a sense of occasion. I bet ladies fall for you on every trip.What?What do you mean, he was looking forward to it? How could he...Jim woke me up.Did you wake me up, Jim? Jim's hand slides out of his jacket pocket. He shoots a look at Arthur, who smiles back, oblivious. Aurora's eyes bore into him. Finally Jim finds his voice.You pulled me out of hibernation. You destroyed the rest of my life. You murdered me!You murdered me. I'm going to be sick. Oh, my God. I...I can't see. She gets up to leave.Get away from me! She slaps at him blindly, almost hysterical. Stumbles away.What was it like? And you had it all planned out! Dinner and movies and our big date...Oh, my God! And I just ate it up. Fake! All fake!This is sick. Show me how you did it.So?Just like that.I'm so stupid. I fell for all of it. I fell for you. I thought you saved me. But you didn't save me, Jim. You did this to me. And now I'm stuck with you. Stuck with the second-rate mechanic who ruined my life.I don't want to talk anymore. I don't want to look at you anymore. If you see me coming, get out of my way. If you see me sitting, find somewhere else to be. There's plenty of choices. It's a big boat.Watching me through a robot is creepy, Jim. Cut it out.That's great, Jim. Just great. I'm glad that ruining my life somehow improved yours. But I have a run to finish, so...You may be the only game in town, Jim, but that doesn't mean I have to play. Just pretend I'm not here. Because as far as you're concerned, I'm not.Jim, you lost me. She drops the microphone and walks out of frame. Jim slumps over the console in defeat.It's the modern way of life. We surround ourselves with people. A constant din of conversation. As if we need the mirror of other faces to see ourselves. The clamor of voices in our ears to reassure us that we exist. Do we need it? Can we live without it?I think the secret to survival is productive activity.We need to be good for something.A challenge equal to our character. With a snarl, Jim tosses the ring into his mouth. Chases it with a slug of vodka straight from the bottle. Swallows hard.Something worth doing.What are you doing here?Forget it. The bar's all yours. But I'd say a drink is the last thing you need. You're pathetic. Aurora leaves. Jim takes a seat.I haven't written in days. I don't know why. It's the old problem, I guess. Who's my reader? Who am I talking to? What's it for?I need you. The last thing Jim expected to hear.I mean, I need a repairman. Jim's face falls.I'm fine, Jim. Thanks for your work.Aurora. Aurora Dunn.A year.I was hoping you'd know something we didn't.Wait. What about diverting the ship? Can we go back to Earth? Gus almost laughs.So everything's okay?What does no lights mean?You should rest.Good night, Gus. Gus waves and walks off. That leaves Jim and Aurora sitting awkwardly on the same side of a diner booth. After a moment Aurora moves over to the other side. Looks at Jim across the table.Six hundred years old!See you in the morning.Can you fix it?Got it.Don't take this the wrong way - I wish for your sake you were still asleep - but I'm glad you're here.Thank you. Gus arrives in a fresh coverall, a steaming mug in hand. No signs of frailty. He hands each of them a digital slate.Yes, sir.That should be interesting.I finished the census.So you know. What Jim did. Aurora's chin begins to tremble.He told you? Just like that? And? She waits, trembling with righteous indignation. Gus doesn't want to get into this: he looks away uncomfortably.It's not forgivable, Gus. It's not. Don't tell me it is.I would have starved.So how did you end up in space?Don't you feel homeless?I don't think he's up.What's the treatment?Where are you? Gus, please answer. We'll be at the Concourse Bar every hour. I'm really worried.Where have you been?You look magnificent.Gus, just because some stupid machine says there's no cure...But you just got here. It's barely been a week. He takes her hand.Oh, God! Gus, no!Gus. I can't stand it. There's got to be some other way. Don't do this. Gus gently frees himself from her arms.There's trouble everywhere. Atmosphere systems, water systems, waste systems, robot control.It started two years ago. Thirty years with no trouble, then forty- seven failures in a single day. Structural concussion. System overvoltage. Transient pressure anomaly. Circuit reset, conduit 12. Sync failure, hibernation pod 1498.Whatever happened that day woke you up. She pulls up a graph of failures over time: A trickle of breakdowns that swells into a torrent.How do we find out what's going on?They're all on Deck One.The failures are all below us.It's beautiful.What keeps it in?The cluster of failures is still one level down.This should be it. Jim cards the door with Gus's shipcard. The lock flashes a red light and stays closed.Let me try an override code. She squeezes past Jim. Taps at the door's keypad. Jim peers through the narrow window in the door.Jim. Are you okay?A rock. They stare at the meteor: the cause of it all. A BEEP: on the Diagnostic Computer's console, more green lights turn red. New errors pop up on the diagnostic report.I don't get it. This thing hit down on Deck One. But there are failures everywhere.And every computer that burns out increases the load on the others.I'm trapped on a sinking ship?Let's go.Two more rows, then left! The cart squeals around a corner.First you connect the data bus, then the sync cable, then bridge the power and backup power...you're supposed to run a startup checklist, but Gus made a note. He says you can skip straight to power-up as long as you...You need to sleep. We can't make mistakes here.You just got sucked into outer space. Take a break.Jim! In the middle of the atrium, Aurora drifts mid-air, far from any handhold. She wears a damp shirt over her bathing suit.Whoa. Hey. Let's talk about this.To what?! Jim dives at her like Superman. Wraps his arms around her. They tumble through space until Jim grabs a railing.There's no gravity.Why is there no gravity?That is bad.Bus port! The blue one! The ship shudders violently, throwing them from side to side. Jim forces one cable after another into their sockets. Aurora tires: the computer slides out of place.Trying! She strains. The computer slides back into place. Jim closes the last connection. Slips out of the niche and lowers the clamps that hold the computer in place. He throws the heavy power lever. The lights go out.What's happening?We're alive! The engines rumble back to life. A distant, rhythmic sound begins: BOOM-CHAK...BOOM-CHAK...Jim! He turns. Stares in shock as more pods drift past the window.Hurry.Who's that?You don't have much time.Go go go! The wave of ejections reaches the end of the facility and marches back on Jim's side.Can we talk?You know, if it wasn't for you waking me up, I'd be drifting out in space right now with the others. And if you'd never awakened, the whole ship would have been lost while we slept. Jim shakes his head at the tangle of it.But no matter how we got here, the fact is that we're here. All I know is, when I have a good idea, you're the person I want to tell. When I wake up in the morning, I wish you were there. When I look at you, I just see Jim. And I miss him. Jim looks at her, moved and caught off-guard.I don't want to be angry anymore. I can't be. We've come through too much. No matter what you've done... the fact is, I love you. Jim reaches out and takes her hand. She watches him intertwine his fingers with hers. Aurora gazes out at the stars - the endless shining sky that enfolds them. She looks at Jim and smiles.Hell of a life.

"Who did that? Jim raises a hand sheepishly. Gus shakes his head.I can't even talk about that now. Who are you?Mechanic, huh?Gus Mancuso, Senior Deck Chief. Nice to meet you. How long have you been awake?This is not good.I always get a hibernation hangover but this is the worst ever.Two years. Ouch. You know what it means, right? There's no way back into hibernation.No. We're awake for the duration. How far along are we? You know?That's tough. Hibernation failure! They said it couldn't happen. And now three on one trip. Aurora shoots Jim a look. Gus doesn't notice.Well, let's see what we can do.Now you're in. Don't touch anything.We're on course....Whatever's wrong with the ship, NavComp's still minding the store.Three pod failures? Something's wrong. Question is what. He turns to leave.We're going forty percent of lightspeed away from Earth. To go home we'd have to come to a stop, accelerate back towards Earth, and then come to a stop again. It'd take as long as going on to Homestead II. Anyway, navigation's not for amateurs. Space is a big place, and a planet's just a little thing. Gus has a coughing fit. Wipes his mouth with his fist.Let's go next door. See how the old girl's doing.I thought we'd see a lot of red lights here. That would mean trouble.No, if everything was okay we'd see a lot of green lights here.No lights means big trouble. Diagnostic Computer's down. We've got some work to do.Right now? Cheeseburger.Never been so hungry. Worst hibernation hangover ever. Jim can't take his eyes off Gus. A new person.Grew up in Chicago. But I've lived on this ship a long time. The Excelsior's made five inter-planetary runs, and I've been on every one. I live aboard. When she makes port, I live where she lands until she lifts again.Fifty-six.Oh. Hang on... About six hundred years ago.Most of that I lost to hibernation or relativity. Doesn't really count. I tell you, I feel about six hundred years old right now. I woke up hard.I think I will. Tomorrow morning, eight bells, you meet me beside that tree of yours. Until I figure out what's wrong with the Excelsior, you work for me. Jim and Aurora smile.The CPU's burned out, can you believe it? Why should that happen? It's rated for five hundred years.You don't fix it, you replace it. There are spares for everything in storage. Make a note. Diagnostic Computer CPU. And a new cooling fan, this one looks shot.Thank you, sweetheart. A GROWL of gears. Jim drives up in his souped-up golf cart.What's this?This I like.Next bay is the ship's stores. So how fast can she go? Jim puts the pedal down. The cart lays rubber on the deck plates and shoots down the aisle while Aurora and Gus yell.Start `er up. Jim closes a circuit breaker and powers up the computer. A deep electrical HUM as the machine boots up. The screen flashes a message: RUNNING VESSEL DIAGNOSTIC. A progress bar shows that the diagnostic is 0.0% complete. The lights on the indicator panel remain dark. The first light begins to flicker as the diagnostic runs.Full diagnostic from a cold start? Days. But it'll tell us everything.Good to see you too, Arthur.Just an ice water with a little lemon. I feel hot as hell. Gus mops sweat from his brow and sips his water. His hand trembles hard enough to rattle the ice cubes.All right. Last night I checked ten atmosphere stations and two of them were burned out. Twenty percent failure rate. Unheard of. So we're going to see how far the rot runs.I'm going down to the Hibernation Bay to look at our pods. Maybe I can spot what went wrong. Jim and Aurora exchange glances.Son of a gun. A sound behind him. Gus turns to find Jim watching. He looks from Jim to the pod mechanism and back again.You're supposed to be doing inventory.I looked at your pod. Very simple. The clock chips burned out. Not supposed to happen, but it's simple. Jim fidgets. Starts to speak. Gus cuts him off.My pod was complicated. A bunch of different failures at once, the whole thing went haywire. I think that's why I feel so bad. But this pod...You did this.I was thinking what a lucky son of a bitch you were, stuck with a beauty like Aurora. But it wasn't luck.She knows?I could see there was some trouble between you. Gus starts putting his tools away. Jim lays the electronic slate down beside him.Yeah.Yeah, he told me.No, it's a bad thing. But... Look. When a drowning man drags somebody down with him, you don't call it right. But he's drowning. A starving man steals a loaf of bread, what can you say? You should have starved?Really? Aurora looks hard at Gus, thinking, and says nothing.By Aurora's count, about thirty percent of the atmosphere station CPUs are burned out.We will. But they'll just burn out again if we don't figure out why it's happening.We wait for the diagnostic report. You've been knocking around this ship for two years. A few days more won't kill you. Gus hacks and coughs. For a moment his weakness is plain to see...but robots sweep in and lay dishes on the table. Gus sets his slate aside.Here you go. This is the best food on the ship.Only place I ever wanted to be. When I was sixteen I lied about my age and got onto a lunar shuttle crew. A few years later I moved on to planetary ships. Made the Venus run a hundred times, then Jupiter and Saturn. Then the gravity drive came along. Real spaceflight. I did everything I could to get onto an interstellar ship. I was thirty-six years old the first time I saw an alien sun. No going back after that. I've walked on seventeen planets in five solar systems.I'm a spacer. My home is where I am. You can't take much with you, so you don't get hung up on things. You have yourself. The things you do. The company you keep. Gus pushes himself off his stool. Momentarily shaky, he pulls himself together. He takes a seat at the grand piano and plays - a fine beerhall pianist. Gus touches a switch and lifts his hands: the piano keeps playing. Gus stands and extends a hand to Aurora. She takes it, and Gus sweeps her across the floor. Jim watches from the bar.No. No, I'm not.Couldn't get up. Weak as a baby. What does it say is wrong with me? The scanner's display screen lists not one diagnosis, but hundreds: disorders, diseases, dysfunctions.What's the summary?I'll tell you the cause. My goofy hibernation pod is the cause.Prognosis. A series of images flickers over the screen, casting shadows on his face. Gus swallows hard and looks away.How long have I got?Sorry, Jim. Gus puts his foot down and the cart squeals away.What are you doing? They spin. Gus stands in the doorway behind them.Guy's got a couple of days to live and he can't get any peace.Making arrangements. You kids have dinner plans?Xanadu at eight.Fine, fine.State-of-the-art machine, Aurora. Anyway, I can feel it happening.No point counting the days.A pure oxygen environment is about as dangerous a place as you can be. A steel pipe will burn in pure O2. And there I am with a hammer, trying to close this valve and stop the oxygen flow, when one spark will kill us all. But the thing is, O2 makes you punchy. So I can't stop laughing. And then the guys behind me start in, and soon everybody's going. Captain's giggling like a girl. The Navigator pissed his pants laughing. Jim and Aurora laugh. But pain contorts Gus's face. He grips the table with white knuckles. And nobody's laughing anymore.This is happening fast. I got some things for you. Come with me.I went through the ship's manuals and made notes wherever there was something special you should know. These should keep you straight. In a few days the Diagnostic Computer will show you what needs fixing. He takes his shipcard from around his neck. Hands it to Jim.This'll get you anywhere you need to go. Questions?Got no choice about going. But I can decide how to go, and I'm going out on my own two feet.If you knew how this feels, Jimbo, you wouldn't ask me to stay. Gus extends a hand to Aurora. She throws her arms around him.Jim. Fix the ship.And take care of each other. Gus turns and opens the airlock. He straightens, squares his shoulders, and steps inside. Turns to face them.All right. Aurora covers her mouth. Jim raises a hand in stunned farewell. The airlock door closes. Red lights flash. Through the porthole they see Gus look out into space. Then the outer door slams open and a blast of air shoots Gus out among the stars. His body lost in the infinite night. Aurora steps into Jim's arms. Lays her head on his chest. For a moment he holds her. Then she pushes him gently back. Meets his eyes sadly.", "clean_line": "jim raises hand sheepishly gus shakes head talk mechanic huh gus mancuso senior deck chief nice meet long awake good hibernation hangover worst years ouch know means right way hibernation awake duration far know tough hibernation failure said couldn happen trip aurora shoots jim look gus notice let touch course wrong ship navcomp minding store pod failures wrong question turns leave going percent lightspeed away earth home come stop accelerate earth come stop long going homestead ii navigation amateurs space big place planet little thing gus coughing fit wipes mouth fist let door old girl thought lot red lights mean trouble okay lot green lights lights means big trouble diagnostic ve got work right cheeseburger hungry worst hibernation hangover jim eyes gus new person grew chicago ve lived ship long time excelsior inter planetary runs ve live aboard makes port live lands lifts oh hang years ago lost hibernation relativity count tell feel years old right woke hard think tomorrow morning bells meet tree figure wrong excelsior work jim aurora smile cpu burned believe happen rated years fix replace spares storage note diagnostic cpu new cooling fan looks shot thank sweetheart growl gears jim drives souped golf cart like bay ship stores fast jim puts pedal cart lays rubber deck plates shoots aisle aurora gus yell start er jim closes circuit breaker powers deep electrical hum machine boots screen flashes message running vessel diagnostic progress bar shows diagnostic complete lights indicator panel remain dark light begins flicker diagnostic runs diagnostic cold start days ll tell good arthur ice water little lemon feel hot hell gus mops sweat brow sips water hand trembles hard rattle ice cubes right night checked atmosphere stations burned percent failure rate unheard going far rot runs going hibernation bay look pods maybe spot went wrong jim aurora exchange glances son gun sound gus turns jim watching looks jim pod mechanism supposed inventory looked pod simple clock chips burned supposed happen simple jim fidgets starts speak gus cuts pod complicated bunch different failures thing went haywire think feel bad pod thinking lucky son bitch stuck beauty like aurora wasn luck knows trouble gus starts putting tools away jim lays electronic slate yeah yeah told bad thing look drowning man drags somebody right drowning starving man steals loaf bread starved aurora looks hard gus thinking says aurora count thirty percent atmosphere station cpus burned ll burn figure happening wait diagnostic report ve knocking ship years days won kill gus hacks coughs moment weakness plain robots sweep lay dishes table gus sets slate aside best food ship place wanted sixteen lied age got lunar shuttle crew years later moved planetary ships venus run times jupiter saturn gravity drive came real spaceflight interstellar ship thirty years old time saw alien sun going ve walked seventeen planets solar systems spacer home hung things things company gus pushes stool momentarily shaky pulls takes seat grand piano plays fine beerhall pianist gus touches switch lifts hands piano keeps playing gus stands extends hand aurora takes gus sweeps floor jim watches bar couldn weak baby wrong scanner display screen lists diagnosis hundreds disorders diseases dysfunctions summary ll tell cause goofy hibernation pod cause prognosis series images flickers screen casting shadows face gus swallows hard looks away long got sorry jim gus puts foot cart squeals away spin gus stands doorway guy got couple days live peace making arrangements kids dinner plans xanadu fine fine state art machine aurora feel happening point counting days pure oxygen environment dangerous place steel pipe burn pure hammer trying close valve stop oxygen flow spark kill thing makes punchy stop laughing guys start soon everybody going captain giggling like girl navigator pissed pants laughing jim aurora laugh pain contorts gus face grips table white knuckles laughing anymore happening fast got things come went ship manuals notes special know straight days diagnostic needs fixing takes shipcard neck hands jim ll need questions got choice going decide going feet knew feels jimbo wouldn ask stay gus extends hand aurora throws arms jim fix ship care gus turns opens airlock straightens squares shoulders steps inside turns face right aurora covers mouth jim raises hand stunned farewell airlock door closes red lights flash porthole gus look space outer door slams open blast air shoots gus stars body lost infinite night aurora steps jim arms lays head chest moment holds pushes gently meets eyes sadly"}}}
