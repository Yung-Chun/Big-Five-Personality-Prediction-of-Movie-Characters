Where's the restroom?I ain't trying to rob you...Man, Day-Day is my people!Nobody!Shut up. I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin. They're right there in the back.Nothing.In a strange way, I feel responsible for Day-Day getting fired. If I wouldn't have fought Pinky, and gave Day-Day the joint, he'd still have a job.I don't know yet.Sorry about today, man.Wait. Check'em out.You see that?It's something in that hydraulic pump.Naw. I bet'cha it's something better than air.I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look.Could be. Rather be crazy than homeless. Now all we need is a big pack of baloney.It's about to work, just come on.That's what the baloney's for!What's the B-G's?Look, Day-Day. If we don't go over there and take a look, this might be the last night you got a home. Now trust me.It is easy. You know why? 'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.Well get along with this one. Go ahead of us.

I saw where they put it. Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.No, man, just wait.Huh?I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.Yes I did. Excuse me.Most of it. I just hate to see you in this situation.Why didn't she put'em out?I'm sorry to hear that.I did. Is that door locked?Make sure.I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.I be damn.Okay.Yeah, I'm cool. See you later.Have you seen Day-Day?Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.You see that?Yup.It's a long story. Right now we gotta do somethin'.That's a nice piece of heat right there.Come on.He's on the other side, sleep.I'm not sure, but I think they're in this room.Yeah, pops!Stretch it out.Ya'll mothafuckas help me!I love Fridays.You're welcome, Unc.You too.Nothing.Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous. make sure you get that car fixed.I don't know.

Hi, Uncle Willie.There he is.You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last? Up at the family reunion.Yep. I forgot about him cussin' out everybody. Damn that was fun.I know; this a long way from Watts. But what I like about living out here is that you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing. Just peace and quiet. Listen.Joker, he just got out of the pen. Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority. And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.Naw, them dudes is assholes. Especially that dog - Cheeco. Watch this little ass, he's sneaky. Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.Yeah, that's me. Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million. We bought this house and I spent the rest on this. It's the bomb, huh?Hi, Mulan.This my cousin, Craig. He just moved out here from L.A. Craig, this is Miss Ho.How do you know for sure?I don't have time, Miss Ho, I'll see you later.Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.Go on and make yourself at home. I'mma go get dressed for work.Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center. I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you. 'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.Aw, naw.Girl, you supposed to be 1000 feet from my house. What you doing over here?That ain't my baby!Awwwww.... Awwwww....I can't see! I can't see! Daddy!She pepper-sprayed me, man! She pepper- sprayed me!Hold on. What you doing?20 minutes?Yeah, I'm alright. Is my face still orange to you?I can't taste nothing.Man, it's a long story. I met D'Wana three months ago. She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention. Come to find out, she six months pregnant. Saying I'm the daddy!Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way. Worst day of my life.That ain't the worst part. Her little sister, Baby D. She's the one that gets real physical. But I got a restraining order on her, too.You don't know Baby D.That's the sister.I know what 'cha thinking. I thought the same thing. But it can't happen.Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy. And I'm just trying to keep the peace. We moved out here to get away from that shit.Alright, alright... I see what you talking about.Let it go.Just get the number and come on. Just get the number and come on.Cheeco!Oh shit, jump!Look at my roof.So.If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home. I gotta live here. Just remember that.Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited. But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired. You feel me?Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment. I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?Okay, sir...but where's the cover?I can't give you your damn money back on this.Well, you gonna have to go postal then....and if you come back, it's gonna be worse.Yeah, it was. How you get up here?You walked?Craig, this Roach. Roach, this is my cousin, Craig.You know what this is?How can they do this?Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.Don't worry about it, man. Get the phone.It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.Oh my God. That's D'Wana. And she got Baby'D with her.D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.You damn right that's the big one.You already in.No. You can't handle a girl like D'Wana. It's got to be Craig.Watch out for Baby'D.Shit.Fuuuuuuck -- U!Baby'D, you're not going to catch me as usual. So what can we do to end it this time? What you want? Another Big Pun CD? 'Cause I gotta get back to work.Anything you need.That's it?And I can go free?We worked out a deal. All you gotta do is go over there and talk to Baby'D.What was that?Thanks a lot, Craig.Big bitches need love, too, Craig.Are they still out there?Today ain't my day.Give me dat. I'm the one with the problem.I don't.Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint. I didn't even pass it.Ain't no windows in here.Blow.It works.Roach, what are you doing?Out the door and to the left.I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.I don't know. I hope Craig got a good idea. We gotta ask him when he comes out. Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.Yoooo, that's it. You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.Craig, what the hell are you doing?Yeah.I got fired too.Man, sit down.What we gonna do?Alright, Roach, see you around.Man, sit down. I can't think with you falling everywhere.Nothing.Let it go, Roach, trust me.Let it go!I didn't see nothing.Yeah, air.How you know? It could be anything.Are you out your mind? I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy. You must be crazy.This ain't gonna work. I'm going back.Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.The bubble guts. I'm so nervous it feels like I'mma shit on myself.Butterflies, my ass. I'm about to go home.You make it sound so easy.Hurry up. He didn't have that much baloney.Look at those tig-ole-bittiesNaw, you go first.No.I ain't scared of you. We ain't little no more.I hope to God that dog is happy.Wait for what?What you see?Wait here? So Cheeco can bite my ass off? Tell me where it is I'll do it.I got the B-G's.Oh shit.Roach...Roach, come on.He's inside the house?Don't worry about it. We gotta figure out a way to get Craig out of there. He's probably getting tied up now.You wanna knock?'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.What's wrong with you, fool. Stop kicking their door. They might think we the police.Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?Alright, no problem. We gone.Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding. All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar....and some rolling papers, that's it. We didn't mean to mess up y'all get together or nothing. How y'all doing?That's good. My name's Day-Day and this is my friend, Roach.Ya'll live around here?Shhhh! Roach, shut the fuck up.What?! What that mean?'I hope my cousin call the C.I.A.'Money? Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers. We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid. That's all.Why would he take it? He don't even know you.Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community. By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.Boy, you gonna get us killed.Get 'em, Craig!Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?They the ones you want.I know. I'm sorry.Where's Craig?Property taxes, and a new candy-apple paint job.What about me?Thanks for the help.Call me.You sure you don't wanna stay?I will.
