{"Even-Cowgirls-Get-the-Blues": {"SISSY": {"raw_line": "Sissy.Just lucky I guess.What about Crazy Horse?Going north?American Cheese. The king of road food.I was a successful model once.I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.Yep.I'm the best.When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.Right off, I don't remember how old I was when I found out I was part Indian. My mamma's family, a lot of them, had lived out West, in the Dakotas, and one of them had married a squaw. Siwash tribe. My pleasure in Indianhood and my passion for car travel might be incongruous if not mutually exclusive........ After all, the first car that ever stopped for me had been named in honor of the great chief of the Ottawa: Pontiac......NEW YORK CITY. It's still a helluva town....Tired...A born freak can only go uphill.I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?Bonanza Jellybean?Your ranch?A job for me?The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?But Countess...Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...I've never ridden in a cab. The whole idea of paying for a ride makes my thumbs hurt.I'm staying with the Countess.I don't.Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.As moving.No Indian blankets... no Indian blankets...Where are the others?Yes, thanks...This place is finer than the place I live!So this is what it's like... so this is what it's really like.I'm cold.It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. Nothing moves in here. Not even your birds.Getting dressed. I've got to go.I have to go, Julian.My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.I will hitch with you, out where tall birds wade in a lake named for my Siwash kin. Out where Smokey the Bear lay down his shovel to romp with more playful beasts. Out where starlight has no enemies and the badland wind no friends. Out where the boogie stops and the woogie begins.No, I'm more of an Indian The trio doesn't smile.Oh, I may and I may not. But seeing him is not my main objective out here.Yes I am.Yeah. I feel a bit hungry.Road food. How did you know?Bonanza Jellybean....Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.Tell me about it.About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.You're political, then?Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?What is Debbie's position?You don't agree with Debbie, then?Wait!Well, aren't you going to shake your whanger at me?I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...But I don't know how to polka.So this is how Jelly spends her visits to the Chink.What was that?Clockworks?Siwash, huh?The Clock People?Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?What do you believe in then?If this be adultery, make the most of it.I don't know anything about it.Brain damage? You mean he's going to be a vegetable?But Doctor.Oh, Doctor! You've got to do it. You and nobody else should be allowed to take away my gift.I just want to be normal, give me that old-fashioned normality. It was good enough for Crazy Horse and it's good enough for me.That's Jellybean!Howdy.Yes, but I want to be there. I want to see Jellybean. I want to see the cranes.So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?You mean...They're drugged.No, I guess not.But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.Fear in wild animals is completely different from paranoia in people. In the wilderness ecosystem, fear is natural and necessary. It's merely a mechanism for maintaining life. If the cranes hadn't had a capacity for fear, they would have disappeared long ago and you'd be having to get loaded with common old everyday meadowlarks and mallards.Dr. Robbins?If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....Is everything getting worse?The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?", "clean_line": "sissy lucky guess crazy horse going north american cheese king road food successful model yoni yum feminine hygiene dew girl got laid yep best younger hitchhiked seven hours stopping food sleep crossed continent twice days cooled thumbs oceans caught rides midnight unlighted highways developed grew concerned subtleties nuances style time terms longer interested began hitchhike akin geological time slow ancient vast moving stopping car car car moving freely clearly delicately sex maniacs cops blink let pass embody rhythms universe state grace right remember old indian mamma family lot lived west dakotas married squaw siwash tribe pleasure indianhood passion car travel incongruous mutually exclusive car stopped named honor great chief ottawa pontiac new york city helluva town tired born freak uphill ve proud way nature singled people deformed society feel sorry ve steady moving years months maybe rest spell young mean assignment bonanza jellybean ranch job food drug administration said wednesday female deodorant sprays cause harmful reactions blisters burns rashes fda judges reported reactions sufficient justify removal products market sufficient warrant proposed mandatory label warnings want pose want meet countess yes technically jack kerouac came awfully close afraid think makes think watercolorist develop romantic relationship okay ll try point ll try kind silly actually going artist new york city ve ridden cab idea paying ride makes thumbs hurt staying countess reside particular moving think traveling moving indian blankets indian blankets yes thanks place finer place live like like cold air conditioner making cold moves birds getting dressed ve got julian thumbs hurt ve mistake ve negligent haven exercised hitchhike little bit day matter like musician practicing scales practice timing gets thumbs stiff sore hitch tall birds wade lake named siwash kin smokey bear lay shovel romp playful beasts starlight enemies badland wind friends boogie stops woogie begins indian trio smile oh seeing main objective yes yeah feel bit hungry road food know bonanza jellybean er know maybe thanks breakfast afraid isn true jack awe tracked spent night talking hugging corn field hardly lover travel tell cowgirl word sound like painted radium pearl political chink huh ve gathered speak learned chink debbie position agree debbie wait aren going shake whanger friend bonanza jellybean oh trouble ranch came way dark doubt way help know polka jelly spends visits chink clockworks siwash huh clock people japanese called chink believe adultery know brain damage mean going vegetable doctor oh doctor ve got allowed away gift want normal old fashioned normality good crazy horse good jellybean howdy yes want want jellybean want cranes looks time guns actually prepared kill die whooping cranes business started birds nesting mean drugged guess peyote obviously affecting brains break migratory pattern goes thousands years fear wild animals completely different paranoia people wilderness ecosystem fear natural necessary merely mechanism maintaining life cranes hadn capacity fear disappeared long ago having loaded common old everyday meadowlarks mallards dr robbins flinch love problems confusion confusion students confuse teachers patients confuse psychiatrists lovers confused hearts confuse lovers clear hearts getting worse countess come aid rubber rose ranch officially deeded cowgirls asked oversee ranch week turns countess going vegetable doctors thought picture way ticket kansas city old story believe leave butte clock people inside information end world drop postcard going progenitor tribe living isolated ridgetop delores"}, "THE COUNTESS": {"raw_line": "I will send this out to Sissy, she should get it in a week, and you will be able to meet her. When I send a letter to Sissy, duplicates must be sent to U.S. Post Office Boxes in LaConner, Taos, Pine Ridge, Cherokee and that other place, for her to pick up...

Yes, sit right down. Would you fancy some sherry?Shit O goodness, I'm all out of sherry; how about some Red Ripple?You know what Red Ripple is don't you? It's Kool-Aid with a hard on. Tee Hee.To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see, from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.Oh my dear yes, I bought a little ranch out West, sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder. A tax write-off, actually.Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.By the way, Sissy... he's a full blooded Indian.So she left town. Well, that shouldn't surprise you. Leaving town is what Sissy is all about. But tell me, how did she strike you?She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?Like what?What do you think?Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?Whose fault was that?What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too. But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to his toes. They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose that I'll have to write Sissy out on the road.You pathetic little cutesy-poos. Do you actually suppose this exhibition of childlike melodrama is advancing the cause of freedom?Then take it.Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?Sissy. You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work.

it.Someday...... if that Sissy Hankshaw ever shows up here, I'm gonna teach her how to hypnotize a chicken. Chickens are the easiest critters on Earth to hypnotize. If you can look a chicken in the eyes for tens seconds, it's yours forever.Just that in Heaven all business is conducted this way.Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all right. I've done a little hitchhiking myself. Ah shucks, that's like telling Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone. I'd heard tales about you from people I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops. I heard about your, uh, your, ah, your wonderful thumbs, and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac's girl friend...Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clich\u00e9s and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.About...Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. \"Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it.\"Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.Oh yeah, now that I think of it, the Chink taught me something about cowgirls. Did you realize that cowgirls have been around for many centuries? Long before America. In ancient India the care of the cattle was always left up to young women they called gopis. Being alone with the cows all the time, the gopis got awfully horny, just like we do here. Every gopi was in love with Krishna, a good-looking young god who played the flute like it was going out of style When the moon was full, this Krishna would play his flute by a river and call the gopis to him. Then he would multiply himself sixteen thousand times -- one for each gopi -- and make love to each one the way she most desired. There they were, sixteen thousand gopis balling Krishna on the river bank, and the energy of their merging was so great that it created a huge oneness, a total union of love, and it was God. Wow! Quite a picture, huh?That couldn't be Krishna, could it? A bit shrill for a flute. Just our rotten luck.Gotta run now. Delores says I'm needed. Somebody's here. Maybe it's the Countess.Sissy, cowgirl history is about to be made. I'm damn glad you're here to witness it.More and more people are discovering that cow's milk isn't fit for human consumption. Billy West says if we can produce enough goat's milk on the ranch to make it worth his while, he'll run it into Fargo regularly.......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwet\u00fckame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.Get the girls. He's gonna see me right now.Any of you ladies who would like to join us, you're welcome to stay on as a full working podner at the Rubber Rose. Rest of you get packed -- and I mean now. You've got fifteen minutes to move your lard asses off this ranch.You owe us this here ranch, as a token payment for your disgusting exploitationsGo for it, girls!Not one of these pussies has been washed in a week!Yep, the whooping cranes are here all right. They're in fine shape, and as you musta saw from your fucking whirly machine, unrestrained, free to go as they please. But this is private property and you aren't laying a foot on it. None of you.Just come back with a couple of people who know what they're doing and we'll let'em in for a nice close look at the birds.THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS BEEN DRIVEN TO THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION BY ANFROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.Let's celebrate!Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.Aw, come off it, Sissy. What do you mean, 'drugged'? Every living thing is a chemical composition and anything that is added to it changes that composition. When you eat a cheeseburger or a Three Musketeers bar, it changes your body chemistry. The kind of food you eat, the kind of air you breathe, can change your mental state. Does that mean you're 'drugged'?'Drugged' is a stupid word.This here discussion is destined to become academic. Because we've got less than half a bag of peyote buttons left and Delores's run ended up in the Mottburg jail. So any day now we'll get a chance to see how the whoopers behave when they come down, to see if the peyote experience really changed them or not. But in the meantime, I want to say this about fear.....Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.Well, what we got to do is one of us has got to go up that hill and tell them boys that America can have its whooping cranes back. Since I'm the boss here, and since I'm responsible for a lot of you choosing to be cowgirls in the first place, it's gonna be me that goes...No buts about it. It's getting lighter by the second. You podners keep your heads down. Ta ta.Better get rid of these. Might give those greenhorn dudes a fright.Right in the scar where I fell on a wooden horse when I was twelve.
