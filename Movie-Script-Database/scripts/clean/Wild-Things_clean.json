{"Wild-Things": {"SAM": {"raw_line": "We've come to the halfway point in my senior seminars...Come on. Beats study hall, doesn't it?Thank you, Jimmy.Something Kirk with which I'm sure you have hands-on experience.We've all heard the words, date rape, sexual harassment. We've talked about some of these things in this room. Our speakers today head up the Blue Bay Police Sex Crimes Unit -- Detectives Ray Duquette and Gloria Perez. They're here to give you what we hope will be a fresh perspective on these subjects, and to answer any questions you night have.This is one of the original buildings. We have the offices here now.Sam Lombardo. The first. Class of 'Forty-Two My father.Art. Say hello to Detectives Perez and Duquette. Art Maddox. A fellow guidance counselor.I have the feeling, they got it down already. They're a step ahead of us, Artie.If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda. I'll see you get a proper tour.Okay, you guys. Good work. Now coil those dock lines and I'll see you all on Monday.That's about all it's good for. That's the one to have.The Windward Passage. I crewed on that one summer. Long time ago.Hey, you're working for it. Least you're supposed to be.Well, you know. Figured I'd buy a Washing ticket, support the effort. That old Jeep of mine's kind of a waste of time, don't you think?Okay, try me on Sunday. I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday. You guys can wash the mud off.What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?A ride. You want one?We got room for one more, Suzie. You need a ride?I won't.Hi, Sandy.Can't. Got a passenger.I can't, Sandy. I've got to run.Sorry, Sandy. I've got plans.Swamp's where it's at, Sandy. Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of. You ought to try it some time.Eat a power bar.No I didn't. Check out the Jeep. It's nice and dirty for you. But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.In back of the garage.Kelly.Senior class fund-raising gig. I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep. Hey, come on. It's for a good cause.So, where you off to now?Jeez, that thing... Can't you...All right. I'll have to look for it.Give me a minute.Sly old fucker. How you got so big, wasn't it?Barbara?Counseling.Sandy... What's up?No.Didn't you see her this morning?So maybe I'm a one-woman man.Goodbye, Sandra.That's good, Jimbo. I'll see you on Monday.What's left of my sailing class.Talk to me Artie.... is accusing me of rape. Jimmy told me. Apparently I'm the last to know...This is insane.That's great. I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist. No problem... Shit. I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.Ken. I'm in some trouble. I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.What did you do to your neck?Georgie, hey. I'm meeting Barbara. She here yet?Barbara...Yeah, I'm okay.Good thinking.Forget it.I know how deep her pockets are, Ken. I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?Can't you take that stupid thing off?What's that supposed to mean?Nellie Gail Ranch...There's nothing for them to get.I just want my life back...Story's the same, Detective...I had to go look for this coupon.Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it. Anyway, I'm going through a drawer. I hear a car. I look out the window. I see Nicole driving away. I leave my room, and there's Kelly.Yes.Yes.I could, but it's confidential. Look, the point is, we didn't talk. I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.Yes. Mainly to turn her toward the door. I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office.Again. I think we covered this. I told her I was going to call a cab.That's right.No.There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house. There's phones there. I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found. I don't know... Maybe I should have called. But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself. I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.It is and I don't. Ordinarily... But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...Fuck you. This is bullshit. I'm outta here.I've spent the last ten years of my life working with kids. I love what I do, and I think I'm good at it. These kids trust me, and there is no way. No way in hell I would ever betray that trust.I've found that adolescents make the best liars. They're old enough to be good at it, but you want like hell to believe them, because they're still children.I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay. I lost the house. It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.Just like that?You don't think you're overdoing it?Lizards don't seem to miss me.How you doing, Artie?Take care of my lizards, Art.Kelly...Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning.You see. I couldn't stay, even if I wanted to.Thanks Ken, you did okay.Damn maid.Ahhhh!Jesus Christ, what are you doing?About six and a half million dollars.God, you scared the shit out of me. You must be crazy coming here.Jesus. Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.Now calm down. Both of you.From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental. I thought that was understood...Kelly, for christ's sake...The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...We have to stick with the plan.This is Sam. I'm not in right now...Kelly. Is Suzie there?Shit. I was afraid of that. She left this garbled message on my machine. Can you calm her down?No! Christ. Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you. You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...Then do it. I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight. We'll figure something out... Okay?Put Kelly on too.Okay. I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool. All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake. I'm doing what rich guys do. I'm spending my money. It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing. Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.Shut up. Don't fall apart. The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?Good. Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.Give this idiot something to do. Let him look into the Kennedy assassination.Next time this guy drags me down here, I'll sue you. You're goddamn lucky I didn't sue you the first time!You look pretty.Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right? I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.I'd like that.Suzie, it's okay. It's me.I was worried about you, Suzie. I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.No, no. Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play. We'll go through it all again tonight.This is a celebration Suzie, not a suicide pact.We'll chill out first, have a drink, watch the stars.Kelly, there's a beach blanket in the Jeep. Could you get it for us?Let me tell you about this boat I picked out for us...I'm sorry, Kelly. I'm sorry it had to happen like this. She was losing it...Are you okay?Hello.Duquette. Forget him...Yeah, he got her busted for possession...And you believe her?Kelly... Relax. Take one of your mom's valium or something. In another week you get on the plane. It's over. We're rich.So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead. Stay in the guest house. Skip the graduation parties. You'll never see Duquette. Okay? I love you.Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?How long?Maybe she used another name.I don't know what to say...Goddannit... I don't have to...Come here. I want you to see something.Kelly's file. Read it. You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.You're telling me Ray thinks Suzie was killed. I don't have to ask you who he thinks did it, do I? All I'm saying is, read that, you'll have a new perspective on things.Then -- I still had ethical standards to protect. They meant a lot to me. Now, I don't care. And no amount of money can buy that back.My ride. If you're not planning on arresting me, that is.Jesus. I wasn't expecting you 'til tomorrow.Yeah, well, you fixed that. What the hell happened, anyway?Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something? You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed. What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.Here's to no more surprises.Ray... you see that winch by your head? Take a couple of turns on it for me, she's luffing.Yes, we call it a winch. And these are shrouds, and these are stays.Come on, man. I'll make a sailor out of you yet.Jesus, man... You okay?Come off it, man... It was an accident.I can't.That was about as grim as it gets.But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...That was the same thing Ray said.Okay. Grab that winch there.What's wrong?Okay. Come here and take the helm. I'll get the winch.You know the place I'm talking about -- the big rocks?We gotta stop. I'm gonna come.That's not your line.I love you. Now give me the line.Yeah, real funny. You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.Buy you a drink?We?How...I think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them.You think that's wise?Well, Z guess one taste wouldn't hurt.", "clean_line": "ve come halfway point senior seminars come beats study hall thank jimmy kirk sure hands experience ve heard words date rape sexual harassment ve talked things room speakers today head blue bay police sex crimes unit detectives ray duquette gloria perez hope fresh perspective subjects answer questions night original buildings offices sam lombardo class father art hello detectives perez duquette art maddox fellow guidance counselor feeling got step ahead artie old pictures come time collection pagoda ll proper tour okay guys good work coil dock lines ll monday good windward passage crewed summer long time ago hey working supposed know figured buy washing ticket support effort old jeep kind waste time think okay try sunday going everglades saturday guys wash mud jimbo need ride ride want got room suzie need ride won hi sandy got passenger sandy ve got run sorry sandy ve got plans swamp sandy gives look muck crawled ought try time eat power bar check jeep nice dirty want wait minute mercedes leaving garage kelly senior class fund raising gig told em hose jeep hey come good cause jeez thing right ll look minute sly old fucker got big wasn barbara counseling sandy morning maybe woman man goodbye sandra good jimbo ll monday left sailing class talk artie accusing rape jimmy told apparently know insane great ll tell creditors rapist problem shit believe board going act hearing ken trouble need attorney know figured start neck georgie hey meeting barbara barbara yeah okay good thinking forget know deep pockets ken thought able save fucking house equity loan guess board directors bank stupid thing supposed mean nellie gail ranch want life story detective look coupon like said hadn expected use going drawer hear car look window nicole driving away leave room kelly yes yes confidential look point talk told appropriate time place yes mainly turn door told talk monday office think covered told going cab right strip mall half mile house phones cruised place figured probably angry want know maybe called like kelly care figured monday office ordinarily mean kid standing crying fuck bullshit outta ve spent years life working kids love think good kids trust way way hell betray trust ve adolescents best liars old good want like hell believe children thinking gonna stay lost house like waking goddamn nightmare like think overdoing lizards miss artie care lizards art kelly look kelly sorry know ve ve seen like coning couldn stay wanted thanks ken okay damn maid ahhhh jesus christ half million dollars god scared shit crazy coming jesus million thirty thousand thirty change calm seen got accidental thought understood kelly christ sake way gonna blow stick plan sam right kelly suzie shit afraid left garbled message machine calm christ listen kelly counting calm mean takes need kelly tonight ll figure okay kelly okay want hear ve got cool people think rich christ sake rich guys spending money suspicious sit let cop fuck minds shut fall apart people blow remember good telling people fuck idiot let look kennedy assassination time guy drags ll sue goddamn lucky sue time look pretty hey ve got spend right ve wanted live dive dinner thinking antigua maybe like suzie okay worried suzie decided time split look probably told little intended play ll tonight celebration suzie suicide pact ll chill drink watch stars kelly beach blanket jeep let tell boat picked sorry kelly sorry happen like losing okay hello duquette forget yeah got busted possession believe kelly relax mom valium week plane rich tapping phone dead stay guest house skip graduation parties ll duquette okay love isn law peeking windows long maybe know goddannit come want kelly file read going angry sexually confused girl threats mother life female lover identify telling ray thinks suzie killed ask thinks saying read ll new perspective things ethical standards protect meant lot care money buy ride planning arresting jesus wasn expecting til tomorrow yeah fixed hell happened shit cop teach disarm people shoot leg weren supposed kill christ sake kelly supposed framed killed telling like surprises surprises ray winch head couple turns luffing yes winch shrouds stays come man ll sailor jesus man okay come man accident grim gets knew like maybe killing kelly thing counted thing ray said okay grab winch wrong okay come helm ll winch know place talking big rocks gotta stop gonna come line love line yeah real funny wrong busted spot buy drink think things want think wise guess taste wouldn hurt"}, "RAY": {"raw_line": "Thank you for having us. We'll each talk for ten or fifteen minutes, then open it up to your questions...Let's begin with a question. What is a sex crime?I've got that two o'clock in town.You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide. You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?It's our job, Gloria.Yeah, well, maybe you're wrong about him. Maybe he's got it coming.Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.The one you bought at school.In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.And she wanted to talk.But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.And she began to cry. And you put an arm around her.But she ran away.But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her. Isn't that against the rules?With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra...Sit down, Lombardo.Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her. That's bullshit.We've got three. Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her. I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?You're telling me you believe the guy?I'd better return this.Seen any good gator wrestling lately?Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his. I don't imagine he gives a shit now.You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?This is where she lives. She wants to talk. Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all. I busted her once for possession. she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.It's a shithole. But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?Evening Ruby. I see you still got Walter. I was sort of hoping something had eaten him by now.Suzie called. You know where we can find her?Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.So Suzie, you called us, remember?No.It doesn't look like it.You saw the news today?Hey, don't back away from it, you were right. We did look stupid. What you were wrong about, is who made us look that way.Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial. Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right? So why not tell us about the affair? I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.I thought of that. Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo. Your reputation is getting trashed. You want to stop the bleeding. You don't want to sit in jail for three months. Unless...Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.The job looks okay to us. But look at it from his point of view. The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege. But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.Your old man graduates from Blue Bay School, you're not supposed to wind up there. Board of Directors maybe, but not in the lousy guidance office. Now. Point number two. I've run a financial on Lombardo. Guy was eyeball-deep in debt before this all happened -- trying to keep up with pricey trim like Barbara Baxter.Her father didn't leave her squat. The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.I flat don't like the guy, Glory. He's dirty. And I'll tell you something else. You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money? He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal. It was after the war. Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him. The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.You got it. The rich got richer. While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.I net a guy in a bar.Nice stroke.Curiosity, I guess.Actually, I was curious about how you see things working out, for you, Sam and Suzie.You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.I've been a cop for a while, Kelly. It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three. And then there's the love angle. I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money?Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.You're good. But you don't think that little ditz Suzie's gonna hold together, do you?You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie. You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.Yeah, they're bad for your health. I'm tryin' to look out for you...Well, you're half right. Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts. Somebody's got to go.You, Kelly, Sam.Is that what you think? You have friends? Is that what they told you?Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to. We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit...Here, Suzie. I want you :o look this over. Know what it is? Sam deposited his check, transferred the funds to an offshore bank, a numbered account. Not even the cops can find out whose names are on it. Think one of them's yours?He also put a down on some island property, and a lease-to-buy on a forty-foot sailboat. You're into sailing, aren't you, Suzie?Don't you see what this means? You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money? You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?You know, I don't think I ever told you I was sorry about your little friend... What was his name?Come on, Suzie, help me out here. You know his name.That's right. That was his name.Sometimes I wonder if you're really as dumb as you pretend to be.But you know what? I'd be keeping a clear mind right now if I were you. I'd hate to see you come to a bad end. Like Davy did.You heard Kelly say \"Sam.\" That was Lombardo on the phone. And you saw the girls...I don't believe I'm hearing this. A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse. They were acting. They were all acting, from the beginning. And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.What? You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter? Cone on. She bought the same story we did...You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish? Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath. And those girls are going to wind up dead...Guess I kind of lost it there.Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened. I did that once. I don't want to do it again.Been four-wheelin'?I'm not on your property!You say she didn't come back last night.May have been she just partied too much... But we'll look into it. We find something, you'll be the first to know.It's starting, Gloria. This is how it begins...I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?Just check out the car.You and Suzie used to come out here together?Lombardo ever come out here?I say something funny?Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...I'm going to be staying here, Jimmy. You can catch a bus up there at the lot, okay?People aren't always what they appear to be, kid. Remember it.Lonbardo and Kelly killed her here.Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there. But he's made a mistake.You don't think Sam could've put it there?How soon can we get something?Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.Kelly's next, Gloria.Will you do me one favor?What if I'm right, Gloria? What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong? What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?Stick with me on this Gloria. I need you...If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.The teeth doin' any talkin'?What about the blood?Second you get something on those teeth, I want itRay. What's happening?Where's Lombardo?The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan. Let me in. Now.Where is she?I'm placing your daughter under arrest.Suzie Toller is dead. You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way.I fucked up. I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder. I did her rights.Kelly went crazy, started screaming. I grabbed her, put her on the floor.Bit, scratched. But I had her pinned. She calmed down. I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick. She asked to use the bathroom.I told her I was coming with her. She nodded, like she understood. We stood up together.She looked shaky, but lucid. I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door... I think I looked away. A split second. Then, bingo. Just like that. She puts a knee into my groin. There was this coffee table between us and the wall. She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case. Thing had a glass door. I could hear it breaking. I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough. Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun. I yelled at her to put it down. She got off a shot. I took it in the shoulder. I... I had no choice. I returned fire. Two rounds, I think. In the chest.I went there to protect her...The teeth, were they...Buy you a drink?Nice girlfriend you had there.The bitch shot me, is what happened.Hey, what did you want me to do, die?Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle? Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it. We should be celebrating. This thing worked out just like you said, only better.Every cloud has a silver lining, partner. Here's to no loose ends.You mean this thing?I thought this was supposed to be a vacation. Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?Yeah, or get me drowned.That how you planned it? You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...You... You're...You're dead... for godsake...You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...Sam, for Christ's sake...Sam, for godsake.", "clean_line": "thank having ll talk minutes open questions let begin question sex
