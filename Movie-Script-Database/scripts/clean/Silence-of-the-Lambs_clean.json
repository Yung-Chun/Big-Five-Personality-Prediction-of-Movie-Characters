{"Silence-of-the-Lambs": {"CLARICE": {"raw_line": "Freeze! FBI!Never cock. Just squeeze.What'd I do?Good morning, Mr. Crawford.I hope so. They haven't posted anything.Not yet.Who's the subject?The cannibal...Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?Yes sir.And what is that, sir?I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.I understand.Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company.Clarice Starling. Yes, he did.Dr. Lecter... My name is Clarice Starling. May I talk with you?Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.I am, yes.I'm - still in training at the Academy.We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?He said - \"I can smell your cunt.\"Yes.Maybe they'll catch up.Did you do those drawings, Doctor?All that detail, just from memory...?Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.No, I came because we need -Five... so far.Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -I'll tell you if you'll look at this form. It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.No. You ate yours.No. I only hoped that your knowledge -You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth. Or maybe you're afraid to.Reasonably so. Yes.And the questionnaire...?Then please - do this test for me.What's that, Dr. Lecter?Thanks, Ardelia.Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.Mr. Crawford?It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.Right down to the kleenex I used. Sir, why? Is something wrong?I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But \"Split City\" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages. It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice.Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.Murdered...? How?I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.Well God damn it! You old creep. Creepo son of a bitch. Let Miggs squirt you and see how you like it.So no one's been in here since - 1980?I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.Would you hold these, please?Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?Good idea.Okay, Mr. Yow...That wasn't me.Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.Not yet! - just wait for me. Maybe in about two seconds.Well, Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore.It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor?Hester Mofet... \"The rest of me.\" Miss The-Rest-of-Me... Meaning, you rented that place.You put those - things in there. Paid for it in advance, ten years ago... Why, Dr. Lecter?Thank you.How did - It's nothing. A scratch.Why? Do you know something about him?Why don't you tell me about \"Miss Mofet?\" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?If you didn't kill him, then who did?Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.Because you weren't wasting my time.I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.I never thought about it.That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.I don't know. Is it?Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?Who killed your patient?Buffalo Bill...? Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.Where?I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.Sometimes.I will... I promise.There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...? What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.Like I have a \"knack\" for Dr. Lecter?You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.Gentlemen. You officers and gentlemen! Listen here a minute, please. There's things I need to do for her...Y'all brought her this far, and I know her folks would thank you if they could. Now please - go on out and let me take care of her... Go on, now.Bill...Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me...She waxed her legs, I think... A big girl, just like the others - but she was careful about her appearance...Two of the fingernails are broken off, and there's - dirt or grit under the others. She tried to claw her way through something... I'll scrape out samples after I've printed her.Think they were runnin' a trotline?It's a Fish and Game violation. Like poaching. There's a big fine.They do it lots of places.She's got something in her throat.I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...Thanks, I'm not thirsty.It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?Then have the lab check Raspail's head. Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.Boy, is that smart...Somebody's coaching her... They're trying to make him see Catherine as a person - not just an object.If the beetle moves one of your men, does that count?You really don't want to know.I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.Not lately. But maybe someday.You're sure?And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?Dr. Lecter...He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?But if he knew we have so little time -I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?You'll back me up with some paperwork? Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.I'm acting on instruction, Dr. Chilton. This is the U.S. Attorney's number. Now please - either discuss this with him, or let me do my job.I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.By the book, he's a sadist.Yes.They all were.She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.A moth... How did you predict that?If you help us find Buffalo Bill in time to save Catherine Martin, the Senator promises you a transfer to the V.A. hospital at Oneida Park, New York, with a view of the woods nearby. Maximum security still applies, but you'd have reasonable access to books.Best of all, though - one week a year you'd get to leave the hospital and go here. Plum Island. Every afternoon of that week you can walk on the beach or swim in the ocean for up to one hour. Under SWAT team surveillance, of course...Copy of the Buffalo Bill case file, copy of Senator Martin's terms. Her offer is final and non-negotiable. If Catherine dies - You get nothing.That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.Go, Doctor.The death of my father.He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.Quid pro quo, Doctor.Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.No. Tell me why.I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.Horses - and sheep...Two months.I - ran away...No.No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.On what basis would they reject him?How would he test?Yes, Doctor. Please.Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone.Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home.Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?I'm Clarice Starling, Senator. FBI.Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -Sir, doesn't this \"William Rubin\" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?Yes sir. I can find it by myself.I just left him.I don't have a name for what he is.Yes, Officer Pembry. I've questioned him before.I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.Nobody sent me. I came on my own.Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this \"William Rubin\", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.Then tell me how.He kills w-Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-No. We just -All right, then tell me how -Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -Later, listen, I'll -And - one morning I just - ran away...Early. Still dark.I heard a strange sound...I didn't know. I went to look...Screaming! Some kind of - screaming. Like a child's voice...Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...I crept up to the barn... I was so scared to look inside - but I had to...Lambs. The lambs were screaming...Yes...! They were screaming.No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...Yes...Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.Yes. I'll tell you.No. He won't come after me.It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him... Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...He's here, Ardelia.\"Desperately random.\" What does he mean?But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.What girl?Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?But why? He didn't weight the others.The first, what the hell did Lecter say about... \"First principles,\" he said. Simplicity... What does this guy do, he \"covets.\" How do we first start to covet? \"We covet what we see -\"\"- every day.\"He knew her...!Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would. I have to go to Belvedere.You do until six p.m.But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it...Thank you.Mr. Bimmel...?Sewing darts. You bastard.He's making himself a \"woman suit,\" Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -Where?Sir, that's great news. But how -Sewing...Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -Yes sir... I'll do my best.Yes sir. Thank you, sir...Mr. Bimmel... did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb, from Calumet City? Or John Grant? Did she know any men that sew?Who was her best friend, Mr. Bimmel? Who'd she hang out with?Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant? Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?Did you ever work with her?Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.I think so.Sometimes you do.Good afternoon... I wonder if you could help me. I'm looking for Mrs. Lippman's family?Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?Thanks.I think we may be, yes.Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?Did she leave any records here? Tax or business records? Maybe a list of employees?No... no, we don't.Good, thank you. Mr. Gordon, do you have a phone I can use?Freeze!Okay... Okay, Mr. Gumb, you're under arrest. Down on the floor, hands and legs spread, move it.Shit!FBI, Catherine, you're safe.You're all right! Where is he?I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up. Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -Shut UP! The other officers will be here any minute! you're perfectly safe now!Agent Mapp! Thank you!Starling.Where are you, Dr. Lecter?Dr. Lecter -You know I can't make that promise.Dr. Lecter...

"Starling, Clarice M., good morning.Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.A job's come up and I thought about you. Not really a job, more of - an interesting errand. Walk me to my car, Starling.We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.I don't expect him to talk to you, but I have to be able to say we tried... Lecter was a brilliant psychiatrist, and he knows all the dodges. Dossier on him, copy of our questionnaire, special ID for you... If he won't talk, then I want straight reporting. How's he look, how's his cell look, what's he writing? The Director himself will see your report, over your own signature - if I decide it's good enough. I want that by 0800 Wednesday, and keep this to yourself.Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?Every word, Starling? Every gesture?He mentioned a name, at the very end. \"Mofet...\" Any followup on her?Well? Why aren't you there right now?Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.Miggs has been murdered.The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless. Starling...?You don't have to feel any way about it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. Why not, what can they do? Take away his books for awhile, and no jello... I know it got ugly today. But this is your report, Starling - take it as far as you can. On your own time, outside of class. Now carry on.I'll take over, Patricia. You get some rest.He keeps them alive for three days.Why, we don't yet know... There's no evidence of rape or physical abuse prior to death. All the mutilation you see there is post-mortem. I'm hot, are you hot? Bobby, it's too damned hot back here...So. Three days. Then he shoots them, skins them - usually just the torsos - and dumps them. Each body in a different river, in a different state, downstream from an interstate highway. The water leaves us no fingerprints, fibers, DNA fluids - no trace evidence at all. That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one...A big girl, like all the rest. Went about 160... Her corpse was the only one he took the trouble to weight down, so actually, she was the third girl found. After her, he got lazy...Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. This new one, today... washed up here. Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.Good idea, but he thought of it, too. We've run simulations, using different vectors and the best dates we can assign. You put it all in the computer, and smoke comes out. No, this one is different. This one has seen us coming...Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.Why?Why not?Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.Okay, Starling. Let's have it.What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.Are you finished?Number One. Maybe there's a connection, maybe not. Lying and breathing are the same thing to Lecter. Number Two. If I'd sent you in there with something to hide from him, he'd have known it, instantly. He'd never have trusted you.Number Three, I didn't bring you along today just because you can do first-rate forensics. If Lecter is becoming part of this case, you've got the most current read on him. And Number Four - you don't have to like me, or the way I do things. But you do have to keep a cool head. Especially now... Because from here on out, you'll know everything I do. Are we straight on that?You think about him long enough, you get a feel for him... Then, if you're lucky, out of all the stuff you know, one little part of it tugs at you, tries to get your attention... You let me know when that happens, Starling. Live right behind your eyes, today. Don't try to impose any patterns on this guy. Just stay open and let him show you...School's out, Starling.Starling...?We're around back.Sheriff Perkins? Jack Crawford, FBI... This is Officer Starling. We appreciate your phoning us.Well sir, that's where we can help. If -Sheriff, this, ah - this type of sex crime has some aspects I'd rather discuss just between the two of us. Know what I mean?I need a six-way linkup! Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, Atlanta, and Dallas... What?... Can you hear me...?We're starting. Tell everybody to stand by for fingerprint transmission.What do you see, Starling?Get photos of her teeth. Then we'll fax her fingerprints to Washington, try to trace her through Missing Persons.What is it - some kind of seed pod?She'll be easier to print if we turn her over. Lamar, will you give me a hand?Starling - what do you make of these?They weren't there. Get close-ups.When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it? That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there.Point taken.When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -You seem pretty sure of that.Before we caught him, Lecter had a big psychiatric practice in Baltimore. But he traveled all over the country - teaching, consulting... Christ, even testifying in murder trials. Who knows how many potential psychos he turned loose, just for the fun of it...?I don't think he knew that she's a Senator's child. She's a big girl, Starling, like all the rest. We're going on the theory she was randomly targeted by size...By now, Bill's had her for 36 hours. That leaves us just 36 more, before he kills her... But maybe, just maybe, Starling, we caught a real break this time - thanks to you. We found another bug, in Raspail's head.Maybe we can trace how he buys the bugs, starting with U.S. Customs...Maybe we can locate some of Raspail's old lovers. Maybe, someday...But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.What would it take?State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?She doesn't know what we're up to. And we can't afford to let her find out.She's the mother, Starling. She can't possibly comprehend what Lecter is. She'd make the mistake of pleading with him. Begging him... He'd feast on her pain till the last second of that girl's life...We can't trust Frederick Chilton, either. He's greedy and ambitious. If he knew about Lecter's link to Bill, he's go straight to the newspapers...Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away.You want to see a violation? This is a violation...Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.In a minute!Look... search your own records, if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated.Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this. He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.Would you, Doctor? That would be so kind.Transferred...?Let him land.Let's get some coffee and talk.I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are... You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it. Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio. Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...He will...Who the hell's fault is -If you hadn't interfered, he'd still be in custody in Baltimore!You're just trying to cover your ass for letting him escape!You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.There's about $300 here... And a hotline code number. They'll patch you through to me, wherever I am.Starling -Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.Calumet City, edge of Chicago. I'll be on the ground in 45 minutes with the Hostage Rescue Team. I'm back in charge, Starling. He's mine.Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries. Subject's name is \"Jamie Gumb,\" AKA \"John Grant.\" Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was \"John Grant.\" Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.No, Starling, there isn't time. And you've still got crucial work to do in Ohio. We want him for murder, not kidnapping. I'm counting on you to link him to the Bimmel girl, before he's indicted.Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.Clarice.Starling... your father sees you.", "clean_line": "starling clarice good morning instructors tell quarter class job come thought job interesting errand walk car starling trying

LECTER": {"raw_line": "Good morning.\"We\" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.May I see your credentials?Closer, please... Clo-ser...That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.Now then. What did Miggs say to you? \"Multiple Miggs,\" in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say?I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?It's much better than your shoes.I have no doubt of it.Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?Memory, Officer Starling, is what I have instead of view.No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?How many women has he used, our Bill?All flayed...?Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.I didn't.Send that through.Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?You're sooo ambitious, aren't you...? You know what you look like to me, with your good bag and your cheap shoes? You look like a rube. A well- scrubbed, hustling rube with a little, taste... Good nutrition has given you some length of bone, but you're not more than one generation from poor white trash, are you Officer Starling...? That accent you're trying so desperately to shed - pure West Virginia. What was your father, dear? Was he a coal miner? Did he stink of the lamp...? And oh, how quickly the boys found you! All those tedious, sticky fumblings, in the back seats of cars, while you could only dream of getting out. Getting anywhere - yes? Getting all the way - to the F...B...I.You're a tough one, aren't you?And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it. Now please excuse me. Good day.A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.Officer Starling... Officer Starling!I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.Advancement, of course. Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T... Now go. Go. I don't think Miggs could manage again so soon, even if he is crazy - do you?Your bleeding has stopped.Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under \"Missing Person\" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own. How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?Ahhh... Why?Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?Not anymore. Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation? There's something Crawford can give me, and I want to trade for it. I even wrote to him, offering my help. But he hates me, so he won't deal directly.Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.Who is he stalking right now, Clarice? I wonder, don't you? How many more young women will have to die, before you trade with me...?Wouldn't you say, Clarice, that for a United States Senator, you're an odd choice of messenger?That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort? Or should I say, his \"next-to-latest\"?Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God. Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?Big through the hips. Roomy.Mmm. And what else...?Was it a butterfly?I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.\"Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center.\" Sounds charming.Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it will be \"turns\" with us, too. Quid pro quo. I tell you things, you tell me things. Not about this case, though - about yourself. Yes or no? Yes or no, Clarice. Catherine is waiting. Tick-tock, tick-tock...What's your worst memory of childhood? Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.Killed outright?You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next? I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.A cattle ranch?How long did you live there?Why so briefly?Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?Did he try to?Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?You should try to obtain a list of males rejected from all three gender reassignment centers...Check first the ones rejected for lying about criminal records...Among those who tried to conceal their past, look for severe childhood disturbances, associated with violence... Possibly you'll find a childhood incarceration... Then go to their personality tests...Study their drawings, especially. Billy's house drawings will show no happy future... No baby carriage, out in the yard. No pets, no toys, no flowers, no sun...His females will be more crudely sketched than him males - but he'll compensate by adding exaggerated adornments... jewelry, big breasts... And his tree drawings - oh, his trees will be frightful...Billy hates his own identity, he always has - and he thinks that makes him a transsexual. But his pathology is a thousand times more savage... He wants to be reborn, Clarice. He will be reborn...I'll tell the Senator herself. But only in Tennessee...Oh yes, Officer Pembry. I certainly do.I won't waste your time and Catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges. Clarice Starling and that awful Jack Crawford have wasted far too much already. I only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl... Let me help you now, and I'll trust you when it's all over.Buffalo Bill's real name is William Rubin. I met him just once. He was referred to me in April or May, 1980, by my patient Benjamin Raspail. They were lovers, but Raspail had become very frightened. Apparently Rubin had murdered a transient, and - done things with the skin. He thought if I could cure Billy, then Billy'd be safe from the police, and he's be safe from Billy... Obviously, he was wrong.Did you nurse Catherine?Did you breast-feed her?Toughened your nipples, didn't it...? Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.Senator Martin...! You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. It's such a game with these people. They're determined to get the arrest for themselves. The \"collar,\" I think they say.Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.Good afternoon, Clarice.How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?People will say we're in love. Pity you tried to fool me, isn't it? Pity for poor Catherine. Tick-tock...Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing, ask: What is it, in itself, what is its nature...? What does he do, this man you seek?No! That's incidental.What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?Not \"just,\" Clarice. What set you off? You started what time?Then something woke you. What? Did you dream...? What was it?What was it?What did you do?And what did you see, Clarice?They were slaughtering the spring lambs?So you ran away...But you could. You did.Where were you going?But what became of your lamb? Clarice...?You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?Thank you, Clarice.Dr. Chilton... I believe you know each other?Brave Clarice. Will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming?Promise...? Then why not take your case file? I won't be needing it anymore.Good-bye, Clarice.Just another minute, please!I'm ready when you are, Officer Pembry.Clarice, doesn't this random scattering of sites seem overdone to you? Doesn't it seem desperately random - like the elaborations of a bad liar? Ta... Hannibal Lecter.Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see...Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?Don't bother with a trace, I won't be on long enough.Where I have a view, Clarice...Orion is looking splendid tonight, and Arcturus, the Herdsman, with his flock...Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.Goodbye, Clarice... You looked - so very lovely today, in your blue suit.Well, Dr. Chilton.
