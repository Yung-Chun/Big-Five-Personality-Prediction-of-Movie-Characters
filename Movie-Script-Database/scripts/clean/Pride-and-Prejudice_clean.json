{"Pride-and-Prejudice": {"MRS BENNET": {"raw_line": "My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last? We follow Elizabeth into the house, but still overhear her parents' conversation.Do you not want to know who has taken it?What a fine thing for our girls!My dear Mr Bennet, how can you be so tiresome! You know that he must marry one of them.- So you must go and visit him at once.You have?\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 How can you tease me, Mr Bennet. You have no compassion for my poor nerves?Is he amiable?It is a pleasure. I have two others butOh Mr Bennet! I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself, and if a smart young colonel with six thousand a year should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him. Mr Darcy overhears this. Profoundly embarrassed, Lizzie moves away.That dress becomes her, does it not. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Though of course my Jane needs little help from couturiers. Elizabeth wanders through the throng. She looks at Bingley and Jane ending the dance - she is coy and demure, he clearly smitten -It is a pity she is not more handsome.But Lizzie will never admit she is plain.When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman so much in love with her that I was sure he would make her an offer. However, he did write her some very pretty verses.And then he danced the third with Miss Lucas. Poor thing, it is a shame she is not more handsome. The fourth with a Miss King of little standing. And the fifth again with Jane.Oh, Mr Bennet! Anybody would think the girls looked forward to a grand inheritance. Elizabeth rolls her eyes at Mr Bennet, they've heard this speech many times before.As you well know, Mr Bennet, when you die, which may in fact be very soon, our girls will be left without a roof over their head nor a penny to their name.Praise the Lord! We are saved. Mrs Hill gives the letter to Jane.Make haste, Jane, make haste. 0 happy day!This is most unfortunate.Certainly not my dear, you will go to Netherfield on horse back.Ah, good... The housekeeper, Mrs Hill, who is with her, looks bemused at her mistress's reaction.Excellent. Now she will have to stay the night. Exactly as I predicted.People do not die of colds.Nonsense, the horse is with Jane. And the girls took the carriage to town.Walk! You will not be fit to be seen by the time you get there.Well, my dear, its all going according to plan. He's half in love with her already!Mr Bingley! And he doesn't mind that she hasn't a penny, for he has enough for the two of them. Suddenly a distant trumpet sounds, dogs bark. The militia are arriving. Lydia and Kitty rush past. They are dressed up to the nines to greet the officers. Mrs Bennet's face lights up.What an excellent room you have sir. Such expensive furnishings. I hope you intend to stay here, Mr Bingley.But I assure you there is quite as much going on in the country as there is in the town.What a high and mighty man that Mr Darcy is, quite eaten up with pride.Mr Collins, we are perfectly able to keep a cook.Does she have any family?Mr Collins, unfortunately it is incumbent on me to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet is - very soon to be engaged.But Miss Elizabeth next to her in both age and beauty would make anyone an excellent partner. Do not you agree, Mr Collins? Mr Collins looks through the doorway at Elizabeth(refering to Jane andI have never had such a good time in my life. Mr Bingley you must have such a ball once a month at least. Caroline who is standing with her brother, yawns ostentatiously.Don't be impertinent. our hosts are perfectly happy with our company, are you not, Mr Bingley? I hope I can entice you to Longbourn to sample our hospitality. We would make sure you had 3 or 4 courses at least. She holds out her glass for a top up and carries on.So tell me Mr Bingley. Whom did you like least of all your guests this evening?Allowing for new carriages, dresses etcetera, etcetera. We will be having a wedding here at Netherfield in less than three months, if you ask me. Mr Bennet? Mr Bennet! 5o INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - LONGBOURNE - DAY. 50 The Bennets eat in silence. Jane.yawns. Mrs Bennet moans - she is hungover. Mr Collins comes in in a state of agitation. They look at him. He sits, hesitates, thenOh! Yes. Certainly - Lizzy would be very happy indeed. Please -- go ahead. No time like the present. Everyone. Out. Mr Collins would like a private audience with your sister. Everyone looks in amazement.No. Nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you-will stay where you are. Everyone else, to the drawing room. Mr Bennet.Now! Mrs Bennet makes sure everyone leaves, winks at Mr Collins then shuts the door before Elizabeth has time to do anything. Elizabeth looks at Mr Collins who looks at her in earnest. There is a horrible pause of intense embarrassment.sshhh.Declined indeed! The headstrong, foolish- we shall have this little hiccup dealt with immediately, Mr Collins. Mrs Bennet goes chases after Elizabeth. Mr Collins watches through a window as Elizabeth is chased by her mother.Oh Mr Bennet. We are all in a uproar. You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr Collins, for she vows she will not have him.Mr Collins, Mr Collins has proposed to Lizzie. But Lizzy declares she will not have him, and now the danger is Mr Collins may not have Lizzy.Speak to Lizzy. They march to find Elizabeth.Tell her that you insist upon them marrying.You will have this house!You'll save your sisters from destitution!Go back now and say you've changed your mind!Think of your family!Mr Bennet, say something!Yes, or I shall never see her again?Oh, ungrateful child! I shall never speak to her again! Not that I have much pleasure in talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer... She jabbers on but her voice fades. We're with Jane, re- reading the letter.Give my love to my sister. And try not to be so much of a burden, dear. Jane's carriage moves away and the family wave. Mr Bennet talks to Elizabeth.Oh, if I could but go to Brighton -\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 A little sea-bathing would set me up veryI'm sure I cried for two days when Colonel Millar's regiment went away. thought I should have broke my heart.Why did the Foresters let her out of their sight? I always said they were unfit to have charge of her.You are all ruined. Who will take you now with a fallen sister? Poor Mr Bennet will now have to fight the perfidious Wickham and then be killed...- and The Collins' will turn us out before he is cold in his grave -Lydia must know what this will do to my nerves, such flutterings and spasms all over me...We are ruined. Ruined.Lydia married! And at sixteen too! Ring the bell, Kitty! I must put on my things and tell Lady Lucas! Oh to see her face! And tell the servants they will have a bowl of punch! The other Bennet's are assembled.And so he should help! He's much richer than us, and he hasn't got any children.A daughter, married!\"Mrs Wickham\" - how well it soundsNow where will they live? Purvis Lodge might do. Ashworth is vacant of course, but it's too far off, I couldn't bear to have her ten miles from me -Write to me often, my dear'. Wickham takes his leave of Elizabeth.Mr Bingley? Mrs Hill indicates a woman in the butcher's shop.Tomorrow?Huh! Come along, girls. Their mother goes into the draper's shop. Jane pauses at the threshold.Oh my goodness! Everybody act naturally. Jane completely freezes. Everybody else goes into a fluster.Whatever you do, do not appear overbearing. Kitty looks out through a window.Mr Darcy indeed! The very insolence of 0 0 it. What does he think of coming here? Elizabeth returns to her seat and sits down, heavily. Mrs Bennet hurries over to Jane and pinches her cheeks.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 (to Mary - who is stillHow very glad we are to see you, Mr Bingley! There are a great many changes since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own daughters too, you will have seen it in the papers though it was not put in as it ought to have been. Very short, nothing about her family.- but it's very hard to have my Lydia taken away from me. Mr Wickham has been transferred to Newcastle, where ever that is. Thank heaven he has some friends. Mrs Bennet shoots a frosty glance at Mr Darcy. This is more than Elizabeth can bare.When you have killed all your own birds, Mr Bingley, I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please.- Mr Bennet will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 the covies for you.My Jane looks well, does she not? Mr-Bingley stands up abruptly.You must come again. For when you were in town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us. I have not forgot you see. At least three courses. Bingley and Darcy take their leave, leaving the Bennets sitting in silence all looking at once another. Kitty is fit to burst out laughing, Elizabeth and Jane horrified by the awkward visit.Girls. Everybody to the kitchen. Immediately. Oh, Mr Bingley. It is so good to see you again so soon. She ushers everyone out, not before squeezing Jane's hand. Now Jane and Bingley are alone, facing each other with extreme embarrassment.Thank the Lord for that. I thought it would never happen.Exceed their income? He has five thousand a year! I knew she could not be so beautiful for nothing. The camera moves through to another bedroom - where Mary is reading a book out loud to Kitty - then to yet anotherAll but one, the youngest has been lately married your ladyship. And my eldest was only proposed to yesterday afternoon.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 I am sure it is nothing compared to Rosings, but it is larger than Sir William Lucas's, I can assure you.Lizzie!Lizzie, where have you been.

the evening completely in love with you then I am no judge of beauty.Oh, they are far too easy to judge.Humourless poppycocks, in my limited experience.And eat my hat. She stops speaking. And stares. A dazzling group enters the room: George Bingley, 25, a good hearted soul but \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 prone to bumbling embarrassment when his enthusiasms get the better of him, his sister Caroline, 23, a victim of every latest fashion, counting herself superior to most company she encounters, and finally, Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy, 27, dashing, brooding with an introversion which could be misconstrued as hauteur. They are dressed in the highest fashion. Darcy surveys the hall. He catches Elizabeth's eye. She stares, with a kind of surprised shock. Jane notices and looks at Darcy. He turns away.So which of the painted peacocks is our Mr Bingley?And the person with the disagreeable expression?Poor soul.How do you like it here in Hertfordshire, Mr Bingley?The library at Netherfield, I've heard, is one of the finest in the country.Do you dance Mr Darcy?Don't worry. I would not dance with him for half of Derbyshire.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Yes! I adore her.Mama!Of a fine, stout love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it is only a thin, slight sort of inclination, I'm convinced that one good sonnet will starve it away entirely. Darcy looks at Elizabeth with surprise. A glimmering of interest.Oh dancing, of course. Even if ones partner is barely tolerable. She gives him a dazzling smile. Darcy looks startled. He has no idea she heard him. He blushes.Handsome, conveniently rich -I agree entirely, only the deepest love will persuade me into matrimony, which is why I will end up an old maid.Jane, he danced with you most of the night.That is one great difference between us. Compliments always take you by surprise. Well, Mr Bingley is certainly very amiable, and I give you leave to like him. You've liked many a stupider person.You're a great deal too apt to like people in general, you know. All the world is good and agreeable in your eyes.Mr Darcy? I could more easily forgive his vanity had he not wounded mine. But no matter. I doubt we shall ever speak again. She blows out the candle.Oh Mother, please! It's ten in the morning. Mrs Hill enters the room and interrupts Mrs Bennet's \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 babbling.Though I don't think, mama, you can reasonably take credit for making it rain. Let's hope she hasn't caught her death before she gets there.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 \"And my kind friends will not hear of me returning home until I am better -- but do not be alarmed excepting a sore throat, a. fever, and a headache there is nothing wrong with me.\" This is ridiculous.Though she might well perish with the shame of having such a mother. Mr Bennet laughs.I am going to Netherfield at once.Then I will walk there. We should not leave Jane alone in her condition.I will be fit for Jane which is all I care about.I'm so sorry. How is my sister?Jane! Jane's face lights up. Elizabeth kisses her.Don't worry. I don't know who is more pleased at your being here, Mama or Mr Bingley. Bingley comes in having attended to the doctor.Thank you for tending to my sister so diligently, it seems she is in better comfort here than she would be at home.Goodness! You must comprehend a great deal in the idea.i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing any.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 I never saw such a woman. She would certainly be a fearsome thing to behold. Pause. Darcy goes back to his letter. Caroline Bingley picks up a book. Pauses. Puts it down. she walks over toAnd it's a small kind of accomplishment, I suppose. Darcy meets Lizzie's eye, briefly. He goes back to his letter-writing. More walking up and down. Caroline Bingley turns to Darcy.Our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it.We could always tease him.Are you too proud, Mr Darcy? And would you consider that a fault?For we're trying to find a fault in you.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Oh dear, I cannot tease you about that. What a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.Jane, do you think you might feel well enough to leave today?Indeed Mania, I think Mr Darcy merely meant there were not such a variety of people to be met in the country as there are in town, which you must acknowledge to be true.(trying to stop Bingley beingThank you, Mary.Mr Darcy.Please, drive on.Do these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are they the result of previous study? Jane kicks Elizabeth under the table. Elizabeth tries not to laugh at Mr Collins' answer.Believe me, no one would suspect your manners to be practised. The girls look at one another.Oh no! Mx Collins spots them and darts through a door in the garden wall and hurries towards the bridge to meet them.Quick! This way! She pulls Jane across the duck board spanning the moat, through the house and out the front. Mr Collins doubles back and follows them into the house. The girls are no-where to be seen. He looks around, puzzled.Kitty? Lydia! She and Jane join them.So you don't mind being laughed at?It is a somewhat sterile quality, is it not, to be aware of ones importance in the world.No! Please - Mr Wickham! - Wickham gives Elizabeth a smile and moves away to the counter.You're too generous.It all adds up.Will you be stationed here all winter, Mr Wickham?About a month. Are you acquainted with, Mr Darcy?As much as I could ever wish to be. I have spent four days in the same house as him, and I think him very disagreeable.I think I shall take a little air. She rises and walks through the room towards a balcony. As she passes the other tables we follow and witness snippets of their conversations.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 I hope your plans in favor of Meryton will not be affected by your difficult relations with the gentleman we were just speaking of.I must ask you Mr Wickham, what is the manner of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?How so?If it is not true let Mr Darcy contradict it himself. But until he does, I hope never to encounter him.On the contrary, he is twice the man Darcy is.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 No, no not at all. Admiring the splendor of the ball.Detained? Mr Collins arrives, breathless. He smiles eagerly at Elizabeth.Oh. I didn't think you danced, Mr Collins.That gentleman barely warrants the name. The dance leads Elizabeth back to Mr Collins.You may. Darcy walks away.What was I thinking? Have I no presence of mind?lI do love a Sarabande.It is your turn to say something, Mr Darcy - I talked about the dance, now you ought to remark on the size of the room or the number of couples.That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But for now we may be silent.We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will - amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb. So a little lubrication to avoid embarrassment might be advantageous.Very mild weather we've been having.Yes, we often walk to Meryton - it is a great opportunity to meet new people. In fact when you met us we had just had the pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship. I remember hearing you once say that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being created?To make out your character, Mr Darcy.very little. The dancefinishes.I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.His lack of trustworthiness and descent appear by your account to be the same thing,I believe so.But sir -Aren't you going to do something?Perhaps my family have made a competition to see who can expose themselves to the most ridicule.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Yes. I think he likes her very much.She is just shy and modest. If he does not perceive her regard he is a fool.Mother. I really think it is time to go.Really. This is enough. Darcy looking down at Elizabeth from a staircase. He turns and walks away.Wait. I beg you. Mr Collins can have nothing to say to me.that anybody need not hear.Mr Collins -You are too hasty, sir! You forget that I have made no answer.Sir, I am honoured by your proposal, but regret I must decline it.Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious. You could not make me happy and I'm convinced I'm the last woman in the world who could make you happy.Mr Collins -Sir! I am not the sort of female to torment a respectable man. Please understand me - I cannot accept you! Elizabeth storms out of the room and out of the house. Mrs Bennet crashes in through another door, hot on the tail of Elizabeth.Thank you, papa. Elizabeth turns around and walks into the drawing room.What's wrong, Jane? Close on Jane's pale face. She's staring at the letter.I don't understand. What would take him from Netherfield? Why would he not know when he was to return?\"Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister and we are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgina Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance and accomplishments, so much so I must hope to hereafter call her my sister. It is my duty to indulge you in no hope in this respect for your own self.\"Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and is gone with him to persuade him otherwise.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 He loves you, Jane. Do not give up. Go to our aunt and uncle's in London.Let it be known you are there and I am sure he will come to you.Thank you, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane's good fortune.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 What news?Engaged?No, no... Of course not.And that's all you expect?And we only have two choices?You can still change your mind, Charlotte.All of them?It could not be worse. I have been invited to possibly the very last place on earth I would like to go.I have not heard from Mr Wickham since the regiment left for Brighton, but I am informed by Lydia who keeps a breast of all matters military that he does very well.I am, your ladyship.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Mr Darcy! What are you doing here?Yes, madam, I had the pleasure of meeting him in Hertfordshire. Darcy's friend Fitzwilliam, a much more easy-going chap, introduces himself.Really? Miss Bingley will be disappointed to hear that. What a sickly, cross little thing! Oh yes, they should suit each other very well. Charlotte smiles back, a little fearfully. She's more intimidated by Rosings than Elizabeth is, and indeed has more at stake. 68 INT. DINING ROOM - ROSINGS - NIGHT. f 9 The dining room is laid for a very grand dinner -- footmen waiting, thousands of candles.They are, thank you.A little, ma'am, and very poorly.No, not at all.Not one.My mother would have no objection but my father hates London.We never had a governess. Mr Collins squirms in embarrassment. Darcy watches Elizabeth, keenly.Not at all, Lady Catherine.Yes, ma'am. All.Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. But I think it would be very hard on younger sisters, not to have their share of amusement because the elder is still unmarried. And to be kept back on such a motive! It would hardly encourage sisterly affection.No, I beg you -Please, I told you I play poorly -You mean to frighten me, Mr Darcy, by coming in all your state to hear me, but I won't be alarmed even though your sister does play so well.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 You really care to know? The colonel nods.Prepare yourself for something very dreadful.Maybe you should take your aunt's advice and practice. Ouch! Darcy flinches. Lizzie turns away from him and carries on playing. Darcy gazes at the curve of her neck. She plays a false note, stumbles, and grimly carries on.Please, do be seated.I believe so -- and she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more gratefulHe is indeed lucky to have found one of the few sensible women who would have accepted him. Darcy sits down.Shall I call for some tea?How long do you plan to stay in Kent, Colonel?I do imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly to have someone to order around. I wonder he does not marry and secure a lasting convenience of that kind.Really?What happened?Did Mr Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?What kind of objections? Her lack of fortune?So he separated them?I wish Mr Darcy and all his friends well in finding partners suitable to their very high standards. Good morning, Col. Fitzwilliam. Elizabeth see that Collinses are still busy with their parishioners and slips away. Darcy sees her from a distance.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Me?I don't understand...Yes, sir.No?I might as well enquire why, with so. evident a design of insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your better judgement. If I was uncivil, that was some excuse -But I have other reasons, you know I have!Do you think that anything might tempt me to accept the man who has ruined, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister? Silence. Darcy looks as if he's been struck across the face.Do you deny it, Mr Darcy? That you separated a young couple who loved each other, exposing your friend to the censure of the world for caprice, and my sister to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind?\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Indifferent?That's because she's shy!Because you suggested it!My sister hardly shows her true feelings to me! I suppose you suspect that his fortune had some bearing on the matter?What was?Did my sister give that impression?Our want of connection? Mr Bingley didn't vex himself about that!How, sir?And what about Mr Wickham?What excuse can you give for your behavior to him?He told me of his misfortunes.You have ruined his chances, and yet treat him with sarcasm?My pride?And those are the words of a gentleman? From the first moment I met you, your arrogance and conceit, your selfish distain of the feelings of others, made me realize that you were the last man in the world I could ever be prevailed upon to marry. Darcy recoils, as if slapped. A terrible silence.I was caught somewhat off-guard.No! Charlotte, I shall be quite all right. Please, give Lady de Bourgh my apologies. You must not keep her waiting. Mr Collins clatters up the stairs.I do not know. I hardly know myself. Elizabeth looks at Charlotte utterly shaken.How is Jane? Mrs Gardiner smiles sadly.oh Jane...Nothing. Everything as you might imagine. Elizabeth tries to smile. There is a crash as all the Bennet's arrive at the house. Kitty rushes into the garden crying her eyes out, she is followed by Lydia and Mrs Bennet.Kitty, what's happened?Please Papa, don't let her go!If you, dear father, will not take the trouble to check her, she will be fixed forever as the silliest and most determined flirt who ever made her family ridiculous. And Kitty will follow, as she always does.Peace! Is that all you care about?Father, its dangerous! -No wonder our family is treated with contempt. She leaves, tears stinging her eyes. Her father looks puzzled at her outburst.I don't wish to be stuck with such a foolish family any longer, with your constant talk of men and marriages. Surely there is more to life.Believe me, men are either eaten up with arrogance or stupidity. And if they're amiable they're so easily led that they have no minds of their own whatsoever.No, they bring nothing but heartache.I saw Mr Darcy when I was in Rosings.No. He did not. Elizabeth has never felt more alone in the company of her sister.I would rather stay here.If it is anything like Mr Darcy, I am sure I will not be able to bear it.I hear that Pemberley is not far from here.You see something of the owner, do you, in town?Only a little.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 They are at home?!I thought you were in London.No. Another ghastly silence. Then they both speak at once.I'm visiting Derbyshire with my uncle and aunt.Very pleasant. Tomorrow we go to Matlock.Yes. At the Rose and Crown. Another pause. She extends her hand.I'm so sorry to intrude. They said the house was open for visitors. I had no idea... She shakes his hand and starts to walk away.Oh no! I'm very fond of walking.Goodbye, Mr Darcy.His sister?What a beautiful instrument.Yes, very.It is so beautiful up here. I will be sorry to leave. Darcy smiles at her.You have been a most gracious host. I'm sure my aunt and uncle will talk of nothing else for days.It does you credit, sir.It is the most dreadful news. Lydia has run away - with Mr Wickham. They are gone together from Brighton to Lord knows where. She has no money, no connections, I fear she is lost forever.No, this is my fault. I might have prevented all of it by merely being open with my sisters rather than too proud with my knowledge. Mr and Mrs Gardiner look at each other perplexed.Father has gone to London. But I know very well that nothing can be done. We have not the smallest hope.Sir, it think it is too late.He hasn't found him yet, Mama.How long is this going to go on for?I can't bear not hearing anything.Oh father, I'm so sorry.You mustn't be too severe on yourself.Give it to me.They will be, if father will settle a hundred pounds a year on her. That is Wickham's condition.You will agree to this, father? The letter is passed around the other girls.Ah, I see.Do you think it a large sum?We should thank our uncle, Mama.Is that all you think about?I don't want to hear -Can't you understand why?Very much. We found a great deal to talk about.Please, Lydia!Everything?But why did he do it?That is the consequence of marrying a daughter. It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single.Do you hope to stay long in the country, Mr Bingley?Are you well, Mr Darcy?Well, I hope the weather stays fine, for your sport.I think you are in great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.How did he account for it?Unfathomable.Bravo! That is the most unforgiving speech you've ever made.Perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr Collins in time. What is that? More noise, it sounds like a carriage, then a loud banging on the door downstairs. The girls look at each other.Lady Catherine! Lady Catherine does not acknowledge her, but comes in uninvited, inspecting the assembled company of aghast Bennets.Indeed you are mistaken. I can not account for this honour at all.If you believed it impossible, I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.I have never heard of it.I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may ask the questions, which I may not choose to answer.Your Ladyship declared it to be impossible.Only this - if that is the case you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me.I am not.I will not. And I certainly never shall. Allow me to say, the arguments which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have, insulted me in every possible method and can now have nothing further to say. I must ask you to leave immediately. Good night. Elizabeth throws open.the door, revealing the family outside.Just a small misunderstanding. She walks past them to bed.For once in your life. Just leave me alone. Everyone looks aghast at Elizabeth's reaction.Mr Darcy!I could not sleep.Mr Darcy, I must thank you for your unexampled generosity to both my sisters. I know what kindnesses you have done for poor Lydia and suspect your hand in the happy resolution for Jane also.I am very happy to inform you that not only have my sentiments changed there are no other words which could give me greater pleasure. Darcy stares at her. They both start to cry. Darcy very, very slowly and gently touches her face. She closes her eyes. They kiss. She touches his face with her hand, the kiss becomes passionate.Mr Darcy has come to speak with Papa. Everyone is stunned.No, Papa.I do like him!No, you mustn't tell anyone! He wouldn't want it.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Very much. He looks at her earnestly, searching her face. He loves his daughter very deeply. What he sees leaves him in no doubt.Oh thank you! She starts to rush out.How did it begin?Now be sincere, did you admire me for my impertinenc?You may as well call it impertinence, though make a virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate - them as much as possible. And, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as maybe... and I shall begin directly... We draw back-their figures diminish, smaller and smaller under the immense, star-spangled sky. . .Fainter and fainter, the sound of music and laughter...", "clean_line": "\u00e2 man room end evening

It is the work of many generations.Not if I can help it. Elizabeth, Darcy and Miss Bingley stand in silence as they over hear the following...You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room.Perfectly tolerable, I dare say, but not handsome enough to tempt me. Elizabeth's smile drops.You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me. Bingley goes off.I thought that poetry was the food of love.So what do you recommend, to encourage affection?I think her concern for her sister does her credit. A little pause, Caroline recovers.It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.I have already told her once, by your desire. Lizzie looks across from her book.The word is indeed applied too liberally. I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen women, in all my acquaintance, that are truely accomplished.I do.And of course she must improve her mind by extensive reading. Elizabeth closes her book.Are you so severe on your own sex?You can only have two motives, Miss Bingley, and I would interfere with either.Either you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss, or you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage by walking. If the first, I should get in your way. If the second, I can admire you \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 much better from here.That I couldn't say.Maybe it's that I find it hard to forgive the follies and vices of others, or their offences against myself. My good opinion, once lost, is lost forever.I find it perfectly adequate even if society is a little less varied than in town.Miss Bennet. They share a look as Elizabeth joins the rest of the Bennets in the carriage. The driver takes off. Bingley waves enthusiastically to Jane.May I have the next dance, Miss Elizabeth. Elizabeth is stunned.Indeed. Most invigorating. They continue, for a moment, in silence.I am perfectly happy to oblige, please advise me of what you would like most to \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 hear.Do you talk as a rule while dancing?I see no striking resemblance of your own character in this, how near it is to mine I cannot say. Tell me do you and your sisters very often walk to Meryton?I will admit your Mr Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends - whether he is capable of retaining them is less certain.I am. May I ask to what these questions tend.And what have you discovered?I hope to afford you more clarity in the \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 future.She plays very well.I am well enough acquainted with you, Miss Bennet, to know I cannot alarm you even should I wish it. A beat. They eye each other warily. Colonel Fitzwilliam joins them.I do not have the talent of conversing easily with people I have never met before.This is a charming house. I believe my aunt did a great deal to it when Mr Collins first arrived.Mr Collins seems very fortunate in his choice of wife.No. Thankyou. The sound of the front door, and voices. Darcy jumps up.Good day, Miss Bennet. It's been a pleasure. He bows to her and leaves. Elizabeth sits there, bemused and intrigued.Miss Bennet, I have struggled in vain but I can bear it no longer ... . The past months have been a torment... He pauses, unable to speak. Elizabeth stares at him in astonishment. He struggles on.I came to Rosings with the single object of seeing you...I had to see you...\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 I've fought against my better judgement, my family's expectation...Please do me the honour of accepting my hand. A silence. Elizabeth struggles with the most painful confusion of feeling. Finally she recovers.Are you laughing at me?Are you rejecting me?Might I ask why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus repulsed?Believe me, I didn't mean -What reasons?I do not deny it.Because I believed your sister indifferent to him.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 I watched them most carefully, and realized his attachment was much deeper than hers.Bingley too is modest, and was persuaded that she didn't feel strongly for him.I did it for his own good.It was made perfectly clear that-an advantageous marriage...There was, however, I have to admit... the matter of your family -No, it was more than that.It pains me to say this, but it was the lack of propriety shown by your mother, your three younger sisters - even, on occasion, your father. Forgive me. Lizzie blushes. He has hit home. Darcy paces up and down.You and your sister -- I must exclude from this... Darcy stops and gazes at her. He is in turmoil. Elizabeth glares at him, in a blaze of fury and misery.Mr Wickham?You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns!Oh yes, his misfortunes have been very great indeed!So this is your opinion of me! Thank you for explaining so fully. Perhaps these offences might have been overlooked, if your pride had not been hurt -- by my honesty in admitting scruples about our relationship.Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your circumstances?Forgive me, madam, for taking up so much of your time. He leaves, abruptly. Elizabeth watches him stride away, through the rain. What has she done? She bitterly bursts into tears.I came to leave you this. He places a letter on the table behind her. Elizabeth does not turn but watches him through the mirror.I'm not going to renew the sentiments which were so disgusting to you, but to address the two offenses you have laid against me. I had not long been in Hertfordshire before I saw that BingleyYet when I observed your sister .1 detected no symptom of peculiar regard, and witnessed only the families coarse appetite for having their daughters married favorably. And so in London, perhaps erroneously, I persuaded him of the unfitness of the match citing your sisters coolness towards him. We zoom in on Elizabeth's reflection.It was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you appear naturally insufficient, they were done to protect a friend. As to the other \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 more serious matter..\"My father provided for Mr Wickham a valuable living. Elizabeth tears open the envelope, her hands shaking, and reads the letter, as Darcy's voice carries on.\"But upon his death, however, Mr Wickham told me that he had no intention of taking orders and would I recompense him to the tune of \u00c2\u00a33000 so he could go to town and study the law. We circle Elizabeth as she reads.\"But last summer he was unwillingly obtruded on my notice when he connived a relationship with my sister whom he persuaded to be in love with him and made her consent to an elopement. She was but fifteen.Mr Wickham's prime objective was her inheritance of thirty thousand pounds but hope of revenging me was a strong inducement. I was lucky enough to persuade my sister of her folly. I hope this goes someway to mitigating my behaviour in your eyes. If you doubt my word please have it confirmed by myP.S. As we shall never meet again, I wish you all happiness in the future. Elizabeth looks out at the high warehouse building and the bustle of trade. There is no horizon. is 79 INT. GARDINERS HOUSE - CHEAPSIDE - DAY. 7 Mrs Gardiner, the girls' kindly aunt, is taking Elizabeth's coat from her.Miss Bennet! Elizabeth stops, appallingly embarrassed. Darcy catches up with her. They both blush, deeply.And are you having a pleasant trip?\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Tomorrow?May I see you to the village?Yes.- I shall send my carriage at noon After a moment Darcy leaves and Elizabeth approaches the table.My sister, Miss Darcy... They smile and bob. Georgiana is a friendly, sweet girl.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Yes I should.She's easily persuaded, is she not? They gaze at each other with affection. Miss Bingley approaches.Your uncle is fond of fishing, I hear.Can you persuade him to borrow a rod this afternoon?For the lake here is very well stocked and its occupants left in peace for far \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 too long. Elizabeth smiles, surprised and delighted. And grateful to be rescued. What does Mr Darcy mean by this? She moves away, to speak to her uncle. Miss Bingley moves closer to Darcy.I perceive no alteration' except she is rather tanned. Hardly a miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.You must have mis-heard, Caroline. Even had I thought it, I would have couched itMiss Elizabeth. She cries on.Miss Elizabeth. She eventually gathers herself.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 This is my fault - if only I had exposed Wickham when I should.Would to heaven that anything could be said or done on my part that could offer consolation to such distress.I am so very sorry. This is grave indeed. I will leave you. Goodbye. Darcy pauses at the door, looks back at Elizabeth and then is gone.I have some business with Mr Bingley. Darcy goes inside and the door shuts. The camera cranes slowly upstairs until we can see through the first floor window and into the drawing room. Mr Darcy enters and bows to Mr Bingley. He starts to talk in earnest. Bingley looks stunned by what Darcy is relaying to him. We witness the dumbshow of Darcy confessing that he has wronged Jane Bennet.Quite well, thank you.I return to town tomorrow.What were you thinking of? It's as if Bingley has not heard. He keeps pacing up and down.What are you doing out here so early?Me neither. I have been up.most of the night.I am alarmed that you know of what I have been so in earnest to keep silent. But you must know that your happiness was one of my prime inducements. Elizabeth looks at Darcy.I know you are too generous to trifle with me. I believe you spoke with my Aunt last night, and it has taught me to hope as I had scarcely allowed myself before. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged, butIf, however, your feelings have changed... Elizabeth gazes at him.I would have to tell you, you have bewitched me body and soul and I love and love and love you. And never wish to be parted from you from this day on. Elizabeth looks at him. She does not say a word. Darcy is staring at her for a reply. A tear rolls down Elizabeth's cheek.Allow me, Mrs Darcy. He puts out his hand. She takes it. He helps her up the rocks. When they get to the top they sit there, side by side, and gaze at the distant lights of Pemberley.I cannot fix the hour, or the spot, orFor the liveliness of your mind, I did.", "clean_line": "thank
