You will learn.There's a hole in the world Like a great black pit And the vermin of the world Inhabit it And its morals aren't worth What a pig could spit And it goes by the name Of London. At the top of the hole Sit the privileged few Making mock of the vermin In the lower zoo, Turning beauty into filth and greed. I too Have sailed the world, and seen its wonders For the cruelty of men Is as wondrous as Peru, But there's no place like London!I beg your indulgence, Anthony ... My mind is far from easy. In these once familiar streets I feel shadows everywhere...Ghosts.There was a barber and his wife, And she was beautiful, A foolish barber and his wife, She was his reason and his life, And she was beautiful, And she was virtuous. And he was... Naive.There was another man who saw That she was beautiful, A pious vulture of the law, Who with a gesture of his claw Removed the barber from his plate. Then there was nothing but to wait And she would fall, So soft, So young, So lost, And oh, so beautiful!Oh, that was many years ago... I doubt if anyone would know.I owe you my life, Anthony. If you hadn't spotted me, I would be lost on the ocean still ... Thank you.You might find me, if you like, around Fleet Street.There's a hole in the world Like a great black pit And it's filled with people Who are filled with shit And the vermin of the world Inhabit it...Isn't that a room over the shop? If times are so hard, why don't you rent it out?Haunted?Transported? What was his crime?NOOOOOOOO...!..... NOOOOOO!Would no one have mercy on her?Where's Lucy?! Where's my wife?!He? Judge Turpin?Fifteen years of sweating in a living hell on a false charge. Fifteen years dreaming that I might come home to find a loving wife and child...No, not Barker. That man is dead. It's Todd now. Sweeney Todd ... And he will have his revenge.Judge Turpin and the Beadle will pay for what they did.First I must have my shop back.I don't believe it...Silver, yes...You there, my friend, Come, let me hold you.--My lucky friends. Till now your shine Was merely silver. Friends, You shall drip rubies, You'll soon drip precious Rubies...Leave me now...At last my arm is complete again.He's here every Thursday?Not for long.By tomorrow they'll all be flocking to me like sheep to be shorn--I will do what I have vowed to do ... ... Come closer, my friend, closer...Pardon me, ma'am, what's that awful stench?Must be standing near an open trench!What is this?Smells like piss.This is piss. Piss with ink.Keep it off your boots, sir-- Eats right through.I do. I am Mr. Sweeney Todd of Fleet Street. I have opened a bottle of Pirelli's elixir, and I say to you that it is nothing but an arrant fraud, concocted from piss and ink.And furthermore -- \"signor\" -- I have serviced no kings, yet I wager I can shave a cheek with ten times more dexterity that any street mountebank.You see these razors?I lay them against five pounds you are no match for me. You hear me, sir? Either accept my challenge or reveal yourself as a sham.Friends, who's for a free shave?Will Beadle Bamford be the judge?Ready.The five pounds. Pirelli produces a distinctive chatelaine purse and removes a five pound note, gives it to Todd:I thank you for your honest adjudication, sir. You are a paragon of integrity.Yes, sir.You will be welcome, Beadle Bamford, and I guarantee to give you, without a penny's charge, the closest shave you will ever know. PAGE 35.Of course.Why doesn't the Beadle come? \"Before the week is out,\" that's what he said.And the Judge? When will we get to him?Slow down, Anthony.The girl may come.For a few hours? Before he carries her off to the other end of England?What's this?Go -- keep the boy below with you.Signor Pirelli.Why?Signor Pirelli has been called away. You better run after him.So, hmmm, Mrs. Lovett gave you a pie, did she?That she is ... that she is. But if I know a growing boy, there's still room for some more pie, eh?Then why don't you run downstairs and wait for your master there? There'll be another pie in it for you, I'm sure...I know -- why don't you tell Mrs. Lovett I said to give you a nice big tot of gin?He won't be back.He recognized me from the old days. He tried to blackmail me -- half my earnings.Send him up.Send him up, woman.Anything you say.The Judge.Justice ... Justice.At your service ... An honor to receive your patronage, my lord.Who in this wide world is not familiar with the honored Judge Turpin?That is gracious of him, sir ... ... Sit, if you please, sir.

His throat was bare Beneath my hand--!No, I had him! His throat was there, And he'll never come again!When?!Why did I wait? You told me to wait! Now he'll never come again...There's a hole in the world Like a great black pit And it's filled with people Who are filled with shit And the vermin of the world Inhabit it-- But not for long!They all deserve to die! Tell you why, Mrs. Lovett, Tell you why: Because in all of the whole human race, Mrs. Lovett There are two kinds of men and only two. There's the one staying put In his proper placeNo, we all deserve to die! Even you, Mrs. Lovett, Even I. Because the lives of the wicked should be-- Made brief.

Not one man, no, Nor ten men, Nor a hundred Can assuage me-- I will have you!And I will get him back Even as he gloats. In the meantime I'll practice On less honorable throats--And my Lucy lies in ashes And I'll never see my girl again, But the work waits, I'm alive at lastLater on, when it's dark, we'll take him to some secret place and bury him.Shame?Ah!Mrs. Lovett, What a charming notion,Eminently practical and yet Appropriate as always. Mrs. Lovett, how I've lived without you All these years I'll never know! How delectable! Also undetectable.For what's the sound of the world out there?Those crunching noises pervading the air?It's man devouring man, my dear,And who are we To deny it in here?Ah, these are desperate times, Mrs. Lovett, and desperate measures are called for.What is that?Is it really good?Awful lot of fat.Haven't you got poet Or something like that?Mmm.

More like vicar.The history of the world, my love----Is those below serving those up above.How gratifying for once to know--Too salty. I prefer general.What is that?Put it on a bun. Well, you never know if it's going to run.No, the clergy is really Too coarse and too mealy.Yes, and always arrives overdone. I'll come again when you Have Judge on the menu...What's that?Have charity towards the world, my pet--We'll take the customers that we can get.We'll not discriminate great from small. No, we'll serve anyone--Johanna...Johanna...And if you're beautiful, what then, With yellow hair, like wheat? I think we shall not meet again-- My little dove, my sweet...

The way I've dreamed you are. Oh look, Johanna-, A star! A shooting star!And though I'll think of you, I guess, Until the day I die, I think I miss you less and less As every day goes by...Johanna...And you'd be beautiful and pale, And look too much like her. If only angels could prevail, We'd be the way we were. Johanna...Wake up, Johanna! Another bright red day! We learn, Johanna, To say...

I have no time, woman! Come on--!Of course ...

All I meant is that I Haven't seen a customer for weeks. Did you come here for a pie, sir? Do forgive me if me head's a little vague-- Ugh! What is that? But you'd think we had the plague-- From the way that people-- Keep avoiding-- No, you don't! Heaven knows I try, sir! Tsk! But there's no one comes in even to inhale--And no wonder with the price of meat What it is-- When you get it. Never Thought I'd live to see the day Men'd think it was a treat Finding poor Animals Wot are dying in the street. Mrs. Mooney has a pie shop, Does a business, but I noticed something weird-- Lately all her neighbors' cats have disappeared. Have to hand it to her-- Wot I calls Enterprise, Popping pussies into pies. Wouldn't do in my shop-- Just the thought of it's enough to make you sick.Trust me, dearie, it's going to take more than ale to wash that taste out. Come with me and we'll get you a nice tumbler of gin.Isn't this homey now? Me cheery wallpaper was a real bargain too, it being only partly singed when the chapel burnt down ....There's a good boy, now you sit down and warm your bones, you look chilled through.Up there? Oh, no one will go near it...People think it's haunted.And who's to say they're wrong? ... You see, years ago, something happened up there. Something not very nice... The flickering flame from the fire begins to cast a more intense red glow on her face...There was a barber and his wife, And he was beautiful, A proper artist with a knife, But they transported him for life. And he was beautiful...Barker, his name was -- Benjamin Barker.Foolishness.He had this wife, you see, Pretty little thing, Silly little nit Had her chance for the moon on a string-- Poor thing. Poor thing.There was this Judge, you see, Wanted her like mad, Every day he'd send her a flower, But did she come down from her tower? Sat up there and sobbed by the hour, Poor fool.Ah, but there was worse yet to come, Poor thing. PAGE 14.The Beadle calls on her, all polite, Poor thing, poor thing. The Judge, he tells her, is all contrite, He blames himself for her dreadful plight She must come straight to his house tonight! Poor thing, poor thing.Of course, when she goes there, Poor thing, poor thing, They're having this ball all in masks.There's no one she knows there, Poor dear, poor thing, She wanders tormented, and drinks, Poor thing. The Judge has repented, she thinks, Poor thing. \"Oh, where is Judge Turpin?\" she asks.He was there, all right-- Only not so contrite! She wasn't no match for such craft, you see,So it is you -- Benjamin Barker.She poisoned herself. Arsenic from the apothecary on the corner. I tried to stop her but she wouldn't listen to me. And he's got your daughter.Adopted her like his own.Well, I can't say the years have been particularly kind to you, Mr. Barker, but you still--Come along...Not to worry, a touch of oil will put that right. ... Nothing to be afraid of, love, come in.When they came for the girl, I hid 'em. I thought, who knows? Maybe the silly blighter'll be back again. Cracked in the head, wasn't I?Those handles is chased silver, ain't they?I'm your friend too, Mr. Todd. If you only knew, Mr. Todd-- Ooh, Mr. Todd, You're warm In my hand. You've come home. Always had a fondness for you, I did.Never you fear, Mr. Todd, You can move in here, Mr. Todd. Splendors you never have dreamed All your days Will be yours. I'm your friend.Like clockwork. Eyetalian. All the rage he is.Oh Mr. T., do you really think you can do it?Come along now, dear, he might recognize you--Are we standing near an open trench?What is this?Smells like -- phew!Flies do too!The finest in England.Bravo, bravo.Smooth as a baby's arse! -- - - Well done, dear!He certainly does. Sweeney Todd's Tonsorial Parlor -- above my meatpie emporium in Fleet Street.... Like to give me a coronary right there! What if he had recognized you! Lord, my heart was beating a mile a minute, just like a little finch it was. Aren't those lovely birds now? Always so twittery and happy...... Suppose it's just me gentle heart, but I do hate to see a boy treated like that, no better than your Aunt Doreen's dog -- Mr. Todd, are you listening to me?... It's not much of a chair, I'll grant, but it'll serve. Was me poor Albert's chair. Sat in it all day long he did, after his leg give out from the gout, poor dear.And who says the week's out? It's only Tuesday.Easy now. Hush, love, hush. Don't distress yourself, What's your rush? Keep your thoughts Nice and lush. Wait. Hush, love, hush. Think it through. Once it bubbles, Then what's to do? Watch it close. Let it brew. Wait.I've been thinking, flowers-- Maybe daisies-- To brighten up the room. Don't you think some flowers, Pretty daisies, Might relieve the gloom? Ah, wait, love, wait.Can't you think of nothing else? Always broodin' away on yer wrongs what happened heaven knows how many years ago...Gillyflowers, maybe, `Stead of daisies... I don't know, though... What do you think?Mrs. Lovett, sir.Oh, this is all terribly romantic.Bring her here, dear.Seems like the fates are favoring you at last, Mr. T. What is it, love? You'll have her back before the day is out.Oh, him? Let him bring her here and then, since you're so hot for a little -- that's the throat to slit, dear.Poor little Johanna. All those years without a scrap of motherly affection. Well, we'll soon see to that...Look at that face, he's up to mischief.Plying his trade upstairs, don'tcher know ... PAGE 42. MRS. LOVETT ... Would you look at it, now! Don't look like it's had a kind word since half past never!You wouldn't mind if I gave him a nice juicy meat pie, would yer?Come with me now. Your teeth is strong, I hope?That's my boy, tuck in.Like to see a man with a healthy appetite. Reminds me of my dear Albert, like to gorge himself to bloatation, he did. He didn't have your nice full head though--My my my, always work to be done. Spic- and-span, that's my motto. Cleanliness is next to whatever-it-is. So, ah, how did you end up with that dreadful Eyetalian?Wait--!You ought to slow down a bit, lad. It'll go to your head.That's nice, dear ... I think I'll just pop in on Mr. Todd for a tick. You'll be all right here?Gawd, the lad is drinking me out of house and home, how long until Pirelli gets back?Mr. T., you didn't!You're barking mad! Killing a man wot done you no harm!Oh well, that's a different matter! For a moment there I thought you'd lost your marbles!Ooooh! All that blood! Enough to make you come all over gooseflesh, ain't it? Poor bugger. Oh, well.Three quid! Well, waste not, want not, I always say... ... Now what are we going to do about the boy?Oh, we don't need to worry about him, he's a simple thing. I'll pawn him off with some story.Now, Mr. T., surely one's enough for today. Don't want to indulge yourself, after all ... ... 'Sides, I was thinking about hiring a lad to help around the shop, me poor knees not being what they used to be.'Course we'll have to stock up on the gin, the boy drinks like a Barbary sailor--All this shouting and running about, what's happened--?The sailor busted in, I know, I saw them both running down the street and I said--There, there, dear. Don't fret--Easy now. Hush, love, hush. I keep telling you--What's your rush?That's all very well, but what are we going to do about -- -- the dear departed?Listen! Do you hear me? Get a hold of yourself!Oh, you great useless thing, come on--Sit down.There, drink it down -- all the way -- that's right ... ... Now, we got a body molderin' away upstairs, what do you intend we should do about that?Well, yes, of course, we could do that. I don't suppose he's got any relatives going to come poking around looking for him...Well, you know me, sometimes bright ideas just pop right into my head, and I keep thinking... Seems a downright shame...Seems an awful waste... Such a nice plump frame Wot's-his-name Has... Had... Has... Nor it can't be traced. Business needs a lift-- Debts to be erased-- Think of it as thrift,Good, you got it. Take, for instance, Mrs. Mooney and her pie shop. Business never better, using only Pussycats and toast. And a pussy's good for maybe six or Seven at the most. And I'm sure they can't compare As far as taste--Well, it does seem a Waste... It's an idea... Think about it... Lots of other gentlemen'll Soon be coming for a shave,What, Mr. Todd, What, Mr. Todd, What is that sound?Yes, Mr. Todd, Yes, Mr. Todd, Yes, all around--Then who are we To deny it in here? Music continues under:Here we are now, hot out of the oven...It's priest. Have a little priest.Sir, it's too good, At least. Then again, they don't commit sins of the flesh, So it's pretty fresh.Only where it sat.No, you see the trouble with poet Is, how do you know it's Deceased? Try the priest.Not as hearty as bishop, perhaps, but not as bland as curate, either.Lawyer's rather nice.Order something else, though, to follow, Since no one should swallow It twice.Well, then, if you're British and loyal, You might enjoy Royal Marine. Anyway, it's clean. Though, of course, it tastes of wherever it's been.Mercy no, sir, Look closer, You'll notice it's grocer.No, it has to be grocer -- it's green.Save a lot of graves, Do a lot of relatives favors...Everybody shaves, So there should be plenty of flavors...Since marine doesn't appeal to you, how about rear admiral?With or without his privates? -- \"With\" is extra.It's fop. Finest in the shop. Or we have some shepherd's pie peppered With actual shepherd On top. And I've just begun. Here's a politician -- so oily It's served with a doily-- Have one?Try the friar. Fried, it's drier.Then actor-- That's compacter.True, we don't have Judge -- yet -- but would you settle for the next best thing?Executioner.Yes, yes, I know, my love--High-born and low, my love.We'll serve anyone--Toby!Ale there!Quick, now!Nice to see you, dearie... How have you been keeping?... Cor, me bones is weary! Toby--! One for the gentleman... Hear the birdies cheeping-- Helps to keep it cheery...Toby! Throw the old woman out!What's your pleasure, dearie?... No, we don't cut slices... Cor, me eyes are bleary!... Toby! None for the gentleman!... I could up me prices-- I'm a little leery... Business Couldn't be better, though--Knock on wood.What's your pleasure, dearie? Oops! I beg your pardon! Just me hands is smeary-- Toby! Run for the gentleman!Don't you love a garden? Always makes me teary... Must be one them foreigners--What's my secret? Frankly, dear -- forgive my candor-- Family secret, All to do with herbs. Things like being Careful with your coriander, That's what makes the gravy grander--!Incidentally, dearie, You know Mrs. Mooney. Sales've been so dreary-- Toby! --Poor thing is penniless. What about that loony? Lookin' sort of beery-- Oh, well, got her comeuppance-- And that'll be thruppence -- andSo she should.Hold it--Bless my eyes--!Fresh supplies!How about it, dearie? Be here in a twinkling! Just confirms me theory-- Toby--! God watches over us. Didn't have an inkling... Positively eerie...Toby! Throw the old woman out!... which is not to say we couldn't get some nice taxidermy animals to bring a touch of gentility to the place. You know, a boar's head or two... Mr. T., are you listening to me?Then what did I just say?The bloody old Judge! Always harping on the bloody old Judge! We got a nice respectable business now, money coming in regular and -- since we're careful to pick and choose -- only strangers and such like wot won't be missed -- who's going to catch on?Oooh, Mr. Todd-- I'm so happy-- I could-- Eat you up, I really could! You know what I'd like to Do, Mr. Todd? What I dream-- If the business stays as good, Where I'd really like to go-- In a year or so... Don't you want to know?Do you really want to know?I've always had this dream of living at the seaside ... I got a picture postcard from me Aunt Nettie once. Oh, it seems like such a grand place... And all that fresh aquatic air's bound to be good for the lad's poxy lungs...Wouldn't that be smashing?With the sea at our gate, We'll have kippered herring Wot have swum to us straight From the Straits of Bering. Every night in the kip When we're through our kippers, I'll be there slippin' off your slippers By the sea... With the fishies splashing. By the sea... Wouldn't that be smashing? Down by the sea--I can see us waking, The breakers breaking, The seagulls squawking: Hoo! Hoo! I do me baking, Then I go walking With yoo-hoo... Yoo-hoo...I'll warm me bones On the esplanade Have tea and scones With me gay young blade...Then I'll knit a sweater While you write a letter...Unless we got better To do-hoo...Think how snug it'll be Underneath our flannel When it's just you and me And the English Channel...In our cozy retreat, Kept all neat and tidy, We'll have chums over every Friday...By the sea...Don't you love the weather By the sea? We'll grow old together By the seaside, Hoo! Hoo! By the beautiful sea!It'll be so quiet That who'll come by it Except a seagull? Hoo! Hoo! We shouldn't try it,But a seaside wedding Could be devised, Me rumpled bedding Legitimized.My eyelids'll flutter, I'll turn into butter, The moment I mutter \"I do-hoo!\"By the sea, in our nest, We could share our kippers With the odd paying guest From the weekend trippers, Have a nice sunny suite For the guest to rest in--Now and then, you could do the guest in--By the sea.

Can't really remember can you?You've got to leave all this behind you now. She's gone ... You keep looking down into the grave, you're never gonna look up. And life will just pass right by ... Life is for the alive, my dear.We could have a life we two ... Maybe not like I dreamed, maybe not like you remember ...

Here, you just sit next to me nice and quiet ... ... How could you think such a thing of Mr. Todd, who's been so good to us?Nothing's gonna harm you, Not while I'm around. Nothing's gonna harm you, darling, Not while I'm around. Demons'll charm you With a smile For a while, But in time Nothing's gonna harm you, Not while I'm around.Funny we should be having this little chat right now ... 'Cause I was just thinkin', you know how you've always fancied coming into the bakehouse with me to help make the pies?Well ... no time like the present.Well, that'll be your job now.Those grates go right down to the sewers and the whiffs come up, always a few rats gone home to Jesus down there.Now this would be the bake oven ...

Don't touch her!I was only thinking of you!Your Lucy! A crazy hag picking bones and rotten spuds out of alley ashcans! Would you have wanted to know she ended up like that?No, no, not lied at all. No, I never lied.Said she took the poison -- she did -- Never said that she died -- Poor thing, She lived--But it left her weak in the head, All she did for months was just lie there in bed--Should've been in hospital, Wound up in Bedlam instead, Poor thing!Better you should think she was dead. Yes, I lied 'cos I love you!I'd be twice the wife she was! I love you! Could that thing have cared for you Like me?Do you mean it? Everything I did I swear I thought Was only for the best, Believe me!
