If you were smart you would stop talking right now.How can you say that??Erit, you are so full of shit.Because she's a bitch! -- --Not because she's a woman.That has nothing to do with it!You'd rather \"work under\" John?No, why would I have a problem with your little sexual innuendo?So, I shouldn't take offense that you're coming on to my husband right in front of me.How? You couldn't possibly show him more of your tits.DON'T try and agree with me now.Shut up.We went to her office party, idiot.You are completely delusional. She wasn't even hitting on you in there; I just don't like her.You are such an asshole.Hello!Did he cry?Squeeze in tight.Smile. It's just until he's eighteen.Present.You hate brushing your teeth; this one brushes them in thirty seconds.When's your last class?After yesterday I probably don't have a job anyway. Do you think it was wrong to call her a useless cow?Did you call your father?\"When?\" Yesterday, for his birthday!You're completely impossible.Ever think that someone has to be the bigger person here?How are you going to feel if Luke grows up and doesn't call you?I give up.WHAT?!She's dead?? Elizabeth is dead??Hi honey. Can Mommy get a kiss? Come on, give Mommy a kiss.Is Daddy reading you my letters?What are you building? A fort?Was he scared going to school?What did you make him for lunch?Look at his friends. And his desk. This is his teacher?You may have to move to another school district.How was your first day?When is she coming?It's only been a couple of years, I'm sure she'll get around to it. Have you heard anything?--Don't--I saw that woman. She was there. She couldn't have just disappeared.Her coat snagged my purse, I felt a button pop - they must have been blind not to find it.Great, because I haven't quite bankrupted us yet.You just lie and lie. But you are very handsome. Can you do me a favor?I need you to run for governor.You can change this rule about no conjugal visits, because I don't think I can last another twenty years.I'm okay. I'm okay.You think he'll ever want to kiss me again?I'm fine. I'm fine.Hi, sweet potato. How are you doing?Yeah, I forgot. It's no big deal.I forgot, okay? I have things on my mind.Oh, that's nice.Can I please just watch him play? Tell me about kindergarten.Fine, I won't forget again, okay? I am just never going to walk him to school or wash his clothes or make him dinner...and I don't know how I can live knowing that. Okay?What? What is going to happen? There are no more appeals, there are no more anything. Exactly what miracle are we hoping for, John?I need you to do something for me.Stop bringing him.He hates coming here. Look at him.Please. It's not his fault. It's too hard to watch him forget me.You want to hear something funny?My mother tried to send me anti-aging cream.Your poor face. How could you do that to yourself?I think it's very sexy.You have nothing to apologize for. But you should have told me before this.I don't want you not telling me things.I won't know where to picture you. I close my eyes and I see Luke in his bedroom, you on the sofa by the Window. I won't know where to picture you anymore.I was only here through the appeal. We knew I'd be moved to a prison.What's wrong?Is it Luke?You haven't? YOU haven't? God, John, you are too much. Luke is having a 'hard time' because mommy is in jail for murder, not because daddy doesn't spend enough time with him! Your father was right, you don't live in the same world we do.I don't know, but it's not the real one. I am in here for the rest of my life! And you want me to believe in some fantasy that -- !Now you come here all long-faced, like you've let me down. What do you want me to do, make you feel better?And now you're apologizing. You really are a gem.Nothing. You're too perfect already. You know you never even asked me if I did it. If I killed her.Then you'd be wrong.I grabbed the fire extinguisher. I hit her in the face. I heard her neck snap. You know why I did it? Because she pissed me off. I threw her purse in the river. We paid for dinner with the cash from her wallet.I'm sorry. I'm actually very sorry.John??What are you doing here?You have to stop this.No. Stop.WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?!No.No!...Where is he?How can you do this to me?John --You son of a bitch.Where's Luke?! Is he safe? Where is he?!Oh please oh please oh please...Why didn't you tell me?What's wrong?Where's Luke?What party? You said the party was here.She?You took the wrong turn! It's back there.The zoo is back there. You're going the wrong way! It's back there! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!!What??Are you out of your mind!Hi.Did you have a nice time at the party?What was your favorite thing?They had ice cream cake here?Oh. What flavor?My favorite.I'm going to sit back here, okay?Really?Good. Then I'll stick close to you.John?

I don't even believe she is in the dental profession.I bet she can't even spell anesthesiologist. Woman's a complete fraud.I think she hit on me that night, too.I understand. People who look like that should not be allowed anywhere near oral surgery.You're in the chair trying to stay calm; how are you supposed to do that with those things hanging over your--Someone's going to --Thanks. See you next weekend.Okay, your turn.Very good, very good...No, no, no; you feed me. Your son is hopeless.You can't do this every morning. It is way too corny.Sweetie, you have to stop believing everything you read in a catalogue.I love brushing my teeth. The lies your mother tells.Three, and I have papers to grade. Can you pick up Luke?Bosses admire that kind of frank exchange.When?I sent him flowers and a handmade card.Did you notice what I got for my birthday this year? A grunt.Mom said Happy Birthday and my father went . Made me tear up.Remember this for the custody hearing: how Mommy is always scolding Daddy.Now she's driving a wedge between us.And now she is abandoning you.Get your --She didn't do anything!She didn't do anything!It's okay. Just a bad dream.You okay?Okay, you can sleep here as long as you stay on this side of the bed.You're such a snake, I don't know why I keep falling for the same trick.But Sam's your friend, right?Does he take your food?Did he say something mean? About Mommy?Did you hit him?Good. Where did you hit him?Wow. I bet that hurt.It's a toy!Don't worry. We'll get it back.Rat-Bag. Give Mommy a kiss.Every night at bedtime.I walked him to class, gave him a kiss; he didn't even look back to wave.Turkey sandwich, just butter and bread, no \"vegetables\" on it. He swore he ate his apple.Miss Phillips.Already spoke to a realtor.Excellent. Over half my class stayed awake. Talked to your mom.She's having a lot of trouble with her business.About the appeal? Yes, and I'm just not telling you. What did Meyer say?-- It can take months for the court to rule.Meyer's looking for a new investigator.He'll go through all the evidence again.We're doing fine.I don't know, I'm a little busy.-- Oh, that I can do.I know. But it's going to be fine. I promise.Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.Good?She's doing okay.I will.Ok. Thanks.Luke! Let's go, Toad. Come on.I figured you had to eat.But what if we find the woman who was leaving the parking lot?It was a robbery! Someone stole her purse!So, that's it. Now we just have the Supreme Court.So, I need to find an indecent one?Anything.I've seen the evidence, Meyer.We went out for dinner! How do you do that after you kill somebody? She would have to be a psychopath!Everyone fights with their boss!So, you never believed she was innocent?So, what are you saying, Meyer?!I'll find someone to file the pleadings.Thanks.Lara Brennan; my wife. She was sent up here. Brennan. B-R-That's ridiculous; I have to see her.Lara!Lara!My wife attempted suicide.I have to see her!Please. Two minutes.Don't worry about it.I insist. I kept you out on a school night.And give a big hug to Pengui, Little Pengui, Big Turtley, Little Turtley, Kiki and Opossumy. Lots and lots of love, Mommy. You gonna give them hugs from her? Should we write her back?Soon honey. Soon.Can you have a quarter?Ohhh. Sure, but you can't spend those. They come from the cottage where Mommy and I used to take you when you were a baby....Sure.So, what is it about? Julie?No. I mean, yes, that's in there. But what is it about?It is about how rational thought destroys the soul. It is about the triumph of irrationality, and the power that is in it.It's a course that investigates what drives men to be free, no matter the cost.You escaped from jail seven times.Mind if I tape you?How you escaped when no one else could.How do you do that?How the hell do you know that?The city....Pittsburgh.How can they be so exact?What if you can't make it out?Thirty-five minutes isn't a lot of time.How much?How did you get caught?Yeah.Oh, sorry.

How much?Give me two minutes.It was stupid, I fell off the bike.Some guy made a crack about Lara.What's that supposed to mean?Really? So, what do you believe, Mom?Come on, buddy! Where is his bag?No reason. I just stupidly thought people who loved her would actually believe she's innocent. My mistake.Give Grandma a kiss.A little.No.What?Three passports, a driver's license and social security number that can take a credit check.That's too much.Not here. Don't come here again.Show me how to load it.No video game.I'll play checkers with you after dinner.Not tonight. Tonight, I utterly destroy you.I'll just be a moment.I am useless without you. I can't even ride a bike.I'm sorry we had to do this.I know.From now on I will.Hi.I hope it's nothing serious.Hi. It's John. Luke isn't feeling well, I'm going to take him home.

You want to tell me what's going on?Yes.Sorry.You hungry? You want your sandwich?I remember.I remember your daughter.He has his father's memory.I'm afraid she can't be there. ...It's complicated.Oh, we're pretty...you know....That's true.

She really misses...all this.No. She's not like that. She'd... She's in prison.I don't tell most people.She's innocent. She didn't kill the woman.We should really be getting home.Thanks for the invitation. We'll try and make it.You want to read a letter from Mom?Dearest Luke Who I Love, But Not As Much As Chocolate...My mistake. Dearest Luke, who I love so, so much. I wish I could have walked you home today, it was so beautiful out.She's not feeling well.Because sometimes people get so sick you have to go to the hospital to get fixed.The doctors do tests.Come on.You okay?Luke!

I need it tomorrow!How much can they give me?!Are you --?I am so sorry --No, it was a long shot. Thanks.She's okay. Thanks, Meyer.Nothing.No. He's fine. I had Meyer see what he could do about not getting you moved.I told him traveling that distance would be a hardship on us, that Luke was already having trouble at school. Which is true. I haven't been spending enough time with him.That's nice, that the two of you talk. What world do I live in, Lara?Yes. Sorry.Got it. I'm sorry.What do you want from me?Because I knew you didn't.Shut up. I don't care what you say or how you say it. I don't believe you did it and I never will.
