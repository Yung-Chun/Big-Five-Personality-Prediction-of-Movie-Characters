He then fumbles for his water bottle and takes a sip.]What food have we got left?[smiles] Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it Sam?[Exasperated] It\u0092s because we\u0092ve been here before! We\u0092re going in circles.Yes. I can smell it. [Drops to a whisper] We\u0092re not alone.[menacingly] This is Sting. You\u0092ve seen it before, haven\u0092t you... Gollum! Release him or I\u0092ll cut your throat!Maybe he does deserve to die, but now that I see him, I do pity him.There\u0092s no promise you can make that I can trust.The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word.Sam!You know the way to Mordor?You\u0092ve been there before?You will lead us to the Black Gate.[Looks at Gollum in perplexed gratitude and disbelief.] Gollum...What did you say?[Moves over and crouches in front of Gollum] Who are you?Gandalf told me you were one of the River Folk.He said your life was a sad story.You were not so very different from a hobbit once, were you... Sm\u00e9agol?That was your name once, wasn\u0092t it? A long time ago.Argh!Argh!!I did.Sam, no!I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.Now!Are you saying there\u0092s another way into Mordor?He\u0092s led us this far, Sam.He\u0092s been true to his word.Lead the way, Sm\u00e9agol.Why do you do that?Call him names; run him down all the time.[Glaring at Sam] You have no idea what it did to him. What it\u0092s still doing to him. [He walks past Sam and stops.] I want to help him, Sam...Because I have to believe he can come back.[Snapping at Sam]What do you know about it? Nothing![With remorse] I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that.[Grows angry again] I know what I have to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to me! It's my task! Mine! My own! [He walks away]We\u0092ve got to get moving. Come on, Sam.[Looking around] Sm\u00e9agol?We\u0092ve lingered here too long. Come on, Sam!We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.[The merest hesitation.] There was no other.We set out from Rivendell with seven companions. One we lost in M\u00f3ria. Two were my kin. A Dwarf there was also, and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.Yes... for my part.[Shocked] Dead? How? When?Wait! [Faramir stops] This creature is bound to me. And I to him. He is our guide. Please, let me go down to him.Sm\u00e9agol. [Gollum turns round at Frodo\u0092s voice.] Master is here. Come, Sm\u00e9agol. Trust master. Come!Sm\u00e9agol, you must trust master. Follow me, come on. Come. Come, Sm\u00e9agol. Nice Sm\u00e9agol. That\u0092s it. Come on.Don\u0092t hurt him! Sm\u00e9agol don\u0092t struggle! Sm\u00e9agol listen to me!I can\u0092t. You were right, Sam. You tried to tell me, but I\u0092m sorry. The Ring\u0092s taking me Sam. If I put it on, he\u0092ll find me. He\u0092ll see.No!! [He runs away from Faramir][With tears in his eyes] The Ring will not save Gondor. It has only the power to destroy. Please, let me go.Faramir, you must let me go!It\u0092s calling to him, Sam. His eye is almost on me.[In a faraway voice] They\u0092re here. They\u0092ve come.Aaarrgghh!!![Slowly and with despair] I can\u0092t do this, Sam.What are we holding on to, Sam?What?Huh, you left out one of the chief characters \u0096 Samwise the Brave.

The one place in Middle-earth we don\u0092t want to see any closer, and the one place we\u0092re trying to get to. It\u0092s just where we can\u0092t get. Let\u0092s face it, Mr. Frodo, we\u0092re lost. I don\u0092t think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.Mr. Frodo? It\u0092s the Ring, isn\u0092t it?Well, let me see. [He takes out a package of lembas bread from his pack] Oh yes, lovely \u0096 Lembas bread. And look! [He digs deeper into his pack] More lembas bread.I don't usually hold with foreign food, but this Elvish stuff, it\u0092s not bad.Those rain clouds might.[Looks around] This looks strangely familiar.Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrant there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you smell it?Quiet you!It\u0092s hopeless! Every Orc in Mordor\u0092s going to hear this racket! Let\u0092s just tie him up and leave him.It\u0092s no more than you deserve!I don\u0092t believe you! [Gollum backs away, frightened, and climbs onto a boulder] Get down! I said, down!He\u0092s trying to trick us! We let him go he\u0092ll throttle us in our sleep!Whoa, it\u0092s a bog! He\u0092s led us into a swamp!There are dead things! Dead faces in the water!Ohh!Frodo![Runs to Frodo\u0092s side.] Mr. Frodo! Are you alright?Black Riders!C\u0092mon Frodo! C'mon!I thought they were dead!Mr. Frodo! It\u0092s alright. I\u0092m here.Oh save us. My ol' Gaffer'd have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.That\u0092s it then. We cannot get past that.Look! The gate, it's opening! I can see a way down.Argh!!I know, Mr Frodo. I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.Why haven\u0092t you spoken of this before?!He\u0092s up to something.Mr. Frodo, no.[Whispers] No!Hey Stinker! Don\u0092t go getting too far ahead!What?Because because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in 'im but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about.Why?You can\u0092t save him, Mr. Frodo.[Looks back at Frodo with tears in his eyes.] I do. It's the Ring. You can't take your eyes off it. I've seen you. You're not eating. You barely sleep. It's taken a hold of you, Mr Frodo. You have to fight it!Can\u0092t you hear yourself? Don\u0092t you know who you sound like?You\u0092ll make him sick, you will, behaving like that! [Holding up the two rabbits] There\u0092s only one way to eat a brace of coneys.What\u0092s to ruin? There\u0092s hardly any meat on \u0091em.What we need is a few good taters.PO-TAY-TOES! Boil \u0091em. Mash \u0091em. Stick \u0091em in a stew. Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish....Even you couldn\u0092t say no to that. [He takes a sip of the stew]You\u0092re hopeless.Mr. Frodo?Who are they?Ready to do what?[Suddenly grabs Frodo\u0092s arm] Mr Frodo! Look! It\u0092s an Oliphaunt!No one at home will believe this...Ah!Spies?! Now wait just a minute!His gardener.We have to get out of here. You go. Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. Disappear.Mr. Frodo...Stop it! Leave him alone! Don\u0092t you understand? He\u0092s got to destroy it. That\u0092s where we\u0092re going. Into Mordor. To the mountain of fire.Please. It\u0092s such a burden. Will you not help him?Mr Frodo!Hold on, Mr. Frodo You'll be alright...Do you want to know what happened to Boromir? You want to know why your brother died? He tried to take the Ring from Frodo! After swearing an oath to protect him, he tried to kill him! The Ring drove your brother mad!Mr Frodo?What are you doing? Where are you going?![With tears running down his face] It\u0092s me. It\u0092s your Sam. Don\u0092t you know your Sam?[Getting up slowly] I know. It\u0092s all wrong. By rights we shouldn\u0092t even be here. But we are. [He stands and leans against a wall, looking out into the distance.] It\u0092s like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn\u0092t want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? [Images of the riders winning the battle against the Uruk-hai at Helm\u0092s Deep] How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?But in the end, it\u0092s only a passing thing, this shadow. [The women and children welcome the men as they return. \u00c9owyn runs up to Aragorn and embraces him, crying tears of relief.] Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. [Isengard is flooded. Merry and Pippin looks on from their perch on Treebeard. On the balcony, Saruman stumbles back into his chamber] And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn\u0092t. They kept going because they were holding on to something.There\u0092s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it\u0092s worth fighting for.I wonder if we\u0092ll ever be put into songs or tales.I wonder if people will ever say, \u0091let\u0092s hear about Frodo and the Ring.\u0092 And they\u0092ll say \u0091yes, that\u0092s one of my favorite stories. Frodo was really courageous, wasn\u0092t he, dad.\u0092 \u0091Yes, my boy, the most famousest of hobbits. And that\u0092s saying alot.\u0092Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldn\u0092t make fun. I was being serious.[Dreamily] Samwise the Brave. [He gives his backpack a heave and follows Frodo]We\u0092re not gonna wait for you. Come on!Where\u0092s he gone?

[Flashback: Merry rubs his bonds furiously against the sharp edge of a weapon.] Their bonds were cut. [Aragorn holds up a broken length of thick rope.]They ran over here. They were followed.The tracks lead away from the battle... [They break into a run and then stop] into Fangorn Forest.These are strange tracks.[Whispers] Gimli![Gestures] Lower your axe.Man cenich?Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us.We must be quick.Where are they?Who are you? Show yourself!It cannot be. You fell.Gandalf!Wait.No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go.
