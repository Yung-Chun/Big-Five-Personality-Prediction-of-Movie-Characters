{"Ninotchka": {"LEON": {"raw_line": "Good morning.That's all right.Good morning, Swana.Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. \"The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia\"!Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!Well, I am the last person to persuade you, but don't do it blindly... if this is your decision, you must be prepared to face the consequences... I will have to go to work.Now, Swana...Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. \"Caviar and Blood.\" Swana escapes over the ice!Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!Count Rakonin?Oh, yes.Did I hear something about jewels?What does he say?What did he say?Darling, calm down. Why do you need a lawyer? Haven't you your little Volga boatman?My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.Monsieur Mercier. May I introduce myself? I am Count Leon d'Algout. I think I had the pleasure of meeting you in your beautiful shop. I was admiring a platinum watch with diamond numbers.Glorious, aren't they?Just a moment. I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.These jewels are the property of the Duchess Swana of Russia, and were seized illegally by the Soviet Government. I am acting for Her Highness, the Duchess. Here is my power of attorney.We'll leave the problem of their ownership to the French courts. Meanwhile I have filed a petition for an injunction to prohibit you from either selling or removing the jewels. Here is a copy.I thought it my duty to warn you. I would hate to see you get in any trouble, monsieur.I hope you will forgive me, Monsieur Mercier.Good day, monsieur.Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. All is not lost. You may have a chance.Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!The Duchess...In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?I just said let's have a little lunch. Room service.Hey, Sascha! Serge! Misha!About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow.How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski.I'll send you a muff.Take this telegram to the telegraph office at once!Me?Gladly.Well -- until the policeman whistles again.What?That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.No.You're welcome.Can I help you?Love to.Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.Now, isn't that too bad! The last time I jumped I forgot to clock it! Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your finger, please.Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?I don't have to but I find it natural.I'll try.Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square... I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side. The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees...Yes, very strange.Ascending to the tower is a staircase consisting of eight hundred and twenty- nine steps... ...and an additional two hundred and fifty-four steps to the very top... There is an elevator included in the price of admission!And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Boh\u00e8me... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction! It will cost me a franc but it is worth it. The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look.... What do you see?It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...Please don't misunderstand me...Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.I will do my best.Good evening, Gaston.Yes.He takes good care of that.No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.Go to bed.Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?We take off our hat and coat. We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile. Well... we don't smile. How about some music?It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.Thank you. Thank you.I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.Ni-notchka.Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?Thank you.Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?Oh, I see. What do you use instead?What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...I'd like to say it a thousand times.I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.The bayonet? Did you really?Wounded? How?I'd love to. Tsk, tsk, tsk.Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.What kind of a girl are you, anyway?You're the most adorable cog I ever saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska, let me confess something. Never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant.Do you hear that?It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?I can't possibly think of a better reason.You analyze everything out of existence. You analyze me out of existence. I won't let you. Love is not so simple. Ninotchka, Ninotchka, why do doves bill and coo? Why do snails, coldest of all creatures, circle interminably around each other? Why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates? Why do flowers open their petals? Oh, Ninotchka, Ninotchka, surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion... a general warmth in the palms of your hands... a strange heaviness in your limbs... a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing, more exalting, than thirst?Was that talkative?Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...Glorious, analytical...Oh, let it ring.Hello?... Yes... I'm sorry but I couldn't make it. I ran into a friend from the army... What?... The deal is off! Are you crazy, Buljanoff?......A special envoy arrived... What?... That sounds better. I'll be glad to see her any time she wants... Oh, she doesn't want to see me? What do you know about that? Why?... Well, I'll get in touch with her myself. What's her name?... ...What?... Yaku... How do you spell it?... Heavens! those Russian names! ...I... Oh, Y...Yakushova... Ninotch...All right. Thank you.Ninotchka...Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.You know I want to...Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!Huh?No.I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!I don't feel like any breakfast.Make it ice cold.Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her. She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.You can't imagine.Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open!Hello, boys.Come in, come in.What's new?What did she say about me?Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!No, no.Oh, yes, yes.Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.Room service speaking.So! You want to make a strike breaker out of me! I am surprised at you, Comrade! Is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch? All I can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that Royal Suite!Why, hello! It certainly is a small world!Crayfish soup for me!Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how? By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!I didn't follow you.I always eat here.But my dear child, I am most at home among working men. I hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence... This is my natural element. After all, what are any of us? Workingmen! At least, those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah?Hyah!Hyah, fellows!They are all my friends. They're a swell bunch!Ah, my friend! I'm happy to see you again!Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.Must one always be after something?Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice. When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!Will you smile?Just smile.At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.Because we are an odd couple.No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not yet. Not until I've made you laugh... at least once.That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.Do you like Scotch stories?Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, \"Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy,\" and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, \"Hello, Mr. McIntosh,\" and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, \"How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?\" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, \"How is Mrs. McIntosh?\"...So do I. Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha! Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, \"Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?\" \"Yes, it is,\" says the other, \"five hundred million.\" \"Whew!\" replies the first, \"they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!\" Ha! Ha! Ha!I suppose you don't think that's funny?It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!Maybe you haven't any sense of humor. Well, I'll give you one more chance! Now listen!When I heard this joke for the first time I laughed myself sick. Here goes! A man comes into a restaurant and sits down and says, \"Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream.\" After five minutes the waiter comes back and says, \"I'm sorry, sir, we're all out of cream, can it be without milk?\"Not funny, huh?So you don't think that's funny? It is funny! Everyone else thinks so! Maybe you didn't get it.I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, \"Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee.\" So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, \"I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee.\"... Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up... A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, \"Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream,\" and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, \"I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!\"Ah! You have no sense of humor! That settles it! You have no sense of humor! None! No humor!!What's funny about this?What time have you, Gaston?I guess it is eight forty-two.I am, Gaston.Have you?And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, \"Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike\"?Go to bed, little father, go to bed.Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, \"Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other.\" Ninotchka feels more comfortable.You remember this room?You see? Life can be so simple.Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence? The son-of-a-gun made a detour!... But he got you here.That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, \"What are your plans for this evening, madame?\"A wonderful idea! Radio or records?I'll play it softly because I have things to tell you about which I can't shout.Well, my darling... I... we...You see I couldn't shout that.No... go on.What a gesture for a sergeant.Anything, Ninotchka.I promise... I swear.I don't think so.Ninotchka, I love you.Ninotchka, you're jealous.My darling.Is it dry?Is that right or do you prefer it sweet?It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast. To us, Ninotchka!Hello, Swana. How do you do, General Savitzky?Thank you.Yes, Swana.Yes, Swana, you did.Yes, Swana.Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?And General Savitzky.No... please...Months, Swana.There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.Good night, Swana.A funny story?Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one. The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?You must, darling.You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.What, darling?Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right.Darling, darling... please!Shhh! Shhh!But, darling, you can't do that.Now, Ninotchka... please!Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.No speech.And I adore you, Ninotchua.Give me a double brandy.Give me another double brandy.What can I do about it?You want me to go in there?Make it a triple brandy. As weAll right... you can tell the Duchess... you can tell everybody... they know anyhow... it doesn't make any difference... now get out!No. Nobody will find us.Yes... a little white house.All right, we'll make it red.Right: Lovers of the world unite!No! No!No! No!Yes... a kiss... salute!I know... it's the Russian soul.Would that make you any happier?All right.Let's turn on the radio.It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.What shall we get? The news!Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.Well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!No, no music.But I can throw it out of the window....but big.Who cried that one?Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, \"Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!\"Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.I give them back to the people... I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People!It is their wish.Please.Yes, sweetheart.No thanks, Swana.I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.Yes.This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.I'm afraid that's what it is.What is this, Swana?Has done what?Do you expect me to believe that?Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.Don't hold that against me... please!Business.Private.Confess what?On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.Oh... I think it's great! Everyone works -- everyone contributes -- that's what I want to do -- work! I make my own bed -- you can call up my butler! I don't believe in the right of the individual. I like the Bolshevik ideal -- everyone being the same. You just like me -- me just like you -- I use your comb -- you use my toothbrush -- oh, it's a great life.... Please... give me that visa!Hello.Now, please, Swana.That does it, Swana. Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious.She must have her little joke. You're not going to take that seriously.Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.Yes!I must get into that country of yours!That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!On what?What for... why?Suspicions... nothing but suspicions!... That's the trouble with you! If you don't let me in I'll stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from Russia!... I'll picket your whole country....I'll boycott you, that's what I'm going to do!... No more vodka... no more caviar... no more Tchaikovsky... no more borscht.... Wait a minute, I know something better than that...And you can tell the Kremlin that's just the beginning!They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.I won't tell you what came between... I'll prove it. It will take a long time, Ninotchka... at least a lifetime.If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back.

wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?Did you win?Oh, Leon, you are so good to me.Those newspaper people?What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!Oh, Leon!Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages! I can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments!My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this. Are you my little Volga boatman?First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?Well... two million readers... I know exactly what they want. Chapter One: \"A Childhood behind Golden Bars. Lovely Little Princess Plays with Rasputin's Beard.\"A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!Come in.He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.Tell him I won't be able to see him for a half an hour.How do you do, my friend.What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?My jewels?!Why do you bring this up after so many years?Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!Balzac 2769... My lawyer...Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon! ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!Shhh! ...But how can there be a question?... Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All right, I'll let you know!It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!Good morning, Gaston.That's all right.Leon! What in heaven's name...!Is anything wrong? Are you ill?Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much. You look so pale... pale but interesting.Come in.Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.Not in your condition. Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit. Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!You haven't seen her yet?That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.You just told me you hadn't seen her.Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?That bad? Old or young?You saw all that in one glimpse?Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.Gaston!Yes?Oh... you are the three gentlemen from Moscow?You may wait.Leon! Just a minute...I'm leaving, dear. I'm lunching at Fouquet's if you can make it, and... Leon, remember, a man should think it over twice before he decides to become a mother.Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?Count d'Algout...No, that's another party.No, no! This is glory! At last I'm going to have a look at that female Bolshevik. Can you give us another table?That's perfect!Isn't it divine?Now, we must be very discreet. If she sucks her soup and drinks out of her finger bowl, I don't want anyone to laugh. We must not embarrass little Leon. He is going through enough for my sake. We mustn't add insult to injuryThank you, Louis.I'm only afraid that the doorman may spoil our fun. If only he lets her in!Yes, General Savitzky?Are they indeed? Thank you.General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?Shall we dance, General Savitzky?Hello, Leon! What a surprise! You of all people! How are you, my dear?You're looking magnificent, Leon... ...isn't he, General Savitzky?Is this your new dress suit?Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?Am I interrupting?How do you do?I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.Well, Leon, we can be proud of our Punchy. He had a triumph at the dog show.He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier. You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday. You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.I'm going, Leon... but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia. It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?You're absolutely right about the Cossacks. We made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts. They had such reliable guns.A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree. The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris. Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow. Good night. Good night, Leon.Good morning.It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow noon, to be exact. I hope you will forgive me. I know it's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour. Don't you recognize me? I am the Duchess Swana.I know how you feel, my dear. The morning after always does look grim if you happen to be wearing last night's dress. Don't be embarrassed by my presence, though. You couldn't have found anybody more sympathetic to your condition. I remember once in Petrograd when I felt exactly as you do. I had to bow from a balcony to the crowd. My dear, the masses have no understanding of the feelings of a lady before noon. Don't you find that true?Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous! Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.Don't worry, you were quite rude enough. Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.That's all right... I grow on people.Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had... but nothing more -- I warn you.Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.Believe me, Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it.You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian. I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.Unfortunately.My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova.Good afternoon, Jacqueline.You didn't find my glove. All right, you're forgiven.Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...All right, I'll listen.Brutal frankness, if you insist.And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again. By about five minutes.Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.She's gone, Leon.Here's the telephone. If you call the hotel you will find that you have no seven o'clock appointment.Hello, Leon darling!After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you. May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia.Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little ch\u00e2teau in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a

Present me to your colleagues.Comrade.Comrade.Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?What do you want?Why?Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?That's no business... that's a social injustice.No, thank you.Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.What's that?Tsk, tsk, tsk, how can such a civilization survive which permits women to put things like that on their heads. It won't be long now, Comrades.Which part of the room is mine?How much does this cost?A week?Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows. Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this. Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.I hope so for your sake. Let us examine the case. What does the lawyer say?You didn't get legal advice?I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.Comrade Buljanoff...Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?Will you send me some cigarettes, please? Comrades, I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State. You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. And you three comrades...We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property.You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.Come in.Comrades, you seem to have been smoking a lot.Good evening. She exits out the door.You, please.Yes. Could you give me some information?How long do we have to wait here?At what intervals does he whistle?How many minutes between the first and second whistle?Have you never been caught in a similar situation?In other words you don't know.Thank you.You might hold this for me.Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.How long does it take a man to land?Why do you need my finger?And where are we?I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?Suppress it.For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.Your type will soon be extinct.Please... can you tell me the exact width of the foundation on which the piers are resting?... and the depth?I am not afraid... I want to know...Go ahead.That's a strange angle.You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.Yes, it is.Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you. As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?So that is your house?Does that mean that you want me to go there?Then you don't want me to go there.Then why don't we go? You might be an interesting subject of study.Is this what you call the \"butler\"?Good evening, comrade. This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.He looks sad. Do you whip him?The day will come when you will be free. Go to bed, little father. We want to be alone.Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.What do we do now?Is that customary?I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.I will start with you.And what is your profession?And what do you do for mankind?You are something we do not have in Russia.That is why I believe in the future of my country.You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.That is correct.Your general appearance is not distasteful.Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.You repeat yourself.Don't do it, please.It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.I was wounded before Warsaw.I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.Don't pity me. Pity the Polish lancer. After all, I'm alive.Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.It's twelve o'clock.That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.It's false sentimentality.You are very talkative.No, that was restful. Again.Thank you.The telephone is ringing.But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer.I must go.Let's forget that we ever met.I was sent here by my country to fight you.As a representative of Moscow...It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...Then do it through my lawyer!I must go.I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.You are referring to paragraph 59b, section 25f of the Civil Code.Page eight hundred twenty-four.And do not fail to read the three footnotes. While you are studying it I will eat. Food please.Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.Tsk, tsk, tsk.Can you recommend a restaurant?Where do you eat?Where is that?Where is it?Thank you.This will do.Raw carrots and beets.Bring me something simple. I never think about food.The future of the common people.I don't like your following me.Then how did you get here?This is a place for workmen.What are you after?Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.What?Why?At what?Why?Then you should go back to your table.Ha! Ha! Now go back.On which boat?Probably not.I have never heard one.I wish they had never met.No.I don't think so.No.Yes.Yes.I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story... It still makes me laugh. It is very funny. I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...That's two weeks from Thursday...I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Why get excited?Au revoir.Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed? Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?Have you any money?Well, here are fifty francs.Bring me forty-five back.I don't look too foolish?I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said \"Eight Rue du Bois\"... and here I am.For twelve francs, seventy-five.It's nine o'clock.Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket. Then could we have some music?Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...Leon, I would like to ask you something.If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.Did you make any change in this room?When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what a waste of silver. That's all that interested me then. Now I would like to know... what happened to the woman?The Duchess.She is very attractive. She has great elegance. She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.Ugh... um... oh... It's good.From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?How do you do?How do you do?Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.No, last year, madame.Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.Now I think I need a glass of champagne.Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.Go on.Wonderful -- if one could believe it.To the loveliest story I ever heard.Shall we dance?Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!Thursday.Comrades! Comrades!I must talk to my brothers!Don't shush me. I am People! I want to make a speech. I want to overthrow the Duchess!Comrades! Good people of France!They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.No speech?I love you, my little Leonitchka!Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.Are we going to build our little house?Not white, darling.No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.And we won't stretch up our arms......and we won't clench our fist...Our salute will be a kiss.I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished. I want to confess, darling.Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the wall.Much happier.I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.Radio! What is radio?Oh yes, yes. It has a little knob that turns... a little knob... it must be somewhere around here... yes... here... I see...Here it is!No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...It's dead.Now twice to the left and stop at seventeen.No music.There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street. There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels.......they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.First ten thousand serfs... now just Gaston. It is very encouraging.They belong to the people.Is this the wish of the masses?Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses. Can I make a speech now?Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry? Let us be happy... give us our moment.... We are happy, aren't we, Leon?So happy and so tired.Smile, little father, smile.What?I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.Please come to the point. What is it you want?We have nothing to discuss.Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... \"I am delighted to have you here\"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.I must ask you to leave.Madame, if you...If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.I must insist that you leave.In that case I can only say good-by.\u00c9lys\u00e9e 2763.I told you to go, madame.Where are they?Where are they?You leave me no choice.I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.Go on.That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.Yes... Oh hello...Good morning, Leon... ... no, you didn't waken me... I am fine, thank you.... Yes, it was... marvelous.... What?... for luncheon? I'm afraid I can't. I am going to be very busy... well, I have a lot of things to attend to today.... What?... Well to tell you the truth I am a little tired and I would like to rest... you may be right... perhaps it is the champagne.... For dinner?... Of course... seven o'clock here?... seven o'clock is all right.... Where?... That will be lovely.... Yes... Come in. Yes?... Just a moment...You can leave it here.Operator, will you switch the call please?... Hello?... Darling, your present just arrived.... It's very silly and very wonderful... thank you... No, I won't forget... seven o'clock.... Good-by, my darling.... What?... Oh... salute!I am sorry to have kept you waiting, madame.Yes, it is an amazing piece of engineering. Still the most remarkable iron structure in the world. Leading to the top there is a staircase of over a thousand steps... but an elevator is included in the price of admission.Good evening, Anna.Aren't you late?Didn't you march?Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.A few friends... just a little dinner party.An omelet.Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.You should be more careful, Anna.About what?I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.I have nothing to hide.I see.Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.Well, a hat...It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.An evening gown.A dress you wear in the evening.When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.Yes.No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.You feel it, though.What is it, Anna?You want this?You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.No music.How are you, you three scoundrels?Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.Now let's forget everything except that we're together.Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.We will get that... we'll get everything... maybe a little bit later but we'll get it... We must be patient... Finally we got the spring, didn't we? We got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too.Don't worry... there will be enough.It's from Paris.From Leon.Look for yourselves.Good night, my friends.Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.Yes, it does.Yes.I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.May I ask why?Thank you.No.May I ask what has happened?Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?You want me to go to Constantinople?I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.I will do my best.But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.I must be stern with you.Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.But, Comrades...Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.And there is a Russian saying: \"The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses.\"Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?Guest?You mean you are deserting Russia?Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this?So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.The one I got they wouldn't let me read. It began, \"Ninotchka, my darling,\" and ended, \"Yours, Leon.\"But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.Well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can I waver?
