You mind yours.Get out of here! Get out! Get out!It wasn't my fault, Charlie. He made me send your wife a note. He said I'd - oh, he's been saying the most terrible things, I didn't know what to do... I -I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie. You haven't got any idea -I'm Susan Alexander. I know what you think, Mrs. Kane, but -Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -There is no story. It's all lies. Mr. Kane is just -What about me? He said my name'd be dragged through the mud. He said everywhere I'd go from now on -Charlie! If they publish this story -Charlie, you're just excited. You don't realize -Charlie, there are other things to think of. Your son - you don't want him to read in the papers -Charlie, please don't -How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?You wouldn't want to hear a lot of what comes into my mind about myself and Mr. Charlie Kane.I had a toothache.That was thiry years ago - and I still remember that toothache. Boy! That toothache was just driving me crazy...I'm sorry, mister - but you do look awful funny.Ow!Toothache.You've got some on your face.You are. You look like you've been making mud pies.Oh!If you want to come in and wash your face - I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -My landlady prefers me to keep this door open when I have a gentleman caller. She's a very decent woman. Ow!Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa.No. They've passed on.In the water.I always like to see the funny side of things. No sense crying when you don't have to. And you're so funny. Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.Oh!I know... But you do look so silly.On the chiffonier. Here.I've got a brush in the closet. As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.A chicken?A rooster?Excuse me, Mr. Kane. I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you? I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, guess you caught on to that -No. That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -You've been wonderful! I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and -I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.Oh, me -I didn't say.Pretty old. I'll be twenty-two in August.I work at Seligman's.I want to be a singer. I mean, I didn't. Mother did for me.Oh, no! Nothing like that. Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me. Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.Well, I -Oh, no, that's all gone.I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie - I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -What do you mean?I didn't get a thing. Just the music lessons. That's all there was to it.He was in love with me. But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.He wanted me to be comfortable - Oh, why should I bother? You don't believe me, but it's true. It just happens to be true. He was really interested in my voice. What are you smiling for? What do you think he built that opera house for? I didn't want it. I didn't want to sing. It was his idea - everything was his idea - except my leaving him.You don't propose to have yourself made ridiculous? What about me? I'm the one that has to do the singing. I'm the one that gets the razzberries. Last week, when I was shopping, one of the salesgirls did an imitation of me for another girl. She thought I didn't see her, but - Charlie, you might as well make up your mind to it. This is one thing you're not going to have your own way about. I can't sing and you know it - Why can't you just -I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie. I just couldn't - I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you. That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you. Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you. They just -What time is it?Charlie! I said, what time is it?I mean in New York.At night?Hurray for the bulldog! Half past eleven! The shows have just let out. People are going to night clubs and restaurants. Of course, we're different. We live in a palace - at the end of the world.Can't we go back, Charlie?Charlie -If I promise to be a good girl! Not to drink - and to entertain all the governors and the senators with dignity - Charlie -It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.It's not a habit. I do it because I like it.Invite everybody! Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents! Who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own - with their own bath, where they know where everything is?I'm not going to put up with it.I mean it. Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so don't do what I say I'm going to - but -I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think - - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business. You've got no right -Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be. I was once. Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to. You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you. What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at? It's only money. It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.Well, I'm not going to stop it. I'm going to say exactly what I think. You've never given me anything. You've tried to buy me into giving you something. You're - - it's like you were bribing me! That's what it's been from the first moment I met you. No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known. Tried to bribe them!Love! You don't love anybody! Me or anybody else! You want to be loved - that's all you want! I'm Charles Foster Kane. Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me! Don't expect me to love you -You - you hit me.You'll never have another chance to hit me again. Never knew till this minute -Don't tell me you're sorry.I'm going to leave you.Yes.Tell Arnold I'm ready, Marie. He can get the bags.- And left? Of course they'll hear. I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.You can't stop me.Goodbye, Charlie.Let's not start all over again, Charlie. We've said everything that can be said.I see - it's you that this is being done to! It's not me at all. Not how I feel. Not what it means to me. I can't do this to you! Oh, yes I can.In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -They haven't been tough on me. I just lost my money. But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -Don't you think I do? You say you're going down to Xanadu?I know. If you're smart, you'll talk to Raymond. That's the butler. You can learn a lot from him. He knows where the bodies are buried.Well, what do you know? It's morning already.

Mom!I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher. I just try everything I can think of.Can you prove it isn't?Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -That's all right. We have no secrets from our readers. Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein. He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein. Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not. Let me see - Mike!Dear Wheeler - You provide the prose poems - I'll provide the war.I rather like it myself. Send it right away.Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?The trouble is, Mr. Thatcher, you don't realize you're talking to two people.As Charles Foster Kane, who has eighty-two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you. Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him. You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.On the other hand - I am the publisher of the Enquirer. As such, it is my duty - I'll let you in on a little secret, it is also my pleasure - to see to it that decent, hard-working people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money - mad pirates because, God help them, they have no one to look after their interests! I'll let you in on another little secret, Mr. Thatcher. I think I'm the man to do it. You see, I have money and property -If I don't defend the interests of the underprivileged, somebody else will - maybe somebody without any money or any property and that would be too bad.Do you know how to tap, Mr. Thatcher? You ought to learn -You're right. We did lose a million dollars last year.We expect to lost a million next year, too. You know, Mr. Thatcher - at the rate of a million a year - we'll have to close this place in sixty years.We've got a nice plant here.Was the show covered by every department?And the notice?Is it good?It isn't finished?That's Leland, isn't it?Has he said when he'll finish?He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?Where is he?That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.What does it say there?What's he written?Thais.Go on!Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low... Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein. I'm dictating it.Get me a typewriter. I'll finish the notice.Thank you, Mr Carter. This is Mr. Leland.Are they standing for me?Ask them to sit down.I don't my plans myself.As a matter of fact, I haven't got any. Except to get out a newspaper.Oh, Mr. Bernstein!If you would come here a moment, please, Mr. Bernstein?Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.You've got a private office here, haven't you?I'm going to live right here. As long as I have to.That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter. The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean. There's a front page story in the \"Chronicle,\" and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing. Probably murdered. A Mrs. Harry Silverstone. Why didn't the \"Enquirer\" have that this morning?I'm still hungry, Brad. Let's go to Rector's and get something decent. The \"Chronicle\" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter. Why haven't we?If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough. The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -The \"Chronicle\" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter. It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter. Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone. Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the \"Enquirer\" will have him arrested. Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist.Oh, Mr. Bernstein!I've just made a shocking discovery. The \"Enquirer\" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!What makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid, something inflexible, that people are supposed to pay two cents for -Two cents.Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.Ready for dinner, Brad?It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein. A new broom sweeps clean.These pages aren't made up as I want them, Mr. Smathers. We go to press in five minutes.It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.Let's remake these pages, Mr. Smathers. We'll have to publish a half hour late, that's all.You can remake them now, can't you, Mr. Smathers?After the types 've been reset and the pages have been remade according to the way I told you before, Mr. Smathers, kindly have proofs pulled and bring them to me. Then, if I can't find any way to improve them again - - I suppose we'll have to go to press.Tired?A wasted day.I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein. That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print - I've got to make the \"New York Enquirer\" as important to New York as the gas in that light.My Declaration of Principles - Don't smile, Brad - Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -I'll write it myself.These'll be kept. I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly. will also provide them -People are going to know who's responsible. And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly. And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news.Let's hope they like it there.Look at that.It's a good idea for a newspaper. Four hundred sixy thousand.You're right, Mr. Bernstein.I know.Make up an extra copy and mail it to the \"Chronicle.\"Gentlemen of the \"Enquirer\"! This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists - Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the \"Enquirer's\" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.All of you - new and old - You're all getting the best salaries in town. Not one of you has been hired because of his loyalty. It's your talent I'm interested in. That talent that's going to make the \"Enquirer\" the kind of paper I want - the best newspaper in the world!However, I think you'll agree we've heard enough about newspapers and the newspaper business for one night. There are other subjects in the world.Thank you.Thanks.I promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers -- and to forget about the new feature sections - and not to try to think up and ideas for comic sections.Goodbye, gents! Hey!You don't expect me to keep any of those promises, do you?Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.We certainly do. Vacation's over - starting right after dinner. But right now - that lady over there - - that's the new society editor, I take it? You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?Miss Townsend -I've been away for several months, and I don't know exactly how these things are handled now. But one thing I wanted to be sure of is that you won't treat this little announcement any differently than you would any other similar announcement.Read it, Miss Townsend. And remember - just the regular treatment! See you at nine o'clock, Mr. Bernstein!There are other subjects in the world -Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad. We'll cover it the way the \"Hickville Gazette\" covers the church social! The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes - I tell you, Brad, I envy you. By Bradford Leland, the \"Enquirer's\" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -All right, Brad, all right - you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - I'd want to. Hello, Georgie.If everybody's having fun, that's the way I want it.How would the \"Enquirer\" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?And I do it because they do it, and they do it - it's a vicious circle, isn't it? I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad - you know, Georgie, don't you?I told you about Brad, Georgie. He needs to relax.Some ships with wonderful wines have managed to slip through the enemy fleet that's blockading New York harbor - Georgie knows a young lady whom I'm sure you'd adore - wouldn't he, Georgie? Why only the other evening I said to myself, if Brad were only here to adore this young lady - this - What's her name again?Say, Brad. I've got an idea.I mean I've got a job for you.You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?You start tomorrow night. Richard Carl in \"The Spring Chicken.\" I'll get us some girls. You get tickets. A drama critic gets them free, you know. Rector's at seven?Yes?You're wrong. It does make a difference to you - Rector's, Brad? Come to think of it, I don't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent. You won't miss anything. It isn't much of a war. Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island.You don't expect me to keep any of those promises, do you?I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President! I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high- pressure crooks!It's the only vein I know. I tell the facts the way I see them. And any man that knows that facts -Thanks.I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me. However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -Mr. President.All right. Let her slide!It's a news story! Get it on the street!Take dictation - Front page editorial - \"This afternoon a great man was assassinated. He was the President of the United States -\"Yes?Why not?What do you mean by that?What do you mean by that?Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the \"Enquirer\" in his pocket?I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -They're true! Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks - Nobody can blame me because -What lesson? Not to expose fraud when I see it? Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property? Run it the way I said, Reilly - \"This afternoon a great man was assassinated -\"I don't have to. I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that. Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece. I've got to think of her.I've got to think of Emily -Go ahead.What's wrong, Brad?I'll get you some coffee.That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you - Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?Why, Brad?I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.All right.I don't think so, Brad. We've just had word that the President is out of danger. It seems I didn't kill him after all.Brad, you are drunk.Why is she leaving me?Do you think the \"Enquirer\" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?The personal note is all there is to it. It's all there ever is to it. It's all there every is to anything! Stupidity in our government, complacency and self- satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people. They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.Are you finished?You're not going to like it in Chicago. They wind comes howling in from the lake. And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -Nothing - if she dosen't love me -It's simpler than that, Brad. A society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all. Other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at Southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -She can leave me. As a matter of fact, I've already left her. Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.Hey, Brad! I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.To love on my terms. Those are the only terms anybody knows ... his own.Are you hurt?You still want to be transferred to the other paper?Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York. It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth.Excuse us a moment, please.I said, excuse us a moment.I've been talking to Leland. Emily - You can't leave me now - not now -It isn't what it would do to my changes in politics, Emily - That isn't it - They were talking of running me for governor, but now, of course, we'll have to wait - It isn't that, Emily - It's just - the president is your uncle and they're saying I killed him.That story about the murderer having a copy of the \"Enquirer\" in his pocket - the \"Chronicle\" made that up out of whole cloth - Emily, please - He's going to be all right, you know, he's going to recover - If it will make you any happier, we had nine pages of advertising cancelled in the first mail this morning. Bernstein is afraid to open any more letters. He -What do you expect me to do? What in the world -They won't do anything to Junior, darling. Anonymous letter writers - I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right. He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind.Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?What check?Oh, yes, the bonus.It is no secret that I entered upon this campaign with no thought that I could be elected Governor of this state! It is now no secret that every straw vote, every independent pole, shows that I will be elected. And I repeat to you - my first official act as Governor will be to appoint a special District Attorney to arrange for the indictment, prosecution and conviction of Boss Edward G. Rogers!Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you.It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?I think it's beginning to dawn on Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say. With Mr. Rogers out of the way, Reilly, I think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state. Well, Mr. Bernstein?You don't really think so?Please, Mr. Bernstein.Hello, Butch! Did you like your old man's speech?I saw you! Good night, gentlemen.But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.It can wait.What's this all about, Emily? I've had a very tiring day and -I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.I'll go with you.I had no idea you had this flair for melodrama, Emiliy.Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected. To start with, I'll break your neck.In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman - is -You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -You do anything you want to do. The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust. If you want to know, they've already decided. The election Tuesday'll be only -Have you gone completely mad, Emily?You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story. You can't tell me that the voters of this state -Oh yes, there is.No.There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me. And if you think - if any of you think -Go on! Get out! I can fight this thing all alone!Get out! I've got nothing to talk to you about. If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.I know exactly what I'm doing. Get out!Too late for what? Too late for you and this - this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me? Well, you won't do it, I tell you. You won't do it!Get out, both of you!What are you waiting here for? Why don't you go?Don't you worry about me. I'm Charles Foster Kane. I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -I'm going to send you to Sing Sing, Rogers. Sing Sing!Hello, Brad.Sure, we're speaking, Brad - you're fired.Ow!It's not funny.What's the matter with you?Hmm!If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -What's funny now?You're no Venus de Milo.Thanks.I'm sorry. They live here, too?Where's the soap?You're very easily amused.I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.Where's the towel?Thanks.I'll get these streets fixed, if it's the last thing I do.You are in pain, aren't you, you poor kid?Wish there was something I could -I've got an idea, young lady. Turn around and look at me. I said, turn around and look at me, young lady.Did you ever see anybody wiggle both his ears at the same time?Watch closely! It took me two solid years at the finest boys' school in the world to learn that trick. The fellow who taught me is President of Venezuela now.That's it! Smile!No. But you're close.You're getting farther away all the time. It's a duck.You really don't know who I am?But you like me, don't you? Even though you don't know who I am?And I know too many people. Obviously, we're both lonely. Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?I was only joking! This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.You see, my mother died, too - a long time ago. Her things were put into storage out west because I had no place to put them then. I still haven't. But now I've sent for them just the same. And tonight I'd planned to make a sort of sentimental journey - - to the scenes of my youth - my childhood, I suppose - to look again at - and now -Who am I? Well, let's see. Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six - I run a couple of newspapers. How about you?How old did you say you were?I didn't think you did. If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?That's a ripe old age - What do you do?Is that what you want to do?What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?Yes -Would you sing for me?Yes, I would. That's why I asked.Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit. The newspapers, for instance. I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco... It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason. Aren't you, maestro?You can't.I knew you'd see it my way.My reasons satisfy me, Susan. You seem unable to understand them. I will not tell them to you again. You will continue with your singing.Get Dr. Corey.Thank you. I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake. The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle - I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?Of course.That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -I'm sorry. You won't have to fight them anymore. It's their loss.Half past eleven.Half past eleven.Yes. The bulldog's just gone to press.You always said you wanted to live in a palace.One thing I've never been able to understand, Susan. How do you know you haven't done them before?You may be right - I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -I was referring to myself. I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight. Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -I thought we might invite everybody to go on a picnic tomorrow. Stay at Everglades overnight. Please see that the arrangements are made, Susan.You remember my son, Mr. Bernstein.You're in a tent, darling. You're not at home. And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.You're my wife, Susan, and -We can discuss all this some other time, Susan. Right now -As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything - I don't want anything now - except what you want.Susan, I really think -Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!Susan!You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan. Whatever I do - I do - because I love you.Susan, it seems to me -I'm not sorry.No, you're not.All right.Is Mrs. Kane -Have you gone completely crazy?Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -I won't let you go.Don't go, Susan.Susan, don't go! Susan, please!You mustn't go, Susan. Everything'll be exactly the way you want it. Not the way I think you want it - by your way. Please, Susan - Susan!Don't go, Susan! You mustn't go! You - you can't do this to me, Susan -Close the door, Raymond.Lock it - and keep it locked.Raymond -Keep it locked.Do you like poetry, Raymond?Mrs. Kane liked poetry -Not my wife - not either of them.Do you know what that is?Persia. It belonged to a king.He was dead... That's a poem. Do you know what it means?I didn't used to be afraid of it.The drunkeness of youth has passed like a fever, And yet I saw many things, Seeing my glory in the days of my glory, I thought my power eternal And the days of my life Fixed surely in the years But a whisper came to me From Him who dies not. I called my tributary kings together And those who were proud rulers under me, I opened the boxes of my treasure to them, saying: \"Take hills of gold, moutains of silver, And give me only one more day upon the earth.\" But they stood silent, Looking upon the ground; So that I died And Death came to sit upon my throne. O sons of men You see a stranger upon the road, You call to him and he does not step. He is your life Walking towards time, Hurrying to meet the kings of India and China. O sons of men You are caught in the web of the world And the spider Nothing waits behind it. Where are the men with towering hopes? They have changed places with owls, Owls who have lived in tombs And now inhabit a palace.", "clean_line": "rebels want fight boys let em terms underconditional surrender em union forever lick andy

marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.That's fine, Mr. Kane.Right away.Who's a busy man? Me? I'm Chairman of the Board. I got nothing but time ... What do you want to know?From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end. Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -That Rosebud? Maybe some girl? There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -You're pretty young, Mr. - Mr. Thompson. A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me. One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in - - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off. A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl. See what I mean? Well, so what are you doing about this \"Rosebud,\" Mr. Thompson.Who else you been to see?Susie? I called her myself the day after he died. I thought maybe somebody ought to... She couldn't even come to the 'phone.Sure, sure.Who else did you see?Thatcher! That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money. Thatcher!He never knew there was anything in the world but money. That kind of fellow you can fool every day in the week - and twice on Sundays! The time he came to Rome for Mr. Kane's twenty-fifth birthday... You know, when Mr. Kane got control of his own money... Such a fool like Thatcher - I tell you, nobody's business!He knew what he wanted, Mr. Kane did, and he got it! Thatcher never did figure him out. He was hard to figure sometimes, even for me. Mr. Kane was a genius like he said. He had that funny sense of humor. Sometimes even I didn't get the joke. Like that night the opera house of his opened in Chicago... You know, the opera house he built for Susie, she should be an opera singer... That was years later, of course - 1914 it was. Mrs. Kane took the leading part in the opera, and she was terrible. But nobody had the nerve to say so - not even the critics. Mr. Kane was a big man in those days. But this one fellow, this friend of his, Branford Leland -Go in and ask him to hurry.I might make him nervous.That's right. They called us the \"Three Musketeers.\"That's a long story.I had nothing to do with it. It was Leland and Mr. Kane, and you couldn't call it a quarrel exactly. Better we should forget such things - Leland is writing it up from the dramatic angle?And the social. How about the music notice? You got that in?Enthusiastic?Well, well - isn't that nice?Hello, Mr. Kane.He sure did, Mr. Kane.MR. KANE -Leland and Mr. Kane - they haven't spoke together for ten years. Excuse me.Hey, Brad! Brad! He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never. We would have heard.\"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur - - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -\" I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.\"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department. Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to...\"That's all there is.I didn't see that.I can't take shorthand.He finished it. He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved. We ran it in every paper.He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that. He put all his ambition on that girl. After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to. Oh, I don't blame Susie -Oh, yes. He saw to that. I tell you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard man to figure out. He had that funny sense of humor. And then, too, maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show Leland he was an honest man. You see, Leland didn't think so. I guess he showed him all right. He's a nice fellow, but he's a dreamer. They were always together in those early days when we just started the Enquirer.I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!Three cents.This is all figured at three cents a copy.All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should decide to drop the price to one cent, or maybe even he should make up his mind to give the paper away with a half-pound of tea - you'll just hold him until I get back, won't you?Who said anything about brooms?Oh!We should be publishing such rags, that's all I wish. Why, the \"Enquirer\" - I wouldn't wrap up the liver for the cat in the \"Enquirer\" -In case you don't understand, Mr. Smathers - he's a new broom.It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -Wasted?You just made the paper over four times today, Mr. Kane. That's all -Can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.Sixty-two thousand -From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.Say, with them fellows - - it's no trick to get circulation.You know how long it took the \"Chronicle\" to get that staff together? Twenty years.Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy any more paintings. Nine Venuses already we got, twenty-six Virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff -Do you, Mr. Leland?Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh? Especially the new papers -Huh? Oh, I forgot - you've been away so long I forgot about your joking -Miss Townsend -This is Mr. Kane, Miss Townsend.Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Moore Norton announce -know. Come on, Miss Townsend - From the window, maybe we can get a look.A girl like that, believe me, she's lucky! Presiden't niece, huh! Say, before he's through, she'll be a Presiden't wife.The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!It ended - Then there was Susie - that ended, too. guess he didn't make her very happy -Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had - You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot. I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself. He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.You don't say! Why I had no idea -Just old age. It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, you don't look forward to being cured of. You ought to see Mr. Leland. There's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to.Isn't it wonderful? Such a party!What's the matter?Sure. They're like anybody else. They got work to do. They do it. Only they happen to be the best men in the business.Certainly not. So what's that got to do with it? Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.Do you, Mr. Leland?Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him? He wanted you to. He said to me just yesterday -Don't I always? Most of the time?Yes.If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.Against me there should be such a conspiracy some time!Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic. I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.I'm all right, Mr. Leland. Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me. I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.Not to me. But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?It's wonderful, Mr. Kane. Wonderful. Wonderful.I do. I do. I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected - I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected. Only - - Can I say something?Well, the way I look at it - - You want to know what I really think would be wonderful?Well, you're running for Governor and going to be elected - my idea is how wonderful it would be if you don't run at all and don't get elected.Hello, Mr. Leland.Mr. Kane is finishing it.Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.He's writing a roast like you wanted it to be - - I guess that'll show you.", "clean_line": "mr thatcher wire cuba mr kane food marvelous cuba senoritas beautiful stop send prose poems palm trees sunrises tropical colors blending far landscapes feel right spending money stop war cuba regards wheeler fine mr kane right away busy man chairman board got time want know beginning young fellow end want know paper rosebud maybe girl lot early days pretty young mr mr thompson fellow remember things wouldn think remember day crossing jersey ferry pulled ferry pulling girl waiting white dress carrying white pastrol saw second ll bet month hasn gone haven thought girl mean rosebud mr thompson susie called day died thought maybe somebody ought couldn come phone sure sure thatcher man biggest darn fool met trick awful lot money want lot money thatcher knew world money kind fellow fool day week twice sundays time came rome mr kane fifth birthday know mr kane got control money fool like thatcher tell business knew wanted mr kane got thatcher figure hard figure mr kane genius like said funny sense humor joke like night opera house opened chicago know opera house built susie opera singer years later course mrs kane took leading opera terrible nerve critics mr kane big man days fellow friend branford leland ask hurry nervous right called musketeers long story leland mr kane couldn quarrel exactly better forget things leland writing dramatic angle social music notice got enthusiastic isn nice hello mr kane sure mr kane mr kane leland mr kane haven spoke years excuse hey brad brad ain drinking mr kane heard miss susan alexander pretty hopelessly incompetent amateur night opened new chicago opera house performance pronounce mr kane singing happily concern department acting absolutely impossible shorthand finished wrote worst notice read girl loved ran paper thought great mr thompson believed ambition girl came cared like oh blame susie oh yes saw tell mr thompson hard man figure funny sense humor maybe thought finishing piece leland honest man leland think guess showed right nice fellow dreamer early days started enquirer ordered morning got discount cents figured cents copy right ll figures case mr leland mr kane decide drop price cent maybe mind paper away half pound tea ll hold won said brooms oh publishing rags wish enquirer wouldn wrap liver cat enquirer case understand mr smathers new broom hours minutes late wasted paper times today mr kane shorthand mr kane wanta promises mr kane wanta thousand chronicle building sign biggest thing floor guaranteed let hope bothers cost fellows trick circulation know long took chronicle staff years thousand seven mr kane buy paintings venuses got virgins warehouses stuff mr leland sit everybody heaven sake tonight thoroughly eh especially new papers huh oh forgot ve away long forgot joking miss townsend mr kane miss townsend mr mrs thomas moore norton announce know come miss townsend window maybe look girl like believe lucky presiden niece huh ll presiden wife way things turned need tell miss emily norton rosebud ended susie ended guess happy maybe lost mr kane man lost ought talk bradford leland tell lot wish tell leland know town dead idea old age disease mr thompson look forward cured ought mr leland lot things tell wanted isn wonderful party matter sure like anybody got work happen best men business certainly got mr kane ll changed kind newspapermen week mr leland mr leland europe wanted said yesterday time yes thought answer different mr kane tells wouldn conspiracy time ll coming september majestic got reservations gets ninth right mr leland fellows thought ought things learned em officer hadn come protected killed fellows let cop home mr kane won wonderful mr kane wonderful wonderful mean running governor want elected think wonderful going elected way look want know think wonderful running governor going elected idea wonderful run elected hello mr leland mr kane finishing mr kane finishing piece way started writing roast like wanted guess ll"}, "LELAND": {"raw_line": "Poor Mr. Carter!I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein. You people work too fast for me! Talk about new brooms!We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.It's been a tough day.Charlie?!What're you going to do, Charlie?That's the second sentence you've started with \"I\" -That looks pretty nice.The \"Chronicle\" is a good newspaper.Certainly not.You don't happen to have a cigar, do you? I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking... I changed the subject, didn't I? Dear, dear! What a disagreeable old man I've become. You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane? Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself. He never - gave himself away - He never gave anything away. He just - left you a tip. He had a generous mind. I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions. That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it - But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane. He never had a conviction in his life. I guess he died without one - That must have been pretty unpleasant. Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death. But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something. You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?Never mind - Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he? Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then. He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.I can remember everything. That's my curse, young man. It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race. Memory - I was his oldest friend. As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine. Maybe I wasnt' his friend. If I wasn't, he never had one. Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -Yes.Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the \"Enquirer\" - who were with the \"Chronicle\" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the \"Chronicle\" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?Do we stand for the same things that the \"Chronicle\" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?Probably. There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane - without his knowing it.Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -They do it only because you do!Yes?Good.I'd like that.Charlie -It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -Certainly not.I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite? Am I a New England school-marm?You're in a conspiracy against me, you two. You always have been.September the ninth?I used to go to dancing school with her.What's this?David, Grobleski & Davis - My dear Rawlston -Oh, yes. I know about Mr. Rawlston.I am in receipt of your favor of yesterday. I beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of Charles Foster Kane.Brief marriage! Ten years!He married for love - That's why he did everything. That's why he went into politics. It seems we weren't enough. He wanted all the voters to love him, too. All he really wanted out of life was love. That's Charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it. You see, he just didn't have any to give. He loved Charlie Kane, of course, very dearly - and his mother, I guess he always loved her. As for Emily - well, all I can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and I guess there are. I guess there's more than two sides -Charlie -Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?Why not? Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.Competition.Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor. What do you think that crowd is doing down there? They think you murdered him.- and that copy of the \"Enquirer\" said the President should be killed.You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.Charlie!Look out that window.There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it.Charlie! Now you're not making sense.What?I'd like to talk to you about that.Finish your editorial.What's happened?In there.Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein. There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.Yes, Mr. Bernstein.First of all -I'm drunk.First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the \"Enquirer.\"Charlie, it's just no go. We can't agree anymore. I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.I want to be transferred to the new paper. You've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to - That's not what I wanted to talk about.No, that won't help. Besides, you never get drunk. I wanted to talk about you and Emily.She's going to leave you -She was going to leave you anyway -Emily's going south next week with the child. As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday. When they get back -Sure I am. She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes. I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.You might have made the whole thing less personal!It isn't just that the President was her uncle - everyone she knows, all the people she's been brought up with, everything she's ever been taught to believe is important -There's no reason why this - this savage personal note -You almost convince me. I'm just drunk enough to tell you the truth. I have to be a little drunk for that because I'm a coward. You know that. That's why you keep me around. You only associate with your inferiors, Charlie. I guess that's why you ran away from Emily. Because you can't stand the company of your equals. You don't like to admit they exist - the other big people in your world are dead. I told you that.You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you. When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest. You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man? You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all. And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.Yes. Now, will you let me go to Chicago?That's all right. What are you going to do about Emily?You want love on your own terms, don't you, Charlie - Love according to your own rules. And if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt!I know you will.No. I wish you'd go home to Emily. She'll be pretty upset by all this - She still loves you -Yes.I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie. We'll let the salary stay where it is.Emily -Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -I'm glad to see you.Almost two to one -Emily!Emily, you're being - a little unfair - You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -know that, Emily -Emily, you -It's - all over -He's paying for it, Emily. Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically - - socially, everywhere, I guess. don't know about the papers, but -Hello, Bernstein.Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!Kane? Charlie? Where is he?I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.Hello, Charlie -Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills. Hey, nurse! Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South - - you know. Shangri-la? El Dorado? Sloppy Joe's? What's the name of that place? You know... All right. Xanadu. I knew what it was all the time. You caught on, didn't you?I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think. Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have. I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years. He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything. Of course, he built it for her -I don't know. He was disappointed in the world. So he built one of his own - An absolute monarchy - It was something bigger than an opera house anyway - Nurse! Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?Hey, Nurse!I'm ready to go in now. You know when I was a young man, there was an impression around that nurses were pretty. It was no truer then than it is now.All right, all right. You won't forget, will you, about the cigars? And tell them to wrap them up to look like toothpaste, or something, or they'll stop them at the desk.
