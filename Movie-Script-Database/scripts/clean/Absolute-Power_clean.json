{"Absolute-Power": {"LUTHER": {"raw_line": "I never do.Redhead.My only failing.Bad night.Kate. Kate.Probably too late for me to take it up.The jogging.Dumb way to start this, I guess.Wanted to talk to you.Believe it or not, the weather. Nights are starting to get cold.I was thinking of maybe relocating. Someplace with a kinder climate. I just wanted to check it out with you first... ... you're the only family I've got.Kate --This move -- I'm talking permanent, you understand.-- no ---- no --You mean I've got a weak face. Thanks, Val.Four should cover it.They're good. Beards and mustaches, too.It may come to that.Europe's fine. Maybe the Caribbean for winters. When can I pick up?Thanks, Val. I've always been able to count on you.What?Finish it.Five years doesn't sound so bad to me just now.Boy, you must be smart.Usually takes a week for you guys to get to me. You look just like your picture, Seth. I'm Luther Whitney.So, do you want my confession now or after coffee?Watched the Bullets game with Red Bransford. Prison buddy of mine -- runs a bar -- want to question me about the game? I'm probably lying.I love true crime --I wish it was true. Your robber actually went in the front door but came out down a rope in the dark in the middle of the night? If only I could do stuff like that -- I'd be the star of my A.A.R.P. meetings.You want me to help solve your case?Older fella. Like me.Need patience. The secret is just research, research, research -- from everything I've read.Well, from what I can tell on the tube, it's not a small house. There had to be an architect, right? You'd be able to tell which one from public records in the library. And once you know the office, you could break in and find the plans and Xerox them, get them back before morning.Seth -- breaking in isn't hard -- what's hard is breaking in so no one knows you've been there. Now, after the architect, next you'd want the contractor's office -- and the security company's office. You know the skill involved breaking the security of a security company? I wonder how those guys do it?Papers said he kept the money in a vault, yes? Well, I'm guessing there was probably some secret way to open it ---- explain ---- amazing -- -- must have been a lot of money inside.The way you said it -- as if you were trying to surprise me.There you go.Seth, you've got to get with the program you expect to catch this guy -- most likely it is a guy, am I right? Some kind of weird loner?I'm the perfect prototype. But you see any face often enough, you'll start putting things together. That's why these top guys disguise themselves. I read a great article a couple of years back -- damn, I wish I could remember where -- anyway, it was about these makeup experts some of them use -- wigmakers, people like that.I'd love that but I'm late as it is -- got to get my pacemaker checked. -- all this excitement, you understand.Tomorrow is promised to no one.Not 'til morning? -- I'll be by early --Katie darling, you've gotta try real food sometime.Turn that off, okay?Put it back on.Do it --You -- heartless -- prick -- -- you -- fucking -- bastard --I'm not running -- not from you. I'm going to bring you down...This guy sure has the guts of a burglar. Wish we had him.I need to look really good today.You got that right.I did not kill that woman, Kate.You're not the first.You have to know I'm not a murderer.My daughter wanted to see me.The robbery went fine 'til they came in. They were drunk. I hid in the vault. Sex got rough. He was going to kill Christy, but she turned the tables, was going to kill him. Two guys came in, shot her dead.Probably only one of them. I think Walter Sullivan might have hired the other.Not as powerful as the President of the United States.Richmond was drunk. The two guys are Secret Service. Chief of Staff Russell planned the coverup.Every word true.Because I swear on Mattie's grave.On your mother's grave, Kate -- you know I'd kill myself before I'd lie about that.I know.I know.I was set to. At the airport. All the money I'd ever need.But I saw that bastard using * Sullivan on the T.V. -- maybe I couldn't have saved that woman, Kate. But I didn't even try. I know what you think of me and I know what we've been to each other -- -- haven't been to each other. And it's not the time to try and explain my life ---- but I've never robbed anyone couldn't afford it and I've never stiffed a waitress. And Alan Richmond has to pay.Not much, maybe -- but I only went to jail when I had partners. People betray each other, Kate -- nowadays, when there's a group, someone wants to write a book ---- these people hate each other. And if I can drive them just a little bit nuts, who knows how they'll react under pressure? Glad for the talk, wish we'd had more.This is probably it; you understand that. I was never going to tell you this, but I watched you argue a case last year -- thank God you got your brains from your mother.It always is -- -- and I may not make you proud, Kate -- -- but I'm not going down alone...I trust you.Kate okay?I'm not staying on long enough for you to track this, just answer me.... Kate...?Scream. Go on. Which do you want most, for me to kill you or life in jail forever?Going to guess this wasn't to pep her up.... why do you think that...?That's because you didn't know your crime, prick.I didn't mind you tried to shoot me at the restaurant -- I wouldn't have minded if you'd nailed me at Sullivan's -- part of the job -- -- but you fucked with blood.I'm fresh out.... go to sleep, honey...I need one answer -- when you interviewed Walter Sullivan, did he say why Christy didn't go to Barbados?So will you -- check your phones --Luther, sir.I know the way, sir -- I'm the man who robbed you ---- and you're the man who tried to have me killed --You want to believe that, don't you? -- Makes your life a lot simpler if you believe that, isn't that right? What do you think I gain being here?I don't need your money, Mr. Sullivan. Look in your vault lately?Shit's coming down tonight, Mr. Sullivan, do you want to be a player or not? Do you want to know what happened, or not? I saw. Your call.Are you up to hearing about it? -- Do you want to hear how he beat the shit out of her and tried to strangle her -- you have enough left for that? --I was in the chair when they came in. They were drunk -- at first he only wanted to bruise her -- she fought back, he went for the kill -- she turned the tables. Then he screamed for help.Secret Service shot her.Gloria Russell handled the cover up.-- don't you want to know who the man was?We're too old to bullshit each other, Mr. Sullivan.You know!You fucking well do, don't shake your head at me -- when you're alone at night, when the rage takes you and you think of what you'd do to revenge her, on those nights you put a face to your enemy.-- we're going all the way, Walter --It sure is.The press conference -- remember? -- he held you in his arms and said if only Christy hadn't gotten sick she would have been with you * in Barbados -- *-- how do you think he knew she was sick? You didn't tell anybody. But he heard it, all right. He heard it from her. That night. And I heard every word --And this?I did steal it. But that isn't my blood and those aren't my prints.Haven't budged.He was just checking in. When you're up to it, he said we might come over for dinner.

Why?A strong burglar with a weak mind -- obviously another open and shut case...Mr. Sullivan? -- I'm Seth Frank, senior homicide detective for Middleton County --I have to ask some questions, but it can be tomorrow.You'd been in Barbados for two days?But Mrs. Sullivan didn't come.I have to ask about the vault.Yessir, I do.I think someone sat in it -- and I think that someone may have been involved in the murder. You were my father's hero, Mr. Sullivan, I promise you this won't make my highlight reel.I understand, sir; I'll do what I can.See if any of this makes sense.I am Christy Sullivan and I walk in and surprise a burglar.Gold star. I draw my gun --That's nothing -- why do I bother to have her strip and then put her clothes back on?And I dress her because?She had a point-21 blood alcohol level. -- she was too drunk to drive. I've checked every cab and limo company in the area and not one of them knows anything. Someone drove her home. Goddamit, who? And why haven't they come forward?You saying the burglar drove her home? I hate this case.Good service, thanks.Oh yeah -- remember that bullet hole in the wall? Had the lab dig out the slug -- guess what -- no slug -- why does the burglar take the time to do that?Oh I like that a lot -- two different guns means two different burglars. Two guys broke in? And they both went out the window? Bullshit. And oh, by the way, why does he -- or they -- go out the window in the first place when he -- or they -- got in by breaking a zillion- dollar security system? --What?Here, you solve the goddam thing. Did I mention that I hate this case? I really truly hate this case -- you cannot imagine how much I hate it ---- hi, Seth Frank --What did you have in mind?Still trying to figure out what might have happened --You Secret Service guys do that?You're that Bill Burton.Luther Whitney -- -- one of the great thieves of the world.Been going nuts with this thing, up all night and I remembered your notion how it might be two burglars, and around dawn I thought, wait, what if it wasn't two burglars but what if it was one guy trying to throw us off by making it look like two? Called a buddy at the Bureau -- they keep track of this stuff internationally -- he says maybe only a half a dozen guys alive could have pulled off the Sullivan job -- I'm tracing all six -- -- but Whitney's the only one lives in Washington.Because he hasn't been arrested in thirty years.Ancient history -- he wasn't a jewel thief back then. Just a kid, just part of a gang, a three- time loser. But since he got out the last time, he's only worked alone ---- and no one's touched him. He gets questioned whenever anything big comes up. But nothing sticks.Whitney hasn't killed anyone in 45 years.Korea.Not just a veteran -- a wounded veteran. Got his combat record here. Battles, commendations, * decorations up the kazoo. * Lives alone on his disability. * Says he does anyway. * * And I don't do war heroes... *Sorry?Before I send you away for life, I should probably check out your alibi.You been following the case?-- F.B.I. feels only a few guys could have handled something as hard as the Sullivan job. I've got a list here; you're on it.Luther? Why was this so hard?Just looking for insight. How would you -- scratch that -- how would one go about it? What kind of person do you think I should be looking for?Because?Research for what?Not just steal them?Why go to all that trouble?-- clicker ---- gizmo -- looked like a V.C.R. remote --Five million.Why's that funny?I was trying to surprise you.Would the burglar use a disguise?Maybe like you.Go on about the wigmakers.A) You don't have a pacemaker, and B) I'll be back tomorrow.For a tough prosecutor, you don't resemble your reputation, Miss Whitney.What would you do if I just turned around and left?You're exactly like your reputation, Miss Whitney --I'm assuming your father's a big part of you ---- You think it's all coincidence? He's a thief and you just happen to be the toughest prosecutor in the area?-- Luther disappeared.I think you can help me.When?Any idea where he might have gone?You saying he's left town, skipped the country, what?-- where? ---- Then where'd you hear this?And?-- Lady, I may be an asshole cop but you don't know me well enough to call me one --Years.Strange place for a thief to leave a key, don't you think?He sure took off in a hurry. What scares a professional thief like that?You can do a good thing, Kate -- -- help me bring him in. Just leave a message on his phone machine, you're worried about him.It's the truth -- you are worried about him -- this isn't your normal case -- his life may be in danger -- you can save him, make the call --Of course he'll come. You're all he has.Kate, he's on the run and he's scared and he's right to be scared because he's going to get caught -- you don't know the heat on this. *Where?Figured he'd like an eyewitness report of the capture. This is our guy -- if he's innocent, he sure took off awful fast.Fuck...This is not part of my brilliant master plan.I like that in a woman.Top number's local police -- -- other two are my office and home. I live alone, too, call anytime. Want me to get someone to spend the night?I've got surveillance outside. And I'm keeping it on 'til this is over. I've got a feeling he's going to try and contact you.Listen, I'm sorry.Anything unusual, call me right away -- not a bother, I live alone.Feeble, huh?Deal.Pelligrino would be great. What's funny, I say it wrong?I don't think I've told you this, but I live alone. Lock it behind me.Real good. Try and sleep.Where are you?She couldn't be in better hands -- talk about catching a break, Secret Service called me. They're taking over surveillance --Just that she changed her mind.
