Nice to meet you...Where do you want me to put them?I'm okay.Sure...No, I been here a while.Here and there...What's he do?I'm sorry.I drive.No, for the movies...It's just part-time. Most days I work in a garage.Reseda Boulevard.He interested in that kind of stuff?I should get going...Thank you for the drink...I'm not interested...Hi...You think?Okay. Get in the car...Your mom said you like movies?Ever see the Terminator?Grease?Wanna see where it was shot?I'm glad...Don't worry...You need a ride anywhere over the weekend I'm not doing much...I can't make Friday.I told Irene I'd drive her to Burbank.You're taking a long time to fix her car...What's happening now?Looks like he's in trouble.I'm gonna show you another trick...This is pretty complicated. You watching?Think you can remember that?...Hello...It's a short cut...You okay?...That's great...Don't worry. I won't complain.I'm glad.He's a great kid.Yeah.I get by.I've got some things to do.Soon.I hope so...Don't worry about it.Call it fifty.You can't have both.Something like that Buick over there'll cost you nine grand but there isn't much point in a city where you can't drive faster than sixty five.I wouldn't know.Excuse me.Irene's husband.Hi...You look pretty busy yourself...I already ate. I just wanted to see how you were?I'd like that...Can you move?He's right here...Fucking punks didn't look like they needed to...Why?How much?Is that why you need a car?I didn't.Why don't you take them away?You okay?You want something to drink?What have you got there?...Who gave you that?...Not if we understand each other.I drive. That's all I do.You tell me where we start, where we're headed, where we'll be going afterwards. I don't take part, I don't carry weapons, I drive...We do this job he's paid his debt. You leave him and his family alone...Thanks...Fine...Don't worry...You don't have to do this.It's not too late...You got five minutes...How much did Cook tell you you could expect to net?Stay here. Don't answer the door...Benicio?...Is your mom there?...Tell her I'll call later...The guy saw you grab the money and jump in the car -- why didn't he say anything?Any idea there'd be another car waiting?You just got a little kid's father killed. You think I won't hurt you?You were gonna rip us off and split the take?How long have you known him?You know his real name?You're going to take me to him right now, you understand?It's safe.Two guys just tried to kill me for it. I want to find out who it belongs to first...Maybe Chris. Probably not...Cook moved office again?Should've figured you for a shill. Who were you fronting for?Whose money am I holding?Who's money am I holding?I could, but your boss won't be happy when he finds out you've kept him waiting...I have something that belongs to him.A million dollars...Seems that way...I'm not selling. I give you a time and place, you come collect your stuff...Just that. Out of it. You put a muzzle on Cook, forget your zombies at the Motel, forget we ever had this conversation...I don't have partners...Just you...This isn't what I do. I'll call again with instructions...You got a minute?...I know...Hey...I'm sorry about your father...Can I give you a ride?Then let me walk you down...He was into one of the prison gangs for a lot of money. He was trying to protect you.I still have the money. Whatever you need -He didn't talk me into anything. I've been doing this my whole life. It's what I do...Parking lot, please...I'm leaving. I want you to come with me...You and Benicio...You will. Once I straighten out this thing I'm getting out for good. We'll go some place. Anywhere you want.Why not?...Nino's guys came after me. How did they know about Irene?It's too late...They're gonna come after you to find me. You have to leave...Doesn't have to...I never asked for any of it.That's up to you.She's not interested.Sounds like we have a problem...What do you suggest I do?Nine, ten thousand. If you can find one that still runs.It's me...You got a pen? I need you to write something down......JJT 108...It's the license number for my car. I've left it in a parking lot on the corner of Culver and Lincoln. Section M 10...It's yours.

Why would you want to change now?How much do you need?That sounds like a lot.I don't know anything about car racing but I assume there's a reason for that?`Millions'?Thank you, Ron. You sure you don't want any of this?You still haven't given me a number?Come on, Shannon. How can you be sure? What have you got these big money teams don't have?And they got half a dozen Drivers you told me.But you don't have the money.And what happens to my money if this kid gets hit by a bus?What's a Jew doing running a Pizzeria? Worst fucking pizza in LA by the way. How hard is it to bake a loaf of bread?I thought you were supposed to be out of town anyway?Be polite, Nino. I invited him here.I'll think about it but I want to meet your guy first...Looks like a chocolate bar. You're gonna have to tell me if that's fast or slow `cause I got no idea...Don't worry. So are mine...You too...I'll give you three for seventy percent...I paid for it. Out of my own pocket. Anyway, that's just the shell. You start with the shell, then you build the frame, then the motor. I paid three hundred for that. The money goes on the inside not the outside.You buy it. Shannon sell him the car...So, when's our first race?You gonna be ready?Cautious man. Like myself. Don't wanna make promises you can't keep...He ever tell you how we met?I did some producing back in the 80's. Interesting pictures. Kind of European. Shannon arranged the cars for us and did all the stunts. I knew he was overcharging me but I loved having him around. His next business venture he tried the same thing with some of Nino's friends they broke his spine. He never had much luck...We're talking...The reason I'm telling you this is because he's got a lot invested in you. So do I...Anything you need just let me know...Can you for once say something without the word fuck in it?You want some coffee?They've been going at it ever since they moved in. She's such a nice lady but it's a lousy Shidach. It's a wonder they haven't killed each other... So, what's your interest in the Seventh Heaven?It's a strip joint on La Cienega. Your friend Cook runs it. Why're you curious about him all of a sudden?Yeah, I know him. He's a crazy Albanian. If I were your friend I'd pay up.You wake me up this early this friend must be a close friend?How's our car by the way?And our driver?That's what you should worry about...You want my advice? Let your friend work it out for himself. Don't take pills for other people's headaches... You got twenty minutes? I need you to run down to the market and get me some milk......I already gave you my advice. You should have taken your money and left this guy alone.Not now that it's bounced up in your face.You like taking orders, go shut the blinds.Sun's in my eyes...You stole from the East Coast mob?And where did this punk find a million dollars? You ever consider he may have consulted some higher-ups? You even bother to check? -Your city? This is a big city, pal, and last time I checked we were partners! -Then why the fuck didn't you come to me before you set up your dummy robbery or hired this fucking amateur?!...Well, now you fucked up I am involved. Anyone finds out you stole from the family they'll kill both of us -Those old men gave us the funds to move out here.The money always flows up, Izzy. You know that.What about this prick?Are you asking my permission?It's not about the money...All right...Pass the salt...Your turn to clean up after me...All these priceless cars, you should get better locks...Going somewhere?I'm looking for your driver.It's bad luck. Two thousand heists in this city a year, he had to pick the wrong one.Picked the wrong guy for that too. My partner's a belligerent asshole with his back against the wall...Right now so am I. I don't take care of this I'm in big trouble...Any idea where he is?He just walked out on you after everything you've done for him, took all the money?I ever tell you how long Izzy and I been friends? Since we were six. Only Jews in a neighborhood of wops. Long as I can remember he was getting me into trouble and I was getting him out of scrapes...Anyone else I'd take your side...What's this fucking kid to you anyway?I leave here without finding out where he is, there'll be others coming after me. I guarantee they'll be too stupid to figure out you won't talk and drag this out unnecessarily...You know, it's too bad, I was getting excited about our race team, having my name all over the car. I think we could have made something of this business...You won't feel a thing. Close your eyes and you'll fall asleep...Bernie Rose, next apartment over -I heard...You all right, Shonda?What's your fucking name?I'm a patient man, Lenny, not much for getting in other people's way. What I figure is, we've all got our own lives, right? And the right to be left alone? So I sit next door for almost a year now listening to what goes down in here and I keep thinking, hey, they'll work it out. You gonna work it out, Lenny?You're lucky to have her, lucky she's put up with you this long. Lucky I've put up with you. She has good reason: she loves you. I don't have any reason at all. So stop raising your voice or fucking move...Yeah?...How many times I heard that before... 9/24/10Nino?Looks like me, you and your girlfriend are the only pieces left on the board...I'd say this has gone far enough. See any reason why it should go on?...Then we should talk. You know a place called the Great Wall -- out on Sherman Way?Care for a glass?...I can recommend the duck. Hell, I can recommend everything -- Walnut prawns, shredded beef, Velvet chicken -- but the duck's to die for...The duck, please. For two.No, thanks...You've been on a roll. Cut yourself quite a swath out there.We usually don't. But it comes down on our heads regardless. Look at Shannon...Anyway it's water under the bridge now. Question is where does that leave us?You bring the cash?Tell me something, how does someone with no interest in money get mixed up in a heist? Shannon told me it was because of the girl?Don't worry. Nobody else knows about her. Just me... You still see her?...She's got her head screwed on right. I got two ex-wives, three kids, four grandchildren. Not one of them speaks to me now...This is what I'll do for you. You give me the money, nobody knows she exists. But it's a different matter with you.And just when we were getting to know each other......We shake hands, say goodbye, it's the start of your new life. Sooner or later they'll come after you. No end to it. Someone gets tired, somebody else takes their place. It goes on and on. Whatever dreams you have, whatever plans, you might as well forget `em, because this is what it's gonna be like till the day you die... I just thought you should know...First time I heard about you, Shannon told me you drove. Fast. That's a start...Either that or you choke on the duck...How much does something like this cost?Maybe I'll take yours.
