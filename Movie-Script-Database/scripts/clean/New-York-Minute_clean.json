{"New-York-Minute": {"PARKER": {"raw_line": "Morning. Startled, Drew shoots herself in the eye with the water pick. Parker's ENTERED from her side. Drew shuts off the water pick, dries her face.Why the young executive look?And she never will. At least until after I'm married.Like hell. Drew shivers.Hellooo, Warren. Distracted, Parker drops her toothbrush, which bounces off the counter and PLOPS into the toilet. ON THE TOILET BOWL -- there it is, slowly sinking. Parker is stone-faced. She looks to her sister's side of the counter where a fresh brush sits in the flowered holder. She's considering... she's reaching... then... nah. Instead, she squeezes the tube straight into her mouth, brushes with a finger and spits.Boys can be fun. You should try one some time.We'll take that as a yes.I still don't understand why you want to finish college in two years? What's the big hurry?Football games I get. But partying? A waste of time? Parker looks to her dad. He shrugs.If you want to have fun, I'm the one who should go, not Mother Teresa over there. Drew is still choking -- pretty badly.Let me know if you want me to do the Heimlich. It'd be cool to have you owe me your life. WHOOSH! The granola goes down and she sucks air.Don't be sad, Mom. Just think, when Drew leaves for school, you won't be losing a daughter, you'll be losing an anal-retentive social misfit who will be voted most likely to die a virgin. Drew throws an arm around Quinn's other shoulder.It's not fair you guys get to go into the City and I don't.Chemistry? Please. Name one time you ever used chemistry in your life.You're a doctor, Mom. I'm not going to be a doctor. I can't even say the word 'orifice,' let alone put a finger up one. The BEEP BEEP of Drew's alarm WATCH signals time to go. Drew is trying to cover up, but she's reeling from the news that her mother's going to accompany her.Good luck with your interview. Drew pauses, holding the door open.Oh, I'm interested in chemistry. Just not the kind with all the numbers and stinky test tubes. Drew shuts the door and hustles off into the train station. Parker SIGHS, looks to the BLACKBERRY on the seat next to her.Ah, chemistry.Looking for a seat.You know, I just got this itch.I couldn't concentrate anyway. I'm too... distracted today.No! It's about spontaneity, which you obviously wouldn't know anything about.Pathetic? You want to talk about pathetic?! At least I don't count getting accidentally felt up in dodge ball as my first date!You're going to be eighteen and you've never even HAD a boyfriend! The EXECUTIVE furrows his brow at Drew -- never?Uh, Drew? Do you have any money? I don't have enough for a ticket. Drew just rolls her eyes and turns her back on her sister. The Executive peers over his spectacles at Parker with the old paternal reprimand look.Please. Like you never ditched school. CUT TO:'You don't know how you met me...' But when she spots the CONDUCTOR ENTERING the front of the car, she abruptly stops, slips down in he seat and slides past the COMMUTER LADY next to her into the aisle.Excuse me. Parker heads the opposite direction from the ticket- taking Conductor and out the back of the train car.Why don't I save the b.s. story and just ask you to cut me a break this one time because I know you've got a big heart and you remember what it was like when you were young and... and... ... randy?I guess you were never young and randy! This is when she sees Drew sitting in the train window, smiling and giving her a little victory wave.You get kicked off, too? Why didn't you just buy a ticket? Parker stoops to help collect a couple of things but Drew, mad at hell, swats her hand away.What happened to your head?Sorry.I am! Where are you going?I already -- But Drew's inside the stationhouse.-- did. They said something about a delay. Parker follows into the stationhouse.Come on. Hurry. I got us a ride.A car service.Good morning. Thank you. My sister's coming, too. Drew KNOWS SOME SKETCHY SHIT IS GOING DOWN buy she's only got this instant to consider. She glances at the STRANDED MOB descending on a lone approaching CAB, engulfing it.You want to make that interview, or not? Drew lets herself be pulled inside. Bennie shuts the door and waddles around to his side.You know, Mister... She checks his Chauffeur's License up front: Benjamin Loyola.... Loyola.Mr. Bennie? We have a slight change of itinerary. We need to go into Manhattan. 57th and 5th will be fine. Bennie doesn't seem perturbed a bit.Barneys.We've got five hours. Relax. He FIRES UP the LINCOLN and off they go. Drew now has a pretty clear inclination as to what's going on. She leans into her sister and WHISPERS.So? Just then, Bennie tosses the sign, which he'd stashed on the dash, onto the seat next to him, face up so Drew can read:Northern Italian.What? You need to get to that interview. We now have a ride. We will pay for the ride. End of big deal. This is when Bennie's CELL PHONE RINGS and he answers it.Not good.I agree. How about... NOW! Just as Bennie brakes for the light, Parker throws her door open and pulls Drew into the street! An ONCOMING BUICK LOCKS UP its BRAKES as they dash for the sidewalk.He's stuck at the light! VRROOOM! Here comes the Lincoln storming around the corner.We lost him. Wow. That was a rush.I don't have any change, but here. Parker starts to find the Homeless Guy a dollar but Drew reaches over to stop her...Ew. That stinks. That's not just Slushee. The MINI-MART CLERK approaches them, shaking his head.May we use your bathroom please? The cherry syrup and cheap wine concoction drips down Drew's blank face.That's what I keep telling her.Everything's going to be fine. Peek-a-boo!We're practically there. We'll get you cleaned up, you'll get into the program and... Peek-a-boo! ... we'll both look back on this and laugh our butts off. BLECCH! The BABY PUKES all over Drew. She looks sideways at her sister.See? New York. We made it.Listen. I've got an idea.Come on! We're going to the Plaza! We can be Eloise! We'll get a nice room, you can take a shower and I'll swap clothes with you! Simple as that!So? You've got the emergency credit card Mom gave you, right? Drew's suddenly looking at her EMPTY HANDS.What's wrong?Where's your, uh, stuff?Oh.Come on, Drew. I don't think even the Mafia kills people just for scamming a ride. Quit being paranoid. So, we don't do the Plaza. I've got... Parker digs in her pockets.Six dollars and thirty-two cents.What are we thinking? You've got your secret-safety twenty!That's not important now. But let's just say that it's a good thing for you I think those shoes are so ugly I never borrowed them. Hey, how about there? Parker points to hotel where the dilapidated sign reads: THE RITZY PLAZA -- HOURLY RATES, HOT TUBS.Twenty-six dollars and thirty-six cents.Hello? Anybody?We need a room... with a shower. Just for an hour. There's the sound of something SCRAPING across the floor and then the MIDGET HOTEL CLERK appears behind the counter. Now he's standing on a STOOL and we don't know what he was doing behind the counter.Hi.-- really nice place. How much for half an hour.We've only got twenty-five.No, not at all.Sir, that's every last cent we have in the world. I swear to you, we aren't planning to steal your key.I promise we won't tell anyone. Will we, Drew?Drew?! DREW?! Parker follows her.Drew! STOP! CUT TO:Man, that little guy could really motor. Why'd you bolt?That was all our money.Key down, you're going to have an attack.You know how I told you not to be paranoid?What I meant was, it isn't paranoia if someone really is chasing you. Parker tries to subtly indicate with her eyes that Drew should look across the street.It's him.Quiet. Don't run. He'll see us. Not wanting to draw his attention, the Girls shuffle off quickly down the street. ON Bennie -- squinting across at them. Can he make them out in the crowd? He nods to ANOTHER DRIVER, tosses his coffee cup and climbs in behind the wheel.Maybe it's just coincidence!Come on! Parker leads her into traffic, HORNS BLARING, as they weave their way across. On the far side, a HORSE CARRIAGE pulls away from the curb and at the last minute, Parker spots a fresh pile of... ... HORSE SHIT, which she manages to leap. Drew, however, ISN'T GOING TO MAKE IT OVER. She closes her eyes.Jump! Drew stumbles, wrong-foots the takeoff but somehow manages to get across it to the curb. For just a BEAT, we see her surprised face. Hm. I did it. Then they see Bennie crossing in traffic, huffing and puffing after them and not seeing the pile, which he hits in full stride, slips on, and PLOPS INTO on his ass. This gives the girls the opening they need and they ditch inside some revolving doors.Well, Cinderella, your wish has come true. Voila, La Plaza, mademoiselle.Yeah. I've got what I'd like to call a 'creative solution' to that.What good will that do?Have her what? Hi, Mom? Could you leave that baby halfway outta there and drive into the city?Dad, hey. Drew. Complete loser. Couldn't get to an interview by myself, need full bail out. Yeah. I'm the one who was going to change the world, I just couldn't get across town.When you ask a question like that, the person is going to look. Drew drags her behind a palm. Sure enough, across the lobby, a guy dressed as PLAINCLOTHES HOTEL SECURITY now pretends he wasn't keeping an eye on them.Drew, we haven't done anything.Let's go. The girls slip into the elevator. When it closes, Morty's watching.We're getting you a shower. Blake Greer pulled this at the Sheraton after the prom.We're not going to steal anything. We're just going to sneak in, use a little soap and water and get out.We're not going to break anything. We are going to enter, however.Shhh... here comes somebody. DOWN THE HALL a door swings open and MR. AND MRS. LO BIANCHO, wealthy Bostonians, EXIT their suite.Hurry up!I didn't want to have to do this, but... look in the mirror behind you. ON DREW -- bracing herself, she turns slowly. CUT TO:Housekeeping? CUT TO:Drew, you're not a criminal. You just smell like one. This way.A dog?Key down. I'll take him in the living room and keep a lookout. You just get in that shower. Parker approaches The Emperor.Hi, little guy. You don't look so tough, huh? You don't look much like a dog, actually. More like Woody Woodpecker. Happy to give the company, The Emperor practically jumps into Parker's arms.You're cute, aren't you, in a freakazoidal kinda way. She takes him into the living room and moves to the door.Was your daddy a rat? Is that it? Well, I still like you. Parker, holding The Emperor, opens the door a crack to keep a lookout.Bad ratdog! She chases him down the hallway and then around the corner where they have to dodge cans of paints, a ladder, until finally The Emperor slides on some plastic sheeting, careens into a can of mauve paint and isWow. Thank you.That's not your dog! Hey!Somebody took the dog! They reach the end of the hallway and are TRAPPED. Only one out. Parker HUFFS OPEN the window to the fire escape and they climb out...Hurry up! But DREW'S FROZEN WITH FEAR and to complicate matters, she's struggling to keep the curtain wrapped around herself.Are you out of your mind?! It's only a little ways! JUMP!Yes you can!Have fun in prison. Under 'Summer Internships' on your college application, you can write 'license plate manufacturing.'A painter took it!Hey, complete stranger! Get off my sister! Parker yanks Drew from underneath Dream Guy.The hotel guy's here. The juxtaposition of the TWO POLAR OPPOSITE OUTFITS draped over twins suddenly throws the audience into PAROXYSMS OF APPRECIATION for the inspiration of the artist and they call him out! Bobo! BOBO! AUTEUR!And the police. Bobo presses himself between the girls, taking their hands and beginning his bows, but the girls spot Morty peeking from backstage, and they TAKE OFF, leaping off the front of the stage into the audience like punks jumping into the mosh pit.Is this what they call 'returning to the scene of the crime'? Unfortunately for them, to get to the front door they have to pass by... ... the PLAZA MANAGER and the other HOUSE SECURITY AGENT, BRUCE , consoling Mrs. Lo Biancho. When MORTY and the COPS come through the doors behind them, however, there's no choice. The girls try to look as inconspicuous as possible heading for the revolving doors but they overhear:A painter did.Of course he's right. We're going to march in there and give ourselves up right this minute. They will, of course, take us down to the precinct, call Mom and Dad, we'll give our statement, they'll grill us under hot lights for a few hours, force us to confess with some tricky good cop/bad cop routine and the next thing you know we're doing five to ten in Attica. Drew checks her watch.Sure.Oh my God. Warren works in the city.Knock it off, Drew! This guy might be able to help. He lives here.So. We're going to the United Nations to use the restroom.Look, he said he'd help and it's only a couple blocks away. You got a better idea? Speedy opens the rear door of the newsstand.Thank you, Mr. Speedy.We're going to make it, Drew. You'll see. There's still plenty of time. You'll get cleaned up, we can trade clothes... this is a nice suit, huh? Right?You're going to get accepted, then we can explain the misunderstanding about the dog to the police and everything will be okay.First things first.My fault? MY FAULT?! I didn't mean for any of this to happen!What's that supposed to mean?Bernie Lipscomb? You...? Drew didn't want to admit that -- it just slipped out under pressure.You liked Bernie, too?No I didn't. I haven't seen you talk to a guy since we were in kindergarten and we thought Jerry Wester was a girl.I did not! Wow, the really spooky thing is, that would mean we liked the same guy. A block away, the United Nations building stands majestically against the sky.No. At the head of the group, the U.N. TOUR GUARD, geeky in a Clark Kent way and nice enough looking but definitely not a male model, leans into a petite BRUNETTE and her LITTLEWarren? Does anyone know Warren Collier?Gee, Warren. Isn't that strange? I didn't recognize you from your picture.Do you have an office or someplace private we could go?It's important.Are you a lying sack, or what?That's not the point.I guess.This is my sister, Drew.That's a joke.Police, for one thing.It's the kind of joke that will be a lot funnier a few years from now.I don't see 'em.Thank you. Maybe we should get out of this sack. CUT TO:How are we going to find Drew?You speak Japanese?We don't have any money!Follow that... uh...Oh, yeah. JUST GO! The TAXI pulls away from the curb.Excuse me, what were you doing?You're the one all 'I gotta get to this interview or I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown' and yet you have time to address the United Nations?Not now, Warren.I told you, I didn't know you liked him! It was no big deal!How could I know? You never tell me anything!What's that supposed to mean?Big mouth?! Ooh, I hope you miss that stupid interview!What?You screwed up what?You're Drew. Drew doesn't screw ANYTHING up, let alone scheduling. You're the Iron Chef of scheduling.How?And then what? Earthquake? Tsunami? Nuclear winter?Forgot?So today? All this? What are you doing?You were just going to jump him?Drew?! Drew, get back in this taxi! Parker starts to open her door on the TRAFFIC SIDE! HONK HONK! It's nearly SHEARED OFF by a passing truck and she closes it just in time.Gee, you really are a genius. As the taxi bogs down in traffic, Drew disappears around the corner up ahead.Talk about spontaneous.Where'd she go?Follow my sister.Stay flexible, will you please? They turn right.It can't be. She's terrified of dogs.She's faster than she looks. CUT TO:We have to go to the jail and tell them what happened.Poor Drew. She wanted to get into that program more than anything in the world. With a SIGH, they turn to go and BUMP -- knock into Bennie, who's staring coldly down at Parker.Oh my God! Please don't kill me!We don't know anything at all! We didn't see anything or hear anything and I'll swear to that in a court of law! Bennie appears unmoved. Parker closes her eyes, trying to meet death with dignity.Just not in the face.Nut bags? No. I mean, yes. Is there a right answer to that? See, my sister had this interview which turned out not to be an interview, really and I sort of messed things up because I wanted to meet him. Indicating Warren.Not now, Warren. Drew was going to be late even though technically she wasn't going to be late since there wasn't an interview and that's when we got in your car. I promise we meant to pay. It was a true emergency.You were just...?Thank you?What time is it? CUT TO:Try to keep up, Warren!This is no good. I don't do too well with the whole rehearsal thing. I'm more of a 'wing it' person. Parker checks herself in her reflection in the glass. Working herself into Drew form, she puts her hair into a conservative bun and then tries straightening her posture.How's this look? Drewish?Warren, honesty is fine. But you could edit a little, you know?Wish me luck.I'm here to see Professor Spaulding.Um, no. However...Professor Spaulding?May I have a moment of your time?I know. But this is very important.Life and death, if you must know. The Professor hesitates for just an instant, giving Parker her opening. She grabs his hand, giving it a vigorous, Young Republican shake.I'm Drew MacLeod.Trust me.I promise you, though my missing the deadline seems to suggest otherwise, my studies would never suffer on account of my being unorganized. This was, and I think anyone who knows me would vouch for this, a complete anomaly.I was so thrown when my sister asked Bernard to the dance that I simply failed to post the schedule request and seeing it already checked off on my to-do list, I over-looked it until after the deadline had passed.No. Not at all. This program is my number one priority.Hi, Parker.Oh, the Professor and I have had a wonderful talk about how important this program is to me and how it was my sister, Drew, who screwed things up.When I saw them take you to jail...... I didn't think you'd make it. I knew I wouldn't be any good at it, but I figured at least there was a chance.You're not mad?I'm so sorry for today.Thank you.Okay, I considered. What I want to say is, I didn't purposefully set out to ruin your day, but that doesn't mean I'm not a little... jealous.I'm not like you. I don't have your intensity, your focus, your...I just mean, maybe, even if I don't intend to, maybe that jealousy, you know, gets in the way sometimes.I don't know if I'd get that technical about it. But yeah.You're welcome. Aren't you going to confess now?How you're secretly jealous of me?Oh, let me see. Because I don't have a stick up my butt? Because I know how to have fun? Because I'm spontaneous and creative and men are all my love slaves? Drew stops, ponders this deeply.Sis?Gotta go. Parker grabs Warren by the hand and blasts around the corner just as... Charley MacLeod pulls up in his truck and parks half on, half off the curb. He leans over, waving to Drew.Oh, man. I'm doomed. I'll never get home before them.Warren, something tells me you're spoiled!We, uh, don't think you're naive, Mom.So? Open it. There's a HONK.Come on!", "clean_line": "morning startled drew shoots eye water pick parker entered drew shuts water pick dries face young executive look married like hell drew shivers hellooo warren

come"}, "DREW": {"raw_line": "I have my interview at NYU today. Parker, sleepy, stretches, unaware she's exposing her new belly ring.No way Mom knows about that. Self-consciously, Parker drops her arms, pulls her shirt down.Didn't it hurt?Piercings are so... unhygienic. A little BEEP BEEP from her preset WATCH ALARM goes off.Breakfast. Drew turns on her heel and EXITS. When Parker sets her Blackberry down we get our first glimpse of... ... HER SIDE OF THE BATHROOM which resembles a post- apocalyptic toiletry landscape. There's a very clear line of demarcation on the counter like the demilitarized zone separating the Koreas. Parker reaches among the rubble for her toothbrush but notices another message on her Blackberry: THOREAU 786: KNOW WHAT TODAY IS? NOTATWIN: ANOTHER DAY IN HELL? THOREAU 786: TWO WEEKS SINCE OUR FIRST CHAT. NOTATWIN: OUR ANNIVERSARY. HOW SWEET. THOREAU 786: SINCE IT'S A SPECIAL OCCASION, MY REAL NAME'S WARREN COLLIER. IF YOU'RE EVER IN THE CITY, I'D LOVE TO MEET. GOTTA GO. Accompanying the text, a PICTURE Warren has sent finishes downloading -- eighteenish, the shaggy chic, Calvin Klein model-type.Morning, Dad.How's the book coming?Still stuck, huh?Another one for the trophy room, huh?I've prepared a color-coded itinerary based on dividing the day into fifteen minute increments alternating blue/red, double- checked the train schedule, confirmed with the Weather Channel and rehearsed a couple of alternate scenarios last night, you know, just to account for all the possible glitches.I want to hit the ground running. All those football games and the partying and the whole dating scene. It just seems like a lot of wasted time that could be spent more productively.What -- ?! Drew CHOKES on her granola and a little milk trickles out her nose.No... I mean, it's... impossible. I've got every minute accounted for right up to the interview. Blue and red! It won't work.I'm sorry, Mom. It's really sweet of you. But don't worry. Parker will be living here with you forever since no college on earth will ever take her.Time to go.You're smart. You're resourceful. You'll find a way to make it work. She tries to sell herself on this by smiling, but something in the smile suggests SHE'S SCREWED. Collecting her Dayplanner, purse, interview file and cell phone, she drops them into her matching Coach shoulder bag.Ah, darn it, Mom. That's a shame. It's like fate is conspiring against us.You absolutely, positively have to promise me we'll do it another time.Mom, you know, I might not get in.Hey! Stop! Drew takes off running after the car!PARKER!!You know, Parker. Chemistry is important. When you think about it, everything's made of chemicals.Professor Spaulding. Good afternoon. I'm Drew MacLeod. An EXECUTIVE takes the aisle seat next to her, and after a sideways glance at Drew's portable office, opens his Wall Street Journal as the train begins to pull away. EVERY COMMUTER is quietly reading the paper or staring off into their own world, wondering why their life has lead them to this sad moment when... ... they're all distracted by an AWFUL, AWFUL VOICE singing Sheryl Crow's \"Soak Up the Sun.\" It's Parker, wearing her headphones and looking for a seat in the full train car. Drew stares at her, dumbfounded.What do you think you're doing?This can't be happening. Wait, I know. This is one of those Ground Hog Day dreams, isn't it? Drew pinches herself too hard.Ow! I'm awake now. You're supposed to disappear.Then scratch it and get back to school.You're permanently distracted. It's called Attention Deficit Disorder. Is this about that chat room guy? It is, isn't it? A look from the Exec reminds Parker of her headphones and she pulls them off.I swear to God, Parker, you go through boyfriends like Junior Mints. It's pathetic.Is this any of your business? He goes back to his paper.This is ridiculous. I don't have time for this today. Fine. Don't graduate from high school. Make a mess of your life over some complete stranger. I don't care. But leave me out. I have something important I need to accomplish today, so please go away. EXECUTIVE Would you like this seat so you two can fight?I have to mentally preview my day now. I can't talk anymore. Parker turns to go, then remembers something.Excuse me?What are you doing? Drew scrambles to grab her bag, jacket, the little inflatable lap desk falling to the floor.Police? I didn't do anything.No! That's not me! That was my twin sister you threw off!She's right there!I'm... ouch.This can't be happening! I have a... a... little paper thingy. What are they called? Ticket! I have a ticket! It's right... She drops her bag, contents spilling willy-nilly. On her hands and knees, she frantically searches for her ticket in the mess. The Conductor, however, is already on the train stop as it pulls away. He just waves, victorious. Parker steps back out onto the platform and the Conductor spots her. He looks from one sister to the other -- oops, mistake. But it's too late. Sheepishly, he climbs inside and the train is gone.Don't.Oh, just a minor concussion I sustained while the Conductor was throwing me off the train because he thought I was you sneaking back on the train!I'll bet. Drew throws her bag over her shoulder and heads for the ticket counter. The WELT on her forehead is gonna be a doozey.To see when the next train leaves.That can't be. I have to be there before two!What did you just say?Let go of my arm. But Parker drags her away. Drew shoots a look back at the Clerk, who sticks out his tongue at her.What's this?Car service? You couldn't have called for a... But Bennie opens the door for Parker like he's done it a thousand times.Pre-paid? What's 57th and 5th?Not Barneys.This was supposed to be someone else's car, wasn't it?'Scarpelli'? We're supposed to be Italian?This is so... wrong.What's happening?Parker, I think maybe we should get out. Parker sees the LIGHT AHEAD TURN RED.He has no respect for traffic laws! They run into the first ALLEY and hunker down by a GARBAGE CAN. The Lincoln flies past. They dash back out, the same way they came. SCREECH! Bennie LOCKS UP the WHEELS! They round the same corner going the opposite way and Parker pulls them into the first door...Is he gone? I can't believe this. What did you get us into?A rush? Are you out of your mind?Parker, you're only feeding the poor man's disease. Buy him a healthy snack. ... just as the Homeless Guy reaches for the dollar and the SLUSHEE IS KNOCKED FROM HIS HAND. We watch in SLOW MOTION AS THE SLUSHEE TAKES FLIGHT, THE CAP FALLING OFF AND THE STICKY, CHERRY RED MESS FANNINGI will never, ever, forgive you.I could be arrested for vagrancy looking like this.No. No ideas. I'm going straight to that interview and wait, without moving or speaking, especially to you, for four hours.Do you have the slightest clue what that would cost?Oh. My. God.I left it in his car.He knows where I live. He's going to hunt me down and kill me.That won't get me hosed down at a car wash.My secret-safety twenty. Of course. But it's only for emergencies.Yeah. Drew takes off her shoe, lifts the inner sole and pulls out a twenty, then realizes:Hey, how'd you know about my secret-safety twenty?No. I want to get clean, not contract hepatitis.We touch nothing. Parker leads them inside.Sixty dollars an hour for this --It's all we have. Twenty-six dollars and thirty-six cents.I had a little accident, okay?What part of 'That is all the money we have' didn't make sense to you?Not a word. Girl Scout's honor. He grudgingly holds out the key for Parker, who takes it and hands it to Drew while she gets the money out. ON DREW -- sensing something, she looks down at her feet where a HUGE RAT is licking the sweet stuff off her shoes. There's a rather LONG BEAT while this horror sinks in, then:There was a rat, Parker. A rat the size of a Doberman eating my foot.Our money? OUR MONEY?!Parker, it was not 'our' money and this is not 'our' day in New York. What it is, is quite possibly the most important day of my life. I've resigned myself to the fact that you don't give a crap about what you do with yours, but if you could find it in your heart, your tiny, cold steel heart, to respect what this means to me, I would appreciate it. But Parker's not listening. She's staring intently... ... ACROSS THE STREET where several TOWN CARS are parked, the DRIVERS chatting next to a HOT DOG/PRETZEL CART. Among them is Bennie, sipping coffee. Parker spots him and freezes.You're not even listening. That's typical. Look, we're splitting up. Give me back my secret safety money.Paranoid?What's wrong with your eyes?How'd he find us?Or maybe WE TOLD HIM WHERE WE WERESo? Hello? No dinero?No. I'm calling Mom.I'll have her... uh...Dad, then.Damn it, Parker, my itinerary is shot to hell! Blue, red -- Her WATCH ALARM BEEPS.I don't even know what that means! I'm running out of time. Is that guy looking at me? Parker starts to look.Don't look.I think he was.Yeah, but I'm standing in the lobby of the Plaza looking like a deranged street person who might attack at any moment. In fact, I might attack at any moment. The ELEVATOR behind them opens.What are we doing? And why am I whispering?Great. Now we're emulating Blake Greer, voted most likely to commit a felony before having to shave.Oh, we're not going to steal anything. Super. Just a little 'breaking and entering.'No. No. No.No!I can't do this.Oh, no. Oh my god. A... a... What the hell is it?I'm itching already. See? Are my arms red? Drew backs away -- she's about to break for the door.There's a man in there!I'll, uh, go around.I can't do it!No I can't!I did it. Oops, the curtain starts to slip. When she reaches for it she loses her balance and suddenly -- FWONK -- nosedives into the dumpster. The curtain floats INTO THE ALLEY at Parker's feet.Give me... my... curtain. Parker tosses the curtain in and Drew climbs out. They hurry off down the alley. IN THE SECOND STORY FIRE ESCAPE WINDOW -- Morty appears.He thinks we have the dog!A pain -- WHAM! -- Drew's CLOTHESLINED at the intersection by a BIKE MESSENGER who, in a valiant attempt to avoid her, brakes so hard he flies off the handlebars and lands RIGHT ON TOP OF HER.I'm, uh, late for this place, thing, where I'm supposed to be. College. Interview!Why does this not surprise me? THE NEXT MUSIC CUE COMES UP and the SHOWRUNNER grabs Drew...Excuse me, but I'm supposed to be going to my college interview.Everybody washed their hands, right?Perfect.Park... OUTSIDE -- Parker sees Drew caught in the door as Bruce, Morty and the cops close in. Quickly, Parker pushes the door back, releasing Drew, who jumps in and swings out.Sorry.We didn't steal it, I swear.He's right, Parker.So we'll turn ourselves in right after the interview.We're facing felony charges, Parker. Maybe you can do your on- line flirting later. Better yet, he can see you during visitor's hours. Parker reads the incoming MESSAGE from... THOREAU 786: HOW'D CHEM TEST GO?Warren? WARREN?! So you lied, right to my face. No, Drew, this isn't about the chat room guy. Nah! But Parker's typing furiously even as Drew rants on -- she has to lean around Speedy's legs. A GUY buying a newspaper peers down at the strange sight.Are you listening to me?! Give me that stupid thing! Drew reaches for the Blackberry.Parker, you have completely lost your mind if you can be thinking about boys at a time like this! THOREAU 786: PARKER. THANKS FOR SHARING. ANYTHING YOUYou can't possibly know somebody who works at the United Nations. Maybe he meant United Sub Sandwiches. Or United Skate Rats Store.How convenient. You arrange a little date while your sister's future hangs in the balance.Yes.Maybe after the police forgive us for sneaking into someone else's hotel room, we can ask them to please keep the mob hit man from whacking us and dropping us into the marina so he doesn't get his suit dirty.Parker, I know you're trying to cheer me up, but I have to be honest. This is all your fault.Yeah, right! Like you didn't mean to ask Bernie Lipscomb to the prom!I'll bet that was just another accident of yours that happened to screw up my life!You know I did!You asked Bernie just to snake him from me!Do you see him? Parker consults the JPEG PIC on her Blackberry, then scans the group.Oh, shit. What now?We don't have time for this now.We'll get back to that.Angie? Take the 11:00.No one is blowing you off, Warren. As a matter of fact, we're very happy to see you, aren't we, Parker?And we're grateful for your help.Super. Now that that's all settled, is there a restroom I can get to without going out there?They there?They must be searching the building.Let's go. With Warren leading the way, they EXIT the office.Are you okay?I'm kind of in my own private hell right now.Drew.Uh, Canada? It's sort of far away.You want me to take this to the Canadian Representative to the United Nations?Okay. Drew EXITS the stall and goes to the door.Where's the Assembly?Sir? He puts a hand to his stomach -- he's struggling. CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE #2 Yes...Oh, no. You didn't have the mussels at lunch, too, did you? Even as she holds out the file, he races past her, puckering his bum. She watches him waddle up the stairs BUT AS HE EXITS, HE PASSES WILLIAMSON AND THE U.N. SECURITY GUY IN THEWell, I'm not certain... This furrows some brows.... that I NEED to defend our position! Ah, yes, some knowing nods. ON THE NORTH KOREAN REPRESENTATIVE leaning over to confer with the NORWEGIAN REPRESENTATIVE:Absurd?! Uhhh... where now? She notices the FILE the Rep in the bathroom gave her and holds it up, shaking it for emphasis.Not so absurd, since I have the documents right here in my possession! This draws a CHORUS OF MURMURS throughout the hall. The Chinese Rep suddenly looks terribly worried and pauses to confer with his ASSOCIATE. CUT TO:And besides, who said absurd is necessarily bad? Sometimes absurd is good! For instance, absurd can be sort of... funny! In conclusion, I propose that all of you should talk amongst yourselves. Thank you. Like Cinderella at Midnight, she turns and races up the stairs as the Assembly is in complete turmoil -- KOFI ANAN BANGS his gavel.They're following US, Parker!Someone was sick in the bathroom and they asked me to -- hold on, I don't owe you any explanation.You have a lot of nerve, Parker. It was you that got me tossed off the train! You had to give the bum that dollar! You get the suit, I get the leather bikini!And you got Bernie Lipscomb while I got Scrabble with Mom and Dad!It was to me!There's a good reason for that!You know very well what it means, Ms. Big Mouth!Oh yeah? Well, the joke's on you, because there isn't any interview! Oops. This just slipped out in anger. Parker's brain has to adjust, then:No interview. I screwed up.Scheduling the interview. You deaf?I missed the deadline.After they made the first cut from the preliminary application, we were supposed to send in a form to secure our interview time and I filled it out and had everything ready to go in the mailbox and then... Drew is near tears.I forgot.Yes. I just forgot. When I found it in my bag a week later, I'd missed the deadline.I... I was going to try to meet Professor Spaulding and...I called and the secretary said there were no exceptions to the deadline so I was going to try to see him when he finished the other interviews. I knew it was hopeless, but... I was so... embarrassed. Drew wipes her tears, then:Oh, to hell with it. She opens the door and jumps out!Darn it! DARN IT DARN IT DARN IT! This is when she sees, parked just down the block... ROGER'S VAN with \"Michelangelo's Painting\" across the back door.That's... that's the painter. Drew quickly steps into the shadow of a doorway to keep out of sight and watch the van. A BLOCK BEHIND THE TAXI --I can't stop! I have to return this dog!Officer?! Officer?! But SHOW OFFICIAL #3 appears from inside, taps the Policeman on the shoulder -- they need him inside. He turns and goes through the door just as... ... Drew reaches the loading dock and hustles up the stairs.Officer?! She sprints past the other SHOW OFFICIALS checking inWhere's the Policeman? A GROOMER combing a HOUND DOG points toward the CURTAINS on the far side of the room and she blasts off that direction.Please! I'll get hives! Oh, go ahead.I, uh, just wanted to return him. As the other OWNERS and HANDLERS gather their dogs, Williamson hands The Emperor off to Mrs. Lo Biancho while Hogan handcuffs Drew.I didn't take her dog, I swear.But I have this interview. I mean, it's not really an interview. I'd never lie to the police... ... never mind. Just as they push her head down into the car, she glimpses a vaguely familiar face among the myriad GAWKERS -- it's the Bike Messenger. For just an instant they lock eyes before the car pulls away.staring at her INK-STAINED FINGERS as Hogan finishes fingerprinting her other hand.Thank you.Yes, as a matter-of-fact, it is.It's all yours. She hands the high heel to Red, who enthusiastically pulls it on and models it.No thanks. I'll just stay here with the girls.I don't even know him.Thanks, Jim. How'd you know?Huh. No hives. Suddenly, realizing just how awful she must look, Drew becomes self-conscious.Well... bye. She walks past him out the door.Thanks for getting me out of jail but I have to go home now because my entire life is ruined.You turn understatement into an art.I'm Drew MacLeod. The girl who won't be going to the NYU Accelerated Program.Because short of flying, there's no way to get from here to NYU in five minutes.Fine. ... and up the stairs -- then stops, turns.Wait right there. I mean, I don't want to be bossy. You don't have to stay right there, if you don't want to.Great. She launches herself into the building.Professor Spaulding? I can't apologize enough for barging in like this. The Professor is not only thrown by the interruption, but by Drew's particularly bizarre, barefoot look.Parker?What are you doing?You were... being me?That's... sweet.No.It's okay. But let's talk about it later.Parker, consider, just for a moment, whether this is the appropriate time and place.Jealous?You mean subliminally you're undermining me?Well, thank you for saying that.Confess what?Why would I be jealous of you?Nope. Then she smiles, only a teensy bit.Well, maybe about the love slaves. This is the first moment in a long time when the sisters share a smile. Drew turns to the Professor.Professor, I'm Drew MacLeod.I wanted more than anything in the world to be a part of your program. I still do. But I failed. I didn't follow the rules. And honestly, before today, I didn't know how I was going to live with that. How to live with failure. I'm not good at it. I haven't done it much. But today I realized that I've lived in fear of it too long.I hope my application was a strong one and I came here today to ask your indulgence and to place my name back into consideration. If you won't, I'll understand. Better yet, I'll get over it. Maybe I shouldn't be in such a hurry after all. Maybe it would be best for me to just take this... Drew takes her DAYBOOK from Parker and drops it in the wastebasket.... and lighten up. Parker looks horrified at the sight of Drew's daybook in the trash and fishes it out.Thanks for your time. Sorry if you missed your plane. He shakes her hand.Thanks. The sisters hug, but we GO...Yeah?Sure.Yeah. Hey, one minute, 'kay?Thanks.I, uh...First I want to take a shower. For about a week. Drew leans over and kisses him on the cheek. Then she reaches into her bag and pulls out a card.Call me, okay?No. Honestly, it was all an accident. Quinn holds out her hand revealing a BELLY RING.It was... spontaneous.It doesn't really matter one way or the other. Maybe I shouldn't be in such a hurry. Why don't we go out and have some fun. Besides, if this isn't good news, I don't want it to ruin our night. Parker and Quinn simply continue to stare.

{"raw_line": "Morning, baby.Well, sweety, my writing process is a lot like a giant hydroelectric dam. For a long time I just let the great ideas build up and build up until the sheer weight of them spills over and the words just come pouring out.Not a word. Parker ENTERS with her Blackberry in hand, smooches her pop, then takes a sat. Parker's clearly a chip off her Dad's block. Both pour milk first into their bowl, then Charley drops in Super Sugar Crisp while Parker pours in Count Chocula. Both hit 'em with a couple of spoons of extra sugar. Mom takes a seat, too, primly eating a piece of dry wheat toast that she slices in half first. Like Mom, like Drew. Drew spots the BLACKBERRY JPEG of Warren before Parker can turn it over.I'm proud of you for sticking to your plan all these years, sweety.To each her own.Don't you have a chem test, young lady?Good point.Wal-Mart? Hey, Marvin. You bet. Typing away. He glances at the screensaver, the same words pouring out.Today? Gee, I'm on a real roll, Marv. The juices overfloweth, if you get my meaning. Don't want to plug the juices when they're overflowing, right? How much? Hm. I guess I could carve out some time.Got it. See you in the City. Charley hangs up, punches a key on his computer. The screensaver disappears and up pops a BLANK PAGE. At the top: CHAPTER ONE. Nothing else. CUT TO:Hello, beautiful Doctor Lady. How goes your day? Right next to the magazine rack? What did they name it, Newsweek? I'm going into the City to meet some big shot publisher. Maybe I'll swing by NYU afterwards and see if I can give Drew a ride home. You talk to her today? She's probably having too much fun to call. I'll ring her up. Bye bye. He hangs up and of course veers into the other lane again, correcting wildly before resuming his merry way. CUT TO:Hi, baby! Drew goes over to the truck.I was in the city. I tried to call you. Thought you might want a ride home.Is that a new outfit?Sure. Drew goes back to Jim.The guys are here! Parker and Quinn stare at Drew.So, how'd you two meet the girls? Jim and Warren share a look. This is a story best left untold.Dance class, huh? Stupid me.

Won't that be fun?You okay?I just thought... you know... I've been working and we haven't had a chance to spend much time together...... and both my babies are going away to college next Fall. She takes her plate and goes to the sink and Parker follows her, putting an arm around her shoulder.Stop it, you two. Mom blows her nose.I use chemistry every day.Come on, honey! Let's tear up Manhattan! With a shiver, Drew closes the book, looks up into the mirror, takes a squirt off her inhaler to calm herself and tries some self-reassurance.Doctor MacLeod... I'm sorry, but my itinerary is booked solid today. Call Dr. Wessels. He's covering for me. He did? Are you sure it's the baby's head? All right. I'm coming. Frustrated, Mom hangs up and with a look of profound disappointment, turns to Drew.I'm sorry, hon. It's a Blue Light special in Maternity. Every bed's full and some poor woman is about to give birth in the gift shop. I have to go in. Drew musters her best sad, sad face for her mom.I know.I promise. I better hurry.

Nobody's smarter, nobody works harder and nobody, and I mean nobody, is ever more prepared. Drew smiles, hugs her mom and jumps out, waving as her mom backs down the drive and disappears down the street. With the weight of the world suddenly lifted from her shoulders, Drew looks to the sky and mouths, \"thank you.\" This is when Parker comes hauling down the driveway in her Honda Accord. Drew signals her to stop, so of course her sister IGNORES HER and jets into the street.Mrs. Greenspan? You're going to have to help. I need you to push.

A SOCIETY FRIEND of Mrs. Lo Biancho, BABS, arrives to pay her respects, shuffling her feet across and leaning in to trade air kisses.Dear Babs. I'm at wit's end. When she turns on Morty and Bruce, they both jump a little.You! Tell the thieves I'll pay anything they want! Anything!Precisely!I'll give them ten grand, tops, but only if the dog's back before show time.Yes? Morty and Bruce have their tracing gear rigged to her phone but have to keep following her around the box.-- I'll give you ten grand but only if he's in Madison Square Garden in... She looks to her husband, who consults his watch and then holds up ONE FINGER.One hour. Take it or leave it. Bruce SIGNALS her -- keep him on the line!You have one minute to decide. She hangs up. Bruce and Morty SIGH.Yesss?-- First of all, you forgot to disguise your voice.Secondly, my husband will meet you in ten minutes on the corner of 43rd and Broadway. He'll have the money. Bring the dog.Fine.The police, it appears, have other priorities, like humans or something. And I assure you, the Hotel Security... people... will not interfere. In any case, little man, we just want the dog back before showtime, do you understand?Ciao. She hangs up. Roger does, too.Good God. He's mauve.Flog her! Step aside and I'll whip her myself!So she had an accomplice! We'll beat the information out of the little wench! Get him cleaned up, Emile.

We'll split up. You go that way! You take Fifth! Come on, get on your horse! Morty and Bruce take the cop's order and race off in separate directions. Neither Hogan nor his partner moves.Sure. Williamson and Hogan step over to a hot dog cart set up next to a NEWSPAPER STAND.Where do you think those two went?Might have stashed it.Hey, Speedy. You didn't see a couple of blondes run past here, did you?That's where they all go.I say we put Abbott and Costello on the ransom watch. I don't want to be stuck in the same room all day with Leona Helmsley's nasty stepsister.See if you can pick them up. We're on our way. Zoom! Williamson blasts crosstown. CUT TO:Hey! You two! Stop!Fine. But we're gonna have to stop for lunch pretty soon, 'cause I'm getting heartburn. They pull into traffic, following the Cab. In a BEAT, Bennie's Town Car follows, too.I think so. Maybe she's going for the dog.So we stay with the taxi?We stay with the taxi.I'm telling you, I got a hunch these girls don't have anything to do with this dog. Drew blows past them, holding The Emperor. The Detectives exchange glances -- nice hunch -- and they LEAP OUT OF THE CAR TO JOIN THE CHASE.MacLeod? Hogan ENTERS, opens the cell door.You're free to go.An eyewitness says he saw who took the dog. Didn't realize the guy was stealing it until he saw us grab you. Hogan takes her by the arm in a fatherly way and leads her out.There's your alibi.That's what he said. Go home. Get cleaned up, a good night's sleep. None of this will seem so bad in the morning.

Warren moves back to Drew and Parker.Yeah, I, uh...I just have to do this tour and... But Williamson and Hogan, led by the U.N. Security Guy, ENTER the lobby. Drew grabs Warren by the arm and turns him.What's going on? Parker looks Warren right in the eye. This is a test.Okay. Let me get somebody to cover for me. Warren leads them into a small adjoining office...Hey, Angie, take the 11:00 for me, will you?What was I supposed to do? I liked you. If I'd sent a real picture, would you have met me?That means no. At least this way I got to see you before you blow me off.Not-a-twin, huh?Yeah, well. I guess everybody would like the world to see them a little bit differently than they are.What's wrong with going out there?Police? I thought you guys were joking.Well that door's the only way out. There's a restroom at the end of the main hall. Parker opens the office door, peeking out.What'd you guys do, anyway? Mug a couple supermodels?This way! Almost instinctively, they go COMPLETELY SEPARATE WAYS, Warren and Parker breaking left, Drew right. Drew makes a mad dash down a hallway, makes a turn, another turn, working her way deeper into the labyrinth. Even while running frantically, she tries to smile politely at everyone she passes until she spots a WOMEN'S room and quickly ditches inside.He's gone. Parker pops up from the same sack. Face to face, there's an awkward moment of attraction between them.You have nice breath.Something tells me that won't be too tough. Warren points to the MONITOR. Parker's jaw drops. Her sister is addressing the entire U.N. Assembly. CUT TO:Jin zshe miya BRAD PITT! SCREAMING LIKE BANSHEES, the Japanese Girls all pour outside, Warren and the Girls following.Dingo cashito, BRAD PITT ezukai! The JAPANESE GIRLS turn around and STORM BACK THROUGH THE DOORS, blocking Williamson and Hogan's EXIT. The three of them run for the line of taxis.I may not look like an underwear model, but I'm smarter than a hundred of them put together. Warren grabs a Taxi door.Come on!I'm smart AND rich! Williamson and Hogan have fought their way out through the little Japanese Girls. Realizing they won't reach Parker and Drew in time, they head for their own unmarked cruiser which is parked just ahead of... Bennie's TOWN CAR. He's holding the door for a cigar- chewing CLIENT but watching the Girls climb into the cab up ahead.You know, technically, you have to have security clearance to enter the Assembly.Which isn't so bad.Who's Bernie Lipscomb?Sort of a guerilla interview? You know, I'm a big Michael Moore fan... A look from Parker quiets Warren. Drew's choked up. She just nods, yes.She's pretty upset.I think she took a right up there.You think she made it?What now?What on earth did happen?Hello, sir.Kill?Really? You came into town just for me? Wow.Well, he certainly is a good Samaritan. Parker looks at the daybag.You guys lead a pretty interesting life, don't you? But now Parker's mind is elsewhere. She pulls out Drew's daybook, opens it.We going to the jail, or what? I've never been to a jail before.Hey! I'm an intellectual! I never claimed to be athletic!As a matter of fact, I was excused from P.E. because of an ascended testicle! Too much information, right? CUT TO:Wow. And I thought I was anal.You know, I've always had a thing for librarians.Got it.Good luck, Drew. CUT TO:Sure you will. Warren pulls out a CELL PHONE, hits speed dial.Dad? Hey. I need a favor.Yes!
