In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?She is presently at the Bonaventure Hotel. That's right near here.When you leave this van you will get yourself a cab and take it to the Bonaventure Hotel. Then you will take this....and you will kill the woman whose picture is in there. Not just shoot her, mind,! kill her. I'd recommend you empty the gun into her. Close up. Got all that?What's your point?Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.It is now 12:16.

Have a cracker.Have a cracker, Mr. Watson.There was this guy. Big guy. Irish- Italian. Red-faced, black-haired, jolly son-of-a-bitch.Nobody could make me laugh like him. We closed more bars together than I can count. He was my pal. I loved that crazy mick, I'm not ashamed to say it. But he was fuck-up. He had this image of himself. Thought he was con man.
