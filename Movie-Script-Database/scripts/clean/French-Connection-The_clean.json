The manufacturer's spec says it should weigh 4,719 pounds. This one's carrying roughly 120 extra pounds somewhere.When it was booked in at Marseilles it weighed the same. 120 pounds overweight. Jimmy has to be right.Got it for you, Randy -- it just came in from downtown. Who's Devereaux?I'm sorry, Mr. Devereaux, but we get reports on a couple hundred vehicles a night. Sometimes it's a little tough to keep track.Yeah -- fine -- it's okay -- not even a scratch. You're all set.Someone stole it right off the street, huh?
