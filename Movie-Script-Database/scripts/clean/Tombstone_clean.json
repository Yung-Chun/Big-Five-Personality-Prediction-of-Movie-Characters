So the judge said, can't have a Murder without a witness-case Dismissed. Can you beat it? After All that. Oh hell, who cares, None of my business anyways.You tell 'em, Virge.You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money. Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings. Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.Pretty fun too, isn't it?Cat got your tongue?Wait a minute, Virgil! Where you goin'?Virgil, please. Don't do this to me.Nothing to do with me? I'm your Brother for Christ's sake. God, I Don't believe this. Talk to him, will you? Or hit him. Oh no, don't tell me...Listen to me, both of you. This Is no good. This is trouble we Don't need. For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family. Do this and you throw it All away. You saw what happened To Fred White.Yeah?All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else. It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone. But it's Not too late for you, Morg.All the years I worked the Cowtowns, I was only ever mixed Up in one shooting. Just one. A Man got killed. Wasn't my fault, Just doin' my job. I don't even Know if it was my bullet that Dropped him, but... I don't kno, It's sort of hard to explain. At First I just felt funny, you Know, kind of clammy inside. But When it finally sunk in what I'd Done... Believe me, boy, you Don't ever want to feel that way. Not ever. Didn't even make a dent, did I? You're both makin' a big mistake.This Hooker's ranch?You seen anything of a man on Horseback leading a black Stallion?Well you must've seen somethin', The trail runs right by your Waterhole. Oh, I see. So it must've been a Cowboy, right? Really got you People treed, don't they?McMasters, isn't it? Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property backSo what about you Cowboys anyway?Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...Where'd you get that horse?I asked where you got him.Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back. One way Or another.Look kid, I know what it's like, I was a kid, too. Even stole a Horse once. But you can't--Make you a deal. My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone. Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans. You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.They were all gonna jump me back There. What ever happened to one Against one?And how come you call yourselves Cowboys? Cowhands ride for the brand.This brand.Maybe I jumped the gun. Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted. You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...Business is business. Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em. Not If there's money in it.Oh, hell...We've never actually met. My Name's-I know what it means.Easy now... That mare's in season.They know. It's the scent. We Better split 'em up.Yeah, I'm an oak all right.You're not that crazy, are you?You know you almost got us both Killed back there?You'd die for fun?I laugh sometimesAm I happy? I don't know. Happy As the next man, I guess. I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all. Am I Happy? Are you happy?What about her?Where do you get these questions?I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.How would you know?Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids. That suits Me right down to the ground. In Fact, that's my idea of heaven. All right, what's your idea of heaven?You mean Behan? Then why are you with him?The way you talk. Never heard a Woman talk like that.Well you're different, no arguing That. But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.I don't know, doesn't make any Sense. I almost can't look at You. Like it hurts.God...Then let's make sure we get our Money's worthFortuitous even.Easy to fix. Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.Well you'll always be Sadie to me.Getting late. We better get back.Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot. I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.I didn't mean it that way.I can't, I'm sorry. Forgive me.That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.Out ridin'. So... how you doin'?Really? You sure?Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on. And we could Stay on the move, you know? Just Keep going, see the world. Live On room service the rest of our Lives. How'd that be?Just thinkin' out loud. Forget it.I know. And nobody can make him.Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.But Doc-Sorry, sorry...Nice voice.Virgil, don't! Take it easy! Ike, Just go home and forget it, will you?Get a doctor! Virgil, give me a hand.What the hell's going on?Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right. Just the Same, though... Guess you better swear me in.Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.You'll never make that stick.Virge, that's a misdemeanor. You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?All right, Virge, your call. But Give Doc the shotgun. They'll be Less apt to get nervy if they see Him on the street howitzer.Well... Come on, boys.Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up. Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble. And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.Look at 'em all. They love it. How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this?Oh, great. Disarmed my ass...Oh, my God...This fight's commenced. Get to Fightin' or get away!Behind us!I don't think I'll let you arrest Us today, Behan. Maybe tomorrow.Guess we did our good deed for today.I'm sorry. If there was any other-How you doin', boy?I know, kid. I know. Me too.Mattie. What about this?'Least you admit it.Look, Mattie, I know you're-All right, look. I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie. I can, I swear.I'm the one made a mess. Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.All they ever did was make fun of him.Don't want any more trouble, Ringo.I'm not gonna fight you, there's No money in it. Sober up. Come On, boys.Bundle up, Virge. Cold out there.That didn't sound like thunder.Virgil?It's all my fault. If I hadn't been So damn smart, if I'd just...

Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.Bless you, darling Darling! Are you mad? You're not Wearing a bustle. How lewd!Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst. Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call. Cover your ears, darling.Isn't that a daisy?Now Ed, are we cross?Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say! Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore? You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it.There, now we can be friends Again. But remember, Ed, Friendship is trust-so please Don't hurt me.Does it hurt? A lot? Good.Well, good evening then.I calculate that's the end of This town. And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.My sweet clever Magyar, so that's Why you're not wearing a bustle.Perfect, Wyatt. Simply perfect.Since when is faro a business?I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger. The Odds are all with the house.That's what I love about Wyatt. He can talk himself into anything.Oh sorry, Johnny, I forgot all About you. You can go now. Just Leave the shotgun.Forgive me if I don't shake hands.Little ahead of yourselves, Aren't you? This is just a mining Camp.I can hardly wait.Very cosmopolitan.Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion? Watch your ear, Creek.Well, an enchanted momentKate, you know the Earps.Very instructiveYou may indeed. If you get lucky.And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.So tell me, Wyatt. I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man? Forsaking all Others?I see. And what would you do if \"she\" walked in her right now?You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.Ignore her?I'll remember you said that.I stand corrected. Wyatt. You're An oak.Here's a man you should meet, Mr. Fabian. Excellent character study For you, the real-life actual Melancholy Dane.Well he hems, he haws, he talks Out of both sides of his Mouth-but all on a very high Plane, just like Hamlet.That's the rumor.Not me. I'm in my prime.And you must be Ringo. Look, Darling, Johnny Ringo. The Deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill, they say. What do you Think, darling? Should I hate him?Yes, but there's just something About him. Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me. No. I'm sure of it, I Hate him.In vino veritas.Credat Judaeus Apella.In pace requiescat.Evidently Mr. Ringo's an educated Man. Now I really hate him.Enough? Never.What?I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.You will or you won't. Don't look To me. I'm going to sleep.I have two guns. One for each of you.Wyatt! Just in time. Pull up a chair.Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.I won't be pawed at, thank you Very muchWhy, Ike, whatever do you mean?Maybe poker's not your game, Ike. I know, let's have a spelling Contest!Well that certainly was a bust. I Want my money back. Come, Darling, let's seek our Entertainment elsewhere.Nothing. Not a thing. I'm right As the mail.So what does that mean?Well, that sounds inviting.Better.We must talk, darling. It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.Not exactly...Yes, I know. You are a good woman.Then again, you may be the Antichrist.What the hell's going on? I've Had five people walk up to me Saying the Clantons and McLaurys Are gunning for me.That's a hell of a thing for you To say to me.You're a daisy if you do!You call that shooting?That's just my game.On three? You call it.Can't you see why he did it?And so she walked out of our Lives forever.Oh... All right.You know why I'm here. My Hypocrisy only goes so far.Say something witty.It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.They saw us. Here they come.Don't touch me!Not half as bad as I feel.Wyatt Earp is my friend.I don't.Look!Wyatt!Come on!Wyatt, my God! You're shot to pieces!I don't believe it. He's clean!I'm telling you, there isn't a Mark on him.I'm a man without fear, Wyatt. I Literally don't care if I live or Die. But even I can't fight human Instinct. Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?Down at the creek. Walking on water.Don't touch me, God damn it! Just Don't touch me! Come on...A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it. He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it. And it drives him mad. Sick mad. Cold and dirty.What does he want? He wants revenge.Being born.No, wait, I'll go with you...I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Wyatt. God, I'm so sorry.Never got to wear one of those.Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave. Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.I beg to differ. We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?I wasn't. And this time it's legal.Say when.Come on! Come on!Oh Johnny. You're no daisy, no Daisy at all.Poor soul, he was so high-strung. Afraid the strain was more than He could bear.Let's go! My horse is over here.I just wanted to see what it felt Like. Here...Well hell, Wyatt. Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney. Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome. You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree? A better one might be how Do you feel?I imagine it would, yes. So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.You think I'm kidding. You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known. Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.When will you wake up? You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt. Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's. Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life. There's Only life, that's all. Just life. The rest is relative.First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.Run. Take that girl and start Running. Run and don't look back. All your life you been running And looking back and just barely Existing and calling it getting By. This time run and don't look Back and call it living. Live Every second, live it right up to The hilt. Live, Wyatt... Live for me.Wyatt, please, if you were ever My friend, if you ever had even The smallest feeling for me, Leave. Leave now. Please.Never mind, Wyatt. I know. Just go.Now let's see, Father. What was That monkey show you were talking about?That's it. Better start that ball rolling.I'll be damned...
