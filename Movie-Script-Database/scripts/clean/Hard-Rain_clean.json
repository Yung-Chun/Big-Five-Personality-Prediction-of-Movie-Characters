{"Hard-Rain": {"TOM": {"raw_line": "Well, it's not fast enough.It's a flood, Charlie. You're gonna get wet.Well, yeah.Your ear.You've got a major hair growth going on.I'm serious. You're gonna need somebody to go in there with a weed whacker.You're offering me one of your donuts? I don't know what to say. I'm getting all misty.Nah. I start eating donuts and I'll never get out of this truck.Don't get me wrong, Charlie. There's a lot to like about this job -- and I don't just mean the dashing polyester ensemble and the solid three-figure income.Charlie, relax! I was kidding!It had better hours.That wasn't luck, old man. That was skill. I was good at it.About as much skill as it takes to sit in a truck and get fat eating donuts.I didn't say that.I didn't say that!Jerk.Give us a kiss. Come on.You really are a cranky old fart, you know that?What was that about? I mean, I'm just sitting here and all of a sudden you go postal on me.You know, I really do appreciate what you've done for me. This is a good job.Jesus. Where's the road?Oh, God, here we go again.Stop!Stop the truck! We're going down!Back up!It's a little dip in the road or something. You can see the reflectors come up the other side.I'll see if there's anyone coming. Maybe we can get pulled out.The town's been evacuated. We won't get any help from there.They are aware we're carrying a shitload of money...?Ninety minutes? Jesus.Oh, shit.What about the money?Why'd they do that?Or so we can't see at all.Anyone with a scanner from Radio Shack could've intercepted your call, Charlie.Could you turn down your lights?!Turn down your lights!Low tide, sailor.Yee-hah!I'm not a looter.I just said I'm not a looter! You're the one who nailed me? You got a better arm than my ex-wife. What the hell did you hit me with -- a statue? I saw a flash of some guy coming at me.Oh, great. Now I'm gonna have people coming from around the world to see the face of Jesus on my forehead.Looking for a place to hide out.The bastards who killed my partner.We were driving an armored truck. The truck got stuck out past the high school. They must've picked up our call to dispatch, 'cause they knew where we were. Charlie and I were just standing there and all hell broke loose.A little over three million.The bank was afraid of looters. They had us cleaning out their branches up and down the river.I hid it in the cemetery. Tied it to a crypt for a guy named Portman.I don't like to carry around that much cash.No, it was in my jacket and I --I'll go with you. I can show you where --Sheriff -- they killed my partner without any warning.Great! I can drive out of here!Thank you.Even. What happened?Oh, God.I can't.If they know where the money is, they will kill us.I guess just drive around until we run out of gas.When we get down here a little further we'll find a place for you to hide. I'm gonna get back to the truck and wait for the National Guard. They should be there pretty soon.Cold?No. The scariest thing that ever happened before was Charlie running out of donuts. I've only been doing this for a couple months.I, uh... I sold construction machinery. I was making good money, it just... I don't know. It just didn't seem right for me anymore.My uncle did me a favor; got me in.My uncle was Charlie -- my partner in the truck.God, I wonder whose car this is.Really? Hold on... ...I think this is my car from high school.Looks like we get out here. Come on -- I told your father I'd have you home by ten.There!Get your feet up!Oh, shit!It's metal!We've gotta --!We have to --!Jesus Christ!It's okay. I have to go anyway.The National Guard'll be at the truck in about fifteen minutes. I'm gonna go wait for them.Karen? I'm Tom.You wanna come with me?I'll take you to the money, but you gotta let them go.You say all you want is the money? Prove it. Let them go.Karen?I...It's hard to tell now with the water so deep.It's down there a little further.Uh... no. A little farther --What?I don't --Oh, God. You intercepted Charlie's call, then you called them off.Bullshit. This is all bullshit.Why'd you shoot him? Kill Charlie and you get to keep another share?I'll tell you where it is. But it's not going to do you any good.The Guard may not be coming, but someone else sure as hell is.There.It's gone.Looks like somebody beat you to it.Well, that was unexpected.You really want that money?'Cause the only way you're ever gonna see it is if you help me get Karen.We're too slow.They're not going to catch us now.Okay, so maybe they are gonna catch us now.That hurt?Good.She's in the small boat.Jesus, I'm gonna get hepatitis.There's a back room. Maybe they've got something I can use on this.Oh, yeah.I saw Jesus.So, has this all gone pretty much how you thought it would?Oh, yeah? Well, everything would've gone even better if you hadn't decided to rob the damn truck in the first place!Did Charlie have cancer or something?No.Sorry to disappoint you. What are you gonna do with it?Belize.It's this small country in Central America, on the Atlantic side.They speak English and the dollar goes a long way. Beautiful beaches; friendly people. And they've got liberal banking laws. Very liberal.You can't ride in the truck and not think about it.Shit. Where's he going?The Sheriff knows. I think maybe I'll go ask him.What if he doesn't come?My God they're beautiful.Where's Karen?Where is she?Where's her house?What?Hold on.It's only a couple of bags.But I thought --I'm guessing you can't get up.Where?Is that good or bad?I owe you one.You okay?Oh, God. We gotta get you to --Thanks.You just saved our lives.It's okay!Sorry to disappoint you.I'll do that.They got a lot done today.Barbecue chicken from Lilly's.You want some? I wish you'd told me. I woulda got more.I talked to Mikey. He says the flooring should be in by Friday.I said if it wasn't here by Friday at six that you were going to go over and beat the crap out of him.", "clean_line": "fast flood charlie gonna wet yeah ear ve got major hair growth going gonna need somebody weed whacker offering donuts know getting misty nah start eating donuts ll truck wrong charlie lot like job mean dashing polyester ensemble solid figure income charlie relax kidding better hours wasn luck old man skill good skill takes sit truck fat eating donuts jerk kiss come cranky old fart know mean sitting sudden postal know appreciate ve good job jesus road oh god stop stop truck going little dip road reflectors come ll coming maybe pulled town evacuated won help aware carrying shitload money ninety minutes jesus oh shit money scanner radio shack ve intercepted charlie turn lights turn lights low tide sailor yee hah looter said looter nailed got better arm ex wife hell hit statue saw flash guy coming oh great gonna people coming world face jesus forehead looking place hide bastards killed partner driving armored truck truck got stuck past high school ve picked dispatch cause knew charlie standing hell broke loose little million bank afraid looters cleaning branches river hid cemetery tied crypt guy named portman like carry cash jacket ll sheriff killed partner warning great drive thank happened oh god know money kill guess drive run gas little ll place hide gonna truck wait national guard pretty soon cold scariest thing happened charlie running donuts ve couple months uh sold construction machinery making good money know right anymore uncle favor got uncle charlie partner truck god wonder car hold think car high school looks like come told father home feet oh shit metal ve gotta jesus christ okay national guard ll truck minutes gonna wait karen tom wanna come ll money gotta let want money prove let karen hard tell water deep little uh little farther oh god intercepted charlie called bullshit bullshit shoot kill charlie share ll tell going good guard coming sure hell gone looks like somebody beat unexpected want money cause way gonna help karen slow going catch okay maybe gonna catch hurt good small boat jesus gonna hepatitis room maybe ve got use oh yeah saw jesus gone pretty thought oh yeah ve gone better hadn decided rob damn truck place charlie cancer sorry disappoint gonna belize small country central america atlantic speak english dollar goes long way beautiful beaches friendly people ve got liberal banking laws liberal ride truck think shit going sheriff knows think maybe ll ask come god beautiful karen house hold couple bags thought guessing good bad owe okay oh god gotta thanks saved lives okay sorry disappoint ll got lot today barbecue chicken lilly want wish told woulda got talked mikey says flooring friday said wasn friday going beat crap"}}}
