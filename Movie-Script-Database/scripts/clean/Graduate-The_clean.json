{"Graduate-The": {"BEN": {"raw_line": "- and today it is right that we should ask ourselves the one most important question: What is the purpose of these years, the purpose for all this demanding work, the purpose for the sacrifices made those who love us? Were there NOT a purpose, then all of these past years of struggle, of fierce competition and of uncom- promising ambition would be mean- ingless. But, of course, there is a purpose and I must tell it to you. I ask you to remember this purpose always and I pledge that I shall endeavor to carry it with me forever.The purpose, my fellow graduates - the purpose is -- there is a reason, my friends, and the reason is -- the reason is - the purpose is -Look, Dad - could you explain to them that I have to be alone for a while?I'm just -Well -I don't know. I want it to be -Different.Thank you, Mrs. Carlson.Sir?Yes, ma'am.Excuse me - I think I'd just like to check something on the car for a minute -Just fine, Mr. Loomis.Helpingham.I was going to go upstairs for a minute -Well - that's a little hard to say -Mr. McQuire.Yes, sir.Yes I am.Exactly how do you mean?Yes, I will.Excuse me just a minute -It's down the hall.Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.Look, Mrs. Robinson, I don't mean to be rude but -No.Is what a girl?Oh - no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.That's right.What?What?Here - you take it.Do you know how to work a foreign shift?You don't?Let's go.Dad - Mrs. Robinson needs a ride home. I'll be right back.Right.What?What for?But it's light in there now.Look - I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?All right then.Why not?When is he coming back?No.Are you always this much afraid of being alone?Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?What do you mean?Well - I've always thought that you were a very - nice - person.What?Look - I think I should be going -Mrs. Robinson - if you don't mind my saying so - this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and -What?Oh my God.Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.Mrs. Robinson, you didn't - I mean you didn't expect -I mean - you didn't really think that I would do something like that.What do you think?For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.Mrs. Robinson - you are trying to seduce me.Aren't you?Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.What is wrong with me?Her portrait?No.Very much.Elaine certainly is an attractive girl, isn't she?I don't remember her as having brown eyes.Yes?Oh. Well, goodnight.I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.I know that. But I'm -Right.I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.Yes, I have -But I just - Look - what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.But they would! Don't you see?I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't -What?I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.Yes.I have to go now. I'm sorry.Where is it?Mrs. Robinson?Well here's the purse.Well I'll hand it to you.Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.I'm putting it on the top step.I'm putting it here by the door.I'd rather not.Right.Oh God.Let me out.Get away from that door.Jesus Christ!Oh my God.Let me out!Yes. Yes. Let me out!Yes, sir!I drove - I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I - I drove her home.She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.Yes, sir.Oh no.I've got to go.No. No - I'm just - I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.Thank you very much, sir.Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.Thank you.Sir?I know.What?Quite a while.Yes, sir.Thank you.I'd like to hear it.I've got to go.Oh no.Oh yes.I will.Yes.Mrs. Robinson - I don't quite know how to put this -Look - I was thinking about that time after the party -- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something -Uh - The Taft Hotel.No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather -What?What? Oh - no - I'm just -What?Oh - yes. The Singleman party.Ahh - thank you.Hello.No - actually I'm not -How do you do, Miss DeWitte?Oh - sorry -Of course.Benjamin Braddock, sir.Yes, but I'm afraid -No - actually I'm just looking for a friend.I'm not with your party - I'm sorry.Oh. Hello. Hello.Of course.Very well. Thank you.A drink? Of course.He didn't see me.Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's - it's pretty hard to be suave when you're -What?I haven't. No.Well - I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.Now?Well - I don't know.Why don't I get it? Well - I will then. If you'll excuse me.A room. I'd like a room, please.A single. Just for myself, please.What? No. Nothing.Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.What?Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.Oh no.I mean I'd - I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it my- self. If that's all right.Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.Thank you.I got a single room.But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean - I don't know what their policy is - but -Yes - I think that would be good.Well - goodbye then -Yes?To tell you?Well - I want you to know how much I appreciate this - really -What?Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.You're welcome. Well - I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.I've got it.I say I've got it.The toothbrush. I got it all right.Yes. Well - goodnight.Well.Yes?Sure. Shall I - I mean shall I just stand here? I mean - I don't know what you want me to do.Oh - sure. Thank you.What?Oh - yes. Wood?Wood or wire? They have both.Okay.Certainly.You're welcome.Mrs. Robinson - I can't do this.This is all terribly wrong.Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think - I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --No - but look - maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson - would you like to go to a movie.Is this - what?That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.Are you kidding?Wait a minute!Who said it was my first time.Wait a minute.INADEQUATE!Don't move.- here - in the pool.Well - it's very comfortable - just to drift here.No.You got me.Oh - not too much. Taking it easy.I will.Hello, Mrs. Robinson.Sure.What?When I go off?No, I do. I want to tell you.I drive around.Nothing else.Oh, no.Meet someone?Why did you say that?No wait. Wait.I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?Well, wait.You think I'm being dishonest?Well why do you - why do you think that?Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?I do.I'm not. But I'm - I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after -You believe me, don't you?You don't?But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.Wait a minute. Sit down a minute.Will you please sit down a minute.Will you leave that shoe on for a minute. Please.Now - do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?Good. I mean are we dead or something?All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?Anything. Anything at all.Oh my God.Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the god- damn clothes off and --Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.Oh.Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.Art. Well what do you want to know about it.Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.You're not interested in art?Then why do you want to talk about it?No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.Yes I do.Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.What one.What novel did you read.There!Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you - how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.There's no risk?How do you get out of the house?You walk right out the door.What do you say to him?Always?Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.But what about the noise from the car. What if -We're talking.We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.Now let's keep going here.Right.Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.So you don't - I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.Well how long has this been going on.Oh no. Are you kidding me?You have not slept with your husband for five years?How many times a year.Man, is this interesting.So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you -Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.But you don't hate him.Well how do you feel about him, then?Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.What?Well, wait a minute. You married him.Why did you do that?Well I can't.I can't see why you did, unless ...you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?Was he a law student at the time?And you were a student also.At college.What was your major?Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?Art?But I thought you - I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.Well how did it happen?I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?I'm curious.Oh no. In the car you did it?What kind of car was it?Do you remember the make of the car?Really. I want to know.A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford.Don't talk about Elaine?Why not?Well why don't you?I wish you'd tell me.Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?Well - I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.I was just kidding around.But why shouldn't I?Then let's hear them.Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to -I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?Well, I'm not.No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken- down alcoholic!And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.Because - Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.You're goddamn right I am.Now don't start this.Don't start acting hurt.Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.Of course you did.Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.You wouldn't.What are you doing?Well look - I was kind of upset there. I'm sorry I said those things.But it's not.Oh no. Look - I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.Yes. Please. I want you to.Well don't thank me, because I want you to.Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occured to me to take her out.This is absurd.All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.Look - Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.That has nothing to do with it -I do.I'll go call Elaine now.Hello.Yes.Hello.Yes.No.No.Yes.Do you want some dinner?Bring a menu.No. Just for her.No.If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.Sit down.Why don't you watch the show?No - why should I?You're missing a great effect here.How do you like that?Could you do it?Elaine - I'm sorry.I'm sorry I took you in there.But, Elaine -I just want to tell you something.But could I just tell you this one thing?This whole idea - this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.No. What I mean is - that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.Listen - could you stop crying, please?But could you try?Elaine -I've had this feeling - ever since I've graduated - this - kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?It's like I've been playing some kind of - game - but the rules don't make any sense to me -- they're being made up by all the wrong people - no - I mean no one makes them up, they seem to have made themselves up.Say - I wonder if I could request you to turn that down a little?No, I mean - I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.Wait a minute.No - I was just thinking - look - it's still early - we could do something - go somewhere else.I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.Listen, Elaine - it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean - as far as I know.Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.Of course not.Come on, Elaine. We're leaving.I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.Elaine - I like you. I like you so much. Do you believe that?Do you?You're the first - you're the first thing for so long that I've liked. The first person I could stand to be with.I mean my whole life is such a waste. It's just nothing. I'm sorry. I'll take you home now.It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?Yes.Yes. She had a husband and a son.No.Yes.Can we do something tomorrow?During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.You sure you really want to?Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!You do?Mrs. Robinson - I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.Now it seems to me -Mrs. Robinson -How?I don't believe you.Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.I just don't believe you would do that.Elaine!Elaine?I'm coming up.You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.Hurry up. Put your shoes on.NO.Why aren't you ready?There isn't time!Elaine - I have to tell you something.That woman -That woman. The older woman.Yes. The married woman - it wasn't just some woman -Elaine -Please.No - don't cry -Don't cry.I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.I'm going up to Berkeley today.No. I think you'll want to wait on that.No - they don't.About an hour ago.No. She doesn't know about it.No. Actually - she doesn't know about us getting married yet.We haven't.No - it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.She doesn't. To be perfectly honest, she doesn't like me.Elaine Robinson.Elaine Robinson. Does she live here?Not exactly.I said - not exactly - no.Well - I'm just sort of traveling through.Ahhh.I'm not up too much, actually, I'm just visiting. I mean - I've always wanted to see Berkeley.What?Oh - no sir.Elaine. Hey - what a surprise. Say - I thought I remembered that you were going to school up here - well - we'll have to get together sometime - I'll be up here myself for a little while.- it certainly has been nice - I think I'm late - yes, I am -I was wondering where you were headed.Ah. Where?Where are you meeting this person?The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you.Is that him over there?Where did he say he was going to meet you?Oh.Here? In Berkelely?Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street - and I've been getting to some classes -No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.Here he comes.I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.He certainly is a good walker.We thought you said by the monkey house.Great meeting you, Carl.Swell seeing you. Have a good time.Come in.Come in.Because - I am.What do you think?All right then! Yes!Elaine - I love you.What?Did you say rape her?What did she say?You've got to tell me what she said.Because it isn't true.Tell me.Then what?Elaine - that is not what happened.All right - but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home - then we went upstairs to see your portrait -- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off - and -- suddenly there she was without any clothes on - I mean really naked -Oh - hello, Mr. McCleery.It's all right, Mr. McCleery.It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.Look - she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.What?Hey - wait a minute. Now damn it - look.See - she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.No, sir.Mr. McCleery?What for?Elaine - right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.If you want.My belt.No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for. What's this? It's from my grandmother.The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.I don't know.No.Elaine - you're going to have to stop asking me that.I don't understand.But Elaine -What's happening?What?Will you marry me?You won't?But you might.Is that so? You might marry me?When?How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but -You mean you're confused?Well - look - don't be confused. We're getting married.We just can.Elaine - are you serious about this?You really will?Well - let's get together sometime.Good God!We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.We'll need our Birth Certificates. I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours?Why wouldn't it?Why wouldn't it?Tomorrow then - can we get our blood tests tomorrow morning?Why don't I just drag you off? All right - I will. Right after we get the blood tests.Carl who?Carl who?Who - that guy at the Zoo?Why do you have to see him?You WHAT?How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.Well, what did he say? I'm curious.Oh no. He said that.Where did he do it?I'd like to know where it happened?It wasn't in his car, was it?Are we getting married tomorrow?The day after tomorrow?Mr. Robinson?No, it's not --It was nothing to do with you, sir.Now look - please -I am not threatening you.I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.No, I don't.But why?It shouldn't make any difference what happened.Listen to me. We got - we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might - we might just as well have been shaking hands.You miss the point.The point is - I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.HUH?Mr. McCleery - do you have some change? I need to use the phone?Look - I'll give you ten dollars for a dime - I'll give you twenty - for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?Could I make one phone call first?Elaine - Elaine -Elaine?Where is she?Where is Elaine?What have you done to her?You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.What the hell have you done?I'll find her.Wedding! God Damn it - wedding!Say - fellows -Do any of you fellows know where Carl Smith is?Do you happen to know where he's getting married? I'm supposed to be there.Would you happen to know where I might find him?You don't happen to know exactly where the Make Out King is getting married, do you? I'm supposed to be there.Yes.Do you have a phone?Hello - who is this?Is the doctor anywhere?Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother - Reverend Smith - and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in - from - Portland - and I've forgotten what church - you see?Thank you.Allan Street. Where is it?I'm not a priest - I'm a minister.Oh, Jesus - God - no -No!Elaine - Elaine!Come on - don't faint.Out of my way!MOVE!Run, Elaine, run!How much?To the end.Let's go.
