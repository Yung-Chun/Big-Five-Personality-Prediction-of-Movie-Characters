{"Field-of-Dreams": {"RAY": {"raw_line": "My father\u0092s name was John Kinsella. A faded, sepia shot of a dirty little kid on a farm.It\u0092s an Irish name. He was born in North Dakota, in 1896... Young man in doughboy uniform....and never saw a big city until he came back from France in 1918. Chicago. Tenement. Comiskey Park. Ballgames.He settled in Chicago, where he quickly learned to live and die with the White Sox. Died a little when they lost the 1919 World Series... Newspaper headlines. Photo of Shoeless Joe Jackson....died a lot the following summer when eight members of the team were accused of throwing that Series. Dad playing ball. At work. Weeding.He played in the minors for a year or two, but nothing ever came of it. Moved to Brooklyn in \u009235, married Mom in \u009238, and was already an old man working at the Naval Yards when I was born in 1949. Ray as an infant. With his father. In front of Ebbets Field in miniature Dodger uniform, etc.My name\u0092s Ray Kinsella. Mom died when I was three, and I suppose Dad did the best he could. Instead of Mother Goose, I was put to bed at night to stories ofBabe Ruth, Lou Gehrig...and the great Shoeless Joe Jackson. Dad was a Yankees fan then, so of course I rooted for Brooklyn. But in '58 the Dodgers moved away, so we had to find other things to fight about. We did. And when it came time to go to college, I picked the farthest one from home I could find. Berkeley in the 1960s: hippies, protesters, etc.This, of course, drove him right up the wail, which I suppose was the point. Officially my major was English, but really it was the Sixties. Ray looking foolish in long hair and tie-dye.I marched, I smoked some grass, I tried to like sitar music... and I met Annie. Annie: blue jeans, T-shirt, freckles. Their courtship.The only thing we had in common was that she came from Iowa and I had once heard of Iowa. We moved in together. After graduation, we moved to the Midwest, and stayed with her family as long as we could. Unsmiling American Gothic types.Almost a full afternoon. The apartment, Ray at different jobs, the wedding.We rented an apartment and I took a job selling insurance. I also drove a cab and worked in a pizza parlor. Dad died in June of 1 74. Annie and I got married that fail. Baby pictures.A few years later Karin was born. She smelled weird, but we loved her anyway. Then Annie got the crazy idea that she could talk me into buying a farm.I'm thirty-eight years old and I'm about to become a farmer. I love my family, I love baseball, and I miss New York. Moving in on Ray's face.But until I heard The Voice...I'd never done a crazy thing in my whole life.That voice.Just now. Like an announcement. Annie confers briefly with Karin, then calls back to Ray.Oh. Ray thinks for a second, then shakes it off, trying to dislodge that thought from his mind, and gets back to work.Okay, you must've heard that.Was there like a sound truck on the highway, or something?Kids with a radio?Just one.More like a. . .ballpark announcer. Annie shoots him an \"Are you kidding?\" look. Ray responds with a shrug. They sit down to eat.'If you build. it, he will come.'Me too.Build what? For who?It's okay, honey, I'm just-talking to the cornfield. He sighs and goes back to bed. Annie cuddles up to him. Her eyes are closed, but Ray's eyes remain open. He is puzzled and concerned.Trust me, Karin, it's not funny. The man is sick. He's very sick. Annie enters, putting on her coat.Uh honey, I'll take her today. I'v-e got some errands in town.Take a message.In all those years, did you ever...No! No, I'm not. Really. But the people still stare. Ray addresses them.Noises! That darn tractor, it's... (forces a nervousAll right, who are you, and what the hell do you want from me?!? All he hears is a faraway echo.If you build it... As he thinks about these words,,some unexplained impulse causes Ray to turn his head deliberately toward a portion of the cornfield between him and the house.Ray's eyes widen.. he will come'..he will come.Annie...You're not going to believe this...Wait, this gets better, I just saw a vision.I swear to God. An actual vision.I know.I never took acid.Annie, there's more.I think I know what 'If you build it, he will come' means.I think it means if I build a baseball field out there, Shoeless Joe Jackson will get to come back and play ball again.Uh uh. She whistles. This is serious.Yeah.I know. It's totally nuts.Far as I know.Thank you. Annie smiles, but sees that Ray is troubled. She hugs him.Did you know Babe Ruth copied his swing?I always felt cheated I never got to see him play. He was supposed to be so graceful, and agile. So to actually get to see him play again...to let him play again, to right an old wrong... He shakes his head in wonder just to think of it. Annie turns on the light.No.I never forgave him for getting old. By the time he'was as old as I am now, he was ancient. He must have had dreams, but he never did anything about them. For all I know, he may have even heard voices, too, but he sure didn't listen to them. The man never did one spontaneous thing in all the years I knew him. Annie, I'm scared that that's what growing up means. I'm afraid of that happening to me. And something tells me this may be my last chance to do something about it. I want to build that field. Do you think I'm crazy? She looks at him with great understanding.Ty Cobb called him the greatest left fielder of all time. His glove was called 'the place where triples go to die.'Lifetime 356 average. Third highest in history. Karin whistles.When he was still in the minors, he bought a new pair of spikes and they hurt his feet. About the sixth inning he took them off and played the outfield in just his socks. The other players kidded him, called him Shoeless Joe, and the name stuck.Then in 1919, his team, the Chicago White Sox, threw the World Series.They lost it on purpose. Gamblers paid them to.Except Shoeless Joe.Nobody could prove anything one way or another, but he was the one guy who probably wasn't in on it.I mean if he was supposed to be throwing it, how do you explain the fact he hit 375 for the series and didn't commit one error? Huh?Twelve hits, including the series' only home run. And they said he was trying to lose!We'd better notify Mars to send us more money.That's his problem. And tell him to make it in Earth dollars this time. Ray hands over the check to the open-mouthed cashier.Thank you. Have a nice day. Ray and Annie turn and leave with Karin. The farmers watch, obviously trying hard to figure this one out.There's a famous story about when he came out of the courtroom, a kid ran up to him, tugged his sleeve and said 'Say it ain't so, Joe.' And Jackson looked down t him and said 'I'm afraid it is, kid.'The Commissioner of Baseball suspended eight of the players -- including the great Shoeless Joe Jackson -- for life.They never let him play the game again. They continue to work in silence.What. What!Yeah. What about it?At these prices, I'm not surprised.Thank you...thank you...My father said he saw him years later playing under a made-up name in some tenth-rate league in Carolina. He'd put on fifty pounds, and the spring was gone from his step, but he could still hit. Dad used to say no one could hit like Shoeless Joe. Ray is smiling wistfully.Careful... Moonl ight butters the Iowa night. They walk along the side of the field, and Ray stops. He looks at the field.I have just created something totally illogical.Am I completely nuts?It is kinda pretty, isn't it? Annie smiles at him and carries Karin inside. Ray steps onto the porch and flicks the switch shutting off the floodlights over the field.Something's going to happen out there. I can feel it. Annie lowers her head against his chest and goes back to sleep. Outside, the trees are fully leafed.A left-handed pitcher.Jesus.Just a minute, Karin.In a minute, Karin.How's the field play?Hi. The Man nods at him, takes the bat, and tests it to feel its weight.Ray Kinsella.I bet its good to be playing again, huh?Don't we need a catcher?I am pitching to Shoeless Joe Jackson. He makes a pitch. It's not a very good one, and Joe has to step across the plate to make contact, but his swing is graceful, compact and effortlessly powerful. He drives the ball against the fence. Ray watches it with wonder and when he turns back, Jackson is gesturing with the bat for him to make the next pitch. Ray makes the standard pitcher's gesture for a curve ball.See if you can hit my curve. \u00b0He goes into an elaborate windup, throws it, it does not curve much, and Jackson whistles it right by Ray's ear.Yes, he can hit the curve.You bet. Ray makes another pitch, and Jackson hits a line drive down the third base line. Then a smoker down the first base line. Ray is mightily impressed.Wow.Right, you were a low ball hitter.Yeah.My family. Jackson nods and then points to the floodlights.\"All the stadiums have them now except Wrigley Field.The owners found that more people could attend night games.Mr. Jackson: my wife Annie, my daughter Karin.Karin... She's just kidding.Yeah. I built this for you.Oh man, anytime. They're all welcome here. Joe looks out over the field in eager anticipation of the good times to come.Yeah. See you later.No. It's Iowa. Shoeless Joe Jackson nods and fades away as he walks through the door in the fence. Ray and Annie looks at each other in absolute wonder.We're keeping this field.Come on, it's so big. How can you lose something so big?Yeah, but it turned up two days later, didn't it?Thanks, Mark, but no.Hey; I know a lot more about farming than you think.Excuse us. He exits, carrying Karin. Mark shakes his head.Watch Joe. Watch his feet as the pitcher gets the sign and starts to pitch. A good left fielder knows what pitch is coming, and he can tell from the.angle of the bat where the ball's going to be hit. At the sharp crack of the bat Shoeless Joe whirls, takes five loping strides toward the fence, turns again', reaches up, and the ball smacks into his glove. Karin cheers. One of the players good-naturedly boos.Oh. Well, it was...you know, thanks for coming.I know. Mark just stands there for a moment, the only sounds coming from the players on the, field.Oh, I guess it's not really a game. It's more like a practice. Mark looks at his wife and Mother with concern. Ray doesn't understand this reaction.See, there's only eight of them, so they can't play a real game...Them. Now, Mother and Dee look as if they're about to go into mourning. Mark kneels next to Karin.Interesting. He and Annie sit beside Karin and watch the players. Each slowly starts to smile.You must keep in pretty good shape.No.Right. See you guys. The players call their \"good-byes\" to Ray and head for the door in the outfield fence. Ray watches them fade out as they go through the door. Then he takes a moment to look around him. The baseball diamond set in the cornfield is quite beautiful. Ray takes a satisfied breath, and walks back toward his house. He is the very picture of contentment. Then he hears The Voice.What? No response.I'm sorry. I didn't understand.What? No response.I'm sorry. I didn't understand.Whose pain? What pain? No response.Why me? But there is no response.He said...'Ease his pain.'I asked him. He wouldn't tell me.I don't think so.I don't think so.Hmm? Annie leads Ray inside.Annie... But Annie mistakes her husband's intentions. She thinks he is cautioning her not to get embroiled in trouble.I figured it out.I know whose pain I'm supposed to ease.I know whose pain I'm supposed to ease.Terence Mann.That's whose pain.I don't know. I just know. I was right about building the field, wasn't I?I don't know.I don't know. None of this questioning has dampened Ray's pride and excitement. Annie shakes her head.Annie.Annie, it's incredible.By the early Seventies, the guy decides people have become either too extremist or too apathetic to listen to him. So he stops writing books. He starts writing poetry. About whales and stuff. Then, he starts fooling around with a home computer, and gets hooked. Know what he does now? Annie shakes her head no.He writes software for interactive children's videos. They teach kids how to resolve conflicts peacefully. What an amazing guy..In the April 1962 issue of Jet Magazine, there's a story of his called 'This Is Not A Pipe.' Annie laughs at that. Ray is so excited, he laughs too.It's not his best work, but the hero of the story, a character that Mann created twenty-six years ago, is named John Kinsella. My father. She stops short.You drive.Okay. The last interview-he ever gave was in 1973. Guess what it's about.Annie, he was a baseball fanatic! Listen to this: He finds a page and reads from it:'As a child, my earliest recurring dream was to play at Ebbets Field with Jackie Robinson and the Brooklyn Dodgers. Of course, it never happened, and the Dodgers left Brooklyn, and they torn down Ebbets Field. But even now, I still dream that dream.'The man wrote the best books of his generation, he was a pioneer in the civil rights and anti-war movements, he made the cover of Newsweek, he knew everybody, he did everyting...he helped shape his time. He hung out with the Beatles! But in the end, it wasn't enough. What he missed ...was'baseball. Annie takes a look at Ray's handful of Xeroxes.What.Yes.No it's not. It's pretty weird, I grant you, but building the field was weirder. Five, ten percent weirder.Annie, this is really new territory for both of us, I know, but we're dealing with primal forces of nature, here. When primal forces of nature tell you to do something, the prudent thing is not to quibble over details and ---That's what I need to find out.I won't even stay in motels. I'll sleep in the car, and I'll beg for food.Annie, it's more than that. I know this- is nuts, but there's another reason I'm supposed to do it. I feel it. I feel it as strongly as I've ever felt anything in my life. There's a reason.I think something's going to happen at the game. I don't know what, but...there's something at Fenway Park in Boston, and I have to be there with Terence Mann to find it. Something he just said changes Annie's mood.Yeah.Uh, was I sitting on the first base side?About the fifth row?-- a hot dog. I had the same dream.The article says he has a storefront on Harvard Street next to some place that sells Kosher food. Shouldn't be too hard to find. I don't need a tie, doYou'll be okay, right?So long Tiger. He get into the car and looks up at Annie.I'll call you every night. If the team shows up while I'm gone, just tell them... On second thought, stay away from them. Those guys haven't been near a woman since 1922.They're jocks. Keep away from them.Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella. I'm really a big fan of...He lives right around here. Do you know him? I'm a friend of his. The Butcher just stares back, with suspicion.He's sort of a tall, black man.That's a good point. Thank you. Ray exits.Sir, my name is Ray Kinsella, and it's a great pleasure 'Co finally --- The door slams in his face. It takes Ray a few seconds to realize the interview is over. He rings the bell again. The door opens. Mann\u00b0s large frame fills it.Just one minute. I'm begging you. Mann looks him over. Then he sighs.Okay. I understand your desire for privacy, and i wouldn't dream of intruding if this weren't extremely important.This isn't a cause. I don't need money, or an endorsement.You once wrote: 'There comes a time when all the cosmic tumblers have clicked into place, and the universe opens itself up for a few seconds, to show you what is possible.'What.Well, actually ---Just wait a second --- Mann picks up an old-fashioned bug sprayer -- the kind with a long arm that pumps in and out -- and starts spraying it at Ray as if he were an unwanted insect.If you'd just ---You've changed, you know that?Okay, hold it right there. He juts his pocketed hand forward, as if he had a gun in his jacket.I was hoping I wouldn't have to do it this way...It's a gun. What'd you think it is?No it's not. It's a gun.Get out of here, I'm not going to show you my gun. Mann sighs, and stands.Now look. I'm not going to hurt you, I just need you to go with me for a little while, then -- what are you doing? Mann has found a crowbar among his tools, and is advancing toward Ray.Whoa! Wait! You can't do that.You're a pacifist! Mann stops. He thinks. He lowers the crowbar.Thank you.I'm sorry. I was hoping I could-just convince you to come with me.I have to take you to a baseball game.Tonight's game. Red.Sox, Twins.Something will happen there. I don't know what, but we'll find out when it does. Mann now has no idea what to make of all this, so he just looks Ray over for a few seconds.My name is Ray Kinsella. You used my father's name for a character in one of your stories. John Kinsella.I read an interview you gave a long time ago about how you always dreamed of playing at Ebbets Field, and how sad you felt when they tore it down.You didn't?This whole. thing is so weird.It's a long story...and I'll tell you on the way. Please.If you just come to this game with me, I'll never bother you again. Not even a Christmas card. Mann picks up a hat, .plops it on his head and heads out the door.No. It's my first time. So be gentle. Ray laughs nervously, and is embarrassed to see Mann not sharing the humor.You used to have a sense of humor.I'm sorry. This is really humiliating. Which way is-Eenway? Mann shakes his head, then tilts it to the left.Thank you.(no longer soCan I ask you a question? Something I've always wanted to know. Mann nods. He's been asked this question a million times.You never slept with who?How'd you get a name like Terence? Mann cannot believe that's the question.Oh no.Okay. I don't really have a gun. So don't say anything to this guy, okay? I swear to God there's a reason we're supposed to be at this game. Mann gives him a \"Give me a break\" look. Ray sees the Policeman is getting out of his cruiser and walking towards them. Ray is desperate.If I get arrested, the press'll be all over you, you'll have to appear in open court, you'll be the lead story on Entertainment Tonight, and your picture'll be on the front page of every tabloid in America. The Policeman knocks on Ray's window. He is young, fresh-scrubbed and earnest. Ray holds up one hand to him.Just a second.Sorry.Fenway Park! We're going to the ball game.'Entertainment Tonight, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo... Mann winces. The officer looks at him questioningly.Yes. I will. Thank you. The Policeman walks away, and Ray heaves a sigh of relief.'Terry?'Ray. My...hostages call me Ray. Can I call you Terry? Sourly, Mann nods. Ray smiles and drives off.And thank you.Then what else?Well, you want to hear something really crazy?Nope. I live on a farm in Iowa. One day, out in the cornfield, I heard a voice...Annie and Karin see it, too. They have reached the ticket window.Two, field level, first base side. The elderly Ticket Seller pulls out two tickets.It's on me.Great. They enter the stadium.So what do you do with yourself these days?Don't you miss being... involved?So...what do you want?No, I meant what do you want from... Ray points to the hot dog vendor, as they have reached the front of the line.Two.God, this place is so beautiful. The grass is so green you can almost smell it. Looking around the old ballpark, they see only about twenty or thirty die-hard fans in the stands for batting practice; a half-dozen players are grouped around the batting cage as one player hits to several others in the field. A few sportswriters and other civilians stand near the dugouts. Ray and Mann stop at the first row, right behind the Red Sox on-deck circle, lean on the railing and talk.It could be 1912 out there, for all this place has changed. Babe Ruth stood on that very mound as a pitcher long before anyone knew he could hit home runs. Same mound.Something.. about the game.Oh my God.Nothing.Yeah.If you want to go, we can go. Mann looks at Ray curiously, trying to read this new attitude.Home.I've taken up too much of your time. Mann gets out of the car.You'll think I'm crazy.It said 'The man's done enough. Leave him alone.' Ray puts the car in gear, makes a wide turn, and starts to head back up the street. But he stops short when Mann's form looks out of the darkness into the glare of the headlights.. Ray does not know why Mann is blocking his path. Or why he appears tense, almost frightened.You saw it.New York Giants, 1922. He played one game, never got to bat. Mann looks spectrial in the high-contrast glare on the headlights.Chisholm, Minnesota. We were the only ones who saw it. Did you hear the voice, too? Mann glances at Ray, then looks away.It's all right to admit it. That's what told me to find you. No response.Did you hear it too?Do you know what it means?What.What do we do when we find him?Annie, I'm really sorry, but I'm going to be a few days longer.Everything's great, and'I'll tell you all about it when I get back, but I'm going to Minnesota now.Hey, guess what? Terence Mann is with me. We're going to Minnesota together.I know. I gotta go. Hug Karin for me. I love you.Half a dozen Grahams...no Archibald, no Moonlight.No, I think his nickname was 'Moonlight.'It's nothing bad. We're not from the IRS, or anything ---That's very nice of you.You sound disappointed.Oh, My God. Ray hurries over to Mann, offering the opened newspaper, and points out an article to Mann. It is headlined:You want me to...? He motions outside with his head.Nominated? Ray now looks at the car parked nearest to him.The little hairs on the back of Ray's neck stand up. His mouth is dry, and for a moment, he cannot speak. Then, he calls to the man.Doctor Graham? Slowly, the man stops and turns back to face Ray. Ray starts to trot to him.My name is Ray Kinsella. I'm from Iowa. Are you Moonlight Graham? The old man narrows his bright eyes to see Ray more clearly.Well, I've come...Mind if i join you? I'd like to talk to you. Doc nods and they start to walk.Well, first of all, how'd you get to be called 'Moonlight'?Yeah, I know what you mean.When you got to the majors, you played only one inning of one game. What happened in that inning?Did you get to make a play? Doc takes a sheet of paper off his desk, expertly rips an inch or so off the corner with his teeth, and begins chewing.I was warned about you.And what was that like?I didn't really know till just now. But I think it's to ask you if you could do anything you wanted to...if you could have a wish...I don't know. I'm just asking... Doc leans his left elbow on the desk and rubs his forehead thoughtfully with a palm, as if it were an eraser that could erase the years and take him back to 1929 and the Polo Grounds in New York.What would you do if I said 'Yes'?There is a place where things like that happen. And if you want to go there, I can take you. Doc's eyes start to glisten, and he offers an embarrassed smile as he wipes away a tear.I understand, but I think you're supposed to come with us.But your wish...But sixty-five years ago -- for five minutes -- you came this close. (holds up twoAnd he smiled.And then I figured maybe we're not supposed to take him with us. So now I don't know why the hell we were supposed to come here.Did it?Okay, look. They can't foreclose for thirty days, or something like that. I've got to take Terry back to Boston first, so it'll be ---We're coming home.-Not everybody can see it. You might not.I need all the karma I can get right now. The car stops, and the Teenager runs for it. He tosses his dufflebag in the backseat and squeezes in after it.How far are you going?Iowa.This is your lucky day, kid. We're going someplace kind of like that.I'm Ray Kinsella, this is Terry Mann.Don't. He didn't get it till he was in the minors.Funny, the way he described towns, finding you a job so you can play on their team...they haven't done that for years. My Dad did that for a while. But that was in the Twenties.He never made it as ball player, so he tried to get his son to make it for him. By the time I was ten, playing baseball got to be like eating vegetables or taking out the garbage, so when I was fourteen, I started to refuse. Can you believe that? An American boy refusing to have a catch with his father.That's when I read The Boat Rocker, by Terence Mann.I never played catch with him again.I know. Anyway, when I was seventeen, we had a big fight, I packed my things, said something awful, and left. After a while I wanted to come home, but I didn't know how. I made it back for the funeral.I said I could never respect a man whose hero was a criminal.Shoeless Joe Jackson. Mann considers this all very carefully.I was seventeen. Mann nods with growing understanding.I know. I can't bring my father back..And this young fellow is Moon -- uh, Archie Graham. Karin and Annie shake his hand.He's come to practice with the team.What does that mean?Thanks, Joe. Good to see you.What.Well of course it is.You mean you still didn't believe me?Terry, I'd like you to meet Joe Jackson. Joe, this is Terry Mann. Mann and Jackson shake hands.I don't mind. Where'd they come from?It's more than that. It's perfect.Karin?So how do you score it?Very good.Look. Archie Graham -- now wearing a Giant's uniform -- drops one of the two bats he has been swinging in the on-deck circle, and advances on the plate, slashing the air with a brand-new bat the color of vanilla ice cream. He plants himself in the batter's b.ox, then cocks the bat, the top end of it trembling as if he were stirring something, and waits for the pitch.' The pitcher looks in for his signs. Archie stares back. As the pitcher goes into his windup, Archie winks at him. There is a moment of confusion and then anger on the pitcher's face, and when the ball speeds to the plate it is aimed right at Archie's head. He dives out of the way and hits the dirt hard. The Catcher chuckles through his mask.You can't leave the field any other way, can you?I'd love to go with you sometime. The silence that follows is long and ominous.I'd like to see what's out there. There is still no response.I'll take that as a no for now. He spots Archie jogging off the field.Hey, slugger, congratulations! Archie jogs over.Well come on, this calls for a drink.Good game, Archie.I know. You're welcome. Archie runs through the door in the fence and vanishes.And they own the paper, so they have the legal right to foreclose.Either way we lose the farm. Maybe we can make it a condition of the sale that they keep the field up.Fine. You can put in twenty bucks for groceries.More likely it's that you're supposed to start writing again. About this.You promise to publish and I'll let you chip in from your royalties. Mann's expression suddenly turns to one of indignation.I'm not sure I agree with that.That I won't argue with. Annie emerges from the house and calls to Ray.Whatever I have to do to save this place, I'll do.He's here. They look and see Mark's car heading up the gravel lane. He parks the car at the edge of the field, and the game stops as he walks right across it, completely mindless of the players. Since he doesn't see any of them, a few actually have to move out of his way. He approaches the bottom of the bleachers.You're interrupting the game, . Mark.It's not a fantasy, Mark. They're real. Mark obviously do.esn't see anyone on the field.Shoeless Joe Jackson. The White Sox. The Giants.As a matter of fact, it's Terence Mann.I'm not selling you my home.What about the baseball field?Over $2200 an acre.No deal, Mark. We're staying.Wait. They all turn to Karin.What people, sweetheart?I'm not signing. Mark shakes his head sadly. Annie hugs Ray. The players breathe a great sigh of relief. Mann smiles.You don't see those cars? All those people?Watch your language, Mark.Get your hands off her. Ray rises threateningly, and Mark turns toward him. In so doing, he twists little Karin off balance.Get the car.Karin... Then, without reason, Ray slowly turns toward the field. The White Sox stand near him by the fence, the Giants stay around their bench. All except one: young Archie Graham.She fell. Doc kneels beside her and instantly knows what is wrong.'Oh, my God, you can't go back.Okay.You mean it?Him?Wait a second. Why him? Shoeless Joe and the other players wait for Mann to join them, ignoring Ray's question.I built this field! You wouldn't be here if it weren't for me.But I want to know what's out there! I want to see it!Oh yeah? Why?What interview?Then you lied to me.So I do all the work, and all I get is to see everybody else's dreams come true. Is that it?I'm saying I'm happy for you, and I'm happy for him, but after all this what's in it L for me?Then you'll write about it?How you feeling, honey?Terry's been invited to go-with the players.We're keeping this field.What.. Shoeless Joe just keeps smiling.What're you grinning at, you ghost?Oh, my God.Its my father.Say it ain't so,- Joe.It was you.My God, I only saw him later, when he was worn down by life. Look at him. The young Catcher has reached the outfield grass. Ray walks down to the edge of the outfield.He has his whole life in front of him, and I'm not even a glint in his eye. What do I say to him?I'm Ray. My wife Annie. And this is my daughter, Karin.You catch a good game.It's Iowa.Is there a heaven?Then maybe this is heaven.Good night.Hey! John turns back. Ray is holding a ball.You wanna have a catch? John closes his eyes for a second, and when he opens them; there is the hint of moisture. Does he know Ray is his son?", "clean_line": "father john kinsella faded sepia shot dirty little kid farm irish born north dakota young man doughboy uniform saw big city came france chicago tenement

Come on. Dinner. Annie leads Karin inside.Nape.Nope. You really hearing voices?Ah. God?What'd it say?If you build what, who will come?Ooh, I hate it when that happens.Ray?Karin, if you're finished, get your coat and school bag. Let's go. Karin bolts from the table.Far out. She takes off her coat and kisses Ray as he takes-the car keys and heads outside. Annie sits at the kitchen table.What if the voice calls while you're gone?Right. He exits. She grins, turns on the TV and watches Harvey.Yo, Ray! Food!Hiya, cutie. Ray climbs up the steps, accepts her kiss, and instead of following her into the house, pulls her down with him onto the swing. He takes-her hand and looks into her eyes.You heard the voice again.Get out of here!We're going to have to burn you at the stake if this keeps up.Hey, you don't suppose this could be like an acid flashback, do you?Maybe you will someday, and it's a flash forward.You're subscribing to the Enquirer.Oooh, why do I not think this is a good thing?You're kidding.Boy, I thought my family was crazy, but this...this is the craziest thing I've ever heard.I mean, Shoeless Joe, he's...And he's the one they suspended, right?He still dead?You know what amazes me? No one could ever get you to believe in astrology, or ESP, or reincarnation, or heaven, or any of that stuff. But this...I think this shows real personal growth, Ray.Oh, sweetie. I hope you know that even though I make jokes, I'm going to visit you every month wherever they put you. He offers her a weak smile and exits.If I did, I'd forgotten it. Ray sits up in the dark.Wait a minute, Bosco. Are you actually thinking of doing this?What's your father got to do with this? Ray tries to picture his father in his mind. He speaks softly, but the words obviously have a great deal of meaning for him.Yes. He smiles wanly. She touches his face lovingly.I also think that if you feel you really have to do this... then you should do it. They hold each other's gaze, and Ray cannot remember when he has loved her so much. He takes her in his arms. Outside their window, the field of corn lies waiting.That's the first time I've ever seen you smile as you mentioned your father. Ray considers that.Come on, you. Bed time. Annie hoists Karin on her shoulders with a grunt, and the three climb their way down the bleachers. Ray's hand steadies Annie as she takes one of the steps.That's what I like about it.Not completely. She looks out over the baseball field.It's a good baseball field, Ray.Any sign?Well, given how much less acreage we have for corn, I'd say we'll probably .almost break even.We've spent all our savings on that field.We'll put up some coffee. You go ahead. Ray takes a breath and steps out onto the veranda. The night sky seems close enough to touch.Would you like to come inside'?Where's he going?Since when is there a door in the fence?You bet your ass we are.You misplaced the house once.What???He doesn't drink, and he doesn't beat me, okay? Now I'll grant you, he has gotten me to worship Satan with him, but just a little. Her mother gasps.Kidding... I'm kidding! Her family has no sense of humor about this whatsoever.I think we need more cheese. She goes into the kitchen, and when she has rounded the corner, she raises her eyes to heaven and mutters:Families.Ray? Mom's leaving.You don't see it?They couldn't see it.Ray! Dinner!Come on, wash up. We've got a PTA meeting after dinner. They're talking about banning books again. Really subversive books like, Wizard of Oz, Diary of Anne Frank --- She notices Ray is strangely silent.What happened to you?Oh Lord, you don't have to build a football field now, do you?Ease whose pain?Shoeless Joe's?One of the other players?This is a very non-specific voice you've got out there, Ray, and he's really starting to piss me off. Ray nods as Annie serves the meal in silence.Fascist. I'd like to ease her pain. Ray is still lost in thought.I read it four times. Funniest book I ever read.No. I think you had two Fifties, and moved right on to the Seventies.Now there's an intelligent response.All right Beulah, you wanna step outside?!? Huh? The other woman takes a half-step backward. No one has ever seen sweet Annie like this.I got a better idea. Let's put it to a vote. Come on! Who's for Eva Braunhere? Who wants to burn books? Who wants to piss on the Constitution of the United Sates? Anybody? The majority who had sided with the book-banner wants to vote for censorship, but under these terms just can't raise their arms. Little Annie is on a roll, now.All right. Now: who's for The Bill of Rights? Come on...who thinks freedom's a pretty good thing? Let's see those hands. Some people start raising their hands.Who thinks we have to stand up to the kind of censorship they have in Russia? Reluctantly, just about everyone raises their hands. Annie is thrilled.There you go. All right, America! I'm proud of you. I mean it. You're beautiful!We gotta go. Ray pulls her from the room. Each is proud as hell, each for a different reason.Oh Ray, was that great, or what? it was like the Sixties again.Ray, I just halted the spread of neo-facism in America, and you're talking about ---What about him?How do you know that?What's his pain?Then how are you supposed to ease it?Ray...(tries to putRight. So what's it got to do with baseball?-Wow. He gives her a \"See? What'd I tell you?\" look.What can I say... Big wow, but..what's it got to do with baseball? They are standing by their car.Mmm. Some kind of team sport?That's sad...Oh my God!Sorry.So to ease his pain, you have to take him to a ball game?Ray, this is nuttier than building the field.I'm sorry, pal, but I have to nip this one in the bud. We are having moderate to heavy financial difficulties here. You cannot take off for Boston while you're going broke in Iowa.(starting to getRay, we're behind on the mortgage. That field ate up our savings. We could lose the farm.No. This is too much.- I understand your need to prove to the world you're not turning into your father, but you've done it! You believed in the magic, and it came true. Isn't that enough?What. Just tell me what it is.Fenway Park... Is that the one with the big green wall in left field?I dreamt last night you were at Fenway.Yes...(nods,I'll help you pack..you take that to 93, and then it gets all squiggly, and after that you're on your own. How are you going to find him, anyway? He won't exactly be in the phone book, you know.No, dear. Not for a kidnapping.I'll try to sell the combine. We sure don't need it anymore. Karin runs up, grabs Ray behind each ear and hugs and kisses him.Ray, they're not going to make a pass at me. They're'ghosts.For the same reason I've never pissed on your birthday cake.Ray.Welcome.He'll be able to do more than just practice.Come on. They walk towards the field.Let's enjoy this place while we still have it.Once we fell behind in the payments, the full amount of the mortgage became due.Unless we sell.Forget it. They're buying up single farms all around us, make it one big farm. First thing they'll do is plow under your field. Ray just sits there, letting that sink in.Honey, that was Mark. He's coming tonight. He needs a decision tonight.Everything is so perfect here.I know. Suddenly, Ray snaps his head to the side, as one does to pick up a-distant sound.Yes.She's talking about people seeing their memories... touching their past.It'll be like one of those tiny, French restaurants that have no sign. You find it by instinct. They'll be drawn.We all can.Should we move her?Is there a doctor? A nurse? Any of you? They sadly shake their heads no. Annie races inside.There's hope for you yet, Mark.You mean 'out'?You go inside and lie down. I'll explain later. Mark walks off toward the people in their cars outside the house.You bet your ass we are. Ray realizes Shoeless Joe is staring at him, with a shit-eating grin on his face.What is it?Introduce him to his granddaughter. Ray cannot believe how wonderful Annie is. The Catcher has reached the edge of the field, and now stands before Ray and Annie.We're going to let you two talk. I have to go look after our guests. Someone's gotta start collecting admission if we're going to keep this place.

That was me. I'd wake up in the night with the smell of the ballpark in my nose and the cool of the grass on my feet. The thrill of the grass... He has found the bat he likes.Can you pitch?Not if you can get it near the plate, we don't. Ray smiles, takes a breath and starts his windup, during which he says aloud to himself:Stick with fast balls, kid.Damn, this feels good. Put it right here, huh? Joe holds the bat out low over the plate and Ray pitches it reasonably close to that spot. Jackson hits it out of the park, and beams. Ray brightens up with remembrance.Oh man, I did love this game. You know, I'd have played for food money. it was the game, the sounds, the smells. You ever held a glove or a ball to your face? Ray smiles as he walks in from the mound.And it was riding the trains from town to town. And the hotels with brass spittoons in the lobbies and brass beds in the rooms. And it was the crowd getting to their feet when the ball was hit deep. Shoot, I'd have played for free. The sound of a screen door turns their. attention to the house. Annie and Karin are coming out to them.What's with the lights?Makes it harder to see the ball.Joe. Ma'm...It's okay.Then I guess I'm real.Uh, thanks, but...I don't think I can. Ray and Annie look at Joe for a moment, not quite understanding the ground rules here. Joe senses their discomfort and changes the subject.Hey, can I come back again?There are others, you know. There were eight of us. It'd sure mean a lot to them.Thank you, Ray. I appreciate it. See you later, huh?Hey! Is this heaven?Come on, fellas. Let's hit the showers.Hi, Ray, welcome back.Pleasure's mine.With a couple of Cardinals and A's thrown in for good measure. Ty Cobb wanted to play, but none of us could stand the sonofabitch when we were alive, so we told him to stuff it.What the hell you doing on the sidelines? You came here to play ball, didn't you?Go warm up!We dream.Not if we want to come back.Hev rookie! Doc Graham turns.You were good. Only now do Doc Graham's eyes shine with tears. He smiles, and disappears through the door.We're gonna call it a night. We'll see you tomorrow.Hey! You wanna come with us? Ray's jaw drops.Not you. Him.Out there.Come find out.What are you saying, Ray?Is that why you did this? For-you?'If you build it... He nods toward where the catcher is taking off his gear at home plate.' .he will come.' Ray looks at the Catcher. The hairs on the back of his neck begin to stand up.I'm afraid it is, kid. The Catcher is now walking toward Ray.'Go the distance.'

It is Sunday afternoon, and Annie's family is visiting. her mother, pink-faced and white-dentured, sits ramrod straight in an antique rocking chair. Also present are her brother, Mark, and his wife Dee.Ray, this stupid baseball field is going to bankrupt you. Everybody knows it. All I'm saying is if you wait till you default on your loan, you lose everything. Sell now, my partners'llgive you a more than a fair price and you walk away with a nest egg.What are you holding on to this place for? You've never even liked Iowa. You don't like farming, you don't know the first thing about it ---How could you plow under your major crop?I don't believe this guy. I'm trying to bail him out and he goes off to watch television. Annie stifles a laugh.He used to be so normal.He's drinking, right?Think about what I said. I just want to help.I thought you two were going to watch some game.Eight of what? Ray points to the noisy players on the field.Karin honey... what are you watching?Do you see any baseball men right now?Why didn't you tell him?Annie, you don't have a choice in the matter. Annie looks vertroubldye.Ray, it's time'to put away our little fantasies and come down to earth.And who's that? Babe Ruth? Ray smiles, savoring the moment.Ah, how do you? I'm Michael Jackson.You have no money, you've got a stack of bills to choke a pig, and come fall, you've got no crop to sell. But I have a deal to offer you that will allow you to stay on this land. This has Ray's attention. Mark climbs the bleachers to stand closer to him.Let us buy you out, and we'll leave the house. You can live in it rent free as long as you want.Do you realize what this land is worth?Then you must realize we cannot keep a useless baseball diamond in the middle of rich farmland.Karin, please!You're not listening to this seriously, are you?Why would anybody pay money to come here? Karin looks at her Uncle mark as if he were a simpleton.What the hell is she talking about?Okay, this is all fascinating, but the fact remains that you don't have the money to bring the mortgage up to date, so you still have to sell. I'm sorry, but you have no choice. He produces a document and hands it to Ray with a pen. Ray looks at it. He doesn't know what to do.Just sign the papers, Ray.Listen to me. Tomorrow morning, when the bank opens, they will foreclose.You're broke, Ray. Sell now or lose everything.Ray. You will lose everything and you will be evicted. Ray looks at the paper with dread. He looks at Shoeless Joe and the players. He looks at his family. Then he turns back to Mark. It's decision time.Don't do this, you son of a bitch! There's no cars, no people...You're crazy. You're all bat-shit crazy!You build a baseball field in the middle of nowhere, you sit around here and stare at nothing ---And you've turned your daughter into a goddamn moron!I'm trying to help you, goddamnit! In that split second, they hear a strangled gasp, and see Karin falling forward from the top row of the bleachers.Oh my God, I'm sorry...Annie...I didn't mean to... Karin is unconscious, and seems to be fighting for breath. Ray and Annie's eyes meet in anguish.I saw...A11 of a sudden this kid runs off the field and turns.into...He just...

He is backing Ray out the door.There's no place for you here in the future! Get back while you still can! He gets Ray just past the door and slams it shut. Ray slams it open. He's pissed.Yes. I suppose I have. How's this? 'Peace, love, dope.'Now you've pissed me off.What the fuck is that?It's your finger.Yeah? Let me see it.I'm going to beat you with a crowbar till you go away. Understandably, this makes Ray nervous.Shit. Ray breathes a sigh of relief.All right, are you kidnapping me? What's the deal here?Then you are kidnapping me.You what?Why?You're seeing a team of psychiatrists, aren't you?Then why are you kidnapping me to a baseball game?I never said that.I don't even remember thinking it. Now Ray is ndt sure what to do.Then why go through with it?I'm not going to get rid of you, am I?You do this often?Things used to be funny. Ray pulls up at an intersection. He has to choose between left and right. Behind him, cars are honking. Ray doesn't have a clue which way to go. He sighs.You're really inept at this, aren't you? Ray grins sheepishly and nods. Mann laughs.I mean you're like a total bumbler. Ray chuckles his reluctant acceptance of the truth.'Bozo the Kidnapper.No, I never slept with her.Whoever you were going to ask me about. If I'd been with one-tenth the famous women they said I was with, I'd be in formaldehyde by now.Rastus was taken.Nice going, Boze.Terry.Actually, Officer, I'm being kidnapped. Discreetly, under his breath, Ray sings the \"Entertainment Tonight\" theme song.'Raymond?'I didn't do it just because I don't want the publicity.I envy you your craziness, Ray. It's been years since I did something completely crazy.Do I have a choice?You're damn right it is. Ray pays the man and receives the tickets.I live. I work. I've learned to cook. I take walks. I watch sunsets.Oh.I haven't published a word in seventeen years and I still have to endure assholes like you all the time. What do you think it'd be like if I suddenly came out with a new book?They'd bleed me dry.Why are we here, Ray?What's the matter?You okay? Ray sighs.What???Then let's go. Mann rises and heads up the aisle. Ray looks down at the program -- at the handwritten legend of Moonlight Graham, who played one game fifty-seven years ago, but did not get to bat -- and follows Mann out of the ballpark.Where are you goingfrom here?What is it you're not telling me?I wish I had your passion, Ray. However misdirected it may be, it's still a passion. I used to feel that way about things, but...You got another message, didn't you?I already think you're crazy. What did it say? After a little thought, Ray smiles sadly.'Moonlight' Graham. Ray's jaw drops.Saw what?'Go the distance.'Yes.It means...we're going to Minnesota to find Moonlight Graham.Yeah.We'll know that when we find him. Ray opens the passenger door of the Datsun and Mann jumps in. Ray releases the brake and peels out, burning rubber. The two men look happy as kids with bats over shoulders, gloves dangling, on their way to a sandlot.Follow me.We're trying to find an ex-baseball player named Archibald Graham.Doctor Graham. This is interesting news to Ray and Mann.Do you know where we can find him?You wrote that.You're a good writer. The compliment is just right, and she smiles warmly.Something's missing. Ray is looking at a photo of Doc Graham as a man in his late sixties.Half the towns in North America has a Doc Graham. What makes this one so special we have to come halfway across the country to find him fifteen years after he died? There's got to be more. Veda enters with a piece of paper from a yellow legal pad.What was the umbrella for?Tell me about his wife.No screwing, no drinking, no opium, no illegitimate children. No-midnight abortions, no shady finances. Ray puts down his notes and picks up the Chicago Tribune.Shoeless Joe had a problem. That's why he needed you. This guy doesn't need us. Suddenly, Ray straightens with a start.Damn.What the hell do I tell him.Thanks. Ray exits.Maybe it was to find out if one inning can change the world.It did for these people. If he'd gotten a hit, he might've stayed there.No. Ray looks over at Mann.I'm going to Iowa with you.Hell, I couldn't quit now. I've got see this ballpark.I'll give it a try. As they turn onto the highway near the lake, a Teenager with a dufflebag appears on the side of the road, his arm raised in. a hitchhiker's stance. Ray pulls the car over to the side of the road.I'm dying to ask him if he has a nickname.Maybe we can give it to him.What happened to your father?Why at fourteen?Oh God.What was the awful thing you said?Who was his hero?You knew he wasn't a criminal. Ray nods.Then why'd you say it?So this is your penance..so the least you can do is bring back his hero. Ray nods.Well now we know what everybody's purpose here is...except mine. Ray looks at him. He hadn't thought of that. After a few moments Ray points to something in the distance.Terry.Thank you.Oh my Lord.That's Shoeless Joe Jackson!I've seen pictures. Those are the White Sox!I thought I did, but... Oh my Lord. They have reached the foul line where Shoeless Joe waits for them.It's a pleasure to meet you.Unbelievable.Does he get a hit for that?You better sit here. Karin beams. Ray taps Mann and points to the plate.Where do you go when you walk through that door? What do you do?Good night, kid. Ray, Karin, Annie and Mann watch Archie jog towards the rest of the players. When he reaches the fence, he turns back to them.I don't have a lot of money, Ray, but maybe I could pitch in a little.That's not what I meant. Maybe the reason you were supposed to find me was so I could help you with this.Don't change the subject.One thing has nothing to do with the other.You're not only stubborn, you're stupid.Ray... Ray looks at Mann.People will come, Ray. They'll come to Iowa for reasons they can't even fathom. They'll turn up your driveway, not knowing for sure why they're doing it, and arrive at your door, innocent as children, longing for the past. 'Of course we won't mind if you look around,' you'll say. 'It's only twenty dollars per person.' And they'll pass over the money without even looking at it. For it is money they have, and peace they lack.They'll walk out to the bleachers and sit in shirtsleeves in the perfect evening, or they'll find they have reserved seats somewhere in the grandstand or along one of the baselines -- wherever they sat when they were children and cheered their heroes. They'll watch the game, and it will be as if they'd dipped themselves in magic waters. The memories will be so thick they'll have to brush them away from their faces.People will come, Ray.The one constant through all the years, Ray, has been baseball. America has rolled by like an`army of steamrollers. It's been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt, and erased again. But baseball has marked the time. This field, this \u00b0 game... it's a piece of our past. It reminds us of all that once was good. And that could be again. People will come. People will most definitely come. Mann has moved everyone with the beauty of his words, and the passion in his.voice. Behind him, the assembled ballplayers respectfully applaud.Ray... Ray looks up at Mann, who, with a gentle tilt of the head, directs Ray's attention to the house. Ray looks behind him toward the house.How long?Good night. Joe starts to trot off the field, then he stops and turns back to the bleachers.Come with you?What is out there?Ray, for God's sake, I'm unattached. You've got a family. This takes Ray down a peg or two.There's a reason they chose me, just as there was a reason they chose you to find me.Because, you big jerk, I gave that interview.The one about Ebbets Field. The one that charged you up and sent you all the way to Boston to find me.You were kidnapping me at the time, you asshole! Think of it, Ray: maybe there's an Ebbets Field still floating around out there somewhere. And maybe I'll get to sit in the stands, and watch a twenty-year-old kid with a smooth face and kinky hair try out for the 1948 Dodgers.There's something out there for me, Ray. And what a story it'll make: a man being able to touch the perfect dream.You bet I will. Annie walks Karin over. Ray bends down to Karin's face.-You take care of this family, Ray.
