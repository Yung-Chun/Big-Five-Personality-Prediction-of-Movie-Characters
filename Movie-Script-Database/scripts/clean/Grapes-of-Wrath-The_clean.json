You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?Naw--not much!Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all. See that road up ahead?That's where I get off.You're about to bust to know what I done, ain't you? Well, I ain't a guy to let you down. Homicide!Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I hadn't tol' you.Howdy.Yeah. On my way home now.Why, you're the preacher!Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.I never let one go by me when I could catch her.Have a little snort?Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.I been in the penitentiary for four years.I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!Just around that next bend.That's our place.They're all gone--or dead.No. They wasn't people to write.This was Ma's. Had 'em for years.This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away. You reckon they could be dead?Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?I know that! But *where* they gone?This is Muley Graves. You remember the preacher, don't you?All right, you remember the *man* then.Now where is my folks?But what's happened? How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.But who done it?Are you crazy?That's what I asked you, ain't it?Well?But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!What I can't understand is my folks takin' it! Like ma! I seen her nearly beat a peddler to death with a live chicken. She aimed to go for him with an ax she had in the other hand but she got mixed up and forgot which hand was which and when she got through with that peddler all she had left was two chicken legs.She's settlin'.It's hard to say. Stay here till mornin' an' then go on over to Uncle John's, I reckon. After that I don't know.Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.Won't they come out here?Anybody ever 'tol me I'd be hidin' out on my own place...!No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.I'd a found you, Ma.Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?Mad, Ma?No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.Parole.Rosasharn! Hi, Rosasharn! Howya, Al!Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up.Naw. They paroled me.If this don't beat all! Well, I see you been busy already!How you get all this money?Easy. After all, they ain't but about *twelve* of us, is they?How about it, Ma?Think she'll hold?What's the matter, Grampa?How 'bout Granma?Ma. Pa. Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt.Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.Ain't no whisky, is they?Don't taste bad.That's right. And douse some in it.California, here we come!'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt. Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.Casy, won't you say a few words?We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.Yes'm, that was it.Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.Forget it, Ma. Jus' think about the nice things out there. Think about them grapes and oranges--an' ever'body got work--First gas station, Granma--Awright! Awright!They shore don't waste no time! Take her out.We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--She's kinda ol'--Till the tractors druv us out.What's so funny about it?Wait a minute, buddy.

Is that the truth for us?Well, ask right. You ain't talkin' to bums, you know.California.No longer'n we can get acrost her.No plants.Sure. We aim to.Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.She's jus' wore out, that's all.Never seen such tough mountains. This here's a murder country, just the *bones* of a country. Wonder if we'll ever get in a place where folks can live 'thout fightin' hard scrabble an' rock. Sometimes you get to thinkin' they *ain't* no such country.Dunno. We ain't tried none. Sure feels good to set here, though.She ain't our river. But we'll len' you a little piece of her.Where's home?Me an' you both.Uncle John don't talk much but when he does he shore talks sense.What you mean?You been acrost?If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do.People done it. If they could, we could.Well, we ain't out a it yet.What's this here?No.Okay, cap. Much oblige.Where's Ma? I want Ma to see it. Look, Ma! Come here, Ma!Ma, you sick?Look, Ma!Didn' you get no sleep?Was Granma bad?When?An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?Right here. We give out a gas.Where's the bes' place to get some work aroun' here? Don't matter what kin' either.Sallisaw.She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.You got nothin' on him.I ain't gonna run.You're right!Hey, Al!We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John?Fella tells me some a them poolroom boys figgerin' to burn the whole camp out tonight. Got to get that truck loaded--what you doin' with the jack-handle, Ma?Awright, you can fight it out later. Right now we got to hustle. Where's Connie?Cut it out, Pa. He'p Al with the truck. Don't fret, honey. You goin' to be awright.Maybe he'll be back. We'll leave word for him. Jus' don't cry.Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.Give 'im a fryin' pan.Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.What's that--detour?Well-- --we're strangers here. We heard about they's work in a place called Tulare.Which way is it at, mister?Yes, sir.Fella tells me they's three hunerd thousan' aroun' here like us, a- scrabblin' for work an' livin' like hogs. Can't figger what it is, but *sump'n's* wrong.Morning.Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.We can pick anything.Mister, we sure that ya!Get some sugar too, for the coffee.Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches.Sure do.What's the matter? What's happened?I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it. An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.Sure, but what is this?Joad.Four.Two.Two.Why, I guess so.Joad. Say, what is this here?They sure do want to make us feel at home all right.It's still Joad.Got any more, Ma?I ain't full.Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.Okay. I be back a little later.Okay, Ma. Don't you worry.Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?You mean I can't even get outa here?I'll walk back.Evenin'.Jus' goin' pas', that's all.No. Jus' goin' pas', I tell you.Casy! What you doin' here?Thought you was in jail.Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about?Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.Sure. We made a buck since midday.I dunno. Payin' five now.I aim to.I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here.Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?I kinda thought so. Felt like it.They killed Casy first.They know what--this fella looks like?I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.Full up. Uncle John come through with five bucks he been hol'in' out on us since we lef' home.She's hotter'n a heifer.Picks a nice place for it, too, don't she?Any gas?Well, looks like we done it this time awright!Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it?Don't know--but it's better'n this.Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.You're tootin' we're gonna stay.Joad. Tom Joad.We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?An' you say no cops?I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.You got dances too?Say, who runs this place?Why ain't they more like it?Anything like work aroun' here?Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.Crate fell on me.Goodnight.Good mornin'.If this don't feel good!Seems like a nice frien'ly fella to work for, too.Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.Yes, sir.Listen. What *is* these reds? Ever'time you turn aroun' somebody sayin' somebody else's a red. What is these reds, anyway?But why? Those fellas ain't botherin' nobody.Ain't gonna be no trouble.Yes, sir.Ain't gonna get outa han'.She's gettin' prettier, Ma.Excuse me, Ma.I didn't know, Ma. I didn't know if I ought.Come outside.They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya-- --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But-- --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it. But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.Me neither. It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by.Sure.

But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em! But not no more. I lost the sperit.I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls. I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes! So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food-- --but my heart ain't in it. Nice drinkin' liquor.Been out travelin' around?No, I never. What?Excuse me for asking.And you ain't ashamed?Ain't you seen your folks since then?It don't matter. Ever since I lost the sperit it looks like I just as soon go one way as the other. I'll go your way.I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.Is it fur?Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist.And it ain't any too close, either! We better run!They never wrote you nothing?I never heard nothin' about it.I ain't no preacher anymore.No. You're lonely--but you ain't touched.What you figger to do?Come on, Tom. You're on parole.If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.Good-by, an' good luck.I'd like to. There's somethin' happenin' out there in the wes' an' I'd like to try to learn what it is. If you feel you got the room...I ain't no more a preacher, you know.I'll say 'em--an' make it short. This here ol' man jus' lived a life an' jus' died out of it. I don't know whether he was good or bad, an' it don't matter much. Heard a fella say a poem once, an' he says, \"All that lives is holy.\" But I wouldn't pray for jus' a ol' man that's dead, because he's awright. If I was to pray I'd pray for the folks that's alive an' don't know which way to turn. Grampa here, he ain't got no more trouble like that. He's got his job all cut out for 'im--so cover 'im up and let 'im get to it.He's tellin' the truth awright. The truth for him. He wasn't makin' nothin' up.I don't know.Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?Hide in the willows. If it's awright to come back I'll give you four high whistles.Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'.*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know. An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.Sure. Why not?This man a yours, he got tough an' I hit him. Then he started shootin'-- hit a woman down the line--so I hit him again.I talked back.They's a woman down there like to bleed to death from his bad shootin'.It was me, all right. You just got smart with the wrong fella.What's the matter?Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?No, I done my time an' got out. Come on in.This is him. What you doin' here, Tommy?Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids... So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five?I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?Well--tell the folks inside how it is, Tom. Tell 'em they're starvin' us and stabbin' theirself in the back. An' as sure as God made little apples it's goin' back to two an' a half jus' as soon as they clear us out.Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.Got to learn, like I'm a-learnin'. Don't know it right yet myself, but I'm tryin' to fin' out. That's why I can't ever be a preacher again.

But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy. Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?Sometimes they do.Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?Thank God. I--I don't want no mean sonI'm ready.Rosasharn honey! Wake up the chillun. We're fixin' to leave.But who'd cook for you? How'd you live?Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here. It put the chillun to sleep.And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...Got some saved for you, Grampa. Got 'em warmin' now. Here's a cuppa coffee.We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.Tommy.Wasn't that the state line we just passed?Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n-- --I'll do it.No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that. That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.Don't you worry, Granma. It's gonna be awright.Don't you fret now.'S awright, honey. Everything's gonna be awright.We can't give up, honey. The family's got to get acrost. You know that.Yes, ever'thing's all right. I--I guess I dropped off to sleep.Look, mister. We got a sick ol' lady. We got to get her to a doctor. We can't wait. You can't make us wait!I swear we ain't got anything. I swear it. An' Granma's awful sick. Look!No, I swear it.Tell Tom he don't have to stop. Granma's all right.Ya say we're acrost?Thank God! An' we're still together-- most of us.No.Granma's dead.Since before they stopped us las' night.I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.So it's all right. At leas' she'll get buried in a nice green place. Trees and flowers aroun'. She got to lay her head down in California after all.On a gallon a gas? Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.You want to get ast to eat, hunh?Didn' you have no breakfast?Didn' none of these have no breakfast?Then you ain't hungry, are you?Well, it's a good thing *some* a you ain't hungry, because they ain't enough to go all the way roun'.Go get Tom an' Al. I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here?We can't send 'em away. Take your plates an' go inside. Take a plate to Rosasharn. Look. You little fellas go an' get you each a flat stick an' I'll put what's lef' for you. But they ain't to be no fightin'! I don't know if I'm doin' right or not but--go inside, ever'body stay inside. They ain't enough. All you gonna get is jus' a taste but--I can't help it, I can't keep it from you.I done fine! Now nobody got enough!You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away. An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.But ef you *do* whup me, I swear you better not ever go to sleep again, because the minute you go to sleep, or you're settin' down, or your back's turned, I'm gonna knock you belly-up with a bucket.Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!Well, you ain't a-goin'! Ain't *nobody* else a-goin'! We *got* here an' we gonna *stay* here, together! As long as we got the fambly unbroke I ain't scared, but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us-- --an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore I'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!Connie's gone. Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.Pa! Shh!Maybe that's jus' what he done.Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.You promised, Tommy.You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.Don't you min', Tommy. You done good. You done jus' good.Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that... An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.You know, I jus' can't remember when I felt so good before!Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.Six. All y'all go. Me an' Rosasharn'll unload.No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.They charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place.Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty.You be careful, Tommy. Don't you be stickin' your nose in anything.Anybody ask anything?Stand by the door.How's it feel, Tommy?Looks like you done it.Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.They know he got hit in the face.It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us. They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn-- --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.Comes night we'll get outa here.It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.We got a job offered--good job.You done good, Al. Just good.Don't matter. Just got to go--an' keep a-goin', till we get plenty a distance away from here.I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?What is it?What's that?You mean you got *washtubs?* An' runnin' water?You don't look so good.Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.No--an' look what I got for you.I used to wear these--when your pa come callin' on me. You'll look pretty in 'em tonight.Thank you kin'ly but she ain't well.Maybe you wouldn't think it, but your pa was as nice a dancer as I ever seen, when he was young. Kinda makes me think a ol' times.Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.Ain't you gonna tell me goodbye, Tommy?It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.I could hide you, Tommy.Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?He was a good man.Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?Then what, Tom?I don't understan' it, Tom.Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?Good-by, Tommy.I'll get Rosasharn.Try to be strong, honey. Someday it'll be diff'rent--someday you'll have another one. You're still jus' a little girl, remember.She'll be awright.Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more. I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us.
