{"Twilight-New-Moon": {"BELLA": {"raw_line": "\"These violent delights have violent ends...\"\"... And in their triumph die, like fire and powder...\"\"... Which, as they kiss, consume...\"Edward!Edward!... Gran?Stop - she'll see!Oh my God.Dad, we agreed, no gifts.Okay, this is actually kind of great. Thanks, Dad.Not that old.So not funny, Dad.It was just a dream... but also my worst nightmare.I can help you with it -- but first -- I need a picture. My mom's expecting a scrapbook full of memories.You do today.Don't remind me.Not for me.It's one year older than you.True. Maybe I should be creeped out that I'm dating such an old guy.Right. Class.God, Jacob, what are they feeding you on that rez, steroids? You're huge.I will, soon. But isn't your school, like, ten miles that way?This, I need. It's great.Bye, Jake, and thank you.He's just a friend.Stop reading his mind if he bothers you so much.Shh!Alice, didn't I say no gifts?You had a vision about my birthday.... My party?I... guess I can deal --Wait, Jasper, no fair with the mood control.I hate being... celebrated.Juliet's alright... if you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.Why would you even think about that?It wouldn't have been your fault --What plan?The who?Is that... Carlisle?Of what?Don't even -- talk about that. You can't let anyone hurt you. The Volturi or anyone else.You said there were more dangerous things out there than you. And I know you have at least one enemy --You said she'd come after you for killing her mate.I hate that I can't protect you.That was me being serious.Alice, I'm the only one who even eats cake. That thing could feed fifty.Um... thanks?No hating on the truck. Thank you, Emmett.Ouch - paper cut.I sure can kill a party.Seems like you're the only one it doesn't effect.Did you ever think of... living differently?Damned? You're not damned.That's why he won't... He thinks he'd be damning me.Say something.That I'm a klutz. That I should have been more careful --Stop. I don't want normal, I want you.You can't protect me from everything - something's going to separate us -- accident, illness, old age... as long as I'm human...Your giving me forever.Carlisle told me how you feel, about my soul, but I don't believe that --I'll leave my window open for you.Then... can I ask for one thing? It's still my birthday. Kiss me?Edward. You're here.What? Why?But... when?I'll have to think of something to tell Charlie, but I can be ready --What? -- no -- Edward, what happened with Jasper - that was nothing.-- I belong with you ---- I'm coming --You don't... want me.Anything.I... yes... I will.No, this is - don't do this. Please. He sees she won't let go easily. Takes a breath. His face turns cold again.Then take my soul. I don't care! I don't want it without you ---- Wait --Edward?!He's... gone.Dear Mom... I'm... ... lost...Edward took everything with him. Including my life. He promised it would be like he never existed...... But I need to know he did.It's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest...But the pain is my only reminder that he was real... that they all were...I miss them. Especially Alice...But I'm sure it's better for them, not having me around...Time passes. Every tick that goes by... aches...Like the pulse of blood behind a bruise...That's what?What? Why?I'm not leaving Forks.I like my old friends.I do, too. In fact, I'm... um... Jessica and I are going to Port Angeles tomorrow. Shopping.That's how good a friend I am.Hi Jessica, it's Bella...... Yes, Bella Swan. Hey, any chance you feel like shopping tomorrow?I don't get why are there so many zombie movies.I bought something.I've been kind of... out of it.I know them... I think...I want to see something.... You're not them.I can break promises, too.... WaitStop - stop! - STOP!I... saw something.The more dangerous... the more real it was.He wasn't real. I knew that. I didn't care. I needed to see him. If danger's what it took, that's what I'd find.I brought you something.I rescued them from the dump. They'd cost more than they're worth to fix... unless one had a mechanic-type friend.Recently.I have a college fund I can dig into.Charlie won't know.I really get it if you think this is stupid and reckless.If we're going to be working on this every day, we should probably include some homework. Don't want the Dads to think I'm a bad influence on you.I am older than you.And I convinced you to secretly build us two-wheeled death machines.Taught him everything he knows.Oh, we're just friends.So I guess you guys have girlfriends.You're on.I never forgot my reason for doing what I was doing... Jacob clowns for Bella's amusement, pretends to skewer himself with a pipe. She laughs.But being with Jacob was a bigger perk than I expected...Tell him I'm not into the cougar thing.Not even Jacob could keep away the nightmares...... the terror, the loneliness.It's... not as bad as it was.He's been keeping me afloat.Sure, I spend all my free time on crankshaft-dot-com.Someplace sunny.I know a place above the cloud line --Actually, it's... too hard to get to.Isn't that... Sam Uley?Oh my God! Stop them! --What, on purpose?Think I could?You said it was a rush.You don't like them.What are they protecting?That's Embry? I didn't recognize him. What happened to him?Maybe you should just avoid them.Hey. If it gets worse, we'll go to my Dad. Or you can come stay with us.You're not the only one. Everyone stares. Did Bella just speak?My dad's been getting reports at the sheriff's station. A couple hikers went missing. People are scared.I'm not.I'm going again.Release it. Slowly.I don't -- how do I turn!?I want to go again.God, I'm sorry.It doesn't... bother you?Just, you're actually... good looking.Oh I - yeah.Jake, you're hot.No, temperature hot. You're burning up.It just... means something else to you than it does to me.Good looking.More than anyone. But... that's all.I already do. You don't know how much. You're my best friend but... I don't think my feelings will change.I'm sorry. I should've said something right from the start --I told you, you have a fever. Probably that flu everyone has.Hey Jake. Just checking to see how you're doing. And to say I'm sorry, about, you know... how I feel and... hope the flu passes fast. Call me.Hi Jake. Your dad said you have mono. He won't let me visit but... would you call me?Me again. I just... need to hear your voice...Jacob. Please. Call me.He's too sick to even call?No, go. I'll call Jess or someone.I was more afraid of the hole in my chest than I was of bears. Without Jacob, I needed Edward more than ever...... I needed to know he existed. There was only one place I might find him, or the feeling of him...Laurent?Laurent!I live here. But you - I thought you were in Alaska with Carlisle's friend.You tried to help us.Um... something like that.Absolutely. All the time.I'll tell them you stopped by.Will they be able to reach you in Alaska?... You're still friends.That's... too bad.Edward will know who did it. He'll come after both of you.No, Laurent...Edward. I love you. Laurent is milliseconds from biting - then abruptly, his expression changes. He sees something in the forest behind Bella - and it terrifies him.They're not giant bears -- I saw them. Up in a meadow --Wolves. They're wolves, Dad.Five of them. The size of - of cars. I swear. They went after -- something - - and I ran.Something dangerous. Victoria.If she came after me, Charlie would try to protect me -- and he'd die.Good! -- That's good.Actually, I -- need to see a friend.Hi, Billy. I know Jacob's sick but --Oh.Wait -- he's got mono, right? That's what you told my dad.You cut your hair.What happened to you?I can help.Sam got to you. What did he do?Then who?I... don't know what you're --The Cullens are long gone. How are they to blame?Jake, I know I hurt you. I should have been more up-front but -- I needed you, I still do. I don't know what that means yet, but if you give me time ---- \"It's not you, it's me?\" God.You're wrong --I can't take losing my best friend, too.Don't say that -- you promised --I'm... going to change.Why!?What the hell are you doing?No! He launches himself THROUGH the window with great agility --Why are you here?To kick me in the gut again? It was bad before, but you made it so much worse.Then leave.You're done with me, remember? Get. Out!Find what out? He starts to speak -- but can't. It's agonizing. She sees he's in pain. Is concerned.What's wrong?Yes, you can. I'll help you. We can... we can leave. Leave home, leave Sam.I don't want to play games with you --... about... \"The Cold Ones?\" You said it was a stupid tribal myth.That... the tribe made a treaty with them. They can't come onto your land and... I don't know, I don't remember.You have to give me more. Tell me where to look. Is there something I should see -- ?I'll take the risk. Jacob, show me.The motorcycles - that clearing in the woods. He nods slowly, then turns to go. She stops him.Don't go. There are dangerous things out there; more than you know.If I was going to lose someone else, I needed to know why.Not until I know what you did to Jacob.It's alright, Jacob, I'll go --Run, Jacob! --Jake, no! Stop -- !Wait. We should go back, make sure Jacob's okay.Why would I stare? --And you're a... you're all...He didn't say anything, or... couldn't.You're not the first -- mind reader I've met.But I don't get -- how? Why? --You just have to... stop.Killing is in your DNA?Hey, they manage to survive without hurting innocent people.\"Just?\" Those hikers' lives mean that little to you?Oh my God.From what?Vampires? Jake, no --That's not what I -- you can't fight vampires. They're too dangerous.You... killed Laurent?No, God no. But... how?\"Mono.\"It's bad, huh?Like you could get rid of me.You're not like that. You save people, right? You saved me from Laurent.Victoria. She's here?I know what she wants. Me. SMASH TO:I should leave town.No one can catch her. She can escape anything.Some of them do.No, I -- shouldn't have - no.I could use the rush.You're here.Yeah, I just... is Jacob here? He wasn't at home...You won't stay with me any other way.Yes!... Jake? She focuses, finally SEES Jacob hovering over her, relieved. Behind him stands Sam.I needed... to see... something.I know. It was stupid -- -- Sam said hospital - someone's hurt?Oh my God - does my Dad know?Will Harry be okay?Must be nice, never getting cold.It's a Jacob thing. You're just... warm.Like the sun.Yeah, `cause that would be fun.So... this wolf thing's not all bad?... but...That's a good thing, isn't it?I won't let that happen.Thanks for driving - for everything.How do you know?Stop! It's not Victoria --It's Carlisle's car! They're here. Go back! --It's okay. They're my friends ---- It's not a war --I don't need you to --Only if you draw one.You don't have a choice. I don't belong to you.Alice!Oh my God, Alice. You're here.You keep saying that.I didn't. I was cliff diving.Um... fun?Until I hit the water.Oh. Probably Jacob. He's kind of a werewolf.Werewolves are not vicious.They saved me from Laurent, they're protecting me from Victoria --It was Jacob who saved me. More than once. I couldn't have made it without him. You have no idea what it was like.... Does he know you're here?Don't worry about me. Are you gonna be okay?I'm not the most popular person on the werewolf rez right now.-- Alice.Quil... you, too?Yes. Shouldn't you be at the funeral?Look, Jake, I'm sorry I --You're welcome to leave. In fact --Just Alice. And she'll stay as long as she wants.Not that I'm aware of. Anything else?Better go report to Sam.It doesn't have to be this way.Am I gonna lose you this time, Jacob?Wait, who was it?You should have let me talk to him.Alice, what's wrong?What about him? What happened?That was him calling, not Carlisle.He won't believe Alice. He has to see that I'm alive.But I still love him, and I'm not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt. This wounds him. But she can't stop to soothe him. She pulls away and continues packing.I'm eighteen, legally free to go. I'll leave a note.Let's go.Bye, Jacob.Where'd you get the car?Not today.How much time do we have.It's almost noon now.Why are they all wearing red?We only have five minutes --Where's the square?Edward! -- -- GONG! Bella's cry is drowned out by the BOOMING CHIME. She pushes toward him, fighting to reach him as --No, Edward! Don't!No, I'm here. I'm alive.Look at me! Alice was wrong.Please, step back. I'm alive, I'm --I'm here. They share a long look, he's about to kiss her again... when suddenly, he stiffens -- and abruptly PUSHES Bella behind him, taking a protective stance in front of her --Who is she?Stop!Edward, don't!Stop this! Please!Do it! Kill me! Just leave them alone! -- as she yanks her collar back, exposing her neck to him. Aro is surprised and intrigued. A beat.-- Stop!It... wasn't a dream.No, you might --Why? Out of guilt?Didn't you?You didn't even want me.But it was so easy for you to leave.I kept seeing you. Visions of you. Always protecting me. I thought I was going crazy.I'm okay. You don't have to worry.I'm really sorry, Dad.I know.Nope.You won't be able to get rid of me once Alice changes me.They'll come after your whole family. You'd risk that just to keep me human?I really do. They look at each other; an impasse. She decides something, grabs her jeans, pulls them on--You're not the only one with a say in it.You all know what Edward wants. And you know what I want. But I won't force myself on you...I think the only fair way to handle this is by vote --This is my meeting, Edward.However this turns out, I'm not letting the Volturi hurt you. I'll go back to Italy alone --That's not up for a vote, Emmett. I don't want you involved.No, please -- I want you to seriously think about this. If I join you, you'll be stuck with me for a long time - forever. It's a huge decision. And I want - I need your honesty here.Then let's take a vote... Alice?Um. Thanks? Okay, Rosalie? Rosalie, torn, looks at Edward who's stony toward her.Thank you, Esme. Carlisle moves, not to Bella, but to --Thank you. Thank you all. EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - SAMEAfter graduation.It'll be best for Dad that way. I can pretend to be at college somewhere. Carlisle suggested it. But... I wish you'd be the one to change me.Name it.The Volturi won't wait that long.I won't risk it. It'll have to be Carlisle.Because I don't believe you've lost yours. And I want to share mine with you forever.What is he doing?Well, he can talk to me first.I've been calling you.Dad grounded me, Jake. We're trying to get back before he wakes up.What? What key point?But... if I choose it, it's none of your business.That's not your call --Stop!You do this, you'll be going through me.I swear to God, I'm not moving.Give me a second. Please.Read his thoughts. Is he going to hurt me? Edward does, and finally, reluctantly backs away. But his eyes never leave the wolf's. They glare at one another.Jacob, I love you. You're my best friend. But... I can't change how I feel. Please don't make me choose. Because it'll be him. It's always been him.But you know how important you are to --There were problems ahead. Seemingly insurmountable...... If I didn't become a vampire, the Volturi would kill me. If I did, my best friend would do the job himself, or get killed in the attempt.Victoria was still on the loose, putting everyone I loved in danger...But I'd already survived the worst -- losing Edward. So I knew I could survive anything...And soon, I'd be like him. We'd face our fate together.

She spins to the voice behind her to SEE --Happy birthday.Happy birthday.Your birth is definitely a day to celebrate.Eighteen is a little early to be worrying about your age.Bella, I'm ninety.Yes, it's the age that's creepy, not the fact that you're dating a vampire.Class.Someone wants you.The bell's about to ring.I don't have that particular gift. But I can read a watch. I'm clever that way.How come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't?\"Friends\" don't spend two weeks looking for the perfect dreamcatcher.Little hard to tune out.Vampires. You can't trust them.Come on, the last real birthday any of us had was Emmett's - I think Bing Crosby was on top of the charts. You'll be helping us feel normal for a night.There are worse tragedies than a birthday. Look at Romeo. He's responsible for his wife's death. Who could live with that? ... Though I do envy him one thing.Not the girl - the suicide. Nearly impossible for my kind. But humans, a little poison, dagger to the heart. There are so many options.I considered it. Once. When James had you trapped.I didn't know if I'd find you in time. If I'd gotten you killed --Either way, I had a plan.There are... ways for us. At least one way. I would have gone to Italy, provoked the Volturi...Certainly not. But I apologize for being a distraction. Perhaps you should rewind to act five, scene one, line twenty-eight eighty-nine -- \"If you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.\"The Volturi are a very old, very powerful family...The closest thing my world has to royalty...Francesco Solimena painted this; he often depicted the Volturi as Gods.Yes. He lived with them for a few decades. He describes them as very refined - for killers.The Volturi are also what you might call enforcers.The only rule they have: to keep secret the existence of our kind.We don't make spectacles of ourselves, or kill conspicuously, unless we want to die.Who else would hurt me?Victoria? Yes, some day. But Alice will see her coming. And she won't win.I know. But you do protect me... From boredom... And loneliness... You give me a reason to stay... un- dead. But it's... my job; to protect you...... from everyone but my sister.Finally, a decent sound system in that piece of --I'll carry her to the kitchen.What do you want me to say?You got a paper cut. Normal people get paper cuts. And a normal boyfriend wouldn't have flung you into a stack of plates. A normal boyfriend wouldn't have had to fight the urge to kill you --That's your solution? My ending your life?You should go in. It's late.I won't be coming back. Not tonight.Walk with me?We need to leave Forks.It's time. Carlisle's supposed to be ten years older than he looks; people will start noticing.Now.Not you. Us.Nothing compared to what could happen. You don't belong in my world.-- You don't --I don't want you to come!No.I'd like to ask one favor though.Don't do anything stupid or reckless -- do you understand? ... for Charlie's sake. Just... take care of yourself.Don't worry. You're human. Time heals all wounds for your kind. Particularly if you're not reminded.Try to understand. Every second with you is about restraint. You're too fragile. I'm tired of pretending to be something I'm not. Reining myself in so I can be with a human.-- You're not good for me, Bella.I've let it go on too long. I'm sorry.I promise, it will be like I never existed. Goodbye, Bella. And here, for the first time, we SEE how truly agonizing this really is for Edward. But Bella doesn't see.Move, Bella.Move, Bella.Turn around, Bella. This is dangerous.Stop. Now.Walk away. Go.Stop.Lie.Lie better.Threaten him.Don't. Move.Step back.Stop this now, Bella.What?I'm hanging up now...I'm sorry. I am. But they wouldn't be happier with me around. Trust me.I know. But the further away I am, the safer Bella will be. She deserves a shot at a normal life --Why, Rose? Did something happen?Tell me, Rosalie. Tell me! --I... don't believe it.Have you decided?So you won't end this.Carlisle was right... heaven...You're... not real.Bella?You're here.I won't be needing your services after all, gentlemen.No rules were broken.Fine. Bella, why don't you stay and enjoy the festival?That's not going to happen --But not easily --Jane.It's alright. Alice will catch you.It's not without effort.One touch and Aro can see every thought I've ever had in my life.No!Get away from her -- !Alice, stay out of it.... don't...Go back to sleep. You've been through a lot.I'll be here when you wake up.You... think I asked the Volturi to kill me because I felt guilty?I went to them because I thought I'd lost you.Bella. The only reason I left was to protect you. I wanted you to have a chance at a normal, happy life.I had to be convincing. But easy? In my hundred years, I've never had a harder time than what I just went through.Your own instincts were speaking to you. I wish it had been me. But you're the heroic one. You saved me.He won't forgive me easily.Will you? I don't deserve it but... I hope you will. Because I honestly have no idea how to live without you.She won't have to. There are ways to keep the Volturi in the dark.Just? You really don't understand what you'd be giving up.You can't be serious --You can't go along with this, Carlisle, you know what it means.When?Just two months.Would you be willing to trade for that?Five more years as a human.I'll settle for three.Why are you so willing to give up your soul?He wants to talk to me.He thinks I'm keeping you away.Jacob, I know you have something to say to me, but I'd like to say something first. Alright?Thank you. For keeping Bella alive when I... didn't.I know. I'm still grateful. But I'm back now. And I'm not leaving Bella's side till she orders me away.Either way, we'll handle Victoria from here on out.She'll come back.We'll see.I haven't forgotten.-- Bella, step back --We're done here --Get out of here. Now!I'm here. Always. And she sees that's the truth, believes it.

JACOB BLACK, 16, jogs up, carrying a used car part, long, black ponytail wagging. He looks 18 due to his tall, muscular body, but the gregarious Jacob is a little klutzy, still catching up to his growth spurt. He nods to Edward, who moves off to the side but eyes them.Wouldn't seem so drastic if you came around more.Just here buying this for the Rabbit. I'm almost done with the rebuild. Gotta come take a ride when it's done. Oh, and hey, happy birthday. Your dad told my dad. So...I saw it the other day and thought of you - it catches bad dreams.Ooh, look at you, all psychic.Charlie!Bella!`Bout time you came by.Scrap metal.

Please.Age ain't nothin' but a number.God, you're right, you're like Satan --It's cool, it's just my boys.Hey. This is Bella. Bella, that's Quil and Embry.I said she's a girl and a friend.Right. Quil took his cousin to prom.Quil keeps asking to come over. I think he likes you a little too much.What is it with you and age? I mean, that Cullen guy was young, didn't seem to... bother you.We got lucky at the dump. You know how much a new crankshaft goes for?I think that's a porn site. These bikes are gonna be rolling soon. Where should we ride first?Like there's any place sunny around here.Where is it?So we'll find our sunny spot, right?And his cult.They're not really fighting, Bella. They're cliff diving.Scary as hell, but a total rush.Most of us jump from lower down.Man, first motorcycles, now cliff diving?Maybe on a warmer day. And not from the top. We'll leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples.They think they run this place. Acting all bad ass, calling themselves \"protectors.\"The tribe, the land, their right to be jerks. Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids; now look at him.He missed some school - then, out of nowhere, he's following Sam around. Same thing happened with Paul and Jared. They weren't even friends, now Sam owns them. Sam keeps giving me this look, like he's waiting for me or something; it's kinda freaking me out.I try but...Thanks. If this is how you're going to react, I'll freak out more often.You look scared.Brake? Clutch? Right. Gas? You ready?Slowly... release the clutch.You okay? Bruises, breaks -- ?I'm not sure that's a good -- Bella quickly rises and hops back on.Guess we're going again. Now what are you going to do with the clutch?Bank it! Bank - hit the brake!What, are you training for the X-games?Forget it. I'm revoking your motorcycle privileges. Man, look at your head.You're apologizing for bleeding?It's just blood, Bella.What are you staring at?How hard did you hit your head?Upgraded from good looking?I feel fine.What? I can't hold your hand?One, that's my problem. But two... we have fun, you think I'm hot --I know you like me.Because of Cullen?Look, I know what he did to you. I can see it in your face every time his name comes up. But you need to know - I would never, ever do that to you. I promise I will never hurt you. You can count on me.No. That's not -- I just feel... weird.It doesn't... feel like flu. I don't know what it is.Go away.Sam's trying to help me, don't blame him.How `bout those filthy, reeking bloodsuckers you love? The Cullens.You know exactly what I'm talking about.They started all this by existing. Goddamn leeches --I can't be friends with you anymore.Stop. Don't. It's not you --It's true. I'm not... good.It doesn't matter. This is over --You already have --Go home, Bella. Don't come back.Bella! Ouch - damn it; open the window.Get out of the way.I pictured your room more... cluttered.I had to talk to you. Alone.I know. And I want to explain. But... I can't.Bella, I literally can't explain...I broke my promise not to hurt you, I know. But I'm trying to keep it now. I need you to understand... even if you don't want to see me when you find out --I can't do it.It's not something I can run away from. I would run with you though. If I could. Wait. Wait, I already -- I told you. You know this -- you can guess.You have to! I can't tell you, but if you remember - it was that day I ran into you at the beach. I told you a story -- come on! I told you a story... about?Was it? Are the Cold Ones a myth?What else did I say?Try, Bella.No, that's too dangerous --Where was the last place you saw me... the way I used to be?I didn't tell her. You'd know if I did.Sam, she knows things about the bloodsuckers. She's been on the inside. She can help --Watch what you call her.It's not a life-style choice. It's in my DNA.Man, I thought maybe you wouldn't be such a hypocrite -- what, I'm not the right kind of monster for you? Can't measure up to your bloodsucking friends --Wait - innocent? -- so... you don't care that I morph into a giant dog. Just that I... kill people?Bella -- Bella wait... We're not killing hikers. We're trying to protect them.The only thing we do kill: Vampires.Don't worry, we can't touch your precious Cullens - unless they bite someone and violate the Treaty --Please. We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough.... He didn't seem like a friend.It's what we do, why we exist. A few \"lucky guys\" in the tribe have the gene. If a bloodsucker moves to town, our DNA kicks in, we reach the right age and the fever hits --I wish. Next thing I know, they're telling me, this is your life now. That future you saw for yourself? Gone.I just hate feeling... out of control. Like maybe Sam is right; you shouldn't be around me.You've seen Emily.Sam lost it for a split second; Em was standing too close -- he's still messed up about it. I don't want to be that kind of nightmare.Yeah, didn't mind taking him out. His red-headed girlfriend will be fun, too.We chased her all the way to the border the other night. But she won't stay gone. Keeps coming back -- if we knew what she was after... ... What?She is not bait.Like... what? Bella?Guys, back off.Don't worry, we've got this place covered. She won't get near you or Charlie.Hey, we should do something fun. Like... cliff diving, right?Soon. After we catch her.Breathe, Bella! C'mon!Bella? Can you hear me?What the hell were you thinking?What? The pearly gates? If we hadn't heard you scream --Why would you jump? Didn't you notice it's like a hurricane out here?Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.He and my dad are both over there.I don't know. Come on. I'll find you something dry and drive you home.Hundred and eight degrees over here.It's a wolf thing.Like the sun.Which always comes back. You can count on me.There are other cool things about all this, like -- I heal fast. Wanna see me stab my hand?It's better. Now that you know. But...It just... comes so easily to me. More than the other guys.Maybe. Or maybe it makes me less... human than the others. Sometimes I'm scared I might... disappear, you know? Who I really am.Holy crap -- !There's a bloodsucker out there.I can smell the stink. I'm getting you out of here. As Jacob whips the truck around, the HEADLIGHTS ILLUMINATE --Forget it --It's a trick --Damn it, Bella --Stop. You gotta come with me.Don't you get it? If a Cullen is back here, this is their territory. The Treaty says we can only defend our own lands.It is. And you'll only be safe in La Push. I can't protect you here anymore.-- You're about to cross a line --I'm not letting you do this.Bye, Bella, I hope you don't die.You alone?Had to talk to you first. I'll meet you there. Go on.This place stinks to hell.-- How many Cullens are here and how long are they staying?Are the rest coming back?That's it.I've done it again. I keep breaking my promise not to hurt you.Yeah, it does.It was easier when we were both human, wasn't it?Swan residence.He's not here. He's at a funeral...Filthy bloodsucker.Dr. Carlisle Cullen.He didn't ask for you --Step away from me, Bella.Why do you have to go?He left you, Bella. He didn't want you anymore, remember?What about your dad?You Cullens might hunt animals but those monsters in Italy don't.Then why are you taking Bella to them like a bottle of wine to a party?Please, Bella. Stay here. For Charlie... for me.You're still alive.Couldn't drop by?Stay the hell out of my head!No, you didn't. And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.We'll see.She's been laying low. Ever since your freaky sister showed up. Guess she can't stand you Cullens either.She does, she's ours. She killed on our turf.My turn to talk. I'm here to remind you about a key point in the Treaty.Good.If any of them bites a human, the truce is over. That's bite, not kill.If you... what!? No. No way. I won't let you --You're not gonna be one of them.You know what we'll do to you - I won't have a choice --You don't speak for her!", "clean_line": "bella jacob black jogs carrying car long black ponytail wagging looks tall muscular body gregarious jacob little klutzy catching growth spurt nods edward moves eyes wouldn drastic came buying rabbit rebuild gotta come ride oh hey happy birthday dad told dad saw day thought catches bad dreams ooh look psychic charlie bella bout time came scrap metal shouldn mechanic type friend motorcycles parts pricey charlie gonna love wow lying dad blowing college money repairing dangerous machines guessing ll want ride oh totally stupid reckless start influence age ain nothin number god right like satan cool boys hey bella bella quil embry said girl friend right quil took cousin prom quil keeps asking come think likes little age mean cullen guy young bother got lucky dump know new crankshaft goes think porn site bikes gonna rolling soon ride like place sunny ll sunny spot right cult fighting bella cliff diving scary hell total rush jump lower man motorcycles cliff diving maybe warmer day ll leave showing sam disciples think run place acting bad ass calling protectors tribe land right jerks embry hall monitors steroids look missed school following sam thing happened paul jared weren friends sam owns sam keeps giving look like waiting kinda freaking try thanks going react ll freak look scared brake clutch right gas ready slowly release clutch okay bruises breaks sure good bella quickly rises hops guess going going clutch bank bank hit brake training games forget revoking motorcycle privileges man look head apologizing bleeding blood bella staring hard hit head upgraded good looking feel fine hold hand problem fun think hot know like cullen look know face time comes need know promise hurt count feel weird feel like flu know away sam trying help blame bout filthy reeking bloodsuckers love cullens know exactly talking started existing goddamn leeches friends anymore stop true good matter home bella come bella ouch damn open window way pictured room cluttered talk know want explain bella literally explain broke promise hurt know trying need understand want run away run wait wait told know guess tell remember day ran beach told story come told story cold ones myth try bella dangerous place saw way tell know sam knows things bloodsuckers inside help watch life style choice dna man thought maybe wouldn hypocrite right kind monster measure bloodsucking friends wait innocent care morph giant dog kill people bella bella wait killing hikers trying protect thing kill vampires worry touch precious cullens bite violate treaty took leech dreads easy like friend exist lucky guys tribe gene bloodsucker moves town dna kicks reach right age fever hits wish thing know telling life future saw gone hate feeling control like maybe sam right shouldn ve seen emily sam lost split second em standing close messed want kind nightmare yeah mind taking red headed girlfriend fun chased way border night won stay gone keeps coming knew bait like bella guys worry ve got place covered won near charlie hey fun like cliff diving right soon catch breathe bella mon bella hear hell thinking pearly gates hadn heard scream jump notice like hurricane harry clearwater heart attack dad know come ll dry drive home degrees wolf thing like sun comes count cool things like heal fast wanna stab hand better know comes easily guys maybe maybe makes human scared disappear know holy crap bloodsucker smell stink getting jacob whips truck headlights illuminate forget trick damn bella stop gotta come cullen territory treaty says defend lands ll safe la push protect anymore cross line letting bye bella hope die talk ll meet place stinks hell cullens long staying rest coming ve breaking promise hurt yeah easier human wasn swan residence funeral filthy bloodsucker dr carlisle cullen ask step away bella left bella want anymore remember dad cullens hunt animals monsters italy taking bella like bottle wine party bella stay charlie alive couldn drop stay hell head wasn benefit trust ll laying low freaky sister showed guess stand cullens killed turf turn talk remind key point treaty good bites human truce bite kill way won let gonna know ll won choice speak"}}}
