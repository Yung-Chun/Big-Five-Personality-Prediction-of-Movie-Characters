Riggan throws on a sweater and stumbles into his slacks. He hurries out...Steve.Okay.Great. It'd be even better if I could get Ralph to stop acting like he's in an educational video for syphilis... The camera moves off of them and onto...Sorry I'm late. I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't know the man. I've only heard his name mentioned in passing. You'd have to know the particulars. But I think what you're saying is that love is absolute.Okay. Fugitives are on the run, Ralph. How many times do I have to-- Fugitives are scared. Give me more of that.Forget the understudy. We have to postpone the preview.Then do it. A crew member passes in the opposite direction.He'll be fine.Listen to me. It was going to be a disaster. That guy's the worst actor I've ever seen. The blood coming out of his ear was the most honest thing he's done so far.I'll make something up.Jake. This happened for a reason. It wasn't an accident.I-- I made it happen.Find me an actor. A good actor. Philip Seymour Hoffman...Michael Fassbender?What's his name? Jeremy Renner...The... the Hurt Locker guy.Fuck. They put him in a cape, too? Look, I don't care. Find me someone. Riggan enters...Then make him go away.You're my lawyer, my producer and my oldest friend. We are going to make this work. Now just get out there and do what you were born to do.I have no idea. But I have faith. Now go away from me.\"Breathing in, I embrace my anger. Breathing out, I smile to it.\"Not now!No.That's three words.Get out.I don't have an actor.Laura...Go away.Well... Absolutely. As you said... that Barthes said... Birdman, like Icarus...What?Who told you that?It's a lie.No!No. I'm not. And that's exactly why 20 years ago I refused to do Birdman 4.I don't want to look at it anymore.I don't care.Great.Nope.And, what did you say? 10/29/14 / 14.What pictures?Right. That's great.What do you want me to do?No.Yeah. What's up?No.He is?I thought he was doing--Which one? Quit or fired?Jake...You think he'd want to do it?Jake. Hang on a minute.Does he sell tickets?Do they like him?Hey.You think he'll be able to come tonight?Thanks for coming on such short notice, Mike. I appreciate it.I did.I am.Thank you.Hey, I wasn't expecting you to--Yeah, but you can go on with the script until you feel comfortable--Take a look at page twenty--What?What are you talking about?I don't-- What? 10/29/14 / 19.\"I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't know the man. I've only heard his name mentioned in passing. I wouldn't know. You'd have to know the particulars.

Spit it out. You're saying, what? That love is an absolute?\" 10/29/14 / 21.What do you think?That's my daughter, Sam.She's my assistant.Welcome aboard, Mike.I don't care, sign it.No you listen to me--I don't care. Give him what he wants.Then go into the reserve.It's a dream sequence, it--You're not supposed to call them midgets--Listen to me, you didn't see what I just saw. But you will, at the preview tomorrow. Look, get the contract done. I'll get the money.He's in.He's in a fitting with Larry. Lesley comes down the hallway.I'm fine. How's Mike?No. 10/29/14 / 28.Good or bad? Cause right now--It's good. It's great. She smiles, her eyes filled with emotion. Riggan smiles back, and nods absently.You're pretty sure it's mine?Yeah.What--?Okay.He's good.What?Been what? I'll tell you what real love is. This happened a few months ago. And it ought to make us ashamed when we talk like we know what we're talking about when we talk about love.I don't have to be drunk to say what I think.What are you, counting?Shut up. For once in your life. Will you do me a favor and shut up for a minute? Like I was saying... There's this old couple, had a car wreck out on the interstate. Some drunk kid plowed his dad's pick up into their camper.Fucking teenager. By the time I got to the hospital, the kid was dead. He was off in a corner laid out on a gurney. We took the old couple up to the O.R.. They were a mess. We worked like hell on them for most of the night...When we were done, we wrapped them in full body casts. The husband was depressed. Even when I told him his wife was gonna pull through, he was still depressed. So, I got up to his mouth hole and asked him, and he told me it was because he couldn't see her through the eye holes. Can you imagine? I'm telling you, the man's heart was breaking because he couldn't turn his goddamn head and see his goddamn wife.I mean... It was killing him. Killing him that he--It was killing the old bastard...Come on, Mike.Take it easy. You're drunk.Get Mike out of here.I want him gone.What?What are you-- Of course we can do that. It's our show.No. You listen to me. Get him the fuck out of my play. Did you see him out there?We're getting rid of him. I'm not going to stand up on that stage and--Holy Fuck!Meet me in front of the theater in 10 minutes.I didn't know you were here tonight.What are you doing here?No, I mean here. Now.I appreciate that.The play?It's good. It's the same.We talk. We-- I don't know, it's been crazy around here.Of course....I know, Sylvia...I really do get it.Stuff...Yeah. Suddenly, Laura opens the door and sticks her head in.I don't wanna talk about it. 10/29/14 / 38.I'm having a beer.So, what's going on with you?I'm thinking about refinancing the Malibu house.I'm thinking about--I need the money.What do you want me to say? My health lasted longer than the money... Go figure that out.I have a chance to do something right. And I have to take it. I have to.The last time I flew here from LA, George Clooney was sitting two seats in front of me. With those cuff links, and that... chin. We ended up flying through this really bad storm. The plane started to rattle and shake, and everyone on board was crying... and praying. And I just sat there-- Sat there thinking that when Sam opened that paper it was going to be Clooney's face on the front page. Not mine. Did you know that Farrah Fawcett died on the same day as Michael Jackson?Why did we break up?I will.Shut up.Leave me alone.What does that mean?Who ordered a sun bed?Let's go. Walk.To get you some coffee. Have I done anything to disrespect you?I have a lot riding on this play.People know who I am, and--Mike--Well, I'm sorry for being popular, but that-- 10/29/14 / 42.Okay, I don't even know what that--A lot?Right. Is that what tonight was about then? Wrestling with \"complex emotions\"?Where are you going?People were laughing in our faces.We're doing Raymond Carver. This play is a drama. This play is--That's...She does look like she licked a homeless guy's ass.Of course. It's no trouble at all.See you tomorrow.A long time ago, I did a play back in high school in Michigan. He was in the audience. He sent this backstage after.And that's when I knew I was going to be an actor.Why is that funny?So...What're you still doing here?Great...Hey.I'm not sure if I said thank you.All of it. You've been doing a good job. And I've been...So, I just wanted to say that-- What is that?That smell.Look at me.Look at me.You have to be shitting me... Where is it?What is this?This.Sam.Relax? What the hell are you doing?You can't do this to me!SHUT UP! You know what I'm talking about.Don't try to--Listen to me. I'm trying to do something that's important...It's important to me! Alright? Maybe not to you, or your cynical playmates whose sole ambition is to end up going viral and who, by the way, will only be remembered as the generation that finally stopped talking to one another. But to me... To me... This is-- God. This is my career, this is my chance 10/29/14 / 50.to do some work that actually means something.Terri! Terri!Terri! I know you're in there!Terri???Why? I need you to tell me why. I lived for you. I worshipped you...Fuck you. Shut up. Fuck you.What's wrong with me? Why do I end up having to beg people to love me?I just wanted to be what you wanted. Now I spend every fucking minute praying to be someone else. Someone I'm not. Anyone...You don't, do you?And you never will...I don't exist. I'm not even here. I don't exist. None of this matters.Is she okay?None of this is your fault. You're beautiful. And talented. And I'm lucky to have you. Okay?Okay.What now? Laura lays the Arts section of the New York Times down in front of Riggan.Shut up.Fuck. This is it? This can't be it.\"Riggan Thompson, better known as the face of the Birdman films, tries not to lay an egg on Broadway...\" Where's the rest of it?They didn't use the photo I sent them.The one you liked. The one you said I look like a young Jack Nicholson.How can you be so calm about this?Aren't you scared at all?About being humiliated out there.I bet it won't.Get up!Get up. Riggan slaps Mike on the arm.So, Carver is the reason you became an actor?This is my play! I did the work. I raised the money. I arrange the press.You said the first-- Fuck the Arts section. The first thing that came to mind? Right. Cause that's you. Mr. Natural. Mr. Fuck the scene, just stare at my massive hard-on. Because that's the truth of the moment.Shut up. Shut the fuck up. You don't get hard on my stage unless I tell you to.So, you wrote your own lines?You changed a few words, and mumbled a little, you self absorbed prick.Let me tell you something, you spiteful nobody piece of shit.Fifty thousand views? A cat playing with a dildo has more than that.Yes you do. Everybody says: \"Mike is so honest\". \"So truthful\".You said in the interview that your father was a drunk, like Carver. Is that true Mike? Is it really true?Because my father was. My father was a mean fucking drunk. Beat the shit out of us. But we were okay with the beatings. You know why? Because at least when he was beating us, he wasn't thinking about taking us out to his tool shed...That sonofabitch would smile and say, \"Do you want to kneel down and unbuckle my belt? Or do you want me to take it off and use it?\" I learned how to make myself numb. But my sister-- My little sister...Yeah. It's also not true. See? I can pretend too, you little dick!Don't fuck with me, Mike.You have no idea what I'm capable of. You understand me? Riggan pulls the paper out of his back pocket.Working with Riggan Thomson is like waltzing with a monkey?Let's go. Put your hands up.Breathing in, I feel my rage. Breathing out, I embrace my mental formations.Breathing in, I am calm. Breathing out, I ignore my mental formations. This is a mental formation. This is a mental form--Leave me alone.I was not happy.Shut up! Stop whining! I was miserable!Fuck you!And billions of flies eat shit everyday! So what? Does that make it good? And I don't know if you've noticed, but that was 1992! Look at me! This is what's left! This! This! I'm fucking disappearing! I'm the answer to a fucking trivial pursuit question.What part of that don't you get? You're fucking dead.Stop saying 'we'! There is no 'we'. I am not you. I'm Riggan fucking Thomson.Fuck you! Fuck you!What's up?Yeah. Sure.Okay.Good. Great.Oh, that's terrific...I can't do this anymore, Jake.I think I'm gonna cancel the preview. I'm exhausted.I'm starting to believe that this is not for me. The applause is... lukewarm. I think they're laughing at me.Really?Okay. I'll be ready.Yeah, I-- This is nothing. Shaving. He cleans his hand against his trousers.For what?You did good.Mine too.Me too. It's going to be great. Full house.Fucking teenager.By the time I got to the hospital, the kid was dead. He was off in a corner laid out on a gurney. We took the old couple up to the O.R.. They were a mess. We worked like hell on them for most of the night...When we were done, we wrapped them in full body casts. The husband was depressed. Even when I told him his wife was gonna pull through, he was still depressed. So, I got up to his mouth hole and asked him, and he told me it was because he couldn't see her through the eye holes. Can you imagine? I'm telling you, the man's heart was breaking because he couldn't turn his goddamn head and see his goddamn wife.Yeah. So I guess what we have to ask ourselves is... What do we talk about when we talk about love?Yeah. Hey. I think we have to talk.Right. We will eventually, though, `cause that's the only way I get to say I'm sorry. I really am.Horrible. We would've been just--...a serial killer...You have a cigarette?Breathing in, I calm myself. Breathing out, I ease myself.I'm sorry. I can't really--Are you kidding me?Give me a fucking break, lady.Fuck you!Jesus Christ! What're you doing here?I have a play to do. 10/29/14 / 85.Knock knock knock! Terri! Terri!Why? I need you to tell me why. I lived for you-- I worshipped you...Fuck you. Shut up. Fuck you.Shut up!What's wrong with me? Why do I end up having to beg people to love me?Hey. How ya doin'?Why?I'm good. This is good. You want some?Great. Great.Yeah.Yeah. Well... I don't know. The previews have been a train wreck. We haven't been able to get through a performance without a raging fire... or a raging hard-on. I'm not really sleeping, you know, at all. And I'm pretty much broke. Oh, and also, this play feels like a miniature, deformed version of myself that keeps following me around, hitting me in the balls with a tiny hammer. Sorry, what was your question?What are you doing? Some homework?Really...I was a shitty father, wasn't I?Fine... You're right. I am just \"fine\". Adorably mediocre.What? 10/29/14 / 89.Oh... Shit. I'm sorry.Really? What does that mean?It's for you.Go ahead...Go.Let me have another one.I got it. She's a friend of mine.That was twenty years before I put on that damned costume.I'm just saying, when you come tomorrow night, I want you--What are you--You haven't even seen it. I don't-- Did I do something to offend you?But you don't even know if it's--What has to happen in someone's life, for them to end up becoming a critic?Whatcha writin'? You reviewin' a play? Was it good? Bad? Did you even see it? Lemme read.No you won't. Let's read your review! \"Callow\". A label. \"Lackluster\". Label. \"Marginalia\". Sounds like you need penicillin to clear that up. None the less... label. All labels. You're a lazy fucker aren't you? Epistemological vertigo?You know what this is? You don't, do you? You can't even see it if you don't label it. You mistake those sounds in your head for true knowledge.Nothin' about intention, structure, 10/29/14 / 93.technique. Just crappy opinions backed up by crappy comparisons. You're incapable of writing more than a couple of paragraphs, and you risk nothing of yourself. Well, I'm an actor and this play has cost me everything. So you can take your cowardly, malicious, shittily written reviews and shove them up your... ...wrinkly, tight ass.A film.One more time...Sorry. Can't talk. I'm late. Music.Yes. I know where to go. 10/29/14 / 99.Stop the music.Come here. Sit next to me.I'm fine. Sit.I am calm. I'm great. I spent most of the day observing how beautifully this pile of dirty clothes was lit by the warm afternoon sun. So beautiful. Sylvia, teasing him, closes her eyes and imitates Riggan's meditation posture.You know? I have this voice that talks to me and tells me the truth. It's comforting, and scary.Okay.You wanna hear something funny?Do you remember our last anniversary party?Do you remember the party?Yeah, well. Let's skip over that part for a minute.After you threw the guests out of the house, and the furniture out of the window. You locked yourself in the bathroom.I drove down to Malibu. I sat on the beach for a while. Just... staring out at the ocean.Until I walked straight into the water and tried to drown myself.I was in up to my chest when I felt the first one. On my back, like somebody was holding a frying pan against me. And then my chest, and my legs. The water was full of jellyfish. I fought my way out of the water, and I started rolling around the sand like a maniac... crying.And you believed me.I love you. And I love Sam.I never should have video taped Sam's birth. First of all because you and Sam both look like shit in that video. But mostly because I missed the moment. I should have just been there with the two of you. Present in my own life. So I'd have it. But, I don't. I don't have any of it.No, I don't.No, I understand. She needed a father and she got one shamefully successful youtube video. Pretty pathetic.You should get back to your seat. You don't want to miss what's next.Twenty little leopards laughed at two lofty lions. Twenty little leopards laughed at two lofty lions. Twenty little leopards... laughed.I don't need it.Terri! Terri! I know you're in there! He barges through the door and onto... 10/29/14 / 105.Why? I need you to tell me why. I lived for you-- I worshipped you...What's wrong with me? Why do I end up having to beg people to love me?I just wanted to be what you wanted. Now I spend every fucking minute praying to be someone else. Someone I'm not. Anyone...You don't, do you?And you never will...I don't exist. I'm not even here. I don't exist. None of this matters.Pum.Pum.What is that?It's what I wanted.I can't smell them.What are you doing?Very funny...You're joking.Let me see the picture.Thanks a lot.Let me see.I do look hideous.",

That's pot.Alright, just relax.Protecting myself from cataracts?To you?Yeah. You're talking about you. What else is new?What? Make it about me? I wouldn't dream of it.This is not important.Means something to who? You had a career before the third comic book movie, before people began to forget who was inside the bird costume. You're doing a play based on a book that was written 60 years ago, for a thousand rich, old white people whose only real concern is gonna be where they go to have their cake and coffee when it's over. Nobody gives a shit but you. And let's face it, Dad, it's not for the sake of art. It's because you just want to feel relevant again. Well, there's a whole world out there where people fight to be relevant every day. And you act like it doesn't even exist! Things are happening in a place that you willfully ignore, a place that has already forgotten you. I mean who are you? You hate bloggers. You make fun of twitter. You don't even have a Facebook page. You're the one who doesn't exist. You're doing this because you're scared to death, like the rest of us, that you don't matter. And you know what? You're right. You don't. It's not important.

Why not?It's a second part.That didn't seem to be a problem for you on stage.I wanna ask another question...One more.If you weren't afraid. What would you want to do to me?...That's sweet...G'night, Mike.How did you know I'd be up here?Where's Lesley?Smart girl...Ready for the last preview? Who did that to you?Could have been anybody, I guess. I'm sort of hoping it was Lesley. He barely says no, smiling, and lights a cigarette. She understands.Oh, don't tell me...He was never around, so...No. That was-- Who gives a shit. It was the way he tried to make up for it by constantly trying to convince me I was special.

It was weird. But that's sort of cool. People seemed to like it. 10/29/14 / 88.No. I don't-- When I was in rehab, they made us do this.Yeah.

Isn't it?Do you have any idea who walked these boards before you? Geraldine Page, Marlon Brando, Helen Hayes, Jason Robards... And now you. Riggan Thomson.Hey. This is what we do. So, you wrote this adaptation?And you're directing the adaptation and starring...Ambitious.Why don't we do a bit of it?First preview is tomorrow, right?Let's just do some of it.Yeah. I don't need that.I don't need the script. Just give me a cue.Feed me a line.Feed. Me. A line.Am I saying that love is absolute? \"Yeah. The kind of love I'm talking about is. The kind of love I'm talking about you-- Well, you don't try to kill people.I have a thing, a whatever, a gift. Come on, I helped Lesley get off book. Hey, give me that cue again.Okay, can I-- Do you mind if I--Follow me. He says, \"I'm the wrong person to ask.\" What's his intention? Is he fed up with the topic? Deflecting? Guilt about his wife maybe? Then four sentences all say the same thing... \"I didn't even know the man.\" 10/29/14 / 20.\"I've only heard his name mentioned in passing.\" \"I wouldn't know.\" \"You'd have to know the particulars.\" First of all, particulars? What are you, my grandmother? But the point is, YOU DON'T KNOW THE GUY, WE FUCKING GET IT. Make it one line. \"I didn't even know the guy.\" Right? ...Can we-- Are we doing something here? Come on let's go. Cut it down, give it to me again.Oh, right, sorry, you see? \"I'm the wrong person to ask?\" That's another fuck you. \"Don't put me on the spot. Don't make me self conscious about my marriage when my wife is sitting right here...\" See? Give it to me. Give me a good fuck you. Come on...Come on. Give it to me right now. Fuck me. Right now. Right here. Let's do it.\"What's my point?\"\"Yeah! Alright? The kind of love I'm talking about is absolute. The kind of love I'm talking about you-- Well, you don't try to kill people.So what do you think, boss? Do I have a job?I'm gonna take that as a yes. And you are...?Right. Yeah. I can see it around the... She doesn't look anything like you. And your job is...?Your assistant... And can you speak?Thank you, Captain.I'm Mike Shiner, by the way.That ass is great.This is the theatre, honey. Don't be so self-conscious.How're you doing, Larry?You gonna stand there?At home, under the bed, I think.Waiting for Larry to finish.Okay, well, then I'm just standing here with my balls out.Leslie...Les...Okay, then we should probably get her out of here.Hey, Sammy...To be fair, you make it really easy.She brought me.I know, right? She's a little--Come here.Play with my balls...I won't fuck it up... Probably! Larry reappears holding some clothes. We follow him out...The maniac shot himself right in front of us. I rode with him in the ambulance to the hospital.I didn't have to. But I did. He was in bad shape. His head swelled up to like twice the size of a normal head. I'd never seen anything like it. And I swear to God, I hope I never do again.Ask Nick what real love is. He'll agree with me. You watch.Nobody's drunk. We're just having a few drinks.I'm tired of this shit.What the fuck is this? Water?Did you just give me water?Come on what?Of course I'm drunk! I'm supposed to be drunk! This is Carver, man! The guy lost a piece of liver every time he wrote a page! If I'm supposed to drink gin then bring me fuckin gin! I mean, you fucked the time period! You took all the good lines for yourself! At least let me--Oh, okay. Seriously? You people are pathetic. Put the cell phones down and join the real world! Will somebody please just live in the real world?!! He crosses to the refrigerator.Look at this. It's all fake. The milk is fake. The butter is fake.Your performance is fake. Hey! There's chicken. Real chicken. The only thing real up here is the chicken. So I'm gonna stick with the chicken.Hey, this is good bird, man! Riggan charges through the chaos backstage running into a panicked Annie.You were good...Where are we going?Not yet.Is that right?Bullshit.Bullshit. People don't know you. They know the guy in the bird suit. They know the guy who tells those quaint, slightly vomitous stories on Letterman.Popular? POPULAR?... Oh God, popularity is just the slutty little cousin of prestige.My reputation is riding on this play. And that's... That is...A lot. Exactly. Fuck you. Yes. This doesn't work out for you, you get to go home to your studio pals and jump right back into that cultural genocide you guys are perpetrating. \"There's a douchbag born every minute\". That was P.T. Barnum's premise when he got rich inventing the circus. And you and your pals know nothing's changed, and whatever toxic shit you make people are still gonna pay to see it. But, after you're gone, I'll still be here. I'll still be making my living on the stage. Baring my soul. Wrestling with emotions, complex emotions.Tonight was about making it alive. About making it bleed. This isn't the Warner Brothers lot, Riggan. This is the city, and this is how we do things.They have coffee in here.Thanks, Tommy.Tonight they were laughing, tomorrow they'll be... be.. tweeting about us. Fuck `em. Who cares??? These are the people who pay half price to watch us rehearse. Stop fucking caring!You don't know what this play is. These are previews. This is where we find out what the play is.You see that woman over there? The one that looks like she just licked a homeless guy's ass? Nothing matters until she writes five hundred words about us in the New York Times.Tabitha Dickinson. Yes. And, believe it or not, the only thing that matters in theater is whether she likes us or not. She does, we run. She doesn't, we're fucked.Do me a favor, don't get your panties in a twist over a preview, alright? And don't tell me how to do my job. Cause, this is my town. And, to be honest, nobody gives a shit about you around here.Are we good here? Cause I'm gonna go.Why Raymond Carver? You never told me.\"Thank you for an honest performance. Ray Carver.\" What is this?He wrote it on a cocktail napkin.He was drunk.Hollywood's headed here, Tabby.\"A man becomes a critic when he can not be an artist, in the same way that a man becomes an informer when he cannot be a soldier.\" Flaubert, right?Yeah. And at 8 o'clock tomorrow, he's gonna get on stage and risk everything. What're you gonna be doing?Oh, I'm sure you will. If I ever give a bad performance. Ms. Dickinson.Hey, Les...I'm hard.No. I'm hard. Feel.Let's really do this. Let's fuck.I'm Mel. Not Mike. Mel. A knock on a door.Listen Ed, I know this is hard but-- More laughter. Riggan is disturbed, but he continues...Put down the gun, Ed. She just doesn't love you anymore.Just, keep your voice down...What do you want from me? I have to feel it. You know that. I told you that from the--...I was in the moment...But... You were incredible.Listen I'm sorry, alright, I--Can we--Can we talk about this like two--Okay, well, you're not ready. Mike points the prop gun at her, pretends to fire and...That was hot.Your gun is ridiculous. It looks like a plastic toy. And it still has the red plug in the barrel. You look like a seven year old when you're holding it. I'm not threatened by it at all.Have some self respect and get a new one. That was a fun crowd, huh?I don't think it's high enough.So, what are you doing up here?You were in rehab?Cool.Yeah.Maybe...Not really.Is it...?What?A game?What are you, eight?You gotta be--Truth.Because you have a great ass, and I noticed it. So, I said it. Truth or dare?Really...There's a bald guy about to walk by down there. Spit on his head.You said dare.Too late.Truth.Truth.No.That's a second question.I'd be afraid I couldn't get it up.Nothing's a problem for me on stage.You just asked--Go 'head.I would want to pull the eyes out of your head......And stick them in my skull, and then look out at this street and see it the way I saw it when I was your age.What the fuck is going on!Back away.Ow, fuck that hurts!What?They called me for an interview. I said-- I don't know, I said the first thing that came to mind. Jesus, we got the cover of the Arts section!You think it looked massive?Your stage? This stage belonged to a lot of great actor's, pal. But you are not one of them.Ow. Fuck. Yes I did.Look who's talking...Nobody? My hard-on has already fifty thousand views on youtube.I don't care.Ouch. Fuuuuuck. Cut the shit! Riggan corners Mike against the wall.Jesus, Riggan. I'm really sorry. I didn't-- That's fucking horrible...You're crazy...Don't you want to go put on your tights and your--What are you gonna do? You gonna get rid of me? Huh? What do you think my friend Tabitha is going to write in the Times after you get rid of me?For fuck's sake, just jump already.I didn't. I was just hoping.Moving on.I appreciate that. A beat.What's the worst thing he ever did to you?That was--?My dad?He pretended I was his son.I have no idea...He was right, though.About your being special. You're hanging around here trying to make yourself 10/29/14 / 78.invisible behind that fragile little fuck up routine. But you can't. You're anything but invisible. You're big. And you're sort of this really great mess, a candle burning at both ends, and no amount of booze or pills is gonna hide that.Truth.Truth.Do you have any idea where you're going?What now...?What?I don't pretend. Not out there. Just about every place else, but never out there.What are we doing here?I mean, what are we doing here?Listen Ed, I know this is hard but--Listen Ed, I know this is hard but--Put down the gun, Ed.
