Crazy as it sounds, God spoke to me...I'm gonna build a church.Right across the street. Not like Faith United or Calvary Fellowship. Place that ain't gonna turn you away if you a drug addict or a prostitute or whatever. Place for sinners, just like me, who wanna hear the word of God.We got money in the bank. Business is good. Besides, I own a construction company... I'm gonna give us one heck of a good deal on the build.`Lil bit.That's the orphanage I wanna build. In Sudan.That's me.Yeah, Ben, how you doin?Sure do.That's right. Gonna minister to anybody who's lookin for The Lord.What about em?I'm here for that boy right there. You gonna get in the way a that?Look at me. God don't make trash, boy. Now he ain't givin up on you, so don't give up on him, you hear me?You call him? Try him again.What, mom?It's nice.I just built a church. I ain't no preacher.Thank you, Tommy. You boys is soundin pretty good up here.I wanna thank ya'll for comin out for the first day of worship here at Shekinah Fellowship Church.The guest preacher we had booked today ain't shown up... so I thought I'd say a word or two.Lotta yous been wonderin what made me wanna build this here church. Seein as I ain't the best seed in the bunch I can understand that.Buncha years ago I was runnin from some bad fellas in the woods over there by Cleary. Those old boys was comin after me hard and I reached in my bag lookin for my old shotgun but it was gone. My momma had took it out when I wasn't lookin and put this bible in there instead...Well I figured I was done for, so I sat down under an old tree with this useless book and I waited...... and then the strangest thing happened. Them boys ran right on past me. Didn't even see me sittin there. Now the way I figure it, things would have turned out pretty different if I had pulled out that shotgun instead of this here Bible. And that's probably the first time I can remember God savin my butt. God... and my momma.Figure least I could do was build em both this church.Be back soon as I can.Have momma videotape it for me, k? Now I gotta git.I will.You watch out for em while I'm gone, ya hear?Right here, stop the truck!This is it...I think it's a heckuva good idea.If I wanted to be closer to Kampala, I'd be closer to Kampala. I wanna be right here...What are you sayin?Then it seems to me them people need help the most.Talk to me.I don't think you understand me, so lemme make it real clear to ya. I didn't pick this land -- God did.Good to meet you Betty.I'm lookin for somebody who can keep the place in order. Make sure things is taken care of when I'm away.She's gonna have to take care of the children too, make sure they're fed, fix em when they're sick. Can she do that?Tell her she's hired.You know what's funny? In English your name means \"darn it.\"Deng. It means `shucks.' You know, like you stub your toe and you go \"ahhhhh, deng!\" Get it?I'm sorry, buddy. It was just a joke.What does Sam mean in Arabic?Can I ask you a question?You believe in God?Maybe you'll invite him in again one day.How many are there?Where are your men?They're gonna pick us off like this!-- Betty! Get em to the church right now! Quickly. Understand?! --Get yer men back to the church! That's our best shot! I'll cover you...Put em in the middle!Just keep firin!It's me.They burned it to the ground. All of it. Ain't nuthin left.Nimule...Yeah.I can hear you.Cut it all down... so they got nowhere to hide...Come on in...What's goin on?What is she saying?Tell her she's gonna be ok.Where did they find em?Adjumani.I ain't waitin. You wanna see what waitin gets ya? Take a look in that buildin over there...No shot! There are children behind the truck!Cover me!What?You leavin?Well then, I ain't leavin neither...Mornin, buddy.Ain't you gonna say nuthin?Ok then.Guess I do.Take care of things while I'm gone, ok?You can't come with me, buddy.In your actions you give service to the Lord...... he's not interested in your good thoughts... your good intentions... he wants your hands... your backs... your sweat... your blood to pour into the foundation that will build up his kingdom!Sue.Been thinkin we need to put up a playground. Swings. Some things the kids can climb on.You said Sundays has been full.Be good for them kids, Lynn.Not talking bout here. Talkin about the orphange.Trouble with the push rods I think. She's runnin kinda rough.Used to fix them old shovelheads on the side of the road with a buckknife and a wire hanger.I think that old `78 broke down five times on that trip.Yep.The Lord don't ask for nuthin you can't deliver, buddy. And yer one tough ole boy.Why don't we pray together then...Our gracious Heavenly Father, bless us with the strength to carry on in your name. And grant us, in our darkest hours, the understandin that you are always by our side.Still got a ways to go, but we're gettin there. You should come on by one of these Sundays, bring the family.Reverand Carlton gives a mean sermon, puts me to shame. Anyway Bill, I'm here cause I wanna talk to you about what we're doin over there in Africa.Thank you, but I'm gonna be straight with ya. We're hurtin for money... If we had a little bit more support from people like yourself sure would help things run a lot smoother over there.I hear that, but you gotta understand that them kids over there got nuthin. I mean nuthin, Bill, and I'm not asking for much.Five thousand dollars.That keeps them doors open for another six months.You're right. We got problems right here. But with that kinda money we could feed them kids, house them kids.Ok.Sounds good.Thank you, Bill.Get in the car.Sonuvabitch is cryin pour-mouth to me and he's livin in the damn Taj Mahal...I asked him for five-thousand dollars to feed a buncha motherless babies and you know what he gave me? Hundred and fifty bucks. That's it. Handed it to me like it was gold bouillon! Sonuvabitch spent more than that on salsa for his party.I've had it with these people and all their bullshit about wantin to help...Stay outta my way.Throw in the car for five.Who's this guy?John Garang?Sam is fine.We can thank God for his blessins.Couple hundred with us here. Feed another thousand a day from nearby villages. Anyone who shows up hungry gets a meal.Until someone starts fightin for these children, I'm the one that's gonna do it.As a mule.Talkin bout peace in a room somewhere is a waste of time. You gotta go out and make it.Keep em closed! A little bit more!... keep comin'...Ok, stop! Open your eyes!He ain't the first old-boy who wanted to see my head hanging on his wall. Keep yer soldiers where they're needed. I can take care of myself.He said anything yet?Where's the brother?Hey buddy, you don't wanna play with the other kids?You know sometimes it helps to tell somebody what you got locked up inside, know what I mean?You have no idea what I'm sayin, do you?I done a lotta things I ain't proud of. Hurt a lotta people. Truth is, helpin you kids is about the only good thing I ever done in this life.But I'm scared. Scared one day I'll close my eyes to all this and make it somebody else's problem. Just like everybody else in this world.I don't see nuthin.Hold on...I got em.Deng, tell camp we're comin back with two. A.J., Nineteen -- go get them kids.What's he sayin?Shit. Tell him to stay where he is. Don't move.Ask him if he saw the shooter.You got `em?Can you reach the Browning?Need you boys to cover me on three, alright? Put everything you got into that rock up there.Hello?Everybody ok?How're the girls?By herself, huh?Goin fine.Sounds good.I'm just tryin to help these people. Same as you.I got a 200 kids who are gonna sleep safe tonight and wake up tomorrow mornin to a bowl of hot food. Right or not, that's all the reason I need.You fight the evil in this place your way, I'll fight it mine.What's goin on?That's where they sell em on the black market, ain't it?Let's go!Bring me a flashlight.What'd he say?Bring our truck up here and shine them lights on us. Pull everyone of them kids outta there.Put em right here... real easy...We're takin the ones that ain't gonna make it through the night. Come back for the others later.Tell her I'm not gonna hurt her.Put her in the truck.Tell em we're comin back.Tell em!Let's go! (to the children, holding upTell em to hide. Don't come out til they see my face...Gas it up! We're leavin here in five!It's just an application for a short term loan.It's only 90 days.I only got one truck over there, John. I need the money to buy a second vehicle.It's important. Now, there's one in Kampala I can probably get for twenty- one...I want you to look at this. See that? Twelve year old boy had both his arms cut off by LRA...Look at this John, when we found this little girl her breasts had been hacked off...Look at her. Look at this girl.Now I ain't in here askin fer money fer a hot tub or vacation or somethin like that. I'm askin for an extra vehicle so I can save some children. You understand that?But nuthin. I need you to open yer little book there and do whatever you need to do to get me that loan...Don't tell me to calm down! Look at those pictures! -- Look at em, John --... Open yer eyes!... Wake up!... You call yerselves children of God, but you ain't. Ya'll just sheep followin him deaf, dumb, and blind...But God don't want sheep. He wants wolves to fight his fight. Men and women with teeth to tear at the evil that's out there...THE LORD'S PROPHETS AIN'T MEEK MEN. THEY AIN'T MEN IN FANCY CLOTHES, THEY'RE WARRIOR PROPHETS...... MEN OF CONVICTION!...... WHO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A STICK AND A SWORD AND AIN'T AFRAID TO PICK UP EITHER IF THEY NEED TO!...... SOLDIERS WILLING TO GO FORTH AND SHOUT HIS NAME LIKE MEN OF WAR!...... DRAWING UP BATTLE LINES AGAINST HIS ENEMY WHEREVER THEY MAY BE...... WILLING TO FIGHT TO THEIR LAST BREATH...... UNTIL THE LEGIONS AGAINST THEM FALL AND ONCE AGAIN THERE IS ONLY HIS LIGHT...And only then will their hearts beat no more... and they will be turned to dust.No.You ain't rentin no limo to Pittsburgh.Nobody's spendin money on no friggin limousine.WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST SAY?!Too much talk in this house.

You nuthin but a stray fuckin dog round here, boy.Hell I don't. Now you get the fuck outta here fore I put yer head through that wall.You don't mind, I'd like to just sit here right now.Most of you want me to stand up here and make some sense outta this. That's why you come here today. You want me to tell you that God has his plan for all of us, and when he wants to call us back home he's gonna do it. That's what you wanna hear... That's what you wanna hear...Ain't ours no more. Best go through and make sure they ain't takin nuthin that belongs in the house.It's all done, so save yer breath... where's the keys to the safe?I need a new truck for the orphanage.What's the combination? What's the fucking combination.What are the numbers?You can make it up with the ministry.Fuck the Lord....

We have been forgotten by the rest of the world.Why are you here?What are you looking for in this place?And then you will get your picture and go back to your life and all this will just be a story you tell your friends.They are night commuters. They come from deep in the bush. Their parents send them out because it is safer to sleep here than in their own homes.Because death comes at night in the villages and refugee camps.These are the lucky one so far. The ones the rebels have not found. The invisible children.Where are you going?Sam...What are you doing?Sam, there are too many...... you can't help them all.Settle down... it's alright... you can sleep here till morning...The LRA attacked a village last night.You said you wanted to see.You came all this way to bring us new boots?Sam, wait...It is not safe here.Sam... this is Betty. She is from the village of Kotido. A few miles from here.She is knowing that you need someone to run the orphanage.She can do this.What is this `darn it?'This is not funny. In my language, in Arabic, names are very important. They tell you everything about a man. Your name proceeds you wherever you go. You are Sam. This is how you are known. In my language this means something.Small penis.Of course.I was raised to believe there was a God in heaven.But it is impossible to live here, to see what I have seen, and not turn your back on him.I don't think so.Two squads... There -- and there.I don't know.To the church! --Four on the right!All the way around...Preacher, you need to come see this.The Acholi people were farmers before they were driven from their ancestral homeland. Each year they blessed the soil before a planting.They are saying that fire brings strength and ashes abundance...... when the land burns, the next year the soil produces more...... she says you are a farmer and these children are your crops...... and this ground is richer now and they will grow stronger because of it.Their village was hit out Adjumani.Sam...Where are you going?Sam, please wait...Why don't you just go home?This is not your war.Looks like you've got yourself a bodyguard.I will, Preacher.Get out of there.Come on! -- out! --That's our leader.Some of the child soldiers say there is a bounty on your life. That Kony is offering money for your nose and ears.I'd like to assign a few more men to you during the day.All we know is that his family was killed and that he and his brother were taken into the LRA.Nobody knows.This is it.A.J. is dead.Don't move!Did you see him?!He did not see.Yes. He's on the ridge... just below that outcropping.I think you got him!It is ok. You can get up now.Sam.LRA wanted us here.An LRA convoy has moved north over the border. They're heading for Ed Duim.Look...The truck is too damaged to move. We don't have room for them all, Preacher.Bring the children out...Put them together here... gently...What are you doing?It's ok... he will not hurt you...We will be back for you!Hide until we return!Welcome back.Do you hear that, Preacher?There is no more laughter. The children do not play here anymore. They are scared once again. But now they are scared of you.The men do not trust you any longer to lead them into battle. They say you have a wish to die. I am worried about my friend. I want to help him.Some of the soldiers said he was asking about the commander that is being held at Kismoro.They have not see the boy.It will be light soon. What do you want to do?The village outside of Akot says an LRA caravan came through there an hour ago. They were headed for Ed Duim.Take them out.Cut the ropes!", "clean_line": "spla sudanese people liberation army freedom fighters deng yes bit thank military learn weapons thank yes going kampala want traveling dangerous time sudan rebels open road bad children little village called aweil hours family killed lra unyama hours stop lunch muslim north tried kill christian south years million lost lives people driven villages camps better cholera malaria little food soldiers protect worry lra attack night yes sorry sam ll minutes joseph kony wizard shapeshifter calls christian satan devours people fighting years little weapons old boots holes forgotten rest world looking place picture life story tell friends night commuters come deep bush parents send safer sleep homes death comes night villages refugee camps lucky far ones rebels invisible children going sam sam help settle alright sleep till morning lra attacked village night said wanted came way bring new boots sam wait safe sam betty village kotido miles knowing need run orphanage darn funny language arabic names important tell man proceeds sam known language means small penis course raised believe god heaven impossible live seen turn think squads know church right way preacher need come acholi people farmers driven ancestral homeland year blessed soil planting saying brings strength ashes abundance land burns year soil produces says farmer children crops ground richer grow stronger village hit adjumani sam going sam wait home war looks like ve got bodyguard preacher come leader child soldiers bounty life kony offering money nose ears like assign men day know family killed brother taken lra knows dead yes ridge outcropping think got ok sam lra wanted lra convoy moved north border heading ed duim look truck damaged room preacher bring children gently ok hurt hide return welcome hear preacher laughter children play anymore scared scared men trust longer lead battle wish die worried friend want help soldiers said asking commander held kismoro boy light soon want village outside akot says lra caravan came hour ago headed ed duim cut ropes"}}}
