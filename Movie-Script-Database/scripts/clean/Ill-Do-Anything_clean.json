{"Ill-Do-Anything": {"MATT": {"raw_line": "Good idea, let's not.We'll know all we need to from the reaction.Hey, no matter what this review says, the play was a great experience for me.I mean, it is about process, right?You've just got to be tougher than this.He's nuts.I don't want to hear anymore. Let's dance.Don't read it.You're wrong. I'm maybe relieved and curious. That's it.Don't. This divisive crap won't...Sorry.Come on, Ma, how could I show up tonight when my union is boycotting the Emmys? Look, I have to hang up.I gotta go. Watch!He was good.That took courage. I wonder if they send you something for just being nominated?Why are you being so damn foul?Look, Beth... the only...The only reason I haven't...The only thing I have against getting married is that it might not be fair because I'm going to stay with acting forever and you know how erratic the money's been and there's no resolve...Really?Hey, then we have no problem here. Marry me.I was just worried whether I could make you happy.Everything's okay... Great... She's six or eight pounds even. Oh, God... Nothing like it. I'll tell you something amazing. They really reach right into her stomach and pull out this baby. It's not just a rumor. God. I understand the expression 'mind blowing' for the first time. It means something so wonderful happens that the top of your head comes off and your brain pops out. Part of it was terrifying, the baby was turned and they couldn't budge her. I kept looking at this one woman doctor's eyes. And when Jeannie finally came out, this doctor and I each wiped away a tear at the exact same time, caught ourselves doing it, and then laughed together at the same time. Nothing can prepare you for it. You know why you're alive.How you doing? What's wrong?Could you get her, honey? I have that big reading tomorrow.Don't worry about money anymore. I didn't want to tell you, because it may sound a little strange when I say it out loud. You know me, I'm never that cocky. But I'm going to get 'Spider Woman'. It's me or Raul and I've never been so sure. It's weird, but I just know it. I do.I am gonna get this part, Beth.Hello... Hi, Beth. I'm glad you finally returned my call. What are you so mad about? YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SCREAM, I CAN SCREAM, TOO.You know what? I'm being a sort of gutless wonder here. I'm yelling back at you because I'm embarrassed. I won't be able to take the kid when I said... Why don't you listen for a second?Beth, I know exactly how long it's been and I feel strange as hell not seeing her but this isn't a choice. I'm broke. It's the driest spell of my life. I'm not saying it's your problem, but it's no place for a six- year-old. What can I do? The only full-time job I seem to have is not showing how scared I am. What? No, that's not something I said before. Well, thanks.Beth, Hey... hey. Never mind, I'll do it.I must get work. I will take anything. I must get work. I must not be embarrassed by these pep talks to myself...Hi... See, I did recognize you. You didn't have to wait for me.Well, challenge. I wasn't sure you'd remember me... let alone help...Well, that's a fresh slant.I'm real bad at interviews, so, if you don't mind, I'd really prefer to just read first.Yes.They only gave me these two pages. I'd like to give this my best shot. So if I could read the script and come back...Oh. Who will I be reading with?Can I read from here?Go ahead? The director left.'Incredibly drawn out...''Well, what am I? Your duck?''We've been together two years and you act like all you're doing is blowing away some feathers. So what I'm asking...'Huh?I know, but why would he quack when someone's breaking up with him?This isn't a comedy.A comedy? I think I have to make an adjustment here.I didn't get it. He did say something about wanting me back.Yeah, I just wanted to say thanks....and I wanted to ask you out.Any time.Okay. Thanks again. I felt funny asking.I meant asking you to get me the audition.Hey. Hey! HEY!!What happened?Is that it? You need a lift?I'm right over here.What the hell are you talking about? Not in your car... I've got my own.What do you need me for? Don't you drive?Yeah. It's important to you.I don't know him, so I have nothing to compare it to.Not quite himself.A little over two years. My wife insisted on moving back to the Midwest--then I was in the Philippines on the mini-series and...Hey, we just met.You might be right.Incredible. I was only there for a minute in the rape scene, moving past Charlie Sheen when I left the hut... I had a great scene cut out... I was...That's exactly what I was going for.You have to read all that?So what are you, totally wonderful or what?I don't mind an occasional odd job. But I can't work tomorrow. I have to get my kid.Uh-huh.Not really. Is she ready? I have the taxi waiting.It's three weeks.Yes, it is.It is.Just because you want to go off with him doesn't mean I...I don't think so. No matter how you put this...What did she do?Reminders?!? You can't say things like that to a little...I thought you'd read them to her.Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.She has her mother's sense of humor.Okay, sweetie. We have to go.What?Can we please go?It's going to be okay. I'm you're dad, you know? So it will be okay. You and I will make it okay. You ever ridden in a plane before?Sorry.It's underneath the plane. We can't get it.There's no way we can get the dress-- it's impossible.Don't kick the seat!As soon as we land. That's the compromise.God, I didn't hit her--she hit her.Jeannie, we have to sit down. Please.I have no idea what to do.Jeannie, you okay?Okay... so what do we do?I have a sleeping bag and bed. Which one do you want?How're you doing? I'm from next door. I see you with your kids in the laundry room...Say, 'Hello, I'm your new neighbor now too.'Say, 'Jeannie.'Say, 'Isn't that nice... How old is she?'Say, 'That's nice... I'd like to play with them... My Daddy didn't know your phone number, so we just decided to...'Say 'Daddy has to go to work tonight and...' I need someone to help me and her on short notice. I've seen your around with your kids and hoped you knew someone in the building or close by. I've got this new job that starts now. Do you know anyone?Oh, this is so great. Let's work out a full-time schedule and...Sort of a test?Please behave, understand? I don't know what we'll do if this doesn't work, so behave, sweetheart. Behave, behave.I'm sorry I bothered you. Jeannie...Your little boy fell, so he's screaming. And you want her to stay.Great. Thank you. See you later, Jeannie.No, that's okay. I'm fine with it. I feel fine.That's what breaks your heart. Jeannie's problem is that she's so down on herself.I don't know if lucky's the word. I'm hoping she's asleep when I get home so I won't have to deal with her... I'm actually afraid of my own kid.Your doctor says this?Everyone's tired. You can come back tomorr...Maybe if she stayed tonight she...I know... I know...You'll see Lucy in the morning. We're going home.I can't stand it anymore. I can't.What, in God's name, are you doing in this job you have?I mean him. What, in God's name, do you know about casting?Yes. What do you know? About anything? You don't even know you have a habit of touching your tongue with a finger like you want to lick yourself. Yet, you talk like you actually know something... So I want you to tell me... ...what you know.I've been an actor most of my life and this is the first time I've ever heard what the people calling the shots sound like when they're casting. So I really want to find out what, if anything, you know because what if nothing you know.Oh, you couldn't be more wrong. And I'm not talking to you. And I don't like you.You're minding my business. That's the problem... so, just tell me, what do you know?Just tell me and I'll shut up.What you know is the size of a schnozz. What you don't know is that these guys... ...are for real......that they can make something happen, and even they don't know what that is till they get in there and play a little... they can make something happen that you can't even imagine... and it's not your fault, this stupidity... 'cause you're just this scared little prick who gets to say he's making movies, and the only thing they ever taught you is that what you like doesn't matter.But isn't it almost good manners for you to feel a little shame?I didn't mean you.Oh, shit. You win. You got lucky with 'bitter.' That word just scares me to death.Look, I don't want to talk about it. I just had a real rough day... so just let it sit there, okay?Yes. Now, I really need to be quiet.No, you're not. You're not stupid and I'm not bitter... and you know why? Because there's no cure for either one and we've got to believe in some cure for each of us.Oh, Jeannie... I just can't do this now.Hello? Yes. Cathy... Hey. Just a second.Jeannie, please... be quiet for one second... this is very important for me.So? Wow. Good for you. Congratulations.Me? This is great. I'll come right over and pick up the script. Okay. If you want to. Bring it over. Goodbye. We might make it yet, kid.Hi.This is my daughter, Queen Elizabeth. Jeannie, this is Cathy.No. You're going next door.Remember our compromise? You're going next door to Lucy's to play and you'll show the kids your dress and I'll come get you later and we'll go out someplace and I'll buy you anything you want for under seventeen dollars?Thanks.Oh...?'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town?' Oh, it's a remake...And there's a part in it for...Okay... which part?Mr. Deeds?Who are we kidding? I'm even having trouble getting short parts--I'm going to say I love it no matter what you've done to it.Give me a second--all of a sudden, there's a lot to deal with.It's terrific.Because you're nice and you know I need work.Sorry, but I think the audition rule is that I have to be serious unless the person in charge is wearing a bathrobe and her nipples are sticking out... ...this much.It's really good. I get a little nervous thinking about the opportunity.If it's okay. I kind of work on these things in a private... it's just... it's a little better for me if I don't...Okay, let's do it. It won't kill me.I swear to God, I don't know which thing I want more, the sex or the conversation afterwards.I mean I haven't been to bed with anyone since Jeannie got here... I haven't talked to anyone the way I need to. I haven't seen anything this beautiful. I haven't felt this good about life. I mean, I've been lonely, Cathy.You can't shut the phone off. I left this number with Jeannie's sitter.I'm not worried. But if the phone was off, I would worry.Oh.It will be okay. I think the most important thing is to stop talking about the phone. Turn it off, monitor, whatever.I am so serious.Is this the kind of crap you listen to all day?I'm sorry...Is there a name for what we just had?This is awkward, my driving you around and testing for you tomorrow.Well, I hope you understand I can't drive you to work tomorrow and then go in and test. It's just...Thanks. And, look, if I get the lead in this movie, you'll have to go back to sitting up front with me.No sitter!!! Thanks. We're leaving now.How many men are they testing today?Then tell them I need a little more time.I mean for me. I want to focus a little.Hey!You guys have to leave. This is important and I need to be alone right now...It felt great... Everybody...Anyway, the girl I did it with, by the way, she's really good; the director, the crew... they all thought we nailed it.You wait here, Jeannie.I have to talk to you.What in hell is wrong with you? You actually think......that you can have my kid audition for a show without asking me.What's the part, anyway?How were they able to test her so fast?Oh... A child actor. Just what any kid with problems needs to straighten out--a series of her own...You'll let me know as soon as they see my test?Not if I don't let you. That's the law, the police law.You're going to have to learn to look at me and listen to me and the longer I have to wait THE ANGRIER I'M GOING TO BE.Me too. Just listen.Because I know about this. I have worked with kid actors... They don't have that much fun. They're inside all day... they don't get to go to regular schools or play with their regular friends like Ricky and Essa. And their parents? You think I'm going to be one of those parents, sitting in one of those rooms, where we all go crazy trying to jump start our egos with our kids' sweat, all the time smiling at each other like our lives are working while we root against everyone else's little girl? No!! No way! I can't!Pick it up, Jeannie.Let's work on it.What's wrong?Well, in that case, your dog died.I can't remember. You're too pretty. Oh, I told them I'd keep on being Chairman. I'm Chairman, you know.Told them I'd keep on being Chairman if they hired everybody back.Oh, that I was crazy. You always wear your hair back like that?Everything's okay... I'm sorry I forgot to put you back on with Cathy.I don't think you have to worry about that.Hi.Are you going to need me? The kids are rehearsing and I'd like to take a look.Is that true?I bet I know what it looks like to you.A giant \"find Waldo.\"That pretend living room, right over there.Wait a second, Jeannie. Let Daddy give you a few tips here.Hi.What do you think I did? I cried like a baby.Now you got it.You ever go out with him?You slept with him?Did you hate it?Good Lord.Not with that attitude.It's just that they... Well, did they tell you what an audience is?Good. Now, because there's an audience, they want you to know all the words you have to say really well. And since you can't read yet... ...you're going to have to be patient and try hard. I can help you.Yes. I can. I can help make it okay. Trust me.Not yet. Don't grab. Thank you. We really appreciate this. Hi, Beth. I...Jeannie, your mom's not going to understand what you mean.Why don't you let me be on your side for a second?Do you know what trust means?It means that even if something is hard to believe, you believe someone you trust because you know he wouldn't say it unless it were true.Yeah, I think you get the concept.I think you do.Just know that...You want to help me make a phone call?Seven... two...Cathy. She's very nice. One... six...You have to understand that sometimes people are too busy.I hope that makes you feel a whole lot better, Chile... 'Cause it sure goes a long way to cure what ails me....got in this much...Right. Over a...Yes. 'I can't believe I got in this much trouble over a word.' Now do you know what she means when she says that?No.It's your choice... But I'm not helping unless you try to understand as well as memorize. It will be fun. Come on. I know it's hard...Anything to shut me up, huh? Okay, this little girl you're pretending to be... she can't be with her Mommy either, just like you, or her father... she has to stay in Rainbow House which is called that because... Jeannie... ...because everyone's a different color... so when this little girl calls the black lady who takes care of all the children this terrible word... it's like the worst thing anybody can do... Come here.Yeah, I might have been working you too hard on that one.Now, did the director tell you how he wanted you to do it?Faster?Okay. We don't always get good directors, so it's important for us...I'm referring to the family of actors, you little shithead.It's a breakfast burrito. It's what actors eat when they're working.Now, let's work a little more. The most important acting you do is when you listen. You're worried about being able to cry when you're supposed to, right?Well, there are really only two ways to do it. Think of something that makes you really sad... or forget you're you and really forget you're pretending...'Don't test me, child! I could eat you for lunch when I was your age and I'm a hell of a lot bigger now!'That's it... You just looked at me and acted right without even thinking. And there are games you can play to help you with this. Get up... Now, be my mirror... do exactly what I do... that's it... now, at a certain point, I'm going to become your mirror, but I'm not going to tell you when... you tell me...Okay. We're going to make up words. The words aren't what matter now.You're a great dad.You're welcome. Don't mention it.I'm a free man. Let's go to your house and break the answering machine.I hope it's you.So this is how the big ones make out.What's the matter?Yes.Yes.You didn't like what I did?That's what it came down to?You folded on whether or not I'm sexy. You don't think I'm sexy... and you expressed that to...No. You were just... Aw, damn it, I am. Very. Yes.Hello.I don't think I can get into this...Worse. You caught me at a bad time you caused.Thanks.Yeah. Okay, good night.Jeannie.Just remember. You're not even here tonight. There's only this other little girl that you're pretending to be who lives at Rainbow House.Great.Great.Wouldn't miss it.Hey, then they'll just give you more chances after everyone leaves.I don't want to miss her introduction.I've got to see my kid.Hey. Good.Oh, Cathy. Look, I'm going to watch this. Let me talk to you later or tomorrow. Thanks for your help. It's good news. Gotta go.Shit.Why couldn't you wait till later? Shit.Huh?I think you're the best of the bunch.Wait. This is it.You little stinker!My little stinker.Amazing, right?You look happy.You want me to put you down?Okay... Now, you're not finished until you hug the lady just like you did me.I'm very proud of you. I love you more than anybody.Give me a kiss.This show didn't sell?!? How do you know so fast?That they're not going to be doing any more of these shows right now-- but...Honey...No. They're still having the party.Honey, we're going to close the place.This Oliver Stone thing... does he really want me?Which part?One of the two leads wouldn't be bad.Best part in the movie.I want to see my kid.You don't think I can tell you what to do?Good luck.Well, I told you.I never

{"raw_line": "Well, I wanted to introduce you. As if knowing me would help.It's a ridiculously awful movie.Stop. You're good. I'm doing them a favor by getting you in.Claire, this is Matt Hobbs.Hi. I just finished. I'll have my coverage right over. It's past derivative... it's photocopying. What a hoot! You're kidding, right? There is truly active bidding for this book? Really? 2.3 million? Okay, see you.I had some problems.Well, you know, it's a little garbagey.Hey. It's not like I didn't recommend it.How'd it go?Good. His saver is he means what he says.For when?I never know when I'm free. It sounds like I'm just... but it's true.Well, don't please.Oh... well, don't please.Don't be sad.Oh, I was auditing this acting course and he filled in teaching one night. He did a scene himself and he was awesome. For some reason, he can't get arrested.I never thought it would do this well. There were so many holes; I told everybody it wasn't going to do business. Why am I so public with my opinions?Not with that score. You know, maybe tonight's the night I'm losing my entire mind, but weren't you in 'Platoon?'But there was that one long close up-- where you seemed ashamed of yourself but still arrogant.It reminded me of my last boyfriend. Got to go.Beast of burden.To be honest, I had problems with 'Ground Zero.' But this 'People Get Hurt' one, while it might not be my exact, exact thing, I think will really work for an audience. It's so over the top, you have a great time.Yes.Burke's going crazy waiting for the score.How are you, anyway?It's a tough one, huh? Me too.What's wrong? What happened?If you didn't, you sure should have.I am.I'm not down for you. I'm down about myself.Please listen to me.I just got this feeling of seeing myself talking to you and how this is the most important moment of... ever.I've been watching this company make movies that cost tens of millions of dollars and all the while I've known about this wonderful script which we can somehow own and we could make for about $14,000,000... $3,000,000 if you can live without stars or a name director.I've sent you coverage on it nine times. I swear to you, Burke, it will work. You've never heard me say that.I don't know anything about action- adventure!! I have no idea where that came from. Hey, I know everyone thinks I don't have any commercial sense because of what I said at the 'Gremlins' preview and all... And you think I can't put myself on the line. Well, if this picture doesn't work, fire me. Have me killed if it doesn't get good reviews. If this doesn't get a 70 percent definite recommend from women 49 and under, I promise to be your sex slave until they drop ticket prices back to five bucks and start enforcing the R rating.You've got to do this. I think this movie can save me.'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.'Yes.Hi... What a pretty dress.Are you going to a party?Well,... thank you.What a little winner, huh?This is my favorite project. And it looks like we're going ahead with it.Well, come on, what's original? And this is a wonderful rewrite. It's funnier.Yes... Burke says I can test whoever I want. He wasn't even surprised when I mentioned you. So, if you could read this rewrite now and if you like it, we can make a test deal... they can make a test deal... we can tell them that they can make a test deal. I think it's important for me to steer clear of the business end.Longfellow Deeds.Who goes to town, yes.Stop being so creepy honest. I really have an instinct about you for this. I'm going home--call me when you finish reading it. Or... come on over.I mistimed it. I wanted you to catch me fully frontal.So you loved it. A lot? A little?Do you see why I think you're right?You know this is really happening, so I wish you wouldn't kid around about it.There are some mixed signals coming out of here, aren't there? Hi. Working... I can't write down a number now. Call me back. The script?I want to hear everything. You want to go page by page?Okay.Please. I understand.What do you mean?I'll tell you the truth, Matt. I've never felt more like turning my phone off.I don't understand what you're worried about.But I get a lot of calls.I could put the machine on 'monitor,' but it's going to be... I don't know.Okay.You look so serious.Please, we're making love here.It's all right.Jeannie's fine. There's a whole bunch of kids in the building. She's fascinated. And they're all ready for you.You're the only one.Sure. Good luck, Matt. The thing they're looking for most is sexy.Don't say it like that!!!Let him finish! God!If you wait one minute, I'll let you.Hey.Wait till you hear this one.Don't!I'm trying to hang in here but everything in me cuts off when somebody acts this way.I didn't... She went for water and by the time she got back, they had offered her the part. Blame Burke, he was there...The white kid in a multi-racial foster home with all these kids of varying ages. It's not a bad show. I sure can't wait to see the test.No. They offered it to her off the reading. I meant your test.Right away... You've got my vote.Please.The man is talented. If you get one of those directors who like actors, I think...We laughed.Everything doesn't boil down to...No...Hello. Matt... Hi... Okay, sure...Matt... Matt... Matt... Maybe it would be easier if I just said 'hi' to her... Hi, Jeannie... Yes, it's exciting... No, no. He's right, honey, they get somebody to read it to you. Now, put your dad on--it's important. No, first put your dad on... DAMN IT! ...Matt. Uh-huh, a few hours ago... They all... everyone liked your work, but I think they'll go for a name or something.It's not a matter of doing it differently... they liked what you did, a lot... they laughed and... it's not you... it's them. No, please. Don't thank me. If you feel like getting together later or anytime, call me, okay? You sound like you have your hands full right now... Goodbye.I'm glad I found you.You holding up? What did you do last night after I called?Okay. Okay. So you don't want to tell me. Be a tough guy.I feel relieved just seeing you after all that stuff... whew... Okay. Burke wants to...Yes.Yes.Eventually.This is the thing that makes me nervous about you... You keep on assuming I'm nicer than I am.Jeannie... I can't talk now because...Tell him I can't talk 'cause I'm on the phone with a director...I can't. I have to hang up.You know, I could get away now. But I've got a big meeting later. We'd better take two cars.See you later. Thanks again.I don't know whether I'm being a coward for telling you this way or brave for telling you period... Can you hear me?But I better talk fast because this is where my phone always kicks out... When we did your screentest... Can you hear me?Well, I sort of folded on you at the end.Matt?I did. Truly. But the discussion got sort of dumb. It was a question of sexiness.Well, sort of, yes.Well, I'll tell you. I certainly must think so pretty much because I feel great about where we're going now...Are you very mad at me?Matt. Matt. Matt.I'll talk fast. It's amazing news. Oliver Stone's been looking for a comedy and......he's doing my picture.Part of this involves you. He remembers you from 'Platoon' and wants to use you in this one. Got your attention, huh?I'm sorry.I guess it's because I'm just incredibly insensitive to all human needs. I'd ask you to save me, but I'm so far gone, I wouldn't want you to waste your time.You know, I don't have a kid or a mate or a talent. I got this. And shoot me if I think it's important.You think I'm a superficial jerk.

I'll just take your word that you're good.No. I'm serious. There's all different ways. Did you know Woody Allen never reads actors? He just looks at them, feels around a little and then decides who he wants. That's his way. Doesn't hear them do a line. I also have a way. What I do is interview first-- then read--maybe do it all over again the next day. I call up people the actor has worked with--check him out. If he's famous, I do an opinion survey to test how much people like him. If he's not famous, I put him on tape and show it to everyone I can grab. I believe in screen tests; I believe in replacing if the dailies are bad, in cutting people out if the previews aren't there. Because I'm not doing movies for theaters where they serve cappucino in the lobby. I'm doing popcorn movies. You want to know what I like? Come to my house, look at my lamps... you won't find it in my movies. In my movies, you'll find out what I know. I know how to do detail. What I don't know, I discover. Yesterday we finished mixing a movie--the last scene is in a field of windmills which blows up and all the blades of these windmills slice through the air, one of which hits a four-story tank of propane gas. A humongous explosion scene. I kept on saying 'louder', and they finally said to me they couldn't go louder without distortion. We went louder. We had to discover a thing, a filter, but we went louder. I don't question doing these things. I do them. So if you want to know if it's okay to do it differently--not to talk--to just read first... I say... Ask him--he's the director.Okay, let's do it. Do you have any questions?This part works tomorrow.I want you to do it wherever you're comfortable, but I'd prefer it if you were comfortable standing up.Go ahead.That's okay, he trusts me, uh... And we're just doing the first page.You didn't do the quack.The stage direction says for him to quack.Hopefully because it's funny.Then we're in trouble, because they're already fall down laughing at the teaser-trailer in fifty-two hundred and thirty theaters.Oh, God... why? Why?... What am I going to do?Look at me. You'd think I was a writer. I hired this kid as a production assistant. His father's a business manager... a few good clients.He's been driving for me two weeks... all he has to do is pick me up on time... he's twenty minutes late and I have a test screening in the valley. Everybody's gone from the office.Yeah....Not just today... believe me, there's no way you'll ever make it... You are going to fail. Listen, listen-- I know about this; you are going to be a failure.Let's get moving; you said you'd give me a lift.I'll give you a hundred and twenty dollars to take me... and it will still be a favor. Get out. Come on. Please. This is very important.You should leave time for that kind of thing.Yeah, I drive. I don't like to look for parking.Yoga shit. I feel like barbed wire. I don't know if you keep track, but I'm the sixth independent producer ever to have two big pictures scheduled for Christmas, and tonight we're testing the first one for the first time... You get it?Yes. I don't think I would have put it that way... but, yes...Keep driving. She runs the test screenings. Very smart. Very. She has a real case on me, but so far I've been keeping it in the bank.Go very slow.Yeah. Thanks.Let them in.I'm glad you came yourself instead of sending your staff.I wouldn't be surprised if tonight's screening is a monster. Could happen, right?Okay.Eisner just said he thinks the screening will be a monster.Make a guess how we did.Nothing good that happens can make it worth feeling the way I do now. Nothing.Who the hell are you? This is private.Oh. Can I get you some water?Now can I get you some water?How come you haven't said anything? This is great, right?What no?It was such a good score.Thanks. You want to eat something sometime?Good. I'll call you.You want to do this regularly for me? I was gonna offer, but I thought it would humiliate you.Okay, I got the cards to look at--I think I'll ride back here. Maybe I'll drop by your place tomorrow.Yeah, okay. You were very interesting to talk to. I swear to God. Honest. No kidding. You really were.Is it okay?I love this. This is what counts and this is where you count it.You phone all over--you know what movies they're waiting to see, whether your TV spots are working. You know what the country thinks....and it's accurate.And you can't fix it... right?Like?I gotta get back.I gotta get back.Is this urgent?'Cause I gotta go. I'm listening with an eighth of an ear now.Oh, I thought you took off in the middle of the night.No. It's Everett. This kid who used to work for me. He was always crazy to do his own movie.His movie not only opened to a three million dollar Friday--it's gotten great reviews.Listen. I'm tremendously worried about 'Ground Zero' because of the bad 'want to sees' you sent over. But that's just me being nervous over nothing, isn't it?Nothing good that happens tonight can make it worth feeling the way I do right now. Nothing. What do you think?So you think it'll score big?What are they doing?I can fix this... Get some narration written. . . You'll cut 30 minutes. It will come out like butter....a 47-minute movie... no, that won't work...Thanks for the support.Can you help?Go ahead.You look down.Thank you. I appreciate the support.Oh. What if 'Ground Zero' doesn't do well this weekend?What?Okay. Good. What is it?Is that it? Okay, send me...How about last night?You're selling very excellent. Very excellent presentation.Oh, please... What's the script?Why not? If you can test movies and premises and want-to-sees, why can't you test screen tests?What?Why did I rush to you? Because I felt like I had to... be with someone and you were closest. What's wrong?Look, I'm sorry if that came out...I'm just trying to say that one of the things I'm not great at is...No, I haven't.Had a conversation about shortcomings...Oh, yeah... But I didn't get what you meant by 'shortcomings.' Hey, if you think things like that, what are you doing here?I sure hope you're wrong.Not really.Okay. I was going to come in late anyway. I'll get one of the kids to drive me.So how do you think 'Ground Zero' will do tonight?How do you think my movie will do tonight?How bad can it be? We've got to have at least a two million dollar Friday. There's nothing else out there.I'm watching...Okay, come on... let's have our creative meeting right here.Very fuckable.Okay... that's her... What about him?You wouldn't want to fuck him?So you'd want to fuck him?A director can't make you hot if you're not hot. You'll end up with warm which is death.Let me ask you something... Would you fuck him?Let me stop you before you embarrass yourself.We all can do our little lectures on what things boil down to. Everybody else here was professional enough to come out and say... I'd fuck her... I wouldn't fuck him... and you're ducking it... I want you to forget the acting stuff and totally focus on the issue.We do have some kind of responsibility to the audience... You just saw his screentest... so, if this is the first time you saw the guy, do you come out thinking to yourself and your girl friends, 'I'd sure go to bed with him; oh God, would he be something.' Would you, Cathy?... I'm being real here.Okay, so let's keep looking.Cappuccino movies.I'm going to pieces... The picture was budgeted at 21 million and I spent 49 so they were a little mad at me to begin with. Now it doesn't open even with an Arby's Roast Beef tie-in... I mean, we only averaged 300 dollars a theater... they're going to think I'm Woody Allen.Thanks. But this is private. What about the exit survey? Did we do good with any group at all?Did we do well with any group at all?I'll see you later. Goodbye.I'm all alone... At least there's that.Yeah, sure. I have to stay inside during lunch hours now anyway--that's when everybody returns my calls because they're trying to miss me.Yeah. Thanks for the support.We look like jerks eating here this early. Everybody's going to think we couldn't get a reservation for the hot hours.I'm not afraid of them.Normal.Isn't it something that they have you testing the TV show?What are you talking about?Don't talk to me like this.She did okay... and don't worry about Matt... If the pilot sells, his kid will be making five thousand a week. So what do you know about 'People Get Hurt?'I knew. I knew. What the hell are you smiling for?I can't be with someone who's not rooting for me.Don't worry. I'm not that mad. I gotta do this.Sorry. I thought you were someone else.Nan, you know Victor and his wife... and Jay and his wife...Thank you. Thank you. We're very close.Excuse me, we're working our shit out... I'm sure it happened to you... you know, private stuff in public.Hello, Nan. I hope it's not too late to call.I'd like another chance.See. Nobody else gets me. You wanna have a little sex, honey?Hi, Matt, this is Burke. I'm sorry to bother you at home, but you know Nan... We were going out a little and I could use another guy's slant on what's just happened.Why? Did I catch you at a bad time?Oh, you mean about the screentest. The whole room thought you did good work.Yeah, look, I'm not going to bother you about my thing.Look at you. You're all here because of what's on the line for me tonight. Having this many people in your corner helps more than I would have ever guessed. I'm just very grateful that I made you come.What do you think?I had them bring in two busloads of people from black churches.I'm not comfortable with television anyway... it's too small... I'm much better at something with size... I don't do itzy. Even this movie of Cathy's--it's small... medium small. But with Stone it takes on a certain volume where I start to feel comfortable. I hate my life... ...in a way. I had a drink in my office. I'm confused. You're not saying anything. Is it because you're not listening or because I haven't stopped talking?Yeah. Oh, yeah. I forgot to say congratu...Which one you want?No. It's the crippled factory owner.Wait a second.A second--look, they're taking the cast picture now anyway.She doesn't look anything like the women I usually go with. And you know what they say, \"beauty fades.\" What they don't say is that it fades very slowly.No. Only I can do that. I want you to tell me what to feel... Look. I trust her. More important, everyone does. You have no idea how impressed people are with her. She's smart. She's interesting. You never know what she'll say next... Her work is amazing. I like talking to her. You have no idea what to expect next. I respect what she does more than any writer or director--sincerely-- much more unusual--much more important. So?Dance with me. On a business basis.I'll take it.Nervous... Look, let's move our thing in a more regular direction.Let me think. What if we go out this weekend... ...with your kid.Whose name is...
