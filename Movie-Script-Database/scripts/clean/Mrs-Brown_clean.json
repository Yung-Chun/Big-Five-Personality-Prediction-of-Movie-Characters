{"Mrs-Brown": {"BROWN": {"raw_line": "God save the Queen!!I'll stay with the pony, thank you. She's all the way from Deeside and she's not sure she likes you yet.I was due at a quarter past one. You're late.How will I know?How will I know what she requires?Who'll bring it to me?I need a man who knows where I am.That's not good enough.Aye, do.I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.Do you?So, is passing wind out of the question or do I need permission for that?Ma'am.Aye, ma'am.I am.She's well, too.I'm glad of it.I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.Archie.Yes, ma'am.Honest to God, I never thought to see you in such a state. You must miss him dreadfully.So?I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.I speak as I find, Archie.I think he nearly ruptured his truss.How much?Not bad, not bad.Sixty.Prince Leopold? Is he the one who bleeds all day? So what does his valet do? Wash his poultices for him?If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.It's only grief makes her like she is.She loved him.What?I'm not sure I do, Archie.Which one of us is she flirting with?Aye? Then she's obviously not got enough to do.I'm no wee spat, ARCHIE.Awaiting my orders.I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.No.Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her. What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!Is that the Queen's request?Yes, ma'am.Yes, ma'am.Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.And I intend to be there when she's ready.It's a fine spot, ma'am.If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.Aye, ma'am.Not now he doesn't. This is my place.My own.That's a tautology lad. If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally. That's understood.Are you dresser to Her Majesty?What's your name?Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary?Am I the only one eating?You could buy that lot for garden ornaments and still see change from ten guineas.Lift your foot, woman.My heart's in the Highlands, my heart is not here! My heart's in the Highlands a-chasing the deer! Chasing the wild deer and following the roe! My heart's in the Highlands wherever I go!One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges. It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it? Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.Aye, but will they?The woman's surrounded by fools! She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning. Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight.But I'm the only one she trusts.I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway. That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs. I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out. There's no stopping me now.What?Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.Are they worth reading?Who by?What does he know about the Highlands?That doesn't make him an expert.I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt. If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before. She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.That can wait till the weekend.It can wait. Anything else?If I thought she wasn't up to it, I wouldn't let her go, would I?It's the Queen's decision.I think you should go now. You've tired your mother enough.There's really no need for this.She thinks if she warned you, you'd go pouring water on the fire and stuffing the knitting under the sofa.They're ready now.Ah, well...... so Grant here and myself are riding over Lochnagar and the rain's pouring down in sheets and all we're thinking about is getting home for a drink, when through the gloom Grant spots a couple of poachers. He gives me a shout and we chase them down towards the loch until Grant has your men up against the stacks and he's shouting and cursing at them, \"Why are you poaching on Royal land?!\" And one of the little fellas looks up at him and says, \"coz we've come up in the world.\"Ah, pipe down, man. The woman's fine.We took a nip of whiskey.Aye.I heard something.I won't be long.This close enough for you? Go on! On your way! You filthy scavengers!You leave her alone, do you hear?!If I catch the miserable by-blow who told those men where she'd be, then I'll hang his balls to dry on Jock Wemyss, so I will!!What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised!You'll talk when I'm finished!That kind of disloyalty will not be tolerated in this house, is that clear? I said, is that clear?!If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.Don't think I can't persuade her.This is a slur on her good name.Nobody has any rights over me.You'll regret saying that.She's busy.She's away to Windsor tomorrow. Talk to her there.Are you deaf as well as stupid?I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?Whom you address.Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.LEAVE US ALONE, WHY DON'T YOU!!You! What's your business here?!Well, don't stand where you shouldn't!I ordered it. It's for your own safety.Aye. But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.I'll decide when it's exaggerated.Nothing's the matter.Hey, Barney.It's cold out there tonight, Barney.Yeah, there's a good girl. Have you had a look at this hoof? She was limping badly. I think there might be a stone in it.Good man. And is she all right?Good. She's a good girl. Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl. And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?Are you all right, Barney?Oh, aye...And she sent no word down?She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.I'm getting dressed.I've got my duties to attend to.She'll be worried about me.I can't let her down now, Archie.Oh, I'm much more than that.You watch your tongue.You know nothing about her!From the Queen!My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter. To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R. Best friend!She means it.Get out. Out!OUT!!Yes, ma'am?Yes, ma'am.Yes, ma'am.Ma'am?Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this. I leave for Deeside --I promise.Time for your walk.What brings you here?What do you know about the Highlands?Do you hunt?Dare say you can be taught.If you hunt, you kill.Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head. Then imagine it's Gladstone.... Back doors, West Wing.Side doors, East Wing.Louder, girl!Kitchen and lower house.Back and upper corridors.Front door. Checked and locked.There's not a soul here cares about that wee woman's safety except me! She'd die in a ditch if I wasn't there to look out for her --It's a diary.What do you take me for?I'm all right. I just need to rest up a wee bit. The room ... You don't have to stay.I can't move to tidy.I'm not having some prattler going through my things.She needs me, Archie. She canna do without me, she said it to my face. How can I stop now?You sent for me.I don't think about it.I'm fine.It's nothing.I'm not married.This is the top.I wouldn't know.What I do, I do for my Queen.Maybe, once.Why?I do what I do.Aye.I said. I serve the Queen.To see her safe.Why do you think I keep her here?So...?Her mind is set. She won't change now.They don't see it.The threat. I tell them, but they don't see it.Too busy looking after themselves.No loyalty.I promised to protect her from people like you.She'll never understand it.She'll think I betrayed her.We can't always have what we wish.If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.Have I ever let you down before--?I'm breaking no promises!For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...! All I've ever thought about is you!Because I have to! (pause Will you no listen to me, woman?I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard. In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --NO!!We should not live in expectation of contentment. Fifteen years of vigilance will not guarantee peace of mind. Yesterday, intruders were again reported in the South Wing. I believe my prompt arrival may have averted any crisis, but it was a timely reminder. It is a great comfort to me that my efforts in securing the Queen's safety over the years have not been in vain. Certainly Her Majesty sends me no word that she's dissatisfied. And I feel sure that if she were unhappy she would have found the occasion to speak to me in person, as she has so often done in the past.What is it?God save the Queen!!Someone has to look after you. It could've been someone. It was before.Don't be silly, woman.Not too near.", "clean_line": "god save queen ll stay pony thank way deeside sure likes quarter past late know know requires ll bring need man knows good aye came queen request ll orders passing wind question need permission ma aye ma glad ve family ma apart brothers sisters archie yes ma honest god thought state miss dreadfully telling woman feel god sake speak archie think nearly ruptured truss bad bad prince leopold bleeds day valet wash poultices looking promotion picked healthier ones grief makes like loved sure archie flirting aye obviously got wee spat archie awaiting orders come way sit arse tell majesty husband house getting air hell point queen request yes ma yes ma think majesty wrong poor soul needed fresh air intend ready fine spot ma prince albert today tell thing aye ma place tautology lad queen arranges ve need personally understood dresser majesty seen balmoral mary wouldn happen know queen reading recreation mary eating buy lot garden ornaments change guineas lift foot woman heart highlands heart heart highlands chasing deer chasing wild deer following roe heart highlands box biscuits box drop tablets box pralines sixteen chocolate sponges order week anybody bother check travel way balmoral luxuries actually enjoys aye woman surrounded fools packed ready leave seven thirty tomorrow morning knowing lot ll dressing trusts ninety pounds year plus seventy pounds pile tartan wearing page stairs gets job toffs majesty highland servant indoors stopping craobhan geanmchno fhiadhaich worth reading know highlands expert groom horse admired groom needs grooming woman people think shouldn matter aye want good opinion sure oblige ll away friday clock evening visit grants glasalt journey day distractions night ll light supper private drawing room retire early wait till weekend wait thought wasn wouldn let queen decision think ve tired mother need thinks warned pouring water stuffing knitting sofa ready ah grant riding lochnagar rain pouring sheets thinking getting home drink gloom grant spots couple poachers gives shout chase loch grant men stacks shouting cursing poaching royal land little fellas looks says coz ve come world ah pipe man woman fine took nip whiskey aye heard won long close way filthy scavengers leave hear catch miserable blow told men ll hang balls dry jock wemyss happens john brown business queen security compromised ll talk finished kind disloyalty tolerated house clear said clear sacked think persuade slur good rights ll regret saying busy away windsor tomorrow talk deaf stupid said deaf stupid address entitled opinion leave business stand shouldn ordered safety aye fenians reported mainland ll decide exaggerated matter hey barney cold tonight barney yeah good girl look hoof limping badly think stone good man right good good girl aren yeah lovely girl know queen riding tomorrow right barney oh aye sent word ll think fault keeping getting dressed ve got duties attend ll worried let archie oh watch tongue know queen lips message better christmas love en letter best friend best friend best friend means yes ma yes ma yes ma ma having considered position court come conclusion best majesty resign foreseen majesty understand mind changed leave deeside promise time walk brings know highlands hunt dare taught hunt kill remember tight shoulder absorb kick aim head imagine gladstone doors west wing doors east wing louder girl kitchen lower house upper corridors door checked locked soul cares wee woman safety die ditch wasn look diary right need rest wee bit room stay tidy having prattler going things needs archie canna said face stop sent think fine married wouldn know queen maybe aye said serve queen safe think mind set won change threat tell busy looking loyalty promised protect people like ll understand ll think betrayed wish duty safety served end aye let breaking promises god sake woman trying safe took riding come rain shine knew right kept bairns bit peace saw safe home home know ve thought pause listen woman recommend majesty uses covered carriage horse guard event disturbance ensure live expectation contentment years vigilance guarantee peace mind yesterday intruders reported south wing believe prompt arrival averted crisis timely reminder great comfort efforts securing queen safety years vain certainly majesty sends word dissatisfied feel sure unhappy occasion speak person past god save queen look ve silly woman near"}, "VICTORIA": {"raw_line": "How many?Just them?Whom?That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex. Silk suits you well. But you are not eating enough. One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.Mr Brown.You are here safely.You are well?And the pony?Your family sent cards. It was much appreciated.My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you. He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way. I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.Yes. You have a brother in service here, do you not? I forget his name.Yes. That will be company for you.You do not - he ... get him out. Get him out. Get him out!Who is that?What is he doing there?I made no request to go out riding today. How long has he been there?Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard. I have no wish to go riding.Please make sure it does not happen again.Mr Brown.You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.Then why do you persist in doing it?The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.Prince Albert was going to build a bench here. He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.He thought so, yes.In everything I do and everything I say, I try to think, as much as possible, what he would do, or say, if he were here now. My Private Secretary wishes me to return to public duties--Sir Henry is not alone. They all wish it. The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?Yes.I have some letters in the saddle bag. I wish to read them.I cannot read them like that.You will hand them to me as I require.Why?No. I shall be out walking.On no account.Gesture?No dinners, Bertie. Why are you dressed for outdoors?Cold is good-- Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!Cold is good!Why am I being lectured in this way?!I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....... Least of all my son. It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!I wish to take the Princesses for a swim.The turns I have been taking in the grounds have proved most beneficial to me, and Brown thinks that salt water will do me good.Don't potter, children. Swim.What are those?Those, over there, there.Craobhan-geanmchno... How can I possibly say that with a straight face?!I am thinking of publishing my \"Highland Journals.\"I am told so.Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.I do not do it for others. But Ponsonby thinks they are good.Of course I shall say what I have to say. I always do.What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming. Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.I mention you in them.In particular, the occasion when Albert was alive; the Royal Carriage overturned during a storm and you demonstrated such loyal service in returning the Queen and the Princesses safely to Balmoral.For friendship.It is a disgusting habit, Bertie. It should be discouraged.It is quite late enough.Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already. He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.And that is my last word on the matter.I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.Mr Grant. How good it is to see you.Mrs Grant. How is your knee? Has the pain eased a little?Good. Oh and here are Douglas and John. Haven't you grown?I know that! That's Cairn Lochan. We picnicked there once, did we not, John?Oh, I'm so sorry ...We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant. It was most agreeable.And now I am back.To keep out the cold.Thank you, John.What is it, John? John?Read it.Read it!Who told them that?Why not?No-one should think themselves wiser than me! It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning. It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded! It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?! I am not a fool. I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert. And now they attack Brown too.I will not give him up to them.Must they always follow us?Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next.Am I not safe enough with you, John?The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.Is anything the matter, John? John?Well?Why?Unwell?Has he been hurt?You may go.I am tired.What is it?From whom?My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.What do they want?My husband tried always to make me think more subtly. Of course he taught me so much and I can never repay my debt to him, or the love I feel, even now. But, in truth, I think I am someone who can only feel things while they are alive to me. For that reason, I know I do not have a subtle mind. I know that. But I work hard and I try to do my duty. However, I have noticed of late that my feelings of grief are not so strong and -- that I find myself leaning more upon the comfort of living friends. Friends close to me now.Sir Henry.Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort. Do I make myself clear?You may go.I would like to get down.John?I was told you were in a fight.Has someone seen to those bruises?Yes?I do not accept.The Queen forbids it. I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you. Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be. Please.Promise me you won't let them send me back.How dare the Irish break with the Anglicans? If Albert were alive today he would never allow the Crown to give up Church patronage. No, the Irish must be told, very firmly, to stay exactly where they are. It is the thin edge of the wedge, Mr Disraeli. Next, you will be telling me that the Crown no longer governs this nation.But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.Then they may read about me.Is that not enough?I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli. You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.I stay here because I am happy. Is that such a terrible crime?This is my good John Brown.I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral.I received a letter today from Mr Disraeli. Parliament is calling for my return to public duties. Why won't they let us be?He insists that the country expects me to preside over the opening of the new session. I refuse to offer sustenance to enable his weakening grip. Besides, you know how much I should hate it. It frightens me.John?Duty?! You talk about duty?!I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time ---- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!I will not hear any more about my safety!! You made me a promise and now you have broken it!Then why send me back to them?!Do not presume to talk to your Queen in that manner.Doctor Jenner, I feel unwell. I shall retire to my chamber. Please attend me presently.Where is my son?Why is he not here?Then why are you not with him?What is the matter with him?No. You are mistaken. Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever. I asked what was wrong with my son.Why was I not informed?How ill is he?Alex?He is not well, ma'am.I must go to him.We must leave at once.Should the good Lord see fit to spare my son, I will order a mass to be celebrated at St. George's. The people must share with their Queen, her prayers and hopes for their future King.I will ride to St. George's in an open carriage. It is time the Queen was seen by her public.I intend Brown to be rewarded with a special medal cast in gold. It will be called The Devoted Service Medal.How long has he been this sick?Why was I not told earlier?You should never have gone out in such foul weather.Yes. Yes it was.My Ministers are as impertinent as ever. Dispatches are now so numerous, they come in a trunk. Sometimes I do believe they will never stop. Endless letters...I know I have not always been the loyal friend you deserved, John.
