Hey, Perry!Do me a favor and square away the mud hose and those cable slings. This place is starting to look like my apartment.I'm coming. Keep your pantyhose on.Brigman here. Kirkhill? What's going on? I am calm. I'm a calm person. Is there some reason why I shouldn't be calm?Son of a bitch.All divers. Drop what you're doing. Everybody out of the pool.Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security. Now you know exactly as much as I do. So just get your gear off and get up to control. There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.Don't you guys have your own stuff for this type of thing?Look, I don't know what kind of a deal you guys worked out with the company, but my people are not qualified for this... they're oil workers.You can send down whoever you like, but I'm the toolpusher on this rig, and when it comes to the safety of these people, there's me... then there's God. Understand? If things get dicey, I'm pulling the plug.Fred, huh? I don't know. Hurricanes should be named after women.Hi, Lins. I thought you were in Houston.Wasn't up to me.Your rig?Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it. So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.I'm switching off now.Bye.God, I hate that bitch.Oh no... you gotta be kidding me.Well, well. Mrs. Brigman.You never did like being called that, did you?Who else?I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down. Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.Then why'd you come down?Wow, you're right! Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves. Coulda been a disaster.You wanna know what I think?I think you were worried about me.No, I think you were. Come on, admit it.Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years with me.My bunk's the only one I can guarantee won't be occupied. You can grab a couple hours before we get there.I don't know. Divorce ain't final. Forgot to take it off.Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it. The Suit.So what about \"Michael\" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW. You still seeing him?What happened?I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.Shit.Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.Look, it's three AM. These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep. You better start cutting them some slack.Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around. It won't work. You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.Shut up and get your gear on.Okay so far.Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.Let's go, guys.Take it slow, stay on the line, and stay in sight. Watch for hatches that could close on you, or any loose equipment that could fall.How you guys doing?We're here now. Let's get her done.Okay, Cat, Lew, Sonny. You guys stay on this deck. Hook you line onto mine. Any problem, you tug my line. Two pulls. Jammer, you're with me.Missile compartment. Those are the launch tubes.Hey, you okay?Deep and slow, big guy. Deep and slow. Just breathe easy.I'm taking you back out.Okay, Jammer. No problem. You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights. We'll stay in voice contact. Just hold onto the rope. Five more minutes. Okay?Jammer? Answer me, buddy, JAMMER?!Hang on, big guy. Hand on!He's convulsing!SHIT, it's stuck... goddamnit!Yeah, yeah... yeah. It's turning.We gotta get him out of here. Come on! Hang on, buddy.CAB ONE! CAB ONE! Meet me at Flatbed! This is a diver emergency!! Do you copy? Lindsey?!Whattya think?Did you get anything on the cameras. Video or anything?Fine. Be that way.But you think it's something else. What? One of ours?Whose then? Lindsey? Talk to me...His mixture got screwed up. He panicked and pranged his regulator.What do you think he saw?What's the matter with you?Hippy, just relax. You're making the women nervous.Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.Goddamnit! D'you tell him we need it right now?Unbelievable.It's on every channel.Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.This ain't no drill, slick. Make me proud.Topside, topside... pay out some slack, we're getting dragged!What? Say again.Rig for impact! Seal all exterior hatches. Move it! Let's go!Heeyy!! HHHEEEYYY!!Forget it, Sonny. They're gone.Did you find Wilhite?What's the scoop, ace?Need some help?What about O-2?The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.Hey, Lins... I'm glad your here.Where're you?That's it then. Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry. Jesus.Yeah, for now. Our first priority's to get something to breathe.There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months. I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers. So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests. If you were married you got a state-room. Otherwise it was bunks.It was alright for a while, you know. But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!She didn't leave me... she just left me behind.Lins, how're you doing? Lindsey?Nice shot, Lins.If you say so. It could be anything.Lindsey, will you step into my office for a minute...Jesus, Lindsey--Look. I'm just trying to hold this situation together. I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.No.How can I go on a feeling? You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?I can't, Lindsey. I'm sorry. How can I?'Fish'?Take the first watch in sonar. Hippy, you handle the exterior surveillance. One Night, see if you can get that transmitter working for me, okay?Why bring it here?Lindsey! Wait a second--Emergency! Maintenance room B. Emergency!Let her go. Do it... right now.Chill out, Lindsey!!Nothing. We were just leaving. Weren't we?Lins, stay away from that guy. I mean it.Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command. He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis. And he's got a nuclear weapon. So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?I think it likes you.You done impressing yourself, ace?Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water.We have to stop him! Schoenick!!Thanks. How you feeling, big guy?Uh, okay, right. You can tell us about it later. Let's go.He's jammed the mechanism.Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side.Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?Hafta... go on to... the moonpool. Only way.Okay, Cat. You head back.Get the door!Gimme a hand!Get the rest of my gear. Grab that hat there... let's go guys! Come on, come on!Helmet... helmet! Work fast.Can we negotiate later? There's Big Geek.Go after it! We gotta catch it!Not good enough. We still gotta catch Big Geek.You totaled it, huh?It's flooding like a son of the bitch.Try again.Wonderful. There's some light from somewhere...Good hundred yards, I'd say.Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us. We better get this flooding stopped.Somewhere behind this panel. Hold this.Can't get to it. Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?Nothing. Son of a bitch. All I need's a goddamn crescent wrench.Son of a bitch!Okay... okay. We gotta get you out of here.I don't know how!I know! I know! But we better come up with something.Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time. Look at this... Time I get back you'll be--Alright, put this on.Don't argue, goddamnit, just--Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--FUCK LOGIC!!What's the plan?WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??It is insane.Jesus, I don't believe this is happening.Oh God, Lins... I--NOOOOO!!!Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?Meet me in the moonpool. Move fast.Turn her over!Come on, hurry! Gimme the de-fib...Jesus. Gimme those, come on. Catfish, move it, man! Come on... come on!Is that it? Is this right?All right. Do it!Do it again, One Night. Zap her again!Aw. Christ... come on, baby. Again! Do it again!Come on, One Night... what are you waiting for?No! NO! She's not... her heart is strong, she wants to live... can't you see that? Come on, Lins. Come on, baby! Zap her again! Do it... DO IT!Come on, breath! Goddamn it, you bitch, you never backed down from anything in life... now fight!Fight, Goddamnit!FIGHT!!Come on, Lins.

Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work. We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake. I can't believe you let them grab my rig!My rig. I designed the damn thing.You wimp. I had a lot riding on this. They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--Virgil, you wiener! You never could stand up to fight. You--Let's go, gentlemen! We either launch now or we don't launch.Take her up, Byron!Bates is sick. Besides I've got more hours in this thing than he does. A little change of plan.Just hold your water, okay? So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?Roger. There's only one way it's going to happen...Touchdown. The crowd goes wild. Explorer... Cab Three. We are styling.Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.None other.Couldn't stay away. You running mixture for us? Good. Couldn't ask for better.Get comfortable. The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down. The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.Don't call me that, okay... I hate that. Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS...Very good. About one person in twenty just can't handle it. They go buggo. They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.Oh... chamber runs. Uh huh, that's good. Well, hey... you guys know any songs?Hey, was there a wall here before? I don't remember a wall here. Oh, Jammer! Hi.Those guys are about a much fun as a tax audit.Hippy, you're going to give that rat a disease.Not for long.Not even when it meant something. Is that One Night up in Flatbed?Look, I didn't come down here to fight.You need me. Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do. What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off? What would have you done?Not particularly. Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.That must be it.I was worried about the rig. I've got over four years invested in this project.You've got to have priorities.What are you still wearing that for?I haven't worn mine in months.Do you always have to call him that? The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick. His name is Michael.No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.Bud, why are you doing this? It's not part of you life any more.You're right, Bud. It was just that simple. Aren't you clever? You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.AAAARRRGGH!Shit.Com-check, everybody. Flatbed, you on line?Cab Three?What's you depth, Cab Three?Going over the wall. Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.The magnetometer is pegged. Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet. Are you sure you got the depth right on this?Uh, yeah, roger that... uh, found it.Neutron counter's not showing very much.Copy that, continuing forward. You just want me to get shots of everything, right?Copy that.How many are there?That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?Jesus Christ... this is World War Three in a can.Copy you, Bud. On my way.No. Look, forget it. I don't want to talk about it.I don't know what I saw. Okay? Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine. It's a Russian submersible. No problem.No.Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--But what did he see that made him panic?I don't know. I DON'T KNOW!Figured that out for yourself, did you?Cute, Virgil.Bud, this is big time.We're heading right for the drop off!Got it! It's dropping straight to us.Oh shit.Hey! Get on this hose, you turkeys!No! Hold it on me!I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses. I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.Thanks. No, I can handle it. Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters. In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.Brace yourself. We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.I can extend that. There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module. I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.Yeah? Well I'm not.Cat, you tie onto this manifold. There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.Yeah, Hippy, I read you. What's the matter?Catfish... I got a problem here. You there? Catfish?You better not say you missed that.Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here. You can see how it's kind of zigging around.I'm telling you what is there. You're just not hearing. The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan. There's something down there. Something not... us.Not us. Not human. Get it? Something non- human, but intelligent...A non-terrestrial intelligence.Hippy, do me a favor... stay off my side.Bud, something really important is happening here.Who's hysterical? Nobody's hysterical!I saw something! I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did. I'm sorry.I need you to believe me, Bud. Look at me. Do I seem stressed out? Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?Bud, this is me, Lindsey. Okay? You know me better than anybody in the world. Now watch my lips... I saw these things. I touched one of them. And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided. It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light. Bud, you have to trust me... please. I don't think they mean us harm. I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.Gimme a break! Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench! Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig! With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here? Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?You're right... I don't. I just need to know that this thing is out of here! You hear me, Roger Ramjet?Bullshit, you can't do that. Oww... goddamnit!You dumb jarhead motherf--He's got the shakes?Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?Let's go for it. We could get lucky.No. Just you and me. We get some proof, then tell them. Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.Virgil, turn on your side.It's trying to communicate.Seawater.Show off.Okay, raise your hand if you think that was a Russian water-tentacle. Lieutenant? No? Well, a breakthrough.They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level. They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever. Put it under intelligent control.They're curious, maybe. We could be the first people they've seen up close.I think they're from 'you know'. Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure. No light.Oh my God... Oh no... Please, you can't. Coffey, think about what you're doing... for God's sake--Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...... he's about to declare war on an alien species, Schoenick, just when they're trying to make contact with us. I think I'm reaching him.See?Now what?Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.He couldn't be that dumb. The guy's a trained killer. Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.BUUUUUD!!NOOO!!Forget that... go for Big Geek!Get in!You owe me one, Virgil.You did okay, back there. I was fairly impressed.Not in this thing.Yeah. So sue me.You noticed.Deepcore, Deepcore, this is Cab One, over.Deepcore, this is Cab One. We need assistance, over. Deepcore, this--Well, that's that.Over there. It's the rig.They'll come out after us.You see where it's coming in?I don't know, look around.Calm down, Bud.How?We've only got one suit.Aaargh!! I'm freezing!Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.What, you growing gills all of a sudden? You got it on, keep it on.No way! Forget it. Not an option.NO!! Now be logical, Bud, you're--Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me. Right? So I got a plan...I drown, you tow me back to the rig--Look, this water is only a couple degrees above freezing. I drown. I go into deep hypothermia... my blood like icewater. I can maybe be revived after ten, fifteen minutes. You got all the stuff to do it on the rig.It's the only way, Bud. Now trust me.Tell me later.This is maybe not such a great plan, is it?Hold me. Hold me, Bud... I'm so scared...Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?Hi, tough guy. I guess it worked, huh?I've been better. Next time it's your turn, okay?No, Bud, no... not you.Can you hear me okay? Try your keypad.I already have, moron.We're right here with you, Bud. Your depth is 3800 feet. You're doing fine.Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive. Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.8500 feet, Bud. Everything okay?Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.Big baby.Don't forget Bud, you're being graded on spelling as well as sentence structure, so concentrate, okay? Bud, I... uh, there's some things I want to say. It's hard for me. I'm not of those softy, gooey- center-type people. It's not easy, you know, being a cast-iron bitch. It takes discipline and years of training. A lot of people don't appreciate that.But is wasn't all bad. I know that. You remember that bike trip... we rode the Honda up through Oregon? It took me a week to get my hair untangled, but I've never been happier. It was the most... free... I've ever felt. I'm sorry I can't tell you these things to your face.Shut up, Hippy. Bud, how you doing?What kind of luminous things, Bud?Bud, it's the pressure. Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice. Just listen to my voice.I'm not going away, Bud. I'm right here, right here with you. This is Lindsey, Bud. I'm right here.I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...You remember that time, you were pretty drunk, you probably don't remember... the power went out at the old apartment, the one on Orange Street... and we were staring at that one little candle, and I said something really dumb like that candle is me, like every one of us is out there alone in the dark in this life...... and you lit another candle and put it beside mine and said \"that's me\"... and we stared at the two candles, and then we... well, if you remember any of it, I'm sure you remember the next part. Bud, there are two candles in the dark. I'm with you. I'll always be with you.Bud? You hangin' in there? Talk to me, Bud. Are you okay?What kind of light?Would we see the flash?Drop you weights and start back now! The gauge could be wrong...No! You can make it! You hear me? Drop your weights... you... can breathe shallow... you... it could be wrong--Oh God, Virgil, please...Love you.No it's not.It says... \"VIRGIL BRIGMAN BACK ON THE AIR/HAVE SOME NEW FRIENDS DOWN HERE/I GUESS THEYVE BEEN HERE AWHILE/ THEYVE LEFT US ALONE BUT IT BOTHERS THEM TO SEE US HURTING EACH OTHER/GETTING OUT OF HAND LATELY\"\"THEY WANT US TO GROW UP A BIT AND PUT AWAY CHILDISH THINGS/OF COURSE ITS JUST A SUGGESTION.\"We should be dead.
