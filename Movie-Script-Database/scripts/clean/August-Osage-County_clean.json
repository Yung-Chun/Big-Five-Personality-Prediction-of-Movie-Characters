Hello.You tell me she's a woman. Wo-man. Whoa-man.Oh, you hire women's now the thing. I thought you meant the other woman.In the int'rest of ...civil action, your par-tic-u-lars way of speak- king, I thought you meant you had thought a whoa-man to be HIRED!Hello.I'm sorry. Like this.You're very pretty.Are you an Indian? \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 6.Do you think I'm pretty?Like...this? Like this?You're the house now. I'm sorry, I took some medicine for my mussss... muscular.Why don't you go fuck a fucking sow's ass?I'm sorry. I'll be sickly sweet. I'm soooooooo sweet. In-el-abrially sweet....You've been out there...?...You're going out yourself...? *Stop that...You call Barb? What'd she say?What'd you tell her?Did you tell her how long he'd been missing?What did she say?Goddamn it, Ivy, what did she say?You're hopeless. Goddamn your father for putting me through this. Seen that office of his, all that mess? I can't make heads or tails of it. He hired this Indian for some goddamn reason and now I have a stranger in my house. What's her name?This house is falling apart, something about the basement or the sump pump or the foundation. I don't know anything about it. I can't do this by myself.What did she say?She'll be a big fat help, just like you. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 12.I need Barb.What did you do to your hair?You had it straightened. Why would anybody do that?You're the prettiest of my three girls, but you always look like a schlub. Why don't you wear makeup?All women need makeup. Don't let anybody tell you different. The only woman who was pretty enough to go without makeup was Elizabeth Taylor and she wore a ton. Stand up straight.Your shoulders are slumped and your hair's all straight and you don't wear makeup. You look like a lesbian.You could get a decent man if you spruced up. A bit, that's all I'm saying.There are a lot of losers out there, don't think I don't know that. But just because you got a bad one last time doesn't mean --Barry was an asshole. I warned you from the jump, first time you brought him over here in his little electric car with his stupid orange hair and that turban --You work at a college. Don't tell me there aren't people coming through the door of that library every day.They still have teachers at TU, right? They did when your father taught there.How many was that?Like a son-of-a-bitch. My tongue is on fire.Is anybody supposed to smoke?Just leave it alone.Course I'm scared. And you are a comfort, sweetheart. Thank God one of my girls stayed close to home.She means to come in here and tell me what's what.He smokes a lot of grass.He smokes a lot of grass.They checked the hospitals, no Beverly.No, the sheriff, the Gilbeau boy.The boat's missing.I asked the sheriff to send a deputy out to the dock to check if anybody had seen him and his boat is gone.Barb...Yes. Hi, Bill.I'm just so scared.Well, look at you.You're just the prettiest thing. Thank you for coming to see me.She had it straightened. Barbara, or Bill, it doesn't matter, I need you to go through Beverly's things, help me with this paperwork.No, now that desk of his is such a mess and I get confused -- \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 25.You're going back to Tulsa?How about Little Charles, can't he take care of the dogs?No, that's where what's-her-name lives.She's the Indian who lives in my attic.Saturday morning. The Indian girl made us biscuits and gravy. We ate some, he walked out the door, this door right there. Got into his truck. And that was it.I went to bed Saturday night, got up Sunday... still no Beverly. I didn't make much of it, thought he'd gone out on a bender.I never said anything to him about his drinking, never got on him about it. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 28.Yes, Sunday. No sign. I started getting worried, don'tcha know. That's when I got worked up about that safety deposit box. We kept an awful lot of cash in that box, some expensive jewelry. I had a diamond ring in that box appraised at seven thousand dollars --Well, I know what you'll say about this, but, your father and I had an urge-ment... arrangement. If something were to ever happen to one of us, the other one would go empty that box.Right, that's right --I knew you would disapprove --I had to wait for the bank to open on Monday. And after I emptied that box, I called the police and reported him missing. Monday morning.I didn't want to worry you, honey --You mean like a fight.No. And we fought enough... you know... but no, he just left.That's nice of you to say.Oh. That man. What I first fell of with -- fell in love with, you know, was his mystery. I thought it was sexy as hell. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 30.You knew he was the smartest one in the room, knew if he just said something... knock you out. But he'd just stand there, little smile on his face... not say a word. Sexy.He hired this woman. He didn't ask me, just hired this woman to come live in our house. Few days before he left.She's a stranger in my house. There's an Indian in my house.I don't know what to say to an Indian.Who makes that decision?They aren't any more native than me.What's wrong with Indian?Let's just call the dinosaurs \"Native Americans\" while we're at it.He hired a cook. It doesn't make any sense. We don't eat.Nice for you, now. But you'll be gone soon enough, never to return.When was the last time you were here?You do not write -- \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 32.Because you're \"dutiful.\"I don't care about you two. I'd like to see my granddaughter every now --But your father. You broke his heart when you moved away.I'm sure you'd prefer to think that Santy Claus brought you presents at Christmas, too. If you'd had more than one child, you'd know a parent always has favorites. Mattie Fae was my mother's favorite. Big deal. I got used to it. You were your Daddy's favorite. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 33.Broke his heart.You're wrong there. You never would've gotten Beverly Weston out of Oklahoma.`S what he told you.Beverly didn't say terrible things behind your back --He just told me he's disappointed in you because you settled. He thought * you had talent, as a writer. *Oh, horseshit, horseshit, let's all say horseshit. Say horseshit, Bill.Excuse me.A muscle relaxer.I don't know what you're talking about.Stop yelling at me!It's not the same thing. I didn't have a reason.I'm not hooked on anything.I'm not. I'm in pain.Yes, because my mouth burns from the chemotheeeahh --Yes, I'm in pain. I have got... gotten cancer. In my mouth. And it burns like a... bullshit. And Beverly's disappeared and you're yelling at me.You couldn't come home when I got cancer but as soon as Beverly disappeared you rushed back --Did you call them? I dig in call them.Inna esther?Inna esther broke. `N pays me `em...sturck...struck.Izza story. Barely's back. Did sum Beer-ley come home?Gizza cig... some cigezze? Cig-zezz, cig-zizz... cig-uhzzz...In the archa, archa-tex? I'm in the bottom. Inna bottom of them. Mm, good beat, right?Barbara?! Is Barbara here?!Mm, good beat, right? Idn't it's a good beat? \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 47.Mmmm, I been on the music... pell man onna sheriff. Armen in tandel s'lossle, s'lost? Lost?! From the day, the days. Am Beerly... and Beverly lost?And then you're here. And Barbara, and then you're here, and Beverly, and then you're here, and then you're here, and then you're here, and then you're here, and then you're here...It won't kill you to try it on -- \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 53.You don't have a style, that's the point.New York. On the first book tour.You wore a suit to your father's funeral. A woman doesn't wear a suit to a funeral.You look like a magician's assistant.Don't discourage him now --Stop being so sensitive.All this shit's going. I don't plan to spend the rest of my days looking at what used to be. I want that shit in the office gone, I want these clothes I'm never going to wear gone. I mean look at these fucking shoes -- Even if I didn't fall on my face, can you imagine anything less attractive, my swollen ankles and varicose veins? And my toenails, good God: anymore they could dig through cement.Look at me. Look at me.I was beautiful. Not anymore.One of those lies we tell to give us comfort. Women are beautiful when they're young and not after. Men can still preserve their sex appeal into old age. Not those men like you see with shorts and those little purses around their waists. Some men can maintain a weary masculinity. Women just get old and fat and wrinkly.Think about the last time you went to the mall and saw some sweet little gal and thought she's a cute trick. What makes her that way? Taut skin, firm boobs, an ass above her knees.You're about as sexy as a wet card- board box, Mattie Fae, you and me both. Look, wouldn't we be better off if we stopped lying about these things and told the truth? \"Women aren't sexy when they're old.\" I can live with that. Can you live with that?The world is round. Get over it. Now try this dress on.You don't know how to attract a man. I do. That's something I always --I'm not talking about today, dummy, this is something you can wear --You said you weren't looking for a man -- \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 60.Who is it?Are you in love, Ivy?August... your month. Locusts are raging, \"Summer psalm become summer wrath.\" `Course it's only August out there. In here... who knows? All right... okay. \"The Carriage held but just Ourselves,\" dum-de-dum...mm, best I got... Emily Dickenson's all I got... something something, \"Horse's Heads Were Toward Eternity...\"That's for me. One for me.For My Violet...For the girls, God love `em.Barb... will you put this?I see you gentlemen have stripped down to your shirt fronts. I thought we were having a funeral dinner, not a cockfight.Someone should probably say grace. Barbara?By default.Barb, have any use for that sideboard?That sideboard there, you have any interest in that? \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 75.I'm getting rid of a lot of this stuff and I thought you might want that sideboard.Mm. Maybe Ivy'll take it.Clearing all this out of here. I want to have a brand new everything.Suit yourself.I haven't tried much of it, yet --`S what she's paid for.Y'all did know she's getting paid, right?Ingest what? It's fur?I thought she said --\"Where's the meat?\" Isn't that some TV commercial, the old lady says, \"Where's the meat?\"\"Where's the meat?!\" \"Where's the meat?!\" \"Where's the meat?!\"Ehhhhh! I give it a... Ehhhhh!Too much talk about poetry, teaching. He hadn't written any poetry to speak of since `65 and he never liked teaching worth a damn. Nobody talked about the good stuff. Man was a world- class alcoholic, more'n fifty years. Nobody told the story about that night he got wrangled into giving a talk at that TU alumni dinner... Drank a whole bottle of Ron Bocoy White Rum -- don't know why I remember that -- and got up to give this talk, and he fouled himself! Comes back to our table with this huge --Who are you? \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 79.Hide-the-what?Hide-a-burrr...German, you're a German.That's peculiar, Karen, to bring a date to your father's funeral. I know the poetry was good, but I wouldn't have really considered it date material --I don't really see that happening, do you? Steve. That right? Steve?You ever been married before?More'n once? \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 80.You should pretty much have it down by now, then.I had that one pegged. I mean, look at him, you can tell he's been married.Karen! Shame on you! Don't you know not to say Cowboys and Indians? You played Cowboys and Native Americans, right Barb?Lemme alone --Y'know...if I ever called my mom a liar? She would've knocked my goddamn head off my shoulders.You girls know there's a will.We took care of it some time back.I want to talk about it. What about what I want to talk about, that count for anything? Bev made some good investments, believe it or not, and we had money for you girls in his will, but we talked it over after some years passed and decided to change things, leave everything to me. We never got around to taking care of it legally, but you should know he meant to leave the money to me.Okay? Okay?Karen? Okay?Okay. But now some of this furniture, some of this old shit you can just have. I don't want it, got no use for it. Maybe I should have an auction.Some things, though, like the silver, that's worth a pretty penny. But if you like I'll sell it to you, cheaper'n I might get in an auction.You might at that.Where are you living now, Bill? You want this old sideboard?You and Barbara are separated, right? Or you divorced already?Thought you could slip that one by me, didn't you?Nobody slips anything by me. I know what's what. Your father thought he's slipping one by me, right? No way. I'm sorry you two're having trouble, maybe you can work it out. Bev'n I separated a few times, course we didn't call it that. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 84.Truth is, you can't compete with a younger woman. One of those unfair things in life. Is there a younger woman involved?Y'see? Odds're against you there, babe.I didn't say they \"don't grow more attractive,\" I said they get ugly. And it's not really a matter of opinion, Karen dear. You've only just started to prove it yourself.The day calls for it, doesn't it? What form would you have me in?I'm just truth-telling. Some people get antagonized by the truth. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 85.You think you can shame me, Charlie? Blow it out your ass.Attack my family?! You ever been attacked in your sweet spoiled life?! Tell her `bout attacks, Mattie Fae, tell her what an attack looks like!Stop telling me to settle down, goddam it! I'm not a goddamn invalid! I don't need to be abided, do I?! Am I already passed over?!This woman came to my rescue when one of my dear mother's many gentlemen friends was attacking me, with a claw hammer! You think you been attacked?! What do you know about life on these Plains? What do you know about hard times?You DON'T know! You do NOT know! None of you know, `cept this woman right here and that man we buried today! \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 86.Sweet girl, sweet Barbara, my heart breaks for every time you ever felt pain. I wish I coulda shielded you from it. But if you think for a solitary second you can fathom the pain that man endured in his natural life, you got another think coming. * Do you know where your father lived from age four till about ten? Do you?Do you?!In a Pontiac Sedan. With his mother, his father, in a fucking car! Now what do you want to say about your rotten childhood? That's the crux of the biscuit: we lived too hard, then rose too high. We sacrificed everything and we did it all for you. Your father and I were the first in our families to finish high school and he wound up an award-winning poet. You girls, given a college education, taken for granted no doubt, and where'd you wind up? Whadda you do? Whadda you do? Who're you? Jesus, you worked as hard as us, you'd all be President. You never had real problems so you got to make all your problems yourselves.Just time we had some truth's told `round here. Damn fine day, tell the truth. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 87.It speaks.Scintillating.Poor Ivy. Poor thing.Poor baby.She always had a feeling for the underdog.Everyone's got this idea I'm mean all of a sudden.I told you, I'm just telling the --That is the truth! That's what I'm getting at! I, everybody listen... I am a drug addict. I am addicted to drugs, pills, specially downers.Y'see these little blue babies? These are my best fucking friends and they never let me down. Try to get `em away from me and I'll eat you alive.I'll eat you alive, girl!Goddamn you... goddamn you, Barb...You can't do this! This is my house! This is my house!No, honey, I'm fine. This house must have heard a lot of Weston girl secrets.Oh... nothing to be embarrassed about. Secret crushes, secret schemes. Province of teenage girls. I can't imagine anything more delicate, or bittersweet. Some part of you girls I always identified with... no matter how old you get, a woman's hard-pressed to throw off that part of herself. That smells good.Yes, please.I ever tell you the story of Raymond Qualls? Not much story to it. Boy I had a crush on when I was thirteen or so. Rough-looking boy, beat-up Levis, messy hair. Terrible underbite. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 100.But he had these beautiful cowboy boots, shiny chocolate leather. He was so proud of those boots, you could tell, way he'd strut around, all arms and elbows, puffed up and cocksure. I decided I needed to get a girly pair of those same boots and I convinced myself he'd ask me to go steady. He'd see me in those boots and say \"Now there's the gal for me.\"Found the boots in a window downtown and just went crazy: praying for those boots, rehearsing the conversation I'd have with Raymond when he saw me in my boots. Must've asked my momma a hundred times if I could get those boots. \"What do you want for Christmas, Vi?\" \"Momma, I'll give all of it up just for those boots.\" Bargaining, you know? She started dropping hints about a package under the tree she had wrapped up, about the size of a boot box, nice wrapping paper. \"Now, Vi, don't you cheat and look in there before Christmas morning.\" Little smile on her face. Christmas morning, I was up like a shot, boy, under the tree, tearing open that box. There was a pair of boots, all right... men's work boots, holes in the toes, chewed up laces, caked in mud and dog shit. Lord, my momma laughed for days.Oh, no. That's the end.No, huh-uh.My momma was a nasty-mean old lady. I suppose that's where I get it from.Thank you, sweetheart.Pull the car over.Pull the car over. I'm going to be sick.Please, honey --Barbara. The day, the funeral... the pills. I was spoiling for a fight and you gave it to me.Truce.How do you mean?I can't go through that again. No, I can do this. You got rid of my pills, right?I don't have that many hiding places.You wanna search me? \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 108.If the pills are gone, I'll be fine. Just need a few days to get my feet under me.I don't need help.I don't need your help.I don't need your help. I've gotten myself through some... I know how this goes: once all the talking's through, people go back to their own nonsense. I know that. So, don't worry about me. I'll manage. I get by.What's howdy about it?Ivy, you should smile. Like me.I'm not hungry.I'm not hungry.No.No.Go to hell.What's to talk about?I'm not hungry.NO!NO!Barbara...!No, you're not.Barbara, quiet now--Little Charles and you are brother and sister. I know that.I've always known that. I told you, no one slips anything by me.I knew the whole time Bev and Mattie Fae were carrying on. Charlie should have known too, if he wasn't smoking all that grass.Your father tore himself up over it, thirty some-odd years, but Beverly wouldn't have been Beverly if he didn't have plenty to brood about.Better you girls know now though, now you're older. Never know when someone might need a kidney.Hey, what do you care?Come on now --Who's the injured party here?We couldn't let Ivy run off with Little Charles. Just wouldn't be right.She'll be back. She's a sweet girl, Ivy, and I love her to death. But she isn't strong. Not like you. Or me.Oh sure. I never told them I knew. But your father knew. He knew I knew. But we never talked about it. I chose the higher ground. If I'd had the chance, there at the end, I would've told him, \"I hope this isn't about Little Charles, cause you know I know all about that.\" If I'd reached him at that motel, I would've said, \"You'd be better off if you quit sulking about this ancient history.\"I called over there on Monday after I got into that safety deposit box. But it was too late, he'd checked out.The note. He said I could call him over at the Country Squire Motel --And I did, I called him on Monday. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 133.We had an arrangement. You have to * understand, for people like your * father and me, who never had any * money, ever, as kids, people from our * generation, that money is important. *If I had my wits about me, I might've done it different. But I was, your father and me both, we were...You'd better understand this, you smug little ingrate. There's only one reason Beverly killed himself and that's you. Think there's any way he would've done what he did if you were still here? No, just him and me, here in this house, in the dark, left to ourselves, abandoned, wasted lifetimes devoted to your care and comfort. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 134.So stick that knife of judgment in me, go ahead, but make no mistake, his blood is just as much on your hands as it is on mine.He did this though, not us. Can you imagine anything more cruel, to make me responsible? Just to weaken me, make me prove my character? So I waited, to get my hands on that safety deposit box. But I would have waited anyway. You want to show who's stronger, Bev? Nobody's stronger than me, goddamn it. When nothing is left, when everything is gone and disappeared, I'll be here.Who's stronger now, you son-of-a- bitch?!...Barbara?Barbara?You and me. We're alike.Barbara, please.Please, Barbara....Barbara?Ivy?! Ivy, you here?!Barb?! Ivy?!Bev?! ...Bev?!Johnna?!Johnna... Johnna...

Remember the parakeets?I didn't tell you about the parakeets? She got a parakeet for some insane reason, and the little fucker croaked after two days. So she went to the pet store and raised hell and they gave her another parakeet. That one died after one day. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 21.So she went back and they gave her a third parakeet and that one died too. So the chick from the pet store came out here to see just what in the hell this serial parakeet killer was doing to bump off these birds.The heat. It was too hot. They were dying from the heat.These are tropical birds, all right? They live in the fucking tropics.What, is she smoking a cigar?No. No way....Mom?Hi, Uncle Charlie.It's okay, Mom. I'm here, I'm here. Shh, it's okay, I'm here.Did you see Bill and Jean?Ivy, I didn't see you up there.God, you look good. Doesn't she look good, Bill?Well... we can do that, Mom.Which room are you in?Mom, can Jean stay in the attic?Who's Johnna?She's the what? \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 26.He just left...?Why would he do that? Not like he couldn't drink at home. Unless you were riding his ass.Really.Oblivion.Wait, wait, wait, I'm missing something. Why do you care about a safety deposit box?Because...You're such a fucking cynic. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 29.Okay, what about the safety deposit box?And you only had Ivy call me today?Maybe he needed some time away from you.Good old unfathomable Dad.You don't want her here.They're called Native Americans now, Mom.It's what they like to be called. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 31.In fact, they are.Why's it so hard to call people --She may be an Indian, but she makes the best goddamn apple pie I ever ate.And now you get biscuits and gravy. Kind of nice, huh?Mom...I'm very dutiful, Mom, I call, I write, I send presents --Presents on birthdays, Mother's Day --Well, you're seeing her now.That is wildly unfair.I'd prefer to think my parents loved all their children equally.What was I supposed to do?! Colorado gave Bill twice the money he was making at TU --You think Daddy wouldn't have jumped at the chance Bill got?Daddy gave me his blessing.Now you're going to tell me the true story, some terrible shit Daddy said behind my back?Daddy never said anything like that to you. What a load of absolute horseshit. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 34.Are you high?I mean literally. You taking something?Listen to me: I will not go through this with you again.These fucking pills? Calls at three * AM about people in your backyard?The police, all the rest of it?So now it's okay to get hooked because you have a reason. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 35.I don't want to know if you are or not, I'm just saying I won't go --Because of your mouth.Are you in a lot of pain?I'm not yelling at you.I'm sorry... you're right. I'm sorry.Know where I think he is? I think he got some whiskey, a carton of cigarettes, and a couple of good spy novels... I think he got out on the boat, steered it to a nice spot, close to shore... and he's fishing, and reading, and drinking, maybe even writing a little. I think he'll walk right through that door any time. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 36.I'd forgotten about the lightning bugs.We have copies.It wasn't that big a deal.Those are small circles.Jean go to bed?Will you shut up about that fucking book?! You are just dripping with envy over these thirty poems my father wrote back in the late sixties, for God's sake. Y'hear yourself?My father didn't write anymore for a lot of reasons, but critical opinion was not one of them, hard as that may be for you to believe.I'm sure that's what you tell Sissy, too, so she can comfort you, reassure you, \"No, Billy, you haven't done anything.\"They're all symptoms of your male menopause, whether it's you struggling with the \"creative question,\" or screwing a girl who still wears a retainer.I know her stupid name -- do me the courtesy of recognizing when I'm demeaning you.Psychoanalyze me right now, I skin you.\"Your methods.\" Thank you, Doctor, but I actually don't need any help from my mother to feel rage.The subject is me! I am the subject, you narcissistic motherfucker! I am in pain! I need help!You can't do it, can you? You can't talk about me for two seconds --You do understand that it hurts, to go from sharing a bed with you for twenty-three years to sleeping by myself.Oh, men always say shit like that, as if the past and the future don't exist.It's just horseshit, to avoid talking about the things they're afraid to say.Like what?When did we visit this to begin with? I still don't know what happened. Do I bore you, intimidate you, disgust you? Is this just about the pleasures of young flesh, teenage pussy? I really need to know.You're right. I'll just hunker down for a cozy night's sleep upstairs. Next to my husband.Mom?Mom, wake up, the sheriff's here.Mom. The sheriff is here.What?I guess we'll stop on the way. Christ, I need to call Karen, too. Why the fuck am I brushing my hair?Right here, Mom...I used to go out with that boy. That man.In high school. He was my prom date.Day of the prom, his father got drunk and stole his car, stole his own son's car, went somewhere, Mexico. Deon showed up at the door. He'd been crying. Confessed he didn't have a way to take me to the prom. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 48.So we got a six-pack and broke into the chapel, stayed up all night talking and kissing. Now here he is, showing me -- It's so surreal. Thank God we can't tell the future. We'd never get out of bed.Listen to me: die after me, all right? I don't care what else you do, where you go, how you screw up your life, just... survive. Outlive me, please.Holy shit, that's Karen.Do you remember your Aunt Karen?-- uh-huh --No, I remember. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 51.And Scientology too, right, or something like that --?Like your father drowning himself.What's the kicker?Sorry. Hot flash.We said two words to each other -- \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 55.He seemed very nice, sweetheart ---- but what I think doesn't matter. I'm not marrying him --Yeah, we really need to talk about Mom, what to do about Mom --Yes. Yes.Okay. Yes. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 56.Give. Me. The wine.Is that what you were in such a hurry to get home for? What the hell's on TV that's so important you?For God's sake, you can get it at any Blockbuster.Let me make sure I've got this: when you threw a fit about going to the store with your dad... Hey, look at me. And you were so distraught over the start time of your Grandpa's funeral. Was this your concern? Getting back here in time to watch Phantom of the Fucking Opera?Phantom of the Opera --She's old enough to exhibit a little character. But that's something you normally learn from your parents.Really? Instilling character: our burden as parents.And you really haven't been much of a parent lately, so it's tough to --Nice, \"Gordian knot,\" but her fourteen- year-old self might view it differently, might consider it \"abandonment\" --Pretty fucking sophisticated, the restored whatever from Phantom of the Opera, I know that makes your dick hard --Precocious little shit.Be a father! Help me!Her father in name only!It's \"forsaken,\" big shot!Oh, \"forsook\" you and the horse you rode in on --I've seen where that gets me! I'm sick of the whole notion of the enduring female. GROW UP! Cause while you're going through your fifth puberty, the world is falling apart and your kid can't handle it! \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 68.This madhouse is my home.Jean is here with me because this is a family event.Y'know, you'd have a lot more credibility if you had any credibility.You're a pretty easy mark.Surely you must've known when you started porking Pippi Longstocking you were due for a little self- righteousness, just a smidge of indignation on my part --Is this your confession, then, when you finally unload all? \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 69.Mom?! Food's on the table!Mom?! Let's eat!Mom...!Yeah, sure.Uncle Charlie should say it. He's the patriarch around here now.Hm?This? Well... no. I mean, why?No, Mom, I... I wouldn't have any way to get that home to Colorado.I. I guess I'm just sort of... not prepared to talk about your stuff.Johnna cooked this whole meal by herself.That's pleasant. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 78.Yeah, I can't imagine why no one told that story.Jesus.What did you take? What pills?I catch her eating a cheeseburger every now and again.Double cheeseburger, bacon, extra fear.Mom... \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 82.Mom, we don't want to talk about this.Okay.Okay.Or you might never get around to the auction and then we can just have it for free after you die.What is the matter with you?Help us to benefit from an illustration of your storybook marriage.You've said enough on this topic, I think.Three days ago... I had to identify my father's corpse. Now I'm supposed to sit here and listen to you viciously attack each and every member of this family --I know you had a rotten childhood, Mom. Who didn't?No.Why are you screaming at us?You're a drug addict.Gimme those goddamn pills --Shut up! Okay. Pill raid. Johnna, help Ivy in the kitchen; Bill and Jean upstairs with me. You remember how to do this, right?Go through everything. Every closet, every drawer, every shoebox.Get Mom some black coffee, a wet towel and listen to her bullshit. Karen, call Dr. Burke.You don't get it, do you?I'M RUNNING THINGS NOW!You knew this was going on again?\"Greatest Generation,\" my ass. What * makes them so great? Because they * were poor and hated Nazis? Who doesn't fucking hate Nazis? Remember * when we checked her in the psych ward, that stunt she pulled?She smuggled Darvocet into the psych ward ...in her vagina. There's your Greatest Generation for you. She made this speech to us while she was clenching a bottle of pills in her cooch, for God's sake.The phrase \"Mom's pussy\" seems gauche.What word should I use to describe our mother's vagina?\"Mom's beaver\"? \"Mother's box\"?Is there something going on between you and Little Charles?Because you know he's our first cousin.Neither did I.Why not?You might have told us.That's different.Because divorce is an embarrassing public admission of defeat. Cancer's fucking cancer, you can't help that. We're your sisters.When did you get so cynical?Bitter, sure, but \"random selection of cells?\"Don't give me that. I participated --And if you didn't, that's not my fault.You're thinking of leaving?What are you going to do in New York?Like what?What about Mom?You feel comfortable leaving Mom here?You need something to eat? More * coffee?Please don't tell me that's the end of the story.Okay, well, that's the worst story I ever heard. That makes me wish for a heartwarming claw hammer story.Last time I spoke with my father, we talked about the state of the world, and he said, \"You know, this country was always pretty much a whorehouse, but at least it used to have some promise. Now it's just a shithole.\" I think maybe he was talking about something else, something more specific, personal... this house? This family? His marriage? Himself? There was something sad in his voice-- not sad, he always sounded sad -- hopeless. As if it had already happened. As if whatever was disappearing had already disappeared. And no one saw it go. This country, this experiment, America, this hubris: what a lament, if no one saw it go.What? No. But I'll understand if you want to quit. I mean, there's work. And then there's work.Why?Johnna, did my father say anything to you? \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 103.Thank you. That makes me feel better. Knowing that you can lie.-- right --Mild Cognitive Impairment?That would make you comfortable? You would be comfortable with that?You want us to send her to where, a psychiatric hospital?Right. Not \"gone\" so much as \"dead,\" but I see your point.So you're thinking that if the three of us cooperated with you on a commitment end-around, we'd be less likely to sue your ass?\"Mild Cognitive Impairment?\" Are you fucking kidding me? You really want to go before a judge and make a case for a couple radiation treatments and some chemo causing brain damage? Think you can make that stand up in court? When I'm sitting at the other table, doing this?Know whose name is on these bottles?We'll hang on to the bucket of these we have at home. For evidence. For your trial.We'll be home in a few minutes.Mom?Mom?! Where are you going?Goddamn it. Mom!Where the fuck are you going, Mom?There's nowhere to go.I'm sorry.No, it's important I say this. I lost my temper at dinner and went too far. *So... truce?What now?Don't you think you should at least consider a rehab center?All we could find.Mom, now, come on.Uh... no.I can't imagine what all this must be like for you right now. I just want you to know, you're not alone. If you need any help --I want to help.Mom.I didn't mean to eavesdrop. I froze.No, I quit years ago.Oh, this is...I'm not sure what to...Yes. It's true.This is going to be difficult, uh... Ivy and Little Charles have always marched to their own... and I'd expect this to be toughest on you --They're in love. Or they think they are. What's the difference, right?I know it's unorthodox for cousins to get together, at least these days ---- but believe it or not, it's not as uncommon as you might --Beg pardon?Go away.Go away! NOW! GO AWAY!You and Dad. Who knows this?Uncle Charlie doesn't suspect?What?!Did Dad know?Really. You people amaze me. What, were you drunk? Was this just some --If Ivy found out, it would destroy her.Jean, what are you doing up?Johnna, what's going on?I'll murder you, you prick!You know how old that girl is?She's fourteen years old!Son-of-a-bitch is a goddamn sociopath!What are you even doing up?Just tell me what he did!Yeah, I hate you too, you little freak!Where is he?Now wait just a goddamn --Karen--Right...Okay.Yeah, well... I can't make it up to Jean right now. She's just going to have to wait until I get back to Boulder.Why, what happens in forty years?Oh, right.No. Right. I fail. As a mother, as a daughter, as a wife. I fail.I've physically attacked Mom and Jean in the span of twenty-four hours. You stick around here and I'll cut off your penis.You're never coming back to me, are you, Bill?But no.Even if things don't work out with you and Marsha.Cindy. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 123.And I'm never really going to understand why, am I?Yeah...She's moderately clean. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 124.You don't like moderately? Then let's say tolerably.Back off.Oh Christ, Ivy, not today.That's not a good idea. For you and Charles to take this any further.Lot of fish in the sea. Surely you can rule out the one single man in the world you're related to.Fuck love, what a crock of shit. People can convince themselves they love a painted rock.Looks great. What is it? \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 125.Bottom feeders, my favorite. You're nearly fifty years old, Ivy, you can't go to New York, you'll break a hip. Eat your catfish.Don't get all Carson McCullers on me. Now wipe that tragic look off your face and eat some catfish.Howdy, Mom.Look, catfish for lunch. Johnna! You hungry?Mom needs her lunch, please.You haven't eaten anything today. You didn't eat anything yesterday.Eat.Eat it. Mom? Eat it.Eat it, you fucker. Eat that catfish.That doesn't cut any fucking ice with me. Now eat that fucking fish.No you don't.No you don't. Shut up. Shut the fuck up.Forget it. Eat that fucking fish.Eat it.EAT THE FISH, BITCH!Okay, fuck it, do what you want.Ivy's a lesbian.Yes, you are. Did you eat your fish?Eat your fish.Eat your fish.Eatyourfisheatyourfisheatyourfish--What the fuck --Are we breaking shit?`cause I can break shit --See, we can all break shit.You don't want to break shit with me, muthah-fuckah --Johnna?! Little spill in here!Little Charles --Little Charles --You have to say Little Charles or she won't know who you're talking about.Oh... Mom.Don't listen. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 130.It's the pills talking.Oh honey...Ivy, listen --When Mattie Fae told me, I didn't know what to do --I was trying to protect you --This is not my fault.I didn't tell you, Mom told you! It wasn't me, it was Mom!You knew about Daddy and Mattie Fae?...what motel?How did you know where he was?He left a note?After you got the money out of your * safety deposit box...Did the note say he was going to kill himself?Mom?You were both fucked-up...
