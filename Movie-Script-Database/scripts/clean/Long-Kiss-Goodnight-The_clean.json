{"Long-Kiss-Goodnight-The": {"SAMANTHA": {"raw_line": "How you holdin' up?*Put that away*.I can't take it, Earl, this dumb costume is giving me a wedgie. Driving me crazy, but there's these *kids* here --In front of little Billy, age four, yeah. \"Look, Mommy, Mrs. Claus chooses to go butt-mining.\"Age four, kid's unbelievable. I'm too old for this, Earl.Say that a little louder, there's a kid in back didn't catch it.Eight years. I keep hiring detectives, but they never find anything. I was born 3000 days ago on the beach in New Jersey. I entered the world fully grown, wearing clothes I don't remember buying. Nothing in the pockets but a single key, filed smooth. I'm married now. Nice guy, early forties. I stand naked in the mirror and try to guess my age. Thirty-five, maybe. I have lots of scars.Hal, I gotta tell you, of all the Christmas pageants I've seen, this was by far the most recent.Teenage boys?Just fine? Come on, it was ground breaking stuff. The first Nativity where Joseph stares at the wise men's tits all night.Hey, you!Her name is Caitlin. She's my daughter and when I woke up on that long-ago day, she was two months grown in my belly. I don't know who put her there. I may never. I just know she's mine, and she's about to turn eight.3000 days. I teach now, fifth grade. I have the key, I wear it around my neck for luck. Except for that, and my name, all traces of my prior life are lost. Was I in love ever...? Did someone look in my eyes, did I say, \"Darling, I'll never forget you...?\" Because fuck me, darling, I managed.Excuse me.Hello, girls. Caitlin, I'm going to help Dad with the refreshments. Which one's Dad? I forget.*Kidding*.That's funny, there's a cheap suit all over him like a cheap suit.This is all I ever wanted.Stick our fingers in out hands and pull them out again? Every chance we get. Shut your piehole.Earl, do me a favor. Every few words say \"hic\" and have bubbles come out your mouth, okay?I want a cigarette, why do I want a cigarette...?What... what do you want...?I don't smoke.I'm *remembering*, Hal. Things are coming back. Trust me, I'm a chef, I know it.Hush. Go to the garage and get me something, anything. A veggie, go, man, go! I'm hot to trot.More. Faster.Uh... chefs do that.They were on sale.*Allez, Gumby etiriait le cou, fils de pute*.I speak French.You bet your life, fluent French, whatever the fuck that means. Quand j'\u00e9tais a l'ecole, Jai eu un professeur qui s'est fabriqu\u00e9 du dentifrice!Right, he was, you got a problem with that? Pasty Joe, we called him. Look, the accent's perfect, so piss off. I'M A FRENCH CHEF, YA-HOO.Mr. Perkins, going in the basket.Just pretend they're still there. Piece of cake. You can do it.Shhh. Nothing to be scared of. Pretend you're one of the X-men, you're tough. Let's go, now. Three, two, one...Nonsense. You can do it. You don't want to, but you can.You can go home, Caitlin. You can ride there.Look, I know you're afraid, that's the whole *point*, can you see that? Now stop being a little baby and get on the damn bike.You gonna be afraid of things all your life? Huh? That what you want?Life is pain. Get used to it. See, you *will* ride this bike home, princess. You will ride it and you will not fall again, *is that understood*...?Yes, I'm three blocks past the gas station... Right. Thank you Mr. Henessey, I'll see you shortly.She said her wrist hurt. I didn't know it was broken, God. I can't even remember what I said to her...!A private detective's coming by, he... he's found something. I may have to go away. For a bit. Now please leave me alone.Are you deaf? I said leave me alone. Go to church. Drink blood. Drink some for me.GET OUUTTTTT!!!!NO!!!!It took me three seconds. That's... that's good, huh...?Caitlin. We gotta find Caitlin.That man who tried to hurt us...? If I stay here... other people will come. I have to leave. Just for a little while.I want you to light a candle and keep it in the kitchen window. And never, *ever* let it go out, because as long as it burns...? It means you're thinking of me. And if I'm alone... if it's dark and I'm lost... It's how I'll find my way home.That's for a portable phone. I keep it with me, you call me anytime, you don't worry about the bill. And last but not least --For luck.\"Movin' in.\"It's not linen. The song's not about linen.I'm freezing.I'll pass. So, you're a former cop. Atlanta, was it...? Stop me if I'm out of line, but I'm curious. How did you... well, succeed? I mean, where six other detectives failed?Yeah, this dirt used to be outside my window, shut up and let me look. I'm sorry, Mr. Henessey, I'm a little on edge.I can feel her. Like a ghost. We could walk away, you know. There's still time, we could just... leave her dead.Ay-i-yi!Size four, no way. You know how long it's been since I could wear a size four? Can't be mine. Can they...?What's in it?Hmm...? Uh, no. Just... more clothes.Hello, Mr. Windeman, I got this number from a realtor in Pennsylvania. I'd like to speak with you.You tell me, Mr. Windeman.My full name, please.*My full name*. Please...!Meet me off I-79. Highmile exit, Salt & Pepper Lounge. Eleven a.m.What's this? What the hell is this...? We don't have time for this, of all the cocksucking bullshit --What are you, a Mormon?Go up this hill.*Drive up the fucking hill*.HK M-40 assault rifle. At three hundred yards, vertical drop six inches.Shit. He's gonna do the girl.I read lips.See? Took care of it. Knew I could.Pull over.Had to, he... he would've killed her... Had to... Oh God I took him, such a good shot... I felt proud of it, such a shot, Jesus, *how could I be proud*...? I'm scared... I want to go home...I still can't believe it. You're saying my hands didn't even shake...?What's the matter with you?What... what are you telling me?I'll spell it out for you, ready? I have no future, *I can't go home*. Until I know what's happening, I'm in *prison*, you know how that feels...?I'm sorry. Um... what did you...?The bonds. Your partner put them there?No more killing.It was a helluva shot, wasn't it...\"Quarter til.

I think it belongs to a friend.Don't be afraid, we don't want to hurt you. I just want to know who you are.Yeah, well. I caught you and forgot you. Sorry.This is ridiculous. What do we do with this guy?It's possible.Caitlin.I don't know. It's coming back, though. All these... little details about him.I know he's got a pin in his leg, car accident. I know he cuts his own hair... thinks Rush Limbaugh's an ass. I know he sits down when he pees. I know --Mr. Windeman, please let him help you. I know this man, I... I'm pretty sure I slept with him.Not-so fresh.You... you're... the man from the bar...?I didn't tell a soul, I swear.Is... is this a torture thing...?Please, I'm getting all misty.

I gotta use the head.Pork. On your nine.So you shot a guy in the head yesterday. We wait outside.Too bad. People shouldn't shoot other people in the head. Just themselves.

She's moving us tonight, I'll sneak out to this phone, call you back at midnight with the details.All right, Charly. What did that accomplish?Oh, no.

I bet you were really attractive once.No.Did he make good?Your father was murdered.Okay, what's going on?You kidding me? I'm an ex-con, lady. I wear a shiny suit, my tie's crooked, and the last time I got blown candy bars cost a nickel. Plus I'm ugly, so what's up?Chemistry my ass. Know what I think? I think this is why you'd fuck me. To kill a schoolteacher. Bury any trace of her.Sorry, I liked the schoolteacher. When she comes back, give me a call.Oh, and call your fuckin' kid, will ya'?

Sink under the ocean, and when you come out you're a fucking schoolmarm, wanna tell me what happened?Mmmm. Personally...? I'm thinking maybe Samantha Caine wasn't an act. Maybe you forgot to hate yourself for eight years, ever think of that...?No, just some loser thought he could maybe understand, fuck it. I been there, you know. I'd kill for fucking amnesia. I'm with my boy and all I can think is I got reamed in the ass by three guys. Merry Christmas, son, here's a ball glove, did you know Daddy screamed when they carved the name in his back...?

I'd know if you did. I can tell if someone's lying. Sorry to bother you.Okay, people, I got what I needed. Wait until she comes out. Then do them both. Walk soft, we got local law.East, they're going east. *Head them off*.Look at her. She's not faking it, she doesn't know me from Adam.We're running on schedule, I just secured the tanker. We're borrowing it from Carbide in South Carolina. Cargo listed as fire retardant.You don't remember *at all*...?

Probably went shopping in his weapons storage too.We're still on, Perkins. I've got the tanker, the chemist, all ready to go... but you gotta contain her, man. We gotta step on her hard and fast.Wanna be a statistic, lady? You're about to have 2.4 children.I know where you live. Close your mouth, you look like a fish. Merry Christmas.It's me, I got your kid. Give your location, we gotta lose the cellular.Okay, here's how we do it. Drive to Harrison, find their main bus stop. Pay phone, fifteen minutes. Better drive fast, after five rings I hang up.I got your cellular number off a cast on her right wrist. Right below Mommy loves you... Picture of a panda.

Say the word, I'll hand her to you on a plate.The tanker's on its way from Charleston, ETA 1:00 a.m. One terrorist on ice, waiting to play patsy. What's in the sack?Fuck the cleaning, just drain it and reload. Chop-chop, I'm going bunjee jumping after this.Bogey.Take her alive, Perkins wants her!Good to have you back again, Chuck.Make sure you get all of them.Chuck, you give me the fuck of my life then try to stick me, come back from the dead, whack my boss... No sense lyin', I'm miffed.You wanna know the plan?Santa Claus -- small town U.S.A. personified. We drive the chemical tanker in tonight, park it. Add a catalyst, chain reaction, it goes hot. We evacuate. The mix heats overnight, goes critical at 312 degrees Celsius. 8:00 Christmas morning... Main Street looks like a meteor strike.Those roads are treacherous this time of year. When we dump a car to the bottom of a ravine, with the corpse of Imn Al Rahman in it... get the picture?Why? For old times' sake...?And why exactly should I do that...?Priceless. Can't believe it...Kid's down there. What it is, Charly, they're gonna find you both frozen to death in the woods. Suicide pact.The freezer's downstairs, Charly. Let's get it done.Shit, this place is loaded with fumes, nobody light a fucking match. You check her for flammables?Bears, yeah, yeah. Enough.Chuck, I'm not a total creep. I'll make you a deal, okay? There's a knife in that box. Now, you and the kid, you're going to freeze, *but* -- if you kill the kid *by your own hand*...? I won't kill your husband. Serious. We're gonna open that door and you'll both be frozen solid, but I wanna know that you've cut your own child's throat.Tell me where Charly keeps her money. She must have mentioned it.We'll be gone by then, Mitch.Already did, Mitch, someone already did. Perkins got stuck with a double agent, someone trusted, highly placed.Me. Chinks are paying me to bring down Chapter.Truck goes, hundreds dead -- rescue teams within minutes, guess what they find...?Uh-uh. They find Chapter, caught with their pants down. See, Mitch, I dumped in a much faster chemical catalyst... The tanker's gonna blow *tonight*. In the center of town, thirty-five minutes from now.Charly's stash. What's the number of the locker, Mitch...?Left nut, five bucks I make it.Move it out of here, now!I tried to give you a pretty death, baby. Did my best. Now you're fucked, now it's ground beef time.Sweet Loretta, you're another animal entirely. Let's see, 312 degrees... Make it ten minutes, give or take.Oh, spare me. You made a big noise and bought five more minutes on the planet. Give up. Die. I'll spit in what's left of your face.All units converge. Divert local law, this is a government matter. Brook no interference, I want the Baltimore woman eliminated. *Where's the fucking chopper*?Call it four minutes to detonation. I got a chopper on the way, lots of time.You'll feel me.You've lost a step, Chuck. Muscles never recovered from C-section, I'll bet. Am I right?She's a worthless bitch. I know it 'cause she came out of me.It's called shock, Charly... Your body wants to go into shock...Look at you. You're out of your motherfucking league, dearie.Fuck the shoulder, knee's worse. Just bring me around and hold her steady. I'm not leaving until I know the bitch is dead.Where are *you* going??*Somebody do her, somebody kill that fucking whore, kill her*!", "clean_line": "ll soon chance know town called santa claus tell know lying little skill trot parties timothy listening nix finishing going bunjee jumping right fucking important saw called nest fuck business tap phone yes tell daedalus way timothy long line bad investments saw ring finger know whoa total pickup line let forget said know tell lying sorry bother okay people got needed wait comes walk soft got local law east going east head look faking know adam running schedule secured tanker borrowing carbide south carolina cargo listed retardant remember greatest night life shit drown ungrateful wench okay ll signal daedalus money waiting jack favor dump cute try play doctor mistake poor black cousin seen boss dead rogue bitch took probably went shopping weapons storage perkins ve got tanker chemist ready gotta contain man gotta step hard fast wanna statistic lady children know live close mouth look like fish merry christmas got kid location gotta lose cellular okay drive harrison main bus stop pay phone minutes better drive fast rings hang got cellular number cast right wrist right mommy loves picture panda dog panda got funky ears want money charly know ve got numbered accounts ll let know fuck ll blind kid shoot knees ll touch hooked gotta set ransom meet way thinks acting remember word ll hand plate tanker way charleston eta terrorist ice waiting play patsy sack fuck cleaning drain reload chop chop going bunjee jumping bogey alive perkins wants good chuck sure chuck fuck life try stick come dead whack boss sense lyin miffed wanna know plan santa claus small town personified drive chemical tanker tonight park add catalyst chain reaction goes hot evacuate mix heats overnight goes critical degrees celsius christmas morning main street looks like meteor strike roads treacherous time year dump car ravine corpse imn al rahman picture old times sake exactly priceless believe kid charly gonna frozen death woods suicide pact freezer downstairs charly let shit place loaded fumes light fucking match check flammables bears yeah yeah chuck total creep ll deal okay knife box kid going freeze kill kid hand won kill husband gonna open door ll frozen solid wanna know ve cut child throat tell charly keeps money mentioned ll gone mitch mitch perkins got stuck double agent trusted highly placed chinks paying bring chapter truck goes hundreds dead rescue teams minutes guess uh uh chapter caught pants mitch dumped faster chemical catalyst tanker gonna blow tonight center town thirty minutes charly stash number locker mitch left nut bucks tried pretty death baby best fucked ground beef time sweet loretta animal entirely let degrees minutes oh spare big noise bought minutes planet die ll spit left face units converge divert local law government matter brook interference want baltimore woman eliminated fucking chopper minutes detonation got chopper way lots time ll feel ve lost step chuck muscles recovered section ll bet right worthless bitch know cause came called shock charly body wants shock look motherfucking league dearie fuck shoulder knee worse bring hold steady leaving know bitch dead going somebody somebody kill fucking whore kill"}, "CHARLY": {"raw_line": "Daedalus... Make you a deal... Let me go now...? I'll leave you the use of your legs... Bargain, trust me...I let you touch me, cowboy... I think I need a bath.Who's Samantha?You see in the movies, badguy says, \"Talk to me and I'll let you live.\" We're gonna run a variation, it goes like this: Talk to me...? I'll let you die.Where's Henessey...?It's cold, I want to come in.Can the bullshit, I'm not telling you where I am. I'll come in for a full debriefing, but we do it my way.Do tell.Fuck you, Perkins. If you want me dead, you'll pass a hat in the typing pool to buy bullets. We do things my way.From where I stand, it ain't much of a commute. You'll hear from me.Hey, Mitch. Glad you're awake. Uh- oh, you're seeping.Here, look at this.That's why I distracted you first. Same principle as breaking in virgins.Saw it in a Harold Robbins book. Guy bites her on the ear as he goes in. Distracts from the pain. You ever try that?Name's Charly. The spy. Nice to meet'cha. Drink?See? Sit next to the dance floor, every drink's free. People finish dancing, they think the waiter lifted 'em.Take two, they're small.Never really existed. Like Nathan said, she was a total fabrication, I made her up.Thank God. Look at my inordinately large ass, look what she did to me.Guess so.Change the subject. Better yet, steal me another drink.I called Chapter. I'm trying to bring us in from the field alive...Not sure. Until I know, you might wanna stay away from curbs.They like to push people in front of buses.If I could come that way I wouldn't need to dance the lambada. Follow me, I need you to do something.I'm testing our boy Perkins. I figure he's gotta be tapping your office. Got a light...?Come midnight, you hang by the phone. Nobody shows, we think about trusting him. He tries to kidnap and torture you, well, there it is.Oh, don't be such a baby. Ten o'clock, we got two hours to kill. I'm a woman, feed me.Ugh. God I'm full, I'm gonna have a food baby.Oh, I was. Check this out. One time? A guy said he'd fuck me.Swear to God.Absolutely. Oh, and afterwards? Oh my God, afterwards I said the most funny thing, you know what I said...? I said, \"Go back to your room. Dad...\"It's why he thought I had him killed.When Da died, I went to his funeral. 12 years old, today I wouldn't. And I overheard a woman, she was praying... She was thanking God -- sounded so happy -- thanking Him it hadn't been *her* father who was killed. See... she didn't really care that God had let someone die... just so long as it missed *her*. ...and she bought her cross at the same store as mine, see, that's what we do, we all pray to the same cross on a hundred different walls, and sit back and wait to see who gets hit and who gets missed.Fuck the waiting. Fuck being afraid. I determine who gets hit, and how hard. And I thank no one. It's pathetic to thank someone who spares you -- when they're just taking someone else. Walk me upstairs?This is my first date in eight years, Mitch. Is this a fun date...?True love, shut the fuck up.Chemistry. Be quiet.I didn't ask for the kid, Mitch. Samantha had the kid, not me, NOBODY ASKED ME.Easy, baby. She ain't coming back, no way. Bitch is dead.Fuck off.Forget it. I'm saving myself 'til I get raped.Oh, don't tell me. You're early, Goddammit, you're supposed to be at the pay phone. Go away and come back at midnight. I'm not ready yet. Got a light?What the hell are you doing here?You think I couldn't take him? *Idiot*, you probably scared the other guy away --Headhunters, nimrod, they go in pairs, were you always this stupid or did you take lessons?*What*?No, you don't.Fuck you. Just fuck all of you.Dammit. I knew I couldn't trust that prick.Easy, Spike. I got myself out of Beirut once, I think I can get us out of New Jersey.Good point.Get in.Yep. I gotta vanish, Mitch. I need money, a whole bunch.The key, Mitch. The one I keep around my neck.What if I told you it's the key to Box 406 at Pittsburgh International Airport?Not someone. Me. I filed them off. There's a briefcase in Box 406, Mitch.$200,000.Payment for my last assignment. I need you to retrieve it for me.Don't be stupid, they might have the place covered. I don't want to get shot to pieces.I'd love to. I left it with Caitlin back in Ohio.I fell into a school of fish, they elected me principal. Shut the fuck up.Shut. The. Fuck. Up. Hmmm... Nope, seems clear enough to me. Hate myself, Christ almighty. What are you, my shrink?Drive past, don't slow down. Park under those trees, honk if there's trouble.Good morning, Raymond.What did we learn about the dangers of smoking...? Give it here.Thanks. Tell anyone you saw me I'll blow your fucking head off.This is gross, this is gonna be so Goddamn gross...Phil...? Phil Krauss? I don't believe it, they moved you from cyphers. Long time, man, I figured you were dead by now.So, Mitch. Still think I'm warm and fuzzy?Exactly. What's in the glove box?Back off, man. Do I tell you how to snap photos of extramarital blowjobs? No.Hello?State Road 80, 15 minutes west of Harrison.He's got the kid. Doesn't want to talk on the airwaves, he's routing me to a land line. A pay phone.Excuse me?Verify you have her.You're dead, motherfucker. We don't involve families. It's not the way it's done, *we don't take families*.Give me an ANI trace. Do it.Another ten minutes. You want my Crazy Meal action figure?*I'll get the damn kid*, okay? God, I hope he doesn't shoot her up. Kid's dead weight if she's sedated.Oh, balls. Want me to cry on cue? I can. This is an extraction, nimrod, and she's the target, that's how to play it, the only way to beat this guy.Don't go there, Mitch, you don't want to know.Fine, you asked. I bumped pelvises with this guy. In Paris, back inI'd been assigned to kill his boss, remember...? Needed him out of the way. So I let him seduce me. Had a steel needle under the pillow, figured to stick him *en flagrante*, that means while we were screwing. But he was too slick. Bashed me in the head, finished, then threw me in the trunk of a car. Still think I'm a girl scout, Mitch...?It's almost dark. Let's get it done.They're here.Fucking Chapter, that's who. Timothy acting alone, Caitlin had a chance. Now...? She's dead meat.Negative. You stomp around like a forties drunk and you're a lousy shot.You couldn't hit a lake if you were standing on the bottom, now shut the fuck up.I saw a little girl.That's what happened under the water. That night, eight years ago.At the end... there she was, this pretty little girl at the bottom of the ocean, smiling at me. Three years old, didn't know Daddies hid in closets, not yet. Stared up at me in the strangest way... saying how'd it come to this, we were so pretty and perfect, now look at us, sinking with our head all open... Said when she grew up she was gonna teach school. She couldn't wait.Guards are on 27-1 megahertz, meet me at 26-9, you need to talk. As soon as you spot me with the kid, start blowing the charges.They're gonna blow my head off, you know. This is the last time I'll ever be pretty.Time now. What I do next, they tell me it... looks like a machine or something. You don't like it, don't look.Don't say it.Gotta go. If she's alive, she's coming out of there, Mitch. If she's not... they'll know we stopped by.No shit. Eight years ago, you send me to kill Daedalus and this clown. Now you're working *with* him.Budget cuts... oh, God. Is *that* what this is about...? The foot soldiers, the tanker truck... Fuck me, you're running a fundraiser!!You'll get all the money you want at the next budget hearing, won't you...? All you need is a major terrorist incident.Theory, my ass. I think some terrorists were planning a strike. Bought supplies from Daedalus, that's how you knew they were coming... No way. Don't tell me you're gonna sit there and let them go through with it, *just to get a budget increase*.That's not gonna happen this time...?So what's the plan? What's going out in the tanker?What's the plan? I'm gonna die, I wanna know.Easy, Mitch. How you gonna blame it on terrorists?Listen to me, Timothy. Please. Let my kid go.Goddamn you, *look at her eyes*...Because they're yours, motherfucker.That night in Paris, I got pregnant. The little girl's your daughter.She's no risk, Timothy, *let her go*.Be just a minute.Shhhhh. Mommy's here, it's okay. Safe and snug... what comes next, huh...? What's the next part?We're going to take a nap together, Cate. You can have your dolly, and Mommy will be next to you, how's that? It'll be like bears in winter. When they get cold, see, they fall deep, deep asleep...You're murdering us both, cocksucker, let the kid have her fucking dolly.It ain't over, motherfucker. You're gonna die screaming and I'm gonna watch. Am I telling the truth...?Shhh. Just for a little bit. Polar bear, remember?Open.Gimme a spark... show me, show me...Come on, come on... do it...!All this, just one fucking match, *Goddamit*...!I love you, Caitlin, oh God, do you know how much I love you...?No, baby, you're not gonna die. They are.When I tell you, scream as loud as you can, or else your ears'll get hurt.Hey, should we buy a dog...?*Run, Catey*.Where'd you go, baby... show Mommy...Smart girl, honey. Stay still. Don't make a sound. Snug as a bug in a rug...Mitch! I don't believe it. Listen, if you say, \"Are we having fun yet\" I'll rip your nuts off. Where are you?No, but she's safe for the moment, she stowed away on the tanker truck.Tires won't pop, Mitch. Bastard just locked her in, she's stuck in there and they're leaving, *Goddammit*!No chance. I make it twelve, Mitch, automatic weapons.*Your nine, on your nine*!*30 degrees left, Mitch. Left*. *Your other left*.*Nix, nix, I can't see in there, don't do it, break right...*!*Fuck me, I was wrong, get outta threre*!*De nada*.*End run, Mitch, go wide*!*No, Goddamn you, they got you flanked...*!The truck. How long til it blows?Then I better hurry.I'm the Missus. Drive.Sorry, man. Government agents, high level conspiracy.Veer left.Do it. In five seconds I'm gonna own that fucking truck.Hang on, Catey.*No, not fair, not fucking fair...*!Can't stop, Catey, can't...Suck my dick, every one of you bastards...Oh, honey. Only four inches...?Please, man... She's only... eight... she's a beautiful little girl...Fuck you, your breathing's lousy......You want a piece...? Take my shoulder.*Cover your ears*.Run... get out...The truck's a bomb... gonna blow up, RUN... I'm right behind you, go......*Go and don't look back*......mommy... here......You're grounded...I'm gonna get the gun, you run for that car. We go on three, okay? One... Two... *Three*.Somebody get that motherfucker off me! I got a kid here, I got my eight year-old daughter, *Jesus Christ*...! It's Christmas Eve, who are you *people*, fucking pull him off! Do you hear me...?Distract him, for God's sake give me ten seconds, please, I'm begging somebody, anybody, *she's my daughter*...!Suck on it.Die screaming, motherfucker.Hey... you're bleeding...Right, sorry......Are you... stupid...?I know.Good morning, I'm Charly. The slab you're standing on is actually a land mine. Keep your foot on the pressure plate, nothing happens. Step off the stone, we'll all be wearing you.My terms are these. Call State and order full disclosure on your personal correspondence. Then disband Chapter, effective immediately. In exchange...? I won't shoot you, and I won't make you stand on that mine. I won't touch you. I won't touch you. I promise.I promise.Yes, Mr. President, you have my assurance that Perkins' latest operation has been rendered beyond salvage.He's not in the greatest shape either.Out of the question.
