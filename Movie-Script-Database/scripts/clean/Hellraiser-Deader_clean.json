{"Hellraiser-Deader": {"AMY": {"raw_line": "Morning...Mmm...Eat me, Charles.I wasn't fired. I was re-assigned.I seem to recall a rather similar \"reassignment\" with you, Charles.Hey a contract's a contract.Look, if all this about me being late with the crack whore story It's all right here -- and it's gold. I was just about to-So what then? Are we being sued again?Thanks. What is this? General Tso's cat?What is it?What's the matter? This X-rated or something?Oh, sure. They're generally in their forties, kind of ex-hippy types. They still think Jerry Garcia is like \"really cool\" even though he's dead.You know, sometimes they wear ponytails. Dream about how great the sixties were. You see `em in the park sometimes...No, Charles. I've never heard of \"Deaders.\"Holy ... Charles...Have you called the police on this?I want to know if you've called the pol...Oh, man, don't tell me that was some special effect...This is sick...What the hell...Have you... have you found any of these...How could she...Who said they happen there?That all writers were queers?Maybe they're just getting started.What else do we have besides the tape?Why Charles...You know me too well.Always.Yes, I ah.....No. I'm looking for my sister. Marla Chen.She's my half sister. Same Mom. Different Dads. I haven't heard from her in two weeks so I got nervous.Does it always smell like this in here?Look. Marla is a friend of mine and she's missing.I need five minutes in there. Then I'll know what I need to know.She's dead...Dead! She hung herself in the bathroom. Call the police.Don't open it. Right.Yeah...You know I don't sleep when I'm working. What do you want, Charles?You know me, I dove right in. I was gonna' call you tomorrow.You know that's never a good thing Charles.That's what I get paid for.Like what?Okay, Charles. I'll make sure it won't be.Charles, I can't do the sensitive thing. I don't know how. I get the message. I knew the message before I got it. Okay, Mommy? You've had a change of heart? You want me to come home? Well I can't. Not until I know the truth. So there. You're off the hook. I gotta go.Charles, I get the message. OK? Your my editor, not my Mommy! Charles?Hello? Hello?Is Joey on this ride?Are you Joey?Amy Klein. Marla Chen sent me. I'm looking for a girl named Katya. Another young girl with red hair and half her head shaved. A guy with glasses named Winter.That's why I'm here. I need you to help me find them.I think they bring the dead back to life.Who are they? Where can I find Winter?Where is it?Joey...If you don't tell me, someone here will.I'm already into it.I'm not asking you to.Can't do that. I've got that fucked up self- destructive thing going on.Hey! You hit someone! Someone fell in front of the train! Hey! Hey!Somebody fell... somebody fell in front of the train.Back there, way back...And there's nothing there?Hmm?Um, I was standing on the platform......and, um... I saw this man standing on the edge of the platform, facing away from it.It's him.!It's them! Over there, over there!God damn it, get off of me! Get the hell off of me... Get...Least you got to travel. What were they going to charge me with, anyway?Yeah.Why'd you give me this story?It's real -- or I'm crazy.I've got leads. I'll know in the end.I don't see you complaining.That's for me...No.You know, Charles, there's something vaguely demonic about you.No, I didn't know that.Christ...Welcome to club anorexia...What the...What the ...Stop! Please stop! Stop this!You know me.That was a hell of a way in. Makes me think that you don't want...Yes. Was it real?Yes.What is it?Marla warned me about it, about you.So I shouldn't get on?What the hell does that mean?What happened to Marla Chen? What did you do to her?She didn't want to become one of you, whatever the hell you are. That's why she killed herself.That doesn't mean anything. What I saw in that room was real. What I smelled was real. Real like this table.Real like, like this hand...Nothing.I'm not afraid of you.No, get... get away...You're crazy.It's not real... it's not real...Hello.You just can't go too long without hearing my voice.Charles, you know I value your opinion-- but if there was ever a story I was born to write, this is it.This isn't like you.I'm just a little... fucked in the head. That's all. It's just a funk, but I'm fine. All I need is some sleep.Well, I wish somebody had told me about it.It's not real... it's not real.Wake up... wake up... wake up...I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming... I'M DREAMING!Hello, hello? Hello? Is there anyb...Came with the room. Along with the uncomfortable couch.Who are you? Why did you do this to me?Then why the hell are you here? Why are you in my room?What...It's a dream. I'm dreaming...I don't know what you're talking about.I'm not a believer.Starting to.I need... please... please help me.I don't understand. Why aren't I dead? Or am I? Please...Please, help me.Then explain what the hell is going on. Why did I have a knife buried in my back? Why am I seeing dead people walking around? Why is there a guy with Pins in his head stopping by in the middle of the night for a chat.Why am I not DEAD!The box.Joey?Joey come on. Let's get off the train. Right now, you and me.You and me...Why did you do this to me?Why?What's happening to me?Where?Then why are you here?No, I don't. I don't know one God damn thing anymore. I just want to go home.Marla what... what happened to you?Why are you doing this? Why am I here?But why? What it is all for?What the hell happened?The blood...I don't... I mean I didn't...Hey, Charles, Charles... this is the best news I've had in a long time.What about Marla Chen? The story?They found her. You mean the police?Where is she?No, I guess not.Trapped.Don't quit your day job.Don't drag me into your fantasies Charles. Please.Mind if I join you?I can see that, they're lovely.I'd like that very much.I'm sorry, you're right.How do you know my name?No... this isn't happening.Marla?Who?So it is real?I don't understand.Me.Leave her alone!I can't.I can't.I don't think so.I didn't want any of this. They used me to open the box. I didn't choose to do anything. Amy looks to Marla, she's got the fear of god in her. Pinhead sees Amy looking for help.Please.I didn't mean to.

Have a seat, angel of light.It's exactly that lack of respect for authority that got you fired from the New York Post.Of course. Where would you be without me? By the way, I don't recall ever being thanked properly for this \"re- assignment\". Charles makes air quotes with his fingers.Lucky for you I opened my doors to you here as soon as I heard you were \"available\".Touche'. Well, thanks to international conglomerates and the Euro-dollar I, along with Mother England, am blessed with your acquaintance, yet again.It's not about the crack whores, I'm sure you're working your usual unrestrained insightful magic on what I'm certain will be another eye-opening expose. I expect nothing but brilliance -- in five thousand words or less. But this is better.Hmm? Oh no. Please feel free to have some of that.Spare me the \"Nothing comes close to New York Chinese\" speech just this once. Go on, sit down. Just something I wanted to show you...Okay... rewind, rewind? Rewind.Somebody mailed us this thing around two weeks ago but, in keeping with our usual level of efficiency, Betty didn't get around to opening it `til this morning. Then she brought it to me.Something. Amy, with your encyclopedic world-wide knowledge of skank-ology -- have you ever heard of \"Deaders?\"Not dead-heads... Dead - ers. D-E-A-D-E-R -- S.Love of my life, go screw yourself. I'm asking you a serious question.Watch the tape.Just keep watching.Just watch...I said, \"Just watch.\"You tell me.That's saying a lot, for you.That's what I said.I haven't done anything. I told you, I just looked at it today. By some chance are you... interested in pursuing this?Look, Amy. Maybe this is just some kind of bull-shit shot-on-tape gore movie. And since that's all it can be, that's all you're going find, but it sure smells different to me. If it's bull-shit, you'll know pretty fast. If it's not...Who said miracles can only happen at Lourdes?No, that was a different time. This time, we were driving down the block and there was this fortune-telling place, you know, this gypsy fortune telling place in a store front? And he said, \"You know, if I could tell the future I wouldn't be living in any crappy store front.\"If I could do that, I wouldn't be hanging out in some rundown basement. I'd own the earth.Maybe.Just a return address on the envelope.Looks like your online fan-base is growing. It's an address in Bucharest. It's where all the Euro-trash kids looking for a good time are heading these days. Amsterdam is so 90's.I still like to keep my finger on the pulse, even though I know you think I don't have one.Your ticket, hotel and per diem.It's what keeps me up at night. Now here's the part where I'm supposed to say be careful. Be careful.Call me when you get settled.Don't tell me I woke you up. I won't believe that.You were supposed to call me.The thing is... I started thinking.Look. I know the crazy stuff you do for a story.And that's why I hired you. It's just. Just... the thing is, Amy... some things you shouldn't do, you know what I mean?Look, I say this to you, but in my heart I know that one time it's going to happen... that you're going to end up, I don't know -- dead or god knows what. But when it does happen, I don't want it to be my fault.You know, you're messing with my conscience, here. Amy...Is this where they keep the cheaper whores?Christ, you're lucky to have a boss like me. Once again, I have saved your small but relatively shapely behind.Charge you? They were thinking of shipping you to the government asylum for observation -- and believe me if you go in there, you don't come out. But through my mastery of international negotiations I managed to convince them that you were merely irresponsible. You got your stuff?Come on.Who else would have taken it? Either they're going to think it's bull-shit, or they're going to be too afraid of it. But Amy Klein... Tell me it's real Amy.Well, either way, it's a good story.You know, Amy dearest, for the average person, hunger for knowledge is like hunger... for food. We want to know just enough to take the edge off our appetite. Then we're satisfied, and we stop. But you... you're like a glutton. You can't help over-eating.But you see, that's the point. That's why I need you. Because all that stuff I don't eat... I still want. So I send you in to do the eating for me, and so I get to experience it, without actually suffering any mental indigestion.Nobody's forcing anything down your throat. Correct?You see, Amy, you never grew up with all this Catholic god and guilt stuff. It doesn't mean anything to you. I worry about god and heaven and hell. Not during the day, you understand, but around three in the morning, it keeps me up. I want to know what's coming. What's up in heaven and down in hell, or even if there's nothing. It's useful, when you're making plans. So go find out and we'll tell the world.Did you know, the word \"demon\" comes from the Greek word for \"knowledge.\" As in \"demonstrate.\"American education.Then back to your room, lie down in your coffin until the hours of daylight have passed, as is your wont -- then go get me my story. AI never do. I'm not here to save people and I'm not here to judge them. I just take `em as they come. And use them as they pass by. I'll be at the Soffitel.Amy it's Charles, I know it's not too late.Guilty. Look, Amy, I've been thinking about the story about what happened, maybe this isn't for you.- she said with condescension-I think it's too dangerous, for a lot of reasons.I know. I'm going to hate myself in the morning.OK. I just thought I'd put it out there to see if you'd bite. I should've known better. It goes against my instincts.Yes I believe I've heard that somewhere before.Good morning.Amy don't fight it, it's only going to make things worse.I didn't hear from you. I went over to your hotel. You were lying on the floor... covered in every kind of stuff that can come out of a human body...Okay. Every other kind.You were sort of... having a psychotic episode, sweets. Major mental blow-out. And frankly, it's about time. Jesus you were tied down for a day and half. Listen, I'm trying to get you out of here, back to London, but with the damage to your hotel room... They're not going to be so quick to let you go.Look, Amy, you probably won't have to stay...Well, there you go. A whole new definition of optimism.They found her dead in her room. She hung herself.Yeah. She'd been there awhile. Probably did it right after she sent us the tape.Jesus, I don't know. Does it matter?But this is a good story too. Call it, \"My Psychotic Episode\" -- or, wait, maybe \"Psychotic - Episode One.\" Or \"Psychotic Pilot Episode.\" You know, some play on words with episode. Look, there's a lot of raw material around here. Emphasis on the word \"raw.\" Maybe they'll let you use a felt-tip pen or something to take notes.What's say we lose the charm bracelets for now? Unless of course you somehow find all of this -- stimulating.I'll see about getting a camera in here...Feel better. When you get a chance, check out the public area. It's a swinging place. I mean, like, they're literally... swinging.See no Amy. Hear no Amy...I don't know, I just don't know. Too bad, too. It would have made a hell of a story.
