{"So-I-Married-an-Axe-Murderer": {"CHARLIE": {"raw_line": "Sherri! What are you doing?Oh, thank God... I thought you were robbing our own home, because frankly, that's insane. I mean, what could you possibly gain by robbing your own home? I don't mean to meddle, but isn't it better to rob other peoples' homes? Start accumulating their wealth as opposed to just reaccumulating your own wealth.What?! Just because we had a fight last night?I'm too young to get married. I'm only twenty-nine and a half. We love living together.See, Sherri, this is frustrating for me, okay. When we first started going out I thought we agreed that we weren't the sort of people who got married.Hey, I broke up with them for good reasons.Sandy was an alcoholic.She hated my family.She smelled like soup.She smelled exactly like Campbell's Beef Vegetable soup. She was dirty, physically dirty.Tony, Teenage Fan Club, they're Scottish you know?I had that dream again.No, but I have had that one. No, in this one I'm in love...And I say to myself, 'I've finally found somebody that I'm truly comfortable with.' You know when you're so comfortable that you'll let them put makeup on you to see what you would look like if you were a girl. Anyways you know what I do in the dream next?No. I die.Yes, but, I'm afraid, okay? There are seven main rites of passage in a man's life. Birth, first day of school, last day of school. Marriage. Kids. Retirement. Death. I'm at marriage. I'm two rites of passage away from death.Tony, you are a cop.Hi, Uncle Giuseppi.What did your uncle say?Ah, I'm sorry, man.Tony Spiletti, I don't think you could get more Italian than that. Unless of course your name was Tony Italian Guy.I'm so bummed. Sherri was great, wasn't she? I'm an asshole, aren't I?You've got to help me get through this night.Waitress, I'm sorry, there seems to be a mistake. I ordered the large cappuccino.Do you think these cups could be larger? They're practically bowls.I feel like I'm having Campbell's Cuppuccino.Look, Tony, I'm going home. See you later, girls.Perhaps you've confused me with someone who gives a shit. Here's what's gonna happen, Tony. We'll end up going out with them tonight, maybe even home with them. Well go out for two months. Soon she'll move in, we'll be happy, She'll want more of a commitment. I'll be terrified and I'll do something to ruin it. Just like I did with Sherri.I've come at a bad time.No, no, really... Obviously you've got things you have to do. You've got to dismember the rest of his bloody torso. Dig a makeshift shallow grave. Cover the body with quick lime. Really so much to do, so little time and I'm only in the way here, I'm just gonna go. Good luck.I bet it goes well with a nice Chianti. Fittfittfitt.Yes. Do you have haggis?Yes! I've never been able to find haggis anywhere, except at my parents' house. They're Scottish.Yes. I know it's a long shot, but you wouldn't by any chance happen to have any Prussian Venison?Mom, Dad, I'm here.Hey, William.Enough to recreate Devil's Tower in \"Close Encounters\".Aye, you do.Dad, what are you doing to Tony now? Why do you abuse his mind like this?I think you're suffering from the Stockholm Syndrome, where the hostages start to relate to their captors.And that's obviously why we haven't heard about it in the newspapers.Who are the other members of this pentaverate?Dad how can you hate \"the Colonel?\"Interesting... coo-cooA Juice Tiger?Thank you, no.Yeah, uh, Sherri and I broke up.I'm just not ready for marriage. I'm twenty-nine and my poems haven't even been published yet.That's not news, Dad. That's bullshit. I wouldn't wipe my ass with that paper.See you later, mom. See you later, Dad.It was a big hit.No. I think it's repellent in every way. In fact, I think most Scottish cuisine is based on a dare.Look, um, my dad's a butcher, do you need a hand?I'm meat literate.I'll check. You want blubber, right?I'm trying to be a vegetarian.Yeah, the problem is I really love hot-dogs.You could take me to a nice romantic dinner.This reminds me of my ex-girlfriend.Then let's not and say we did.You'd be surprised.Are you kidding me?Well, I've been in fights. Let me think.Tell me something bad you've done. And it better be bad. I mean, evil.Really evil. Like how many people have you brutally murdered?This just reminded her of that scene in \"Brian's Song\".You're very smart. It's a shame I'm going to have to destroy you.No, not at all.Well, I know everyone always say \"sense of humor\", but I'd have to go with breast size. How about you? In a guy.Me likey how you thinkey.Hey, you know what this apartment needs? A really large oversized poster of Atlantic City.You know Scotland has it's own martial arts. It's called FUCKU. It's mostly head butting and kicking people when they're on the ground.No. No. Not for me.Who for then what?Not me. No, Sir. Not here. Maybe it is late.Look, the truth is, yes, I had a great time, and I'd like to kiss you, but if we do kiss, then we'll kiss on the couch and if we kiss on the couch, then we'll kiss in the bedroom, and once you're in the bedroom -- Well, the thing is, I always rush it. And this time I feel like maybe I should wait. Maybe we should let it build naturally and grow, instead of just immediately spending the night together.I have no problem with that.Harriet...? Harriet...? You were having a dream, or...? You kept saying the name Ralph.Ralph. I heard you say it.Is she nice --? Ralph...You know... with this drought in California total strangers are urged to shower together.Oh God. I'm sorry. Jesus. Excuse me.Hi. I'm really sorry. I must have scared the... I'm Harriet's friend, Charlie, and you must be... Ralph?That's a very nice note.Gee, I'd love to but I'm running late.Hey, that stuff'll kill you while Fruit Loops are light and probably reasonably high in Fiber. I like Apple Jacks too.So this is your apartment?She told me about a martial arts guy and there was some discussion about Ralph...She spoke of the martial arts guy and screamed about Ralph...Actually, I really don't.Hello.My, look at the time.I am... usually. I just... You should know, this is very unusual that I would do this so soon, in this day and age particularly, but... We just really hit it off. We did. And...But... nothing did happen.No, we don't. You do, like I said, I just met her.Good. Good. Look, Fred... You got a lot of girlfriends, right? You know any girls named Ralph?Well, not necessarily, but... Never mind. Thanks, Fred.Hey Penny, I wanted to ask you -- you know some girls named Ralph, right? I mean, that's a girl's name also, isn't it?Forget it. Thanks.Sssh... Stop it. I'm trying to listen.Sssh I don't want to talk about it.Tony, get your mind out of the gutter. All you need to know is that she's a sweet, kind and loving person.Look, what can I tell you. I'm smitten. I'm in deep smit. I dunno. I just don't wanna talk about it, because then I start analyzing and that's not good for me.Exactly. That's what's gonna be different this time. Something strange happens, let it go. It's not my business... Like Ralph. She says Ralph in her sleep.I don't know who Ralph is. Moreover, I don't want to know.Exactly. Tony, I'm happy. Don't let me screw this one up.Hey, uh... Ralph...?Shit.You look great.Honestly? I'd leave it off.Let's forget the poetry concert. It's already been nine hours since I last made love to you.Fifteen minutes. Perfect.Maybe later.Aaaahhh!About Harriet?I don't wanna know. I mean, look everyone has some skeletons in their past. I only care about the future. Not the past.Tell her what?We're not lovers.No, not at all. We were just talking about... Rose and I met yesterday, so...Good grades are good.It's beautiful...What is it?What do you call it?A lot artists don't like to title their work. They feel it biases the viewer.Rose, great to see you. We should all go out together some time. The three of us. That would be great. That would be... interesting.I think you're going to love Alan Ginsberg. He's great.This is Harriet.Thank you, Tony. This is my best friend.Yes, I do.You do it.No, no, you're okay, you're just having control problems.I know this is really, really cheesy, but in a way this is one of the places in San Francisco I'm most proud of.Well, this is it.Mom, Dad, we're here.Dad, what's Al Pacino doing on the Scottish wall of fame?Dad, no one wants to talk shop. Especially butcher shop.Ah! Dad, dad I have a back zit, man it kills.Oh Mom, don't start with the pictures.I'm gonna use the bathroom. You be okay alone with them?Ma, just show her the pictures.Jesus...So, that was some move you put on my Dad, there. Did you study Karate, or...?Oh, the martial arts expert. The north-south guy. Here in San Francisco?Was that before Atlantic City, or after?Is Tony back there?Hey, Tony, I gotta talk to you.Nice guy. Hey, what's up?Let me get this straight, your Captain hasn't threatened to have you up on charges so fast you won't know what hit you?Have you heard of this case? Mrs. X? She murders her husbands on their honeymoons and then changes her identity and marries again.Curious, that's all. I read about it, and... I think I'm dating Mrs. X.Everything's adding up, Tony. One of the victims was a martial arts expert. Last night at dinner, she put a martial arts move on my dad.If they also say Ralph in their sleep I think it'd be a good start. Ralph Elliot. A plumber from San Francisco. Missing since his honeymoon.Hey, don't analyze my dreams, okay? They're my dreams. Analyze your own dreams. It's not a marrying thing, Tony. It's a murdering thing. Harriet lived in Atlantic City, right? Well so did this guy, right around the same time she left town.I don't know. It hasn't come up yet.What? It's the fifth highest circulating newspaper in the United States. Mrs. X. Please. Look it up.And Ralph Elliot, too?Yeah well murder is. And this article says that these men were murdered by the same woman.It guess so. It's just... if I had a photo of Harriet, I could show it to the relatives or friends of Mrs. X's victims to identify her.Maybe I could wait.Inside? I was hoping...I couldn't agree with you more.Look, if you have work to do, you go right ahead. I mean, to tell you the truth, I'd love to see your work.No, I don't want to see you work. I was talking about your work. Your photographs. That one that I saw was so, wonderful, and...Well, I'm sure it's so subjective anyway and... Rose, show me your photos.Hey, these are some interesting photos here. Very impressive. Nice shots of Sauselito and... some good bondage shots. A lot of people wouldn't think to mix the two subjects, but they're really a natural together. Hey, you wouldn't happen to have any pictures of Harriet by chance, would you?No, no, not that. Just, in general some photos. Any little snapshot would do.Oh, nothing. Just looking through some of Rose's work.And that. That too.Well, sentimental reasons. Something to remind me of you when we're not together.Okay, it's just, I was gonna give one to my parents, too, and... Another time would be fine. It's hardly a matter of life and death.Where you been?Great. I just wanna do a quick twenty minutes on the Stair Master before bed.I'll do forty tomorrow.What is it?Oh, look, I'm full. Dinner and... No...No, really, thanks.Ummm. Smells good. Maybe I'll take some to the office tomorrow. I'm gonna brush my teeth. Be right back.Harriet, where did the shake go?Harriet, why don't we shut the light off.Maybe we should turn the light back on. Yeah that's better.Nothing.Well, it's just... The TV. You can't even watch the news these days without getting depressed.What do you mean?Well, I don't really take the subway ever, so...Why do you say that?What could you do?Aahhh!Good night.Well... good night.Your children?That's a lot of cats.Do you have a name for all of your cats?...He was Scottish.Actually he was Scottish. Trust me, I know these things.Noooooo!Nooooooo, Scotch is a drink. Scots are a people. Sorry, that just always bugged me.Hi, Harriet.I'd like to put in an announcement of my parents forty-fifth wedding anniversary.Bold, and here, I've written it out.Did they mention anything about his wife?No, I'm serious. Did he mention the wife?I really want to know about his wife.Is there any mention of the wife? At all?I'm sorry. I think you're a terrific woman. I just don't think we should see each other anymore.The truth. Okay. The truth is...The truth is... I'm afraid that you are... You're going to laugh.Okay... the truth is that I'm afraid you're going to ki... leave me.Leave me. Not \"cleave me.\" Reject me. And so I decided to take matters into my own hands and get it over with by...Purely preventive... It's not anything you've done.Harriet, maybe I'm not meant to be in a relationship.I never wanted to hurt you.Two hours and four minutes. Tony, I need you, and two hours and four minutes later you show up.I'm gonna tell you, but when I do, just say nothing. Don't judge me. Just be my friend. Okay?I broke up with Harriet.What's your point?Tony, she's a killer. The... everything.I dunno, Tony, I just...Hi. How're you doing. Good, huh?That good looking and he can read!We broke up. There were problems.Difficulties.Why did you just say that?Hello...Really? Did she confess to the other murders?Really. Leaky sink, huh?Harriet, it's me, Charlie.I've gotta talk to you, cause I miss you, and I made a mistake... and if you give me another chance I'll change. I will. I promise. I'll get help, or therapy, or... Yeah, that'll be great. Therapy. Even twice a week. I'll check with my insurance to see if I'm covered, but forget that. Harriet...I'll make it up to you, can we at least talk.AAAhhhhhh.I don't want to lose you.I'm unrejecting you.I love you.You were close as kids?Really?Where are they now? Your parents?Ralph?Oh, like Ralph, the lady carpenter in Green Acres!I love you!Nice? It's more than nice. It's great to meet you. It's fantastic to meet you. I just, I can't tell you how glad I am. Ralph. Really. I am.Oh, Ralphie, I love you.I'm naked, aren't I?I should really get dressed now.Call me.Hey Dad, I got an anniversary present for you...Harriet, I wanna talk to you.I'm just so happy for you to have friends like Ralph. What a great friend to have.Harriet... marry me.I want to have a wedding. With you.Please.Because, I love you and I want you to marry me and be with me for 45 years. I want you to have my children, and I want to have your children. I know that sounds like a lot of children, and they might not all get along, but... I'm finally ready to trust you and to make a commitment. Marry me, Harriet, please. Be my wife.You will?Nothing. Nothing at all. Just two little things... That woman over there in the corner... She's Harriet's friend, and her name is Ralph.And secondly... That woman over there... That's Harriet, and we're getting married.I do...Auntie Molly if I have another one I'll end up underneath the table with my kilt over my head.I don't know. Oh, there she is.A little hungry, were you?Wait 'til you see this place, Harriet.This is Teenage Fan Club. They're from Scotland.We'll have the whole lodge to ourselves practically.I wish you could be me, so you could know how great it feels to be with you.Do you think that would be a good line for a poem?Yeah, it's a little Seals and Croft. I have a habit of sabotaging relationships, and there were a million times during me and you that I could have blown this, and I just thank God that I didn't...Lamb chops, creamed spinach, stuffed tomatoes and a Hershey Bar.If they don't have all that, I'll just take the Hershey bar.What do you keep looking behind us for? Is someone following you, or...?What do you mean, they were?The gas station guy? Why would the gas station guy chase us.What do you mean not paying? You didn't pay him for the gas.So, you just left.I'm not sure I understand.I can play that game. I'll get the next gas station. Like Bonnie & Clyde.Great. If you could help us with the luggage, we have these two in the back seat and...Harriet? What are you doing honey?Great. Sounds terrific.Did you hear that, Harriet? A storm. I can't think of anything more romantic than the two of us trapped in our room in the middle of a rain storm. You okay, Harriet?What?This is the best honeymoon I could ever imagine, Harriet. If we had to pack and go home right now, I'd still think it was the greatest honeymoon ever.Don't you agree, Harriet? Harriet?What? What are you crying? What is it?So do I. Look, there's nothing more I'd like to do than have, kids, or...What are you talking about? You're gonna be a great Mom. I know you will.What then?Tell me. Of course I'm not gonna laugh. Kids is a big thing. It's hard. I'm sure I have the same fears.Webbed feet?No, I'm not laughing.No, no. That's a natural fear. I've thought about that fear.Well, look, they have, doctors -- I assume -- that deal, only with, webbed feet. And, God Forbid, and I'm talking strictly hypothetically, should that happen, we'll find one.Thanks. We should get ready for dinner.You almost ready? The first seating is in five minutes.I'm sure you look great. I'm sure you look...Yes. Well...Nothing. You kind of look like Tammy Faye Baker right now.Hello?Great. Couldn't be better.Look, that's great -- it just so happens though, that I met... Ralph, and much to my delight, not only is she alive, but she's female. I thought I told you.So, what do I do?Hello? Hello?The phone just went dead. I was on the phone and it went dead.Nothing... Nothing happened. Just the lines are down. Phone lines.Of course. Sure...I need your help! You have to help me! I've married a...!My dinner. I didn't finish my dinner yet.Come on in. Stay for a nightcap.Stay for a nightcap!STAY FOR A NIGHTCAP!STAY FOR A NIGHTCAP!Harriet, I...I already know.Yes. And I was meaning to have a word with you. We could get an annulment.Aaaaah, Rose, I never thought I'd be so glad to see you.Maybe the phones are working again by now.'Dear, Harriet. I just can't handle the commitment. I'm leaving you.' Signed, 'Charlie.'What the hell is this? I didn't write this?What the fuck?!Nothing, Rose.Call the police!Call the police!What's that, Rose?Thank God. I'm sorry I doubted you, but I thought you were the killer, but you were acting pretty strange?My dad was right. You don't lose your muse once you're married.

a normal suburban guy at heart, from a normal suburban family. Didn't you tell me you always wanted to get married and have a family.I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.Christ. It's the cops.I know. Isn't it awful? I work with those guys. They're assholes.Salve zio mio.He says my Dad's back in jail again.You know, it's funny I don't even feel related to my parents anymore. I feel like your mom and dad are more like my parents. I feel more Scottish than Italian.Yes.You've just got to get back on the horse.Join us in a cup of coffee? There's enough room?My name's Tony. This is my friend Charlie.You really don't understand, do you? When a girl comes over to your table and says, 'I think you're funny.' It means you've pretty much been given the keys to the city. Charlie, this is big.I just broke up with somebody as well. She left me high and dry.Aye -- magic.You know a lot of this makes sense.Ah, beautiful goal. We HOLD on the TV set.See you later, Mrs. MacKenzie.You know I've lived in this city all my life and I've never been to Alcatraz.You're glowing, Charlie. The man's in love.So did you and Harriet?... you know...With that look, you don't have to talk about it. The grin alone could get you five to seven years.Good. I think that's good. Just let it happen.Who's Ralph?Good.Hey Charlie!Sorry we're late.You must be Harriet. I've heard a lot about you.Oh. Sorry. Of course. I apologize. Charlie described you as much older. And heavier.And this is Susan. Charlie, you remember her from Uncle Giuseppi's.I give Susan one night.Come on, you'll be great...Yes, Captain.Captain. It's about my work. About being a policeman.I know. And that's what's irritating, you're too nice.Yes, You're my captain for gods sakes. You should be constantly on my case, like the captain on Starsky and Hutch. Once a week you should routinely haul my ass into your office, accuse me of being a maverick and complain to me that you're sick and tired of defending my screwball antics to the commissioner.Police work should be all about running around, following up crazy hunches that turn out to be right, going out on a limb.Captain! When I joined the police force, I thought I was going to be Serpico and unfortunately I ended up being Toma. I would have settled for Beretta.I'm having doubts about being a cop again. It's not like how it is on cop shows. All I do is fill out papers and reports.No! He's never once said to me that he was going to \"throw the book at me so hard it'll knock my ass from here till Tuesday.\" Anyways what's up?I never heard of it. So what?Two words, Charlie. Get therapy. They have doctors that deal specifically with this illness.There about twenty thousand people in San Francisco who are martial arts experts. Should I arrest all of them too?You're just getting scared. Like the dream, you feel Harriet could be the one, so you start to suspect her of things, 'cause deep down you're scared that if she is the one, you'll marry, and marriage to you is death.\"Larry Leonard, a crooner who made a name for himself for being able to sing in six different languages the song \"Only You\". Does she know the song \"Only You?\"Charlie, move past it. You're running your life by the National Enquirer.Charlie, you're talking about three guys over a seven year span. That's hardly news. No deaths. Elopement in this state, as of this day, is still not illegal.It's true, Charlie. You gotta realize that. I mean, personally, I would lie to you, but Kathy... has this crazy notion of always telling the truth. You feel better now?Charlie, listen to me! There is no Mrs. X! Drop it! Okay?Sorry. I know it was irresponsible to stay at the drug bust until it was over, but... What happened?Fine. Okay.You're an asshole.I'm sorry, I just... why?But nothing's proven. The only thing you're actually sure she did so far is she's treated you like a King.Besides, everyone has something going on with them. I mean, you can't find everything in one person. I mean, she's bright, she's funny, she's independent. So maybe, and it's really just a maybe, she kills her husbands. Marriage is give and take, Man. You take the good with the bad.Not that it matters anymore, but I thought you should know -- someone just turned themselves in for the murder of Ralph Elliot.Just the plumber so far, but she'll come along. A little old lady from Pacific Heights. Said he overcharged her on a leaking sink.Anyway, crime to stop. Gotta go. I'll catch you later.Hey, sorry I'm so late. What's happening?No shit.Fantastic... What did I tell you. She's a great girl. And the last thing in the world she'd be is a murderer.Where's Harriet?Yes, Captain.Captain, I got this friend...Captain, I know what I'm doing. Trust me. What's the news.I knew she would! I knew it!Oh, my god! I gotta go!I won't let you down, Captain.That's much better Captain.What is it with the women in your family?Hey, this is real blood.I need a picture of Harriet.You took a picture at the party. I saw it.Look, Rose. I need a photo.She's been implicated in a crime. I need the photo to eliminate her as a suspect.If she's \"quirky\" we'll save Charlie's life.Circuits are out from the storm.Keep trying the hotel. Tell the chief I just chartered a plane up to Oregon.Not now, Captain.Great. Rockies. I don't care. Oregon. Move.Just land. Don't worry about Lake Shanony. I don't give a shit about Lake Shanony.Charlie, you okay?Charlie, listen to me! It's her! Harriet is Mrs. X! She killed Ralph and the two other men!Rose had a picture. It checked out. It's her, Charlie. She is the murderer.I called the police. All the roads are closed, but they're on their way. In the mean time just...You have to rent me something. I've gotta get up there. My friend's in danger...Excuse me, Sir, I'm with the San Francisco Police Department. I'm on official business and I'm afraid I have to commandeer your vehicle.What do you mean no?!This is true. Please can I commandeer your vehicle?To The Dry Creek Lodge.Well, I don't want a lift, I really want to commandeer the vehicle. Please just let me commandeer the vehicle.You're not going to bend on the commandeering thing are you?Well, if we get stopped will you at least let me say that I commandeered the vehicle, but I let you drive?Please?Charlie!Get on the floor and put your hands behind your back.Nice try.No you don't.Oh no, not again.

It's over here in our Scottish Cuts section. One?That'll be fifteen, seventy-nine. Will there be anything else?Now where in the world would I get Prussian Venison?Oh, hi haggis, right?I remember you told me you were Scottish, but do you really like haggis.Can I help you? Sorry, I'm really busy.Well, actually, Yes.Can you get me four Belgian porterhouses? Do you know what a porterhouse looks like?Look, I'm really grateful. Can I offer you some meat as payment? Please, help yourself to some meat.Trying to be a vegetarian?I think the meat industry invented hot-dogs to stop people from becoming vegetarians. There's got to be something I can do to repay you.I hate talking about old relationships.That was easy -- What a nice guy. You've probably never done a mean thing in your life.I'd like to hear. Name me something bad you've done in your life.No. Did you ever steal anything? You ever hit someone?Not one bad thing, Charlie?How evil?\"Brutal\" is such a subjective word. I mean, what's brutal to one person might be totally reasonable to another.Actually, he just proposed to her. Those are tears of joy.Prost.Do bright women intimidate you?Really, what do you look for in women you date?Income of course, and then... ...savings.I'll make us some tea.I used to live there. That's where I had my first supermarket job.I only have chamomile. I hope that's all right.It's North-South. For health reasons. See... I had this friend, he was a martial arts expert. Anyways, he used to sleep North-South. I don't know... It's a martial arts thing and it just sort of became a habit with me.Late?Who for then?Well, you looked at your watch and said it wasn't late for you... I wondered who it was late for.I want to spend the night together.Yes! Yes!Yes Ralph. I will. Ralph.Now now Ralph!Ralph?That's odd. Just today I was thinking about, her. She's a friend.Yeah. She's great.Rose, I don't really --Yeah, he stayed over?That's good.He did? Yeah.Rose he's a sweet, kind and loving person. We like each other, but I don't want to think any further. It's taken me a long time to get back to dating, and I want to take things real steady this time.He was quite happy not to talk about the past.That's good.The eyes are good.It's a good likeness.Rose, I don't wanna screw this one up.Charlie, they're beautiful. I'll put them right in water.I was just getting dressed. What do you think of this skirt?So then you think I could go to a poetry concert like this?Come on we're meeting your best friend. I wanna look good. The second I go to the ladies room he's gonna tell you what he really thinks of me.Come on, Charlie. We have to be there in fifteen minutes.I hope I'm not interrupting.So I heard.So, don't you think we look alike?She's just being kind. Show Charlie one of your photographs, Rose. Rose is a great artist.You're so modest. If I weren't here to brag for you, I just don't know... Show it to him, Rose. Do it.We should get going, Charlie. Thanks, Rose... See you later.Oh, I know all about him.Oh, he did...?No, Charlie. I'm the worst.Sorry... I told you Charlie.Yeah, let's go in.I feel so safe with you right now. You're never going to leave me, are you? I feel like I could be here forever.Ralph! No, Ralph!It'll be fine.Thank you.I'm sorry. I just... You just surprised me. I'm sorry.I'm really embarrassed.Fine. Don't worry about it. Hurry.What a nice family you have.Charlie was the cutest baby.I can't believe the resemblance between you and Charlie, Mrs. MacKenzie.You have the same smile. It's so incredible.No. Not officially. I dated a guy for a while who ran a studio.Actually, Miami.Oh, that was years ago. Atlantic City was recent. I didn't care for Atlantic City. A town full of gamblers and lounge singers.Rose -- did I see Charlie's car out in front?What are you guys doing?Why of me, Charlie?There, can you remember that?Downstairs. I have a surprise for you.I got something much healthier for you than that.It's a health shake. Eggs, malt, cinnamon, oranges. It's great. I mixed it up downstairs.You'll like it Charlie.You won't try it. I spent twenty minutes making it.I'm gonna take a quick shower.What do you care? I drank it. You could have at least tried it. You make me feel bad sometimes, Charlie. I don't know why.Sorry. I'm a little sensitive. You didn't want to drink my milkshake. So what -- right?Charlie, what's the matter?Charlie...I know, Charlie. And it's not just that. Look at the things people are doing. Partners killing each other... I mean, you hear a story like that, and... who can you really trust these days?It's like, have you ever stood with someone at the edge of a cliff, or the edge of a subway platform, and you think, just for a split second, \"What if I pushed him?\"I'm just making a point of how many times we trust people with our lives. I mean, look at us. If you didn't trust me, you would never be able to fall asleep.Look at you, you're sleeping. Look how vulnerable you are. I mean, I could do anything at that point.Anything. You're lying on your side, asleep, I could... stick a needle in your ear.I'm just making a point of what a good relationship we have. Goodnight, sweetheart.Well, good night.Good night.Charlie.Hi.Why not? And tell me the truth.I don't think so.I'm going to \"cleave you?\" What does that mean?Rejecting me.I know that... So why are you leaving me?You haven't. At least you left early on. So, that's it, then. I've got a lot of work to do. Now, where were we?Go away, Charlie.You really hurt me.Sure, talk.You didn't lose me. You rejected me.How do I know you won't reject me again?I love you. But you blew it, Charlie, you blew it.I thought it was coming from here.I've been there for almost a year. I only planned on stay with her for a few weeks, but she gets upset every time I say I'm moving.I pretty much raised her. You know the scene. Depressed mother... withdrawn father. My dad was a photographer too.He hated it. Trudging off to those weddings every Saturday night. Other people's celebrations he called it. He said sometimes they didn't even offer him a glass of soda. He had a small studio, and every year at Christmas he'd take a picture of me and Rose and put it in the window on a little card that said \"Seasons Greetings.\" Awful pictures. It's like... I could see his pain in my face. Anyway, me and my sister worked with our \"childhood issues\" in different ways. She became a photographer and I became phobic about having my picture taken. It's quite a family.Dead. Car accident.Charlie, I want you to meet a friend of mine. Say hi to Ralph.This is Charlie.I'll leave you guys alone. Have a great time.Why, yes, you are.Boy, you really made some impression with Ralph. She can't get over you.Is everything all right, Charlie? You're perspiring.What?No.I don't know, Charlie. It's so good like it is. Why don't we just live together first?Yes.Let's get married, Charlie.I do.What are you...!Sorry. The flash just...They're great.I can't wait, Charlie.It sounds wonderfulHonestly? It sounds a little Hallmark.You want anything?They were. I think they're gone.The gas station guy. I thought he was chasing us for a while, but I guess he stopped.I don't know, Charlie. I guess for not paying.I forgot to pay... I didn't want to be away from you for any longer.Yes. And you're an accomplice.Look, Charlie, don't you get it? We're a team.It's like a castle, Charlie. It's so beautiful.Just a little head-ache. Excuse me, is there a drug store in the hotel? I want to get some aspirin.Thanks. Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.It's nothing. It's just... I was just thinking... We're married now. And I always wanted to try and have kids, and...It's just, I get scared that certain things will happen, or...It's not that, Charlie.You're gonna laugh.If we have kids, Charlie, things happen. Kids are healthy and fine, and some aren't, and I don't know if I could live with myself if I gave birth to a child with webbed feet.You're laughing.You think that's silly?It really worries me, Charlie.You're the greatest Charlie.I just wanna look good for you, Charlie. That's all.Do I look okay, Charlie?What's wrong?Oh, yeah.Charlie, your food is getting cold.What's a matter, Charlie?What happened, Charlie?Hello, Charlie.Smile, Charlie. Act like you're having a good time.Don't go, Charlie.I heard you on the phone before, Charlie. There's something I've got to tell you.I've been married before.About my husbands?AAAhhhhhhh!Where are you, Charlie? What's going on?Tony, is that you? It's me, Harriet. I'm in here.Tony, Rose is trying to kill Charlie. They're out on the ledge.Sure, anything. You've got to save Charlie.Look! It's Charlie!I swear to you... It was Charlie... Look!

And this is Harriet's note.'Dear Charlie, I didn't want to wake you, make yourself at home, thanks for making me smile.' Harriet.I'll make you some breakfast.What would you say to blueberry pancakes, bacon, fresh squeezed grape juice and Kona coffee?I'm sorry I didn't have any of those other things.Got 'em.Yes. She's been here the past three months... ever since she came back from Miami. I used to visit her occasionally. She didn't speak of me?She spoke of them...?Well, you know Harriet.But you did have sex with her?Yet you still don't know her. See, that's the problem with sex. It's not very revealing.You should be careful, Charlie.I'm gonna go now. I won't tell Harriet that anything happened.Exactly. Or she would be jealous. And when she gets jealous, we both know what she's capable of.You'll be okay, Charlie. Just be careful.Did you have a nice date last night?He disturbed me while I was naked in the shower this morning.I didn't mind. Charlie and I laughed about it over breakfast.He said you had great sex last night.He seems really stuck on you. I hope for you that it lasts.Well, you can trust me not to tell him anything.I did a sketch of him.Think I've caught him?Charlie really liked it.Boy, I really hope it works out.I thought of calling you.To warn you, Charlie. There are just some things you should know, about Harriet.About her past.Here's the thing. I may have to tell Harriet.That we're lovers.I know, and it's a damn shame.Oh, we do not. Harriet was always prettier than me. And a heck of a lot more popular. She always had boyfriends. The only thing I ever got was good grades.No, Harriet. I don't want to. They're not good.Thanks.I dunno.I dunno.It is titled. It's called \"I dunno\".Bye, Charlie.You're back. But Harriet's not here yet.Sure. That would be fine.I'm glad you asked. I didn't want to be so forward. I mean, if you're waiting inside, then you feel obligated to entertain me and keep up the conversation just to be polite, and really your head might be totally elsewhere and then there's the chance that you would really want to talk and it's me who'd be busy, but in an attempt not to be rude, I sit there and listen to some story that you don't really want to tell and I don't really have time to hear. You know?I think about a lot of things.Okay! What would you like me to do?Harriet's far more talented than I am.Well, I don't think she'd wanna do this sort of...I doubt I'd have any. Harriet hates being photographed.We're in here, Harriet....Charlie wanted a photo of you.Hi, Charlie.Trust your first instincts, Charlie. You never do. It's your big mistake. That and the haircut.Harriet, its for you.Oh, hi!I was just doing a murder series in honor of the wedding.Yes, Harriet, give it to me. She's a butcher. ...She owns a butcher shop.Sorry. No can do.It didn't come out.The picture didn't come out. It was unflattering. In made her look ten pounds heavier. She's my sister.And if she's not innocent. If she's, you know, \"quirky?\"Charlie. Why did you marry Harriet? I warned you not to marry her, didn't I? I warned all of them. But none of them listened to me. They all went ahead and married her. She's the pretty one. Where's Harriet? What have you done with my sister, Harriet?If you've done something to my sister, Harriet, I swear to God I'll kill you.Charlie, did you like your note? I thought it was pretty accurate. I did all the husbands' notes. I can forge anyone's handwriting, I can write in anyone's style. See, I'm an artist. Harriet isn't an artist.
