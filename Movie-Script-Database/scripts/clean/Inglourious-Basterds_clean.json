The Women remain standing. Col Landa leans forward, and says to the Farmer in a low tone ofYou are right.Charlotte, would you take the girls outside. The Colonel and I need to have a few words. The Farmers wife follows her husbands orders, and gathers her daughter's taking them outside, closing the door behind them. The Two Men are alone, at the farmers dinner table, in the Farmers humble home.Oui.By all means. They now speak ENGLISH;Yes.Yes. The Colonel drinks more milk.I've heard, the fuhrer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are ether hiding, or passing for Gentile. The S.S.Colonel smiles.But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me. The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews, and found nothing.To my knowledge those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers. - Heer Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe? Looking up from his papers.Only rumors -Again, this is just a rumor - but we heard the Dreyfusis had made there way into Spain.Yes.We were families in the same community, in the same bussiness. I wouldn't say we were friends, but members of the same community, we had common interest. The S.S. Colonel takes in this answer, seems to except it, then moves to the next question.There were five of them. The father, Jacob... .wife, Miram... her brother, Bob ...Thirty - thirty one?And the children... Amos... and Shoshanna.Amos - six - I believe.

He kisses her hand, then continues without letting go of his hostess hand...please excuse my rude intrusion on your routine.Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have heard in the village about your family are all true. Your wife is a beautiful woman. His eyes leave the mother, and move to the three daughters.Merci be coupe Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine. This being a dairy farm one would be safe in assuming you have milk?Then milk is what I prefer.Monsieur, to both your family, and your cows, I say; Bravo.Please, join me at your table.Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to discuss,' would be better discussed in private. You'll notice, I left my men outdoors- if it wouldn't offend them, could you ask your lovely ladies to step outside.Monsieur LaPadite, I regret to inform you I've exhausted the extent of my French. To continue to speak it so inadequately, would only serve to embarrass me. However, I've been lead to believe you speak English quite well?Well, it just so happens, I do as well. This being your house, I ask your permission to switch to English, for the remainder of the conversation?Monsieur LaPadite, while I'm very familiar with you, and your family. I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am. Are you aware of my existence? The Farmer answers;This is good. Are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?Please tell me what you've heard?The Fuhrer couldn't of said it better himself.I'm aware of that, I read the report on this area. But like any enterprise, when under new management, there's always a slight duplication of efforts. Most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless. I just have A few questions Monsieur LaPadite, if you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family. Taking his black leather attache case, and placing it on the table, he takes out a folder from inside. He also extracts a expensive black fountain pen from his uniform front pocket. Opening the folder, and referring to it;Now before the occupation there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself. The Loveitts, The Doleracs, The Rollins, and The Dreyfus's, is that correct?Please, Monsieur LaPadite, it is your house, make yourself comfortable. The Farmer gets up from the table, goes to his shelf over the fireplace, and removes from it a WOODEN BOX that contains all the fixins to his pipe. He sits back down at the table with his Nazi guest. As The Farmer loads the bowel of his pipe with tobacco, sets a match to it, and begins slowly puffing, making it red hot, the S.S. Colonel studies the papers in front of him.Now according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for - except, The Dreyfusis. Somewhere in the last year it would appear they have vanished. Which leads me to the conclusion that they've ether made good their escape, or someone is very successfully hiding them. (looking up from his papers, across the table at The- I love rumors! Facts can be so misleading, where rumors, true or false are often reveling. So Monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding The Dreyfusis? The Farmerlooks at Landa.Speak freely Monsieur LaPadite, I want to hear what the rumors are, not who told them to you. The Farmer puffs thoughtfully on his pipe.So the rumors you've heard have been of escape?Were the LaPadites and the Dreyfusis friendly? As the Farmer answers this question, the CAMERA LOWERS behind his chair, to the floor, past the floor, to a small area underneath the floorboards revealing;Having never met the Dreyfusis, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?- How old is Bob?Continue.Ages of the children?Well I guess that should do it. Be begins gathering up his papers, and putting them back into his ttache case. the Farmer, cool as a cucumber, puffs on his pipe.However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?But you are aware of what they call me?What are you aware of?Precisely! Now I understand your trepidation in repeating it. Before he was assassinated, Heydrich apparently hated the moniker the good people of Prague bestowed on him. Actually why he would hate the name, \"The Hangman\", is baffling to me It would appear he did everything in his power to earn it. But I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title, precisely because I've earned it. As \"The Jew Hunter\" enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize with the french farmer.The feature that makes me such a effective hunter of the Jews, is, as opposed to most German soldiers, I can think like a jew. where they can only think like a German, or more precisely, a German soldier. Now if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and predatory instinct of a hawk.Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?- Unless some fool is stupid enough to try and handle a live one, rats don't make it a practise of biting human beings. Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that was some time ago. In all your born days, has a rat ever caused you to be sick a day in your life? I purpose to you, any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry. Yet I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?Yet, they are both rodent's, are they not? And except for the fact that one has a big bushy tail, while the other has a long repugnt tail of rodent skin, they even rather look alike, don't they?However, interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel. If a rat were to scamper through your door, this very minute, would you offer it a saucer of your delicious milk?I didn't think so. You don't like them. You don't really know why you don't like them. All you know is, you find them repulsive. (let's theThe other mistake the German soldier make is their severe handling of the citizens who give shelter and aid to the Jews. These citizens are not enemies of the state. They are simply confused people, trying to make some sense out of the madness war creates. These citizens do not need punishing. They simply need to be reminded of their duty in war time. Let's use you as a example Monsieur LaPadite. In this war, you have found yourself in the middle of a conflict that has nothing to do with yourself, your lovely ladies, or your cows - yet, here you are. So Monsieur LaPadite, let me purpose a question. In this time of war, what is your number one duty? Is it to fight the Germans in the name of France to your last breath? Or, is it to harass the occupying army to the best of your ability? Or, is it to protect the poor unfortunate victims of warfare who can not protect themselfs? Or, is your number one duty in this time of bloodshed, to protect those very beautiful women who constitute your family? The Colonel lets the last statement stand.That was a question Monsieur LaPadite. In this time of war, What do you consider your number one duty?Now, my job dictates, that I must have my men enter your home, and conduct a thorough search, before I can officially cross your families name off my list.You are sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?Your sheltering them underneath your floorboards aren't you?Point out to me the area's where their hiding. The Farmer points out the area's on the floor with the Dreyfusis are underneath.Since I haven't heard any disturbance, I assume that while their listening, they don't speak english?I'm going to switch back to french now, and I want you to follow my masquerade - is that clear?Monsieur LaPadite, I thank you for milk, and your hospitably. I do believe our business here is done. The Nazi Officer opens the front door, and silently motions for his son to approach the house.Mademoiselle LaPadite, I thank you for your time, we shant be bothering your family any longer. Yet the LaPadite women watch the Nazi soldiers, machine guns at ready, approach the house. The Soldiers enter the doorway, Col Landa, silently points out area of the floor the Jews are hiding under.So, Monsieur and Madame LaPadite I bid you adieu. otions to the Soldiers with his index finger. wy TEAR UP the wood floor with MACHINE GUN FIRE. The little farm house is filled with SMOKE, DUST, SPLINTERS, SCREAMS, 0ULLET CASINGS, and even alittle BLOOD. With a hand motion from the Colonel, the Soldiers cut off their gunfire. The Colonel keeps his finger in the air to indicate silence.It's the girl. Nobody movesae he crosses the floor, he see's the young girl RUNNING towards the cover of the woods. He unlatches the window, and opens it. Shosanna to perfectly FRAMED in the window sill.Pramed by the window, takes his LUGAR, and straight arm aims at the fleeing Jew, cocking back the hammer with his thumb.Au revoir, Shosanna! Till we meet again!Herman, I sense` a question on your lips? Out with it?Oh, I don't think the state is in too much danger, do you?I'm glad you see it my way. Besides, not putting a bullet in the back of a fifteen year old girl, and allowing her to escape, our not nessessarlly the same thing. She's a young girl, no food, no shelter, no shoes, who's just witnessed the massacre of her entire family. She may not survive the night. And after word spreads about what happened today, it's highly unlikely she will find any willing farmers to extend her aid. If I had to guess her fate, I'd say she'll probably be turned in by some neighbour. Or, she'll be spotted by some German soldier. Or, we'll find her body in the woods, dead from starvation or exposure. Or, perhaps-she'll survive. She will elude capture. She will escape to America. She will move to New York city. Where she will be elected, President of the United States. The S.S. Colonel chuckles at his little funny.Charmed Mademoiselle.Who needs pigs when you have me? Big hearty laugh around the table.Well, as a matter of fact, I do -Splendid. Then Reich Ministers companion mademoiselle Mondino,Actually, in my role as security chief of this joyous German occasion, I'm afraid I must have a word with Mademoiselle Mimieux.That sounded suspiciously like a Private questioning the order of a Colonel? Or am I just being sensitive?No need for concern, you two. As security chief, I simply need to have a chat with the possible new venue's property owner.Have you tried the strudel here?It's not so terrible. So how is it the young Private and yourself came to be acquainted? She's about to answer, when a WAITER approaches.Yes, two strudels, one for myself, and one for the mademoiselle. A cup of espresso, with a container of. steamed milk, on the side. For the Mademoiselle, a glass of milk. Considering Shosanna. grew up on a dairy farm, and the last time she was on a dairy farm, her strudel companion murdered her entire family, his ordering her milk is, to say the least... . disconcerting. The key to Col Landa's power, and or charm, depending on the side ones on, lies in his ability to convince you he's privy to your secrets.So Mademoiselle, you were beginning to explain....?- Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you. This is a simple formality, no reason for you to feel anxious. The Colonel takes one look at it, and says to the Waiter;I apologize, I forgot to order the cream fresh.Wait for the cream. (Back toSo Emmanuelle, explain to me how does it happen, that a young lady such as your self, comes to own a cinema? The Waiter returns, applying cream fresh to the two strudels. The S.S. Colonel looks across the table at his companion, picking up his fork, he says;After you. Shosanna takes \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2a whip creamy bite of strudel, Landa follows her lead.- What is there names?Where are they now?Pity... . Continue.Regrettable.Doing what?Is he any good?Actually one could see where that might be a good trade for them. Can you operate the projectors?Knowing the Reich Minister as I do, I'm quite positive he wouldn't want the success or failure of his illustrious evening, dependent on the prowess of a negro. So if it comes to pass we hold this event at your venue, talented no doubt, as your negro may be, you will operate the projectors. Is that exceptable? As if she has any say.So it would appear our young hero is quite smitten with you?Mademoiselle...?That doesn't mean his feelings aren't romantic.It's sounding more and more romantic by the minute. Landa takes out a handsome looking cigarette case, with a S.S. LOGO on it. Removing on of the fags, he lights it up with a fancy S.S. gold lighter. He offers one to Shosanna.Cigarette?Do you smoke?Then I insist, you must take one. There not French, there German. I hope your not nationalist about your tobacco, to me French cigarettes are a sin against nicotine. She takes one, but makes no move to light it. He inhales deep, and says;I did have some thing else I wanted to ask you, but right now, for the life of me, I can't remember what it is. Oh well, must not of been important. Col Landa stands up, throws some French francs on the table, puts on his grey S.S. cap, touches his finger to his visor, saluting Shosanna, and saying:Till tonight. And with that he's gone. Shosanna breaths a sigh of relief. The CAMERA begins to slowly lower from a MEDIUM CU to her feet ankles and floor. We see her shoes are in a puddle of urine. During her conversation and strudel with the man that exterminated her entire family, shosanna pissed herself. She drops the German cigarette in to the piss puddle by her feet.But that doesnt look like this. This is odd. Looking down he see's something... .bending down, he examines fraulein von Hammersmarks two pretty dress shoes lying on the floor. One shoe is covered in blood.

Carry heavy film cans up the stairs, empty the rat traps, ect,ect...A Max Linder festival.No need, I can manage.Merci.Merci. She busies herself with the marquee letters...My aunt left it to me.I don't have a choice, but your welcome.Oui.\"Admire\", would not be the adjective I would use to describe my feelings towards Fraulein Refensthal.I'm French. We respect directors in our country.Even Germans. Merci for assistance, Private. Adieu. She turns to go back inside.I'll finish in the morning. She opens the door to go inside.You wish to see my papers? She hands him her excellently forged papers. That's obviously not what he meant, but he takes them anyway to read her name.Merci. Are you finished with my papers? He hands them back.Oui, Madame.Out, Madame.Out, Madame.Even on the roof I can't smoke a cigarette without hearing Madames voice yelling at me. That's why I do it. To hear Madames voice again.I know. I'm fine, darling. I'll be to bed soon. Marcel goes back inside, Shosanna smokes.Look Fredrick -Yes....Look, you seem a pleasant enough fellow -Your welcome. - regardless, I want you to stop pestering me.I don't wish to be your friend.Don't act like a infant. You know why.Not to me. If you are so desperate for a French girlfriend, I suggest you try Vichy? Just then TWO OTHER GERMAN SOLDIERS come over, obviously very impressed with Fredrick. They make a fuss over him in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN, which nether Shosanna, or the non German speaking members of the movies audience, can understand. He signs autographs for them, shakes their hands, and they go on their way. Shosanna's eyes narrow.Who are you?Your not just a German soldier, are you somebodies son?Yeah, but your not just somebody. What are you, Hitlers nephew? He leans in across the table, she leans in too, and he says;Really?Then what is it? What are you, a German movie star?, what does that mean, \"not exactly\". I asked if you were a movie star, the answer to that question, is yes or no. Fredrick laughs at that line.You were raised by Helga?And your mother and father?is your cinema still operatiing?What's it called?How has it done durring the war?No doubt, you don't have to operate under a curfew., not since before the war.Of course, but that's not likely to happen. TWO MORE GERMAN SOLDIERS and their TWO FRENCH DATES approach the table. They ask for Fredricks autograph, he signs it for them. One of the French Girls says in FRENCH, how exciting it is to meet a real live German war hero. Shosanna hears it. They leave. So that's it, she thinks.So your a war hero? Why didn't you tell me?What did you do? He takes a sip of beer.Wow.What's a bird's nest?How many Russian's did you kill?Maybe they'll make a film about your exploits.\"Nation's Pride\" is about you? \"Nation's Pride\" is starring you?Not so comical. So what are you doing in Paris, enjoying a rest?Well, good luck with your premier Private. I hope all goes well for Joseph and yourself. Au revoir. And with that, she disappears. Leaving the perplexed private alone.Oui? Telling his Driver in German to ask her in French;I don't understand, what have I done?Then I demand to know what this is about, and where do you propose to take me? The Driver begins to translate, when the Gestapo Major holds up his hand, telling him not to bother. The Major looks at the young French girl and tells her in German;Invitation?Bon jour.Three hundred and fifty.My cinema , on German night, tends to show older German classics. Francesca interprets...I draw a older German audience in my cinema, that appreciate the nostalgia of the earlier time. Francesca interprets...No.Oui.The cinema originally belonged to my aunt and uncle - Col Landa removes alittle black book from his pocket.Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux. He records the names in his little book.My uncle was killed during blitzkrieg.Aunt Ada passed away from fever last spring.'Yes, he's a Frenchman. His name is Marcel. He worked with my aunt and uncle since they opened the cinema. He's the only other one who works with me.Projectionist.The best.Of course I can.Oui. Col Landa takes another bite of strudel, Shosanna follows suit.Private Zollers feelings for me aren't of a romantic nature.Colonel, his feelings are not romantic. I remind him of his sister.I remind him of his sister who raised him.No thank you.Yes.watches all this from a opera box, she shakes her head in disbelief.It looks like we're suppose to have a Nazi premier.Well, I need to speak with you about that.About these Hun swine, commandeering our cinema.Well, when I was watching the bosch (Said inFilling the cinema with Nazi's and their whores, and burning it down to the ground.No, we're talking about that, right now. If we can keep this place from burning down by ourselves, we can burn it down by ourselves.No, Marcel, just for sake of argument, if we wanted to burn down the cinema, for any number of reasons, you and I could physically accomplish that, no?And with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate film print collection, we wouldn't even need explosives, would we?Oui, that's exactly what I mean. She begins kissing his hands.Because Marcel, my sweet, we're going to make a film. Just for the Nazi's.What is a sync mark?How do we do that?Ready.Do you know one person who can do both things?In a wolf fight, you ether eat the wolf, or the wolf eats you. If we're going to obliterate the Nazi's, we have to use their tactics.We find somebody who can develop and process a35mm print. And we make them do it, or we kill them. Once we tell them what we want to do, if they refuse, we have to kill them anyway, or they'll turn us in.Like that. Snaps her fingers.Bring that fucker over here! Put his head down on that table. Marcel, holds his arm behind him, as he forces his head flat against the table top. Shosanna brings a HATCHET DOWN DEEP into the table, just by his face.You ether do what the fuck we tell you to, or I'll bury this axe in your collaborating skull.Then prove it! Or does your manhood go no deeper, then standing to piss? Marcel, does his wife, and children know you?Then after we kill this dog for Germans, we'll go and silence them. She lifts up the hatchet, raises it high...Prepare to die, collaborator fucker!Shut up fool. Marcel lifts up the veil covering her face, and their lips meet.Cheeky black bugger. I have to go down and socialize with these Hun pigs. Let's go over it again?Okay, the big sniper battle in the film begins around the middle of the third reel. Our film, comes on in the forth reel, so Somewhere towards the end of the third reel, go down and lock the doors of the auditorium. Then take your place behind the screen, and wait for my CUE, when I give it to you, BURN IT DOWN!Bon jour.Prego.What are you doing here?Can't you see how busy I am?Fredrick it's not funny, you can't be here. This is your premiere, you need to be out there with them. As Fredrick prepares to tell his little tale, with all the charm at his command, Shosanna listens, knowing the third reel is just about over, and her big reel change is coming up.Fredrick, I am sorry, but -I have to get prepared for the reel change.No.I said, no.Are you so use to the Nazi's kissing your ass, you've forgotten what the word,\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0No\" means? No Fredrick, you can't come in here, now go away! No subtitles for Fredrick needed this time, he gets it. He does a one-armed PILE DRIVE PUSH on the door, knocking both it OPEN, and Shosanna back into the room. Fredrick, a different cat then we've seen up till now, enters the booth, closing the door behind him, and LOCKING it.

It makes me feel both closer to them, and a little homesick at the same time.The Kino Haus.Actually, in Germany, cinema attendance is up.How often do you fill your house?So if you had one big engagement, that would help you out?Everybody knows that, I liked you didn't.I've shot the most enemy soldiers in world war two...so far. You bet your sweet ass that got her attention.I was alone in a bell tower in a walled off city in Russia. It was myself, and a thousand rounds of ammo, in a bird's nest, against three hundred Soviet soldiers.A bird's nest is what a sniper would call a bell tower. It's a high structure, offering a three hundred and sixty degree view. Very advantageous for marksmen.Sixty-eight.Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels thought. So he did. It's called \"Nation's Pride\", and guess what, they wanted me to play myself, so I did. They have posters for it in kiosks all over Paris. That's another reason for all the attention.I know, comical, huh?Hardly. I've been doing publicity, having my picture taken with different German luminaries, visiting troops, that sort of thing. Goebbels wants the film to premier in Paris, so I've been helping them in the planning. Joseph is very keen on this film. He's telling anybody who will listen, when \"Nation's Pride\" is released, I'll be the German Van Johnson. Shosanna, wasn't falling for the young German, by any stretch. However his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can't help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as \"Joseph\", like their friends, is all she needed to get on the right side of things. This young man is trouble with a capital \"T\", and she needs to stay far fucking away from him. She abruptly rises, and says;Good you came. I wasn't sure weather or not you'd except my invitation.Yes it is, beer Goebbels. Emmanuelle, there is somebody I want you to meet. Joseph Goebbels, remaining seated, looks up at the young French girl, scrutinizing her as he spoons creme brule into his mouth. The excited Fredrick introduces Shosanna to the propaganda minister formally.Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to introduce you to the minister of propaganda, the leader of the entire German film industry, and now I'm a actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels. Goebbels offers up his long spider-like fingers for Shosanna to shake. She does.And normally, this is beer Goebbels French interpreter, Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.And you've met the Major. The Gestapo officer steps up and says, to Fredrick in German;- Heer Goebbels, I haven't informed her yet.I wanted to inform her.But beer Goebbels, that's not such a terrible thing. You said yourself you didn't want to indulge every two faced french bourgeois taking up space currying favor. With less seat's it makes the event more exclusive. Your not trying to fill the house, their fightin g for seats.Along with being a cinema owner, Emmanuelle is quite a formidable film critic. He chuckles, but alone.Why don't you screen \"Lucky Kids\"? I'm sure Emmanuelle hasn't seen. it. And it's so funny, I've been meaning to recommend it to her, for her German night. That's a great idea, let's watch \"Lucky Kids\" tonight.Shosanna, this4pol Hans Landa of the SS., he'll be running security for the premier.What sort of discussion?Nothing could be further from the truth Colonel. Your authority is beyond question. But your reputation does proceed you. Should Mademoiselle Mimieux or myself be concerned?I was just hoping to escort Mademoiselle Mimieux back to her cinema.Are you the manager, of this cinema? I want my money back. That actor in the movie stinks. He laughs.I came to visit you.Then allow me to lend a assist.Normally, you would be.right. And for all the other films I do, I intend to endure evenings like tonight, in the proper sprit. However the fact remains, this film, is based on my military exploits. And in this case, my exploits consisted of me killing many men. Consequently, the part of the film that's playing now,... .I don't like watching this part.- So, I thought, I'd come up here and do what I do best, annoy you. And from the look on your face, it would appear I haven't lost my touch.Let me do it?Oh please, it's been two years since i've done a reel change.Come on, it's my premiere.Well, it's nice to know you can feel something. Even if it's just physical pain. Fredrick steps forward... Shosanna steps backwards...I'm not a man you say, \"Go away\" to. There's over three hundred dead bodies in Russia, that if they could, would testify to that. After what I've done for you, you disrespect me at your peril.What the hell was that? While Fredrick's back is turned, Shosanna takes a GUN out of her pocket, and SHOOTS Fredrick THREE TIMES in the back... ..Be CRASHES HARD into the door, then FALLING FACE FIRST to the floor... Shosanna, gun in hand, looks out projection booth window into the audience... The ON SCREEN BATTLE rages so LOUDLY with GUNFIRE, that her weapon didn't stand a chance of being heard. Her eyes go from the audience... .up to the big screen... .Which holds FREDRICK ZOLLER in a tight handsome CLOSE UP.

He looks to Francesca to translate, but she's just taken a big bite of terri misu. They all laugh. Fredrick jumps in...well I must say, you've made quite a impression on our boy.

For the Fuhrer and Private Zoller, I wait. Francesca interprets...So finally, I'm granted a audience with the young Private, and he spends the entire lunch speaking of you and your cinema. Francesca interprets...So Fraulein Mimieux, let's get down to business. Private Zoller interrupts -Unless the girls a simpleton, I'm sure she's figured it out by now, after all she does operate a cinema. Francesca, tell her. Francesca tells Shosanna in French;Nonsense. Until I ask a few questions, he has nothing to inform. Let the record state, I have not agreed to a venue change.You have opera boxes?More would be better. How many seats in your auditorium?That's almost four hundred less then The Ritz. Fredrick jumps in...I see your public speaking has improved. It appears I've created a monster. A strangely persuasive monster. When the war's over, politics awaits. Table chuckles.Well Private, though it is true, I'm inclined to indulge you anything. I must watch a film in this young ladies cinema before I can say, yes or no. So young lady, you are to close your cinema tonight, and have a private screening me. Francesca interprets...What German films do you have? Francesca asks..Why not my films? Francesca asks...That's nonsense fraulein. Us Germans are looking forward, not backwards. That era of German cinema is dead. The German cinema I create, will not only be thee cinema of Europe. But the worlds only alternative to the degenerate Jewish influence of Hollywood. Fredrick Jumps in...WSo it would appear. Unfortunately for the fraulein, I've outlawed film criticism. Zoller, thinking fast, says;Ahhh, \"Lucky Kids\", \"Lucky Kids\", \"Lucky Kids\". When all is said and done, my most purely enjoyable production. Not only that, I wouldn't be surprised, if sixty years from now, It's \"Lucky Kids\" that I'm the most remembered for. I know it doesn't seem like it now, but mark my words. Very well, I'll have a print sent over to the fraulein'.s cinema. We'll screen \"Lucky Kids\" tonight.Ah Landa, your here, this is the young lady in question. The S.S. Officer sits down, and it's our old friend from the first scene COL HANS LANDA.Oh Francesca, what was that funny thing the Fuhrer said about Hans?You know, you were there, it was a funny thing the Fuhrer said, about Hans...Something about a pig?

So the Fuhrer said, he wouldn't be surprised if Hans weren't rooting out Jews like a truffle pig from the play pen.Do you have a engagement tonight?- Break it. We're all going to the Fraulein's cinema tonight to view \"Lucky Kids\".Slave driver! French slave driver! They all chuckle. Everybody begins to stand up from the table... ..Francesca gathers the stupid dogs... .as Col Landa stands, he says;Hans, the boy means no harm, he's simply smitten. And he's correct. Your reputation does proceed you. Laughter all around. The Reich Minister and his axis entourage, make their way to front of the cafe, with the two dumb dogs on a leash, leading the way.Nonsense! You can eat ice cream, and walk along the Sienne another time. Right now, allow Col Landa to do his job. Everybody saystheir farewells. Col Landa offers the young jew in hiding a seat at a small table in the outside patio area of Maxims. The fluency and poetic proficiency of the S.S. jew hunters french, revels to the audience, that his feigning clumsiness at french with Monsieur Lapadite in the films first scene, was simply a interrogation-technique.I must say, I appreciate the modesty of this auditorium. Your Cinema has real respect, almost church like. Not to say we couldn't spruce the place up a bit. In Versailles there's a crystal chandelier hanging in the banquet hall that is extraordinary. we're going to get it, and hang it from the very middle of auditorium roof. Also I want to go to Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes, and just scatter them about the lobby.Perfectly understandable, dear boy. You go now, and we'll see you after the show. He exits the opera box.

As well as our sister publication.\"Flickers Bi-Monthly\". And I've had two books published.\"Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci\". It's a subtexual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.All the way down, sir.Pardon sir?Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema. A alternative to what he considers the Jewish German intellectual cinema of the twenties. And the Jewish controlled dogma of Hollywood. SUDDENLY... Bellowing from the back of the room;Quite well, actually. Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years. But Louis B.Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels proper opposite number. I believe Goebbels see's himself closer to David O.Selznick. Gen.Fenech looks to the Prime Minister. With a puff of cigar smoke, Churchell says;- What film sir? The General has to resort to peeking at his file.Oh, you mean the film about Private Zoller?But it's called \"Nation's Pride\"?I can tell you what it's about, it's about Private Fredrick Zoller. He's the German Sgt.York. Fenech can't help suppress a smile, they have the right man.The master race at play, aye?\"...and like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth\". Jolly good, sir.\"The Basterds\", never heard of them.Why do they call him that?Scalps, sir?Rather gruesome sounding little Dicky bird, isn't he?Indeed. General Fenech continues on with his exposition, moving over to a military map.How will I know her?Bridget Von Hammersmark? The German movie star is working for England?I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles. The three British bulldogs laugh.I didn't know.it is a tavern.We wait. Don't worry, she's a British spy, she'll make the rendez-vous. WE SEE the other Basterds, dressed in French civilian clothes, are in the room as well, they are, Donowitz, Hirschberg, and Utivich. And in the back of the room, dressed in the grey uniform of a S.S. Lieutenant, Hugo Stiglitz sits off by himself, sharpening his S.S. DAGGER on his leather belt looped around his boot. Anybody not in the scene from the Basterds opening chapter, is dead. Lt.Hicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side of the room, SHARPENS his dagger menacingly. .Stiglitz is fucking werid... Lt.Hicox approaches Stiglitz...I hear your pretty good with that? Meaning the blade. Stiglitz doesn't answer.You know, we're not looking for trouble, right now. We're simply making contact with our agent. Should be uneventful. However, on the off chance I'm wrong, and things prove eventful. I need to know, we can all remain calm.Well, now you put it like that, I guess you do. He turns his attention back to his blade. Hicox moves over to Aldo, and asks him privately;Fair point, Lieutenant.If we get into trouble, we can handle it. But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for matter, escape from that basement. If Frau Von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.She chose the spot.Look, she's not a military strategist. She's just a actress.She wasn't picking a place to fight. She was picking a place, isolated, and without germans.Shit. Sgt.Donowitz chides him;- Obviously, I don't know,Sgt. The British officer watches the German soldier, who's not suppose to be there. When Hugo Stiglitz joins him at the window. Stiglitz looks down at the urinating Nazi, S.S. dagger in hand.No hurry, Frau Von Hammersmark. Take your time, enjoy yourself.I thought this place was suppose to have more French then Germans?She's right, just be calm, and enjoy your booze.Why?None of your business,Sgt. You might not have worn out your welcome with the fraulein, with your drunken boorish behavior, but you have wore out your welcome with me. The Table of game playing Soldiers, hear this, and get quiet.Might I remind you Sgt.,your a enlisted man. This is a officers table. I suggest you stop pestering the fraulein, and rejoin your table. The German Master Sgt., looks quizzically at the officer.I was born in the village that rests in the shadow of Piz Palu.Yes. In that village we all speak like this. Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?In that scene was myself, my father, my sister, and my two brothers. My brother is so handsome, the director Pabst, gave him a Close Up.

Major Helistrom lifts up his beer stein, and toasts;Why do you have a Luger pointed at my testicles?Well, -Major -I was saying that makes two of us.

The taverns PROPRIETOR, a older, big bellyed Frenchman named EARL, comes over to the table, and pours more champagne into Bridget's Champagne glass.

The Sgt over there's wife, just had a baby. His commanding officer gave him, and his mates the night off to celebrate.F No, we should stay. For one drink at least. I've been waiting for you in a bar, it would look strange if we left before we had a drink.There's been some new developments. The cinema venue has changed.No one knows. But that in itself shouldn't be a problem. The cinema it's been changed to is considerably smaller then The Ritz. So whatever materials you brought for The Ritz, should be doubly effective here. Now this next piece of information is colossal, try not to over react. The Fubrer, will be attending tomorrow. Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT TAKE. Bridget's eyes bore holes in him.You'll be going as Ernst Schuller. You'll say your a associate producer on Riefenstahl's \"Tiefland\". It's the one German production not under Goebbels control, and Leni wouldn't be caught dead at a Goebbels film affair..the films gone through many delays, and Leni's heath is deteriorating, so if you have to speak... Hicox, seeing the German Master Sgt approach, signals for her to cool it.I'd love to Wilhelm. This handsome happy Sgt, just became a father today. The Pretend Officers offer congratulations to the Sgt. The German Master Sgt, CLICKS his heels, and bows before his superior officers.So Wilhelm, do you know the name of this progeny yet?There you go. But wait, I'm not finished yet. She reaches into her clutch, and pulls out some lipstick. Applies some ruby red color to her lips, and then kisses the napkin, leaving a big red lip print. Then hands the treasured item to the young father.Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.Major, if my word means anything, I can vouch for everything the Young Cap't has just said. He does hail from the bottom of Piz Palu, he was in the film, and his brother is far more handsome then he. The impostors laugh. Then....so does the Gestapo Major. He turns to the Sgt.By all means, Major. The Gestapo Major sits at the table, opposite Lt.Hicox, and Wicki. The French Barmaid brings over the Majors beer stein.The Captain is my date, but all three are my guests. We're old friends Major, who go back along time. Longer then a actress would care to admit. Chuckle chuckle.I'll drink to that.okay, one game.No.Don't be ridiculous, obviously he wasn't born in America.Of course not, Major.Nor I. I'll stay with bubbly. Lt.Bicox, hold up three fingers , to Eric the owner.- Major -Then Major, i implore you. For the sake of those German troops, will you please leave with us?He was a enemy soldier, who knew who I was. He couldn't live.Few questions about what?The British officer blew his German act, and a Gestapo Major saw it.I can see, since you didn't see what happened inside, the Nazi's being there must look odd.The English man, gave himself away.He ordered three glasses. She holds up three fingers, index to pinky.We order, three glasses. She holds up three fingers, thumb to index.That's the German three. The other is odd. Germans would, and did notice it.Tuxedos. To get them into the premiere, wearing military uniforms, with all the military there, would of been suicide. But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos, and blend in with everybody else. I arranged a tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.Hand me my purse. They do. And she opens it, and takes out three tickets to the film premiere.Lt.Hicox was going as my escort. The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.Can you speak German better then your friends, no. Have I been shot, yes. I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up the red carpet any time soon. Least of all by tomorrow night.It probably has something to do with the second development.The Fuhrer's attending the premiere.The venue change, two weeks ago. The Fuhrer's attendance, four days ago.We need to get something straight, once and for all. Everything London knows, it learned from me. If I don't know, London doesn't know. So now, this is me, informing you, Hitler's coming to Paris.What are you thinking?What's that suppose to mean?I'm going to probably end up losing this leg, bye bye acting career, fun while it lasted. How do you expect me to walk up a red carpet?I don't. I like smoking, drinking, and ordering in restaurants, but I see your point.Splendid. When the Nazi's put me up against a wall, it won't hurt so much. I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you American's speak any other language then English?Preferably. Donny referring to Aldo and himself.With a atrocious accent, no doubt. But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib. Germans don't have a good ear for Italian. So you mumble Italian, and brazen through it, is that the plan?That sounds good.No, it's good. If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building. So, who does what?What about the little one?I didn't mean any offence.You Americans are fucking useless!But there is a problem. I'm a movie star. This is a movie premiere. I can't show up looking like I was just in a Nazi gun fight. Now I have a dress for the premiere at my hotel. But sometime tomorrow, I have to get my hair done.

I know too many of your former conquests, to fall into that honey pot. Chuckle-chuckle...Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I might add, at mountain climbing. And this was the result.Believe it or not, yes it is. A brief moment passes between the two...Well, I chant be doing it again, I can tell you that.Very good eye, Colonel.

That's how you injured your leg, mountain climbing?Forgive me, fraulein. I don't mean laugh at your misfortune. It's just .mountain climbing? I'm curious fraulein, what could of ever compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavor? The Double meaning is not lost on the German actress.That cast looks as fresh as my old Uncle Gustave, when were you climbing this mountain, last night?Hummm. And where exactly in Paris is this mountain? This stops her for a seconded. Then Landa laughs it off, taking them off the hook.I'm just teasing you, fraulein. You know me, I tease rough. So who are your three handsome escorts?Margheriti...?Nargheriti.Dominick Decocco?Bravo... . Bravo.Have a seat fraulein. Pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk. She lowers herself in the chair. Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk, opposite her. The SS Colonel pulls another little chair over, and places it in front of the fraulein. He sits. Their knees almost touching. The colonel points to the foot not in the cast.Put your foot in my lap.I assure you fraulein, my intention is not to flirt. Patting his lap more with more aggression. The nervous fraulein, lifts up her strapy dress shoe enclosed foot, and places it in the Colonel's lap. The Colonel, very delicately, unfastens the thin straps that hold the frauleins shoe on her foot... .He removes the shoe... .Leaving only the frauleins bare foot...What's that American expression... \"if the shoe fits...you must wear it\". He removes her foot from his lap.Inform The Fuhrer the audience has taken there seats, and we're ready to begin. Step one, in Hans master plan, done. He then dials another number...As Stanley said to Livingston; Lt.Aldo Raine, I presume?You've had a nice long run, Aldo. Alas, your now in the hands of the SS. My hands to be exact. And they've been waiting along time, to touch you. He reaches out with his finger, and lightly touches Aldo's face right in the middle of the hood. Aldo's head VIOLENTLY FLINCHES.Caught ya flinching. In German, he orders the men put Aldo in the back of a truck. Aldo, bound, and bagged, is put in the truck. Also in the truck is Utivich, wearing a makeshift chauffeurs uniform, bound, and bagged like the Lieutenant. The Truck drives off. Col.Landa turns around, and SEES FROM A DISTANCE, Hitlers motorcade pull up to the cinema.. Then the Fuhrer, Goebbels, Francesca, and the rest of the entourage, make there way down the red carpet into the cinema. Landa smiles.Italian? Really?I speak a little Tagalog, but I wouldn't begin to presume I could pass for Filipino. Don't get me wrong, I understand you were in a pickle, what with you losing your Germans. And I have nothing but admiration for improvisation. Still.... Chico Marx is more convincing. if the three of you had shown up to the premiere dressed in womans attire, it would have been more convincing. Landas eyes go to the Two Nazi Guards behind the prisoners.So your Aldo the Apache?Jew Hunter, , I'm a detective. A damn good detective. Finding people is my specialty.

Explosives, still around there ankle, still ready to explode. And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go. The two Basterds don't believe this. It can't be true.However, all I have to do, is pick pick up that phone right there. Inform the cinema, and your plans kupet.So gentlemen, lets discuss the prospect of ending the war-tonight. All three have their Chianti filled glasses.So the way I see it, since Hitlers death, or possible rescue, rests solely on my reaction...If I do nothing ...it's as if I'm causing his death, even more then yourselves. Would you agree?How about you Uitivich?Good, we more or less, all agree. Gentlemen, I have no intention, of Killing Hitler, and killing Goebbels, and Killing Gerring, and killing Boorman, not to mention winning the war single handedly for the allies, only later, to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.If you want to win the war, tonight, We have to make a deal.The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make. However, I'm sure this mission of yours, has a commanding officer? A General, I'm betting. For ..Oooh, that's a bingo. Is that the way you say it, That's a bingo?Bingo! How fun. But I digress, where were we? Oh yes, make a deal. Over there is a very capable two way radio. And sitting behind it, is a more then capable radio operator, named Herrman. Get me somebody on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen, to authorize my - Let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender, if that taste better going down..So, when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded, that I was part of \"Operation Rino\" from the very beginning, as a double agent. Anything I've done in my guise as a SS Colonel, was sanctioned by The O.S.S., as a necessary evil to establish my cover with The Germans. And it was my placement, of Lt.Raines dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels opera box that assured there demise. By the way, that last part is actually true.I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank. I want to receive the congregational medal of honor, for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.In fact, I want all the members of \"Operation Kino\" to receive the congregational medal of honor. Full citizenship for myself - but that goes without saying. And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantuckett island, as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist party to a swifter then imanged end. Do you have all that, sir?So I suppose the only thing left to do is lift a glass, and toast to Donowitz and Hirschbergs success. You too Herrman, come over here. The four men, Col.Hans Landa, Lt.Aldo Raine, Pvt.Smithson Uitivich, and Herrman, lift up four glasses of wine.Gentlemen, To history, and it's Witnesses.Okay Gentlemen, you can climb down.Herrman, hand them your weapon. He does. Col.Landa hands over his LUGER, and his very cool looking SSI am officially surrendering myself over to you, Lt.Raine. We are your prisoners.Is that really necessary? As Uitivich cuffs the. Colonels hands behind his back, AldoAre you mad? What have you done? I made a deal with your General for that mans life!You'll be shot for this.", "clean_line": "ahhh hugo ve moved world lieutenant record insubordination truly remarkable ones pointing atit appear somebodies missing somebody fashionable screen soldier voice cries want everybody room start leave means goddamnit rush walks patient hospital bed sgt willi yes alive landa pulls chair bed sits speak sgt tell happened think bubble dissolves away reveling entrance perfect cue walks bridget von hammersmark dressed lovely leg big white cast basterds tuxedos flank fraulein von hammersmark befallen germany elegant swan flattery fraulein chuckle air kiss happened lovely leg product kicking ass german cinema doubt seriously happened mountain climbing injured leg mountain climbing forgive fraulein mean laugh misfortune mountain climbing curious fraulein compelled undertake foolhardy endeavor double meaning lost german actress cast looks fresh old uncle gustave climbing mountain night hummm exactly paris mountain stops seconded landa laughs taking hook teasing fraulein know tease rough handsome escorts margheriti nargheriti dominick decocco bravo bravo seat fraulein pointing lone chair desk lowers chair instead moving desk opposite ss colonel pulls little chair places fraulein sits knees touching colonel points foot cast foot lap assure fraulein intention flirt patting lap aggression nervous fraulein lifts strapy dress shoe enclosed foot places colonel lap colonel delicately unfastens straps hold frauleins shoe foot removes shoe leaving frauleins bare foot american expression shoe fits wear removes foot lap inform fuhrer audience taken seats ready begin step hans master plan dials number stanley said livingston lt aldo raine presume ve nice long run aldo alas hands ss hands exact ve waiting time touch reaches finger lightly touches aldo face right middle hood aldo head violently flinches caught ya flinching german orders men aldo truck aldo bound bagged truck truck utivich wearing makeshift chauffeurs uniform bound bagged like lieutenant truck drives col landa turns sees distance hitlers motorcade pull cinema fuhrer goebbels francesca rest entourage way red carpet cinema landa smiles italian speak little tagalog wouldn begin presume pass filipino wrong understand pickle losing germans admiration improvisation chico marx convincing shown premiere dressed womans attire convincing landas eyes nazi guards prisoners aldo apache jew hunter detective damn good detective finding people specialty naturally worked nazi finding people yes jews jew hunter stuck control nicknames enemies bestow aldo apache little man germans nickname little ether means point little surprised tall real life mean little fellow circus midget little reputation suggest bridget von hammersmark oh sure big bubbling cesspool hell devil reserves traitors ilk lt aldo think wouldn interrogate single swastika marked survivors simply aren operating level mutual respect assumed whereabouts italian saboteurs moment hirschberg donowitz sitting seats left seats memory serves explosives ankle ready explode mission terrorist plot moment basterds believe true pick pick phone right inform cinema plans kupet gentlemen lets discuss prospect ending war tonight chianti filled glasses way hitlers death possible rescue rests solely reaction causing death agree uitivich good agree gentlemen intention killing hitler killing goebbels killing gerring killing boorman mention winning war single handedly allies later standing jewish tribunal want win war tonight deal kind wouldn authority sure mission commanding officer general betting oooh bingo way bingo bingo fun digress oh yes deal capable way radio sitting capable radio operator named herrman somebody end radio power pen authorize let terms conditional surrender taste better going military history night written recorded operation rino beginning double agent ve guise ss colonel sanctioned necessary evil establish cover germans placement lt raines dynamite hitler goebbels opera box assured demise way actually true want military pension benefits proper rank want receive congregational medal honor invaluable assistance toppling reich fact want members operation kino receive congregational medal honor citizenship goes saying like united states america purchase property nantuckett island reward countless lives ve saved bringing tyranny national socialist party swifter imanged end sir suppose thing left lift glass toast donowitz hirschbergs success herrman come men col hans landa lt aldo raine pvt smithson uitivich herrman lift glasses wine gentlemen history witnesses okay gentlemen climb herrman hand weapon col landa hands luger cool looking ssi officially surrendering lt raine prisoners necessary uitivich cuffs colonels hands aldoare mad deal general mans life ll shot"}}}
