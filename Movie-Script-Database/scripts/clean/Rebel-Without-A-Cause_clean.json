I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does. We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill. Big deal. So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming. He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left. And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me. Then I ran out of the house.I was just talking a walk. I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them. I hate my life. I just hate it.No.No. I don't even know why I do it.I'll never get close to anybody.You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!

Since when? Since I got to be sixteen?May I please be excused?Is he your friend?What's he like?Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?Want to finish my hamburger?

I'm so embarrassed I could die!There's just one thing. What about--Yes. And so terribly annoying when they cry.

Do you think it never stops?Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it. Go- go-go!I'm here.No. In the morning.I just have a feeling.The shadows are getting long.You know something?You watch too much television.I'm cute, too.Meaning me?Chicken?You shouldn't call me that.You always at ringside? You always travel in this rank company?I thought only punks fought with knives.Machismo?I don't want trouble.All right--you want it, you got it!You satisfied or you want more?Where can we meet?Sure--that's all I do.Nothing.I scratched my mosquito bites.

Don't.Yes.I'm not hungry.Hey--I want to ask you something.Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor. Would you do it?What would you do, Dad?Blood.The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?We don't have time.What can you do when you have to be a man?Just give me a direct answer! You going to stop me from going, Dad?Ten years? Now, Dad--I need an answer now!How'd you get here?Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.No. It's okay.Stay there.Jim Stark.Hi.Sure. It's fine.Yeah.Buzz? What are we doing this for?Judy.Me too.Thank you.Where's Buzz! Where's Buzz!Judy. Will you be okay?I got to go in. You better get home too. Hey--what?Who has?Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...Yeah.I have to talk to someone, Mom. I have to talk to you both. And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?I was in it.It doesn't matter how. I was driving a stolen car--Mom--I'm not--She never wants to hear. She doesn't care!I told you Dad, it was a question of honor. They called me chicken-- you know, chicken! I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again. So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other. We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff. I got out okay but Buzz didn't. He was killed.I can't keep it to myself anymore--That's not what I mean. I've never done anything right. I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it. I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.Are you listening to me? You're involved in this! I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?I don't think so--What's that got to do with it?Except yourself!You don't want me to go.But I am involved! We're all involved, Mom! A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!No! It's nothing! Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth. You think you can just turn that off?Just tell a little white lie?I don't want to learn that!No! You're not tearing me loose any more.You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom. Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse. Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away. Dad?You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something Mom?Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?Dad?Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him. It's very important.Listen--My parents know I'm out. They know I'm here.I'll wait for him.They saw where I jumped! I didn't chicken! What do I have to do-- kill myself?You were looking for me, weren't you?I tried to call you before.Want some milk?That's all I can do when I'm nervous. Drink milk. Here--have a slug.You still pretty upset?You cold?I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody! Judy, what am I going to do? I can't go home again.No? Why not? You know something? Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday. Isn't that dumb?Every day I look in the mirror and say, \"What? You still here?\" Man!Hey! You smiled!Like even today. I woke up this morning, you know? And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.I don't think you trust anybody, do you?I'm getting that way, too.Sure. Lots of times.Awful? No. It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time.I felt like it.Where you going?Where can we go? I can't go back into that zoo.Listen! I know a place! PLATO showed me before. An old deserted mansion near the planetarium Would you go with me?You can trust me, Judy.Who's that!How'd you find me? What's happening?Yeah?We know.Judy.Hey where'd you go?Come out come out wherever you are!No. I'm scared.Wow! Well now-there-then!Wowee ow wow! Let's take it for the summer.No--come on. Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?Why don't we just rent it for the season?Well--we're newlyweds.Of course. Drown them like puppies.Nobody talks to children! They just tell them one thing and mean another.What?We'll take it!Quick! Fill the pool!Let's see how long we can stay under.I'm what? What?I bet you hear everything I say!Hey! How 'bout that!Not lately.How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?No. Seriously. What's your trouble?When was that?Who?You remember that far back? Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.You told me he's a big wheel in New York!Sure.You have a long life-line.Ever been in a place like this before?How many rooms do you think there are?Should we explore?Hey! Will you look at this room! Judy?Want to read any books? Take your pick! Isn't this the craziest?Hi.What?Why?Maybe he's scared of the dark.Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--There's something I should tell you, Judy.What a relief!You disappointed?What?So do you.It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.It is for me too.I mean it too.Plato!Your father!You crazy nut! You crazy, crazy nut!Plato!Plato!Plato!Plato!Plato!No!No! I got to find him.He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him. He needed us.He needs you too. Come on.Sure. He was trying to make us his family.Plato?Plato? Plato, you in there? Hey, I'm going to open the door now. You'll be able to see me and you can shoot me if you want, but just remember one thing, Plato--You're my friend. That means a lot to me.Plato?Boy, I'm blind as a bat! You got a match? I'm going to break my neck in here. Where are you?I know. Light a match, will you?That's swell. How are you?No. At dawn.I just have a feeling. Where are you?Well, stop hiding and stand up. I can't talk to you if I don't see you.Hey, look at the stars, Plato. Stand up and look at the stars.That's fine.I'm not going to hurt you.We didn't run out. We were coming right back.Sure I'm sure. Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?I promise nothing'll happen if you do. You want my jacket? It's warm.What do you think?You want to give me your gun now, Plato?In your pocket. Give it to me.You trust me, don't you? Just give it to me for a second.Friends never break promises, do they? Okay. Here. Now listen. There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe. You understand that? They said I could come in and bring you out.They like you. Okay?Just a guard.But you didn't hurt anybody.Ray! Will you tell these guys to move back?Plato! Don't be a fool!Plato!But I've got the bullets! The gun was empty!Plato? Plato.
