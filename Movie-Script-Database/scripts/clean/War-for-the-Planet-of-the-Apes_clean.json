{"War-for-the-Planet-of-the-Apes": {"THE COLONEL": {"raw_line": "Who is this?Where are you, soldier? I need your position.What do you see?You're in command now.By yourself?I understand, soldier. Just kill as many as you can.99, target acquired!......Repeat, target is down! I got him. Let's go! I can get out from here!Get me out! Now!!Grant and Lee... Wellington and Napoleon...Custer... and Sitting Bull. You're probably not much of a reader. But this is... this is a big moment. This is... beyond... historic.Where were you...? We came upon your herd... we got lucky. But I was surprised. You weren't with them.I hope you don't come to regret sparing his life. He's quite a good shot.Have you finally come to save your apes?I see... I kill somebody close to you that night...?I'm sorry. I was there to kill you.My God, look at your eyes... they're almost human... How did you know I was here?Joining me...?Who told you that?Ok, let's go.Any more trouble tonight?You could use a haircut there, son. You too, soldier....Ok. Back to work.Please. Tell them to work.Tell them.Five... Four...Three... Two...String him up, donkey.Interfere with the work again, and I'll begin slaughtering the apes, one by one. Understand? I need that wall.They'll get food and water when they finish the work.You know you're very emotional. What makes you think you're in a position to make demands?I was told you were smart, but... that's impressive.No. They won't be joining me.They... fear me.Jesus Christ... you are impressive.Well, you paint quite a picture. What you must think of me.You came here to kill me. Were you going to show me mercy?Mercy. Do you have any idea what your mercy would do to us?You're much stronger than we are. And you're smart as hell. No matter what you say, you'd eventually replace us, that's the law of Nature. The irony is, we created you. We tried to defy Nature, bend it to our will. And Nature's been punishing us for our arrogance ever since. Testing us. Even now.Ten months ago, we sent out recon units to look for your base. They found nothing. My own son was a soldier with one of the groups. One day he suddenly stopped speaking. He became... primitive. Like an animal. They contacted me, said they thought he lost his mind, that the war was too much for him. But then the man caring for him stopped speaking too. Their medic had a theory, before he stopped speaking. That the virus that almost wiped us out -- the virus every human survivor still carries \u00ad- had suddenly changed... Mutated.And if it spread, it would destroy humanity for good this time. Not by killing us... but by robbing us of the things that make us human. Our speech, our higher thinking... It would turn us into beasts... not unlike what you all used to be. You talk about mercy...? What would you have done?Well, it was a moment of clarity for me. I realized I would have to sacrifice my only son, so that humanity could be saved. I held that gun in my hand, and I pointed it at my only child. He looked at me with trust in his eyes, all he had left in his primitive gaze. And I pulled the trigger. It purified me. It made my purpose clear.I gave orders to kill the other infected, all of them, and anyone who might've been in direct contact, even if they showed no symptoms. We burned their belongings, anything that might spread contamination. Some of the men questioned my judgment. I was asking them to do what I had done: to sacrifice their families... their friends. They refused. So I had them killed too. Others with children deserted into the woods. One of those cowards fled to my superiors up north. They sent officers down to restrain me. They tried to convince me this plague could be dealt with medically, that up there they were already looking for a cure. That's when I realized: they had learned nothing from our past.What did I do, Preacher?Except for the one I spared, so he could return to deliver a message: if they wanted to relieve me of my command, they'd have to meet me here, and do it themselves.This place used to be a weapons depot. They turned it into a relocation camp when the crisis was just beginning. But the weapons are all still here, inside that mountain. This is a holy war. All of human history has led to this moment. And if we lose, we'll be the last of our kind. It will be a planet of apes. And we'll become your cattle.Look at you. You think I'm sick, don't you.Probably all of them. Don't get any ideas -- only thing they fear more than me is you apes. They never questioned my methods when it came to you.I didn't mean to kill your son...But if his destiny was to inherit your unholy kingdom... then I'm glad I did.So emotional!I can see how conflicted you are. You're confused in your purpose. You're angry at me because of something I did that was an act of war. But you're taking this all much too personally.What do you think my men would've done to your apes... if you had killed me?Or is killing me more important...?If he's still alive in the morning, he goes back to work or you shoot him. Keep him separate from the others.How many are out there? Are there others?Sweep the area. Put him in the pen.For two years we've fought relentlessly against these beasts, and when we are done with them, we will bring an end to their kind. But now we find ourselves on the eve of battle... against our own kind. So you may ask: who is the real enemy, who are we fighting here? And I'll tell you. It's not the apes. It's not the men who are on their way here right now to altercate with us. The battle we've been waging all this time is against ourselves.They say we are inhumane. Indecent. They call us a death squad. But they'll never understand the extent of our sacrifice. How agonizing it has been to do what must be done, even as it tears at our very souls. Because there are times when you must abandon your humanity in the fight to save humanity. All of you have shown the courage to do that... But now we must take that fight to them, or this hellish trial will all have been in vain. We can not fail. We're the last defense. Somewhere in this world there are more survivors. And whether they know it or not, they are counting on us. To show the will to protect them against this new plague. We've seen it here. And it's already spreading up north. If we lose this battle, there'll be nothing to stop it from spreading everywhere. If we lose, in a matter of months, the human race will gasp its last words, and go silent. Just another dumb animal, left to roam a godforsaken world.Most of you are still young men and women. And if we win, years from now, you may be sitting somewhere with your children, your grandchildren... and they'll ask you: what did you do in the greatest war...? And you can tell them, you fought... viciously... for a gentler world.Send him up to the quarry. Alone.Boyle! His cuffs.What is this...?How did this get in there?Get him to work.Least you can take comfort... Your struggle ends... Ours goes on... Nature still has the power to wipe us off this planet at any moment... Killed the dinosaurs with a single meteor.You apes are so strong... I wonder... what kind of world you would have built... on our graves.You know when I first got to the city... a man said he had to see me. He said he knew you. That you worked together.I think that was his name, yes.He said you were remarkable. More than just an animal...you were a great leader. I thought he was crazy... But I almost see what he meant. He pleaded with me to find you. To make peace with you.I shot him.What's going on here?", "clean_line": "soldier need position command understand soldier kill target acquired repeat target got let grant lee wellington napoleon custer sitting bull probably reader big moment historic came herd got lucky surprised weren hope come regret sparing life good shot finally come save apes kill somebody close night sorry kill god look eyes human know joining told ok let trouble tonight use haircut son soldier ok work tell work tell string donkey interfere work ll begin slaughtering apes understand need wall ll food water finish work know emotional makes think position demands told smart impressive won joining fear jesus christ impressive paint picture think came kill going mercy mercy idea mercy stronger smart hell matter eventually replace law nature irony created tried defy nature bend nature punishing arrogance testing months ago sent recon units look base son soldier groups day suddenly stopped speaking primitive like animal contacted said thought lost mind war man caring stopped speaking medic theory stopped speaking virus wiped virus human survivor carries suddenly changed mutated spread destroy humanity good time killing robbing things human speech higher thinking turn beasts unlike talk mercy moment clarity realized sacrifice son humanity saved held gun hand pointed child looked trust eyes left primitive gaze pulled trigger purified purpose clear gave orders kill infected ve direct contact showed symptoms burned belongings spread contamination men questioned judgment asking sacrifice families friends refused killed children deserted woods cowards fled superiors north sent officers restrain tried convince plague dealt medically looking cure realized learned past preacher spared return deliver message wanted relieve command meet place weapons depot turned relocation camp crisis beginning weapons inside mountain holy war human history led moment lose ll kind planet apes ll cattle look think sick probably ideas thing fear apes questioned methods came mean kill son destiny inherit unholy kingdom glad emotional conflicted confused purpose angry act war taking personally think men ve apes killed killing important alive morning goes work shoot separate sweep area pen years ve fought relentlessly beasts bring end kind eve battle kind ask real enemy fighting ll tell apes men way right altercate battle ve waging time inhumane indecent death squad ll understand extent sacrifice agonizing tears souls times abandon humanity fight save humanity shown courage fight hellish trial vain fail defense world survivors know counting protect new plague ve seen spreading north lose battle ll stop spreading lose matter months human race gasp words silent dumb animal left roam godforsaken world young men women win years sitting children grandchildren ll ask greatest war tell fought viciously gentler world send quarry boyle cuffs work comfort struggle ends goes nature power wipe planet moment killed dinosaurs single meteor apes strong wonder kind world built graves know got city man said said knew worked think yes said remarkable animal great leader thought crazy meant pleaded peace shot going"}, "CAESAR": {"raw_line": "I... did not start this war.The ape who did... is dead. His name was Koba. I killed him. I only fight now... to protect apes.I know these apes. They followed Koba... They tried to kill me. They fear what I will do to them. They believe I cannot forgive. So now they serve you... just to survive.[Get him out of here.]Tell your Colonel... you have seen me now. And I have a message for him: this fighting can stop. Leave us the woods. And no more humans will die.They are the message. I showed them mercy. He will see we are not savages. Let's hope this works. They are getting closer...Why didn't I see, Maurice?That Koba could not forgive what humans did to him when he was their prisoner. That he would seek revenge. I should have known.Welcome home, Rocket. You look tired.Come inside!Yes... We must still find a way to get out of the woods safely.There were two of you. But we are many.I know, son. More apes die everyday. And we cannot hide here much longer.We will find a way out...Apes together strong.[I am so proud of you.] [I love you, son.][Stay here.

The soldiers will be back soon.When I find him, the soldiers will all come after me. That may give you the best chance to get out of the woods. Until then, be safe.No.I might not make it back.Look around. Take what we can use.Come.We cannot take her.Looks like some were killed here.Winter...Where is the Colonel?...Gone?What border? Why?My son... my wife... are dead....Koba?[Is that them up ahead?][Don't let them see us!]I don't know...What is that...?Why... did they shoot you?Help me get him up...Winter said they were heading to a border...!Are you... alone here?You... live here?Are there more like you? More apes? From zoo?You learn to speak...?Where did you get this?Bad humans...? Soldiers?Is it far? Can you take us?Please. You must take us.I don't know.She has no one else.I had two. But one was killed. By human.I don't know... Maybe.[Luca, let's take a closer look.] [Stay here. Keep them safe.]I don't know...Don't see riders...They must pay......Koba? You know nothing. My wife and son were killed. And now my friend. You call me Koba...?!I did not ask you to come. Any of you. This is my fight. I will finish it alone... Go now. Join the others.What happened?Use you...?What... kind of work...?Wait -- my little son -- is he here...?I... didn't know they were here. I came for you.My... family.I was told you were coming... That others would be joining you here.To finish us off... for good.I will find some way to get us out of here. I promise...[Why do they need a wall...?]LEAVE HIM!!!Apes need food. Water.Give them food and wat--What did the Colonel promise you? You really think he will let you live... after we are gone?No matter what you do... you'll never be one of them. You let them call you \"donkey\"... You are ape.Apes... need food... water.Give them food and water... or they will not be able to finish.The soldiers who are coming here... are not coming to join you, are they?I saw men outside by the wall... preparing for battle...They are against you?Why...?Because you kill your own men?We found bodies. Something wrong... with these men.I think... you have no mercy.I showed you mercy... when I spared your men. I offered you peace. And you killed my family.You killed them too...?How many... will be coming?If this battle is coming... you should leave, while you still can.You are not like him.[Do not lose hope... Some way, somehow, we will finish the journey to our new home. I will find a way to get us out of here.]Koba...No...[37 steps to the adult cage... 55 to the children.]His wall is madness. It won't save him... any more than it will save you.Is there anything left... of you to save?[We must leave tonight!][We'll have to get the children out above ground!]...Malcolm?He... was a friend.What... happened to this man?[Wait till he turns out his lights.][We go now. Or die trying.]I love you, son...By the time the sun rises, you'll all be on your way... to a new home. Hurry, you must go.Maurice was right. I am like Koba. He could not escape his hate...
