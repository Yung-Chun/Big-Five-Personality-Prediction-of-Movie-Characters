{"Analyze-That": {"VITTI": {"raw_line": "Garbage. Change the channel.I'm going to bed. Vitti stands up and heads back to his cell.What's goin' on, Earl?Why?Yeah. Take it easy. He notices something in the box.Hey, Earl. Is that my after-shave?That's okay. Keep it. Go ahead.Guess who, you fuck! INTERCUT WITH:Not a good time? Let me explain something to you. I'm in fucking Hell right now. This is not a good time.So what does that have to do with me?Don't hang up on, Sobel! They're tryin' to kill me!He stands there for a long beat just staring, the DIAL TONE BUZZING in his ear. CUT TO: INT. SING SING - MESS HALL - NEXT DAY'When you're a Jet, You're a Jet all the way, From your first cigarette To your last dyin' day...' Prisoners and guards stare at him like he's nuts. Coyote stabs at him again, but Vitti dodges and smashes him over the head with the tray.'When you're a Jet, If the shit hits the fan, You got brothers around, You're a family man...''I like to be in America, Okay by me in America...' The guards drag him down and cuff his hands behind him, then carry him out stiff as a board.'Tonight, tonight, won't be just any night -- ' DISSOLVE TO: EXT. SOBEL HOUSE - LATER A limo pulls up to an old, but well-maintained suburban house, the family gets out and starts walking to the house.'I feel pretty, oh, so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright...''Who's the pretty girl in the mirrorTony?The rumble -- it's tonight! I have to get out of here. I don't want to die. No, Chino, no! Vitti's jaw suddenly goes slack and he slumps in his seat, staring forward.'Boy, boy, crazy boy, keep cool, boy! Got a rocket in your pocket, keep cool-y cool boy -- ' CUT TO: INT. SING SING - CONSULTATION ROOM - NEXT DAY Vitti is sitting at a table facing Ben. Dr. Cutler observes from a chair in the corner.Mommy's mad at me because I made a boom on the rug.I see you. I see him. I see a table.It looks like snow.A bat. A big bat. Or a weasel.And he's got a little girl -- no, it's a little boy -- in his teeth -- and he's shakin' him and shakin' him 'cause the kid didn't wipe himself good -- and the kid is screaming because the bat-weasel ripped out his throat and the blood is shootin' out of his neck vein. That's the blood. Doctor Cutler looks worried.Just the pussy with the teeth.3-2-1.Blue. CUT TO:This is a picture of a guy -- nice, hardworking guy -- comes home and finds out his wife's been screwin' this midget while he was out of town.I think he works over the midget for a while, then he blows 'em away.Trick question, right? Both of 'em. CUT TO: ANOTHER TESTYes.I did. I said 'yes.'-- whenever.You fucking son-of-a-bitch! Where the fuck do you get off sticking me with a needle?Took you long enough. I was singin' West Side Story for three fuckin' days. I'm half a fag already.I call you to say somebody's trying to kill me and you hang up on me?You're my fuckin' doctor!Me me me me! He's dead! Get over it.I'm deeply sorry for your loss.What's the difference? You hated him anyway.I'm not sensing it, but if you say so. Ben nervously pops a pill and swallows it.What's that?I don't know -- take your pick. Could be my old family, or could be the Rigazzis. Ever heard of Lou Rigazzi - - Lou 'The Wrench'?Because he twisted a guy's head off once.Off. Fuckin' Calabrese -- animals. And comin' from me you know that's a big compliment.The feds are really putting the pressure on. The families are fighting each other again -- what's left of 'em. It's the fall of the fuckin' Roman Empire. It's World War Three out there.They knew I was gettin' out soon and the last thing anybody wants to see is me getting into it on either side.Yeah, they'll probably want to throw me a party and give me a gold watch. Trust me -- nobody's lookin' forward to me being out.Me? Oh, yeah, my future looks real fuckin' rosy. Ben can't believe what he's gotten himself into. CUT TO: EXT. SOBEL HOUSE - LATERI'm not gonna be here that long. Jelly's pickin' me up in an hour.Don't worry about it. I'll call you tomorrow.What are you, my father now?I'm comin'. Some fuckin' life this is gonna be. He follows Ben up the stairs. CUT TO: INT. U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - LATER Chapin is conferring with another U.S. ATTORNEY, DAVIS, and Agents Miller and Cerrone.Coffee?Somebody said something about coffee.So what's the holdup?I understand. She's uncomfortable. The whole situation's a little awkward with me bein' here -- but let's face it, Emily fuckin' Post she's not.Listen, I got a friend coming over. I didn't want you to be surprised.Not that kind of friend. It's a personal thing.Are you really that pussy-whipped?I heard her busting your balls.Or?Or you're pussy-whipped.Good night, Whippy.Oh, really? I didn't hear you the tenth fuckin' time. He exits. CUT TO: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER Ben knocks on Michael's door and walks in without waiting to be asked. CUT TO: INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION Michael is sitting up in bed reading.What?So let him get his own fuckin' girl.Actually, I'm right in the middle of someone. Sheila starts to light a cigarette.Minding my own fuckin' business, like you should be doin'.I've been in prison for two and a half years. What am I supposed to do?That's what I wanted to do, but you told me I had no choice -- it was either here or Sing Sing.Yeah, that's what I've been jerkin' off about for eight hundred consecutive nights -- a nice home- cooked meal. Ohhhh, tuna casserole.I think you're jealous.I didn't hear nothin' comin' out of your room.Hey, if you're really quiet, you might be able to do it without even wakin' up your wife.I told her if I wasn't back in two minutes to start without me. I gotta go. Vitti heads back upstairs.Go ahead! Get out of here, you crazy fuckin' whore. Vitti charges into the room, his robe open. From the reactions of everyone in the room, it's clear he's not wearing anything under it.Go back to turning tricks in Jersey for all I fuckin' care. Sheila exits and slams the front door. Vitti sees everyone staring at him. He closes his robe.How's it goin'? Oh, we got food. Good. Vitti heads for the buffet.Oh, great. Jew food. Who do you have to fuck to get some bacon around here? The woman reacts in horror.Not you, I'm guessing.What is it with your relatives? They tend to overreact quite a bit.So? From the look of 'em, some of those broads haven't seen the old salcicc' in a long time. It's good for them.What do you mean?First I'm gonna find out who's tryin' to kill me. I'm a target. Somebody could shoot right through that window -- blow my fuckin' head off. Ben sees that he's in the line of fire, gets up and moves out of the way.Yeah. I'm too big for a jockey so I was thinkin' maybe a hairdresser. They'll call me Mr. Paul.I like hitting a guy on the head with a baseball bat.Shylocking, bookmaking, unions, the usual --Who am I? I'm the guy who's paying you $150 an hour to play these stupid fuckin' games. You know who I am.What do you mean, 'What am I?'You're making me very fuckin' nervous.I'm the boss.You, you're good. I see what you're doing here.You're pissing me off is what you're doing. Look at me. It's starting again, the anxiety.I don't know. Who remembers that stuff?No.No.No.Yeah, maybe. What did you want to be?I am.You wanted to look up people's assholes all day?You must've been a lot of laughs when you were a kid. Lonely, huh?It's stupid.Yeah, I'm afraid.Okay. When I was really little -- like seven or eight -- maybe I wanted to be a cowboy.Yeah. My father gave me a cowboy suit -- you know, the vest, the chaps, the cap guns -- the whole thing. And he used to take me up to my uncle's farm in New Jersey and lead me around on this pony. Yippee-i-o. You happy now?Everybody. The whole family. My father loved 'Gunsmoke.'Marshal Dillon.This is so fuckin' retarded.All right. Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, the Lone Ranger --Yeah, I guess.Yeah, so?I don't know. Nothing happened.I lived in East Harlem! I joined a street gang when I was 12 and that was it.What?The Dodgers moved from Brooklyn to L.A. Everybody took it pretty hard.We playin' a guessing game here?Do I remember? I think about it every fuckin' day of my life. What's that got to do with it?Yeah. He did.He always said he wanted me to go to college. I didn't even finish high school. He really starts sobbing now.Okay. Okay. That's enough of that shit.Yeah, just sprinkle some fuckin' fairy dust on me.You mean working for somebody? I'm supposed to take orders from some guy who used to get me coffee? (starts sweating andI got stuff to do.Calm down. I'll be back.Oh, yeah? Watch me. Drive, Jelly.Stop sweating, Doc. I'll be back. Vitti puts the window up.No, I'm okay. It was an act. I had to pretend I was nuts. There were people watching me all the time.Doctors. They never woulda let me out if they thought I was normal.You want to see crazy? Just tell me who's trying to kill me. I'll show you crazy.I can't do it, Sal. I'm out of it.Sal, even if I wanted to -- the fedsI know.Yeah, I do too.Yeah, okay, I'll think about it.I can't, Sal. I gotta go talk to the boss.'Yeah, what?' That's how you answer the door?Yeah. Vitti punches Eddie in the mouth, sending him sprawling back into the living room. Several other bodyguards are watching television, caught off guard by Vitti's sudden entrance.Where is she?How's it goin', Patty?Sorry to hear about Carmine. He was a good man.I'll bet -- especially with all the talk about you being the one who put him there.Yeah, I'm sure you're very busy.You even go near them, you crazy bitchYeah, I been workin' out who's tryingSo then you didn't have nothin' to do with it.Thanks. I gotta see a guy about a business thing.No, this is a legitimate business.I just want to be left alone. Put my life back together -- straight up this time. Put the word out, will ya? Nobody's got nothin' to worry about from me.Look at the size of that trunk. You could fit three people in there. Not people -- suitcases. It's a joke.So what are you driving now? MR. MacINERNY We have a Lexus.It's a fancy Toyota, right? The Japs make good cars, but I ain't that quick to forget Pearl Harbor. The MacInernys look doubtful. CUT TO: INT. MORETTI'S STEAK HOUSE - NIGHT A crowd of well-heeled New Yorkers surround Vitti at the captain's station. Vitti, the new host, greets a prominent sports figure who embraces him like an old friend.Mario, put Mr. Torre at table five. JOEY BOOTS, an old acquaintance of Vitti's, enters with a couple of his cronies.Hey, Joey.Yeah.Nah -- not really. It's like -- I'm on parole, so I just -- I come in, I greet people.You want more bread? He takes a small loaf from the breadbasket on the next table, stuffs it into the Businessman's mouth and walks off.I'll get your drinks now.Fluorescent light. Makes everything look yellow. He starts instinctively casing the store. QUICK CUT TO: ARMED SECURITY GUARDWhat?I'm gonna do us both a big favor. I quit. CUT BACK TO: INT. CAR DEALERSHIP - DAY The MacInernys are trembling.You want to see the manager? Here's the manager. Now take a hike, you fuckin' deadbeats. The MacInernys rush out of the showroom.Get a Hyundai! CUT TO:I can't deal with this shit. My grades suck, I'm gettin' in fights every day, and if I get suspended again my mother's gonna fuckin' kill me -- if the nuns don't kill me first.What? VITTI'S MOTHER is sitting next to him.Ma? What are you doin' here?leaps to his feet and reaches for his gun, but instead pulls out a long sword. Confused but desperate, he holds up the sword to menace the intruders, but the sword suddenly goes limp. He tries to make the blade stand up, but it just keeps dropping like a piece of soft rope. Patty, Eddie, and the thugs laugh contemptuously at Vitti, while Jelly looks on with an incredible stream of tears pouring from his eyes.Really? Do me a favor, honey -- make me a sandwich.Coulda had that sandwich made by now.Okay.Hey! Me, too.Ham, cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, no onion.Where am I going? The orphanage found my real parents. They want me back. Put those in the car. I'm goin' to Jelly's. Jelly carries the luggage to his car parked in the driveway.For what? The more we talk the worse I get. I had that dream again.No, the other one.So don't!I know what you're thinkin'. The sword is my cock and I can't get it up, but that ain't it. I saw Sheila last night and I had a hard-on you could swing from.You coulda hung wet towels on it.Wait in the car! So what does it mean? Ben sits on the wicker divan.Doc -- nothing's gonna fit. That nine-to-five bullshit -- I'll fuckin' kill myself if I have to do that for the rest of my life. You know they take taxes out of your check? What the fuck is that? I'm doomed. I'm gonna end up selling hot dogs on the street. Look at me. I'm havin' a fuckin' panic attack here. My heart's beatin' like a rabbit.This is your fault.Tellin' me I have to get a job like I'm some fuckin' nobody. It was humiliating! Thanks a lot.What the hell was that?Now what are you takin'?Yeah, I know it.For what?No. We gettin' any real food? This is like eatin' fuckin' bait. Raoul chuckles and glances uncomfortably at his girlfriend. Ben laughs loudly to cover the awkward moment. He's suffering from some reaction between the pills and the booze and he's oddly thick-lipped.Why you talkin' like that?Like a fuckin' retard.You wanna shut the fuck up?Don't admire me too much.In two seconds I'm gonna put a fork in your eye.Yeah, sure, whatever.That's her claim to fame. I hate to bust your bubble, but he's not from Bensonhurst. He's a professional Italian. He grew up in Connecticut or something like that.What's the matter with you? We got women at the table.That's different. It's colorful.So. I see in the paper where Oklahoma! might win the Tony award.Down!!! He grabs Sheila and pulls her down as GUNFIRE rakes the wall behind them. Everybody else at the table hits the floor. Other diners scream in terror. Jelly pulls a GUN and SHOOTS back.I think somebody's got it in for Raoul.I'm gonna ask you once nicely. Who you working for?Fuck me? Fine. Jelly? Jelly shoves the guy to the parapet at the edge of the roof, grabs him by the legs and hangs him over the side of the building. The guy screams.I'll ask you again. Who you working for? The guy keeps screaming.Who are you working for?Drop him, Jelly.Pull him back up.What's the matter with you?I said pull him back up.You heard what you wanted to hear.Yeah, this is real authentic.I know who he is. They used to watch the show up at Sing Sing.Mate? I don't believe this! You're an English guy? You ain't even Italian.Down under what?I wouldn't wet my pants over it. They watch 'Supermarket Sweep,' too. Raoul laughs hard.You laugh too much.Yeah. You got a good setup here.Coupla things, though. I don't know who makes these decisions, but some of this, it don't look right.The people mainly. I mean, you got a boss who speaks Australian. What the fuck is that? And I'm guessing yourYeah, the theater. So how about if I bring in some guys that I know -- you know, more 'authentic.'Yeah. One of those trailers like the stars have.No fuckin' way. I've had it with this job bullshit. A week of this and I'd either shoot myself or shoot Raoul. But it's good cover while I figure out my next move. Call the guys.Yeah, ten minutes, tell 'em. Eddie Devol, Patty LoPresti's guy, watches Vitti from a safe distance. CUT TO: EXT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY Ben comes out of the market carrying several grocery bags and a small prescription bag. Two Mafia SOLDIERS step up beside him and urge him toward a big stretch LIMO IDLING at the curb.We're gonna need a grapple or a crane with maybe a fifty-foot boom.See what you can come up with. And we're gonna need a city bus.How you doin', Patty.One of Rigazzi's guys took a shot at me. She stops at the extras' makeup table and starts primping in the mirror.Yeah, I know. When you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way.Nothing's going on. They're actors.Okay. Something big is going down, but you're getting a cut. My hand to God.I don't think so.Whatever. Raoul approaches and eyes Patty disdainfully.Raoul, this is a friend of mine. Patty LoPresti. Raoul freezes, recognizing the name.No, you're fine. But you might want to have somebody else start your car the next couple of weeks.This is Lou Rigazzi.This way. CUT TO: EXT. CRAFT SERVICES TABLE - MOMENTS LATER Vitti and Rigazzi stand at the table. Rigazzi's soldiers are nearby.Is that right?Me? No.Thanks. I'll sleep much better.I don't think so.Hey, Doc. What are you doing here?Patty who?Who says I'm lying? I finally get a straight job and start putting my life in order and you come in here and start accusing me! That's how much you trust me?This is what's so hard about being an ex-con. You make one little mistake in your life and people never let you forget it.Wait a second. Say that again.'I want the truth.' Say it -- like you did just now.No, strong, like before.Yeah, that's good!No, I'm serious. That had power. I believed it. You could be an actor.Hey, you're as good as most of the bums I see around here. They have this part. You could do it.Of course. I'm gonna talk to Raoul.No, this part you could do. It's perfect. Believe me. CUT TO: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY The camera rolls.Oh, yeah. That sounds real. CUT TO:Hey, if you didn't want to do it, why didn't you say something?Come on -- you were great.What, are you self-medicating again? And don't give that decongestant multi-vitamin bullshit.I'm gonna say that's none of his fuckin' business.You recognize that car?The one that's been following us the last mile and a half. Ben jerks his head around to look and sees a black Mercedes behind him.Lose 'em.No, they're two cars back. You gotta be a little more observant, Doc. Turn left. Ben executes a hard, SKIDDING left. The Benz stays right with him.Broad daylight's the best time. You can see better. Take a right. Now!Move over. I'll drive.Backseat. Now! Ben tries to launch himself into the backseat but is stopped by his seat belt.Hang on.What the fuck are you doing?Throw it! Bent throws the paper out the window.Yeah, that's James Bond and the 'Sea Hunt' guy in there, so they got a pretty good shot. They hear POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING. Vitti starts walking away quickly. Ben follows after him.I gotta take care of something.Send my regrets.So long, Doc. Vitti takes off running, ducking behind the rows of parked cars.I don't have a lot of time. They're probably gonna come lookin' for me, so we'll go over everything later, okay?Look, I'm not happy about it, but if it keeps Patty off my back, so be it. They're meeting us at the club. Let's head out. Not all at once. I gotta tell you everything? A PRODUCTION ASSISTANT KNOCKS and sticks her head in the door.No, I gotta go.I'll talk to him tomorrow. He hands the P.A. some money.Here -- tell him you couldn't find me. Vitti exits. The P.A. looks at the money. CUT TO: EXT. MAKEUP TRAILER - LATER Vitti makes his way past the trailers, heading for his car. As he passes the makeup trailer, the door opens and Tony Bella sticks his head out.Can't really talk right now, mate. Headin' out.Try kickin' something. Let me know how it works out. Vitti starts for the door.I don't know. You could kick a guy in the face.Just some guy! You knock him down, give him a couple quick kicks in the head while he's on the ground.Why not? Because he's there and you're pissed off.Maybe once or twice. Look, I got people waiting.I don't know. You could yell real loud?Or keep your fuckin' mouth shut! Who gives a shit what you do, for cryin' out loud? Tony Bella likes something about Vitti's inflection.What are you doin'?Okay, you can cut that shit out right now.Hey, I'm serious, asshole!What are you doing here?What's it look like? We're just blowin' off a little steam. What's the big deal?Al Pacino? That's your real name?Anybody ever call you Carol Burnett?'Cause you look about as much like Carol Burnett as you look like Al Pacino. Ben laughs. Al Pacino glares at him.You better get out of here.Don't make me hurt you. Get the fuck out of here. He walks away leaving Ben frozen. Ben watches as they disappear through a door leading to the back of the club. He starts toward the door. CUT TO: INT. BASEMENT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Vitti is seated at a big table in the crowded, smoke-filled room. Jelly sits at his side. He's surrounded by his crew, about a half-a-dozen guys, and Patty's man, Eddie DeVol. Several street maps and diagrams are spread out on the table.Okay, this is big and we only get one shot at it; and there's only about a million ways this fuckin' thing can go bad, so listen up. Vitti pulls a street map to the center of the table and taps a spot downtown.The Federal Gold Depository in Lower Manhattan. Three times a year a shipment of gold bars goes in a heavily-guarded armored truck from the Depository to the vault at the Federal Reserve to hold for foreign governments that trade in bullion. At three o'clock in the morning -- eight hours from now --we're gonna hijack that truck. CUT TO: INT. LITTLE DARLING'S - SAME TIME Ben enters the back room of the club, looks around, and starts down the stairwell leading to the basement.What are you doing?Get your fuckin' hands off him! He's with me.He's in. He's my responsibility.Okay -- everybody listen up.Check the bus. Jelly exits.If we can, I'm gonna get you out before the real shit goes down. Just don't flip out on me, okay?You said it yourself. It's my nature.What are you, fucking Jiminy Cricket? I don't know what planet you live on, but here on Earth it's 'might makes right.' Read the papers. The guys with the guns make the rules.Enough. Say one more word about my father and I'll break your fuckin' head.I have five to three. They should start movin' any minute.Let's see your watch.He can hear the convoy passing outside the wall.sees the signal.Go! CUT TO: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION A forty-foot, flat-bed trailer truck loaded with cement conduit backs across the street and stops, blocking the path of the convoy. The lead SUV HONKS. The truck doesn't move. The CAPTAIN of the marshals gets out and walks up to the truck. The driver has slipped out the other side and disappeared. Suddenly, a huge steel claw drops down from above and closes around the top of the armored truck, its sharp points crunching into the metal sides. Then the truck starts rising off the pavement. A couple of determined marshals jump out of their vehicles, race over and grab onto the bumpers as the armored truck is lifted off the ground. CUT TO: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS ACTION A hundred-foot tower crane lifts the truck straight up. The marshals hang on as long as they can, then prudently let go and drop heavily to the street. Two marshals are still clinging to the truck as it rises to a height of thirty feet, then swings silently over the perimeter fencing.Let's go. He strides off to take charge. Ben pulls down his mask and hurries after him, but runs right into a pole.Totally in charge, he strides up to the armored truck just as his men finish cutting through the steel plate doors. Vitti yanks the doors open.. Vitti and Ben stare in awe at the exposed contents of the truck -- a fortune in gold bars.Get the ramp! Eddie and his guys run up with a long, narrow track with metal rollers and set it up at the rear of the gold truck.Forty bars. That's all we need.$350 an ounce, 16 ounces in a pound, 90 pounds in each bar -- do the math.Yeah?Don't do this. Vitti drags him off toward the building structure.Calm down.You're not gonna die!For Chrissake, get hold of yourself!Yeah. Feel better now?You were good. It isn't your fault.Would you just shut up about your father!He was an asshole -- you said it yourself. What are you grieving for?Jeez, I'm sorry.We don't have time for this.I'm warning you -- don't do this --There I go. You happy now? You see what you're doing here? Both men are crying now.I loved him, too. I did.I had my hopes.That's what Patty thought, too. This scumbag's been playin' both sides against the middle.Yeah, what?I felt worse.Those are my choices? What happened to lying on a beach in Costa Rica for the next twenty years? You can't let me enjoy this for five fuckin' minutes?And then what? I'll show you. CUT TO: EXT. RIGAZZI PLUMBING AND HEATING - NEXT MORNING A Rigazzi company van is forced open by a team of FBI agents led by Agent Miller. Stacked inside are forty gold bars. Agent Cerrone comes out of the building with Lou Rigazzi and several associates in handcuffs. U.S. Attorney Chapin makes a statement to the media.Not so good.Yeah, I know.I told you -- I just want to be leftCan't do that.Yeah.What kind of question is that? She's cool. She's just happy to have 'the Wrench' out of the way.Did he grab your balls?I'm gonna go to Ohio -- get Marie and the kids -- then we'll probably disappear for awhile -- figure out allYeah, you, too. You hung in there. That took a lot of guts.No, you were like an animal back there.No. I'm telling you. You're a monster. I saw the beast in you.Handle yourself? You were fuckin' John Wayne.Yeah, I could tell. You're good, you.Paul, I just --No. You are good. You got a gift, my friend. Ben gives up.So -- happy ending, huh?Are you kidding? I feel like shit.

feel like shit work million bucks easy doc hey doc place"}, "BEN": {"raw_line": "It's very difficult for me to talk about my father, because in a sense I'm talking about two men.One, of course, is the public Isaac Sobel, the eminent psychotherapist and popular author known to millions of readers around the world. Laura, Michael and Ben's Mother listen proudly to the eulogy.The second Isaac Sobel is the private man -- my father -- Dad. And for those of you who knew him well and knew our family -- well, let's face it -- my father was a psychotic, mind- fucking prick. An arrogant, abusive, ego-inflated -- A RINGING CELL PHONE interrupts him. JUMP CUT TO: BENHello? The mourners mutter.Paul? I have to, uh, take this. This isn't a good time. Vitti is disheveled, his hair messed, his shirt buttoned wrong.I can't talk right now. My father died!Call me later --I can't believe he's gone.Okay, I might have strayed from my notes a little. I'm dealing with a lot of stuff here. Grief is a process. Laura notices FBI AGENTS CERRONE and MILLER waiting for them in the living room. Cerrone is an attractive woman in her late twenties, wearing a dangerously-short skirt. Miller is a clean-cut man in his thirties.Thank you, I'm going to miss himI mean -- there were issues -- as, I think, there are with any father and son. He wasn't especially warm --No, I'm just saying, in spite of all that -- Agent Cerrone crosses her legs, a move that does not go unnoticed by Ben and Michael.-- he was a great, great legs. Man.What makes you think Paul Vitti called me?Then yes. He did.Yes.Michael?She's with the F.B.I. She needs to know these things.Did I say that?No, we're fine.She's grieving. It's a process.Oh, yes. Paul Vitti and I were involved in some organized crime activity a couple of years ago. I mean, I wasn't involved -- not 'involved' involved -- I was just trying to help him therapeutically, and some people tried to, uh, kill us. No big deal.What kind of breakdown?That would keep a parade pretty calm. He just keeps singing West Side Story songs? DR. CUTLER 'Tonight,' 'Maria,' the balcony scene.The balcony scene? Both parts? DR. CUTLER Oh, yeah. Get him to do 'Officer Krupke.' It's really good.Paul, it's me. Ben Sobel. Paul? Maria?Oh, boy. What's going on, Maria?Paul? Paul? Ben waves a hand in front of Vitti's face. Nothing. DR. CUTLER This is how it's been. He sings for a while, then he goes completely catatonic.Really. Can we take him to an examining room? DR. CUTLER Of course. CUT TO: INT. EXAMINING ROOM - MINUTES LATER Vitti sits inert on the examination table.You already did a neurological work- up? DR. CUTLER Yep. No tumors, no aneurisms, no sign of stroke --Completely catatonic -- He pulls on Vitti's ears and nose. Vitti does not react.Totally gone. Well, I don't think he's smart enough to be faking. Street smart, yes, but we're talking about an I.Q. just north of a bedroom slipper. Ben checks Vitti out of the corner of his eye. No reaction. Then Ben takes a sharp needle from an instrument tray.So if I just stuck him with this needle, he probably wouldn't even respond. DR. CUTLER I don't know. Try it. Ben hesitates for a moment to see if Vitti will crack, thenOkay -- He sticks the needle into Vitti's shoulder.Paul, we're going to give you some tests to assess your mental condition. There's no pressure -- just answer as best you can. Do I have your consent to share the results of these tests?I'll take that as a yes. Okay, I'm going to show you ten cards, each containing a picture of an inkblot. I want you to look at each card and tell me what you see.Focus, Paul. You haven't seen the card yet. What does this look like to you? Take your time. Vitti looks at the wrong side of the card. It's all white.No, Paul, the other side. Vitti turns it over and makes a face.Bat or weasel. All right.See anything else?Pussy with teeth. Next card.Try again. 7-3-8.Just tell me what you think is going on in this picture.Screwing a midget. And how does the story end?The wife or the midget?Okay, Paul. Last test. In this one, I'm going to start a sentence and you complete it any way you want to. Ready? 'I get angry -- 'No, you're supposed to complete the sentence.I wasn't asking if you agreed or disagreed; it was more like, 'I get angry when -- 'Well, that about does it for me. CUT TO: INT. U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY Ben meets with RICHARD CHAPIN, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.Based on his symptoms and the test results, I'd say brief psychotic disorder -- if it persists, possibly schizophreniform disorder. And Dr. Cutler agrees with my diagnosis.Dr. Cutler? No, he's annoying, but --Not crazy. At least not permanently. In certain people, continuous exposure to an extremely stressful situation -- soldiers in combat, for instance, disaster victims, a hostage situation, or being locked up in a maximum security prison with someone trying to kill you -- it can produce a temporary psychotic state.A day, a week, up to a month -- if the precipitating stressors are removed.He could get worse. He could deteriorate to the point where he'd be permanently schizophrenic.You think they'll let him out?Well, couldn't you release him to a halfway house or some place where he could get some decent treatment? Based on my earlier work with him, I don't think he's dangerous, and I think he was making a real effort to reform himself.Mine? Me? No, this is a bad time for me. My father just died -- and I've got this bulging disc in my neck -- and we're redecorating, which is a total nightmare. I can't --No, of course not.No --What? I can't be an institution.Yes. We're clear.Yes. CUT TO: EXT. SING SING - FEW DAYS LATEROkay, Paul -- this way. Vitti comes out carrying an overnight bag, walking like a zombie. Ben leads him over to the car and opens the door for him. Vitti keeps walking, passing the car.This way, Paul. Over here. Here we go. Ben helps Vitti into the car. One of Vitti's legs is still outside.Leg, Paul. Leg up. Ben lifts Vitti's leg into the car and closes the door. CUT TO: INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER Ben STARTS the CAR and pulls away with Vitti still slumped in his seat. Once out of sight of the prison, Vitti straightens and turns on Ben, suddenly lucid.I knew it! I knew you were faking! You used me to get you out of prison!What are you talking about?I was at the funeral home!My father died!Are you hearing yourself?Yeah, I can see how touched you are.I loved my father. I'm feeling a lot of grief right now.Decongestant. I'm getting over a cold. All right, what's going on? Who's after you?Why \"The Wrench\"?Off?I'm sure they'd be flattered. So --So what does that have to do with you?Maybe if you just explain to them -- that you're out of it now, that you're starting a new life --You are, aren't you?Want to grab your stuff?Paul! I don't think you understand. You're in my custody. I could get in a lot of trouble if you screw up.Oh, no. You want to go back to Sing Sing? Thursday's meatloaf night. I can have you back there in no time. The U.S. Attorney was very clear. You stay with me; therapy every day; you can't leave the area without permission --And you have to get a job as soon as you're well enough, which is now. So are you coming in with me or do I have to make a phone call? Vitti relents and grabs his stuff from the back seat.I didn't have a lot of choice.I told you. He's in my custody. I'm a federal institution.His wife and kids aren't here. They're in Ohio.His life was threatened and he didn't want to endanger his family.Honey, your teeth are fine. I know it's an imposition, but what could I do? I didn't want him here. They -You'll have to forgive her. She's usually a great hostess.Emily fuckin' Post. Well, that explains why she rarely used her middle name.What kind of friend? Because if it's 'The Wrench,' or 'The Power Drill' or any other kind of tool --They won't stay late, will they?I'm not -- this has nothing to do with Laura.We were having a disagreement. A certain amount of conflict is normal in a marriage.Or what?Paul --Remember, this is only temporary.Mike, can we talk for a second?I know the last few weeks have been kind of tough with Grandpa -- dying and everything -- and it might've felt to you like I didn't have time for you or I didn't care about how you feel.Good. Because I want you to know that you can talk to me about stuff and that I can really listen and understand what you're going through.And if I seemed a little hard on Grandpa, it's just that your grandfather was a hard man in a lot of ways. He wanted everything done his way and sometimes I just felt like nothing I ever did was good enough. I don't want it to be that way with us.And you know, at times like this we all might start questioning our own mortality and you might be thinking how devastated you'd be if I died. Right?That's good. Good talk. And I realize it's all a little hectic right now, but this Paul Vitti thing is only temporary, okay?That's not funny. Good night, Michael.This has to be some kind of record, don't you think? It's been like forty minutes.Let them? How much longer can he go? Another twenty minutes, I'm either breaking it up or calling the Guinness Book of Records. The MOANING shifts into low gear, more guttural and bestial.That's not entirely true.I have a 17-year-old son.Can I talk to you, please?Miss? Excuse me. There's no smoking in this house.What do you think you're doing?Well, it's a little hard with the live sex show going on in the guest room.Go to a hotel.I'm not trying to punish you. These aren't my rules, but I have a responsibility here. Besides, I thought you might like a nice home- cooked meal after being in prison that long.That girl is not staying here.Oh, yeah, I'm really jealous.We don't think it's necessary to wake the neighbors every time we have sex.This is not a good start, Paul. CUT TO: INT. DINING AREA - NEXT MORNING Laura and Ben are hosting a brunch for the out-of-town relatives. Laura offers a basket of bagels to a seated, older woman.I'm sorry. Next time I lose a parent, I'll be sure to reserve the guest room. A DOOR SLAMS somewhere, then Sheila storms into the room sobbing, her hair askew, tucking her blouse into her skirt.Paul?Why don't we go to my office? I'll make you a plate. CUT TO: INT. BEN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER Ben and Vitti enter. Vitti still in his robe.I know. All you did was flash everybody in the dining room.Well, when the paramedics revive my Aunt Goldie, I'll be sure to ask her. Sit. Vitti starts for Ben's chair.Ah ah ah! He points Vitti to the sofa and takes his own chair.So what are you going to do, Paul?With your life.Okay, that's a priority. Have you thought about what you're going to do for work?Come on. There must be something you like to do.Oh, sporting goods. We'll check the want ads tomorrow but don't get your hopes up. Anything else?Who are you?I know that. I mean what are you?I just want to know how you see yourself.Just answer the question. What are you?Really? The boss of what -- Jelly? You're not the boss of me. So what are you the boss of?What am I doing, Paul?I understand.You've spent your whole life becoming who you are and now you can't be that anymore -- that's gotta be scary. If you're not Paul Vitti the mob boss, who are you? Vitti is at a loss.Well, let's think. When you were a kid, What did you want to be?You must've wanted to be something when you were little -- fireman?Baseball player?Astronaut?Al Capone?We're not talking about me.Fine. I wanted to be a philatelist.No, Paul, I believe you're thinking of a proctologist. I wanted to collect rare and unusual stamps.Oh yeah. Big time. So what did you want to be?You afraid to tell me?Then tell me. I'm not here to judge you.A cowboy. Really?So you watched cowboy movies and TV shows with your father.Sheriff Dillon.Marshal. So who were your favorite cowboys?Paul!Interesting. They're all good guys.No, that's important. You didn't want to be the bad guy. You wanted to be the hero.So what happened?So why didn't you become a cowboy?Something else happened when you were twelve.Something that made you very sad?Something else.Paul! Your father was murdered! Right in front of you. Remember?It's got everything to do with it. He gave you the cowboy suit. With a white hat. He was in the mob, but he wanted you to be a good guy, didn't he? Vitti starts thinking about his father and starts to weep.He didn't want you in the gang life. He only did it himself so you wouldn't have to. He was trying to buy you a better life than his.Well, Paul, this could be a great opportunity for you. You're right back where you were when you were twelve. You've got some big choices to make. Vitti fights to regain control.It's not shit, Paul. My point is, when you're a child, you think anything is possible. Wouldn't it be great to think like that now?I'm just saying you've got to keep an open mind and explore some new possibilities. Try some different things -- maybe you'll connect with one of them. There's a career counselor I work with. I can call him for you. He may be able to help you find a job.How do you know unless you try? Suddenly one of the WINDOWS behind Vitti SHATTERS. Ben dives for cover. Silence -- then another RAP on the window. Ben looks out and sees JELLY in the back yard, tossing stones at the window.Jelly -- what are you doing here?That's great, Jelly. I'd love to catch up with you -- outside.And you, Jelly -- you look -- Did you get a haircut? I thought you were in prison.How'd you get out?What did he have?That's not an illness.Where are you going?What kind of stuff?You can't leave without my permission.That's it, Paul. I forbid you to go.If you screw this up, Paul -- Paul! The car pulls away.Shit! Shit, shit, shit! Ben turns and sees his Aunt Goldie on the porch.is listening to Vitti, but dressed as Sigmund Freud.Eins, zwei, drei!Acht gemacht gehunden nicht.Where are you going?The hell you are. You're supposed to be in my custody. We have therapy today.The one where you're Mussolini?The limp sword dream?Do you think this dream might be sexual?I don't want to know that.Okay! I get it.Sex can represent a lot of things. In your case I think it's about performance anxiety. Trying to find a job that fits.You're hyperventilating.Breathe into this. Vitti sits on a wicker chair.Excuse me?Hey, I'm doing the best I can! If you can't appreciate that, or if my best isn't good enough for you, then maybe you should find somebody else to talk to, you selfish prick! Ben breaks down and cries what amounts to one racking sob, then quickly pulls himself together.Sorry.I'm fine. I'm grieving. It's a process. Ben takes a pill bottle out of his pocket and pops a couple of pills.Echinacea and goldenseal. Do you know the TV show 'Little Caesar'?The producer of that show is a manMeet him and find out. CUT TO:This is not social. Paul's meeting a television producer who might have a job for him. He's nervous and wants me here as a buffer. I'm a buffer, that's all.He doesn't. He needs a buffer. I'm here in buffer capacity only.No, that was something else.Laura? I'm a doctor? I think I know what I'm doing.Buffer. CUT TO: INT. FBI CAR - SAME TIME Cerrone and Miller watch the front of the restaurant.Bait! That's funny. Honey, did you hear what Paul just said? He said this is like eating bait.Like what?Oh -- this? I took a couple ibuprofen before we got here -- I shouldn't have had the saki. I'll be fine. It only lasts a couple hours. Rah-oo. Row. Rowl. I guess you need both lips for that name. You know what I love about Paul? He was born without a filter. He says exactly what he's thinking -- just lays it right out there. He doesn't edit himself.See? He just told me to shut the fuck up. No filter. I love that. Isn't he great?Wow. That would be incredible. Did you hear that, Paul? Raoul wants to know if you'd be interested in working on his show as a consultant. You know, give technical advice, coach the actors --Got it.Hey, speaking of colorful -- this peacock walks into a bar --And one for me.What the hell was that?It's my job. He needs me.Actually, I hear she was tough to live with. Lot of parties, loud music -- lepers.I am.Well, you know, it's a process. I mean, we had issues -- there's some anger -- but I'll work it out. Laura goes to Ben and embraces him.No, I'm -- it's okay. Ben sits heavily on the bed.It's just a confusing time. I became a therapist because he was a therapist, so obviously his approval was very important to me. But is that the only reason I did it? I don't know. And now that he's gone, why do I keep doing it? Is this what I really want? She sits next to him and takes his hand.Maybe you're right. Maybe it's time I started focusing on me, and, you know, satisfying some ofNo, that's not what I meant. I just need -- I don't know what. She puts her arms around him and holds him. CUT TO: EXT. ROOFTOP - LATER THAT NIGHT Vitti and Jelly stand with the Gunman on the roof of the parking garage, four stories above the ground. The guy's arms are bound. Jelly ties a rope around his ankles.There must be some mistake. I didn't order a limo.Hello. I'm Ben Sobel. And you are --Yes, sir. That's right. Could you be careful, because I think they put the eggs on the bottom. He drops the bags heavily onto the bar.Who?I can't discuss a patient's case with anyone --I'd say he's still suffering from chronic anxiety and -- He hesitates.We call it Antisocial Personality Disorder. Sociopathy.Meaning -- he -- fails to conform to societal norms with respect to -- lawful behavior.He's got a -- criminal temperament.Well, I'm trying to at least show him the possibility of change --We haven't really been introduced --Ben Sobel. Ben offers his hand but she ignores it.A stromboni? That thing they clean the ice with at hockey games?No, we don't want to do that.Me? No. I'm very attached to my balls. As you can probably tell.Yes, I understand completely. May I go now? I have perishables -- He takes his groceries and edges away. CUT TO: INT. \"LITTLE CAESAR\" SET - DAY Vitti is sitting at a table with Jelly and some of his main guys. From a distance it looks like they're playing cards. Up close it's a different story.Jelly, hi. Hey! Yo-Yo!Right. I was thinking of the cellist. How's it going?That's great. Have you seen Paul?His camper. CUT TO:No, what are you doing here? I came to tell you we have a preliminary meeting with your parole officer and who do I run into? Patty LoPresti.What is this -- a knock-knock joke? Patty-who-kidnapped-me-and-threatened- to-cut-off-my-balls. Stop lying to me, Paul. Your whole gang is here.It's not that I don't trust you, I just don't -- trust you. Are you lying to me? Because I know you, Paul. You'll say or do anything to get your own way.Oh, so now you're the victim? I want the truth.Say what?I want the truth?I want the truth!Paul --I'm not an actor --Actually, I did The Music Man in tenth grade.About being on the show? I couldn't -It's not funny! There was no safety harness or anything. They could have dropped me.I know exactly what that was about. You resent the fact that you've been put in my custody, so you passive- aggressively arranged things to make me look like a fool.Really? I was scared at first, but on the second take, I think I found some good stuff. I was able to texture the screaming --Oh, screw you, Paul. Just screw you.Don't worry about me. Just worry about what you're going to say to this parole officer. What are you going to say? That you've moved out of my house. That you've got your old gang back together. For what, a high school drop-out reunion?It's my business. I want to know. I'm a federal institution.Which car?What do you mean, 'lose 'em'? Vitti stomps his foot down on Ben's, flooring the accelerator. CUT TO: EXT. HOBOKEN STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTIONMaybe I should just pull over. It could be the F.B.I.What if we just stop and get out? They're not going to shoot us in broad daylight.Sorry!We can't do this, Paul! We have to stop! This is a lease!It's a goddamn lease!Move over? Where? Vitti puts his left foot on the gas pedal and his left hand on the wheel.Seat belt. He releases the belt, then twists and crawls over the top of the driver's seat into the back, while Vitti slides into the driver's seat. CUT TO: EXT. PARKWAY - MOMENTS LATER Ben's car races past an industrial area with the Mercedes right on its tail. CUT TO:It's gonna get worse?They're right behind us! Get away! He starts whipping things out the shattered back window -- a tennis racket, sneakers, an empty Macy's box. CUT TO:I wanted to save the crossword.You think they'll get out?Where're you going?But your parole officer --I'm warning you. If you leave now --That's it! I'm finished! You're on your own now, pal! I'm -- POLICE CARS and the FBI CAR SCREECH into the parking lot and surround Ben.-- screwed.I wish I knew.I don't know anything. As far as I can tell, he's making a real effort to go straight.I'm getting that. Can I go now?Then can somebody give me a ride home?Jelly! Where's Paul? The guy in the suit turns. It's Michael.Michael? What are you doing?You got a job? That's great. Look how handsome you look in that suit. What's the job?Oh, no, you're not!I meant making sandwiches at the Subway, not driving a getaway car!I don't care if he pays you two hundred an hour, you're not doing it.He had no right to ask you without my permission. Where is he?What do you mean you can't tell me?You took an oath! Oh, my God! Was there blood involved?I was in a car chase. There was a little shooting -- not that much really -- then they -- drove into the river. It wasn't as bad as it sounds.Tonight, I hope. I just have to find him and --Yeah, but he's an amazing lout, isn't he? I can't quit now. You know that.I love you. They kiss. Then Ben turns to Michael.All right, where is he?What club?Okay, Mafiaboy, give me your car keys.No, I'm borrowing your car. He kisses Laura again and takes off.Jelly!Where's Paul? Jelly tucks a few bills into her G-string. She looks at Ben and winks suggestively.Can you break a twenty? The stripper sensuously fingers the top of her G-string, and Ben gingerly sticks the twenty in it.Do I just make my own change? He tentatively reaches for some smaller bills in her G-string but she dances away.A ten and five ones -- when you have the chance. He turns around to talk to Jelly, but he's already gone. Ben finds Jelly at a table with Vitti.Okay, Paul, what's going on?I could ask you the same thing.I do see a little Pacino there -- around the eyes.Let's do what?I'm not going until you tell me what's going on here. Vitti violently shakes off Ben's hand.Hey, guys. How's it going?Ben Sobel. Sorry, I can't move my head to the right. Boy, I hope that's not permanent.Hi, Carol.Oh, I'm not into that, fellas.I think in is better.Wait! Okay. Go ahead. CUT TO: EXT. LITTLE DARLING'S - LATER THAT NIGHT Agents Cerrone and Miller watch the front of the club from their car parked across the street.I could fit you under my shirt. Don't they have anything smaller?Nobody's going to be alive when this is over. What kind of plan is this? It's crazy. It's stupid!You mean shoot it?Jelly --Couldn't I just take this?Ooh, cold -- cold. He jams his hand down the front of his pants and starts searching around in there. Eddie and Enormous Bobby stare at him as they walk by.My gun -- fell down in my -- He shakes his leg and the gun drops out of his cuff and clatters onto the floor. He smiles weakly and picks it up. Vitti approaches. He looks agitated but under tight control.You are making a huge mistake. You know that, don't you?It's not your nature! You have a choice.So I guess that makes me a real man now. What happened to the white hat, Paul? Your father wasn't wrong. You could be one of the good guys.Okay. Vitti walks off. CUT TO: INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME Vitti comes in, locks the door and has a full-blown panic attack -- gasping for breath, sweating, whimpering, trying to stifle his panic. Then he sees his tortured face in the mirror and starts pulling himself together. CUT TO: INT. WAREHOUSE - FEW MINUTES LATER The guys are getting into the trucks. Ben keeps letting everybody go in front of him, then starts to back away, but Eddie and Enormous Bobby come up behind him and push him up into the truck.I have three-o-six.Paul, it's not too late. Don't do this.Shit! Ow! He raises his mask and scampers after Vitti rubbing the painful bump on his forehead.You're gonna get in so much trouble. CUT TO:How much is that?Really?Well, so much for not peeing in my pants.You know what you said about not flipping out?Sorry. What did I do? What did I do? I had a perfect life, I threw it away.I can't help it! My life is over! I'm going to jail. Some people can handle prison -- I'm not one of them. I have delicate features. I'm small. I'll be way too popular!I can't calm down! I'm gonna die! Inside the structure, Vitti spins him around and shakes him.I can't breathe! I'm suffocating!I can't! I'm dying! We're all going to die! Suddenly, he slaps Vitti hard across the face. They both freeze.Did I just hit you?I'm sorry, Paul. I blame myself for this. I wanted to help you. I wanted to be there for you. But I just wasn't good enough.No, it is. Since my father died -- I've lost my way. I don't know anything anymore. I mean, what's the point? I didn't think it would hit me so hard --I'm grieving, goddammit! Have a little respect!I'm grieving for myself, you fucking idiot! Ben lets it all go, sobbing for all the years of pain.Now I know how you must have felt when your father was killed. Vitti looks at him.I mean, it had to be ten times worse for you -- being murdered right in front of you. And you were so young -It must've been so painful!I mean, it's like all his hopes for you died with him. And that's so sad.Your father really loved you.I know. I know. Jelly comes around the corner and sees the two men in a weepy embrace.Rigazzi? I thought he worked for Patti LoPresti.I can't take it anymore! That's what I hate about you fucking sociopaths! You just keep changing the rules to suit yourselves. Well, not this time, you anti-social asshole. You fucked with the wrong shrink! Sitting on Eddie's chest, he presses the gun against Eddie's nose.Don't you read the papers? The guyThat's it. We're screwed. The cops walk toward the back and confront Ben.Yes, Officer?Feeling pretty good, huh?So what now? You go on the run for the rest of your life? Back to Sing Sing? Or you turn up dead in an alley?Five minutes? And then what?Did you see Patti?Did she grab your balls?Well, I talked to the U.S. Attorney.No, Paul, he did not grab my balls. He thanked me for tipping him off about the gold. And he said he won't be coming after you if you stay out of trouble. So what do you think?Good idea. Change is hard, Paul. But you did the right thing.Well, I just --I just vented my displaced aggressionI'm not a beast. I can handle myself if I have to --Well, I wrestled a bit in high school -- 122 pounds.I'm not --Fine. I have a gift.Well, I think so. Don't you feel better now?You're grieving -- it's a process.You, too, Paul. They embrace. Then Vitti starts to walk away toward Jelly who has been waiting at a respectful distance.

Cold and withholding? You had to tell everybody?Can I ask what this is about? We just came from the cemetery.Ben -- once today? Enough.That was him on the phone?And you didn't tell me?You told her -- You told her at the drop of a hat. Agents Cerrone and Miller eye each other.Oh, I see. And I don't. Why tell Laura? She couldn't possibly handle a phone call.If you don't need me anymore, I'll be in the kitchen. And two words of advice -- from one professional woman to another -- Pant. Suit. She exits.How could you? How could you bring him here? That -- -- mobster -- in my home -- eating off my dishes.Oh, there's a law that says you have to bring a gangster home?You should be in an institution. Why couldn't he just go home?Ohio! Sure. Everyone gets to be in Ohio except me.How thoughtful! What about endangering our family? I think my teeth are loose. Feel my teeth.You didn't want him, I didn't want him, but here he is! She looks up and jumps when she sees Vitti standing there.Here he is!What?That was you. You said you wanted some.Why don't you make your friend some coffee. I'm going upstairs to take a long bath and hopefully drown. Laura smiles at the two men, then exits.How long are you going to let them go on?Oh, give me a break. She's got to beOkay, sometimes you do sound like that. The O.S. MOANING kicks up another notch. Laura rolls over and jams her pillow over her ears. Ben growls, exasperated.Aunt Ester, I'm so sorry we had to put you up at the hotel. We wanted you here with us, but we had an unexpected house guest. She glares at Ben.Ben?Really. More smoked salmon? Don't be shy. Ben enters.Ben?Now in here, I thought we'd get rid of the wallpaper and maybe put in some wainscoting -- She sees Vitti and quickly steers the decorator back outside.Don't look, don't look.Do you realize it's almost noon?You want a sandwich? Make it yourself. I'm not afraid of you, Mr. Oh-I'm-A-Great-Big-Mobster Man. I want you out of my house.I've had it with the bathrobe and the skulking around and the girlfriend who, I'm sorry, is so obviously faking it's not even funny. Enough!Okay. You don't like me and I don't like you. We can at least agree on that, right?I'm going to be honest with you -- I'm a very anxious person --We have so much in common. Anyway, this is not helping me, it's not helping my marriage, and I know Ben really needs some alone time. So I'm asking you -- as a human being -- could you please leave? Yes, I'll make you a sandwich.We finally got him out of the house -- why are we having dinner with him? I mean, how professional is that?He's a grown man. I don't see why he needs a chaperone.Ben, if you say 'buffer' one more time Ben pops a couple of pills.Didn't you just take two of those?Well, you better not drink anything. You know what happens.I heard him. And I think it was 'effing bait.'Too much buffering. Way too much.Oh, my god. Could I get another one, please?No. No more for the Buffer. She glares at Ben as the table descends into silence.I don't know why you feel you have to save this man.So that automatically means you have to help him? You're always doing this -- putting other people's needs ahead of your own, like you're this martyr or saint or something. It's like living with Mother Teresa.You don't need this in your life -- especially not now. You really need to be grieving for your father.Really? I haven't seen it.It's okay, honey. You can let it go.I just want you to be happy. She kisses him.Oh, honey, I just brushed my teeth.Ben? Where've you been? What happened to you?When is this going to end?Why? A few days ago you weren't even sure you still wanted to be a therapist. Now you're going to risk your life again for that lout.Go.

Sorry about the window. Ben waves him around to the side door. CUT TO: INT. DINING AREA - MOMENTS LATER Jelly is loading up a plate of food from the buffet, talking to the elderly relatives. Laura stares at him.I love lox and bagels. I dated a Jewish woman once. Actually, she might have been the love of my life, but my mother broke it up.She was always hockin' me a chinick about the madels. A wonderful woman, my mother, but she fuckin' hates the Hebes.Makin' new friends. How's it going, Doc? I brought some clothes for Mr. Vitti.You got it. Thanks, Mrs. S. So long, everybody. Ess gesunterhait.So. Long time no see. You look good, Doc.It would appear not.New trial. The evidence in my first trail was, you know, tainted. Turns out two of the witnesses against me changed their minds -- and the third one, he died after a short illness.Gunshot wound to the head.Yeah, but it is short. Vitti, now dressed, comes out of the house and crosses to the car.I probably shouldn't be listening to this.Sorry.He's like a racehorse in that area.Yeah, I bet he gets a lot of pussy. Laura chokes on her drink.You said 'fuckin'.'Hey, pal -- got a light? The guy stops, pulls out a Zippo and lights it for Jelly.I'm trying to cut down. The Gunman recognizes Jelly and desperately reaches for the gun in his pocket, but Jelly hauls off and whacks the guy across the back of the head with a sap. As he slumps into Jelly's arms, Vitti steps out of a doorway and Jelly drags the gunman into the garage. CUT TO: INT. SOBEL HOUSE - SAME TIME Ben and Laura are getting ready for bed.He's screamin' too loud. Hold on a second. Jelly swings the guy against the building, hitting his head and dazing him momentarily.Go ahead.You said drop him.That's not what I heard.Okay, you got me there. CUT TO: EXT. RIGAZZI PLUMBING AND HEATING - NEXT MORNING A \"family\" business in Jersey. CUT TO: INT. BACK ROOM - NEXT MORNING The light from outside barely penetrates the painted windows of the shabby office. LOU RIGAZZI, aka \"Lou the Wrench,\" the aging boss of the Rigazzi family, sits in the half-light as a couple of his soldiers enter with the battered and hobbling Gunman between them.You really gonna do this?You got it. CUT TO:I got a guy in the Transit Authority. He owes me. Just let me know when.I'm an extra.A supernumerary. An 'atmosphere.' It ain't bad. You just stand around all day waitin' for them to shoot and they pay you eighty bucks.Today? About eight hundred maybe.Another grand. One of the producers really likes the ponies.Plus eighty --Hey, Dr. Sobel?It's Mo-Mo.Yeah, I think he's in his camper.Paul, not that I'm questioning, but what do we want with Eddie DeVol? Guy's a fuckin' scumbag.Hey, Doc. What are you doin' here?I think she likes you, Doc. Give her a couple of bucks. Ben reluctantly digs in his pocket and holds out a bill to the stripper.Here. See if this'll fit under your shirt.This ain't Bloomingdale's. Nobody knew you were comin'. You're lucky you're alive, Doc. He glances at Eddie DeVol.Watch it. It may be crazy but it ain't stupid. If you want to stay alive, just keep your mouth shut, do everything I tell you and try not to pee in your pants. Can you handle an M-16? He holds up an automatic rifle.No, I mean twirl it like a fuckin' baton. How about an A.K.?Kalashnikov, MAC-10, Uzi -- stop me if I hit one you like.Yeah, that's a good one. That gun brings back a lot of fond memories. Use it in good health. Ben puts the gun into the waistband of his dungarees, but it slips through and drops into his pants.Actually, gold is measured in troy ounces. 14.6 ounces to the pound. That would be... $18,396,000.Give or take. He hears a LOUD CRASH and all eyes turn to the gates.Oh, boy. This is bad.Maybe we oughta should go.
