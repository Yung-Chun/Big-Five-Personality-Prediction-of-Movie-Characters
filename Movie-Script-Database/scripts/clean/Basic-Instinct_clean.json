{"Basic-Instinct": {"NICK": {"raw_line": "Rock and roll, Gus. Johnny Boz.Before your time, pop. Mid-sixties. Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.What was it?It looks like some civic-minded, very respectable cocaine to me, Gus.Who's the girlfriend?Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --I'm Detective Curran, this is Detective Moran. We're with the San Francisco Police Department.I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --Why do you think he's dead?Who are you?Thanks.Ms. Tramell?I'm De...With an ice pick.How long were you dating him?How long were you having sex with him?Were you with him last night?Did you leave the club with him?Did you go home with him?Was there anyone with you last night?Let me ask you something, Ms. Tramell? Are you sorry he's dead?I'm sorry, Beth. I -- I got hung up in Stinson.I'm fine. Come on, Beth! You know I'm fine! How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?It's bullshit. You know it is.Things are fine. I told you. They're fine.My sex life is fine. My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.Sorry.It's been three months.No.No! I'm working my tail off. I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?Thank you.She misses me.He liked the mayor, too, right?Are you kidding me?I love it. She's got a hundred million bucks. She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars. And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.Page 67, pop. Do you know how she does the boyfriend? With an icepick, in bed, his hands tied with a white silk scarf.What if the writer did it? What are we dealing with?What if it's not the writer? What if it's someone who read the book?So what do we do -- nothing?No she won't.I don't think she's going to hide behind anybody. I don't think she's going to hide at all.Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.If that's the way you want to play it.I don't know.Do you always keep old newspapers around?I don't smoke.I quit.I thought you were out of cigarettes.I told you -- I quit.What's your new book about?What happens to him?Ms. Tramell waived her right to an attorney.I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.I told them you wouldn't want to hide.But you said you liked men to use their hands.Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.You like playing games, don't you?How about boxing? That's a game. Was that fun for you?How did you feel when he died?How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.But you didn't hurt --Because you didn't love him --Even though you were fucking him.No.How does somebody beat this machine?Sure.It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.Why not?I passed.How do you know all this stuff about me?I don't know anything that isn't police business.She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.Double Black Jack rocks, Harry.It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop? She doesn't know me. I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.Thanks, Harry.I'm sure.Now what?She knew she could beat it. That's why she asked to take it.Come on, Phil. You're not gonna let this slide. What about her parents? What about what else she's published? At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.How did they die? Was there an investigation?Fuck you, Phil.Can you get me another double Black Jack, Harry.I'm off-duty, Nilsen. You hear me? I'm off-duty discussing a case. Internal Affairs shouldn't have any trouble with that. Maybe I should put in for overtime.I'm gonna tell you once more, Nilsen --Yeah.What are you doing here?What else is new?You want to get out of here?Who?She said what you said she'd say.Why didn't you tell me?You're the shrink.Who was I making love to?I need a cigarette.She was there, wasn't she?What about me?Shit.What are you doing here, Pop?Was she ever suspect?Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?Am I... disturbing you?No, thanks.I'd like to ask you a few more questions.What kind of questions?You tell me.It was an accident. They got in the line of fire.They were drug buys. I was a vice cop.Tell me about Professor Goldstein.You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins?She wiped out her whole family.Didn't you study it in school?No.I didn't.Who has access to my file?Who's got access to my goddamn file?Don't, Beth. Don't lie to me.It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?Who?You sold her the file, didn't you?What'd she pay you?Nothin' I'll be okay, pop.I got tired of being played with.She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.I don't know.Yeah. Somethin'.I don't want to see you, Beth.I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything. We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times? It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.Yeah? Well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out. But take my advice. Put a little more life into it than you usually do.How could you let him have my file, Beth?You did it for me.Get out of here, Beth. Please?Yeah. Okay.You think I --Okay. I went after him. I lost my temper.No.Home. Watching TV.Yeah.Yeah, I was drinking.A couple days ago.What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?No.Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him? I'd have to be really dumb to do that.I don't think it's funny.I'll get my stuff tomorrow.Beth.Thank you.No. I mean it, thank you.She knows stuff about me that only you know.What was she like in school?Beth. I didn't mean what I said. About --Did you find out about her parents?You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?Thanks.She killed him.Catherine Tramell. It's part of her game.You don't but it, do you? She knew nobody would but it. She knew I'd say she did it. And she knew nobody would buy it.How exactly did you hear?I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.I like you.Yeah. Would you like to come up and have a drink?I'm not that easy to figure.Don't get too cocky.You can make a mistake.Jack Daniel's okay? It's gonna have to be.Ice?What did you pay Nilsen?What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?My wife used to call me that.What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?There's Pepsi in the fridge.Where's it going? What do you want from me?What do you want from me, Catherine?What's it about?Why does he do it?When did you write it?Yes.No.I'll risk it.To see if I can get away with it.How's your new book?I'll meet you there.She want to play? Fine. I can play.I know what that's like.Tell me something, Rocki. Man-to- man. I think she's the fuck of the century, don't you?How long you been here, Rock? You like to watch, do you?'Morning.I think Roxy got jealous.Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.She's never seen us before.I told her it was the fuck of the century.What did you think?How about Roxy? Is she a fuck to the century, too?I didn't mean for me -- I meant for you.How's your shoulder?It hurts.Are you kidding? You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?You mean getting inside you isn't going to get me any deeper into your character.I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.I don't have a choice.I know.What is this place? Hillbilly heaven?Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.I wasn't there last night, either.I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it. I always use a rubber.You oughta use a rubber, pop. You really should.You don't like punk rockers?You feeling better?I'm not afraid of her.I don't know. I'm just not.It doesn't make sense. She didn't know me three months ago.You all right, pop? You want me to drive you?Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.It was an accident.I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house. All we did was write her name down.Yeah. But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?Number one I don't remember how often I used to jack off, but it was a lot. Number two I didn't get pissed off at my dad -- even after I was old enough to know what he and mom were doing in the bedroom. Number three I don't look in the toilet before I flush it. Number four I don't wet the bed and haven't for some time. Number five You can go fuck yourselves because I'm out of here.I don't need any help.What is this interest you've got in her?I thought you hardly know her.That means you manipulate people too, doesn't it, Beth? You're a practicing psychologist -- that means you're better at it than she is.Catherine! Catherine!Did you like her to watch?No.It's OK. It's OK.Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.We're still playing games, aren't we?No?Then tell me about Nilsen.Try me.When?Why?You paid $50,000 for your character?What about the other night. What about last night? Was that to get to know your character?I don't know.Catherine says you don't like her.He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.I don't believe it.You're my friend, Gus.How old was she when this happened?I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop.I'm not sure anymore she did it.Did you check all four years?Can you check again?Can there be some mistake?Fine. Thank you.Can I talk to you a minute?You like to hang out with murderers or what? Did you know Roxy --There was no Lisa Anderson at Berkeley when you were there.Henderson. Lisa Henderson. With an H.You do?It's not gonna take long, Sam.Bring it up, will you, Sam?Bring 1976 up.You shouldn't leave your door open.Tell me about Catherine.What did she tell me, Beth?She told me it was you. You wore the same kind of clothes. You dyed your hair blonde.Did you know Noah Goldstein?You saw all the reports, Beth!She didn't hand you to me. She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.Why did you change your name?You should do something about this lock.I found Lisa Henderson.I did, too. She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.No.Homicide. San Francisco.What do you mean it's not here?Catherine told me what was in it.Don't you get it, Gus? If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley. It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.He was I.A. He probably asked her about it.She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.I know what happened. Catherine told me what happened.How'd you get in here?You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.No.No.That's below the belt.I have to do some research tomorrow.No thanks.I'm writing a book.A detective. He falls for the wrong girl.They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.Why not?Why?Hi, I'm looking for a Dr. Gardner?Yeah.He was shot.What was the weapon?Were there ever any suspects?Was his wife ever a suspect?Routine.Do you remember his name?Nilsen?Was she ever a suspect?What kind of talk?He had a girlfriend?Thanks.You did.Hi. I missed you. I finished my research.How did it end?What is this -- some kind of... Joke? Are we playing games again?I'm going with you.Gus!Put your hands up!Put your fucking hands up! Don't move.Don't! I know about your husband. You still like girls, Beth?Take your hands out of your pockets!We fuck like minks. We raise rugrats. We live happily ever after.We fuck like minks.

know who you are.How did he die?Really. Maybe that's why you're from Homicide. How?I wasn't dating him. I was fucking him.No. I'm an amateur.About a year and a half.Yes.Yes.No. We had a drink at the club. We left together. I came here. He went home.No. I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.Yes. I liked fucking him.I don't really feel like talking anymore.Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.Otherwise, get the fuck out of here. Please.Are you arresting me?Can I change into something more appropriate? It'll just take a minute.Come in.How long will this take?Only when they make interesting reading.I'm ready.Why would I need an attorney?Do you have a cigarette?Yes, you do.I found some in my purse; would you like one?It won't last.Yes I am.It teaches you to lie.You make it up, but it has to be believable. They call it suspension of disbelief.A detective. He falls for the wrong woman.She kills him.No thank you.Did I miss something?Why did you think I wouldn't want one?I have nothing to hide.What are you going to do? Charge me with smoking?I had sex with him for about a year and a half. I liked having sex with him.He wasn't afraid of experimenting. I like men like that. I like men who give me pleasure. He gave me a lot of pleasure.Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.No.No. Johnny liked to use his hands too much. I like hands and fingers.I've always had a fondness for white silk scarves. I have a very vivid imagination.No. I said I liked Johnny to use his hands. I don't give any rules, Nick. I go with the flow.I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer. I'm not stupid.Yes it does, doesn't it?The answer is no. I didn't kill him.Sometimes.Sure.Cocaine.Have you ever fucked on cocaine? It's nice.I've got a degree in psych. It goes with the turf. Games are fun.Yes it was. Bobby died.I loved him. I hurt.I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.No.That's right.You still get the pleasure. Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?Maybe I was guessing. What difference does it make?Would you like a cigarette, Nick?No.I wanted to write a book about the murder of a retired rock star. I went down to his club and picked him up. Then I had sex with him.In the beginning. Then I got to like what he did for me.I'm a writer, I use people for what I write. You write what you know. Let the world beware.Would you like me to take a lie detector test?Can I go now?Can I ask one of you for a ride?Thanks.I'm tired.If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring. It wouldn't be tiring at all.Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies. For my writing.I love the rain, don't you?You took a polygraph after you shot those two people, didn't you?You see? We're both innocent, Nick.You know all about me.You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?Thanks for the ride.Hi.No. Come in.I'm using you for my detective. In my book. You don't mind, do you?Would you like a drink? I was just going to have one.That's right. You're off the Jack Daniels too, aren't you?I'd like to ask you some, too.For my book.How does it feel to kill someone?I don't know. But you do.Four shootings in five years. All accidents.There's a name from the past.Noah was my counselor in my freshman year. That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick. For my book. Funny how the subconscious works. Hazel is my friend.Yes. She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.Only in theory. You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter? Not in theory -- in practice.What happened, Nick? Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?Tell me about the coke, Nick. The day you shot those two tourists -- how much coke did you do?Tell me, Nick.Yes, you did. They never tested you, did they? But Internal Affairs knew.Your wife knew, didn't she? She knew what was going on. Nicky got too close to the flame. Nicky liked it.That's why she killed herself?Hiya, hon. You two have met, haven't you?You're going to make a terrific character, Nick.I heard about what happened. What good's a shooter without his gun?I have attorneys. They have friends. I have friends. Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.Do you?I didn't think you'd ask me.You're not easy to figure. I'm just very good at figuring.Why not?Not me.You should put some warmth into it. You don't want it to reflect on your personality.Fine.Please.Let me do that. You like to watch me doing it, don't you?Can I have a cigarette, please? I told you you'd start smoking again.Light it for me, will you?Thank you.Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?What if I call you Nicky?I know, Nicky, but I like it.Cheers. My friends call me Catherine.Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately. You don't have any coke, do you? I love coke and Jack Daniel's.It's not the same thing, is it?Say -- \"What do you want from me, Catherine?\"I brought you something.Aren't you going to thank me?A boy kills his parents. They have a plane. He makes it look like an accident.To see if he can get away with it.You mean did I write it before my parents died?No. I wrote it years afterwards.You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?Good. I'd miss you. You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.Why take the risk?I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.Thanks for the drink.I'm leaving the house around midnight. In case you're going to follow me. I'm going down to Johnny's club.Hi, Gus.Nicky.She's seen me fuck plenty of other guys.She's seen everything before.Did you think it was so special?I thought it was a pretty good beginning.Do you want her to join us sometime?I'm not as judgmental about women as I am about men.Fine. How's your back?We're alike, you know.Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets? I don't do those.Not unless you confuse my character with my body parts.Were you frightened, Nicky?I told you I had a vivid imagination.You shouldn't play this game.You're in over your head.I've got a book to write. I'll see you around, Shooter.I should have known. I came into the house when you were down on the beach. She looked at me so strangely. She left right after you. I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time. She tried to kill you, didn't she?Do you think I told her to kill You?Everybody that I care about dies.Make love to me.For what... to set me up? She loved me she wouldn't frame me.No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited. I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college. I slept with her once. She started following me around, taking my picture. She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman. It was awful.I never have before.Isn't it just beautiful? I love it here like this.No.No more games, Nick. I'm tired of playing games!You won't believe me.I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.About three months before I met you.I'd read about your shootings in the papers. I decided to write a book about a detective. I wanted to know my character.I would've paid more. I wanted to know everything about you. Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.Maybe I'm losing interest in my book.Do you believe me?I'll convince you.Hello?It's Gus-who-doesn't-like-me.What did he say?Funny.Hazel , this is Nick. I told you all about him. This is Hazel Dobkins.Honey, why don't you go in the car? I'll be right there.Of course I knew.Look. Sometimes when I do my research, I get involved with people. It happened with you, too.Killing isn't like smoking. You can quit.I've go to go. I promised to get her home by six o'clock. She just loves \"America's Most Wanted.\"What were you doing, checking up on me? What for?Henderson.Do I scare you, Nick?I just thought I'd surprise you. What's the matter?Did you? What's she doing?You're not going to tell me what she's doing. I thought we weren't playing games anymore.And you believed her? I even went down to the campus police and made out a report about her.You still think I kill people, don't you?Liar.I decided to give you one more chance. I missed you.Did you miss me?Come over here and tell me no.Not yet it isn't.But we're getting there.I'm very good at research. I'll help you.What are you researching?Really. What are you writing about.What happens to them?It won't sell.Somebody has to die.Somebody always does.I finished my book.I told you. She kills him.Goodbye, Nick.I finished my book. Didn't you hear me?* Your character's dead. Goodbye.What do you want, Nick? Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.The games are over. You were right. It was the fuck of the century, Shooter.Right there.I heard about it... on TV.I can't allow myself to care about you -- I can't allow myself to care -- I can't -- I can't --I don't want to do this -- please -- I don't want to do this -- I lose everybody -- I don't want to lose you -- I don't want to --What do we do now, Nick?I hate rugrats.I love you.", "clean_line": "know die maybe homicide wasn dating fucking amateur year half yes yes drink club left came went home wasn mood sex night yes liked fucking feel like talking anymore read rights arrest ll downtown fuck arresting change appropriate ll minute come long interesting reading ready need attorney cigarette yes purse like won yes teaches lie believable suspension disbelief detective falls wrong woman kills thank miss think wouldn want hide going charge smoking sex year half liked having sex wasn afraid experimenting like men like like men pleasure gave lot pleasure exactly mind mr corrigan johnny liked use hands like hands fingers ve fondness white silk scarves vivid imagination said liked johnny use hands rules nick flow pretty stupid write book killing kill way described book announcing killer stupid yes answer kill sure cocaine fucked cocaine nice ve got degree psych goes turf games fun yes bobby died loved hurt felt somebody read book playing game right pleasure fuck anybody married nick maybe guessing difference like cigarette nick wanted write book murder retired rock star went club picked sex beginning got like writer use people write write know let world beware like lie detector test ask ride thanks tired guilty wanted beat machine wouldn tiring wouldn tiring professional liar spend waking hours dwelling lies writing love rain took polygraph shot people innocent nick know know like wear underwear nick thanks ride hi come detective book mind like drink going right jack daniels aren like ask book feel kill know shootings years accidents past noah counselor freshman year probably got idea icepick book funny subconscious works hazel friend yes helped understand homicidal impulse theory know homicidal impulse shooter theory practice happened nick sucked like tell coke nick day shot tourists coke tell nick yes tested internal affairs knew wife knew knew going nicky got close flame nicky liked killed hiya hon met haven going terrific character nick heard happened good shooter gun attorneys friends friends money buys lot attorneys friends wasn talking real friends gus like think ask easy figure good figuring warmth want reflect personality fine let like watch cigarette told start smoking light thank isn policeman shot shooter nicky know nicky like cheers friends catherine bitch meant affectionately coke love coke jack daniel thing want catherine brought aren going thank boy kills parents plane makes look like accident away mean write parents died wrote years going stop following leave good miss trouble cop anymore risk getting deeper deeper character thanks drink leaving house midnight case going follow going johnny club hi gus nicky seen fuck plenty guys seen think special thought pretty good beginning want join judgmental women men fine alike know want personal insights adolescent secrets confuse character body parts frightened nicky told vivid imagination shouldn play game head ve got book write ll shooter known came house beach looked strangely left right shouldn let watch wanted watch time tried kill think told kill everybody care dies love set loved wouldn frame got jealous got excited luck women girl met college slept started following taking picture dyed hair copied clothes lisa oberman awful isn beautiful love like games nick tired playing games won believe paid cash psychiatric file months met read shootings papers decided write book detective wanted know character ve paid wanted know came johnny got killed gave chance know character better maybe losing book believe ll convince hello gus like funny hazel nick told hazel dobkins honey car ll right course knew look research involved people happened killing isn like smoking quit ve promised home clock loves america wanted checking henderson scare nick thought surprise matter going tell thought weren playing games anymore believed went campus police report think kill people liar decided chance missed miss come tell isn getting good research ll help researching writing happens won sell somebody die somebody finished book told kills goodbye nick finished book hear character dead goodbye want nick flowers ll send flowers games right fuck century shooter right heard tv allow care allow care want want lose everybody want lose want nick hate rugrats love"}}}
