{"I-Still-Know-What-You-Did-Last-Summer": {"JULIE": {"raw_line": "Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been a year since my last confession...I killed a man. Well, I thought I had...then...I have these dreams...horrible dreams. And this man is always there with me.You see, he was a killer. He murdered Helen and Barry, and he would have killed me too, if I hadn't...gotten away with it. I don't know, I guess I just need to deal with the fear, the guilt...to finally say his name. Ben Willis. His name was Ben Willis...You know? But how could you...I'm sorry --I'm fine.I'm fine.I had another dream, Will.It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.It was one year ago...I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.Right. Now I remember.I'm okay.Thanks for the talk, Will. You're good to me.Oh, my god, Ray. You scared me.Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.Ray, we're just friend.Why are you being like this?Ray, I can't...I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be. It just isn't.Ray? Ray? At least come up for a while.Ray, I'm sorry. I didn't mean... I'm just scared...that's all.Okay. Okay. Face your fears...What are you doing in my closet?What are you doing in my closet?That was heart attack time, Karla.I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.There's nothing between Will and me.No I'm not.Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.No.Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?What?Ben...That could break the machine.The number's unlisted...Okay, okay. You're right....South America...Carnival...Hi.No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --It's okay.Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and... You know...It's not you, it's Southport. And it's the Bahamas! And it's free!Ray, come on. I want us to be together.Will you try...for me, please?Ray...please try. I really miss you. Okay. Bye.He's not coming. I thought he was just...But, he said he'd try.He does work hard.Then, don't.Oh!You know what? This rocks. We're going to the Bahamas!Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.Deep breaths --You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.I'm the King of the World.I will, and you remind me of the same thing.It's pretty remote here.Where is everyone? I'll ask --It sure is a beautiful old hotel.Your what?We haven't exchanged anything.Storm season?It beets being on the mainland.Why's that?Karla! You promised.Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --I miss Ray...I tried to call him.I'm Julie. This is Karla.Don't even think about it.No way.No.Not me...no way...You asked for it. Song number thirty-nine.It's...him.He did something to the screen...it, it, said...There's no way...just stop it right now...Oh, Will! I'm sorry.No, no, no. This was really sweet...No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.Are you sure? I really appreciate it.Will...?Will?It's happening again! There's a body!It's in my room!There was a body! I swear it!I wasn't dreaming.Listen to me. He's here.I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.I want off this island.Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.It's dead.Some.It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.Nice move.Cancer in a box.Houseplant.Karla!You say something?Oh, God, get me out. Get me out.I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here... We've got to get to the radio and call for help.We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.Ben Willis.They never found the body.Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.It's not him.Voodoo.Leave him alone.Let him go. I believe him.He's telling the truth. He could've easily killed me. He didn't. Look, we didn't even answer the radio question right...This whole thing was a setup.Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.I don't know.How do we know you're not?We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.Did he do it?I've got to see.I'm not dying on this island, Will. Do you hear me?Then, we fight --Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.I'm so sorry. I brought this on everyone. It's my fault.Wait, it's Nancy --Get used to it.There's no way to lock it.You sick freak.Karla!He's inside.Come on...Nancy...No way!!Move!Come on, gimme a shot --Come on, you can make it.I'm right here. Grab my hand.Okay. I'm at the bottom. Karla, just get my hand.No, you're not.All right --Did you get help?He's in it with Willis?Your stomach, you're hurt --Oh, my god, you're bleeding to death.Will, just hold on. We'll get you fixed up.You've got blood everywhere, but I can't find the wound.Why are you doing this to me?I trusted you....Why?OMIGOD --No, no, no --Just...Die.You're okay. Thank god.We don't have to tell anyone it rained the whole time. It can just be our little secret.Ray...what are you doing?Never do that again.I love it here.You know me to well.What is my problem?", "clean_line": "bless father sinned year confession killed man thought dreams horrible dreams man killer murdered helen barry killed hadn gotten away know guess need deal fear guilt finally ben willis ben willis know sorry fine fine dream church real mean feel breath thought dreams good hadn months worse mean like time freaked class hardly night sleep grades suck close thrown school year ago trying know came place right remember okay thanks talk good oh god ray scared oh friend like ray friend like ray feel like hasn healed like critical piece missing understand like head want want want fine want like isn ray ray come ray sorry mean scared okay okay face fears closet closet heart attack time karla going fat ugly depressed think hurt ray feelings tyrell unstoppable force nature tyrell appreciate seen people dance mouth face fingers karla tell ben break machine number unlisted okay okay right south america carnival hi sorry okay ray karla won trip bahamas island called tower bay wants come long weekend sit sun drink fruity drinks swim know southport bahamas free ray come want try ray try miss okay bye coming thought said try work hard oh know rocks going bahamas deep breaths think happy childhood deep breaths ve got better chance getting hit lightning king world remind thing pretty remote ll ask sure beautiful old hotel haven exchanged storm season beets mainland karla promised sure fine long snore bad mean great cute miss ray tried julie karla think way way asked song number thirty screen said way stop right oh sorry sweet little edge sorry sure appreciate happening body room body swear wasn dreaming listen crazy tyrell right dockhand guy hanging neck want island ll mainland charter dead okay believe right starting think crazy nice cancer box houseplant karla oh god crazy crazy ve got radio help going die going kill ben willis body wasn dead killed barry helen july fourth voodoo leave let believe telling truth ve easily killed look answer radio question right thing setup rio isn capital brazil wrong answer sorry lose know know ll better open stick maybe kill creep good ve got dying island hear fight karla wanted thing want involve anybody sorry brought fault wait nancy way lock sick freak karla inside come nancy way come gimme shot come right grab hand okay karla hand right help willis stomach hurt oh god bleeding death hold ll fixed ve got blood wound trusted omigod die okay thank god tell rained time little secret ray love know problem"}, "KARLA": {"raw_line": "I thought you were out of town!I thought you were out of town!i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.Yeah, right -- whatever.Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.Yet. Nothing yet.Fine, then be fat, ugly, and depressed.I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.Ask her to dance.Say yes.No means yes.Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway.Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.I know it, and it feels good. Hi, Ty.Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson. Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.Well, I'm in school and --Yes!Brazil? Um...Still here...thinking... You mean Brazil, the country?Rio de Janeiro!No. Yes?Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!I won. I won...I won, I won, I won. Now, let's see...There's Tyrell, that's one. And, there's my parents ...And I got some cousins. Okay, Julie, you can come, but Mark said four tickets. That means you gotta get yourself a date.You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?That boy has got fish on the brain. Hey, cheer up, Charlie. We're going to the Bahamas. Bahama Mama, yeah...Girl, it's gettin' down to the wire.Julie, you left four messages... Four.He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can. And I don't want to have to say I told you so...Hey, sorry... He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.I said we start having fun. And that means now.Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.We goin' Bahamas, I'm Ty's Bahama Mama. We goin' Bahamas...Honey, some folks just can't fly.No, I'm the King of the World.Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years.Check it out.Take a bath, maybe.Hello? Hello?Checking in...Karla Wilson.Oh, what?Is that bad?Julie, we're talkin' suites! That'll be just fine with us.Wait...Did you say off-season?Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true. I wanted you all to have a good trip.Oooh, the mainland --We won a competition.Rio, baby!Their stuff in there... ...and ours in here.I also promised Tyrell.He's cute...And he's got a crush on you... But...Ray made up his own mind...so, you're free to make up yours.They all start to look the same once you've worked in one. Am I right, sister?To a great weekend --So what do you do around here for fun?Karaoke -- perfect.Okay, I won't.Oh, this ain't for me, baby, this is for somebody who really needs it. Ah-hah! One single with extra cheese!Yes.Yes.Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.Julie...Tha's it. I've decided. I'm changing my major to finance. And going to Wall Street.'Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this.I spent a hundred bucks on it...even if it's just so you can pull it off.You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.Don't you get feisty...I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.Ty!How's Julie?Your not out yet, slugger. You gotta just get back up there and keep swingin'.Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?What about a radio?What the hell would you call this?You get any sleep at all?Hey --Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.Come on, Vampira. I got just the thing for you.No, this is the safe sun. It's better than a day at the beach.Exactly.Just kidding.Gee, Karla...That'll break the machine...Julie!I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.We gotta get out of here. Now.There were boats here? Refresh my memory, there were boats...Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.Julie...Julie, we have to do something.Julie, where are you going?Come on, Julie. You saw his room.What do you mean?I know I don't want to stay in here.Be careful, Julie....Today's July fourth.Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.Why? He can't help us.Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.It's too late for that.You think that's a good place to hide?Ty!What do we do?Oh, god, no --Oww...It's locked!Please! Hurry!Hurry!Come on!!Julie, come on.I don't know...Julie?I'm holding your hand!...Nancy?Help's here.
