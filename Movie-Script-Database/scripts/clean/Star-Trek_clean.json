Therefore, the only emotion I wish to convey is gratitude. Thank you, Ministers, for your consideration. Live long and prosper.... I do not know.Cadet Kirk. It is obvious you somehow managed to install and activate a sub- routine in the programming code, thereby changing the conditions of the test.To deceive by trickery.Your argument precludes the possibility of a no-win scenario --Then not only have you violated the rules, you've failed to understand the principle lesson.You, of all people should know, Cadet Kirk -- A captain cannot cheat death.Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk, had assumed command of his vessel before killed in action, did he not?How long did it take you to program the virus that allowed you to cheat?I am Vulcan. \"Like\" is not a verb in our vernacular. I've simply made the logical deduction that you're a liar.Agreed. Furthermore, you have failed to divine the purpose of the test.The purpose is to experience fear. Fear in the face of certain death. To accept that fear and maintain command of one's self and one's crew. This is a quality expected in every Starfleet captain.Fear is necessary, yes.Spock. As a Vulcan, I require no additional training to control my narcissism when making command decisions.Yes, Lieutenant?Indeed you were --An exceptional achievement, to be su--Consistently, yes--It was an attempt to avoid the appearance of favoritism.Oh. Yes, I believe you are.Captain, engineering reports \"ready for launch\".Have you disengaged the External Inertial Dampener?The cadet's logic is sound. And Lieutenant Uhura is unmatched in xenolinguistics, we would be wise to accept her conclusion.Captain, they're locking torpedoes!Captain, the Romulan ship has lowered some kind of high energy pulse device into the Vulcan atmosphere-- its signal appears to be blocking our communications and transporter abilities!Pardon me. But I don't believe you and I are acquainted.Captain. Please. I apologize, but the complexities of human pranks escape me.Dr. Puri, report --Then you have just inherited his responsibility as Chief Medical Officer.Chekov, run gravitational sensors -- I want to know what they're doing to the planet.They're creating a black hole... at the center of Vulcan?How long does the planet have?Alert Vulcan Command Center to signal a planetwide evacuation-- all channels, all frequencies -- maintain standard orbit --To evacuate the Vulcan High Council-- they're tasked with protecting our cultural history. My parents will be among them--It's not possible -- they'll be in the Katrik Arc, I must get them myself--Step aside -- I'm going to the surface.Energize --The planet's not safe, it has only seconds left -- we must evacuate now --Spock to Enterprise: take us back now!MOTHER!!!!Acting Captain's log. Stardate 2256.42: I have assumed command of the Enterprise.We've heard no word from Captain Pike. I have therefore classified him a hostage of the war criminal known as Nero.Nero, who has destroyed my home planet. And most of its six billion inhabitants. I estimate no more than ten thousand survived. While the essence of our culture has been saved, in the elders who now reside upon this ship... I am now a member of an endangered species.... I need...I need for us all to continue performing admirably.Lieutenant, have you confirmed that Nero is headed for Earth?That's not it. He said he wanted me to see something. The destruction of my home planet.The engineering comprehension necessary to artificially create a black hole may suggest the answer: such technology could theoretically be manipulated to create a tunnel through space time.If you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains -- however improbable -- must be the truth.Captain Pike left us with standing orders to rendezvous with the fleet on the other side of the quadrant.We're technologically outmatched in every way. A rescue attempt would be illogical.We must gather with the rest of Starfleet to balance the terms of our next engagement --You're assuming Nero knows how events are predicted to unfold. The contrary: Nero's very presence has altered the flow of history, beginning with the attack on the U.S.S. Kelvin, culminating in the events of today -- thereby creating a new chain of incidents that cannot be anticipated by either party.Precisely. Whatever lives we might have lived, if the time continuum was disrupted... our destinies have changed. Mr. Sulu, plot a course for the Laurentian system, Warp Factor Three--Yes, Doctor. I'm aware that James Kirk is a friend of yours. Supporting me, as you did, must have been difficult.I'm simply acknowledging your difficulties.I welcome it.... a curious metaphor, Doctor. As a stallion must first be broken before it can reach its potential.I intended to assist in the effort to re- establish communication with Starfleet. However, if crew morale would be better served by my roaming the halls weeping, I'll gladly defer to your medical expertise.I calculate no more than a four meter margin of error.Bring up video.Security, this is the captain -- seal engineering deck and bring me the intruders in turbine station three -- set phasers to stun.Who are you?We're travelling at warp -- how did you manage to get aboard this ship?As Captain of this vessel I order you to answer the question.You are not a member of this ship's crew. Under penalty of court martial, I order you to explain to me how you beamed ab --You will answer me.Escort them to the Brig.Your presumption that these experiences interfere with my abilities to command this ship is inaccurate--Yes, of course I--I will not... allow you to lecture me about the merits of emotion.Step away from me, Mr. Kirk.-- back away --Doctor. I am no longer fit for duty. I hereby relinquish my command on the grounds that I have been... emotionally compromised. Please note the time and date in the ship's log.That would be unwise.I feel as conflicted as I once was. As a child. Have I made so little progress?I feel anger. For the one who took her life. An anger I cannot stop.Doctor... Mr. Chekov is correct.I have reviewed his telemetry. If Mr. Sulu can maneuver us into position, I can beam aboard Nero's ship.Romulans and Vulcans share a common ancestry. Our cultural similarities will make it easier for me to access their ship's computer to locate the device.I would cite regulation, but I know you will simply ignore it.Thank you, Nyota.I have no comment on the matter.I am trained in the Vulcan martial art of Suus Mahna.I am unable to meld with these Romulans -- there are subtle differences in their physiology I did not anticipate --What is your computer access code?TELL! ME! THE! CODE!What you refer to as the \"Red Matter Device\" is in the main hangar -- and I've located Captain Pike.Unknown.Which may be problematic, as I am unfamiliar with this ship's design.Computer: what is your manufacturing origin?It appears you've been keeping rather important information from me.Under authority granted me by the Europa convention, I'm confiscating this illegally obtained ship and order you to surrender your vessel. No terms. No deals.Last warning: unconditional surrender or you will be destroyed.Computer, prepare self destruct sequence.Captain -- what are you doing?No, not really, not this time.Father...?... Fascinating.Then why did you send Kirk aboard when you alone could've explained the truth?... it was a test?How did you persuade him to keep your secret?You lied.A gamble...The future's not what it used to be... in the face of extinction, it's only logical I resign my Starfleet commission and help rebuild our race.My future cannot be determined by your past.

Withdraw, and I'll agree to arrange a conference with Romulan leadership at a neutral loca--I understand that -- I need officers who have been trained in advanced hand-to-hand combat!Then come with me -- Kirk, you too-- you're not supposed to be here anyway. Radio the engine room, have Chief Engineer Olsen meet us at Shuttle Bay Five.Let's go.Without transporters, we can't beam off the ship, can't assist Vulcan, can't do our job. I'm creating an opportunity: Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu and Mr. Olson will space-jump from the shuttle. You'll have chutes -- you'll land on that machine they've lowered into the atmosphere that's scrambling our gear-- you'll get inside, disable that thing then beam back to the ship.Mr. Spock, I'm leaving you in command of the ship. Once we have transport capability and communications back up, you'll contact Starfleet and report what the hell's happening here.Something you've got only precious few minutes to figure out. If all else fails, fall back and rendezvous with the fleet in the Laurentian System. Kirk. I'm promoting you to First Officer.While I'm gone we need to keep the chain of command. And you two make a swell team.It's not a prank, Spock. And I'm not the Captain. You are.I guess you'll have to come get me. Careful with the ship. She's brand new.Suit up, Gentlemen.Pre-jump on one: Three, two, one.Good luck.I'm Captain Christopher Pi--So much for diplomacy.Christopher Pike -- Captain, U.S.S. Enterprise, registry NCC-1701.No. You answer for the genocide you just committed on a peaceful planet--Then Nero, you're confused. Romulus has not been destroyed. How can you blame the Federation for something that hasn't happened--?If what you say is true... you can save Romulus. You have a second chance to --Then we have nothing more to discuss.How reassuring.Christopher Pike -- Captain, U.S.S. Enterprise, registry NCC-1701.... Kirk?I am relieved.

Jim?How did you find me--? Does Starfleet know of my presence?I have been... and always shall be... your friend.You are James T. Kirk. Your father is George, as is your brother. Your mother's name is Winona -- you were born in 2233 --... I am Spock. One hundred and thirty years senior to the Vulcan you know.It's remarkably pleasing to see you again. ... especially after the events of today.Mutiny? You are not the Captain?... by Nero.... he is a remarkably...Our minds... one and together...One hundred and twenty-seven years from now everything ends.A star in Beta Quadrant will go supernova -- and like a cancer left untreated... it will grow... and destroy everything.I saw the beginning of it myself. Vulcan Science Academy devised a plan to stop it.We built a ship containing a material capable of generating the only thing powerful enough to consume a supernova. A black hole.I agreed to pilot the ship. Knowing I would not return.My sacrifice, in service of all races, seemed only logical.Unfortunately... before I could begin the mission... the supernova destroyed Romulus.Yes. He of course blamed us. Believed Vulcan allowed his planet to die. Which was hardly the case. Let me continue.Nero came after me. Determined to thwart my mission. If Romulus was allowed to die, he said... all planets should share its fate.I needed an exit. I knew if this mission failed... everyone, everywhere... would lose everything.I realized: a large black hole could destroy the supernova. A smaller one... could be my escape. Could send me back in time, allowing me to complete my mission. So I created a black hole...Nero must have understood what I was trying to do. Because he began racing for it.Nero simply got to it first. How long I was travelling... I couldn't tell you. It was timeless. But when I arrived...Nero was waiting for me.Forgive me... emotional transference is an effect of the mind meld.\"Cthia\" is the stricture that binds our emotions... but few of us are that perfectly Vulcan.Yet remarkably, events within our timelines, characteristics, people... seem to overlap significantly. Tell me about the rest of the crew? Chekov-- Uhura --?-- Sulu --Dr. McCoy would assert our meeting here is not a matter of coincidence... but rather, indication of a higher purpose.Yes he would. Perhaps the time stream's way of attempting to mend itself. In both our histories, the same crew found its way onto the same ship in a time of ultimate crisis -- therein lies our advantage. We must go-- there's a Starfleet outpost not far from here.... yes. You often spoke of him as your inspiration for joining starfleet.You should know. He proudly lived to see you become captain of the Enterprise.A ship we must return you to as soon as possible.Are you the station chief?... Fascinating.You're Montgomery Scott.You are in fact the Mr. Scott who postulated the theory of trans-warp beaming.What if I told you your trans-warp theory was correct? That it is indeed possible to beam onto a ship that is travelling at warp speed. And that you only required the correct field equation to recrystallize dilithium?The reason you haven't heard of it, Mr. Scott... is because you haven't discovered it yet.Allow us access to your shuttle... and I will show you what a genius you actually are.Your equation for achieving trans-warp beaming.Point of fact: it did occur to you. Extrapolating Enterprise's course --Now's your chance, Mr. Scott.Agreed: the aft engineering bay is your best option: a large space and no unpredictable airlocks --No, Jim. My destiny lies along a different path.Trust me. Above all. Jim, this is the one rule you cannot break. To stop Nero, you alone must take command of your ship.Preferably not. There is, however, Starfleet Regulation 619. Yes. I forget what little regard you had for such things. 619 states that any commanding officer who is emotionally compromised by the mission at hand... must resign said command.Jim. I just lost my planet. I can tell you. I am emotionally compromised. What you must do... is get me to show it.A trick I learned from an old friend.Live long, and prosper.I am not... our father.There are so few Vulcans left. We cannot afford to ignore each other.Because you needed each other. Opposing yet complimentary opposites. It was that balance between us -- I should say you and Kirk -- that often made the impossible, possible.I'm in no position to pass judgment... my actions have robbed you of much. I could not also deprive you the revelation of all you can accomplish together... of a friendship that will define you both in ways you cannot yet realize.I inferred universe-ending paradoxes would ensue should he break his promise.I implied.An act of faith. One I hope you'll repeat in the future.And yet, you are in a unique position... you can be in two places at once.I urge you to remain in Starfleet: I've already located a suitable planet on which to establish a Vulcan colony, and assist in the foundation of a new science academy.Then I ask that you do yourself a favor. Put away logic. Do what feels right. The world you've inherited lives in the shadow of incalculable devastation... but there's no reason you must face it alone.As my customary farewell would appear oddly self serving, I will simply say... good luck.Then I ask that you do yourself a favor... put away logic, and do what feels right.
