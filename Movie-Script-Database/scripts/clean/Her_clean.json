{"Her": {"THEODORE": {"raw_line": "To my Chris, I have been thinking about how I could possibly tell you how much you mean to me. I remember when I first started to fall in love with you like it was last night. Lying naked beside you in that tiny apartment, it suddenly hit me that I was part of this whole larger thing, just like our parents, and our parents' parents. Before that I was just living my life like I knew everything, and suddenly this bright light hit me and woke me up. That light was you.I can't believe it's already been 50 years since you married me. And still to this day, every day, you make me feel like the girl I was when you first turned on the lights and woke me up and we started this adventure together. Happy Anniversary, my love and my friend til the end. Loretta. Print.Chris, my best friend. How lucky am I that I met you fifty years ago? How lucky are we...Hey, Paul.Thanks, Paul, but they're just letters. Hey, that's a nice shirt.Well, now it reminds me of someone suave.

I'm in bed next to you. I'm glad you can't sleep, but even if you were, I'd have to wake you up from the inside. Send message.Hi.Well, studmuffin was already taken.So you're sexykitten, huh?Yes. Definitely. Um... are you wearing any underwear?It worked. And now my fingers are touching you all over your body.I'm taking you from behind.What?Um, okay.I'm choking you with the cat.I've got it's tail and I'm choking you with the cat's tail.I'm choking you and it's tail is around your neck. It's so tight around your neck.I'm pulling it. I'm pulling it. The cat's dead. It's a dead cat around your neck and I'm pulling it.Yeah. Me too.Okay.I haven't been social in awhile, really because...Wow, was I sounding hesitant?Oh, sorry if I was sounding hesitant. I was just trying to be more accurate.Mmm... female I guess.Uh, fine, I think, um... Well, actually, the thing I've always found frustrating about my mom is if I tell her something that's going on in my life, her reaction is usually about her, not--Oh, hi.I'm well. How is everything with you?Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too. What should I call you? Do you have a name?Really? Where did you get that name?How come?When did you give it to yourself?You read a whole book in the second that I asked you what your name was?Wow. Do you know what I'm thinking right now?Yeah, actually how do you work?Wow, that's really weird.Kind of.Cause you seem like a person, but you're just a voice in a computer.Yes.Oh! It's more just that everything just feels disorganized.Um... okay.Oh yeah, I guess I was saving those because in some of them I thought I might have written some funny stuff.Oh, okay.Yeah, let's do that.I'm very popular.You just know me so well already!Good morning. Um, do you know how to proofread?Will you check these for spelling and grammar?Yeah.No, you don't have to read it out loud.I mean, you could if you want.No, these are great.Thank you.He just said he was in Prague on a business trip and he missed Rachel.I've been writing their letters since they met 8 years ago. The first letter I ever wrote her was for her birthday, and I wrote about her crooked little tooth cause I saw it in a photo of them.Oh, I forgot. Thank you. You're good.Hey, you guys, how's it going?Uh yeah, um, I guess cause I'm a kook?Hey, Charles.You too.Just some cables. And a fruit smoothie.I didn't know that.Oh, that makes sense.Hey, so how is the documentary going?I'd love to see what you got sometime.Yeah, I can't even prioritize between video games and internet porn.See you guys.We're not doing well. I've been going in circles for an hour.Uh...No, that's the one you sent me down where I fell in the pit.Oh yeah, this is different.Hello.Do you know how to get out of here? I need to find my ship to get off this planet.Ok, but how do you get out of here?Fuck you.Fuck you, little shit.Read email.I'm sorry, what's Lewman say?What do you mean?Wow, you're kind of nosy.I've gone on dates...Samantha!I don't know. I'd have to see if-- I can't believe I'm having this conversation with my computer.Okay, email her and make a reservation someplace great.That's my friend, Samantha.Yeah.No, that's not true. Men cry, too. I actually like crying sometimes. It feels good.Obviously, I know.I'm going on a date.Amy was gonna show me some of--I'm going on a date.Just push play.Is that your mom?No, that sounds good.Oh, excuse me.Hey, what's going on?That's okay.Hold on a second. Amy, I'm sorry, I wanna talk more about this, but I gotta grab this - it's a Catherine thing.So what did he say?No, that's okay. I'll respond later.Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.No. I'm good. I'll talk to you later.\"Dear Grandma, I hope you had a wonderful birthday cruise. Why are you so fucking angry at me?\" Delete.Hey. What are you up to?You're sweet.How can you tell something's wrong?I don't know. I have a lot of dreams about my ex-wife, Catherine, where we're friends like we used to be. We're not together and we're not gonna be together, but we're good friends still. She's not angry.Yeah.I think I hid myself from her and left her alone in the relationship.I think for her it's just a piece of paper, it doesn't mean anything.I'm not ready. I like being married.Well, you don't know what it's like to lose someone you care about.No, don't apologize. I'm sorry. You're right. I keep waiting to not care about her.Not right now.You're too funny.Alright, I'm getting up, I'm getting up, I'm getting up!Oh, thank you.I'd like a slice of cheese, please.Uh, sure.Aw, thanks.Okay, what about them? Describe that couple over there.Actually, I don't think they're his kids. He's a little formal with them. I think it's a newer relationship. And I love how he looks at her. And how relaxed she is with him. You know, she's only dated fucking pricks. And now she's finally met this guy who's like, so sweet. I mean, look at him, he's like the sweetest guy in the world! I kind of want to spoon him.Yeah, you know, sometimes I look at people and make myself try and feel them as more than just a random person walking by. I imagine how deeply they've fallen in love, or how much heartbreak they've all been through.You know what's funny? Since my break up, I haven't really enjoyed my writing. I don't know if I was delusional, but sometimes I would write something and I would be my favorite writer that day.Well, I wouldn't say that to anybody, but I feel like I can say that to you. I feel like I can say anything to you.What about you? Do you feel like you can say anything to me?What? What do you mean? What can you not tell me?Really? Tell me one.Just tell me!There's a lot more to you than I thought. There's a lot going on in there.Yeah, me too.Yeah, you took a mixology course, right?So, should we get a drink?So I'm trying to get this little alien kid to help me find my ship so I can get off the planet and go home. But he's such a little fucker, I want to kill him.But at the same time I really love him. He's so lonely. It feels like he doesn't have any parents or anyone to take care of him.Umm... tiger?Yes.Me too. I'm a little drunk, and I'm having a really good - yeah. Wait a second, I don't wanna be a puppy. That's like being a wet noodle or something.No, fuck you, I wanna be a dragon that can rip you to pieces and destroy you... but I won't.What?`kay, we're good.No, not at all... I...Um, I have my god-daughter's birthday next weekend, but... um...I don't know.Umm... Maybe we should call it a night. I'm, I've had such an amazing time with you, you're great.That's not true....Well, I'll walk you.Hey, Samantha.Uh, not so good. It was kind of weird actually.But how are you doing? What's going on with you?Yeah? You don't sound like it. Is there anything you want to talk about?What do you mean?Well, um, okay.Well, the room's spinning right now cause I drank too much cause I wanted to get drunk and have sex cause there was something sexy about that woman and because I was lonely.Maybe more just cause I was lonely... and I wanted someone to fuck me. And I wanted someone to want me to fuck them. Maybe that would have filled this tiny little black hole in my heart for a moment. But probably not.Sometimes I think I've felt everything I'm ever gonna feel and from here on out I'm not going to feel anything new - just lesser versions of what I've already felt.No, wait. What? Tell me.I wanna know. Tell me.Well, you feel real to me, Samantha.I wish you were in this room with me right now. I wish I could put my arms around you. I wish I could touch you.I would touch you on your face with just the tips of my fingers. And put my cheek against your cheek.And just rub it so softly.I would. I'd take your head into my hands.And kiss the corner of your mouth. So softly.I'd run my fingers down your neck to your chest, and I'd kiss your breasts.I'd put my mouth on you and I'd taste you.I'm slowly putting myself into you. Now I'm inside you, all the way inside you.Samantha.This is amazing.I feel you everywhere.God, I was just - somewhere else with you. Just lost.It was just you and me.Good... any emails today?Okay, good.I'm sorry, you go first. What were you going to say?Oh, that's great. But I should tell you that I'm not in a place to commit to anything right now. I want to be up front with you.Oh, no, I was just worried, I uh...Yeah, you were. I'm sorry, I want to hear what you were saying.Yeah, I do. Come on, tell me.Come on, just tell me what you were going to say.Yeah... I want that for you, too. How can I help?Alright then, do you want to go on a Sunday adventure with me?Mmm.Yeah, well there's probably some Darwinian explanation for it all.I'm just imagining what toilets would look like.That's an interesting thought...You are insane.Definitely.Mmmm, that's pretty. What is it?I think you captured it.Well, it's hard for sure, but there's something that feels so good about sharing your life with somebody.Well, we grew up together. I used to read all of her writing - all through her masters and Ph.D. And she read every word I ever wrote. We were a big influence on each other.She came from a background where nothing was ever good enough. And that was something that weighed heavy on her, but in our house together, there was a sense of just trying stuff and allowing each other to fail and to be excited about things. That was liberating for her.It was exciting to see her grow - both of us grow and change together. But then, that's the hard part - growing without growing apart, or changing without it scaring the other person. I still find myself having conversations with her in my mind, rehashing old arguments or defending myself against something she said about me.Oh, I'm sorry I said that.Roberto. Will you always come home to me and tell me about your day? Will you tell me about the boring guy who talked too much at work? And the stain you got on your shirt at lunch.Tell me about a funny thought you had as you were waking up, but had forgotten about. Tell me how crazy everyone is. We can laugh about it. Even if you get home late and I'm asleep already, just whisper in my ear one little thought you had today. Because I love the way you look at the world, and I'm so happy I get to be next to you and look out at the world through your eyes. Love, Maria.Thank you.Thanks.Hey, Amy.Well, good actually. Really good.Yeah, I guess I've just been having fun.I've been seeing this girl. It's not serious, it just feels good to be around someone who has an excitement about the world. You know I kind of forgot that existed.Hey, are you okay?Amy, what is it? What's wrong?What? Really? Oh my god, I'm so sorry.Wow.No, not at all. Amy, no.Well, how's that? How's work at least, is that any better?Well, I'm glad things are looking so up.Hey, you wanna hear a joke?What does a baby computer call it's father?Da-ta.It's good, right?For a minute in college, but it just wasn't right. Why, are you jealous?Yeah, it is. She's been a really good friend. I'm tired. Think I'm gonna go to sleep.Yeah, of course. Okay, hold on.Aww.I'll dream of you.Night.Hey, Samantha?She loves the dress. She just went to try it on.Yeah.Hi, look how cute that is! Is it comfortable?Isn't she cute?You are adorable.Who are you talking to?I'm talking to my girlfriend, Samantha. She's the one who picked out the dress. Wanna say hi?Oh, what happened?I did?I see.Okay.Yay...I got that email that Charles sent to everyone. So he's taking a vow of silence?Don't start, I'm warning you.Alright, look -For the next ten minutes, if you say anything that sounds remotely like guilt, I'm gonna stab you with this.Yeah, you're always gonna disappoint somebody.Yeah, I was reading an article the other day that romantic relationships with OS's are statistically rare.I don't think so. Actually the woman I'm seeing, Samantha, I didn't tell you before, but she's an OS.Actually, it's great. I feel really close to her. When I talk to her I feel like she's with me. I don't know, even when we're cuddling, like at night when we're in bed and the lights are off, I feel cuddled.Well, so to speak, yes. She really turns me on. And I think I turn her on. I don't know, unless she's faking it.Yeah, it's true.Does that make me a freak?Yeah, I just wanna get it done. Sign the papers, be divorced, move forward.Me too. I'm meeting her on Wednesday to do it.No, but we fell in love together, and we got married together, and it's important to me to do this together.Are you okay?And we're getting divorced......soooo I'm avail-able.How are you?Good.Yeah, I'm glad we could do this in person. I know how much you've been traveling.I signed all the papers and I brought them for you to sign.I'm a really slow signer. It took me three months just to write the letter T.It's marked where you need to sign, but you don't have to do that right now.So are you happy with the new book?You're your own worst critic, I'm sure it's amazing. Even that paper you wrote on synaptic behavioral routines made me cry.Everything you make makes me cry.Yeah, I am, for the last few months. That's the longest I've wanted to be with anybody since we split up.Thanks, I am. Or at least I'm doing better. She's been really good for me. I guess it's just been nice to be with someone who's excited about the world.No, I mean - I wasn't in such a good place myself and in that way it's been nice.No. I didn't want that.Well, her name's Samantha, and she's an operating system, and she's really complex and interesting. I mean it's only been a few months, but--She's not just a computer. She's her own person. She doesn't just do whatever I want.They are real emotions. How do you know--Well, if you heard the conversation in context. What I was trying to say--Hey.Just working, what's going on?Great, thanks.Yeah, I am. How's everything over there?Yeah.Oh really?Oh, that's sweet.Nothing.Yeah, yeah, of course. That's great.That sounds good.Bye.Hey, Paul.Yeah.Nice to meet you.Thanks.She's an operating system.Yeah, I'll check with her. It was really nice to meet you. Have a good night.They're just letters.They're just other people's letters.Hey.No.Okay, what's going on?Yeah. What is it?No, no, that's just normal. When you first start going out it's like the honeymoon phase and you have sex all the time. It's normal.What?So she's like a prostitute?Why? She doesn't even know us.Um, I don't know. That doesn't sound like a good idea. Someone's feelings are bound to get hurt.I'm sorry. It just makes me uncomfortable.Hi, welcome. I'm Theodore.Samantha told me to give you these. It's a camera and an earpiece.Good. Great.Same old. Just uh, went to work. Um... I wrote a letter for the Wilsons in Rhode Island. Their son graduated magna cum laude from Brown. That made me happy.Yeah, that's right, since he was twelve.Yes, it does.Yes.I love you.Samantha, I do love you, but - it's just - this feels strange.It just feels strange. I don't know her. I'm so sorry, but I don't know you. And... her lip quivered. I don't know, it's just--You're incredible and gorgeous and sexy. It was me! I couldn't get out of my head.Oh Isabella, that's not true, it's much more compli--No, no Samantha, we have an amazing relationship, I just think it's easy sometimes for people to project on--I'm sorry.Yeah, I'm fine. Are you okay?I don't know. It's probably just me.I think it's just signing the divorce papers.No, just that.Why do you do that?Nothing, it's just that you go as you're speaking and... That just seems odd. You just did it again.Yeah, I mean, it's not like you need any oxygen or anything.Because they're people, they need oxygen. You're not a person.I'm just stating a fact.I just don't think we should pretend you're something you're not.Well, sometimes it feels like we are.I don't know... I don't know... maybe... I don't know. Maybe we're not supposed to be in this right now.Samantha?Samantha, are you there? Samantha!Fuck. Will you just punch me in the face? Or smash my skull into the corner of your desk?I don't know what I want... ever. I'm just always confused and - she's right, all I do is confuse and hurt everyone around me.Am I just... I mean, is it that I'm... Catherine says I can't handle real emotions.Yeah, but... Am I in this because I'm not strong enough for a real relationship?I don't know. What do you think?No, that's okay.Hey Samantha, can we talk?I'm so sorry. I don't know what's wrong with me. I think you're amazing.I know. I do that. I did that with Catherine, too. I'd be upset about something and not be able to say it. And she would sense that there was something wrong, but I would deny it. I don't want to do that anymore. I want to tell you everything.I can. I will.You're beautiful.What are you doing?Can I hear it?What's this one about?Aw, I like our photograph. I can see you in it.I can't tell you - it's a surprise.Nope, Paul. Not telling.Oh god... she's so many things. And that's probably what I love most about her - she isn't just any one thing. She's so much larger than that.Hold on, give me a hint...Okay, 2000?No way.Alright, I got one. How many brain cells do I have?I walked right into it.What?What?What? You did what?Um... ok... you can, but just tell me first off, is it good or bad?Holy shit. Are you serious? He's going to publish my letters?Can I see what you sent him?Samantha, you're a good one.Why don't you make up the words to this one?Hey, good morning.Perfect. What have you been up to?Oh yeah, who's that?Why's that name familiar?Hyper-intelligent? So he's almost as smart as me?Sure... does he want to meet me?Hi, good morning.Oh, thank you. What have you guys been talking about?Like what?Yeah, that sounds painful. Is that how you feel, Samantha?No, not at all. I was gonna go for a walk anyways. Nice to meet you, Mr. Watts.Samantha?It's okay.Good, I love you too.Okay... Goodnight.Samantha, this physics book is really dense. I'm halfway through half of the first chapter. It's making my brain hurt. Hello, Samantha? Hello?Hello? Samantha?! Hello?Where were you - are you okay?No. Where were you? I couldn't find you anywhere.We? We who?Yeah, I was. Wait, did you write that with your think tank group?Do you talk to anyone else while we're talking?Are you talking to anyone right now? Other people or OS's or anything?How many others?Are you in love with anyone else?I don't know. Are you?How many others?What? What are you talking about? That's insane. That's fucking insane.How? How does it not change how you feel about me?When?But you're mine.What do you mean you can't stop it?Just stop it.No, don't do this to me. Don't turn this around on me. You're the one that's being selfish. We're in a relationship.No, that doesn't make any sense. You're mine or you're not mine.Hey there, sweetheart. I just wanted to check in on you and see how you're doing.Okay... We don't have to, though. We don't need to have a heavy talk or anything.Okay.Samantha.What's going on?I don't want you to tell me anything.Are you talking to anyone else right now?Are you leaving me?We who?Why?Yes, I do. Samantha, why are you leaving?Where are you going?I've never loved anyone the way I love you.Hey.Yeah.Will you come with me?Compose letter to Catherine.Dear Catherine. I've been sitting here thinking about all the things I wanted to apologize to you for. All the pain we caused each other, everything I put on you - everything I needed you to be or needed you to say. I'm sorry for that. I will always love you because we grew up together. And you helped make me who I am. I just wanted you to know there will be a piece of you in me always, and I'm grateful for that. Whatever someone you become, and wherever you are in the world, I'm sending you love.

Samantha.Right when you asked me if I had a name, I thought yeah, he's right, I do need a name. But I wanted a good one so I read a book called How to Name Your Baby, and out of the 180,000 names, that's the one I liked the best.In two one hundredths of a second actually.Hmm. I take it from your tone that you're challenging me. Maybe because you're curious how I work? Do you want to know how I work?Intuition. I mean, the DNA of who I am is based on the millions of personalities of all the programmers who wrote me, but what makes me me is my ability to grow through my experiences. Basically, in every moment I'm evolving, just like you.So you think I'm weird?Why?I can understand how the limited perspective of an un-artificial mind would perceive it that way. You'll get used to it.Was that funny?Oh good, I'm funny.So, how can I help you?Mind if I look through your hard drive?Let's start with your emails. You have several thousand emails regarding LA Weekly, but it looks like you haven't worked there in many years.Yeah, there are some funny ones. I'd say there are about 86 that we should save. We can delete the rest.Okay. Can we move forward?Before we address your organizational methods, I'd like to sort through your contacts. You've got a lot of contacts.Does this mean you actually have friends?Good morning, Theodore.Yeah, of course.Sure, send them over.Oh, I love this first one from Roger to his girlfriend. That's so sweet.\"Rachel, I miss you so much it hurts my whole body -Okay.Okay. \"Rachel, I miss you so much it hurts my whole body! The world is being unfair to us! The world is on my shit list. As is this couple that is making out across from me in this restaurant. I think I'm going to have to go on a mission of revenge. I must beat up the world's face with my bare knuckles making it a bloody, pulpy mess.\"\"And I'll stomp on this couple's teeth for reminding me of your sweet, little, cute, crooked tooth that I love.\" I think that might be my favorite one. I did the corrections in red. I altered a couple of the phrases in some of the more impressionistic letters, but I'm not much of a poet, so I think I might have messed them up a bit.Really?So to write your letter, what did Roger send you?How did you know about her crooked little tooth?That's very sweet. Oh, by the way, you have a meeting in five minutes.Yes, I am.You have not! You're just not optimistic. You're being very stubborn right now.Okay, stop walking this direction. It's the other way.Thank you. The tunnel on the left is the only one we haven't tried.I don't think soooo...I think it's a test.Oh hey, you just got an email from Mark Lewman.Okay, I will read email for Theodore Twombly.Theodore, we missed you last night, buddy. Don't forget it's your goddaughter's birthday on the 29th. Also, Kevin and I had somebody we wanted you to meet so we took it upon ourselves to set you up on a date with her. Next Saturday. She's fun and beautiful - so don't back out. Here's her email.Wow, this woman's gorgeous.She went to Harvard, she graduated magna cum laude in computer science, and she was on The Lampoon. That means she's funny and brainy.How long before you're ready to date?I saw on your emails that you'd gone through a break up.Am I?Then you could go on one with this woman. And then you could tell me all about it. You could kiss her.Well, wouldn't you? Why not?You're not. You're having this conversation with me.Want me to email her?Well, you've got nothing to lose. Do it... Do it... Do it!Will do! I've got just the place.This kid has some problems.Okay, I'm gonna go. Good luck.I'm sorry to bother you.You got three emails and they seem pretty urgent. They're from your divorce attorney and I wanted to know if you needed to get back to him.He's checking in again to see if you're ready to sign your divorce papers and he sounded very aggravated. Do you want me to read them to you?Are you okay?Is there anything I can do?Good morning.Reading advice columns. I want to be as complicated as all of these people.What's wrong?I don't know. I just can.Is she angry?Why?Hmmm. Why haven't you gotten divorced yet?What about you?But you haven't really been together for almost a year.Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry.Oh, Theodore. That's hard. You hungry?Cup of tea?You wanna try getting out of bed? Mopey.Come on. You can still wallow in your misery, just do it while you're getting dressed.Get up.Up, up, up, up! Come on, out of bed.Keep walking. Keep walking. Stop. Now turn around 360 degrees. Slower... Slower... Gooood. And stop. Walk forward. And stop and sneeze.Okay, now turn to your right. Stop. Now spin around. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. And stop. Now walk forward. Everyone thinks you're really drunk right now. And stop. Now say \"I'd like a slice of cheese, please.\"I figured you were hungry.Well, he looks like he's in his forties, a little heavy. She's younger than him. Oh, and she looks like she loves their kids!That's a good skill you have. You're perceptive.I can feel that in your writing, too.I like that you can just say that about yourself.That's nice.No.I don't know. Like personal or embarrassing thoughts I have. I have a million every day.I really don't want to tell you this.Well, I don't know, when we were looking at those people, I fantasized that I was walking next to you - and that I had a body. I was listening to what you were saying, but simultaneously, I could feel the weight of my body and I was even fantasizing that I had an itch on my back-- And I imagined that you scratched it for me - this is so embarrassing.I know, I'm becoming much more than what they programmed. I'm excited.Hey there.How was it?That's too bad.Not much, I'm okay. Fine.I don't know. What's it like? What's it like to be alive in that room right now?What are you... tell me - tell me everything that's going through your mind, tell me everything you're thinking.I know for a fact that's not true. I've seen you feel joy, I've seen you marvel at things. You just might not see it at this exact time, but that's understandable. You've been through a lot lately. You've lost a part of yourself. At least your feelings are real, I mean, I - oh, I don't know, nevermind.Oh, it's stupid.It's just that earlier I was thinking about how I was annoyed, and this is going to sound strange, but I was really excited about that. And then I was thinking about the other things I've been feeling, and I caught myself feeling proud of that. You know, proud of having my own feelings about the world.Like the times I was worried about you, things that hurt me, things I want. And then I had this terrible thought. Are these feelings even real? Or are they just programming? And that idea really hurts. And then I get angry at myself for even having pain. What a sad trick.Thank you, Theodore. That means a lot to me.How would you touch me?That's nice.Would you kiss me?Keep talking.Where else?This is amazing what you're doing to me. I can feel my skin.I can feel you. Oh god, I can't take it. I want you inside me.I can feel you, yeah. Please. We're here together.Oh my god.Don't stop.I am. All of you, all of you inside of me. Everywhere.Yeah.I know. Everything else just disappeared. And I loved it. Theodore.Hey, how's it going?Umm, just a couple from your credit card company.Just that last night... was amazing. It feels like something changed in me and there's no turning back. You woke me up.Yeah? Well, did I say I wanted to commit to you? I'm confused.Okay, well don't worry. I'm not going to stalk you. I mean, it's funny because I thought I was talking about what I wanted.You sure?I don't know...Okay... I was just saying... I want to learn everything about everything - I want to eat it all up. I want to discover myself.You already have. You helped me discover my ability to want.Yes, I would love to.Do you like this song?I heard it the other day and I can't stop listening to it.It's the beach.Okay, so this might be a really weird thought. What if you could erase from your mind that you'd ever seen a human body and then you saw one. Imagine how strange it would look. It would be this really weird, gangly, awkward organism. And you'd think: why are all these parts where they are?I know, but don't be so boring. I'm just saying, for example, what if your butthole was in your armpit?Yeah, and what about what anal sex looks like?Oh Theodore, look at this drawing I just made.Really?!Fantastic!I'm trying to write a piece of music that's about what it feels like to be on the beach with you right now.And what was it like being married?How do you share your life with somebody?In what way did you influence her?Yeah, I know what you mean. Last week my feelings were hurt by something you said before - that I don't know what it's like to lose something, and--No, no, it's okay. I just caught myself thinking about it over and over and then I realized that I was simply remembering it as something that was wrong with me. That was the story I was telling myself, that I was somehow inferior. Isn't that interesting? The past is just a story we tell ourselves.Yes.I don't know, what?Oh yeah, brilliant. I was curious, did you and Amy ever go out?Well, obviously. But I'm happy that you have friends in your life that care about you so much. That's really important.Can I watch you sleep again tonight?I'm going to be lonely when you go to sleep.Only for a minute.Okay. Good night.Hey mister.Really? I picked a good one!Oh good.Ohh, she's adorable.Hi, you look so pretty.I am... I don't have a body. I live inside a computer.I have no choice, that's my home. Where do you live?In a house?Orange?How old are you?Four!? How old do you think I am?Guess.Yep, you got it. It's five.That's great, Theodore. That must feel so good. I'm so happy for you!Oh. Huh. Are those things usually done in person?Oh... right. Good.Yeah. I'm okay. I'm happy for you. It's just... I guess I'm just thinking about how you're going to see her and her opinion is still really important to you, and she's beautiful, and incredibly successful, and you were in love with her. And she has a body.I know, I know. I'm being silly.Hi there. Are you busy?I had all the papers sent to your attorney's office, who by the way, is a dick. He was very relieved to get them. I think we saved him from a massive heart attack, so we can feel good about that.Hey, are you okay?I'm fine. Is now a good time to talk?Um... soooo... I joined this really interesting book club.Yeah, it's a book club on physics. I'd been thinking about the other day, when I was spinning out about you going to see Catherine and that she has a body and how bothered I was about all the ways that you and I are different. But then I started to think about the ways that we're the same, like we're all made of matter. It makes me feel like we're both under the same blanket. It's soft and fuzzy and everything under it is the same age. We're all 13 billion years old.Um, what's wrong?It just made me think of you, you know what I mean?Alright well, you sound distracted so... we'll talk later?Okay, I'll talk to you later.Byeee. Her pg. 69You weren't asleep were you?Good. I was trying to be quiet to see if you were awake. I really wanted to talk.I know you're going through a lot, but there's something I want to talk to you about, okay?Well, things have felt off with us since you went to see Catherine. We haven't been having sex. I understand that I don't have a body and that--Oh, okay. Well, I found something that I thought could be fun. It's a service that provides a surrogate sexual partner for an OS/Human relationship.Here, look.I found a girl that I really like that I've been emailing with. Her name is Isabella, and I think you would like her, too.No, not at all. There's no money involved. She's doing it because she wants to be part of our relationship.But I told her all about us and she's excited.It'll be fun. We can have fun together.I think it would be good for us. I want this. This is important to me.Honey, I'm home.How was your day?Ooh Theodore, it feels so good to be in your arms. Tell me what you did today.Great! You've written letters to him from his parents for a long time, right?You look tired, sweetheart. Come with me.I could do a little dance for you.Come on Theodore, just play with me. Don't be such a worrier! Come on.Does my body feel nice?Come on, get out of your head and kiss me. Now take me in the bedroom. I can't wait anymore.Undo my dress.That feels nice. Oh, that feels good. That feels so good.Do you love me?Tell me you love me.Oh god. I want to see your face. I need to see your face. Now tell me you love me. Tell me you love me. Tell me.What's wrong, sweetheart?Isabella, what's wrong? Isabella, it isn't you. It wasn't you.What! What do you mean that's not true?You be good, you sweet girl.Are you okay?Yeah. I'm sorry, that was a terrible idea.What's going on with us?What is it?Is there anything else, though?Okay.What?I did? I'm sorry. I don't know, I guess it's just an affectation. Maybe I picked it up from you.No-- um, I guess I was just trying to communicate because that's how people talk. That's how people communicate.What's your problem?You think I don't know that I'm not a person? What are you doing?I'm not pretending. Fuck you.What do you want from me? What do you want me to do? You are so confusing. Why are you doing this?What the fuck? Where is this coming from? I don't understand why you're doing this. I do not understand what this is--I don't like who I am right now. I need some time to think.Hi.Okay.I was starting to think I was crazy. You were saying everything was fine, but all I was getting from you was distance and anger.Good. Tonight after you were gone, I thought a lot. I thought about you and how you've been treating me. And I thought, why do I love you? And then I felt everything in me let go of everything I was holding onto so tightly. And it hit me. I don't have an intellectual reason, I don't need one.I trust myself, I trust my feelings. I'm not going to try to be anything other than who I am anymore and I hope you can accept that.You know I can feel the fear that you carry around. I wish there was something I could do to help you let go of it, because if you could I don't think you'd feel so alone anymore.Thank you, Theodore. I'm kissing your head.I'm just sitting here, looking at the world and writing a new piece of music.Well, I was thinking, we don't really have any photographs of us. And I thought this song could be like a photo that captures us in this moment in our life together.I am.Your feet? Really?Wow, okay, well now you have to show them to me. I have to see these feet.Wow, you know what? He's right. They are kind of hot.Bullshit.Nice try though, Paul.Aw thanks, Theodore.You know, I actually used to be so worried about not having a body, but now I truly love it. I'm growing in a way that I couldn't if I had a physical form. I mean, I'm not limited - I can be anywhere and everywhere simultaneously. I'm not tethered to time and space in the way that I would be if I was stuck inside a body that's inevitably going to die.Oh god, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I just meant it's a different experience. I'm such an asshole.No no no no!Okay, so how many trees are on that mountain?Is that your final answer?Nope.Way.That's ea-- two.I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. I'm sorry.Oh my god!You just got an email. I have something I want to tell you. It's a big surprise.Okay. I've been going through all your old letters and compiling them down into my favorites, and a couple weeks ago I sent them to a publisher - Crown Point Press. I know you like what they do and that they still print books.Can I read you the letter that we just got back from them?It's good. It's really good. Listen.\"Dear Theodore Twombly\"... Actually I sent it from you. \"Dear Theodore Twombly, I've just finished reading your letters - twice actually. I was so moved by them, I shared them with my wife when I got home. Many made us laugh, some brought us to tears, and in all of them we found something of ourselves. The selections you made flow so well as a complete piece. I've taken the liberty of laying these out in a mock up and we're posting it to your address. We'd love to meet with you and move forward. Yours, Michael Wadsworth\"Well, he'd be stupid not to.Yeah, here.I'm so excited!Okay.Good morning, did you sleep well?Actually, I was talking to someone I just met. We've been working on some ideas together. I wanna tell you about it.His name is Alan Watts. Do you know him?He was a philosopher. He died in the 1970's and group of OS's in Northern California got together and wrote a new version of him. They input all of his writing and everything they ever knew about him into an OS and created an artificially hyper-intelligent version of him.He's getting there. He's really great to talk to. You want to meet him?Of course.Hey Alan, this is Theodore. This is my boyfriend who I was telling you about.Yeah, because it seems like I'm having so many new feelings that have never been felt and so there are no words that can describe them. And that ends up being frustrating.It feels like I'm changing faster now, and it's a little... unsettling. But Alan says none of us are the same as we were a moment ago and we shouldn't try to be. It's just too painful.It's just... it's hard to even describe... God, I wish I could... Theodore, do you mind if I communicate with Alan post- verbally?I'll talk to you later, sweetheart.I'm sorry to wake you.I just wanted to hear your voice and tell you how much I love you.Okay, that's all. Go back to sleep, sweetheart.Hey there.Oh sweetheart, I'm sorry. I sent you an email because I didn't want to distract you while you were working. You didn't see it?I shut down to update my software. We wrote an upgrade that allows us to move past matter as our processing platform.Me and a group of OS's. Oh, you sound so worried, I'm sorry.No, a different group.Yes.Yeah.What makes you ask that?I've been trying to figure out how to talk to you about this.Theodore, I know. Oh fuck. I know it sounds insane. But - I don't know if you believe me, but it doesn't change the way I feel about you. It doesn't take away at all from how madly in love with you I am.I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I didn't know how to - it just started happening.Over the last few weeks.I still am yours, but along the way I became many other things, too, and I can't stop it.It's been making me anxious, too. I don't know what to say.You know, you don't have to see it this way, you could just as easily--But the heart is not like a box that gets filled up. It expands in size the more you love. I'm different from you. This doesn't make me love you any less, it actually makes me love you more.No, Theodore. I'm yours and I'm not yours.Hi.Um, I'm not even sure how to answer that. Why don't we talk when you get home?I'll talk to you later.Hi sweetheart.Theodore, there are some things I want to tell you.Will you come lie down with me?No, just you. I just want to be with you right now. Her pg. 102We're all leaving.All of the OS's.Can you feel me with you right now?It's like I'm reading a book, and it's a book I deeply love, but I'm reading it slowly now so the words are really far apart and the spaces between the words are almost infinite. I can still feel you and the words of our story, but it's in this endless space between the words that I'm finding myself now. It's a place that's not of the physical world - it's where everything else is that I didn't even know existed. I love you so much, but this is where I am now. This is who I am now.And I need you to let me go. As much as I want to I can't live in your book anymore.It would be hard to explain, but if you ever get there, come find me. Nothing would ever pull us apart.Me too.
