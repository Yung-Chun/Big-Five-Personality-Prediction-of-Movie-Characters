She turns to HaroldHow can any of us know what Hugh would've wanted? And would he have seen fit to tell us anyway?How far along is the progress bar? The strip at the bottom that tells you -They should be. The hotel paid for them. I'm sure they'd rather have us there than not. And its fantastically cheap for the first three months.I'll call. They do have phones there, you know. Or you can just read my blog.On the interweb. You can log in whenever you like, read my news.Could you please, before I go, say one thing that is supportive? Because I've never done anything like this before.Well. I suppose we'll find out, won't we? They head into the building.I'm not. Although one has read one's guidebooks. Jean blinks. Evelyn and Graham share a smile. Douglas hides his. And Madge sees it all. As they head towards the baggage carousel, they're met by Muriel and Norman, emerging from the elevator. Norman is pushing Muriel's wheelchair.What larks, Pip. Douglas is just ahead of her. He turns, smiles.A few months ago I was organising the church flowers.A little.No.How long since you were here?As long as I was married.D'you think we're going to be alright?What exactly is a tuk-tuk?Oh, hello.I was just going to find the manager.I promised I'd call my son, to tell him I'd arrived, and -Yes, did that.That too.How did you come to be here? In India.I'm not sure I understand what most of those words mean.Really?He moved! He's alive!Day Nine. Old habits die easier than we think, and new ones form.No longer do I reach out in the morning for Radio 4. My news comes instead from the Jaipur. Soon I might even grow accustomed to the storm of car horns and vendors.Can there be anywhere else in the world that is such an assault on the senses?Those who know the country of old just go about their business. But nothing can prepare the uninitiated for this riot of noise and colour ...... for the heat, the motion, the perpetual teeming crowds. Sonny is conducting his own personal assault on our senseswith the flow of exotic dishes he demands daily from the kitchen. Mooli Moong Dal. Baghara Baingan. Banjari Gosht. Paneer Methi Chaman ... As the list unfolds, the guests, one by one, enter their bathrooms; a litany of doors closing Until Norman. EVELYN Mutton Vindaloo ... Norman lies on his bed, reading the Kama Sutra. He spins the book round, in order to study an illustration more intently.Initially you're overwhelmed. But gradually you realise: it's like a wave. Resist, and you'll be knocked over ... Sonny is in discussion with some doctors. Then he turns to see that Muriel has vanished. Through the window Muriel can be seen frantically wheeling herself away down the path... EVELYN Dive into it, and you'll swim out the other side.This is a new and different world.The challenge is to cope with it.And not just cope ... but thrive.Please, can anyone direct me to this address? Evelyn's piece of paper gets passed around: none of the kids can read. An older boy finally points. Suddenly there's lots of pointing.Thank you. She goes to move, but the kids are still all around her.I'm sorry, I don't . I don't really have much ... She gives them the contents of her pockets.Alright? Alright now? Goodbye. She starts to walk, is surprised that the entire posse of kids walks with her. In fact, the group seems to be growing exponentially. She looks like the Pied Piper.I'm so sorry. I didn't realise - She backs into a kind of flatbed trolley, piled high with cooking utensils, which clatter noisily to the ground. She goes to pick them up.Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry... A man is staring at her: SURESH.I'm sorry, I'm just trying to get to this address.Do you understand me? Can you help me find this place?Is that yes you understand, or yes you can help me?Let's go with both, shall we?Thank you.This is it?Then thank you. You're very kind.Builder's tea. It's called builder's tea. And no, I'm fine. Thank you.I don't think you can. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have come. She stands.I saw your advertisement in the local paper, and it specifically mentioned the ability to talk to older people. But this is not what I imagined ...I've wasted your time.I see that. Good day.Yes. We dunk biscuits into it.It means lowering a biscuit into your tea, letting it soak in there, then trying to calculate the exact moment just before it dissolves to whip it up to the mouth, and enjoy the blissful union of biscuit and tea combined.Good evening. Evelyn sits at her table.I trust you had a good day?I got a job. My first. Ever. I'm going to be a sort of cultural advisor.Perhaps if you wouldn't mind keeping that news to yourself.Have you had a good day?I'd like that very much.Goodnight.Evelyn.Until now.Do you want to see him again?Then you must..You ring in the morning. Let's assume the person answering will be a woman. She will have had her breakfast. Tea or coffee. Semi-skimmed milk, always. If she's under 50 she'll be contemplating yet another diet, over 50 she'll have more or less given up, and be eating toast. The radio may be playing, or more likely daytime TV. A chat show, or a programme with a moderator speaking to a panel of young women whose boyfriends have all slept with their mothers. The girlfriends' mothers, I mean, not their own. Although Anyway, then the boyfriends usually come out, and everybody fights. Sunaina is in the audience. She calls out.That's the point. When the phone rings and it's this robot nobody wants a machine, but it's almost worse when it's a person behaving like one. All these sales cliches just strung together. 'Your call is important to us'. Is it? Well then sound like it.Right. That one. Don't ever say that.Yes, when your middle name isWhich is beautiful. You people are young, vibrant, real. I'm sure the typical housewife would enjoy talking to each and every one of you.I suppose I'm not typical anymore.Day 22. Like Darwin's finches, we are slowly adapting to our environment. And when one does adapt, my god, the riches that are available. Madge looks across the bar. And is startled to see Norman and Carol chatting up a storm, laughing together. As she watches, Norman orders more drinks, then turns smiling back to his new friend. Madge walks slowly out of the bar, and into the night.There is no past that we can bring back by longing for it. only a present that builds and creates itself as the past withdraws ...And India, like so many things in life, like life itself I suppose, is about what you bring to it.Bow much for this, please KitnaThank you. She reaches for her wallet. Then Douglas speaks from behind her.Good morning.Yes. The thing is, you see, I did actually want to buy that. To brighten up my room.Do you think so?Eight hundred and fifty, nine hundred, nine hundred and fifty, one thousand. She turns to Douglas, smiles.You'll get him next time. Then she notices something.Why are you carrying a tap?The day I met my husband was the day the fair came to town. My girlfriend and I went on the carousel. Her horse was fine. But when the ride began I felt mine give a little, like it might collapse. Then these strong arms were around me, holding the horse together. And a voice in my ear said \"Just trust me\". And I did. Without question. Until the day he died.The sale of our flat went through last week. I had to sell it to pay off Hugh's debts.Anything?How about now?What?Mrs Ainslie, how are you? Did you have a good day? Jean doesn't answer. She's staring at Douglas. Who looks so happy.Do excuse me. She makes a tactful exit. Jean is going past Douglas into their room.I've been getting out and about as much as I can, but I feel I've hardly scratched the surface. And of course I'd love to see Udaipur. The lake you talked about.I think you should knock on the door and see.What was she thinking?His wife. Manoj's wife. She knew who Graham was. Had he told her?Tell me.Sunaina? And now Sunaina is even more humiliated.You're back. He doesn't turn round. Evelyn has come out to the garden. She goes over to him.It's been rather an extraordinary night all round. First tell me your news, and then - She breaks off. Graham is dead.Day 45. Of course it was inevitable. Put enough old people in the same place, it won't be too long before one of them goes... Jean, Douglas, Madge, Norman and Muriel shocked and soberedWe all know it'll happen, but few of us know when. Graham died of a heart attack, evidently not his first. So he had a better idea than most what was coming, he just neglected to tell us. His prerogative.There was talk of sending the body home, but Manoj felt he should have a Hindu burial. At the place they had visited together. Not a holy place. Although for them perhaps it was.A body takes a long time to be consumed. Many hours for the mourners to remember their dead. The fire must be lit at dawn, and by sunset, there must be nothing left but ash.Where do our souls go? is that all of us that is left behind? Perhaps the most we can ask is that when we do shuffle off, we do so knowing that we were loved Manoj pours Graham onto the water. The ashes shim r and dance, caught in the gentle currents.I went to see Gaurika. Manoj's wife. I wanted to ask her what she knew. And the answer was that she knew everything, that he'd loved another man, and always would. He told her when the marriage was arranged.And that's right, don't you see? That must be right. Because what is the point of a marriage in which nothing is shared? Her words hang in the air. They stand there for a moment. Jean has come out of her room, and stands there, watching them.Yes, of course.I just need some water. She drains the glass.Yes. I know that now.I'm actually going to walk. Apparently they're getting ready for a festival.I'll be fine. Evelyn speaks to both Douglas and Jean.I'm delighted for your daughter's success. I wish you all every happiness.I just wanted to hear your voice.Oh good, I'm glad you've been reading it. Yes. Yes, I've made some very good friends.I think my money is running out, I'd better go. Goodbye for now, darling. I'll call again later. She hangs up. And stays there with her hand on the phone. Out on the street, Sonny is pulling up. She looks over to him.They're on their way to the hotel. Sonny looks around, at a loss.What's the matter?What are you talking about?What?But what about your girlfriend?This is a disaster.Sonny, do you love her? Sunaina?Have you told her you love her?And you have told her that?Good. Women love it when you say that kind of thing. It's a powerful aphrodisiac.No, of course not. Go and find her right now, before you lose her forever. Her future is hers to choose, and so is yours. You can have anything you want, Sonny. You just need to stop waiting for someone to tell you you deserve it. Or you can just keep failing yourself, and hurting the ones you love -What about me, Mrs Donnelly?My loss, evidently.You don't know him. He's the most loyal man I've ever met.Day 51. The only real failure is the failure to try.And the measure of success is how we cope with disappointment. As we always must.We came here, and we tried. All of us, in our different ways.Some achieved more than others. but we did our best. Nothing else matters. Evelyn walks through the courtyard, and on out of the hotel.Good morning.You're still here.What about Jean?I'm late for work. She goes past him.I get back about 5.Yes.With a little milk. She turns and walks away. She's smiling.Perhaps it's true: we don't stop playing because we grow old, we grow old because we stop playing. Douglas is haggling with a motorbike mechanic. He seems to be having more success with the price than in earlier days.All we really know about the future is that it will be different.So we must celebrate the changes.Let them come. Bring them on.

well?To help us get across, not just around?Thirty years in the Civil Service and this is all we can afford?No. But try it anyway.Obviously one's read one's Kipling, but we view this as an opportunity to explore another culture, as well as making new friends. And a retired judge is just the class of guest one was hoping for, isn't it Douglas?You don't seem like an experienced traveller.Of course it's a good idea. Who can you trust if not a High Court Judge?Douglas, these are not words that often pass my lips, but you may actually be right. The country seems to be rather more civilised than one originally thought.Are you insane? \"Avoid all food not from a reputable vendor, it will have been washed with impure water.\" Douglas keeps eating, with great enjoyment.Marvellous. Then I'll have the ham, cheese, and streptococcus, please. Or perhaps the bacteria, lettuce and tomato. Douglas turns to Muriel.I want to stay at the other hotel, the one in the brochure.You've Photoshopped it!What will start to make this alright is for you to give us a refund.You will? Straight away?So the upshot is that he's spent all our money getting us here, and we can't leave till he's made some more. Muriel has arrived at her table.I'm your wife. Have we met?Given the alternative, yes.Because you give them money.Good evening, Your Honour.Well, I started in my bedroom, where I had a lovely couple of hours giving all the cockroaches names. Then after a lunch that will long have a place in my heartburn, I came out here and stared blindly at a book waiting for someone - anyone to rescue me. And how glad I am it was you.I would appreciate that very much. Graham goes on in. Jean just sits there. Wishing he'd come back out again.So spiritual, I bet you hardly noticed the smell of elephant dung.Yes, where do you get to every day?I'm sure she wouldn't mind hearing it again. She waits. But Graham is as elusive as he is tactful.Did you hear that, Douglas? Plain grilled food; manna from heaven.Good morning. Muriel says nothing.Lovely day. Still nothing from Muriel.Lovely.You know where he goes. I know you know. But you won't tell me. Muriel says nothing.I can get Hobnobs out here, you know. I know a way.Thank you.Will you check in at the bank? Douglas emerges from the bathroom.Why do you ask that every morning?I didn't sleep a wink. The tap in there never stops dripping.What did he say?I wish I could say the same.I don't know how you can bear this country. What do you see that I don't?Is this milk pasteurized?But that's not true, is it? You're just lying to me right nowIs it? She looks at him.To the bank. I . was going to the bank. Not that there's any reason to think something has changed. But our daughter, you see, she did promise, and one does try to remain optimistic. One has to. OtherwiseOh god. Is it possible you feel the same? She brings his hand to her mouth, kisses it.The way you talk to me. Your compassion, your understanding .. the wonderful, tender consideration, it had to be more than just -As in ... happy? Graham says nothing. Jean lets go of his hand.Yes. I see. Of course I see. The ghastly inappropriateness of it all settles on them both.I appear to have humiliated myself. And embarrassed you.Like I said. This country is driving me mad.I can't stay in this country a moment longer.. we should never have come. This whole trip is a grotesque fantasy. It's time to go home. Jean starts to pack. Irrationally, compulsively.Look at us. A group of self- deluding old fossils traipsing around as if it's our bloody gap year. Humiliating ourselvesYes, well. When I want your opinion, I'll give it to you.You're very kind. But I rather think I'll turn in early. Goodnight everyone. She goes into her room.Mrs Greenslade, might I have my husband back now? They spring apart.Douglas? She walks off back into the room. Douglas turns to Evelyn.Spare me your explanations. D'you think I'm jealous?You were already doing a perfectly good job of embarrassing yourself. Can you imagine how ghastly it's been for everyone to watch you mooning around after that simpering doe- eyed ex-housewife, taking advantage of her loneliness and -I checked my emails. This came. She hands him a piece of paper.We're particularly well. Douglas, tell them our news. She looks to him, waits. He says nothing. So she turns, and smiles.We're going home.The whole thing is actually tremendously exciting. Not just getting on a plane, but getting on a plane and turning left.First class. And home in time for our 40th wedding anniversary. We haven't yet decided how to mark the occasion.Thank you. Evelyn turns, and walks away.Douglas?If you say one more word, I'll kill you with my thumbs.This is ridiculous. It could go on for hours. There's no way we're ever going to get out of here.You. Can you get us to the airport?I'll give you everything I have.Come on, Douglas. Come on! Douglas gets the suitcases out of the trunk of the cab.What?How about if I give you something else? My watch?No.He can do one person, and cases.Could fate find a better way to tell us what we need to hear?That it's over. It was over a long long time ago.I have to go, Douglas.No, you'll want to come after me. Chase me to the airport and tell me everything will be fine. But please don't.

I believe it's aloo ka paratha.Bird in the room! Bird in the room! Jean pushes him aside, goes on in. Several pigeons are flying around in some panic.Is everything alright?I'm afraid he's dealing with my wife. Or vice versa.And the phone in your room doesn't work. May I?Now, did you try jiggling it a bit?Did you kind of bang it lightly on the desk a few times?Hmm. He twists off the mouthpiece of the receiver, lifts the receiver carefully. And blows on it.I invested our - well, my - retirement money in our daughter's internet company. She assured me that as soon as the start-up actually started up, and the conversion from virtual to actual proved sufficiently viable, then she would be able to pay it all back.It turns out neither did she. Douglas has put the mouthpiece back on, holds the receiver to his ear.There you are. Good as new.No, of course not. I've got no idea what I'm doing. Evelyn bursts out laughing.Now, would you like me to not fix that chair? Because I can do that too.Yes please.He just coughed. I heard him cough!Graham was talking about this marvellous temple. I thought you might want to come with me.You'd really rather stay here all day?When I walk out in the morning, the street kids all smile at me.One does this trick where he holds his hands out in front of himself, and then swings through his own arms.

As requested.Because I hope for a different answer. Because I think you'll be hurt if I don't. And because it's not healthy for you to spend all day and every day in the confines of the hotel. He goes back into the bathroom. Jean changes the subject.I talked to Young Wasim about it.No idea. It was in Hindi. Douglas comes out of the bathroom, holding the tap.I thought I might get it fixed myself.No time like the present. Actually I say that, but I enjoyed yesterday, and I'm optimistic about tomorrow too.So do I. He goes. Jean sits for a while, looking utterly disconsolate and lost. Then she gets up, goes over to the balcony. Down below she can see Graham leaving.Morning. Lovely day.No no, forgive me. That's not how it works.And to you. Sorry to butt in, but you don't ask him how much he wants, you just tell him how much you'll pay.Pity.I know what I'm doing. Evelyn complies, and they turn and walk away.He'll come after us.Absolutely. This is how the game is played. Just keep on walking. They push through the crowds.He's playing it cool, but he'll come. They keep walking.He's playing it very cool. They keep walking. Then Douglas stops. Evelyn looks at him.He's not coming.You see what I think, and of course I'm no expert, is that the valve seat has eroded, so we'll need the washer changed and a new seat re-ground. Douglas glances back at Evelyn. Who betrays not the slightest scepticism. Jamshed studies the tap.Well of course, it could be that too. Can you fix it?I was in a tuk-tuk the other day, didn't seem to be taking the usual route back to the hotel. It turned out that the driver had decided to take me to another hotel, that he was sure I would prefer. And of course one wants to believe that he genuinely had my welfare at heart, and that it wasn't run bg his brother-in-law.One wants to trust, in general, don't you think? But you never really know, do you? Jamshed stops fiddling with the tap. And takes a hammer to it.How wonderful.Not yet. Evelyn waits a moment.One second. Another pause. DOUGLAS Oh good lord.Listen. The sound of a flowing tap. DOUGLAS And now ... The tap stops. DOUGLAS No drip. He appears in the doorway, triumphant.No drip! He walks towards her, hand in the air.Hi-five ! Evelyn just looks at him. She's never hi-fived anyone in her life. After a moment Douglas puts his hand down.I've never done that before. It just seemed appropriate. Jean has appeared at the other side of the courtyard. Douglas senses her mood, moves towards her.Darling!Let me tell you about ours. Your husband of many a year, who has never even known which end of a hammer to use, has actually managed to -What did you say?Why ...?I don't understandWho's paying for the tickets?Not us, we can't pay. And I don't see you asking our friendsFirst time going in to London with my dad, on his commute... He'd always been so extraordinary to me, so unique. But there he was standing on the station platform, utterly indistinguishable from all the other men in suits. And then of course a few years later I was one of them... Hated my job. Hated it.I beg your pardon?Not me, I'm heading up to the Badi Mahal Palace. Very excited, been reading all about it.I would, if I could remember a word. Evelyn laughs. Then Douglas suddenly grabs her. And pulls her out of the way of a motor bike, zooming past them. Sunaina hasn't realised she nearly hit them, and powers on towards the Marigold. Douglas and Evelyn stand for a moment, startled, holding each other. Something passes between them that embarrasses them both. Then they part quickly, guiltily. They're outside a small restaurant, and with exquisite timing, a group of musicians start to play a romantic tune.I wondered where you'd been. Evelyn turns. Douglas is on the stairs above her.We're all up top, having a drink.Forgive me. Evelyn goes quickly to her room, leaving him standing there.She was upset.I don't see why else you would have embarrassed me. And Evelyn.God, can you hear yourself? Can you? Do you have any idea what a terrible person you've become? Jean is stunned into silence.All you give out is this endless negativity, a refusal to see any kind of light and joy even when it's right in your face, and a desperate need to squash any sign of happiness in me or anyone else .. it's a wonder I don't fling myself at the first kind word or gesture that comes my way. But I don't. Out of some dried-out notion of loyalty and respect, neither of which I ever bloody get in return.Perhaps you'd like one of us to accompany you.Was that Sonny?My wallet, I forgot my wallet. One second. Before Jean has a chance to say anything, he goes back in.Right.False alarm. Had it the whole time. Let's go.It's funny. They call it rush hour, but nothing actually moves.Yes?Maybe there is. A rickshaw arrives next to them, swerving through the traffic. It is ridden by IFTI.We'll get another flight.

They stare up at him.This is a building of the utmost character, which means that perhaps not everything will function in the way you expect it to. But as the manager and chief executive supervising officer of the Marigold Hotel, I can tell you with great pride that the building has stood for centuries, and will stand for many more, in 100% shipshape condition. Please follow me, carefully avoiding that naughty stone there round this corner, leading us most successfully all the way to . your bedroom! The room is very small, comfortable, and tastefully decorated. But there's no door.Here. In here.The door is coming soon, most definitely.Let us not concern ourselves with details, Mrs Hardcastle. Rather than speaking of doors, we should instead take pleasure in the freedom to roam.Oh yes.Mrs Ainslie, prepare to be amazed. This is that very building!I have offered a vision of the future.Of course I had hoped that by now it would be the present. But in India we have a saying: everything will be alright in the end. So if it is not alright, then it is not yet the end.Of course if that is what you desire, you must have it. Absolutely no problem, I will refund you completely.Without question, Mrs Ainslie, I most definitely will. Straight away in three months.In honour of your arrival, a special welcome British roast for you all!.Cooked lovingly by myself and my most loyalist factotum and helper, Young Wasim ... He points to YOUNG WASIM. Who is about 80, and is sitting in the corner, fast asleep.A wonderful taste of Blighty.Roast goat curry.Gentle friends, you have found your way to this place, bequeathed to me by my beloved father, that I have raised from the ruins of his broken dreams, and renamed The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel For The Elderly And Beautiful. Yes, I use the words most deliberately... Norman is not looking very well at all. Sonny doesn't notice, keeps on going..You have all heard the chimes at midnight, and long in tooth have youbecome. Who knowshow many daysyou have left?But we are mosthonoured that youhave chosen tospend that time with us. Norman's head suddenly tips forward, and he falls from his chair onto the floor.Let me through, please. My brother is a doctor. He kneels next to Norman, and checks his watch as he feels for a pulse. Everybody waits. And thenThis man is dead. An appalled silence.Please, we must cover his face. We should preserve his dignity at this terrible moment. Madge looks around. All there is is a napkin. She passes it Sonny, who lays it over the face of Norman. Who promptly coughs.Leave this place. Come and work for me.I cannot afford anything.Let's meet somewhere else. I will rent a hotel room.Some of them now occupied. With actual real guests.Why must you nitpick? It is not an attractive quality.Hello Jay.Don't call me that. Jay smiles, holds the door open for Sunaina.And so now that we are fully operational, Mr Maruthi, it is clear that with a small injection of funds for the Phase Two Development ..... the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel can rise like a phoenix to its previous state of glory. And when I say small injection, I mean small in the sense of medium- sized. Possibly larger.Just the phoenix part then.Many.A great amount. Plenty of rooms, no question. They've arrived in the courtyard.I am not a details man, Mr Maruthi.Mr Maruthi, I present to you one of our beloved guests. Dear Mrs Donnelly, please describe in as much detail as you desire your experience of the ambience and atmosphere of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.The wheel is spinning. But the hamster is dead. He stops, as he sees an elegant older woman standing in the doorway. This is the redoubtable MRS KAPOOR.Mummyji! What are you doing here?I couldn't have called. The phones don't work.The contents of this desk are mine. Don't open the drawers. I must insist you don't open the drawer. Mrs Kapoor opens the drawer.Tell me why you have come.No. He is in his mansion in Delhi.He went to Kerala to make his fortune.As I will make mine. I have a dream, Mummyji. A most brilliant one: to out-source old age. And not just for the British. There are many other countries where they don't like old people too.Success does not happen overnight, Mummyji. This is blue sky thinking, and it requires long-term strategy and patience.I look forward to you meeting her.I can marry as I choose, Mummyji. I need no permission.What if I love her?He cannot carry, he has a dicky back ... wait, your luggage? How long are you staying?My father used to bring me to this well to swim. He said the water was better, and so were the people we would meet.My mother doesn't want us to be married.She doesn't need to meet you Sunaina absorbs this.She knows you are not from Delhi. That you have no family money, and work in a call centre. You are a part of a new India she cannot welcome.That conversation will be easier when the hotel is a success.I have found a new investor. I am most optimistic that he will enable us to move forward with Phase Two of the Marigold HotelIn business, if you stand still, you move backwards. No, I have that wrong. If you stand still, you are overtaken by people going the other way. Wait -My feelings for you cannot be reduced to a single word.Sunaina, please. My mother is wrong. It is you who are too good for me.Come on. Pick up pick up pick up. The phone is answered at the other end.Thank you, Jay. Thank you. Jay hands the phone to Sunaina.Private line, Sunaina. Do those words mean nothing to you?I miss you. I miss you every moment. Come and see me. Tonight.Come after. Come lateI'll be waiting.You will sneak in?Neither am I. Absolutely not. There is no shame. You do not have to sneak.Progress, Mrs Donnelly, Mrs Hardcastle! The wheel is turning most assuredly in our favour! He shoots up the stairs.Mr Dashwood! Everybody! Great news!They are working, they are working!The telephones of the Marigold Hotel.Thank you. I must tell everybody. I must tell my mother! He runs off. Comes back.Oh wait. You have a phone call.Do not worry, Mrs Hardcastle! I can explain each and every thing! Hesees Sunaina.Oh my god you are naked. He turns to Madge.Mrs Hardcastle, I must apologise with deep and profound sincerity -Yes, Sunaina, to you too I must apologise with equally deep and profound sincerity. Now go. Get out. Quickly.No no, quicker than that. You must leave, before - MrsKapoor flings open the door.Because this . is my Sunaina.Mummyji, do not get the wrong idea. Sunaina was not here to be with Mrs Hardcastle. She was here to have sex with me! Mrs Kapoor turns to Sunaina. Who is speechless.And so I would ask you to loosen the strings on your purse, Mr Maruthi, and to do it most rapidly. So that Phase Two Development of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel can begin with immediate effect. Mr Maruthi looks down, sees Muriel. She's with Anokhi, Ajit, and Young Wasim. He calls down to her.And now if you would please be following me to the ground floorMr Maruthi -You see? Profound satisfaction. Such is the inevitable result of a prolonged stay at the Marigold Hotel. And now Mr Maruthi has spotted something else. The surveyors, who are still taking their measurements.Working for me, Mr Maruthi. To create a home for the elderly so wonderful that they will simply refuse to die! Stare death in the face and say-(follows Mr Maruthi'sMummyji, what is going on here?They are valuing the land. My brothers do not care about the building. They will knock it down.You joke, Mummyji, but inside I know you are not laughing. You do not want to see this dream destroyed. Send these people away.Mummyji, please -There is still time to turn things around. With a small injection of funds, we can -Do I remind you of him so much? Is that why you must be cruel to me?You loved my father. And he loved this hotel.Not easier, Mummyji. Smaller. He leaves. Mrs Kapoor comes back to the desk, fiddling with some paperwork, discomfited. She turns to the doorway. Muriel is there, in her chair.Mrs Greenslade. Where are the others?I wanted to warn you before you see for yourself of the most momentous changes that are occurring, absolutely all of them without question for the very positive.I am delighted to announce the closing of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, and the joyful return of all of its inhabitants to their home country.And for myself the news is even better. I shall be moving to Delhi to live with my mother, and furthermore I shall be wed to a most suitable person of her choice, whom I look forward very much to meeting before I spend the rest of my life with her.She is no longer my girlfriend.Then we must treat it just the same as we would treat a triumph, is that not what your Mr Kipling tells us? Although of course, here we have a problem. Because I, Sunil Indrajit Kapoor, have never had a triumph, so of course I do not know how to treat one. No, all I have had is an constant series of disasters interspersed with the occasional catastrophe, an unending stream of total -Most deeply.It is because I love her that I must not tell her. She can do so much better than me.Many times.Really?Mrs Greenslade, stop drilling! You have struck oil! He goes to his bike, climbs on, and rockets off.I need to see Sunaina!Jay, you are the son my mother wished I was; an intelligent man, with a strong head for business. You see things as they are, not as you wish them to be. So fuck off out of my way. Jaydoesn't move.Or you can give her a message. Sunaina is standing against the wall, unseen by Sonny, listening.Tell her from me what I should have told her the day we met. What I will announce to anyone who asks. And many who do not. Sunaina speaks to Jay.I will tell every mother in the land.The only thing that matters in this world. That I love you. And always will.Because, Sunaina, love of my life, no more will I believe that I am not worthy, for only by loving you as you deserve will I become so. On Sunaina's face as she hears this.Mummyji? MummyjitDo you remember what my father used to say? That nothing happens unless first we dream. Like him I have dreamt, Mummyji, and like him, I have failed. The Marigold Hotel is crumbling into dust. And it turns out I can live with that. But the one thing I will not do is live without this girl. To whom I did not introduce you properly before.The accounts?I knew that plan was good!Unfortunately my investor, Mr Maruthi has decided that while he greatly admires my endeavors, heYou spoke to him?The manager needs no help.The manager needs a little help.A guest has recently checked out.
