I wish you all the best.For each thousand you invest, you take from the loading dock five hundred kilos of product a month -- to begin in July and to continue for one year -- after which time, we're even. That's it.Not good enough? Look where you're living. Look where you've been put. \"Not good enough.\" A couple of months ago, you'd be right. Not anymore.No, it isn't, that's why we're here.Did I call this meeting? You told Mr. Stern you wanted to speak to me. I'm here. Now you want to negotiate? The offer's withdrawn.Because I said I would. What do you want, a contract? To be filed where? I said what I'll do, that's our contract.What was that about the SS, the rate, the... ?But it's less. It's less than what I would pay a Pole. That's the point I'm trying to make. Poles cost more.Why should I hire Poles?No, look. It's the others. They're the ones causing these delays.Whoever. They're the ones. They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.I should send it to you, though, don't you think? You can forward it on? I'd be grateful.Done. Let's not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.Sit down.Oh, come on.My father was fond of saying you need three things in life. A good doctor, a forgiving priest and a clever accountant. The first two...Just pretend for Christ's sake.Thank you.Who is it?She's so embarrassed -- look at her --You know what, you'd like her.What --You would, though. That's what I'm saying.You look great.-- Mrs. Schindler.Mrs. Schindler.A charade? How could it be a charade?There's no way I could have known this before, but there was always something missing. In every business I tried, I see now it wasn't me that was failing, it was this thing, this missing thing. Even if I'd known what it was, there's nothing I could have done about it, because you can't create this sort of thing. And it makes all the difference in the world between success and failure.War.What?It's a beautiful city.It's up to you.It's \"okay\" with me?You're sure.If you or anyone acting as an agent for you comes to my factory again, I'll have you arrested.It was a mistake? What was a mistake? How do you know what I'm talking about?We had a deal, you broke it. One phone call and your whole family is dead.How you feeling, all right?What's the matter, everything all right at home?

I lost a worker. I expect to be compensated.Would it do any good?He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.Unlike your radiators -- and your boxes -- my products aren't for sale on the open market. This company has only one client, the German Army. And lately I've been having trouble fulfilling my obligations to my client. With your help, I hope the problem can be solved. The problem, simply, is space.I'd like you to consider a proposal which I think you'll find equitable. I'd like you to think about it and get back to me as soon as --I don't want to lease your facilities, I want to buy them. I'm prepared to offer you fair market value. And to let you stay on, if you want, as supervisors. On salary.You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door; I've never understood that. What's next?Ah, yes.All right.Am I permitted to have my secretary cancel my appointments for the day?You know? When my friends ask, I'd love to be able to tell them you treated me with the utmost courtesy and respect.Chances of getting a bottle of vodka pretty good?Wait a minute.Pajamas.You expect me to walk home, or what?If you'd return the ledgers to my office I'd appreciate it.Excuse me -- hey -- They're working.He's essential. Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt. If that happens --He is.Well, let's find him.I'm talking to a clerk.What's your name?I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.May as well get your name while you're here.Schindler.Sergeant, Mr. Tauber, thank you very much. I think I can guarantee you you'll both be in Southern Russia before the end of the month. Good evening.There he is.No, no, come on, sit --How you doing?Good.Please.I miss anything important?Oh, good, yeah.I'm sorry.You're kidding.I'd say I'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, I don't know.I go to work the other day, there's nobody there. Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone --They're mine!Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money -- I have to get somebody else, I have to train them --It's bad business.Yeah, what's that?True.Well, you've been through it. You know. You could make things easier for me.I'd be grateful.All I have is Jews.Thank God she wasn't there.She run an orphanage, your aunt?You want it sent directly to her or through you?She is.No, dear.I pay you too much.You held back Stern. You held back the one man most important to my business.What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.Here.This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.I got to go, I'll see you.The guy can turn out a hinge in less than a minute? Why the long story?Oh, yeah. You're welcome.Yeah, sure, bring him over.That's okay.Yeah, yeah, yeah.Miss Krause.Pernod? Cognac?So.Who says that?I don't do that. You've been misled. I ask one thing: whether or not a worker has certain skills. That's what I ask and that's what I care about, get out of my office.Cry and I'll have you arrested, I swear to God.People die, it's a fact of life.He wants to kill everybody? Great. What am I supposed to do, bring everybody over? Is that what you think? Yeah, send them over to Schindler, send them all. His place is a \"haven,\" didn't you know? It's not a factory, it's not an enterprise of any kind, it's a haven for people with no skills whatsoever.You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time? I know.No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.It's dangerous. It's dangerous, to me, personally.You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure. You have to think of it in his situation. He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people -- he's got a lot of things to worry about. And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people. Never the good, always the bad. Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this. He'd be all right. There'd be just the good aspects of him. Which is a wonderful crook. A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...I'll admit it's a weakness. I don't think he enjoys it. All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?Perlman, husband and wife.Give it to Goldberg, have him send them over.They don't fear us because we have the power to kill, they fear us because we have the power to kill arbitrarily. A man commits a crime, he should know better. We have him killed, we feel pretty good about it. Or we kill him ourselves and we feel even better. That's not power, though, that's justice. That's different than power. Power is when we have every justification to kill -- and we don't. That's power. That's what the emperors had. A man stole something, he's brought in before the emperor, he throws himself down on the floor, he begs for mercy, he knows he's going to die... and the emperor pardons him. This worthless man. He lets him go. That's power. That's power.Amon the Good.So you'll be rid of him.I'll talk to him.Well, I'll talk to somebody. I'll take care of it.What's he done that's so bad -- take money? That's a crime? Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war? We're here to make money, all of us.So I'll talk to him about it.He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together. What is this? I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad. We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.Yeah, well, in some eyes it doesn't matter the amount we steal, it's that we do it. Each of us sitting at this table.Did I threaten anybody here? I stated a simple fact.Come on, let's watch the girls.Thank you.Thank them for me.What's going on?What do you say we get your fire brigade out here and hose down the cars?I've got some 200-meter hoses back at D.E.F., we can reach the cars down at the end.I'm not saying you'll regret it, but you might. I want you to be aware of that.All right, sure, it's a nice day, I'll go for a drive with you guys.Where are we going?I violated the Race and Resettlement Act. Though I doubt they can point out the actual provision to me. I kissed a Jewish girl.You took my workers.When?Hey, how you doing?Let me buy you a drink.How do you do? What can I get you, what're you drinking?Things worked out. I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now? I'm going to have a good time. So are you.Goddamn it.These people, my people, I want my people.It's good business.Look --It's good for me -- I know them, I'm familiar with them. It's good for you -- you'll be compensated. It's good for the Army. You know what I'm going to make?Artillery shells. Tank shells. They need that. Everybody's happy.I just told you.All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you. What's a person worth to you.Poldek Pfefferberg... Mila Pfefferberg...You can do the same thing I'm doing. There's nothing stopping you.The investors.All of them. Szerwitz, his family.More.More.Give or take what, Stern -- how many -- count them.That's it.You can finish that page.I'm buying them. I'm paying him. I give him money, he gives me the people. If you were still working for me I'd expect you to talk me out of it, it's costing me a fortune.Give him the list, he'll sign it, he'll get the people ready. I have to go back to Brinnlitz, to take care of things on that end, I'll see you there.Finish the page.This is my home.I was born here, my wife was born here, my mother is buried here, this is my home.Do you really think I'd bring a thousand Jewish criminals into my home?These are skilled munitions workers -- they are essential to the war effort ---- It is my duty to supervise them -- and it is your duty to allow me --You'll be interested to know I received a cable this morning from the Personnel Office, Plaszow. The women have left. They should be arriving here sometime tomorrow.They're in Auschwitz.I'm sorry to hear that.I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back. I have to leave.All right, okay, let's talk.Breslau? I can't go to Breslau. Not now.He stole our country blind.I appreciate it. I want these.These are mine. They're on the list. These are my workers. They should be on the train.They're skilled munition workers. They're essential.Yes.Their fingers. They polish the insides of shell casings. How else do you expect me to polish the inside of a 45 millimeter shell casing?Under Department W provisions, it is unlawful to kill a worker without just cause. Under the Businesses Compensation Fund I am entitled to file damage claims for such deaths. If you shoot without thinking, you go to prison and I get paid, that's how it works. So there will be no summary executions here. There will be no interference of any kind with production. In hopes of ensuring that, guards will no longer be allowed on the factory floor without my authorization.For your cooperation, you have my gratitude.How's it going?Good.This isn't right, is it?There. That looks right.How's it going, Rabbi?Sun's going down.It is Friday, isn't it?You should be preparing for the Sabbath, shouldn't you? What are you doing here?I've got some wine in my office. Why don't we go over there, I'll give it to you. Come on, let's go.Come on.I want you to come work for me.You don't have to live with me, I wouldn't ask that. It's a nice place. You'd like it. It looks awful. You get used to that.All right -- We can spend time together that way. We can see each other, see how it goes -- without the strain of -- whatever you want to call it when a man, a husband and a wife go out to dinner, go have a drink, go to a party, you know. This way we'll see each other at work, there we are, same place, we see how it goes...Itzhak Stern, Emilie Schindler. My wife.Emilie's offered to work in the clinic. To... work there.Yes.Can you fix it? The radio.How should I know? It's broken. See what you can do.Stern.They arrived, can you believe it?Well, that's to be expected. They have to understand. These are start- up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business. I'll write them a letter.Well, sure. So would I. So would you. I wouldn't worry about it. We'll get it right one of these days.No?All right. Call around, find out where we can buy shells and buy them. We'll pass them off as ours.You don't? I do. I see a difference.Fewer shells will be made.Stern, if this factory ever produces a shell that can actually be fired... I'll be very unhappy.Hey.Shoot him. Shoot him!Shoot him without a hearing. Come on.The machine's broken?But the machine.The machine is under the authorization of the Armaments Inspectorate. I will preside over the hearing.If you're not skilled at armaments work, you shouldn't be here.What?The stupidity of these people. I wish they were capable of sabotaging a machine.Get him out of my sight.Isn't this nice.Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.I need a drink.Wine?I need guns.One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate. I'd like the chance to defend myself. I'd like my wife to have that chance. My civilian engineers. My secretary.It kind of looks that way.Pistols, rifles, carbines ... I'd be grateful.Careful.Stern.No, no, what, what is it?No.Why, am I broke?Poldek.It's been suggested I cremate them in my furnaces. As a Catholic I will not. As a human being I will not.These aren't suicides.These are victims of a great murder.Probably looking for a handout.The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.I'll discipline him later.It's time the guards came into the factory.The unconditional surrender of Germany has just been announced. At midnight tonight the war is over.Tomorrow, you'll begin the process of looking for survivors of your families. In many cases you won't find them. After six long years of murder, victims are being mourned throughout the world.We've survived. Some of you have come up to me and thanked me. Thank yourselves. Thank your fearless Stern, and others among you, who, worrying about you, have faced death every moment. Thank you.You've shown extraordinary discipline. You've behaved humanely here. You should be proud.I'm a member of the Nazi party. I'm a munitions manufacturer. I'm a profiteer of slave labor, I'm a criminal. At midnight, you will be free and I will be hunted. I'll remain with you until five minutes after midnight After which time, and I hope you'll forgive me, I have to flee.In memory of the countless victims among your people, I ask us to observe three minutes of silence.I know you've received orders from our Commandant -- which he has received from his superiors -- to dispose of the population of this camp.Now would be the time to do it. They're all here. This is your opportunity.Or... ...you could leave. And return to your families as men instead of murderers.Thank you.I could've got more out...I could've got more... if I'd just... I don't know, if I'd just... I could've got more...If I'd made more money... I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just...I didn't do enough.This car. Goeth would've bought this car. Why did I keep the car? Ten people, right there, ten more I could've got. This pin --Two people. This is gold. Two more people. He would've given me two for it. At least one. He would've given me one. One more. One more person. A person, Stern. For this. One more. I could've gotten one more person I didn't.They killed so many people... They killed so many people...Hey, how you doing?Things are great, things are great.I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.I've been here. I guess I haven't been out.Yeah?

I have to know -- where do you get a suit like that? what is that, silk? It's great.Something wonderful's happened, do you know what it is? Without planning it, we've reached that happy point in our careers where duty and financial opportunity meet.They're not gone, they're here.We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter --Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do? You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done. Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example. But that's good business.Scherner told me something else about you.That you know the meaning of the word gratitude. That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.You want to stay where you are. You got things going on the side, things are good, you don't want anybody telling you what to do -- I can understand all that. What you want is your own sub-camp.Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone? Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy. Then the engineers show up. They stand around and they argue about drainage -- I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.Happened to what's his name -- up in Warsaw -- and he was bigger than you, Oskar.Happened to Toebbens. Almost. Himmler goes up to Warsaw, tells the armament guys, \"Get the fucking Jews out of Toebbens' factory and put Toebbens in the army,\" and -- \"and sent him to the Front.\" I mean, the Front.It's true. Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.He's important to my business.I want him. Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.What are you making?I got some workers coming in tomorrow... Where the hell they from again?Yugoslavia. I got to make room.Make me a hinge.Another.That's very good. What I don't understand, though, is -- you've been working since what, about six this morning? Yet such a small pile of hinges?Christ --God damn it --Nobody knows who stole the chicken. A man walks around with a chicken, nobody notices this.Still nobody knows.There we go.It was you? You committed this crime?You know who, though.Oh, that's all right.What are you using?Soap? Not lye?Go ahead, go on, leave. I pardon you.My mechanic.I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought. Have a drink.I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them. It's always something.They're complaining now? They don't know what complaining is.Bring the fire trucks!This is really cruel, Oskar, you're giving them hope. You shouldn't do that, that's cruel.Hujar!Oh, my God.He likes women. He likes good-looking women. He sees a good-looking woman, he doesn't think. This guy has so many women. They love him. He's married, he's got all these women. All right, she was Jewish, he shouldn't have done it. But you didn't see this girl. I saw this girl. This girl was very good-looking.They cast a spell on you, you know, the Jews. You work closely with them like I do, you see this. They have this power, it's like a virus. Some of my men are infected with this virus. They should be pitied, not punished. They should receive treatment, because this is as real as typhus. I see this all the time.It's a matter of money? We can discuss that. That'd be all right with me.A \"bribe?\" No, no, please come on... a gratuity.Sir.God forbid you ever get a real taste for Jewish skirt. There's no future in it. No future. They don't have a future. And that's not just good old- fashioned Jew-hating talk. It's policy now.Enough -- Jesus -- God --Can you believe this?I'm trying to live my life, they come up with this? I got to find every body buried up here? And burn it?They're taking mine. When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow. Auschwitz.I don't know. Soon.This is good. I'm out of business and he's catching tadpoles with his son.You want these people.What are you, Moses? What is this? Where's the money in this? What's the scam?Oh, this is \"good business\" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia -- it doesn't make any sense.You're not telling me something.Yeah, sure.You're probably scamming me somehow. If I'm making a hundred, you got to be making three.If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually. But how?You did, but you didn't.Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.What's one worth to you? That's the question.A virus...Thank you.Where are the guards?", "clean_line": "nice driveway shoot argued man shoot sure right somebody knew somebody needed pour rebuild like said today history young ask wonder day today history footing blame black death kazimierz great called told jews come cracow came trundled belongings city settled took hold prospered centuries jewish cracow weekend centuries rumor happened today history started know told going trouble czurda scherner looks great know suit like silk great wonderful happened know planning ve reached happy point careers duty financial opportunity meet gone going making money going matter boys went crazy going right bad business occasionally sure okay got example good business scherner told know meaning word gratitude vague thing like guys want stay got things going things good want anybody telling understand want sub camp idea involved paperwork forget got build getting fucking permits drive crazy engineers stand argue drainage telling ll want shoot somebody ve know happened warsaw bigger oskar happened toebbens himmler goes warsaw tells armament guys fucking jews toebbens factory toebbens army sent mean true happen cracow love important business want come let inside let good time making got workers coming tomorrow hell yugoslavia got room hinge good understand ve working morning small pile hinges christ god damn knows stole chicken man walks chicken notices knows committed crime know oh right soap lye ahead leave pardon mechanic tried running little late taking longer thought drink got shipment hungarians coming got room complaining know complaining bring trucks cruel oskar giving hope shouldn cruel hujar oh god likes women likes good looking women sees good looking woman think guy women love married got women right jewish shouldn girl saw girl girl good looking cast spell know jews work closely like power like virus men infected virus pitied punished receive treatment real typhus time matter money discuss right bribe come gratuity sir god forbid real taste jewish skirt future future future good old fashioned jew hating talk policy jesus god believe trying live life come got body buried burn taking said future mean tomorrow auschwitz know soon good business catching tadpoles son want people moses money scam oh good business opinion ve got equipment czechoslovakia sense telling yeah sure probably scamming making got making admit making actually yeah right tell ll irritating figure worth question virus thank guards"}}}
