Come here, come.You see, I don't want this to get out for a while. I'm Mortimer Brewster.Mortimer Brew...Goodbye, dear.Don't you understand ? How can I marry you ? Me, the symbol of bachelorhood. I've sneered at every love scene in every play. I've written four million words against marriage ! Not only hooked, but to a minister's daughter, and not only a minister's daughter but a girl from Brooklyn. And look at the way you look ! What is that sort of contraption you've got there ?Yeah, I know that \"Something borrowed, something blue.\" Old, new. Rice and old shoes. Carry you over the threshold. Niagara Falls. All that silly tripe I made fun for years. Is this what I've come to ? I can't go through with it. I won't marry you. And that's that.What do you mean, \u00abYes, Mortimer\u00bb ? Aren't you insulted ? Aren't you going to cry ? Aren't you going to make a scene ?And don't \u00abNo, Mortimer\u00bb me, either ! Don't you see marriage is a superstition. It's old-fashioned. It's... a... a... Ohh !...Elaine !You ain't seen anything yet. You've got to drive us to the station.Oh thanks.If you find her hairpins, you can keep them. Hold on to that.Here's your hat.What ? What's the matter ?He did ? He did ? What did he say ? What did he say ?Ah ! But that was only Sunday.Please ! For heaven's sake !Yeah ! Right out here in the open with everyone looking. Let everyone in Brooklyn over 16 look.One thing at a time.\u00abThere's that look again, Mortimer !\u00bb You better get used to it.Look like you're going to see it often. It goes just before this. He kisses her very passionately.You know what we're doing, darling ? We're wasting time. Look, I'll go tell my aunts and you tell your old... No, you'd better not tell your father just yet. You'll run that cold of his into a pneumonia.Look, why don't we wire him from Niagara Falls ?Yes, certainly ! We're going to go the whole hog. Niagara Falls ! Everybody ought to go to Niagara Falls. You should've seen my secretary's face when I made the reservation. We've got a drawing-room on the train, the bridal suite in the hotel, and tomorrow morning we go over the falls in a barrel.Go on, darling, hurry and pack.There, you see ! You see ? That's what I mean. That's what I hate about women.Go on, darling, the train leaves in an hour, and hurry.Whistle when you're ready. Oh, Elaine...When you whistle, open the front door fast. If you see a tall, dark streak of light, it's me.What ? Now ?Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha !Hold on to your bustles. We're married. Elaine and I are married.Yeah ! Don't pretend to be so surprised either, you two old frauds. Can I use the telephone, darling ?Oh, now, here, here, now ! Hello ?... Hello ? Benson's Florists ? This is Mortimer Brewster. Did you send those roses to Missis Brewster's apartment ?... You did ? Good. Now, send four dozen more to drawing room A, Canadian Limited, Grand Central Station. Yes... And hurry then. And throw in a flock of orange blossoms.Oh, darling, you won't have time to bake a cake. We're going to Niagara Falls. I've got a taxi waiting.Yeah, I bet it's been ready since the first day I met her, huh ?What is it ? Did everybody in Brooklyn know I was getting married, except me ?Come here. I've got the two nicest aunts in the world. Of course, you've got the nicest nephew in the world, too.Well, I'm going to burn all my books. And I'll let the Reverend Harper light the first match. Oh, by the way, did I leave some notes here for my new book ?Yes ! Shhh ! Where are they ?Come on, come on. Let's go.Let's find them before Elaine sees them.How are you, Mister President ?Just this, Mister President. The country's squarely behind you.Goodbye, Mister President.Did you find those notes ?What's the matter ?You ought to put that in the fire with my books. My, what a face !I remember now. He used to scare grownups with it.Oh, Jonathan ? Oh, he's probably in prison or hanged or something by now.I saw a play, which had a character in it. Reminded me of Jonathan.Yeah. Oh, a honey of a lunatic. One of those whodunits called \u00abMurder Will Out\u00bb.Yeah, what a play. When the curtain goes up, the first thing you see is a dead body.The next thing...Hey, mister. He remains a few seconds seated of the seat, with a very puzzled face.Never mind that now. I know.Now, listen, darlings. Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha, you know how we've always planned to send Teddy to that Sanitarium, Happy Dale ?No, no. Teddy's got to go to Happy Dale now. At once ! Now, he's down in the cellar. Get him up here right away.Well, look, darlings. Look, I'm frightfully sorry, but I've got an awful shock for you.Teddy's killed a man, darlings !But there's a body in the window-seat !You know ?Forget ?What the... Who is he ?That's all you know ? But what's he doing here ? What happened to him ?Look, Aunt Martha, men just don't get into window-seats and die.Oh, well, now wait ! Stop all this.Now look, darlings, how did he die ?But, how did the poison get in the wine ?You mean you... You put it in the wine ?Ohh ! Look at me, darling.You mean, you mean you knew what you'd done and you didn't want the Reverend Harper to see the body ?Ohh ! It's first-degree.Operator ?... Can you hear my voice ?... You can ?... Are you sure ?...Then I must be here.Aunt Abby ! Aunt Martha !Lick the bowl ? I don't want to lick the bowl. I want to know what we're going to do !Celebrate ? There's a body in the window-seat !Oh, I know what his name is. I just want to know what we're going to do. We can't turn you over to the police.Forget ? Look, my dear aunt Martha, can't I make you realize that something has to be done ?But, but Mister Hodgekiss...But whatever his name is, you can't leave him in there.Oh, you mean you're going to bury Mister Hodgekiss in the cellar ?Look, here, Aunt Martha. You can't...Others ?Oh ! When you say \u00abothers\u00bb, do you mean \u00abothers\u00bb ? More than one \u00abothers\u00bb ?Makes it twelve. Well...Hello ?Oh !Hello ?Not now. Not now. For heaven's sake, keep your shirt on !Oh... Oh, Elaine, I didn't mean...Now, let's see. Where were we ? Twelve. Twelve !Never mind about that. Just sit down.Now, tell me, who was the first one ?Why, you poor... You mean, he dropped dead right in this chair ?So ?Wait a minute !Come here, darlings. What about the others ? All twelve of them didn't walk in here and drop dead.Well, so, so...Wh... what?Mmmm ! Should have quite a kick.He did ? Well, wasn't that nice of him ?Oh no, darling, don't worry about the cake. I couldn't eat a thing.That'd be nice, darling, a sip of... A sip of wine !Wine !I'm beginning to think the cat's in on this.He's wonderful. Happy as a lark. Singing away, digging locks. He closes the cellar door.Got him working on a yellow-fever victim. Oh, I can see the headlines now : \u00abMurder Incorporator Rides Again\u00bb right across the front page. Let me see... Teddy ! Of course. Everybody knows he's crazy. Let me see. Who can I call up ? Dewey, La Guardia, Winchell ? No, Winchell's no good. Old Judge Cullman !I wonder if I got his number.What am I doing with tickets ? He throws the tickets on the desk. He picks up the phone, and starts dialing.Information... Hello ? Information ?... Get me the number of Judge Cullman on North Shore Road, Brooklyn. Yeah, would you call me back ?How it would be marvelous if he wasn't there.What are you doing here?Whistle ? Oh, yes, yes. I heard you whistle. But...Oh, you look fine, you look fine. Now, run on home. I'll call you up tomorrow.Yeah, you know I always call you up every day or two.Huh ? Taxi ? Huh, huh, huh ?Oh, Elaine, I'm so sorry. But something's happened.Oh, stop ! Don't whistle in my ear, please.Oh, my God, what color is it ? Quick ! Has it turned ?Oh, Elaine, if I could only tell you, Elaine. You smell so nice.Oh ! Oh !You better go home !All right, go home, go to bed, get some rest !Who ? Who ? Judge Cullman ?This is Mortimer Brewster. Look, Judge, I'll tell you why I called you. It's about Teddy.I've got to come over and see you right away. Oh, I'm afraid it won't wait until tomorrow, Judge. Yeah, you see, it's very, very important. We've got to do something about it immediately. But it's practically a matter of life and...Elaine ! Elaine, frightened, jumps up from the seat. Mortimer rushes to her.Will you get out of here ?Anywhere, but don't stand there !If it does, we'll let it !Oh, darling, I'm not throwing you out of the house !Will you get out of here ?I'm sorry, Judge. But... a thing happened. But, Judge, about Teddy, you see...Hold it. You see, Judge, it's his bugle blowing. Yes, the neighbors have been complaining, and the police are all set to throw him into a state institution.Well, I thought that if you sign the papers, I can get Teddy to commit himself, and get him in Happy Dale... Yes, it's a wonderful place, Judge... You will ?... Fine ! I'll be over right as soon as I've made another call.Yeah, operator ? Give me long distance, please.Oh. Hello, long distance ? I want the Happy Dale Sanitarium, Happy Dale, New York.Hello ? Hap...Well, operator...No, no...No, Happy Dale... Yes.Dale. \u00abD\u00bb like in \u00abdig\u00bb, you know, when you dig a lock. That's right. \u00abA\u00bb like in \u00abarsenic\u00bb. Got that ?I can see the headlines now. Oh, please. Hello ? Back to the table.Oh...Operator ! Well, I don't want the Happy Dale Laundry !

I could swim it faster ! Yes ! Hello ! Hello...What ?... What, they're busy ? Busy ? They're busy and you're dizzy ! No, I'm not drunk, madam, but you've given me an idea !Darling, don't \u00abah-ah ah-ah\u00bb, I'm nervous. Don't do this.Get out of here ! Do you want to be poisoned, do you want to be murdered, do you want to be killed ? Do you ?Look, you can't do things like that !Now I don't know how I can explain this to you, but it's not only against the law, it's wrong.It's not a nice thing to do. People wouldn't understand.He wouldn't understand. What I mean is... Well... This is developing into a very bad habit !Oh... Yes...Hello ?... Who ?... Oh, Happy Dale Sanitarium ? Oh, that's amazing, operator. Yeah... Happy Dale ? Oh, let me talk to Mister Witherspoon, please.Uh... uh... Well, Mister Witherspoon, do you... Oh, I'm fine, thanks. How are you ? Mister Witherspoon, do you remember that conversation we had about committing my brother Teddy to Happy Dale ?... You do ? Well, we want to commit him there immediately.No, but I'm going to attend to it right now and call you as soon as I have them. Thank you, Mister... What ?... All right. Thank you, Mister Witherspoon.Now listen, darlings. I've got to run over to Judge Cullman's, but, before I go, I want you to promise me something.Well, I love you both very much. And you know I'd do anything in the world for you, don't you ?All right, then I want you to do one little thing for me, like good girls.Don't do anything. I mean, don't do anything ! Don't let anyone in the house and leave Mr. Whosit right where he is. Oh ! Get off that thing. I can't talk to you... I can't concentrate.Now, look, darlings, I wouldn't want anything in the world to happen to either of you.Well, darling... Anyway, you'll do that little thing for me, won't you ? All right. Abby nods.Where's my hat ? There it is.What, darling, what ?Look, couldn't that wait until I get back ?Yes, darling, I could join you in the hymns. I'll sing with you, I'll dance with you, I'll do anything. But... remember, don't let anybody in the house until I get back. You promise ?Good.What ?Stop that \u00abuh-uh-uh\u00bb. What is it ?Ohhhh !...Yes ! Call me a cab !Don't open it. I'll sit with you !Sign right here, please, Judge. Excuse me. Right there.Yes, I know, we'd all be better off at Happy Dale. I sign here as next of kin, don't I ?Yes. Goodbye. Good luck, Judge. Thank you.No ! No ! Oh no ! Never tell them you've been lonely. Never !Judge ! Tell me, are you a drinking man ?Good ! Then you'll live longer.No ! No ! For heaven's sake, no wine ! No wine !Where's Teddy ? Is he upstairs ?Never mind that now, darling, please.What are you doing with your best clothes on ?Holy... What's that ? What's that thing there that looks like a cigar-store dummy ?Aunt Abby, didn't I tell you not to let anybody in the house ? Who did you say it was ?What ?\u00abI've come back home, Mortimer.\u00bb Listen, it talks !Wait a minute.Holy mackerel ! It is Jonathan !Yeah, I remember. How could I forget you ? Where'd you get that face ? Hollywood ?What ?Oh no, you don't, I'm staying here tonight. In fact, I'm staying here from now on.There's no room for anybody else in the house. Please, darling, just a moment. So take that little squirt and beat it ! Now where's Teddy ? I've got to see him right away. Is he upstairs ? He starts climbing the stairs.Nothing to...Window-seat ?Certainly not on the window-seat. I'm going to sleep on the window-seat.I'm going to sleep on the windows-eat from now on.Now look. Now look, Jonathan. Now, be a good fellow. Here's ten dollars. Go out and haunt yourself a hotel.Wait ! Who's this Mister Spenalzo ?Don't you bring anyone else in here.

Oh, Elaine, what are you doing here ?What's the matter, darling ?Killed ? Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha !Oh, that.I know, darling, I know.Oh, darling, don't worry about it. I'm here now. Now forget it.Window seat... Witherspoon. Darling, you'd better run along home.Yes, yes. Go home like a good girl. I got things to do.No, no, please. Hello ? Operator ? Get me Happy Dale 2-7-0, please.Yes, 2-7-0.Please ! This is important !Hello ? Oh, hello, Mr. Witherspoon ? This is Mortimer Brewster.Look, look, I...Wait a minute, I can't hear the man. What ? I've got the papers all drawn up. I know it's late, but I want you to come down here and get my brother immediately ! I's got to be done. Please, darling, please.Oh, the doctor ? Oh, holy mackerel ! I forgot the doctor ! Mortimer takes a piece of paper from the inside pockets of his jacket and puts it on the desk. Elaine is still whining at his side.Please, be quiet ! Can't you see I've got to get a doctor ? Hello ? What kind of a doctor ? A family doctor ?Thank you, darling. Thank you. Oh, look, why don't you come down here anyway ? While you're getting here, I'll get Teddy's and the doctor's signatures both.Yeah. Elaine ! Elaine ! Yeah, I'll get both signatures. Yeah, well, come right away.Elaine ? What's the matter with her ?Oh, dear !Elaine ! Elaine !Elaine !Oh, let me sit down. Let me think about this thing. Doctor, Teddy, signature...Hoskins !Ye gods ! There's another one ! He closes the lid and walks across the room toward the kitchen door.Aunt Abby ! Aunt Martha ! Come in here !No, you come in here now !Wait a minute. Didn't you promise me not to let anyone in the house while I was gone ?I don't mean Jonathan !And I don't mean Doctor Einstein ! Who is that in the window-seat ?He is not Mister Hoskins !There !You're trying to tell me you've never seen that man before ?Now, you look here, Aunt Abby. Don't you try to get out of this ! That's another one of your gentlemen, and you know it !You admitted to me you put Mister Hoskins in the window- seat.Well, this man couldn't have got the idea from Mister Hoskins !By the way, where is Mister Hoskins ?What ? You buried him ?A total stranger. Aunt Abby, how can I believe you ? There are twelve men down there, some you admit you poisoned them !\u00abA fib !\u00bbJon... Oh-oh... Ah-ah...Listen, handsome. I'm in no mood to debate the question. Are you getting out, or am I throwing you out on your ear?No. No, no, Aunt Abby, don't...Jonathan, let Aunt Martha see what's in the window-seat.Aunt Abby, darling, I owe you an apology.I've got some very good news for you. Jonathan is leaving. And he's taking Doctor Einstein and that cold companion with him. Listen, Jonathan. You're my brother, you're a Brewster. So, I'm giving you a chance to get away and take the evidence with you. You can't ask for more than that. Well ?All right, in that case, I'll have to call the police.No ! Come in.And glad to see you, fellow.Oh, come on. What's the hurry ? Why don't you stick around until my brother leaves.Yes, why ?No ?You are ?Well, well, well ! Maybe I can help you with it.You can't ?... Oh, I can spell like the dickens. Constantinople ? Come on, come on, let's go into the kitchen.You can tell me all about it. Couldn't you whip up a sandwich for Officer O'Hara ?See you in a moment.Now, listen, Jonathan, this is your last chance. I'll keep O'Hara busy in the kitchen and give you a chance to get out. All three of you : you, Doctor Einstein and Spenalzo.Now if you don't leave here in five minutes, I'll bring in Officer O'Hara, and introduce him to Mr. Spenalzo.I'll be right with you, O'Hara. Right with you. Right with you. Just give me one moment.Now get going ! All three of you.Oh, I don't know.Oh ? Legitimate ?Oh, excuse me.Well, you have ?Well, rehash it in your mind. I'll be back in a minute.I like the first act.No, I thought I told you... He closes the lid, kneels on the seat and looks through the open window.Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Jonathan !What are you two doing still here ? I thought I told you to beat it.You're not going ?You stay out of this. All right, you asked for it.Officer O'Hara ?Cellar ?What were you doing down the cellar ?No, no, no, no. You can't do that now. You'd better ring in.You know, you can't tell me in front of those two fellas, they wouldn't appreciate it.Let's go some place we can be alone. I'll meet you there later.Kelly's ?Oh yeah, fine place for Bohemian atmosphere. Genius at work.You ring in and I'll meet you at Kelly's.Fine.No, no, no. There's a much more literary atmosphere in Kelly's, I assure you.We'll meet laterYou will.Oh, the doctor !Yeah. Now, Look, you ring in and I'll see you later.No.Can't wait ! Can't wait !Doctor, doctor. Where are those papers ? Oh, there they are.Oh, oh-oh ! You're smug, aren't you? You think you've got it over me. But you haven't. You think I'm afraid to go to the police about Spenalzo because you've got hold of Hoskins. Well, I'm not !The moment I get Spenalzo... I mean, the moment the doctor signs this, I don't care who knows about him, Hoskins, I mean. And you better feel the same way about Spenalzo. Yes, Spenalzo !To the Doctor. Where do you... Oh ! Mortimer stops and starts running downstairs, and then to the front door.When I come back, I expect to find you gone. Wait for me !I'm a very lucky man to have caught you at home, Doctor Gilchrist.I'm sorry to have dragged you out of bed, but, you see, you're the only one who can help me.Oh, well, if only you had a little talk with him, I assure you you'd be convinced by him. Here's the house I...There goes Hoskins.What ? What ? Did I say... Oh, I...Now, you better wait.Yes, I'll bring Teddy out. Well, you see, I wouldn't want to alarm the old ladies, you know, seeing a doctor and everything. You wait here, huh ? He helps him finish tying his necktie.Yeah, that'll be good.Oh, don't worry about that. At Halloween, the pixies won't be out till after midnight. Now look, you wait here. Make yourself comfortable. Pull up a tombstone. I'll be right back.What ?Oh, yes, looks good on you !Yes, with a Maxim silencer.Oh no, thanks. It wouldn't fit me.Oh, Mister President, may I have the pleasure...Well, that's what he presumes. Mister President, the doctor would like to have a few words with you in private.Well now, that's that. It gives me a chance to rest.Well, so far, so good.Not so good.Oh, Elaine. Elaine, how can you say such a thing ? Darling, of course I love you.Yes, darling.Oh, Elaine.Elaine, Elaine, darling, I love you so much, I can't go through with our marriage.No, no, I don't think so, but it's only a matter of time. Now, look, darling, you wouldn't want to have children with three heads, would you ? I mean, you wouldn't want to set up housekeeping in a padded cell.Well, I don't quite know really. Look, I probably should have told you this before, but you see... well, insanity runs in my family.It practically gallops.Oh no, darling, no, no. It's way back before Teddy. No, this goes back to the first Brewster, the one who came over on the Mayflower. Yeah. You know, you know how in those days the Indians used to scalp the settlers ? Well, he used to scalp the Indians.Yeah.Well, even they have their peculiarities.No, no. I... Ohhh !Go away.Oh, papers ! Papers ! Yes.You will ?Ah, you see ? Didn't I tell you ?No. Don't worry about that. Just go on signing the papers. Oh dear. Thank you.Okay, thank you.Hello.Uh-uh ? Oh, I was getting some papers signed. Is Teddy in his room ?Police ! He quickly get back downstairsOh-oh-oh ! Wait-wait-wait ! You can't go for the police.Oh, darling, let him.Yeah, but I'll get them out, I promise you that !Yes, but remember, no police ! No police ! All right.There's a thing. Look, go to bed, will you ? Fine. Get out of those clothes ! You two look like a double blackout.No, no, no. Don't do that, Mister President.This must be secret.Yes, it's the only way we can outsmart the other fellow.That's the secret.Of course, Mister President.Oh, you already have them on, Mister President.Yes, what is it ? Mice ?Can't you see I'm busy ?Ta-ta-ta taaa !Thank you, Mister President. Oh, what a load off my mind. Boy, could I use a drink ! Thank God for that.Huh ? What did you say ? Speak up, sonny. I can't hear you.Stop underplaying. I can't hear you.Stop all this ! What are you doing ? Look, Doc. Are you really a doctor ?Heidelberg ? How'd you... How'd you come to hook up with Jonathan ?Tch-tch-tch ! Stop it, Doctor, now stop it !Will you stop it ? Now look, stop telling me about Jonathan, I'll take care of Jonathan, and you take care of yourself. Now, get going, little fellow.What's that ? What's that ? Wait a minute.I could use that. I could use that.Please. Only for dramatic critics. Now look, you beat it before things start popping around here.Oh, stop it, don't get me on the subject of plays ! I've got a lot on my mind now. I've got to wait here for Mister Witherspoon.Oh, you think so ? Did you ever see anybody in a play ever act like they got intelligence ?You ought to have my job a few nights. Listen to me, brother. When you get out of prison, you have yourself wheeled over to the Garrick Theater. Oh ! Oh ! There's a play there that's been running so bad that it'll still be running when you get out. Now, in this, there's a man... Now listen to this...Now, he knows he's in the house with murderers. So he ought to know he's in danger. He's even been warned to get out of the house. And does he go ?No, he doesn't. He stays ! This fellow doesn't even have sense to be scared or to be on his guard. No, no. The murderer even invites him to sit down. What do you think he does ?He sits down ! I remember what he did. He deliberately pulls up a chair like that and he sits down in it.Isn't that great ? So there he is, all waiting to be trussed up and gagged. What do you think they used to truss him up with ?The curtain cord.Seen him get it. No. The silly chump sits down with his back toward the murderer.All he has to do is look around, but does he ? No !No... Look, you see, brother Heidelberg, in a play or even in a movie, for that matter, ...a fellow never sees or hears anything. No. That's right.Oh, what does he do ? Well, the big chump sits there. This fellow's supposed to be bright. He sits there.Now get a load of this. Look, look at the attitude. Large as life ! He sits there waiting to be tied up and gagged. The big dope !Fight. Go on and fight.That's enough, that's enough. Everybody off.Amazing... Such a fine day, too. All I did was cross the bridge and I was in Brooklyn. Amazing. Amazing, amazing.Don't... Don't bother me now.Buddy, you could use this in the third act.I got the papers signed. There, they're all signed. What do I care ? Go ahead, go ahead, fight, fight, fight-fight- fight !I'd better call up and see if Witherspoon has left.Telephone. Hey !Yeah. A little higher, please, brother.Thank you very much. Yeah, that's fine. Jonathan suddenly realizes what Mortimer is doing and turns his head toward him. Brophy immediately comes behind him and hits him with his stick. Jonathan starts falling, and Mortimer has to pick up the telephone not to loose it.Oh ! Don't do that, please.Come on, doc... That won't have any effect. I've tried it before...Oh, it did. Dear me ! Isn't that amazing ?Oh, dear. Wish I could relax like that.Witherspoon !That's my brother !Thanks, pal.Huh-huh-huh !Usually, I'm Mortimer Brewster. But I'm not quite myself today.No, no, no arguments, Captain. No arguments. Just a minute, take it easy. Read this.Teddy's going to go to Happy Dale tonight. I'm just waiting here for Mr. Witherspoon.I know just how you feel.What's the matter ?Why not ?He what ?...Supposing the spy steals this document and finds the name Theodore Roosevelt on it. Think what that would mean to the safety of the nation !Oh, wasting the time.Let me explain. The name Brewster is code for Roosevelt.Yes, don't you see ? Take the name Brewster. Take away the \u00abB\u00bb and what have you got ?And what does a rooster do ?It crows! And where are you hunting in Africa ?There you are ! \u00abCrowsveldt\u00bb.Now, now, all I got to get is Witherspoon.Oh ! Oh ! Mister Witherspoon, I can't tell you how glad I am to see you. Mister Witherspoon... Before... Look... You will take good care of Teddy at Happy Dale ?Oh, that's fine. And no wagon when he leaves.Yes, look, it means a great deal to me. You will personally see that Teddy's happy at Happy Dale ?Oh, that's good.Oh, you do ? It must be a nice place. Because I've never been to Happy Dale.Oh, the woods are full of them.Oh ! A pamphlet about Happy Dale ?Captain ! Captain !... Captain !Captain, this is Mister Witherspoon. Witherspoon looks at Rooney with a smile.No, no, no-no, Mister Witherspoon, you got it wrong. This is... this is Captain Rooney.Mister President, I have good news for you. Your term of office is over.Practically.Who, Mister President ?No, no, Teddy this isn't Mister Taft. It's Mister Witherspoon, he's going to be your guide to Africa.It's all right, Aunt Abby, I've got it.Why-why... why not ? Why not, indeed ?Now, these two little sane people, mixed up with all the others, will get lost in the shuffle. You could arrange that.Just put them in and they'll get all mixed up.Oh-oh !Charge !Isn't that amazing ?Certainly there's thirteen bodies down in the cellar. And there are hundreds more up in the attic, Captain !I'll tell you what we'll do, Captain. I'll bring my bodies down from the attic and you get yours down from the cellar, and we'll get them all together, and we'll send them to Happy Dale.Sure, I put neon lights on mine.Humor them, humor them. Smile.Hasn't got it yet.Oh, you'd like mine better. None of mine are gentlemen.\u00abThere is a Happy Dale far, far away. There is a Happy\"He got it. It's amazing.Just the ladies, not me !A doctor... Oh ! Doctor Einstein ! Come here and sign some papers, please.Come here, Doctor Einstein.Oh, yes, yes. Doctor Einstein almost operated on me earlier this evening. Come on, Doctor.Here. Just sign right here, please, Doctor. Einstein signs the paper Mortimer gives him.

the theater every night.No, dear. It was Reverend Harper who sneezed. Bless you.We mustn't be angry with Mortimer. He's so very much in love with her. And Sister Martha and I are so happy about it. He used to come to see us only occasionally, and now, now he's in Brooklyn six nights a week.Oh, will you excuse me ?No, no, Teddy, dear. Thank you. I'll go.Oh, come right in, Mr. Brophy.Oh yes.May I welcome you to our neighborhood, Mister O'Hara.You know the Reverend Doctor Harper from the church next door ?The toys are on the chair up here, by the library door.Oh, Teddy, will you run upstairs and bring down your Army and Navy from Aunt Martha's room. They're all packed.How's Missis Brophy ?Well, I'll better get some beef broth for you to take to her.Oh, Stuff and nonsense ! I won't be a minute.Oh, Martha, you're back.Here's the broth for Missis Brophy. Be sure it's good and hot.Now, Teddy...Not at all.Oh, now, don't mention it.Good bye.Careful of the step here now with the toys.Goodbye. She closes the door, and goes back to her sister and Reverend Harper.Well...Bless you !Oh, no !Oh, do you remember, Martha ? She comes back to her sister and Reverend Harper.Once, a long time ago, we thought if he'd be George Washington, it might be a change for him, and we suggested it.But Mortimer's made all the arrangements for Teddy to go to Happy Dale Sanitarium after we pass on.Dear, sweet Reverend Harper.You know, Martha, I really do believe he's beginning to see the light.Yes. And dinner's going to be late, too.Teddy ?...Oh, Teddy, good news for you. You're going to Panama and dig another lock for the canal.Yes, dear. I just couldn't wait for you. I didn't know when you'd be back, and Reverend Harper was coming.Oh, I got along fine.No, no, dear. There wasn't time. And I was all alone.Martha, just look in the window-seat.Oh ! It's Elaine !What did she mean ? You don't suppose they've gone and...Oh, darling, how wonderful ! Oh, Martha, isn't it wonderful ? They're married!Yes, of course.Isn't it too, too wonderful ?But before you go, we can have our celebration. I'll open a bottle of wine and we'll sing. And we'll invite a few of the neighbors in.Oh, it's all ready. It's been ready since..Oh, dear. I do hope the Reverend isn't too angry. You know how your books upset him.You mean \u00abMind Over Matrimony\u00bb ?I hid them someplace...Now you behave. She goes away on her search.Oh, dear.There's a baby picture of your brother Jonathan.Just the thought of Jonathan frightens me. Do you remember how he used to cut worms in two with his teeth ?No ? Really?Oh, dear ! Abby goes into the kitchen.Happy bridegroom !Oh, yes, dear. That's after we're gone.Yes, we talked with Reverend Harper about it.No... When Teddy's working on the canal, you can't get his mind on anything else.Yes, dear. We know.Yes, but it has nothing to do with Teddy.Now, Mortimer. You just forget about it. Forget you ever saw the gentleman.We never dreamed you'd peek.He's a Mister Hoskins. Adam Hoskins. That's really all I know about him, except that he's a Methodist.No, dear. He died first.Oh, Mortimer, don't be so inquisitive. The gentleman died because he drank some wine with poison in it.Yes. And I put Mister Hoskins in the window-seat, because Reverend Harper was coming.Well, not at tea. That wouldn't have been very nice.Now, Mortimer, you know all about it and just forget about it. I do think that Martha and I have the right to our own little secrets.Well, we must do that, tomorrow or next day.No, they ought not to be allowed to make those pictures just to frighten people.Oh, the dears. Isn't Halloween a wonderful time for them ?Yes, dear. Mister Hoskins.Yes. You just should get stop worrying about it.Now, Mortimer, you behave. You're too old to be flying off the handle like this.Hoskins, dear.No, Teddy's down in the cellar now, digging the lock.Oh no, dear. This makes twelve.No, dear, because I remember when Mister Hoskins first came in, it occurred to me that he'd make just an even dozen.Oh, I was counting the first one, and that makes it twelve.Well, whatever is the matter with Mortimer today ?Mister Midgely. He was a Baptist.All his kith and kin were dead.And then, when his heart attack came, and he sat there dead in that chair, looking so peaceful. Remember, Martha ? We made up our minds, then and there, that if we could help other lonely, old men to find that same peace, we would.And then, you see, Teddy came up from digging in Panama, and he thought Mister Midgely was a yellow-fever victim. And that meant he had to be buried immediately.Oh, no, dear. Of course not !You know your Aunt Martha's knack for mixing things. You've eaten enough of her piccalilli.Yes, as a matter of fact, one of our gentlemen found time to say : \u00abHow delicious !\u00bbOh, you newlyweds! A sip of wine will give you an appetite.Doorbell's ringing, dear.Oh, how do you do ? Come in. The kitchen door has remained open, and we see Martha still working on her cooking.Yes... Do step in.Yes, I'm Miss Brewster.And this is my sister. Another Miss Brewster.Well, do sit down. I'm sorry, but we're just setting the table for dinner.Now, this would be a nice comfortable chair.Is Brooklyn your home ?All alone in the world ?Well, Martha....Well, you've come to just the right house. You sit down.The room's upstairs.Won't you try a glass of our wine before we start up ?Mortimer. Not that.Oh, piffle !Yes, dear.What do you want us to do ?But, what on earth could happen to us?Oh, and you could join us in the hymns !Mortimer !Uh-uh-uh-uh !...Mr. Hoskins' hat !Fancy getting nice Mr. Hoskins' hat all mussed up.No. Oh, well.Oh, I think I understand why he seemed so upset.He's just been married. I believe that always makes a man a little nervous.Oh, I'll go, dear.Are you sure ?Let me look.No, they're strangers to me.Who are you ? What are you doing here ?Oh no, you're not. You're nothing like Jonathan, so don't pretend you are. You just get out of here.Have, have you been in an accident ?Well, Jonathan, it's been a long time.Well, Martha, we mustn't let what's on the stove boil over.If you'll excuse us for a moment, Jonathan. Unless you're in a hurry to go somewhere.Well, I'm sure you both want to get to wherever you're going.No, Teddy. Not to Panama.I think, perhaps, you had better go to bed, Teddy. He and his friend want to get back to their hotel.This is not your home, and I'm afraid you can't stay here.Well, we're not going to let them spend more than one night in this house, for one thing. But what would the neighbors think ? People coming in here with one face and going out with another.Oh ! Mister Hoskins ! It can't be very comfortable for him in there. And he's been so patient, the poor dear. Well, I think Teddy had better take Mister Hoskins downstairs right away.Teddy ! Teddy, there's been another yellow-fever victim.No, Teddy, we must keep it a secret.Yes, a state secret.Well, Teddy, I think you'd better get back down into the cellar. And then, when I turn out the lights, when everything's dark here, you come up and take the poor man down to the canal. Now get along, Teddy.And we'll come down later and hold services.In the window-seat.Oh, my goodness! That's right, you were out. Well, you just come right along and see him now. You know, he's really very nice looking, considering that he's a Methodist.Jonathan, your room is waiting for you. You can go right up.Oh, but you must be very tired. Both of you. And we don't go to bed this early.Good night.I'll wait until you're up and then turn out the lights.I'll be right up.What's the matter ? What are you doing there ?We'll call the police.It's your brother Jonathan, and this is Doctor Einstein.It's your brother, Jonathan !Oh, don't you two boys start quarreling again the minute you've seen each other.Oh, no !He mistook her for a sneak thief.We're busy.Yes, dear, what is it ? Where's Elaine ?Jonathan just walked in.And Doctor...We told you. Mister Hoskins.Who can that be ?I certainly am. Well, this is a fine how-do-you-do ! It's getting so anyone thinks he can walk in this house !Mortimer, how can you say such a thing ? That man's an impostor. And if he came here to be buried in our cellar, he's mistaken.Yes, I did.Oh, no.He must have gone to Panama.No, no, not yet. He's just down there waiting for the services, poor dear. We haven't had a minute, what with Jonathan in the house.Oh, dear. We've always wanted to hold a double funeral. But I will not read services over a total stranger !Yes, I did. But you don't think I'd stoop to telling a fib ! Martha ! She enters the kitchen.Martha ! Martha ! What do you think has happened ?Martha, you come straight along here. You just look and see what's in that window-seat.I knew he was a foreigner.Oh...Oh, Officer O'Hara !No...Yes, do come in. She closes the door behind him.And this is another nephew, Jonathan.Well, Martha, I think we can start the services now.Oh ! We thought we heard you leave.A friend of Mortimer's ?Of course we do. And he's no friend of Mortimer's. He's one of our gentlemen.Besides, there's no room for Mister Spenalzo. The cellar's crowded already.There are twelve graves down there now.That leaves very little room and we're going to need it.Murdered ? Certainly not. It's one of our charities.So you just take your Mister Spenalzo out of here.All right ! All right ! We'll find out whose house this is ! I'm warning you, you better stop it. There's no use doing what you're doing, because it'll just have to be undone.It's a terrible thing to do to bury a good Methodist with a foreigner.Mortimer, where have you been ?Martha and I are going for the police.He's putting Mister Hoskins and Mister Spenalzo in together.Now, look. If Jonathan and Mister Spenalzo aren't out this house before morning, we're going for the police.Then you get the wedding silver.Oh, no-no, no, he can't go now ! We won't permit it.Mortimer, how can you allow this ? You promised.Well, if he's going, we're going, too !Our cellar ?But there are thirteen bodies in our cellar.Yes. You just ask our nephew, Mortimer.Now, Mortimer, you behave yourself. You know very well there are thirteen bodies down in our cellar.No, no, you wouldn't have to dig. The graves are all marked. We put flowers on them every Sunday.There's one down there, a Mister Spenalzo......who doesn't belong here and who's going to have to leave.You mustn't mind him at all. He got married today.Right here ?I'm really looking forward to going. The neighborhood here has changed so.Were you leaving, Doctor ?But Dr. Einstein !Mortimer. Mortimer, we're really very worried about something.Mortimer, will they investigate those signatures ?You see, you signed as next of kin.Well... Martha, you tell him now.Your mother came to us as a cook. And you were born about three months afterwards. And she was such a sweet woman and such a good cook, we didn't want to lose her. So brother married her. Your real father was a cook, too. He was a chef on a tramp steamer.I'm sure it won't make any difference to Elaine.Bye.They're going on their honeymoon.", "clean_line": "reverend harper hope disapprove mortimer dramatic critic takes
