Auto, why didn't you wake me for the morning announcements?Honestly, it's the one thing I get to do on this ship.Well, good morning everybody, and welcome to day 255,642 aboard the Axiom. As always, weather's a balmy 72 degrees and sunny, and -- Oh, hey, I see the ship's log is showing that today is our 700th anniversary of our five year cruise.

Define \"sea\".Define \"hoe-down\".Auto! Earth is amazing! These are called \"farms\". Humans would put seeds in the ground, pour water on them, and they'd grow food, like, pizza --Psst! Computer. Define \"dancing\".[Rocket noises] Prepare for landing... [Landing noises] We're here everybody! Yeah, Captain! [crowd cheers] Captain we're home! It's so beautiful! [crowd cheers]...No it's nothing.
