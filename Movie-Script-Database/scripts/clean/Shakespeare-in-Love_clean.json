Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started. You have begun?No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?God be praised! Locked?Who is she this time?!Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.. . . Will! What is money to you and me? I, your patron, you my wordwright! When the plague lifts Burbage will have a new Christopher Marlowe for the Curtain and I have nothing for the Rose.Fifty pounds? What for?Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!Where are you going?Now where? Will?Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?Is it about a pirate's daughter?You see? Comedy.Love and a bit with a dog, that's what they like.There's a lady knows your play by heart.What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?Oh, that.Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business. The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.I don't know. It's a mystery.If you wouldn't mindOh, it's coming, it's coming.Will! The theatres areRosaline? You mean Ethel.Yes, I heard. The theatres are open. But where is my playwright?Chalk it up, Nol. I'm hungry, too.Will! Have you finished?Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men are out on tour. I need actors. Those here who are unknown will have a chance to be known.It won't cost you a penny! Auditions in half-an-hour!Ralph Bashford! I'd have a part for you but, alas, I hear you are a drunkard's drunkard.Thank you.How refreshing.Thank you!Very good, Mr. Wabash. Excellent. Report to the property master.My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?It starts well, and then it's all long- faced about some Rosaline. Where's the comedy, Will. Where's the dog? Do you think it is funny?We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.Very well.Yes, but very well.Nobody. The author.It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.Is it?What? Who?The one who came with your letter?Juliet? You mean Ethel.A sonnet? You mean a play.You mean, no dog of any kind?That must be when he goes on the voyage and gets shipwrecked on the island of the Pirate King.Not with my props!We need that for the balcony scene!My poor Rose!I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre businessThe Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?By God, Will, if you do not, who does?

Was she weeping when she gave you this?Your aunt?Like a sickness and its cure together.Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself.Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks!

And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!Lady?Can you love a fool?Wait!

The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now.

Not for the Queen herself!To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.Then I will go with you.I know how to fight!Here we come at last, my lord!Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.

Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.Fifty pounds!What is this rabble?!A literary feud. Quite normal.Stay hid!I dreamed last night of a shipwreck. You were cast ashore in a far country.It is also a tavern.It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.By God, I wish I knew.Oh what have I done?It was I who killed him! God forgive me, God forgive me!It is worse. I have killed a man.Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.I was the more deceived.Now?Oh, my love You ran from me before.You cannot marry Wessex!No no.For killing Juliet's kinsman Tybalt, the one who killed Romeo's friend Mercutio, Romeo is banishedbut the Friar who married Romeo and JulietYou, Edward. The Friar who married them gives Juliet a potion to drink. It is a secret potion. It makes her seeming dead. She is placed in the tomb of the Capulets. She will awake to life and love when Romeo comes to her side again.I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead.And so Juliet takes his dagger and kills herself.The play. All written out for you. I had the clerk at Bridewell do it, he has a good fist for lettering.There's a new scene\"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.\"\"Yon light is not daylight, I know it, I.

Is she fertile?Is she obedient?I like her.My lady Viola.I have spoken with your father.\"Poet?\"By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?Two hours at prayer!Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.My lady VIOLA.I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.No. I have spoken to the Queen. Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday. You are allowed to show your pleasure.How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .It was your eyes. No, your lips.Will you defy your father and your Queen?She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.Not ready? Where is she?Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?!Now, pay attention, Nursy. The Queen, Gloriana Regina, God's Chosen Vessel, the Radiant One, who shines her light on us, is at Greenwich today, and prepared, during the evening's festivities, to bestow her gracious favour on my choice of wife--and if we're late for lunch, the old boot will not forgive. So you get you to my lady's chamber and produce her with or without her undergarments.By heaven, I will drag her down, by the Queen's commandAh! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!Are you bringing your laundry woman?On a more fortuitous occasion, perhapsNow?The Queen asks for you. Answer well.Is there a man?There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?That dog!Lady Viola is young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.Marlowe!You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.Bless me, I thought it was a horse.I understand of course. It is to be expected.And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soulOh, spare me, dear ghost, spare me for the love of Christ!Spare me!Shakespeare!You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell!By God, I'll fight the lot of youI rejoiced at his death because I thought it was yours. That is all I know of Marlowe.Close it!Close it! Take it down stone by stone! I want it ploughed into the ground, and sown with quick lime!My ship is moored at Bankside, bound for Virginia on the afternoon tide--please do not weep, Lady De Lesseps, you are gaining a colony.Would you oblige me with fifty or so in gold?--just to settle my accounts at the dockside?Ah!--Look, she comes!I will.Thank you.
