{"American-The": {"JACK": {"raw_line": "Nothing.A hunter.Go for help. Call the police.Blending in?I closed the Stockholm account.But there were complications.Collateral damage. Two shooters. Unidentified. [A beat] And a girl.Guess so.Since now.So.Buon giorno.America.Si. Il Americano.I'm no good with machines.Si.Poco.Not for much longer.Working vacation.Photographer.Pictures of the region. Architecture, landscapes...No people. Sights and landmarks. For guidebooks, magazines...Actually it's a syndicate. Lots of different publications. Um... Casa editrice.You're very kind, but I...Did I forget to mention my electromagnetic hypersensitivity?Who's the client?This is a small town, Larry. I don't like small towns. I grew up in one. Besides, I'm already attracting attention.I'll think about it.No.I take pictures, father.I try to, father.Un po' di formaggio, per favore.Questo.E un po' di pecorino.Prego. You're welcome.\"Amidst gathering clouds\".Una gelata alla fragola. Per favore.Edward.What car did they give you?Range?Time?Targets?Fire rate?Magazine capacity?You want a submachine gun to fit in a lady's purse?A small briefcase would be possible.X-rays? Camouflage: lap-top, DVD player, MP3 or digital camera?Noise?No such thing. You'll have to make do with a suppressor like everyone else. It'll dampen the decibels, dislocate the sound source and reduce muzzle flash. I can't make you silent but I can make you invisible as the Finnish phrase goes, but only as long as you're prepared to lose some range.Two o'clock.By the clothes stall. Light blue shirt, open at the neck, expensive buff suede shoes. Is he with you?You want a weapon with the firing capacity of a submachine gun and the range of a rifle.Give me a month. To trial. Then a week for final adjustments.Buon giorno.Il fermo posta?Clarke.Clarke. Una pacchetto.Grazie.Your source in Rome.I hope you paid below the odds. The more you pay them the more cops gossip in the locker room.Yet.Sinful.Have you ever wanted to be anything other than a priest?Photographer?I do what I'm good at.No.I'm not a young man. I have my savings.I don't think God is interested in me. Father.What are the snakes for, father?Sono un amico di Padre Benedetto.Buon giorno.I'm taking pictures forty minutes north of here. Right up in the mountains. Father Benedetto said you might be able to help.My publisher wouldn't stretch to a four by four and the park trails are playing havoc with my chassis.Not really. I just need something to work on a ruptured driveshaft.Just a hobby. I tinker.I appreciate that.Bene?Quant'e?Ciao. Grazie.E Clara qui? [Is Clara here?]Forse un altro tempo. [Perhaps another time.]I've got company.If he's not baby-sitting the Belgian contract then he's either a Joe, a cop or a shooter. He's not with The Company, they're fast: it's been three days and no TA. He's not intel: they're deep background and he wants to be noticed. He might be a cowboy but he can't be a cop: they work in pairs and he's alone. Strike Guarda di Finanza, State Police and NOCS: he's not Italian- he doesn't look like one, dress like one or behave like one. So who the hell is he?Larry?What's he waiting for?I can handle it.It's a bad line.Yes?The Carabinieri around here like roadblocks. It's cover.This attracts less attention.Fifty minutes.I'll wake you before the turn-off.The turn-off's up ahead.Just a precaution.Derelict. I checked three days ago.I'll check alone. There are adders the mountains. And vipers. Your shoes.Yes.You'd be out of a job.It's hard to like something you know nothing about.I've made up two sorts.Thirty lead and thirty jacketed.Not a problem.Will mercury do?Watch out for vipers.At least three hundred and sixty miles per hour. That's including twenty off the top for the sound suppression.Eight-two-one.You'll find it easy. I've re- balanced it for the longer barrel. The fulcrum is two centimetres forward of the grip now. Which won't matter if you're firing- and I'm guessing you are- from a fixed position.No major recoil issues. You should be able to hold onto any target. Even the smallest.Good shot.You'll upset the balance.Then I'm happy to oblige.A briefcase. Samsonite. Standard pattern in black with combination locks. Is there a number you'd prefer?Eight-two-one.Throw them in the lake.Aspirinio. Like Mosacata but frizzante.It wouldn't look right if the picnic wasn't touched.It had to be chilled. They're Italian cops.I'm paid to. Don't move.Parnassius apollo. It's endangered.It serves its purpose.No.I have an acquaintance.Wild boar.I'm much older than you. By the time you've retired I'll be dead.Hokey.Morboso?You needn't act.You might have to act with your other clients but you don't have to pretend anything at all with me.I want you to be yourself with me. Be as indifferent as you like. I came here to get pleasure, not to give it.I don't sleep with the other girls.Here?What did he want?Switzerland?And you told him?Shoulder holster.You're a true friend, father.Grazie.Buon giorno.I'm fine.It's nothing really. Just a broken rib. Un costollo rotta?I came off my bike.No, no, no. I have pain killers. I just need a strong cup of coffee.Why d'you call me that?How did he know I was here, Larry?I doubt it.How do you do?Will you take a coffee with me?Prego.Have you been to England?I am.Due cappuccini e un cafe corretto.If not with gold, than at least not with enough medieval cobbles to loosen every-self tapping screw in a Fiat.Where do you come from, Anna?Dove abita?Great. I'll see you then.How about our usual place?You've forgotten?Maybe we should try something different.Locanda Grapelli?Good.Seven.Locanda Grapelli.I'll be there.See you then, Clara. It was a delight to meet you Anna. Arrivederci.What makes you think I'm leaving?All men are sinners.I don't seek peace. I never have.Perhaps. Perhaps I'll stay. The valley. The villages. The mountains.I see a whore. She's young enough to be my daughter.Aren't all sins equal?Who says?Everyone's on the run from something.I've done nothing I didn't have good cause to do.For what reason?I make things. Artifacts.Why do you say that?You know a lot about me.And I should too?Fabio. The `car doctor'. Was he conceived here father?He looks like you. Even more than he does in the photos you keep of each other. Where was he conceived, father? Under one of these trees? At night? Like all the other bastards?Expecting me to reciprocate?I wasn't sure you meant me to.No, grazie.Small towns.It is. Very good.Sure.No.I doubt any of the couples here are. With the exception of the Germans at table seven. She's wearing a wedding ring and they haven't spoken a word to each other for eight and half minutes.What makes you think I have a secret? I'm an ordinary man. I cough. I fart. I earn a living.Why spoil the illusion?How is it?Bitchin'?No thanks.I will agree.It's bitchin'.Sure. Bastardo. Imbecile.Eat shit and die, pimple dick?I guess I've led a sheltered life. Of sorts.Too much work.For what?Never apologise.Mine too.Si.Retire.Liar.Would you be flattering me if I wasn't a client?Am I a client?Give it away.Grazie.Grazie, Clara.Where?I don't deliver, Larry. I never deliver. It's too dangerous. She comes to me. I know the town. That's what we agreed.Breach? What breach?Not possible.Cops?How come I'm still here?Where the hell's this information coming from?They don't.They can. They can trust me and so can you.I've never jeopardised an operation in my life.Put them in the back. We've got a way to go.Swimming.An hour. And we're not going to the sea, we're going to the lakes. In the mountains.A picnic.It is.Ten kilometres. Another twenty minutes.We're going off the beaten track.Lontano. Fuori mano.You shall see.There's no need to worry. I've been here before several times. Taking photographs.You're not afraid of coming into the wild with me, are you?This is a Citroen!This was made by the French for taking potatoes to market. Besides, I always come here in this car.Of course. I don't want to walk back to town any more than you do.I assure you it does.No. Not quite. We go another hundred metres, through the wood. But from here we just roll forward. No motor. No sound. And you'll see a wonder.You won't need to hold on. I'll go slowly. Just relax and look.No.Yes.There are vipers! Vipera! Marasso!If we stay here for a year, they'll devour us.Maybe we should...I haven't.Let's eat.Is Clara yours?Edward is my real name.Quite sure.Nothing.Dear Father Benedetto...I promised myself that I would write to you- as your friend- to say goodbye.Everything I've ever done...I've done for a reason.I never thought the day would come when I'd run out of reasons. Reasons to worry. Reasons to run. Reasons to pull the trigger.Maybe that day's come.Or maybe I've just found a reason to change.I still don't understand. What's the point of a gun if it's not loaded?Does the gun make you feel safer with me?Then why's it in your purse?Maybe this is suicide. Cops often put the graft on working girls. Perhaps the girl I told you about, Clara, has sold me out.I guess I'll go to work too.I can't stay here forever.It's not that I've given up on life, Father. Just the way that I was living it. If you can call it living.It's time to go home.I can't, Clara. One day...If I had one request, Father, it would be this. That it's not Clara who finally pulls the trigger. But whoever it is......by this time tomorrow I'll be dead.All there, as agreed.Sweets. For your journey.I guessed you'd have a sweet tooth.I suppose I'll read about this in the Times or the International Herald Tribune. Or Il Maessagiero.You never know.Sure. You?How do you know I'm retiring?CLARA!When can I see you?If I asked you would you come away with me?Why not?Together.Wherever. Then when we're through, we could come back here. For good.Where else?Forever.Unless you have other plans.I...Someone got what was coming to them.Go to your apartment and pack. Wait `till I get there. Don't answer the door to anyone but me.Trust me.Clara. My name is not Eduardo.My name is Jack.I promise. Take this.Look after it.
