{"Sweet-Smell-of-Success": {"SIDNEY": {"raw_line": "C'mon...C'mon...He wants me to break a leg?It isn't. I've just seen the early edition.But what?May I rent you out as an adding machine.Get me Joe Robard.Who else phoned?Pay the rent. Let the tailor wait.Watch me run a fifty yard dash with my legs cut off!Sidney, Joe. How do you like it? I'm running out of alibis! No, I asked Hunsecker to withhold the item, until he could give it a fine, fat paragraph. The column was running over and I didn't want you kissed off with just a line...Now, wait a minute, Joe. When I saw J.J. last night he said...Help me with two minutes of silence!Go home, Sally. It's late...Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books. And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?You ought to be used to me by now.No. You think I'm a hero. I'm no hero. I'm nice to people where it pays me to be. I gotta do it too much on the outside, so don't expect me to kow-tow in my own office. I'm in a bind right now with Hunsecker so -- Every dog has his day! Lock up and leave the key.If that's for me, tear it up!And leave a tip in every hat-check room in town?I've been up to here. Listen, honey, tell me something. You know Susan Hunsecker...? Has she been in? I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?You're sure. Find out for me.Is Frank D'Angelo around?Your nephew doesn't want a drink.And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.See my mother?Robard's my client. I did it for him and his club, not your boys.Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?You told him that?When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?That's a nice tour. All booked? When was Susie around here last?Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.If you knew Hunsecker as well as I did, you might understand why it's my business. Maybe you're walking around blind, Frank, without a cane....and in case you didn't know it, Susie Hunsecker's out there on the back step right now.Hi, Fellows. Where's the Chief?Dallas. Is he around?Thanks.Can more than two enjoy this joke... Hello, Susie, I didn't expect to find you here.Where's those glossy prints you promised? Tonight's the latest I can place them -Let me apologize for getting you that press spread. It's been an honor to serve you gratis.Kill me! Find me a door somewhere - I walked in without knocking!Begging your pardon, I haven't been down the bowery in years!If you're going home, Susie, I'll drop you off...Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?Avidly. He was staring.He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?You were thrilled to be interviewed. Were you \"interviewed\"?And where was his wife?We're old friends, Chickie - quit it! A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter! What did you think would happen in his house?That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...Can you be there by two-thirty?I wasn't looking for a brawl. I came to bring him a present. Wanna bite to eat?Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?We stick in each others craw.Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J. is some kind of monster.Susie, your brother's one of my best friends, and -Where do you come off to make a remark like that?Frankly, yes, to my surprise. He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.You feel pretty strong about this boy?Wedding bells, you mean?Well, congratulations. But don't go just for the ride! Or didn't you accept the proposal?Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!Why should he put on an act? Your brother has told PRESIDENTS where to go and what to do!Wait for me. I'll be right back.It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll talk to you like an uncle...No, I mean because I admire you - in fact, more than admire you - although that's neither here nor there. Susie, don't sell your brother short. Talk this over with him, I mean - you'll find him a real friend.Any message, in case I see J.J. later?The Twenty One Club.Jimmy! This is a coincidence. I am just going -I tried to reach you twice -Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker. I can promise you -Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -No more you don't! What is this - You're showing off for her? They're supposed to hear you in Korea?If you're funny, James, I'm a pretzel! Drop dead!Is \"he\" inside?Alone or surrounded?Honey, get me Mr. Hunsecker.So it isn't Long Distance.J.J.? It's me --J.J., it's Sidney. Can you come outside for one minute?I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.Can I come in for a minute?J.J., I need your ear for two minutes...I have a message from your sister.Last July, the lead item...Sidney Falco, sir. And, of course, everyone knows and admires you, Senator Walker.I know Manny Davis.Do you believe in capital punishment, Senator?A man has just been sentenced to death...Not just this minute, J.J....You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.Sure, columnists can't get along without us. Only our good and great friend, J.J., forgets to mention that. We furnish him with items -You print them, don't you?I didn't say that, J.J.There's your fat friend.I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.Spahish...that must show he likes \"spigs\", too.You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.Why not break it up yourself? You could do it in two minutes flat.Frankly, J.J., I don't think you got the cards to blitz me.Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...About a year ago, you asked me to do a favor. It was a thing - well, I never did a thing that dirty in all my life.Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. \"Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here.\" Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE! WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...No, lemme finish. I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB! That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head. And Susan, like you said, she's growing up. Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me wrong - in for a penny, in for a pound. I'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head. Let me make a living!Excuse it, but it's later than you think. That boy proposed tonight.Uh huh.Tonight. Before you go to bed. The cat is in the bag and the bag is in the river.Just hopping tonight. Leo Bartha been in?Thanks, I see him...Hello, Leo. How goes that Sunday piece on cigarette girls?The cigarettes girl...Rita. And she took out all her hairpins, too.I never had the pleasure of meeting your wife. You know what I wonder, Leo? Could you use a hot little item for tomorrow's column?Leo, I've never had the pleasure of meeting your wife...All the imported wines aren't what they're cracked up to be.Frankly, Mrs. Bartha, I'm a neutral observer for the United Nations.Sidney.No, I actually sat down to give Leo an item.Just in case you'd like to print it, Leo. It's a blind - no names mentioned. But for your private information, the guy's name is Dallas.Anything there with a name like \"cigarette girl\"?Neither does Hunsecker. He likes to use the real names...What are you talking about? Are you nuts or what?What do I do now? Whistle \"The Stars and Stripes Forever?\"I'm late for a date with a dame.Otis, if you're trying to blow this brawl into an item for your column - forget it!Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims! Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy! That's what the fight with Bartha was about. \"Leo\", I says, \"Hunsecker froze me out. So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item.\"I see you're full of human feelings......and two miles for a pretty girl...?This is how much I'm washed with J.J....Look, Otis, I make no brief for my bilious private life, but he's got the morals of a guinea pig and the scruples of a gangster.A kid named Dallas, who runs a dinky jazz quintet. He keeps company with J.J.'s screwball sister...It's a real goody if, like me, you wanna clobber J.J.!He's got his TV tomorrow. He'd read it just before rehearsals.Suppose I introduce you to a lovely reason, Otis. One that's good and bad...and available?Waiter! The check.Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.Otis was outraged when I told him Van Cleve was going to fire you. Tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what. Right, Otis?I thought you two could talk the whole thing over till I got back.One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.Now, Otis...Give me a chance --Don't you know who that man is?Yeah!So take five minutes! Get acquainted! He's an important man - he's lonely - don't be dumb!What kind of an act is this?I beg your pardon! I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy. Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!What sort of thing?Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you! And so do I! I need his column--tonight. Didn't you ask me to do something about your job? Don't you have a kid in Military School?Honey - he's going to help you! You want to lose your job?Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!Nothing I didn't think of you before.How many snorts does it take to put you in that Tropical Island Mood?Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now. See you two kids later!Don't do anything I wouldn't do. That gives you lots of leeway.It would be nice if you mentioned R-O-B-A-R-D - Robard's jazz joint -- it's his 20th anniversary. Don't begrudge it to me, J.J. - I owe him lots of favors. I think you understand, don't you, that the Dallas skull is badly dented? Oh, real bad... starting today, you can play marbles with his eyeballs. Don't hold out on me, J.J., mention Robard. R.O. -Gimme The Record.Hello, Mary, me darlin' and phwat are ye up to today?What about?Sally? I got the message. If D'Angelo calls again, tell him I'll be at the office around noon.Dallas? Could be. He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...Can it be news to you that J.J.'s ceiling needs a plaster job every six weeks?Mary, I'm not \"people\" - there's Falco blood, sweat and tears in that column.How about dinner tonight?And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?Mary, don't try to sell me the Brooklyn Bridge. I happen to know it belongs to the Dodgers.Who put this item in about the comic? \"If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name. We were too busy screaming.\" Does this Temple have a press agent?What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?Herbit Temple here yet?I'm in, Sonny Boy!Hiya, Al!How do you do, Mr. Temple...I'm Sidney Falco.Temple, I caught your act the other night and -- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.No, I don't mind. I'm busy too.But can I ask one impertinent question here? With no criticism intended, because I know, Al, you earn your ten percent, how come you let a sock act like Herbie Temple tip-toe through town without a publicity build...?I'm not selling. I'm just curious, that's all.Take your hand off, lump! No one believes in press agents, Temple, when they make claims they can't perform. I got nothing to sell - I didn't come here to peddle - but if I tell a client that Hunsecker will give him space, it's not just talk!Hello? Mary, let me speak to J.J., please...it's Sidney Falco...Tell him it's important...Sure, I'll wait...Relax, lump! I told you I'm not selling fish... J.J...Sidney!...How are you, sweetheart? Yeah... Listen, I know it's late, J.J., but is it too late to add something important to the column? No, not a relative, but important...Yeah, if you got a pencil there I'll suggest a word or two. Uh...uh...If there's a funnier man in the world than Herbie Temple at the Palace...uh...pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing. No, make that 'screaming'. It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks. Probably see you at Twenty One tonight. No, for supper, late. Right. 'Bye...See me in my office.I don't like a guy that's quick with the hands. Temple, you've been three passes behind for twenty years. This could start you off big - T.V. and anywhere.You tell him, I stutter!Wait as long as you like - you know where my office is.What is here, a wake?It's a habit with me. So now I'm briefed. So what?Why me...?That's your idea of logic? I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, \"Why not you?\"Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife. So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?According to you, yeah. Dallas, your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty! I don't like you, comma, but neither do I go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the Reds. Also, since we're talking repulsive, J.J. won't like this for two cents! Don't give me that look, Dallas - J.J. believes in fair play. And secondly, this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication - your her boyfriend!Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya? How do you like it? He comes to my office and -Should I cry...?Then what are you doing here? Go over there and fight! If Van Cleve fires your boy, it gives a lie the ring of truth!What are you calling her for...?What are you looking at...?Tell him.What's the matter?You know, Sally, sometimes I get the impression you think you live in Star-Bright Park. This is life, kid - get used to it!Nikko, is Mr. Hunsecker there? This is Mr. Falco. Well, have him call me as soon as he can. It's important.Did you send my folks in Philly the check...?I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...Don't judge a situation where you don't know what's involved...That's no way to talk...Stay down town tonight. Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.You see? Hunsecker's gotta phone ME!Hello, J.J....I presume you saw the Elwell smear. No, no medals - not yet. Oh, it's worse than that - Aunty Van Cleve is firing them...from the horse's mouth... They were just here - in a panic...J.J., peace on earth, good will to men - it's working out just the way I planned. Yeah, I guarantee this bomb will pop right on schedule, but you have to play your part - you be a Saint and let me be the Devil. But I wanna talk to you first...Chickie, a lotta people think they're smart. You watch. They're dumb: they'll do the work for me! Just watch.J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet.I know Steve. No.J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!Get Steve back his job...please...Yes. With your \"prestige\" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.I read your column every day...No, I won't...I'm not sure I can reach him in time.With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.Can't hurt...I like that, too. Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion. We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze. Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor! The manager yes, but not the boy.Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!Presumably yours... That's according to St. Dallas.Integrity - acute, like indigestion.A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match! It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's \"integrity\".Calculated risk. Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me. I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.Hey, Susie - This is a real surprise -- not one but three. J.J.'s just finishing up his rehearsal.Yeah, she's had a peck of trouble for a kid...Frank, you don't listen! J.J. just told you to shut your mouth!Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line! What about that big rumpus in my office today? You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!Wild? Take a look at them and see who's wild...Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!You did it, J.J., you did it good...I'll get you a cab...J.J. asked me to drive you over and -Susie...!My mother's side--her brother. That reminds me, J.J., Susie looks run down. She can stand a vacation and so can you. People say, \"Oh, the great J.J., he's made of iron!\", but you can use a rest, guy.But not for anything I did today...You're right, J.J. - she won't give him up, but it doesn't matter. Because the real \"money ball\" is the boy, not Susan. And if --Yeah, the boy...we're on the verge of a farce, a real farce. As I see it, if Susie had stood behind him today he might have proved a threat. But since primarily he's wedded to his work, he's not going to be able to take it.In brief, J.J., it's all over because any hour now the boy will give her up. Is it a farce or not?How does it matter who's sister? The main thing, they're through and -J.J., is he worthy of a second glance from a man like you? Is he, I mean?...Steamship tickets?That's good. Now that louse is outa Susie's hair for good.Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms? Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow...Why give her real proof? You nearly ruined her with her first husband - and you were right, J.J., - but she almost followed him out the window. What do you want - a chronic invalid?Why, what's tomorrow - a holiday?I think I'll go home - maybe I left my sense of humor in another suit.I'm leaving, J.J....J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.Except, if you'll excuse me, I'm not in jail.J.J. If you're trying to -A little hunch occurs to me - you have just painted a self-portrait. You know who YOU are because you scare people - that's what you've got against this boy. He -You're blind, Mr. Magoo. This is a crossroads for me. I won't get Kello. Not for a life-time pass to the Polo Grounds. Not if you serve me Ingrid Bergman on a plate.J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it. If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...He's leaving early. After this \"set\". He'll be out in a couple of minutes...Can't you wait up the block? It's not going to look so good, right in front of the club...- He's got them on him.Take your hands off, Kello...Sleep in peace, Kello -- you're skinny -- but J.J. says you sweat!He goes out with girls.Go out with DIFFERENT girls!You could be right, you fat slob?A bunch of nickels, mister!A double Johnny Walker Black. Or whatever you got. Scotch.Susan?Where's J.J.?But he called and said...It's all over town about Dallas... How is he?Susie, if I get your meaning, you're pitching very wild balls. What -Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day. Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.Come on now, chickie, why don't you go to bed...?What ship?Honey, I'll just have to smile at that.It's late and I'm going home...Susie, whatever problems you have with J.J. - I didn't invent them! What're you blaming me for? If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!Yeah! Like me! I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back! Let THEM choke, not me!I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for? Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?I didn't do anything!Don't run away - I was always the man for you! I'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what I say! Inside of six months -Listen to me, lunatic! All your life you've been doing penance for crimes you never committed! I could change that, I'd teach you, I'd show you - !She was depressed - she heard about Dallas.J.J., if you think -I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -Look, J.J., I'll grant you anything you want. Susie's off her rocker tonight! Go in and see what she's doing! Go in and talk to her quietly - unless you want a corpse!Susie! SUSIE!Talk to her yourself...You're unholy, J.J.! You'd rather kill this girl than let her go!Susie, YOU get out of this house! - Get out before it's too late!Listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know I'm telling you the truth!Susie, there's nothing wrong with Dallas! Your brother and I arranged it all. And if the Leslie boy is still a squooshy item in your life, forget it! - your brother arranged that one, too! I don't usually give away presents; but this is my gift to you: Get out of here! Leave this man!Yes, he's sick and you're the only idiot alive who didn't know it.But what are you going to do?You don't owe your brother a cup of water!What are you going to do?For Pete's sake, straighten out the seams of your stockings - comb your hair - don't be so helpless all the time!Hello, Harry...I thought he would.", "clean_line": "mon mon wants break leg isn ve seen early edition

Paul.Full house...?Steve...I'll...I'll try to make a good wife.Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted. He isn't perfect, but -Let's forget him and -Darling, I don't care - really I don't. Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -Steve, dear, please forget all of this. What can it matter after tomorrow?If the stores are open -And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer.I made you write a beautiful song...Steve, stop it please...You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...Not to me. Sometimes, the world feels like a cage. Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again... I wish you and Steve could like each other.Yes, but why?Don't you?I know. But someday I'd like to look into your clever mind and see what you REALLY think of him -Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?He wants me to go on the road with them. It's an eight month tour, all the way to Oregon...I'm going to discuss it with J.J. in the morning.It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.The act would be for my sake, not Steve's...But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.Yes. Tell him for me that Steve Dallas is the first real man I've ever been in love with...A smear?...What...What kind of smear...? Where are you?Why?Did Sidney tell you about it?No, I'm not. I'm not!History repeats itself. Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...Then whose fault was it, J.J.? It was someone's fault, wasn't it?Alan was not...unbalanced when I married him. And he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said!He never would have killed himself if I hadn't gone through with the annulment. Don't you see that made all the rumors seem true? I should have stood up for him...not run out.Sidney is a liar!I said Sidney!...I thought we were talking about Sidney?I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -I'm taking up the situation with you now...When I'm certain, I'll let you know...Steve, before we go in - I'd like to...Steve, you remember my brother...J.J., Steve isn't...No...Steve, if only for my sake, I want this stopped! And the same goes for you, too, J.J.!Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...No. I'm going home.I'll never see him again.Get away from me.I told you to leave! I don't know if Steve'll ever talk to me again and I'm ready to blame it all on you!Good evening, Mr. D'Angelo.Hello, Steve. I'm glad you could come.Would you buy me a cup of coffee? In there...Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you... Will you forgive me? Have I lost you, Steve? Have I...?No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.Steve, I...You're saying goodbye, aren't you?But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time! I was born only yesterday!...Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?You are saying goodbye, aren't you...?No, Steve, I don't. I don't. Not if it KILLS me I don't!...Let's not talk any more...you have to go...Goodbye, Mr. D'Angelo. Take care of Steve.Say something funny...Mr. Hasenfeffer.No. Mr. D'Angelo - is something wrong?Seldom before five. What's the matter? Would you care to come in a minute?Something's happened. To Steve.Where is he...I want to go to him...Who is \"they\"?He isn't here...No, I called...Mr. D'Angelo phoned about Steve...I went down to the hospital, but they wouldn't let me in. He promised to keep in touch with me - Mr. D'Angelo, I mean...He's...unconscious...I...I gave Steve up... Why did you and J.J. do it?Don't bother to lie, Sidney. I don't care anymore.I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother. To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.THIS ship.Don't you know how my brother will see you after tonight? You'll be the man who drove his little stainless sister to suicide... REVERSE ANGLELike you?I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love......but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -I called him.Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...No! NO! Don't touch me!Go away!...Go away!...GO AWAY!Yes...yes...yes...Steve...is out of danger...Yes.He's sick.Go to Steve.I'm leaving, J.J.", "clean_line": "hello chico paul house steve ll ll try good wife steve day tell brother telling morning breakfast steve brother isn bad painted isn perfect let forget darling care sidney secret crush years business steve dear forget matter tomorrow stores open tuesday hasenpfeffer write beautiful song steve stop touchy sidney touchy world feels like cage comes opens door monday night wish steve like yes know someday like look clever mind think love man keeps jumping burning hoops like trained poodle think likes steve wants road month tour way oregon going discuss morning given big lift know people want brother sister hope likes steve isn act act sake steve need uncle sidney yes tell steve dallas real man ve love smear kind smear sidney tell history repeats happened alan leslie began smear like ve seen ghost today fault fault wasn alan unbalanced married indifferent women matter said killed hadn gone annulment rumors true stood run sidney liar said sidney thought talking sidney haven said taking situation certain ll let know steve like steve remember brother steve isn steve sake want stopped goes think men fools going home ll away told leave know steve ll talk ready blame good evening mr angelo hello steve glad come buy cup coffee steve tried today tried high mountain couldn way failed forgive lost steve stood brother way think antagonize steve sake mean steve saying goodbye aren steve step time born yesterday steve feel exhausted want saying goodbye aren steve kills let talk goodbye mr angelo care steve funny mr hasenfeffer mr angelo wrong seldom matter care come minute happened steve want isn called mr angelo phoned steve went hospital wouldn let promised touch mr angelo mean unconscious gave steve bother lie sidney care anymore sorry steve sorry brother lonely real friend world hang worthless rag girl like real family sorry sidney going ship ship know brother tonight ll man drove little stainless sister suicide reverse anglelike man sidney forgive steve came jealousy love greed sidney pathetic sidney stand called explain sidney matter touch away away away yes yes yes steve danger yes sick steve leaving"}, "HUNSECKER": {"raw_line": "Can I come out? No.You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.No. You're dead, son - get yourself buried!I'll check it in the morning, Low - thanks.Harvey, I often wish I were dead and wore a hearing aid...with a simple flick of a switch I could shut out the greedy murmur of little men...Mac! I don't want this man at my table...Forgive me, Harvey. We were interrupted before -Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.Now don't kid a kidder.Everyone knows Manny Davis... ...except MRS. Manny Davis.Yes? Go ahead, Billy - shoot...Uh huh. Sports cars in California are getting smaller and smaller...the other day you were crossing Hollywood Boulevard and you were hit by one...you had to go to the hospital and have it removed... You're not following the column: I had it last week.Manny, what exactly are the UNSEEN gifts of this lovely young thing that you manage...?What subject?Why \"of course\"? It might, for instance, be politics...The brains may be Jersey City, but the clothes are Trainor-Norell.How did you guess it, Miss James?Mr. Falco, let it be said at once, is a man of FORTY faces, not one, none too pretty and ALL deceptive. See that grin? It's the charming street urchin's face. It's part of his \"helpless\" act - he throws himself on your mercy. I skip the pleading nervous bit that sometimes blends over into bluster. The moist grateful eye is a favorite face with him - it frequently ties in with the act of boyish candor: he's talking straight from the heart, get it? He's got about half-a-dozen faces for the ladies, but the real cut one to me is the quick dependable chap - nothing he won't do for you in a pinch. At least, so he says! Tonight Mr. Falco, whom I did not invite to sit at this table, is about to show in his last and most pitiful role: pale face with tongue hanging out. In brief, gentlemen and Jersey Lilly, the boy sitting with us is a hungry press agent and fully up to all the tricks of his very slimy trade!Match me, Sidney...I know - that loafer of yours opens at the Latin Quarter next week. Say goodbye, Lester!Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee? He's trying to take you off the hook.Heaven dust.What, some cheap, gruesome gags?Yes, with your clients' names attached. That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world! Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!The day that I can't get along without press agents' handouts, I'll close up shop, lock, stock and barrel and move to Alaska.Look, Manny, you rode in here on the Senator's shirt tails, so shut your mouth!This man is not for you, Harvey, and you shouldn't be seen with him in public. Because that's another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space.We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?Maybe it's a mannerism - because I don't threaten friends, Harvey. But why furnish your enemies with ammunition? You're a family man. Someday, with God willing, you may wanna be President. Now here you are, Harvey, out in the open where any hep person knows that this one......is toting THAT one......around for you......Are we kids or what?...Next time you come up, you might join me at my TV show.Go, Thou, and sin no more.Mac, don't let the Senator pay that check...President! My big toe would make a better President!Find me a good one, Joe.Dan, anyone calls, tell 'em I'll be at the Morocco, maybe the Embers.Where's your coat, Sidalee? Saving tips?My curiosity is killing me; what are you so rambunctious about tonight?Hello, Harry.You see, Sidalee, that shows that Lt. Kello likes your people.Harry, am I supposed to say \"uncle\"?Anything fit to print, tonight? Hello, Phil. How're the kids.Any news fit to print tonight?Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night. Still alive?She mighta jumped. Love suicide? Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.Say hello to Sidney Falco. Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!I remember ONCE when you didn't quite \"put things together\". Boy! Was the Mayor mad!That's show business. Thanks, Phil. See you.I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.I love this dirty town.Conjugate me a verb, Sidney. For instance, TO PROMISE!You told me you'd break up that romance - when?I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.At this late date you need explanations...? Susie's all I got - now that she's growing up, I want my relationship with her to stay at least at par! I don't intend to antagonize her if I don't have to. Now, be warned, son - I'll have to blitz you...I don't?I'll listen one more minute.Are you finished?Not \"we\", Sidney, you!Ha! My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!What you promised - do it! Don't finagle around. It's later than you think.Susie told you that...?No wonder you've been so 'feisty' tonight.Can you deliver?When?Don't be a two time loser, Sidalee. The sentence could be severe...Yes...? You sound happy, Sidney. Why should you be happy when I'm not? I'll see the papers when I get up. How do you spell Picasso, the French painter? It's an item - I hear he goes out with three-eyed girls.We shall see what we shall see... And don't ever use this apartment phone again; I have a nervous sister.Who was just there? You'll be the death of me. Sidalee! Why? Didn't you just tell me that they've already traced this smear to you? All they have to do now is to put two and two together and I'm a chicken in a pot!Don't come here. Susie is up and about. He called her? You'd better see me at the TV - three o'clock.The table can wait. No calls. I have to think about my TV show.Did you put the bread out on the terrace for the birds?Susie! Come in a minute, dear...Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...Yes, he phoned. I don't know this boy too well. Anything in these charges?Not being partial, are you?Susie, take it easy. I'll trust your judgment - you don't have to protest with me.Why are you trembling, dear...?Yes...But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie. I've told you that a million times...I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...I'm not fighting with you, puss...You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?Susie, you're sure there isn't some fire where there's this much smoke?Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?Who said Sidney?You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.Let me finish, dear. You had your say, now let me have mine...I started to say we're drifting apart. A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me? Today I had to call you in!Susie, I want to help you--, there's nothing I won't do for you. You're all I've got in the whole, wide world.Well, what have I got? Alimony to a pair of tramps? They're of no concern to me. It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again!How?He means that much to you...?You're picking up my lingo, hon.Susie, I like this new attitude of yours. You're growing up and I like it! I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward. This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world. Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...?This Dallas boy must be good for you. Why not bring him around today, before the show? This time I'll clean my glasses for a better look.Sure you can if you want to, and I know you'll want to... By the way, what's your beef against little Sidney?A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake. Let me have Billy Van Cleve... Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings... Billy! J.J.! What's this about that boy? What boy? Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!... No, don't explain your point of view, but...\"I was reminded of it this morning, when I noticed that the birds had gone South. We want the same kind of freedom for ourselves - that's what the man said! A man has the right to face his accusers! That's the American Way! Who said? The man said! From...\"Burton, don't stand around. If I go over I'll cut some items off the tail...\"From Washington through to Jefferson, from Lincoln and F.D.R. right up to today - the Democratic Way of Life! That's what the man said! Nowadays it doesn't export to well... But you know...and I know...that our best secret weapon is D-E-M-O-Of course, Mildred. Of course. You look fine. Mary, help Miss Tam - anything she wants; she's our star today.I got that boy coming over here. What's so funny?I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.Can't hurt? I had to get him back his job.But it's too late. I got him back the job...Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!And who's feet is she on now?What's this boy got that Susie likes?What does that mean - integrity?Full of beans, ain't you? But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...I wouldn't like to take a bite of you; you're a cookie full of arsenic.Looks like a wedding.Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...Give Susie credit for that. I took her word that there was nothing to the smear. Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today. That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.I'll by that, son. Now, you owe ME a favor. Be good to my kid sister...Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets. But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son? Not just tom-catting around...I hope?Take it easy, Susie. He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern. Would you, son?Serious as a deacon...I like it. I like your style, son! In a world of old rags and bones, I like it! For instance, take Sidney.If Sidney got anywhere near Susie I'd break a bat over Sidney's head! Sidney lives so much in a moral twilight that, when I said you were coming here, he predicted disaster. You wouldn't take my favor -- you'd chew up the job, he said, and spit it right back in my face! Any truth in that...?Don't amplify.Why, has he bothered you before?Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.Just exactly what are you so hot about? I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --Well, just be careful you don't knock her down, huh?Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill. Just give us the punch line...Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?Don't go wild, Sidney.What about that...?How did you mean it...?Both of you keep quiet! You've made more damage here in one minute than a plague of locusts! If you're tired, Susie, sit down--- this needs investigation! How did you mean it...? Come on, let's go! Let's go!...Right now you're in no position to ask questions! And your snide remarks---Susie, did you know about this accusation...?Before you leave, son, I'll answer your question---Susan Hunsecker is the injured party here! Or will I be hearing next that I don't even have my sister's welfare at heart...You hear that, Susie... Continue please...That's stout of you, Dallas, but Susie may not care to air her dismal views in public...Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks. Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.May I lift my eyebrows? What is this? What are you trying to do?Son, you raise your voice again and you'll be outa here on your golden pratt!Susie, I'm sorry if---You see, Dallas, a plague on both our houses... We may have to call this game on account of darkness...If looks could kill, I'm dead...And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately? Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.Son, I don't fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns. So suppose you just shuffle along and call it a day...Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?Want Sidney to drive you over?Drive Susie home.Susie...I...I'd have to take it very much amiss if you ever saw that boy again.Call Van Cleve. Tell him he was right. Tell him I said the Dallas boys are not worthy of his club.Mary...for Susie's own good...don't give her misplaced sympathy...So that's what \"integrity\" looks like. Well, I'm always willing to learn... How is that slob, D'Angelo, your uncle?What are you so chipper about? If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!Sidney, I know human nature. Susie lied to me - she'll see that boy again.These drinks are warm.What are you a critic?Forget it. The real money ball is the boy...Stop tinkering, pal - that horse radish won't jump a fence!This syrup you're giving out, Sidney, you pour over waffles, not J.J. Hunsecker! What do you mean that lousy kid will give up my sister?Are you listening?Am I supposed to forget how that boy talked to me today?Brief epitaph: \"The boy was talking when he should have been listening.\" Bite on this.For the next sailing of the Mary. Susan's run down - she's never been abroad and as you so cogently put it, I'm not made of iron.I want that boy taken apart.She knows now.I know how to handle Susie. You just handle the boy, Sidney... ...preferably tonight.You've got that God-given brain - learn to use it! Do you think it's a personal matter with me, this boy? Are you telling me I see things in terms of personal pique? Don't you see that today that boy wiped his feet on the choice, on the predilections of sixty million men and women of the greatest country in the world! If you had any morals yourself, you would understand the immorality of that boy's stand today! It was not me he criticized - it was my readers!...Don't remove the gangplank, Sidney; you may wanna get back on board.This crab gumbo - terrific!The man in jail is always for freedom.Sure you're in jail, Sidney. You're a prisoner of your own fears, of your own greed and ambition; you're in jail.You, little boy, don't know who you are! Talking around corners with the big shots, ten dollar dinners - fourteen suits and cashmere coats - you tell yourself THAT'S who you are! Later you won't know who you are without a penthouse on upper Park! But underneath it all, ratting around from day to day, you DO know who you are! You're a fearful, ignorant nobody - a poor wop kid from the slums of Philly - hoping nobody else finds it out!I told you what I want you to do tonight!Sidney, I told you -And who do you think writes the column while Susie and I are away for three months?......The man in the moon?Thank you, Sidney.And, Sidney, I'll have that piece of paper back...Go to bed, Susie. It's late...What is he doing here?That subject it might be better not to start me on. He's made all the papers tonight.Is there something you wanted to say...? I've put up with a lot of your guff, Susie, because you were a child. But you're a woman now and I suspect, despite my best intentions, more than a bit of a slut...Whose arms will I have to pry you out of next? Not that I don't think you didn't invite it! I know that look of yours, that pose of being wronged - and how it arouses the crusading instinct in even a Sidney Falco -Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt! Let's call it quits, my dear. I'd like it fine if you found another home. That means the front door is open! Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT! And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage! You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!Another crisis past. She'll be fast asleep in five minutes, loaded with those headache pills...Now we'll get to you, Sidney. As far as the column is concerned - tonight you have forfeited every ethical consideration I ever felt for you...Let me finish what I started to say -What a cornball you are, Sidney...Susie, this is J.J.! Open up!Susan!...Talk to her, Sidney...Yuh...Yuh... Just a minute... Susie, it's Mr. D'Angelo - from the hospital...That means a lot to you?But I have to warn you, Susie - for your own sake - he'll still do time...He's a hop-head - that's a felony in New York. I can try, of course, to...GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE!You're incapable of the truth...Like most Italians, Sidney's got a big gift for dramatics. I, however, prefer the cool and stubborn facts. Sidney has not appeared in my column in weeks - check that fact with Mary. That leads right to another fact: Sidney had nothing to lose tonight! To the contrary, dear - ONLY HIS OBVIOUS GREED TO BEAT HIS WAY BACK INTO THE COLUMN EXPLAINS HIS ACCUSATIONS AGAINST ME! In brief, BLACKMAIL!Mind you, not that one true fact didn't come out of Sidney's mouth tonight: self-admittedly, he committed a vicious crime of jealousy against Steve Dallas! Now we have to clear Dallas, don't we?...But I'll have to sacrifice him... ...to do it. Am I doing right?Yes or no, Susie...?No, he's admitted that, Harry. My kid sister's a witness.No, he admits he planted the stuff on the Dallas boy...Yeah...jealousy....He's been trying to make my sister behind my back.That's a pretty coat.- but it's about time you had a new one.Don't kid a kidder. I'll see you for breakfast around eleven.Susie? Are you in bed...?I don't have to tell you, of course, that I cleared your boyfriend's name; I didn't let you down......I was saving this news for breakfast, but I think I'll jump the gun! I'M GONNA GIVE YOU AND DALLAS THE BIGGEST WEDDING THIS TOWN HAS EVER SEEN!Susie...?I'm getting the Mayor to perform the ceremony and - NO, I think I'll fly the Governor down from Albany... Do you hear...?Are you listening?...Susie!...You won't threaten me!...Nobody walks out on J.J. Hunsecker! CAMERA NOW MOVES CLOSER and closer to Hunsecker. The ANGLE is a weird one, tilting grotesquely upward.You need me - you all need me!...\"The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want\". That's bunk in a book! I'm the Shepherd of millions of little men and women!......I don't ask them to get on their knees, but they come to me for advice and guidance! Who are you to reject me!What makes YOU fit to sit in judgment on a man like me. Only a great person understands another great person, and that leaves you out!- That leaves you ALL out! You're pigmies! You're all sick, weak midgets! I'm proud to be alone!...", "clean_line": "come dead son buried ll check morning low thanks harvey wish dead wore hearing aid simple flick switch shut greedy murmur little men mac want man table
