{"Time-Machine-The": {"TIME TRAVELLER": {"raw_line": "I'm all right...just some food...a drink...Are you all right?Meat...I'm hungry for meat!No! I must tell it now... while I still remember.You're right, David. That's exactly what I have. - All the time in the world!... ever since we were all together five days ago, the last day of Eighteen Hundred Ninety Nine.I wanted to finish the job before the new century began. - I barely made it.Well, it has to do with time.When I speak of time, I'm referring to the fourth dimension.Now, as you know, the difficulty in explaining the fourth dimension is that it cannot be seen or felt - it must be thought of.On the contrary, Doctor! The fourth dimension is as true and as real a dimension as any of the other three. In fact, they couldn't exist without it.Well, take that box. It has the first three dimensions, as you said. But what if it didn't exist in Time? It wouldn't exist at all, would it?So - for an object to exist at all, it must exist in the fourth dimen- sion....and that fourth dimension is duration....Time!I'm coming to that. But first, consider! Why is it that we usually ignore the fourth dimension? Because we have no freedom to move in it. We can move in the other three -- up, down, forward, backward, sideways. But when it comes to Time, we are prisoners. Do you follow me, Anthony?Look! There are a lot of things in the world you don't understand, aren't there?But you don't refuse to believe in them because of that?Good! All I'm asking you to do now is to witness a demonstration of the possibility of movement in the fourth dimension. Philip, will you please hand me that box?I've told you. The larger model can carry a passenger on a journey through Time. - Not through Space, mind you, but through Time.That's the most important question to which I hope to find an answer. Can Man control his destiny? Can he change the shape of things to come?This experiment can be performed only once. If it succeeds, I lose my model forever. That is why I need witnesses.You're ready then?Doctor Hillyer, would you care to lend me your hand?Certainly.That's correct.Because we're in this room on December 31st, 1899, while the model you saw is perhaps a hundred years away. This room, or even this house, may no longer exist a hundred years from now. But the Time Machine is occupying the same space it did a moment before it went off on its journey.You must remember that the space you've just put your hand through is today's space. You can't put your hand into the space of tomorrow.No! Time changes space. This flat ground we're standing on now could have been at the bottom of the sea a million years ago. And a million years from now it could be the interior of a huge mountain.For my part, I intend to take a journey into the future. - Unless someone else prefers to volunteer.Of course, I am.Thanks for coming.I appreciate your gesture, David, but if you don't mind I'd rather you left me alone.I'm sorry.I'll try.You may have to. I don't.I prefer the future.You saw the experiment this afternoon, didn't you?Now you sound like Hillyer and Kemp.You must have plans for New Year's Eve. Don't let me keep you.I can't.I just want to see the old century out by myself.I promise you, I won't walk out of the door.David! Please don't think me un- friendly! - Come over to dinner - next Friday. Won't you?Fine...and will you bring the others with you?Goodnight.Oh, Mrs. Watchett! I've invited Mr. Filby and the others to dinner next Friday. Happy New Year, Mrs. Watchett.Filby! I expected more of an enthusiastic greeting from...Was?Yes...yes...I've been away.Why is that?Just a stranger who once knew your father.Front? What front?What war?No...no, thank you.Yes, I'm quite alright.Goodbye, Jaime.Good heavens, that's a dress?I can't understand you.Filby!You mean that horrible screeching?But I'm perfectly comfortable and I find your store magnificent. What splendid achievements, what gigantic strides mankind has taken, what...Indeed we have. Right here. Many years ago.It was two wars ago, I believe. Nineteen seventeen.I'm afraid it's going to take me a little time to explain... You see...Listen to me! It's important.All clear? I've got to talk to you.Well, and why not?Help her!...Are you all right?Why did I what?Must have been fifty of your friends watching you drown. Not one of them so much as lifted a finger. - A curious attitude - in a curious world. Aren't you the least bit interested in what I am...where I come from?Doesn't anyone age in this land of yours?What's your name?How do you spell that?Write! - Can't you write? Look!And what are your people called?In my time a berry this size would have made news in every civilized country.Sir, perhaps curiosity has died. Perhaps even courtesy has died, but I have come a long way and there are things I would like to know.Because I shall return to my time and they will ask questions such as what kind of government rules your world.Doesn't anyone work?But it must be planted, cultivated, nurtured...unless... Unless you have an economy so well organized that you can devote all your time to study and experimentation. Am I right?Books will tell me what I want to know. Books will tell me all about you.Yes...they do tell me all about you!What have you done? Thousands of years of building and rebuilding creating and re-creating so that you can let it crumble to dust.A million yesterdays of sensitive men dying for their dreams. For what? So you can swim and dance and play.I am returning to my time! Not to tell of the uselessness of the struggle - not to tell of the hopeless future - but only so that I can die among men!How do you open that panel?Morlocks? - Who are the Morlocks?Why are you afraid of the Morlocks?Tell me.Do the Morlocks live beneath the earth? Why must you obey their command?What happens to your people when they go below?Only children are frightened by the dark. - But then you are a child, aren't you? I'll build a fire.Get me a few more twigs.What was it?Do you know that the first thing which separated man from the rest of the mammals was his knowledge of fire? No, I suppose you don't. The next great stride came with the discovery of the wheel. Do you know what that is? I'm sorry I was angry with your people. I had no right to be. No more than if I had visited the Island of Bali in my own time. You were safe inside your great house, yet you came out into the night to warn me. The one characteristic which distinguished man from the animal kingdom was the spirit of self sacrifice. You have that quality, Girl. I'm sure all of your people have it. All it requires is someone to reawaken it. I shall try if you'll let me. Will you?That's a good start. - Now try to tell me...who or what are the Morlocks? Are they people or animals? What do you know about yourself? The past? Don't your people ever speak of the past?Don't you ever wonder about the future?Man's past is mainly a grim struggle for survival, but there have been moments when a few voices have spoken up. These rare moments have made the history of man a glorious thing. I refuse to believe it is dead and gone. We've had our dark ages before and this is only another of them. All you need is for someone to show you the way out. - I'm only a tinkering mechanic, but there must be this hidden spark in one of your people. If I can only kindle that spark, my coming here will have some meaning.Listen! Do you hear?Machines!You mean those animals run machines?I know, but have you seen the machines?Who told you?What sort of rings?Can you show me these rings?Are these the talking rings?They speak?Of what?How do you get it to talk?I'll be back.Weena! Where are you, Girl?What's happening? Tell me!Stop!What do you mean, all clear?But you didn't listen. You didn't learn anything. All that is left is fear...a blind animal fear. Ages ago men were taught to hide in the ground when the sirens blew... taught to run from a raining death... but those men are dead! And so are the men who slaughtered them. Don't you understand? You are slaves of a dead past... You don't even own your souls. You're led to slaughter like sheep!What about those who went below? How are they to come back?You can try. Won't any of you even try?Quick, something to burn! It's my last match!Weena! Weena, get the torch!Weena! Go on! Go on the steps!Sorry? - Sorry for what?Yes. - I am sorry because I could tell so much to the people of my own time... I could tell them about the happiness and sorrow the future has in store for them. They could learn from it...or would they?It isn't that, but I don't fit here anymore than you would in my time.No, Girl, you wouldn't be very happy there.No. No one like you. But there are friends who will miss me. - As a matter of fact, I'm probably late already.No, men. There is a woman too, of course! She looks after my house for me. She is sixty-two years old. - Much older than you are.Who?Up!Like this.Yes...you would be. More than pretty. I wish we could go back together, Weena, back to my own time...or to times before that when the world was young.
