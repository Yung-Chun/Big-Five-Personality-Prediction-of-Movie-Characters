{"White-Jazz": {"ME": {"raw_line": "I'm old. And all I have left is the will to remember......and the fear I'll forget...I killed innocent men. I betrayed sacred oaths. I reaped profit from horror. The names are dead or too guilty to tell. The events so brutal they beg to be re-told...Lieutenant Dave Klein, Vice Division. LAPD. That's what my face looked like before.Junior Stemmons. A partner I never asked for. The scowl meant to hide a shit-scared kid who'd been teaching evidence classes three months ago. His Old-Man was an LAPD lifer who never got past Sergeant.Mid-fight? Look at the crowd: you wanna be at the center of a riot?We let Sanderline finish this beating, we get his gratitude. *-relax Junior.Sanderline, I'm Lieutenant Klein of the LAPD and a real big fan-No you're not. Reuben is--for being a ranked fighter who still steals hubcaps. Shut up. If I was gonna arrest you, I wouldn't have let you finish: and that hook-uppercut combo you got is something special. Reuben's in custody. But you could be our Guest. Whaddya say?Welles Noonan, US Attorney. Ivy League Crimefighter. Launching a big boxing probe as a way to begin prying into everything else crooked and corrupt in LA.Unaware the LAPD was walking away with his two big witnesses.Then you can stop pointing at him.Hungry Sanderline?Shrimp cocktail. You want something Reuben?You're here because we want you to remember where you live.Excellent Sanderline.You live in LA, Asshole. You do not live in `Federal Government.'Stop laughing.What were you gonna tell Welles Noonan? He has a subpoena with your name on it, Sanderline. Why would someone like you need to talk to the U.S. Attorney?You're a legbreaker for the Mob. I know the Men that pay you for that will murder you if they hear you're about to talk to the U.S.-And they don't have to. Now tell me what you were gonna tell Noonan-Yeah.-who's `we?'G for `Giancana.' I owe him favors for the rest of my life.Tell Sam if I get minute-Sanderline, you gotta see this...DID THAT MUTT JUST JUMP?Remember where you live.LA's version of the Young Turks, only meaner.I was pissing. He was jumping.Noonan had Sanderline scared. After he sang to me he panicked & jumped.Take both men into custody before Noonan and the Feds could, and find * out what they were going to tell-Because I'm a Cop with a law degree, and you thought my legal-Bethune and Gallaudet don't think so.How do you know that?Johnson did that stint at the Nut House -- leak his file to your friends at the times-Alright. Where's this going? * Gun? Shield? What?So if the papers or Noonan come sniffing around-But you're not dismissing me.You want me to torpedo Diskant so your buddy Bethune can win a City * Council seat uncontested-Bradley's stooge now. A smart play suspending me: a built-in shield * for him if things go sideways.Black Buick...five Cars back...feels like a tail......or maybe I just need sleep.Press camped out post-Sanderline, looking for quotes to hang me with. *Retreat to Meg's. My kid sister and only living family. Mom and Pop died in `51 when their first plane ride became their last.How many times have I lied to you?You've always liked your Men mean.What would Mom and Dad say?Nothing. That's where I learned it.Yeah, pour me...a cup please. Black, no sugar.Pretty please.How's work? *How's Pete?Big Pete Bondurant. One-time LA Sheriff. Bounced when he beat-dead a Prisoner who spit at him. A duly impressed Howard Hughes hired him on as his full-time muscle. My Sister's new Hump. My oldest living Friend.Wanna do LAPD a favor tonight?Means $500 an hour.-you're the only Woman I know who calls Men-Morton Diskant, a man who preferred migrant workers to million dollar ballparks. Beating Bethune in their City Council Race despite getting outspent 10 to 1. If he wins, the Dodgers don't get a Stadium, Mexicans get to keep raising chickens two miles from City Hall and Bradley makes sure I * burn for Sanderline Johnson. *Junior brought along because he begged. Already hip to how many ways you can make money with a badge.What?Old. What are you writing? *-what `work'?-chapter 1: don't write shit down. Chapter 2: or other Cops might kill * you.I heard he was coming after both of us.Indictments. Prison time. Whole nine.I'm seriously thinking about turning Junior...testifying against you.Here we go.Seen Pete do this a dozen times and every time the same thought:God help me if he ever hits me like that.Junior picked up this Quiff jocking other Fags in a Men's Room. But Quiff was a Law Student who wanted his record kept clean.We're ruining his career, not his soul. Reload the camera.Drop out of the City Council race or I send these pictures to the papers.-and maybe salvage something that's a close cousin to `respect.' But what about your wife and kid getting hold of those pictures?Take the Quiff home.-of course it is.I need a nod from you Morton, let's me know you get it-Someone from the Times will call for a quote. Whatever your reason for dropping out make it real.-no thanks.I still got a day job, Pete-The Mutt jumped.Klein-...yeah...Narco's Snitch.So send Robbery.Why me?I thought that's what Morton Diskant was-Junior. Meet me at 1284 South * Tremaine. 20 minutes.Captain Dan Wilhite, Head of the LAPD Narcotics Division. A Michigan Catholic poisoned by 25 years in this desert. Recently divorced despite seven kids with his Ex.You smell like bourbon Wilhite--Junior's already here-Then get Bradley on the horn, so you can relay that order. I'm here on his word. Now, what happened?And presumed what?I'll bet. Who made the call?Where's the family?At 2 AM? *What about the Son? *Why's that? *Alright, you better cut out before * people start asking why the head of Narco is at a missing persons.What are you talking about Wilhite?The God-sized problems I triggered tossing Sanderline take shape: the LAPD's sanctioned dope-pusher vanishes -- that's a pretty juicy * spot to stick a new probe. *Officer.Besides bat-shit insanity, is there anything else about her that rings true?What's this `Peeper' riff she's on?See if any of the other Neighbors can verify this `Peeper' thing. *-Lieutenant Klein. I said `meet me' in twenty minutes' not `go in without me.'-is stepping on dicks. You don't know the history, the players or the play.The Department gave Magdalena a * monopoly on the LA dope trade decades ago-Us Pollyanna -- LAPD. We bullet- proofed him in exchange for 60% of his profit and a promise he only deal drugs in Darktown and East LA- *-give the man a prize. He'd also * rat his competition and kill the ones we couldn't convict. Now keep your mouth shut and stay on my hip.-are all the Magdalena vehicles accounted for?OFFICER.The old lady hear dogs barking? * Gunshots?She didn't hear barking...so they were either lousy guard dogs...or they knew the Killer. You can't hit something this clean unless you're point blank. He could've been petting them when he fired: look at the burn pattern- * Like when you shoot something with a silencer.I've shot things with silencers... And the old lady didn't hear any * gunshots.Maybe... *I want to talk to Bradley first. Where are the Mother and Daughter? *It's Klein.Hector's gone. Blood that may or may not be his leads out to the * garage. Two guard dogs shot dead but no other signs of a struggle. The house is intact.Wife and Daughter are here.Mother Madge aggrieved. * Daughter Lucille...indifferent. The * son is persona non grata and a strong early suspect.How's that?Yeah... *You want me to-I'm giving you on-scene command. * Bradley wants everyone removed from the premises and the entire house bagged for evidence and brought to Wilshire Station. Can you handle this?To find Tommy Magdalena.Another Black Buick. Call it a Fed * Tail. Noonan already up my ass. * Let's see if they got guts enough to keep following me South.Dispatch gave me Tommy's make and model: A `32 Ford Deuce with a bent eight. Hot-rodder Tommy liked to goose the cops into giving chase.Noonan tail confirmed: Fed faces * glow like Martians this far down Crenshaw.Get Lester and get me a scotch * straight. *Lester Lake. One-time velvet voiced crooner. But a dabble in the dope trade cost him a set of slashed vocal cords at the hands of none * other than Hector Magdalena. *What happened to your face?Where is he?Shit. He's wise.Just never got this...Hector Magdalena is missing, presumed dead. Tommy is our sole suspect.Heartbreaker, huh? You let him gig here last night?Tommy's playing days are over.What time did he show up?There's blood all over his house, seems to belong to him. There's just no body. Not yet.* How's that? How many times has he * been in here, busted you up?Tommy can't hold the throne? *Eyes and ears for me Lester. He turns up, you get in touch.Fritz Koenig. German born. Former * US Spymaster, current Head of the * LAPD's Intelligence Division. He * and Bradley in the middle of their own Cold War -- each fighting to be the second most important member of * the LAPD behind Chief Parker. *He jumped Fritz.Working his first big job.It does.Kid might have some climb in him. Reminds me of another pain in the ass.There's no body, and nothing was taken except Hector.Something like that. *My ass first Fritz, yours second.Tommy Magdalena has gone to ground and he's got a war chest to keep him there. The only way we take him quickly is to issue a citywide APB-Yeah. Hector's disappearance is definitely an inside job. That whole family feels hinky. The daughter was all bruises and no tears and Hector's hop-head wife * looks part punching bag.According to Wilhite, they were in Santa Barbara at the time.Vouching in evidence at Wilshire Station.What about Hector? Still missing.Wilhite. He was operating Hector-You got a light?It didn't look like you were all that upset with the attention.How's that?Thank you.You believe everything you read?Do you eat Dinner?Make a note: steal Bethune's guest- * list, then go door-to-door until * you find her again.This everything from the house?What did you tell the Watch Commander upstairs?-bag it until Bradley orders us otherwise.You don't. Our job is to find Tommy. And why is that out?-Don't write shit down. What do you * need Kid? A little bouncing ball, * bottom of the screen? * Magdalena is twenty years dirty with this Department...do you think * a word of that exists on paper?Shit.Howard Hughes. Billionaire germ freak. Boob man. Pete's prime benefactor. Nobody had seen him in years.Dave. Sorry I'm late. *Where's Mr. Hughes?-I'm not contagious...if that's what he's worried about.Yes you do. What's your pitch Mr. * Milteer?What makes you think I can do a better job than your people?-dubious honor if you knew the other people Pete knows. So you want to catch her in violation of her Service Contract? Something like that?I'm happy to help. But my price is $10,000. Not 5.For 10 give it any name you want. I'm a salaried employee of LAPD, * that means I'll have to find time off hours to do this.Thank you Peter.Sergeant, pass a message to Stemmons: I want him to meet me at the one-thousand block of South Tremaine tonight at 11 and at some point between now and then, I'll need him to do a preliminary work- up on a woman named Glenda Bledsoe. B-L-E-D-S-O-E. Thanks.Twice in a day doesn't happen. Not in a city like LA. Not like this. This is fate. This is Cupid firing his whole fucking quiver. Move. Make sure she's real.Mickey Cohen: one-time LA crime kingpin and West Coast Mob heavy who now trawls for loose change.Cecil B. Demoted.If this is `down' I never want to see `out.' How the mighty have fallen.What else are you hearing?Been a marked man for years Mick.No. But I am interested in your * leading lady. Bradley sent me. Saw * her at the Bethune-You want Chief Bradley angry?And now the only thing you're putting on sticks are corn dogs. What's her name, Mick?* Why was she there?What she drive?The real howler: fake kidnappings always bomb.Thinking I could tip Milteer off to the kidnap plot and pick up the other half of my payment... Thinking I should just give the first half back now...'cuz I know right now I'll never hurt her.No sense of time. Exhaustion steals it. A full hour earlier than I told * Junior to meet me. I need sleep. *STOP-ARE YOU BLIND-The only lead on Magdalena -- we're after the same guy you idiot!Assumed the Feds were smart. Assumed they were ready to stick a new probe into the LAPD's deal with Hector, like Bradley warned, like everyone feared. But they had no * clue and I just handed them the whole God damn thing. Like I said: I need sleep...First punch you ever thrown Noonan? Your Mom have to teach you how because Dad was the same no-chin, Connecticut Faggot you are?I think I hit the Noonan family dynamic, dead-on.Coffee?Who found me?He hit me with his car first.-confirmed Peeper.Noonan knocked me out.And he knows the Magdalena name and that I was chasing a suspect -- the * Peeper Lucille strips for. *And who he is. She has to. I want access to her juvie sheet or * whatever arrest records exist. * Rumor was Hector whored her out to * dealers he did business with. *No. Madge was a battered wife and * Lucille was a suborned whore. If * that's not motive, what is? You * want answers then we brace those * two hard.Noonan will figure out who and what Hector was sooner or later. *-until when?-this is bigger than a fucking ballpark! Hector Magdalena and Narco is the powder-keg, blows the * whole Department to hell. *-me. You want me to draw him off- *Bradley has a bigger angle and I'm getting close to it...I just haven't hit home. Yet. *Seltzer will take the blood out.When a Superior Officer tells you to leave the room, you leave the * fucking room. *Thanks. But forget it.Forget it. Burn it, s'not important now.I need an address on a guy named Ainge, George Ainge- *-after you get the Ainge address, * get back to the Magda-We're partners in name only. You want to stay in the room next time, Junior? Do something to impress me: like finding that address.Noonan replaced the Buick with a * Packard and a better Shadow-Man. * But I could still spot the tail. *This jet-engine urge to see her. Needing it like a junkie does. No logic. Just the push.Yeah. *In theory.Depends. Those Howard's?Except you.You just shop here now?Attack of the Atomic Vampires...Better than a billionaire does? Go make amends and finish out your service contract Ms. Bledsoe.Why?You're also better than a starring role in schlock horror flick that'll never see a screen, regardless if it's leading lady gets `kidnapped' or not. *Nor the second.-Dave. You're on Hughes' bad side Ms. Bledsoe. It's not a bright place to be. So please go-Klein. Go ahead... *Get me Lester. This is Lieutenant Klein, LAPD--this is LAPD-put Lester on the phone or I'll have your liquor license and after-hours permits yanked inside the hour...Got your message.I saw her singing the other night.Heroin? Tommy get her hooked?Where's this girl now? *She actually said `hiding out?' *Smart Tommy. Dodging Darktown altogether. Holed up in Hollywood. Hiding in plain sight.Stakeout work. Browse mugs. Match a face out front if I get lucky. Wait till Bido Lito's gets busy before I make my move.Shots fired, 1600 block of Ivar. * Suspect fleeing scene in red `32 * Ford Deuce travelling westbound on * Wilcox, vehicle impaired, intercept * at Hollywood Blvd--and I need an ambulance to respond to 1607 North Ivar, second floor, female negro, possible overdose.Where's Dan Wilhite?Or was it that Peeper across the * street that jacks off to your sad * little shows- *Am I? Where's Hector? You can't file murder charges without a corpse. Who knows this? Cops know this- You would know this.-he ever offer her to you? *I don't care where you get your * dick wet Wilhite. I care that * you're covering. Twenty years dirty * with this fucked-up family...your * secrets must stink like rot. *Yeah.You were born for the street Fritz. I never featured you for the suit and tie set.Where'd you get that haul?Sounds boring.Me too.Looking for leverage. Figure out Bradley's angle before I fry. Madge and Lucille in custody. No Hector and no Tommy equals No leads. Save one.Dan Wilhite. Dispatch shot me his temporary address. Some beach flop he fled to after his wife put him out.My first thought, pure panic: Noonan figured the Narco-Magalena connection.But it wasn't a Federal Subpoena. Wilhite was being called to testify by Bob Gallaudet, a man who doesn't piss without Bradley's say-so. Bradley trying to beat Noonan to the punch and burn the LAPD himself...why?Swap my car for Wilhite's. The former head of the LAPD's Narcotics division dead in the trunk. Call it the leverage I was looking for -- his body can buy me out of bad spot-Bradley trying to bury me too. That subpoena means my fifteen year career with the LAPD just went up in smoke.Hey-You find him?That knife is in there-Meet me down the street from his place. You got bolt cutters?Thirty minutes.Long story.Yeah?Two honks if he shows. Then meet me in the alley, back of his place.One thing at a time pal.Junior the Insane: You couldn't hide what he was hiding in 1958 LA, and not have it rot your mind.Junior stealing evidence from the Magdalena crime scene.Junior the Climber, trading me up to Noonan. Thinks bootlicking will buy him a Bureau gig.Get it open if you can and meet me back at Meg's!Call it. Keep going and give up Wilhite's car and the corpse inside, or lay back and deal with Noonan's Buzzcuts.Civil servants can't afford manicures?Proof. If you had it, you wouldn't be fucking around with shitty shakedown routine -- you'd file. Coercion equals confession. So let's see you pound it out of me.Junior. Your secret weapon right? I mean, I know J. Edgar is a slanted fuck, but traditionally `vicious fags' don't make the best major case witnesses. I'm worried those burning dildos may have damaged his credibility.Not if you had the next hundred years.-everyone knows I'm a piece-a-shit. What are you proving? Bradley's the guy flanking you right now. The guy who's vulnerable right now.-you done anything with the Magdalena case?-Dealing drugs for 20 years! Arrested once. Hall a' fame career! You photographed the head of Narco in-front of his house...Jesus Christ, you need cue cards? Come after me: you get me. Go after what I can give you and you get the LAPD's power-set on a slab.I'll bring them to you.Then like I said: you only get me.I give you the body of Dan Wilhite, head of LAPD's Narcotics Division. Proof of a 20-year criminal collusion between his department and Hector Magdalena and my testimony to link the dots. Then I leave LA for good.Suicide.No more tails. I don't want anyone else incriminated.I get a copy of that?Running out of room, time, both. Trapped between Bradley and Noonan.Yeah and they made me leaving the scene. Had to barter out.My Testimony. I signed a Federal Witness Agreement.It's bullshit. Noonan's got no intention of honoring it. They want Stemmons files though. I think Junior's been working angles for awhile, doing his own investigations.He had a hand grenade tied to that. How much longer do you need?You read my mind....tell me if I'm being too rough.Tell me anything. Tell me everything.Why here?You?-your ticket to immortality?And you still want it-Surrounded by winos in werewolf suits. That's...dedication.Dwight Gillette.I've killed 44 men.33 for War. 2 for principle. 9 for profit -- mostly. Why did you sign with Hughes, knowing what he was?I'm not much good.You been up all night?There's nothing to tell.I don't want it anymore.Junior stole it.Yeah.That's why I needed his address. I was trying to help him before something like this happened. The kid snapped-in-half Fritz. He's literally lost it. He say anything else to you?Like I said Fritz, he's flipped his lid. I don't want to go to Internal Affairs but I'm afraid Junior might've forced just that.Be careful Fritz. He's dangerous.Fritz Koenig, the best inspector in the LAPD, digging. He'll find Junior and when he does he'll find Ainge...then Glenda...Where is he?Noonan's deadline lapsed ten minutes ago. An official fugitive from justice now.Bradley doing damage control, the forced relocation of the Ravine's immigrants has the press in a feeding frenzy. Reuben Ruiz forced along as the token Mexican mouthpiece.Your subpoena hasn't caught up to me yet, Chief...Hurwitz Holdings.You, Bethune, and Gallaudet bought big chunks of Chavez Ravine over the past two years through a shell company called Hurwitz Holdings. If the Dodgers move here the value of the land booms...you could sell it off for a fortune -- or hang onto it and make even more. The parking lots alone would make you all multi-millionaires.Word gets out that the three City Officials who were pushing hardest for a Stadium also stood to gain a mint -- might color public opinion. Might color it even more to know that the LAPD's Chief of Detectives was trying to purchase a huge tract of that land from the biggest dope dealer in town.Hector Magdalena owned ten and half acres of this land. You didn't give a shit about solving his disappearance. You were worried that your real estate deal was going south.Junior Stemmons. The ex-evidence teacher. His `excellent ratings' didn't stop him from stealing the Magdalena seizure and doing his own investigation.That was stapled to the cover. Why would Noonan worry about a Turd like me now...when a high profile target like you can be taken down.No idea. If you haven't spoken to Internal Affairs today, I'm sure they've called. Junior's apartment caught fire. Deeply deviant material inside. Round him up- -and anyone he's got with him.Now, quid pro quo...you subpoenaed Wilhite too.-don't worry `how.' Why?You're going after Narco yourself.-so you show-up Noonan...co-opt his crusade and condemn your own before he can...Jesus Christ can you turn lemons to lemonade.And how. So where do we go now Chief?-that report is only useful to Noonan now.A mistake to underestimate me now Chief. The price to keep your secrets is steep...and you're going to pay up. Soon.Dead body.Borrowed time burning fast. My days are done. Only hours remain. Whatever moves I have left...make them now.Take a couple bottles of bleach, pour it over the trunk.My foreseeable future.You taking her?What?This is almost over Pete -- I'll give Milteer the five-grand back.I'll square it. It's my thing.I'm sorry.Things are as bad as they've ever been...Bradley's Third Party Theory. Everything linked: Wilhite, Magdalena, the Ravine...I've got my own theories...and the one that sticks is the one I pray I'm wrong about.Klein.How'd you get this number Junior?-you're a broom-closet Queer. Your career is over.You snitch to Noonan, then what?Who? The Soviets?-Where you used to snag fruits for Vice? A volunteer gig I'm guessing.Hey, did the Feds dig your pad?-I see anybody near there Junior, the deals off and I gift that file to Bradley to fuck you with-Glenda?Jesus...hey...-no, no. It's nothing. I had a phone call, just before yours.I don't want you to worry. I'm handling it. But I might send my friend Pete out there.I'd just rather have someone there with you.I'm better-looking in low light, I didn't want to blow it for myself.Stay by the phone.Where's the knife.Turn your lights off...and just come out and talk to me...Fritz.Third Party Confirmed...I fucking knew it.I thought it was Noonan tailing me.Wilhite ran Magdalena for you, not Narco.I didn't. I had a feeling. I smelled cover-up all over Hector's disappearance and Wilhite wouldn't have the muscle or the mind-set to kingpin something that big by himself...you knew about Bradley trying to buy him out?Bradley...you two got greed in common.You knew about Wilhite and Lucille. That's how you were operating him....and someone else's...And now you're his only ally. This sad queer who fell out with cops and flunked out with the Feds. So you get this file to battle Bradley with. What's Junior get in return?Whatever moves I had left...I just made.Won't work for me Fritz.Fritz Koenig.Dead. Along with Wilhite, Junior...and Hector Magdalena.To collect. I have the things you need to destroy Noonan's play. These same things can be used to destroy you.Stemmons files...and Wilhite's body. He committed suicide after you subpoenaed him.And it's what you need to burn Narco to the ground...but if those files and his body were to be given to Noonan and the Feds, with me providing the cherry-on-top testimony of a rogue cop. Well. The word `Cataclysmic' comes to mind.A percentage of your Dodger Stadium stake in perpetuity. You buy my silence for a fourth of Hurwitz Holdings.What'd you expect? A stick-up? Empty your safe? I'm about to disappear for good, and you're gonna fund my new life. You can't counter-punch out of this. Arrest me and I snitch the world. I'll hold that over your head for the rest of your life. Renege on our deal and it won't matter if it's tomorrow or ten years from now...I'll fry you with that file. I'm officially outta time now Chief. Call it.Shaking to see her, touch her...You go to bed drunk, or just been up all night.Seen Pete do this a dozen times and every time the same thought: God help me if he ever hits me like that...Don't kill me.I put you here...that Powerhawk--burn it.We'd never make it inside.I'm through the worst of it.Whatever the cost.Just like that.My deadline with Noonan: two days old. He and Bradley playing chess by press release.Cop-killings clear the way for Bradley's \"Redeem The Ravine' mandate. Dodger Stadium construction moves forward. Captain Dan Wilhite and Hector Magdalena. Missing. APB's issued. Bradley's press fodder cast them as `outlaw cop and drug dealer' who most likely fled to Mexico. Narco under a full-blown, Bradley-led investigation.I haven't loved you long enough to leave it all behind...Too many enemies. Too many ways for you to get hurt. Too close to me...a decision that will haunt me the rest of my days...\"My Heaven: the hours I had with you. My Hell: the years ahead, without. Someday I'll see you before you even know I'm looking.\"Pete's penance beating built me a brand new face...nobody gives me a second glance...not even the cops I recognize.My will to remember. My confession complete. Still not enough. Post-scripts.Glenda: twenty-five years avoiding her name. Only a photograph, yellowed with years-passed, reminding me of everything I never was. Then a week-old Times at the place I buy coffee. Her picture sees me before I realize she's looking.

Angeles Police Department in general, and Lt. David Klein in particular, of murder at worst, gross incompetence at best...'-but time, a mandate and new targets...I need to speak to the Lieutenant alone.Describe to me your duty, as you understood it, regarding Sanderline Johnson and Reuben Ruiz.-and why did I choose you for this?-because your a thug with a law degree. Because I thought by now you'd be so indebted to this Department for not indicting and/or * imprisoning you, that diligent, honest discharge of duty would be assured. And I made a horrible misjudgment. *Bob's happy because he wants to be State Attorney General and his most likely opponent will be Welles Noonan. Tom's happy because Morton Diskant, who's leading their City Council race, is endorsed by Noonan. Thus, they're not seeing the larger play. Noonan's new target will likely be the LAPD itself.Because that's where I would aim: a subpoenaed Federal witness plummets to his death in the company of two LAPD detectives? This screams Police Corruption. * This offers Noonan the possibility of payback in the form of national headlines.My friends would be more interested in this. Coroner's preliminary: white paint chips found embedded in Sanderline Johnson's scalp. A matching dent on the white window sill. I checked with the hotel switchboard and found a call was patched to your room at about the same time Johnson flew out of it. It shocks and sickens me that your allegiance to the Chicago mob would take precedence over the LAPD.The appearance of disciplinary measures taken against you are mandated post-Sanderline Johnson, * so your suspension will be recorded but sealed...and kept quiet for now- *-we can provide adequate proof of your dismissal.Just on paper. Since I misjudged the Cop I thought you were, I'm going to leverage the Cop that you are.Morton Diskant is to be removed from the City Council race. The means and methods implemented to that end I will entrust to you.-or spend the next month in lock-up * before being arraigned on charges * of gross misconduct and dereliction * of duty. The preamble before you * face life in prison for murder. *Diskant works Saturdays. Late.-you know who Hector Magdalena is?He's missing. His home was broken into at some point within the last hour.The only thing taken was him. Wilshire Station is on-scene. Get over there right now.Call it penance.-that makes one of us. 1284 South * Tremaine.Update.Family?Describe their state.Alright, kick everyone out. Including all police personnel.Don't question me. Is your partner on hand?Have him bag and seal everything and bring it to Wilshire Station. Find Tommy Magdalena post-haste and take him into custody. No APB's, nothing to alert Noonan and the FBI to this situation.-no more information over an open * line. I'll be at the Bethune event later on today. Find me there.-no. We can't risk that. Do you * make him for the murderer?Do you suspect either of the women? *Verify that. Where is your partner?Keep him on that. He had excellent ratings as an evidence teacher and * I trust him more than you. Find Tommy Magdalena. Focus everything on that effort & I want him apprehended Klein, not killed.And most likely dead. Find the Son. * Stakeout the residence. Put tails on both the mother and daughter -- I want this investigation working quietly, and around the clock.-don't worry about Dan Wilhite. You deal directly with me. Now go out the back. I don't want the press recognizing you.What are you doing here?Progress on Magdalena.Is that who knocked you out?He's having you tailed then...That's immaterial. *Until Tom Bethune votes on the floor of the city council in two days, ratifying the official start of construction on Dodger stadium-Don't be dramatic, it looks weak. Right now, Noonan needs a pursuit, so I supply him with one- *-you've been drawing him off. And the more he sees you the less he'll think of anything other than getting you. Now find Tommy and * take him alive. Do not let Noonan * get to him. As a potential major * case witness against the LAPD, * Tommy Magdalena isn't just a powder- * keg, he's an atom bomb. *-this area has long been rife with crime and venality, but with a brand new Stadium, we can make this horrible blight a bright spot and give our Los Angeles Dodgers the home they deserve. Reuben Ruiz can tell you of his travails growing up in this horrible slum and why now is the time to `Redeem The Ravine.'-Welles Noonan is an unscrupulous hack politician whose smear campaign against us will fail, for he has grievously underestimated the moral rectitude of the Los Angeles Police Department.Now if you'll excuse me, I'll leave you with Reuben Ruiz.How?Why would he investigate me?Where is Stemmons?I'll issue an A.P.B. saying Stemmons is a known deviant targeting kindergarten children.How do y-Exposing the corrupt parts of the LAPD will redeem the whole. I'll prove that Police can police themselves-No Cop will testify against other Cops. This is why Wilhite has suddenly disappeared.There are other forces at work here...faces we need to identify. Names we need to know. A third party.No. It ensures our mutual destruction should you choose to share the contents of that Stemmons file. Which I know you won't do until you figure out how it will best benefit you.Who?Where?Why are you here?Things like?This body is in your possession?What will this cost?Doubtful.Wilhite's body...Bury it....police unit run amok, who's long tradition of graft, does not extend to other divisions of the LAPD...", "clean_line": "turn attorney noonan accusing los angeles police department general lt david klein particular murder worst gross incompetence best time mandate new targets need speak lieutenant duty understood sanderline johnson reuben ruiz choose thug law degree thought indebted department indicting imprisoning diligent honest discharge duty assured horrible misjudgment bob happy wants state attorney general likely opponent welles noonan tom happy morton diskant leading city council race endorsed noonan seeing larger play noonan new target likely lapd aim subpoenaed federal witness plummets death company lapd detectives screams police corruption offers noonan possibility payback form national headlines friends interested coroner preliminary white paint chips embedded sanderline johnson scalp matching dent white window sill checked hotel switchboard patched room time johnson flew shocks sickens allegiance chicago mob precedence lapd appearance disciplinary measures taken mandated post sanderline johnson suspension recorded sealed kept quiet provide adequate proof dismissal paper misjudged cop thought going leverage cop morton diskant removed city council race means methods implemented end entrust spend month lock arraigned charges gross misconduct dereliction duty preamble face life prison murder diskant works saturdays late know hector magdalena missing home broken point hour thing taken wilshire station scene right penance makes south tremaine update family state alright kick including police personnel question partner hand bag seal bring wilshire station tommy magdalena post haste custody apb alert noonan fbi situation information open line ll bethune event later today risk murderer suspect women verify partner excellent ratings evidence teacher trust tommy magdalena focus effort want apprehended klein killed likely dead son stakeout residence tails mother daughter want investigation working quietly clock worry dan wilhite deal directly want press recognizing progress magdalena knocked having tailed immaterial tom bethune votes floor city council days ratifying official start construction dodger stadium dramatic looks weak right noonan needs pursuit supply ve drawing sees ll think getting tommy alive let noonan potential major case witness lapd tommy magdalena isn powder keg atom bomb area long rife crime venality brand new stadium horrible blight bright spot los angeles dodgers home deserve reuben ruiz tell travails growing horrible slum time redeem ravine welles noonan unscrupulous hack politician smear campaign fail grievously underestimated moral rectitude los angeles police department ll excuse ll leave reuben ruiz investigate stemmons ll issue saying stemmons known deviant targeting kindergarten children exposing corrupt parts lapd redeem ll prove police police cop testify cops wilhite suddenly disappeared forces work faces need identify names need know party ensures mutual destruction choose share contents stemmons file know won figure best benefit things like body possession cost doubtful wilhite body bury police unit run amok long tradition graft extend divisions lapd"}}}
