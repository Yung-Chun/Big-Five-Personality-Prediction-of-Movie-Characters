{"Body-Heat": {"RACINE": {"raw_line": "The Seawater Inn. My family used to eat dinner there twenty-five years ago. Now somebody's torched it to clear the lot.Probably one of my clients.It's four a.m.My history's burning up out here.Where's your hat?'You're spent.' Where'd you hear that?Judge Costanza, perhaps when I've presented all --You would look favorably on that?I'll talk to him.Thank you, Your Honor.My defense was evolving. You guys got scared. Costanza doesn't like me. What'd I do to him?Maybe Costanza was in on it. That's why he was mad.He's pretty good, that's the weird part.No. Do I want to?That must have been Mrs. Block's idea, some kind of punishment.Stella, this is beneath even you. Things must be slow.Mrs. Singer, I would have gladly come to the house.Don't worry about it. I'll find you a doctor who's more understanding. Is it bad today?How well I know. We'll sue those reckless bastards dry. Excuse my language.You can stand here with me if you want, but you'll have to agree not to talk about the heat.Meaning what?Then you should have said -- 'I'm a happily married woman.'What?And how, happy is that?What else you like -- Ugly? Lazy? Horny? I got 'em all.Some. If they haven't been around much.How 'bout I buy you a drink?I'll buy him one too.My favorite kind. We'll drink to him.I'm liking him better all the time. You better take me up on this quick. In another forty-five minutes I'm going to give up and walk away.What kind?Make it two.You're not staying in Miranda Beach. I would have noticed you.Pinehaven. You're staying up in Pinehaven, on the waterway. You have a house.You look like Pinehaven.Well tended.Me? I need tending. I need someone to take care of me. Rub my tired muscles. Smooth out my sheets.I just need it for tonight.Matty. I like it. Right over your heart.I asked you not to talk about the heat.Right away. I'll even wipe it off for you.I know you.What about them?Do I remind you of hot air?Bourbon, any kind, on the rocks. Another?I'm no yokel. Why, I was all the way to Miami once.I'm not that eager.Ned Racine.Are you all right?Maybe you need a tune-up.I don't talk that way.This is the only joint in Pinehaven.You seemed like a woman with all the vices.What'd I do?You must come here a lot.Maybe you should drink at home.Maybe you shouldn't dress like that.You shouldn't wear that body.I know that sometimes the shit comes down SO heavy I feel like I should wear a hat.I'll take you.I'll follow you. I want to see the chimes.I want to hear them.I'm not looking for trouble.I don't know who we're going to fool. You've been pretty friendly.Lady, you must be some kind of crazy!Jesus.Just like my place.No help?You're not nervous alone?You do have chimes.What's that?No, out there.What is in there?I just got here.You didn't bring me here to see your wind chimes.No. not very often.I don't think you want me to go.There's nothing to be afraid of.You're not so tough after all, are you?That's right... that's right.I like this place. It's got a nice feel.So it could use a better mattress. See to it, will you?Hey, gimme a break here. It takes a little while.It takes me a good thirty seconds.Jesus, I think you're right -- -- you better be on the bottom.Wow! No, I must object --Enough.What are you doing?You're afraid of your maid?This is an interesting interpretation. Is that why you've started smoking my brand?Hey, lady, wanna make love?I'm sorry.I feel like a jerk.I'm an idiot. Nice to meet you. Are you staying in town?It's unusual. We're famous for our cool breezes.I didn't see her car. I'm sorry. I got to be more careful.You know, this has never been one of my pleasures. Car. I considered the time I spent making it -- -- like this ... penance for some sin.I never knew. Maybe worshipping women instead of God. But it never did anything for me.No.You're killing me.Come on! It's been three days. I want to see you --I'm going. I'm going.I'm here.What do you take me for?You think I'm a kid?Listen! I love that sound.Is that all you ever think about?Hey! I'm kidding.You look terrible. Don't you sleep?What do you mean, I been around.Oscar.There's nothing to tell. I lead a lonely life.There you are.How's the cop business, Oscar?Hell, no. Someday -- Deputy County Prosecutor.Hi, Glenda.I do. I want you with me.It is conceivable I'll make a buck someday.Anyway, you'll come out all right.Yeah. He's ripe.What?How is it?The truth? I wish you were going to be loaded. Does it matter? No. No.I want to see.Nope, Small weekend. Tiny little weekend.Beverly, do yourself a big favor and forget it.Whatever you're thinking.Yeah.Did you tell him?Okay, I'm coming.How do you know?How'd he get so fat?Who's \"they\"'I wonder what they call themselves. Maybe I've heard of them.The Breakers? I thought Hermie Fisher owned that land.Why?No. I don't.What is it, Matty? Tell me exactly what frightens you.That's where we're at, isn't it, Matty?That's what we're both thinking -- how good it'd be for us if he were gone. It'd be real sweet for us.Don't let it scare you. Because he's not gonna die. There's nothing wrong with him, is there? There's no reason to think he's gonna die, is there?That's right. So we might as well forget about it, It's not gonna just happen to make things nice for us... It won't just happen.Maybe that's a smart way to be now, Matty. Maybe we both should be.The only thing wrong with your husband right now... is us.Well, well. Hello to you --Ned.That hasn't changed, has it?I can understand that. It's a terrific place.I was just going to grab a bite.No. Thanks very much, but I don't want to interfere with --Is that right?F. S. U.I can afford to send my shirts out. And eat here once a month, if I don't order an appetizer.That's all right. I don't like it much.Do you?What is it, exactly?You don't have to be specific.Yeah? Around here?Is that right?A lovely lady.That's understanding.I'm not sure. You mean, lay the groundwork? Earn it?Yeah. I know that kind of guy. I can't stand that. It makes me sick.I'm not like that.Jesus! Did Beverly see you?Angry? I'm not angry -- How'd you get in?I know.Yes, that's right. You can't call. Never call. We have to be very careful now about the phone. The phone company keeps records.You did good. You've called my apartment from the house.No? Those two times --That's good. We have to be careful about the phones now.We could account for a couple calls. We've had some contact. That would make sense.Because we're going to kill him. We both know that.That's what you want, isn't it? We knew it was coming. It's the only way we can get everything we want, isn't it?The man's gonna die for no reason but we want him dead.He doesn't deserve it. Let's not ever say that. We're doing it for us. And you're going to inherit half of everything he owns. That's what the will says, right?That's it then. We're gonna kill him. And I think I know how.Yeah, it's real all right, and if we're not careful, it's gonna be the last real thing we do.I know where he is. It's not far from here. I don't want you with me.That's it?Just regular gasoline?What?I don't care about that. That's all there is to it?Sorry.Thanks.That's the way it is. There's nothing we can do about it.No. Forget it.Listen to me, Matty. Nothing strange can happen in his life right now, not one thing out of the ordinary. That's vital, that's the main thing. If anything does, the chances double that we get caught. You and I are walking out there on the edge every second now. One false move and we're gonna fall off. It'll be all over. You've got to remember that all the time. You'll get half of everything and it'll be plenty. No matter what it is, we're gonna be satisfied. We're not gonna get greedy. If we do, we'll get burned. You gotta believe me, baby, the odds that we'll get burned are good enough without looking for trouble.Okay. Gotta go.I'm just going for a ride. I wish it was all this dangerous.And?And?We won't talk again after I leave here tonight. I'll be in Miami by noon Friday. You won't be able to reach me. When I see you again, he'll be dead.-- Asleep.She won't wake up now.I've been out there waiting for two hours.Yeah?It's open.You took a chance coming here. Where's Edmund?I didn't want to talk. I just wanted to think.Maybe we all did.And what have you got?It's not too late to back out.What do you mean?You don't think I can pull it off.That's not what you really mean, is it, Matty?No, it isn't. You think he's too much for me. You think I'll fuck it up, get us caught.No? Well that's what I've been thinking.It does in this world, the one we're living in.When's he coming back?That'll be it, then. Nothing will stop us.Yeah. I wasn't before, but I am now.This time you're going to know how to reach me. I don't want any more surprises.The cars at the end of the drive. Spend the fifteen minutes cleaning up inside, then come. You're gonna have to be careful in this fog. Are you all right?Fifteen minutes.Uh -- no. I don't think so.I don't have them. I told you.Get the hell out of here and don't come back.Shh!They're right on time and I'm running late.We won't talk for a long time.Who is he?Hello.Yes.Yes.Yes.Yes.Yes... I see.Uh-huh. What problem is that?No no, that would be all right.I know of them.Yes, I think so.Right.Will you get me Mrs. Edmund Walker, please.I thought the temporary put her in. She came in while you were on vacation. Look it up. They were in Pinehaven, I think.Okay. Try again later.How are you?No. I don't. My condolences.Mrs. Walker, I'm very sorry about your husband.Hello, Peter.Although it's certainly not required. The witnesses to the signing of a will are not commonly available when the will is entered into probate. It's not standard by any means.I'm confused, too. Do you have a problem with the witnessing or the signatures? What is it you're getting at?In the state of Florida, when a person dies without a will, and there are no children and no surviving parents, then the spouse inherits everything.You look good in black.At first I couldn't figure out when you got ahold of my stationery and stuff. It finally came to me... Edmund's signature must have been a snap. And you knew I wasn't gonna challenge mine --You've really done it, Matty. You really have.I hope you haven't done us in.Hi, guys. Just come on in, make yourself at home.Sorry, Oscar. Would you guys a beer?It ain't great this time of day.What do you mean?What read in the paper. He died in the fire. Looks like arson--Okay, was arson. You don't know if he was setting it and messed up... or if that's just what someone wanted it to look like.His people owned the place or something?They asked me to re-do the will. I met with her and Edmund. It was pretty simple. This Mary Ann Simpson witnessed it with me. Walker didn't seem to think it was any big deal.That's it.I don't know... old friend of theirs, good-looking broad. She was just passing through.I suppose it's possible. I don't know much about her, except -- -- what I've seen. Wouldn't shock me, either way.Well, I'm sorry, guys. I'm afraid I can't do that.First of all, did you get a look at her?That wouldn't be quite so meaningful, except that today she started coming on to me. And maybe you haven't heard but the lady is about to come into a great deal of money.The fact is, she's invited me out to her place tonight. And I'm going. And I'll keep on going as many nights, or days, or weekends, as she'll have me.Peter, she's not gonna inherit anything by killing me.They already think you're involved.Great.That's right.I've been down there a lot lately. Isn't that amazing? Miami. Jesus. I'm handling the purchase of some property down there. I'll be going back in the future... if that's all right, if it's still legal to go to Miami.Nooo. No, I'm not mad. Why should I be mad just because my friend here, who I've know for years, wants to know of my whereabouts on the night of our recent local murder?That's my business!So what?Look, what is this? What do you want? Am I supposed to be an undercover agent for you guys, or something?How 'bout tonight I ask her? 'Say, did you kill your husband? My friends were just wondering...'Are we done here?I'll go out this way. I've had a lot of experience with disgruntled people. I'll be over to Stella's, if you want to have some lunch.Hello, Mrs. Kraft.How are you making out?You must be Heather.I'm Ned Racine, Heather. I've heard a lot about you. It's nice to meet you.I'm sorry our town is so hot for your visit.Goodbye.I'm fine, Stella. I'm fine. What's the latest? Any hot news?What's the special?What day'd you cook 'em?I don't know. I may have had my share for the day.That's it?Don't say that. Don't say you don't have them.They had to be here when you cleaned up that night. Think about it, think hard. They've probably got my prints on them.So where could they have gone?The housekeeper? Where would she have put them? You've been through his things.That's crazy. You imagined it. I know, I've been imagining things, too. Plenty.Don't you think we would have heard from her by now?I'm sorry.They've been stalling. They're draggin it out, hoping they'd come up with some way to implicate you.Peter?What are you doing here?Yeah?Nah. I'm going to Miami tomorrow. I'm not gonna have time.I'm closing this real estate deal I've been working on.Is this gonna be one of those conversations? Maybe I should have my lawyer present.You're not known for being a hardliner.Why is that?Ned Racine.Forget it.Matty Walker?When was this?Did you tell her about the Gourson case?Did you tell her about Gourson?Just off the hook. What?I'll find out.He's good.Thanks, Teddy.Yeah. Hello.Okay. Where are you?Tell me.What's the best part?Do you have them?Yes.In the boathouse.Yes.Hello, Matty.In the back. With yours.I could see.Yes, it is.It's Edmund's gun. You remember it, don't you?I think you know.It's the glasses, Matty.I didn't see them.Maybe I missed them. The way you missed them that night.Keep talking, Matty. Experience shows I can be convinced of anything.You never quit, do you? You just keep on coming.The glasses, Matty. Why don't you go down there and get them?I said I didn't see them.No, Matty! Stop! Don't go in! Matty.She's alive.But what if that was someone else's body in there? What if it was already there when I got there -- dead and waiting for me. Maybe her friend... Mary Ann.You're not listening to me. What if she's been using this other girl's name? Since she met Walker three years ago, since she first spotted him and decided to take him... one way or another. Maybe Walker -- or any of us -- never knew her real name.I don't know. Maybe there was something in her past, something so bad she was afraid it would queer it with Walker if he found out -- that he'd never marry her.Let's say she's living as the other girl, this girl from her past. Someone whose history she knew and could use any way she wanted. And there's only one person in the world who knows the truth.And then just when Matty's got me on the line, when she's finally going to collect, that one person shows up. That girl. Finds her. And threatens to expose her. So Matty starts paying her off. Maybe she even promises to cut her in on Edmunds' money. Now she's got to share it with two people.But when Matty sees a way to get rid of both of them at once. A way to solve all her problems and get clear, with no one looking for her. At the boathouse. You find two bodies, me and this girl. Two killers dead. Case closed.You can't find the money, can you, Oscar? Doesn't that tell you something?Oscar, don't you understand? That was her special gift she was relentless. Matty was the kind of person who could do what was necessary. Whatever was necessary.", "clean_line": "seawater inn family eat dinner years ago somebody torched clear lot probably clients history burning hat spent hear judge costanza ve presented look favorably

too smart, are you?I like that in a man.You don't look lazy.Tell me, does chat like that work with most women?I wondered. Thought maybe I was out of touch.I told you. I've got a husband.He's out of town.He only comes up on the weekends.You want to buy me something? I'll take one of these.Cherry.Is this town that small?How'd you know?How does Pinehaven look?Yes, I'm well tended, all right. Well tended. What about you?Get married.Good. Nice move, Matty.At least it's cool. I'm burning up.Would you get me a paper towel or something? Dip it in some cold water.You don't want to lick it?Look who's here. Isn't this a coincidence?You're the one that doesn't want to talk about the heat. Too bad. I'd tell you about my chimes.The wind chimes on my porch. They keep ringing and I go out there expecting a cool breeze. That's what they've always meant. But not this summer, This summer it's just hot air.What are you doing in Pinehaven?There are some men, once they get a whiff of it, they'll trail you like a hound.What is your name, anyway?Matty Walker.Yes. My temperature runs a couple degrees high. Around 100 all the time I don't mind it. It's the engine or something.Don't tell me -- you have just the right tool.How'd you find me, Ned?How'd you know I drink?You shouldn't have come. You're going to be disappointed.A lot of them have tried that seat. You're the first one I've let stay.Most men are little boys.Too quiet.This is a blouse and a skirt. I don't know what you're talking about.I don't like my body much. It's never been right.Sometimes, I don't know. I get so sick of everything, I'm not sure I care anymore. Do you know what I mean, Ned?Yeah, that's what I mean.I think I'll get out of here now. I'm going home.I have a car.You want to see the chimes.That's all. If I let you, that's all.I mean it. I like you. But my life is complicated enough.This is my community bar. I might have to come here with my husband some time. Would you leave before me? Wait in your car? I know it seems silly...Now leave me alone.Remember your promise.She goes home nights.No.A gazeboBoat house.Boat.It's a mess. There's a row boat, a lot of lounge chairs... things like that.I think you should go now.You've seen them. Please go.Yes, I did. I said what I meant. Do you ever do that?Yes... Please.There is for me.Thank you. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lot you come.No... I'm weak.Yes, yes...Please, please ...I didn't want this to happen. But I didn't try hard enough to stop it... Because I wanted you. I wanted you here, like this ... This is bad for me. I know it. Now nothing's going to be the same anymore.You were on top.Yes sir.It's your fault.Are you sure? I just want to make sure here.No, you misunderstood -- -- this is my new saddle, and I just want to --I've got to wash these.That's right. My mother told me \"knowledge is power.\"No one must know. Promise me, Ned. No one.Ned, this is Mary Ann.Do you want to stay for dinner?Mary Ann's an old friend. She's like a sister to me. She wants me to be happy.What sin?Not even a Mercedes? With genuine calf skin upholstery?Not this?Is there any more ice? I'm burning up.He's coming up tomorrow.I can't stand the thought of him... He's small and mean... and weak.Just do what I say! Go into the living room.I'm going to make it up to you tonight. But you must behave. Now go!Good.Good evening, sir... welcome to... to Flight 413 ... nonstop to ...Don't you like it?You don't like it? I thought you went for this stuff.Wait ... wait ... I want to tell you about the thing... the thing that will drop from the ceiling... in case the cabin suddenly depressurizes -- oho...What are we doing here?I want to be in bed.Yes ... that's all I ever think about ... You and me. Your body near mine, close. I'm not right when you're not with me. I get the shakes. And each time, when I first see you, I shake even more. For a while. And then I get calm. I feel safe ... I've never been this way. I can't remember how I lived before.Don't say it, if you don't mean it. Please, Ned, don't.I'm going to tell Edmund I want a divorce. I won't stay any longer. I would have, if you hadn't come along. The life is comfortable. I was willing to go on. But you've reminded me of what it can be... I know now that these last three years I've been living half a life. It's my fault, I don't deny it. You have to let yourself be bought. I did. I let it happen. I've lived so much of my life with nothing. When you have no money, you have no choices. I don't care what they say -- money is freedom. That's something they don't teach you in school. But I found out. And when Edmund came along when I saw a chance to stop struggling I took it. I'm not ashamed.He got what he wanted... he has a knack for that. But no more. I'm ready to walk away from the money. I have to be with you.Oh, I know you will, darling. I didn't mean that. I know you will. But it doesn't matter. It's you I want. That's all.Of the divorce?No. I signed a pre-nuptial agreement.He insisted. He blamed it on his sister Roz -- she's always hated me -- but I know he wanted it too.Bad. I get some money for a year. Not much. That's it. But I don't care, Ned. Not if I can be with you.Does it matter, Ned? Tell me the truth please. I'll understand, I swear to you.God, you've made me happy. It's time for your present.From now on, when it starts coming down on you, I'll be there to protect you.Put it on! I'll bet I guessed the size right.I love it.Look in my eyes. Can you see yourself?Here!Come to me.No... I couldn't.I saw the will once. He showed it to me. He was trying to prove something ... how much he loved me or something.The stock market, investments, real estate. He doesn't tell me anything, but I've picked up a little. I know they own a lot of land along the shore here.He's never introduced me to anyone. I'm not sure if they're all legitimate.They own that old place in Miranda Beach, The Breakers... I know that.Edmund mentioned it once.Ned, it scares me to talk about these things.You know.Let's just not, okay? Let's not think about all he's got.I'm afraid... because when I think about it, I wish that he'd die. That's really what I want. It's horrible and ugly and It's what I most want.What do you mean?Don't talk about it, Ned. Please don't. Talk is dangerous. Sometimes it makes things happen, it makes it real.I'm afraid, Ned.Hello.Darling, I'd like you to meet Mr. Racine. I'm sorry. I don't know your first name.Mr. Racine is the lawyer I told you about. You remember. He had a client who wanted to buy the house. I told him we weren't selling.Edmund, really. It's Mr. Racine's profession.Edmund's company owns The Breakers.I'm too dumb. Woman, you know.I'll be right back.I waited till I saw her leave. Please don't be angry with me.It didn't lock. Oh. Ned, hold me. Please just hold me, God, I love you.He left this morning. I had to see you.I couldn't call. I'm afraid to call. I was afraid you wouldn't let me come.I'm careful. I hated it, Ned. I hated sitting there with the two of you. I thought I was going to scream.No, never.I went to phone booths. I'm afraid of him, Ned. I'm always afraid.Why, Ned, why do you say this now?Why, Ned? What's happened?It's real, then?I thought we settled that. I'll wait in the car, but -- -- I want to take the risks with you. We're both doing this.I don't know why he's so crazy about her. Maybe because he never had any of his own. She's a cute little girl, all right, but other than that... I know this, though, her mother has worked plenty hard to keep Heather on Edmund's mind, Always bringing her around, reporting everything she does in school. That Roz is a smart one. And you know that anything Heather inherits goes straight to Roz. Heather won't even get a look at it. That's the part I can't stand. That's why it seems so wrong to have half of it go to her.Are you sure, Ned? I've been thinking about it. Maybe there is. The will is with his lawyer in Miami I know that. What if I could get him to bring it home? He did it once, he'd do it again. If I could swing it, couldn't we rewrite it? Change it. Then when he dies, I could find the new one. We could just change it a little. Every little change would mean a lot to us, End. You're a lawyer. You know how to write it. It wouldn't seem so odd. I could say he brought it home and we talked about it and decided to make some changes up here. And I knew you already --I just don't see why Heather should take half --You're right, darling. I'm sorry. I know you're right.Be careful.I love you.The side door.Two A.M. I send him down.I'm so frightened.Heather. What a surprise.What are you doing?Edmund.I can't sleep, either.Lock the door, darling.I'll go down with you.Edmund... wait!Put on a robe or something. What if Heather wakes up and comes down.She can do whatever she wants.My God, you scared me. You shouldn't be here. Heather's still here. She's upstairs.I miss you so badly. But it's too dangerous.You're all wet.She did.Any time, Roz. She's a pleasure.It is me.Why haven't you answered your phone?He's not coming up this weekend. Why haven't you answered?Can I get in with you?I don't know what Heather will tell Roz. Maybe nothing. Maybe she'll be embarrassed or afraid. Maybe she'll think she imagined the whole thing.We'll know if she does tell. Roz will report to Edmund quick enough. It's exactly what she's always wanted.I've been thinking, too.I think we should give it up. We haven't done anything criminal, yet.That's right. I don't think we can do it.Things have already started to go wrong. I feel like we got to the edge and looked over and, well, it was too much. We'll just have to live with that.I'll divorce him. And we won't have his money. Part of me wants it so bad. I'd be lying if I said I didn't. But it's the worst part of me, the weakest part.All that matters is that we're together.It's not you, it's us. I'm sure I'll make some mistake.Yes it is.No, darling. Don't talk that way. It's not true.You're wrong. Don't think that, ever! I know you could do it. But all I care about is you. The money doesn't matter.Why torture ourselves about it?Friday.Is that what you really want? Are you sure?What's wrong?Are you sure?Should I call the police?Edmund, what's that?I've never seen that.Edmund, be careful!He has a gun!Thank god. I thought --Thank you, Mr. Racine.Mary Ann is a lifelong friend of mine. She happened to be visiting on her way to Europe. I'm sure when she returns she'll get in touch with me.Yes, what does all this mean?So... what happens now?No, I don't.My god. You mean... it's all mine?My god.Of course, of course, I understand. Of course.... Of course...I've missed you so badly. I need you.Please stop. I don't blame you for hating me right now.Will you come to the house tonight?I want you more right now than I ever have. I know how you must feel about me. But please come tonight.I know. I know. I know you'd probably like to kill me. I know. But please... you can hate me... punish me... hurt me if you want, but don't talk yet.Please, Ned.... Mary Ann and I left Wheaton together and went to Chicago. We didn't know what we were doing. I got in bad trouble with drugs. Speed. Really bad. I did things... Whatever's the evilest thing you can think of me now, I did worse things then. There's nothing lower than the animal I was then. Worse than you can imagine. I thought I would die. I prayed I would... And then a man helped me. He got me clean. He didn't want much in return, either... He was a lawyer and he put me to work in his office. I learned a lot there. One time I even thought I might go to law school. ... That's where I picked up the business about making a will invalid. That happened to him once. I swear I would never have used that if I'd known about your case... I was afraid to tell you, Ned. I knew you wouldn't let me do it. I'm greedy, like you said. I wanted us to have it all.I don't blame you for thinking I'm bad. I am. I know it. I'd understand if you just cut me off now. If you never trusted me again. You'd probably be smart. But you must believe one thing. I love you. I love you and need you. I want to be with you forever.I don't care.There's nothing we can do about it now. In a little while we'll either have the money or we won't. It's out of our hands.I fired the housekeeper. We can stay together as long as we want. We're all alone here now.I swear to you, I don't. What's wrong with you?I must have missed them. I wasn't looking for them. I thought they were on Edmund.I don't know. Betty!She might have taken them.Listen to me. That's why I fired her. After Edmund's death she started acting strange. She was always watching me, listening to my calls.No, Ned, not with her I wasn't. I could tell there was a difference. Maybe she know about us. Maybe she wants something.I don't know what to think. I'm worried. But it's not about the glasses. Or your friends. It's us.Your first reaction is to accuse me. What's happening to you? I don't know if we can hold on like this.Hardin called today. He said everything should be cleared up by next week. I'll get the money He apologized for the delay.But they haven't been able to. Soon it'll be all ours. That's why we've got to hold together, Ned. It won't be long, then we'll get away from here. Out from under all this. All we have is each other. I'd kill myself if I thought this thing would destroy us. I couldn't take it.Hello, Ned. Can we talk?I'm in Miami. I've been running around like crazy and I could reach you before I left.I've got the money. I've taken it and sent it somewhere safe. It's all ours now. But that's not the best part.The glasses. I got them back. That is, they should be ours by now. Betty had them. She wanted money. That's why I had to come down here. She made it all very difficult, but I think it worked out.No. She wouldn't do that. She's putting them in the boathouse. In the top drawer of the dresser in the boathouse. They should be there now, if she's kept up her end.I think you'd better get them right away. I don't trust her.That's right. The top drawer of the dresser. Oh. Ned, we're going to be all right. I'll leave here as soonas I can. I should be there by seven- thirty. I can't wait to see you, darling. We've made it.Are you all right?Good-bye, sweetheart.Hello, darling.Where's your car?Why haven't you turned on the lights?It's all ours now, Ned. We could leave tonight if we wanted. It's over.What's this --?What is it, Ned? What's happened?No. I swear to you, I don't!Weren't they there? Didn't she bring them?She promised she'd bring them.Ned, I don't know what you think, but you're wrong. I haven't done anything to hurt you. I love you. You've got to believe me.I did arrange to meet you. But, Ned, it all changed. You changed it. I fell in love with you. I didn't plan that...How can I prove it to you? What can I say?But you said they weren't there.I'll go, Ned. I'll go and look for them.Ned... no matter what you think, I do love you.What?Yes.", "clean_line": "married woman meaning looking company business happy smart like man look lazy tell chat like work
