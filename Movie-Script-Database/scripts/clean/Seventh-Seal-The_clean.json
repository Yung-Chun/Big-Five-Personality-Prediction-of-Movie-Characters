{"Seventh-Seal-The": {"KNIGHT": {"raw_line": "Who are you?Have you come for me?That I know.My body is frightened, but I am not.Wait a moment.You play chess, don't you?I have seen it in paintings and heard it sung in ballads.But you can't be better than I am.I have my reasons.The condition is that I may live as long as I hold out against you. If I win, you will release me. Is it agreed?You drew black!Well, did he show you the way?What did he say?Was he a mute?Oh?Must you sing?I want to talk to you as openly as I can, but my heart is empty.The emptiness is a mirror turned towards my own face. I see myself in it, and I am filled with fear and disgust.Through my indifference to my fellow men, I have isolated myself from their company. Now I live in a world of phantoms. I am imprisoned in my dreams and fantasies.Yes, I do.I want knowledge.Call it whatever you like. Is it so cruelly inconceivable to grasp God with the senses? Why should He hide himself in a mist of half-spoken promises and unseen miracles?How can we have faith in those who believe when we can't have faith in ourselves? What is going to happen to those of us who want to believe but aren't able to? And what is to become of those who neither want to nor are capable of believing?Why can't I kill God within me? Why does He live on in this painful and humiliating way even though I curse Him and want to tear Him out of my heart? Why, in spite of everything, is He a baffling reality that I can't shake off? Do you hear me?I want knowledge, not faith, not suppositions, but knowledge. I want God to stretch out His hand towards me, reveal Himself and speak to me.I call out to Him in the dark but no one seems to be there.Then life is an outrageous horror. No one can live in the face of death, knowing that all is nothingness.But one day they will have to stand at that last moment of life and look towards the darkness.In our fear, we make an image, and that image we call God.Death visited me this morning. We are playing chess together. This reprieve gives me the chance to arrange an urgent matter.My life has been a futile pursuit, a wandering, a great deal of talk without meaning. I feel no bitterness or self-reproach because the lives of most people are very much like this. But I will use my reprieve for one meaningful deed.He is a clever opponent, but up to now I haven't lost a single man.I use a combination of the bishop and the knight which he hasn't yet discovered. In the next move I'll shatter one of his flanks.You've tricked and cheated me! But we'll meet again, and I'll find a way.This is my hand. I can move it, feel the blood pulsing through it. The sun is still high in the sky and I, Antonius Block, am playing chess with Death.Have you seen the Devil?Can that be so dangerous?I understand.Yes, yes.What's his name?How old is he?He's big for his age.You played some kind of show this afternoon.You are more beautiful now without your face painted, and this gown is more becoming.Is that your husband?Oh, that one.Do you do tricks also?Is Mikael going to be an acrobat?But you don't.Let me assure you, that's no pleasure either.No.Yes.I have dull company.No, not him.Myself.Do you, really?Good evening.I have just told your wife that you have a splendid son. He'll bring great joy to you.Thank you, I don't want anything.Where are you going next?I wouldn't advise you to go there.The plague has spread in that direction, following the coast line south. It's said that people are dying by the tens of thousands.May I suggest ... ... that you follow me through the forest tonight and stay at my home if you like. Or go along the east coast. You'll probably be safer there.I humbly thank you.For a short while.People are troubled by so much.Yes, I think I had someone.I don't know.We were newly married and we played together. We laughed a great deal. I wrote songs to her eyes, to her nose, to her beautiful little ears. We went hunting together and at night we danced. The house was full of life ...Faith is a torment, did you know that? It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call.Everything I've said seems meaningless and unreal while I sit here with you and your husband. How unimportant it all becomes suddenly.I shall remember this moment. The silence, the twilight, the bowls of strawberries and milk, your faces in the evening light. Mikael sleeping, Jof with his lyre. I'll try to remember what we have talked about. I'll carry this memory between my hands as carefully as if it were a bowl filled to the brim with fresh milk.And it will be an adequate sign -- it will be enough for me.Pardon me. I was detained for a few moments. Because I revealed my tactics to you, I'm in retreat. It's your move.That's my secret.You did the right thing.Of course. You fell right in the trap. Check!Don't worry about my laughter; save your king instead.Our game amuses me.I understand that you've a lot to do, but you can't get out of our game. It takes time.Why do you ask?I see that they have hurt your hands.I have a potion that will stop your pain.What's your name?How old are you?And is it true that you have been in league with the Devil?They say that you have been in league with the Devil.Not out of curiosity, but for very personal reasons. I too want to meet him.I want to ask him about God. He, if anyone, must know.How?I see fear in your eyes, an empty, numb fear. But nothing else.No.No, there is no one there.Has he told you this?Has he said it?Why have you crushed her hands?Who did?What have you done with the child?No, I'll never stop.Take this and it will stop the pain.She feels no more pain.This cannot be.No.Your move!I didn't notice that.Lost interest? On the contrary.Nothing escapes you -- or does it?It's true that I'm worried.I've forgotten how the pieces stood.What do you see?That's true.Yes, I did.And you will divulge your secrets.So you know nothing.It's over now and I'm a little tired.Over there stand my friends.Was someone there?Good morning, noble lord.From our darkness, we call out to Thee, Lord.

Two horses had eaten each other in the night, and, in the churchyard, graves had been opened and the remains of corpses scattered all over the place. Yesterday afternoon there were as many as four suns in the heavens.Not exactly.Nothing.No, sir, I wouldn't say that. As a matter of fact, he was quite eloquent.He was eloquent, all right. The trouble is that what he had to say was most depressing. One moment you're bright and lively, The next you're crawling with worms. Fate is a terrible villain And you, my friend, its poor victim.No.What is this supposed to represent?And that one is Death?Why do you paint such nonsense?Well, it's not going to make them feel any happier.Then they'll close their eyes and refuse to look at your painting.If you do scare them ...And if they think ...And then they'll run right into the arms of the priests.You're only painting your Dance of Death.Just think how some people will curse you.The plague. That sounds horrible.That looks terrible.Scare? Me? You don't know me. What are the horrors you've painted over there?Do they really whip themselves?Do you have any brandy? I've been drinking water all day and it's made me as thirsty as a camel in the desert.Me and my master have been abroad and have just come home. Do you understand, you little pictor?Precisely. For ten years we sat in the Holy Land and let snakes bite us, flies sting us, wild animals eat us, heathens butcher us, the wine poison us, the women give us lice, the lice devour us, the fevers rot us, all for the Glory of God. Our crusade was such madness that only a real idealist could have thought it up. But what you said about the plague was horrible.Ah, me. No matter which way you turn, you have your rump behind you. That's the truth.This is squire J\u0088ns. He grins at Death, mocks the Lord, laughs at himself and leers at the girls. His world is a J\u0088nsworld, believable only to himself, ridiculous to all including himself, meaningless to Heaven and of no interest to Hell.That soup of yours has a hell of a stink. What is it good for?And now she's in the stocks.And you do that with this stinking mess?Neither can I.I recognize you, although it's a long time since we met. Your name is Raval, from the theological college at Roskilde. You are Dr. Mirabilis, Coelestis et Diabilis.Am I not right?You were the one who, ten years ago, convinced my master of the necessity to join a better- class crusade to the Holy Land.You look uncomfortable. Do you have a stomach- ache?When I see you, I suddenly understand the meaning of these ten years, which previously seemed to me such a waste. Our life was too good and we were too satisfied with ourselves. The Lord wanted to punish us for our complacency. That is why He sent you to spew out your holy venom and poison the knight.But now you know better, don't you? Because now you have turned into a thief. A more fitting and rewarding occupation for scoundrels. Isn't that so?By all means. I'm not bloodthirsty.I don't have the heart to touch you, Doctor. But remember this: the next time we meet, I'll brand your face the way one does with thieves. What I really came for is to get my waterskin filled.J\u0088ns is my name. I am a pleasant and talkative young man who has never had anything but kind thoughts and has only done beautiful and noble deeds. I'm kindest of all to young women. With them, there is no limit to my kindness.Goodbye, my girl. I could very well have raped you, but between you and me, I'm tired of that kind of love. It runs a little dry in the end.Now that I think of it, I will need a housekeeper. Can you prepare good food? As far as I know, I'm still a married man, but I have high hopes that my wife is dead by now. That's why I need a housekeeper. The devil with it! Come along and don't stand there staring. I've saved your life, so you owe me a great deal.This damned ranting about doom. Is that food for the minds of modern people? Do they really expect us to take them seriously?Yes, now you grin at me, my lord. But allow me to point out that I've either read, heard or experienced most of the tales which we people tell each other.Even the ghost stories about God the Father, the angels, Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost -- all these I've accepted without too much emotion.My little stomach is my world, my head is my eternity, and my hands, two wonderful suns. My legs are time's damned pendulums, and my dirty feet are two splendid starting points for my philosophy. Everything is worth precisely as much as a belch, the only difference being that a belch is more satisfying.What are you screaming about?That's possible.No, I haven't. But if I had seen her and she looked like you, I'd quickly forget that I'd seen her.Maybe she's run off.I know quite a lot, but not about your wife. Go to the inn. Maybe they can help you.Do you remember what I was going to do to you if we met again?I'm a man who keeps his word.By all means. I write little songs myself. For example, I know a very funny song about a wanton fish which I doubt that you've heard yet.You'll not get to hear it either. There are persons here who don't appreciate my art and I don't want to upset anyone. I'm a sensitive soul.God in heaven, isn't this Plog, the smith?Are you sitting here sniveling in loneliness?If I were in your boots, I'd be happy to get rid of a wife in such an easy way.I! A hundred times and more. I can't keep count of all my wives any longer. But it's often that way when you're a traveling man.Yes, it's hell with women and hell without them. So, however you look at it, it's still best to kill them off while it's most amusing.Why don't you kiss me good night?Why don't you love me the way you did when we first met?You only turn your back and snore.Oh hell. And now she's gone. Rejoice!Look how he howls again.So, maybe you love her! Then, you poor misguided ham shank, I'll tell you that love is another word for lust, plus lust, plus lust and a damn lot of cheating, falseness, lies and all kinds of other fooling around.Of course. Love is the blackest of all plagues, and if one could die of it, there would be some pleasure in love. But you almost always get over it.Yes, you too. There are only a couple of poor wretches who die of love once in a while. Love is as contagious as a cold in the nose. It eats away at your strength, your independence, your morale, if you have any. If everything is imperfect in this imperfect world, love is most perfect in its perfect imperfection.Believe! Who said that I believed it? But I love to give good advice. If you ask me for advice you'll get two pieces for the price of one, because after all I really am an educated man.Only if you don't whimper all the time, because in that case we'll all have to avoid you.Yes, but now he's just sniveling.That's good. Now we can see the road better.That's because there's no wind.If one could hear a fox at least.Or a human voice besides one's own.Where are you going?Yes, now I can see. It's the girl who has done it with the Black One. The witch?Why do you burn her at this time of night? People have so few diversions these days.You are eight brave men, then.For a moment I thought of killing the soldiers, but it would do no good. She's nearly dead already.What does she see? Can you tell me?You don't answer my question. Who watches over that child? Is it the angels, or God, or the Devil, or only the emptiness? Emptiness, my lord!Look at her eyes, my lord. Her poor brain has just made a discovery. Emptiness under the moon.We stand powerless, our arms hanging at our sides, because we see what she sees, and our terror and hers are the same. That poor little child. I can't stand it, I can't stand it ...Don't scream. What came over you?Now it starts again.Get up, you tear-drenched pig. We'll lose the others.Saints almighty, stop! You're a very bad poet, despite the fact that you're drunk. And your vegetable garden bores me.Do you see something?I don't see anything.Hell, he's an actor.We must go on.Soon dawn will come, but the heat continues to hang over us like a smothering blanket.Maybe it's the day of judgment.Don't come here. If you do I'll slit your throat. Keep to the other side of the tree.It's no use. It's no use. I know that it's no use. It's meaningless. It's totally meaningless. I tell you that it's meaningless. Can't you hear that I'm consoling you?No, my lord. I saw no one.In the darkness where You are supposed to be, where all of us probably are.... In the darkness You will find no one to listen to Your cries or be touched by Your sufferings. Wash Your tears and mirror Yourself in Your indifference.I could have given you an herb to purge you of your worries about eternity. Now it seems to be too late. But in any case, feel the immense triumph of this last minute when you can still roll your eyes and move your toes.I shall be silent, but under protest.", "clean_line": "strumpet legs lie life sigh god almighty far away brother devil meet level rjestad talking evil omens horrible things horses eaten night churchyard graves opened remains corpses scattered place yesterday afternoon suns heavens exactly sir wouldn matter fact eloquent eloquent right trouble depressing moment bright lively crawling worms fate terrible villain friend poor victim supposed represent death paint nonsense going feel happier ll close eyes refuse look painting scare think ll run right arms priests painting dance death think people curse plague sounds horrible looks terrible scare know horrors ve painted whip brandy ve drinking water day thirsty camel desert master abroad come home understand little pictor precisely years sat holy land let snakes bite flies sting wild animals eat heathens butcher wine poison women lice lice devour fevers rot glory god crusade madness real idealist thought said plague horrible ah matter way turn rump truth squire ns grins death mocks lord laughs leers girls world nsworld believable ridiculous including meaningless heaven hell soup hell stink good stocks stinking mess recognize long time met raval theological college roskilde dr mirabilis coelestis et diabilis right years ago convinced master necessity join better class crusade holy land look uncomfortable stomach ache suddenly understand meaning years previously waste life good satisfied lord wanted punish complacency sent spew holy venom poison knight know better turned thief fitting rewarding occupation scoundrels isn means bloodthirsty heart touch doctor remember time meet ll brand face way thieves came waterskin filled ns pleasant talkative young man kind thoughts beautiful noble deeds kindest young women limit kindness goodbye girl raped tired kind love runs little dry end think need housekeeper prepare good food far know married man high hopes wife dead need housekeeper devil come stand staring ve saved life owe great deal damned ranting doom food minds modern people expect seriously yes grin lord allow point ve read heard experienced tales people tell ghost stories god father angels jesus christ holy ghost ve accepted emotion little stomach world head eternity hands wonderful suns legs time damned pendulums dirty feet splendid starting points philosophy worth precisely belch difference belch satisfying screaming possible haven seen looked like quickly forget seen maybe run know lot wife inn maybe help remember going met man keeps word means write little songs example know funny song wanton fish doubt ve heard ll hear persons appreciate art want upset sensitive soul god heaven isn plog smith sitting sniveling loneliness boots happy rid wife easy way times count wives longer way traveling man yes hell women hell look best kill amusing kiss good night love way met turn snore oh hell gone rejoice look howls maybe love poor misguided ham shank ll tell love word lust plus lust plus lust damn lot cheating falseness lies kinds fooling course love blackest plagues die pleasure love yes couple poor wretches die love love contagious cold nose eats away strength independence morale imperfect imperfect world love perfect perfect imperfection believe said believed love good advice ask advice ll pieces price educated man whimper time case ll avoid yes sniveling good road better wind hear fox human voice going yes girl black witch burn time night people diversions days brave men moment thought killing soldiers good nearly dead tell answer question watches child angels god devil emptiness emptiness lord look eyes lord poor brain discovery emptiness moon stand powerless arms hanging sides sees terror poor little child stand stand scream came starts tear drenched pig ll lose saints almighty stop bad poet despite fact drunk vegetable garden bores hell actor soon dawn come heat continues hang like smothering blanket maybe day judgment come ll slit throat tree use use know use meaningless totally meaningless tell meaningless hear consoling lord saw darkness supposed probably darkness listen cries touched sufferings wash tears mirror indifference given herb purge worries eternity late case feel immense triumph minute roll eyes toes shall silent protest"}}}
