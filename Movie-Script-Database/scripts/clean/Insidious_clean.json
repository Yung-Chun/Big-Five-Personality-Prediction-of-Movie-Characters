{"Insidious": {"RENAI": {"raw_line": "What are you doing up, kiddo?You'll get used to it. It's only your first night.Argh, I'm going to eat you.Just some photos.Do you know who that is?That's me.I know. I'm so happy there. But it's me. When I was your age. I was a kid once too, you know.Thanks. Maybe you're right...I don't remember being this person at all. I hope she smiled like that all the time, whoever she was.This is a terrible thing to admit, Dalton, but sometimes I get jealous of you. That you're so young. That you haven't made any of your decisions yet.Well, it starts happening to us from the moment we're born.Every time that clock ticks, we all get a little bit older.That's your grandpa. You wouldn't remember him.Yeah...good memory. He did smoke that god awful pipe, didn't he?I don't even know if we have any. He's hopeless with keeping photos.Your pictures are all in the computer. Nobody keeps photo albums like this anymore, they're ancient relics. They should. I like being able to touch something, instead of it floating around in cyber world. If the laptop breaks, your whole existence is erased.You are a little kid.If only you knew what I know.You certainly didn't cry as much as your little sister does. Come on.Billing department.Billing department.Make it work. Speak to an agent. Speak to an agent. Speak to an agent.Well, I'd like to keep the old number if I could. You really need to learn how to do this, honey.Okay, well, please let me know by the end of today, I have to give the number out. Thank you.Foster, get up. Now.You woke me up.You were snoring.Yes you were.Yes you do.How would you know what you do? You're asleep.Where are my bleeping pills?Yes.Yes.Where are my pills, Josh?That's not where I left them.Oh, geez. Look, just...take last night's dinner.It's all we have. Just for today, honey.And while I've got you, if you're going to look at my books, please don't leave them all over the floor.Are you taking the boys to school?Well can you pick them up after school?But I have stuff I wanted to...Yeah, I'm looking west, always been looking that way, gonna get it all happening, just can't do it today...Yeah, I'm looking west, always been looking that way, I'm gonna be somebody, I just can't be her today--Josh, where's the box of my lamps?Yeah, I packed them. They're not here.Well, they're not here. I would know, I've been unpacking this stuff all day.Dalton? Where are you?Dalton?Dalton, you have to be careful. You shouldn't be coming down here in the dark.If I catch you falling down the stairs again I'm gonna break your neck.Sleep tight, honey.He's such a boy. He goes off exploring. Sometimes I wanna keep him on one of those child leashes.I'm sorry I was pissy when you got home. I was trying to work on a song today and then Cali woke up and wouldn't stop crying...I feel guilty for wanting my own time.Is it? My mother gave up everything for me. I keep waiting for the completely selfless parent gene to kick in, but I'm exactly the same person I was when I was 22, only now I'm married with kids.No, I'm not. They like you so much better than me.You're the cool dad who comes home with presents and I'm the one who yells at them all day.Believe me, you're their hero. They try to play us off against each other. They're master manipulators. I guess they really are my kids.Is this it, Josh?Thank you for letting me take some time off to work on my music again.There's a couple of songs...I mean not all of them, but there's a couple of them that I think are really good. And I think, maybe I could do something with them.Foster, sit down honey.Where is...? Hey Josh, could you go wake up Dalton?He can't just not wake up...there's got to be something...It's okay.Did he respond to any of the tests?He's not in a coma, remember? They don't know what to call it. They don't know what to do with him so they've given up.What's this?That's today's date. You got this today?Why didn't you tell us, honey?I know it's hard right now. But things will get better. I promise.I'm going to show this to your dad.Scared of what?We're all scared. It's normal to be scared for him. But we can't give up--Why would you wanna change rooms?Your brother needs you. Goodnight honey.Something happened today. I didn't want to tell you in front of Foster.I heard something coming from Cali's room. A man's voice. On the baby monitor...it scared the hell outta me. I went in there and no one was there.I don't know. It was so clear. I was sitting at the piano and I heard this...whispering on the baby monitor. So I held my ear up to it--Who was it, Josh?There's someone in there!There's someone in Cali's room!Josh! The laundry!I saw somebody.No. It wasn't a shadow, it was a man. He was tall, and he long, greasy hair. He was wearing a grey jacket. He looked right at me.Yeah.Of course. Anything from Dalton?I won't, I just...I haven't slept much the last couple of nights. I feel like the universe is trying to see how far I can bend before I break.Thanks, Kelly. You're a saint.It's midnight, Josh.You've been coming home late every single night. You've never had to do that in all of the years you've been at the school. Now all of a sudden you have to stay back late?Your mother is paying Dalton's bills, Josh. I know because she reminds me every chance she gets.You're projecting that onto me. You've written an entire story about I'm how I'm feeling without once asking me how I'm feeling.I am losing my mind here in this house, Josh. I'm scared and I need you and you're not here. Where are you?I don't mean that. I mean you're not here. With me. In this situation. You're avoiding it, like you do anything stressful, whether it's this or a parking ticket.There you go again.Jo....osh....Josh....Josh...The man -- he was there -- he tried to -- there was a man there!!!I saw somebody!Don't you dare not believe me!I want you to tell me that we can leave this house. I will not spend one more night here. I wanna leave, I wanna go!I'm sorry. I can't...I want to leave this house. I can't be here anymore.Please, Josh.Lorraine, you shouldn't have to do any of this. Sit down.I know, but I just feel so bad.I can't believe we're doing all this again, that's what I can't believe. I know you think I'm crazy.We just wanna say...thank you so much. For helping us out with this, doctor. We can't tell you how much it means to have you involved.So there's hope?Oh my God, Dalton...no...Josh, this is Liam Nathanson. A very old friend of mine.Thanks, Liam.There's no use, Lorraine. He's been drinking.He would never speak to me like that before.You're an asshole.This...thing that was in the other house. It followed us.I saw someone again today. In the house. It looked like a young boy. I followed it into Dalton's room... but it wasn't a child. This thing is here. I know it.I didn't know what else to do.No. It was mine.I'm scared.I told you...Help us...So is Elise coming or...?Okay...Ah...sure.No. I mean, our son...Yes.No.I take anti-depressants sometimes.Not a history. I've had bouts of it. In the past.Hi. I'm Renai.Yes. Of course.What is it for?What is it?What is it? What do you see?What do you see?!Tell me!Go on.I don't understand...Out of body experiences?Lost? Lost where?What do you mean?How many are there?Is there a way to bring Dalton back?You said that you'd give her a chance!Why did we go to all the trouble of bringing them here if you're just going to reject what they say?Josh, you're not being fair...You never believed me...No, please...don't go.I don't know...I don't believe anything anymore, Josh. I used to. I used to believe that I could keep my children safe. I used to believe everything would be okay. To believe in something, you have to know it to be true.The things that have happened to me haven't confirmed any beliefs - they've done the opposite. They've made me question what I believe.They've made me realize that maybe we don't know as much as we think we do.You ask me if I believe what she said to be true and the answer is I don't know. But let me ask you this - in your heart of hearts, can you say for certain that it isn't?Dalton!Dalton! Dalton!I want you to know something...you have never been less than good enough for me. You've always been perfect for me. You're my best friend...my soulmate. I love you so much.What's happening to him?!Help him!What happens now?Josh, follow my voice...Follow my voice. Come back to us.Find us...Hurry! Come back to us!Find us!Josh? Josh?I don't know what to say...Too bad. I'm never letting you go to sleep again.Did you know we'd come and find you?Whenever you're lost...we'll always come and find you.What was that? Stay here.Elise, what was that noise?Jesus...what happened to you?Where's Josh? Josh? Josh?!Elise, what happened? You're scaring me, tell me where Josh is?", "clean_line": "kiddo ll night argh going eat photos know know happy age kid know thanks maybe right remember person hope smiled like time terrible thing admit dalton jealous young haven decisions starts happening moment born time clock ticks little bit older grandpa wouldn remember yeah good memory smoke god awful pipe know hopeless keeping photos pictures keeps photo albums like anymore ancient relics like able touch instead floating cyber world laptop breaks existence erased little kid knew know certainly little sister come billing department billing department work speak agent speak agent speak agent like old number need learn honey okay let know end today number thank foster woke snoring yes yes know asleep bleeping pills yes yes pills josh left oh geez look night dinner today honey ve got going look books leave floor taking boys school pick school stuff wanted yeah looking west looking way gonna happening today yeah looking west looking way gonna somebody today josh box lamps yeah packed know ve unpacking stuff day dalton dalton dalton careful shouldn coming dark catch falling stairs gonna break neck sleep tight honey boy goes exploring wanna child leashes sorry pissy got home trying work song today cali woke wouldn stop crying feel guilty wanting time mother gave waiting completely selfless parent gene kick exactly person married kids like better cool dad comes home presents yells day believe hero try play master manipulators guess kids josh thank letting time work music couple songs mean couple think good think maybe foster sit honey hey josh wake dalton wake got okay respond tests coma remember know know ve given today date got today tell honey know hard right things better promise going dad scared scared normal scared wanna change rooms brother needs goodnight honey happened today want tell foster heard coming cali room man voice baby monitor scared hell outta went know clear sitting piano heard whispering baby monitor held ear josh cali room josh laundry saw somebody wasn shadow man tall long greasy hair wearing grey jacket looked right yeah course dalton won haven slept couple nights feel like universe trying far bend break thanks kelly saint midnight josh ve coming home late single night ve years ve school sudden stay late mother paying dalton bills josh know reminds chance gets projecting ve written entire story feeling asking feeling losing mind house josh scared need mean mean situation avoiding like stressful parking ticket jo osh josh josh man tried man saw somebody dare believe want tell leave house spend night wanna leave wanna sorry want leave house anymore josh lorraine shouldn sit know feel bad believe believe know think crazy wanna thank helping doctor tell means involved hope oh god dalton josh liam nathanson old friend thanks liam use lorraine drinking speak like asshole thing house followed saw today house looked like young boy followed dalton room wasn child thing know know scared told help elise coming okay ah sure mean son yes anti depressants history ve bouts past hi renai yes course tell understand body experiences lost lost mean way bring dalton said chance trouble bringing going reject josh fair believed know believe anymore josh believe children safe believe okay believe know true things happened haven confirmed beliefs ve opposite ve question believe ve realize maybe know think ask believe said true answer know let ask heart hearts certain isn dalton dalton dalton want know good ve perfect best friend soulmate love happening help happens josh follow voice follow voice come hurry come josh josh know bad letting sleep know come lost ll come stay elise noise jesus happened josh josh josh elise happened scaring tell josh"}, "JOSH": {"raw_line": "Every time I think I've pulled you out...you grow back in.Ouch!Don't eat on the floor, buddy.How come you were up so early? Was Cali crying?What do you mean?No I wasn't.I don't snore.My father snored. I do not snore.Good one, champ. I don't snore, do I?What the heck is this? Wax?!Let me get this straight - we have no actual fruit but we have wax fruit?That is dangerous. It could kill one of our kids.Probably where you left them, Renai.See.Check it first, Dalton. It's probably made out of Styrofoam.I gotta go.No time.Not today.Alanso, please sit down.Si\u00e9ntate, por favor.Come on guys, quieten down.Thank you, Teri. Today we are going to talk about Darwin. It's a city in Australia, but it's also the last name of which famous naturalist?Correct. Does anybody know what he is famous for?Half right. He wrote a seminal book that explained his theories on natural selection, and how the different species on this planet - including humans - evolved.Humans actually have a lot in common with monkeys, or more specifically, chimpanzees.I respect your right to believe that, Alanso. But I want to give you all possible theories. I want this class to go out into the world with an informed opinion.How can it be incorrect? It's a theory. A scientific theory.Alanso, if you keep talking like that I'm going to ask you to visit the principal.Look at this. Nice job.Whoa, buddy. Slow down.I don't know. They should be here. We packed them up.I remember the movers bringing them in and putting them right there.What happened?Where do you hurt the most?You scared us, champ.You're lucky you don't need stitches.We've gotta lock that door.Why bother with a child leash? I'll stop at the pet store tomorrow.I didn't even notice.It's normal to want your own time.You're a great mother.That's not true.Now you're being crazy. They love you. At least you get to connect with them. I work so much.Is this so bad?We'll get by. I want you to do it.I love all your songs.Time to get up, my man. Come on.You're making me look bad here. Outta bed before your mother comes in and kills both of us.Dalton, get up. You've gotta get ready for school.Dalton...?Dalton? Dalton?! DALTON!!So...there's no brain damage or...?That fall he took...I mean, it looked like he hit his head pretty hard.So what do we do now? Does he stay here?She said dad...What?Could it have been interference?Who the hell is that?Stay here.Hello? Who's there?What did you say?Grab Cali and Foster!Uh...what?Just take it without me.No, you don't. Just take the damn photo without me, okay?What?Thank you, Alanso.I wish I had your belief. Things would be a lot simpler.Hey...I just found out I have to stay back tonight and finish off mid-term grades. It could be a while, there's a lot to go through. Don't wait up. Bye.The men all walked down to the waters edge...and they stood there and asked the beast to come forth. And the beast roared back \"No!\". And so they dived in after it...What are you doing up?When did you start smoking?I don't like it either, but I'm grading tests. What choice do I have? We've gotta pay Dalton's bills.Jesus, I can't win with you. That's my son in there too, not just yours!I've always felt like less than good enough for you. I feel it every time you mention our bills. That subtle voice that says `can't you get a job that pays more than a teacher'? And now I can't even look at you without feeling it.I don't need to ask. I know you.I told you, I'm grading tests.Christ, I should have stayed at the school.What is it? What is it?!Renai, what is wrong?!There's no one here.There's no one here.I believe you, okay? I just don't know what you want me to do.You're okay, buddy. I've got you.To move now would be...we would have to rent somewhere. It's not--So...if you're the top of the food chain with this stuff, where does that leave us?Sorry to scare you.Where did all the bartenders who listen to your troubles go, Ned?I don't need whisky for that.I probably would too. It's funny, I've always known I was the type of person that things didn't happen to. I made peace with it. I thought to myself, it's okay - I'll never win the lottery or climb Mount Everest...but I'll never get a rare tropical blood disease either. It works out. Now I'm the guy whose son is in a mysterious coma.This is the first line of a joke. Guy comes home to find his wife with a priest...Can't say I've heard the same, Liam. At least I know you're not sleeping with her.What is going on here?Okay, would anyone mind telling me what the hell is going on here?\"Joshua?\" Oh Jesus...The melodramatic way in which you two are conducting yourselves right now is scaring the shit out of me, so just tell me what's wrong.Nobody asks you to sit down unless something is wrong. If a doctor calls you into his office and asks you to sit down, you're fucked.I have not been drinking. Not enough that we can't talk to each other, Renai. And don't judge me in that bitchy tone, okay?Christ. You're acting like I'm some lush who comes home and beats you with a belt. At least I'm speaking to you. You suddenly have to speak to a priest. Or my mother who, up until a couple of weeks ago, you couldn't stand.So...what? You called in a priest to get rid of it?Are you kidding me? Was this your idea?You've never been to a church in your life. Now you're inviting a priest into our home? I feel like I don't even know you right now.This is a fantasy, and you need a therapist, not a member of the clergy.What is it?I don't know how.Yeah.Oh.This is a little uncomfortable. Speaking for myself. I'm not used to this kind of stuff.No. I'm sorry, I have to ask how this relates to our problem?What is that?Mrs. Rainier?Last saw me?Go ahead.No. No. This has gone too far.I have given her a chance, and I did that because I wanted to help you. But I cannot have somebody telling us that the reason our son is in a coma is because his soul is floating off somewhere in another dimension.No, it's not fair is what it is. You're preying on people's grief and vulnerability, which is really easy to do in a situation like this.Because I wanted to help you. To put your mind at ease, and if this helped, then great. But to drag Dalton into this? No.Fair? How did the voice of reason become the bad guy here? Don't you see? You want to believe. Of course you do, honey, anybody would.Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do. I really do. But I think it's dangerous to start throwing out false hope like this. I have to put my foot down. My wife is not...mentally well at the moment, and I have to keep at least one of her feet here in the real world.Honey, I'm on your side. But I genuinely think this is dangerous and frankly, a little exploitative.You come into a home with a seriously ill child, you make a tenuous connection between him and these experiences Renai is having and viola - the client starts crying because they're desperate to believe, the tears validate your power, thank you, that'll be six hundred dollars please.I know, I know...look, I appreciate your interest and your time. I do. Thank you. Thank you very much.Look at me for a second, honey. Look at me.Did you really believe what she said? In your heart of hearts, did you actually take what she was saying literally?Do you think I don't want to believe in that stuff? Of course I do. It would make life a lot easier if I did. If I believed that some supernatural force was responsible for what's happened to our son...Where are you? Where did you go? Can you hear me? I'm begging you to show me that you can hear me...I don't know how to help you. Please tell me what to do.Please God, please help me...give me my son back. I will do anything just to have him back.I need him back. I need him to show me that he can hear me. Please...Okay.Mom...what are you doing here?Why?Tell me what?What are you talking about?No...I've never...done that before.I don't...I don't remember any of this...Who is she?How long do we have before...that thing...takes him over completely?I love you too. I have since the first time you looked at me. I don't exist without you.This is useless...I have no idea what I'm doing and you just suddenly expect me to...Dalton?Dalton? Where are you?Dalton?Dalton?Where is Dalton?Do you know where Dalton is?Dalton? Where are you?I'm looking for my son, Dalton.DALTON!!!! WHERE ARE YOU?!!!DALTON!DALTON!!Get...off..me!Get away from me! Leave now!Dalton!!Dalton!Dalton...?I'm taking you back.What is it?You're not really here. You're asleep in your bed in our home. Just stand up.This isn't real.
