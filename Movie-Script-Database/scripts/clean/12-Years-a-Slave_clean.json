{"12-Years-a-Slave": {"SOLOMON": {"raw_line": "Come, Anne. Jump.I will catch you, Anne.Mr. Parker.We are in need of a fresh carry all for the Mrs's travels.Yes, certainly. Poor Mrs. Harris and her children. I hope brighter times ahead.If we could discuss the price...Shop well, but mind your wallet.No intrusion. Fitzgerald looks to Solomon. It is a cold glare as though he wasn't speaking to, and has no interest in a response from a black man. Looking back to Parker:\"Thus has passed away from earth our late President.\" Solomon starts from the top of the article.\"During the morning, from sunrise, the heavy bells had been pealing forth their slow and solemn toll while the minute guns announced that soon the grave would receive its trust. Our city as well as our entire nation has been called to weep over the fall of a great and good man. One who was by the wishes of a large majority of ourpeople raised to fill the highest place of trust within their gift. William Henry Harrison.\" A long moment of quiet, the family continuing to eat. Then, from Margaret:Margaret, that was wonderful.Alonzo, do you have something to say?Both of you, calm down. We will have our first lesson after this wonderful dinner. And on that note, let's start eating.I won't stay idle. SOLOMON's eyes lower.If only I didn't have to share your cooking with other people. ANNE holds his gaze.Travel safely.Mr. Moon is being overly gracious.A circus?Thank you sir...You understand this is all very sudden.It's intriguing...The payment offered is enticement enough, as is my desire to visit the metropolis.As luck would have it, my wife and children are traveling. I will write her of our plans.No need. My return will coincide with my family's.It's the national mood. There's too much grief to make room for frivolity.You have described it, yes.You present a flattering representation. As my family will be traveling back shortly, perhaps I might commit only to one trial engagement.Not necessary.That...it's far more than my wages amount to.....So...so sorry...I am Solomon Northup. I am a free man; a resident of Saratoga, New York. The residence also of my wife and children who are equally free. I have papers. You have no right whatsoever to detain me--And I promise you - I promise - upon my liberation I will have satisfaction for this wrong....I...I insist... Burch regrets hearing this. Not from sympathy, but rather because he's nearly too tired to go back to beating Solomon. Yet, as if returning to work, Burch returns to pummeling Solomon. Burch punctuates the blows...No... Burch goes back to whipping and whipping, and whipping...Help me! Someone help me! If anyone at all hears him, they do not respond. Solomon continues his plaintive cry for assistance.Quiet, please. Randall is becoming nearly inconsolable.Your mother will come, I swear she will, but you must be silent. Please. Be silent! On the seeming strength of Solomon's promise, Randall goes silent. Solomon looks to Radburn, who just throws water on the soapy men....Thank you...No! It was from my wife.This can't stand. It is a crime. I believe now someone lay in wait for me. My drink was altered... We are free men. They have...they have no right to hold us. Solomon waits for a response from the others. They give none.We need a sympathetic ear. If we have an opportunity to explain ourThe two men I journeyed with. I'm certain they're making inquires at this very moment.They were not kidnappers. They were artists. Fellow performers.The crew is fairly small. If it were well planned, I believe they could be strong armed.Days ago I was with my family, in my home. Now you tell me all is lost. \"Tell no one who I really am\" if I want to survive. I don't want to survive, I want to live.My name is not Platt. My name is-- Freeman strikes Solomon hard across the face.Can you play a reel?If I may...? Cape looks to Freeman:But he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? Is not he that sitteth at meat? But I am among you as he that serveth. A white customer - WINSLOW - irate at the sight and sound of slaves reading Scripture, crosses over. He grabs the Bible.The creek is plenty deep enough to sail, even with a boat full of load. The distance from the WORK AREA to the point on the latter bayou is several miles by water fewer than land. It occurs to me that the expense of the transportation would be materiallyIf we use the waterway.I reckon them at more than twelve feet at their most narrow. Wide enough for a tub to traverse. A team of niggers can clear it out.I labored repairing the Champlain canal, on the section over which William Van Nortwick was superintendent. With my earnings I hired several efficient hands to assist me, and I entered into contracts for the transportation of large rafts of timber from Lake Champlain to Troy.My great thanks, Master Ford.Eliza. Eliza, stop! Solomon goes to her, grabs Eliza. She does not stop. As if to force the misery from her, Solomon SHAKES ELIZAStop it! Stop!You let yourself be overcome by sorrow. You will drown in it....They are as my flesh...Master Ford is a decent man.Under the circumstances--No...I survive. I will not fall into despair. Woeful and crushed; melancholy is the yolk I see most. I will offer up my talents to Master Ford. I will keep myself hearty until freedom is opportune.protesting my freedom. Do notSir, have I done something wrong?Sir.Yes, sir.They are, sir.As smooth to the touch as a yearling's coat.Only a matter of perspective, sir. From where you stand you may see differently. But the hands are not mistaken. I ask only that you employ all your senses before rendering judgement. What's Tibeats to do when faced with fact? All he can do is spew invectives.I'll do as ordered, sir.Yes, sir.Yes, master. I am about it. I have begun on the other side of the house. Tibeats walks around to look over Solomon's work. He is picayune, as if purposefully looking for fault.And so I did; and Chapin said he would get another size for you, if you wanted them when he came back from the field. Tibeats walks to the keg and kicks it. Moving toward Solomon \"with a great passion:\"I did as instructed. If there's something wrong, then its wrong with your instructions.I will not. With \"concentrated vengeance,\" Tibeats springs for Solomon, seizing him by the throat with one hand andMaster Tibeats wants to whip me for using the nails you gave me.Master Ford, you must know; I am not a slave.Before I came to you I was a freeman.Yes, Mistress.I can, ma'am. Handing Solomon a sheet of paper.I will, Mistress. Solomon looks at the list. In a careless moment, Solomon reads quietly from it. He catches himself, but not before the Mistress notes his action. With highI have told you.Washington.Master name of Freeman.I suppose so.A word here or there, but I have no understanding of the written text.(almost tripping overNo, ma'am. No trouble.Good morning, Master Shaw. I've been sent by Master to retrieve Patsey. May I approach?Excuse me, Mistress Shaw.My apologies. Patsey, Master wishes you to return.Understood. But the Master sent me running to fetch you, and said no time should be wasted.Thank you, Mistress, but I don't dare....I'd rather not say...As you are aware, Master Epps can be a man of a hard countenance. There are times when it is impossible to account for his logic. You know he has ill feelings toward your husband.Master Epps has somehow come to believe, as incorrectly as it may be, that Master Shaw is... That he is something of a lothario and an unprincipled man. A misguided belief born out of their mutual competition as planters, no doubt.I'm certain Patsey's well being is Master Epps's only concern.I meant no disrespect.I meant no disrespect to you, Mistress.Do not look in his direction. Continue on. Epps does not care to be ignored. He lifts himself and moves toward the pair in a rage.Found her, Master, and brought her back just as instructed.No words were spoken. None of consequence.I cannot speak of what did not occur. Epps grabs Solomon.A misunderstanding is all. It began when I was sent to retrieve Patsey from where she'd taken sabbatical at Master Shaw's. Upon returning, Master Epps believed Patsey and me to be in conversation when we were not. I tried to explain, but it lead to all this.I am.Return it!For what cause?No.No! I will do no such thing. The...the gory detail with whichIt is melancholia, nothing more. How does such despair even come to you?There are others. Beg them.Why? Why would you consign me to damnation with such an un-Godly request?...Sir...No, sir, I have not.Niggers are hired to work, not to read and write. Turner gives that a bit of consideration as he gives Solomon a wary looking over.I do.Sir.C'mere. C'mon, boy.They acted out of desperation....No...You know this to be so?Who are you?What is your name?What are your circumstances?Yes.There are some whose tracks the hounds will refuse to follow.This is all my allowance for thePlatt.I was. I am. Solomon exposes his wrist, displays his tattoo as heI remain free in my heart.I will not.I have a plan. I have a letter.I risk discovery to take more.I have my letter.All that remains is to contrive measures by which the letter can safely be deposited in the post office. When Celeste speaks she is quite melancholy.Is it more food you need?None will come after you in the swamps.The solitude plays tricks. It's your impression, nothing more. If you go back to your master you could face the same.Better the loneliness. You have been free most of the summer. Return now and your master will make example of you.Go north. Make your way by night...You won't be caught. The dogs won't track you. You are...you are unique. Celeste...To return is to die!Celeste... Celeste! Solomon continues after Celeste, wading deeper into the dark night and murky waters.Celeste, I will guide you north! Wait, and I will take you. Celeste is too nimble. She outpaces Solomon, continues on and disappears into the night.Let me take you! Let me go with you! Solomon runs on, then splashes to a stop. He stumbles around disoriented, calling into the blackness:Celeste... Nothing. No answer. Not a human one. There are sounds and echoes - some in the distance, some perhaps moving closer - which, moment by moment, become more and more frightening. Soon, Solomon realizes he is in quite literally over his head; the water first chest deep, then neck deep. With no way to orient himself, no means to guide him in the dark, Solomon's reserve begins to crumble. He thrashes in the water trying to find his wayCeleste! Come to me, Celeste! In that moment Solomon is quite certain he is nearly done; that he will not find land, nor aid and that this is his final moment. His panic should be that tangible. It is either force of will, or survival instinct...or maybe just pure luck that carries Solomon on until he reaches first muddy ground, then firm footing. Hauling himself onto the swamps edge, Solomon finally collapses in a drenched, worn heap. His life spared, but Celeste never to be seen again.I did not, sir.How did you arrive at such a place, if I may ask?Where is your place of birth?...I cannot say that I have.Why did you leave it?The proceeds of my fiddling performances. A few picayunes, but all I have in the world. I promise them to you if you will do me the favor I require. But I beg you not to expose me if you cannot grant the request.First, your word, sir.It is a simple enough request. I ask only that you deposit a letter in the Marksville post office. And that you keep the action an inviolable secret forever. The details of the letter are of no consequence. Even at that, there would be an imposition of much pain and suffering were it known I was the author. A patron is what I require, sir....It is not yet written. I will have it in a day. Two at most, my skill with composition as poor as it is. Armsby considers the request.In two days. ...Thank you. Solomon exits.All I have to say, master, is all that need be said. There is no truth in it.How could I write a letter without ink or paper? There is nobody I want to write to 'cause I hain't got no friends living as I know of. That Armsby is a lying drunken fellow. You know this, just as you know that I am constant in truth. Now, master, I can see what that Armsby is after, plain enough. Didn't he want you to hire him for an overseer? A beat.That's it. He wants to make you believe we're all going to run away and then he thinks you'll hire an overseer to watch us. He believes you are soft soap. He's given to such talk. I believe he's just made this story out of whole cloth, 'cause he wants to get a situation. It's all a lie, master, you may depend on't. It's all a lie. For a tense moment we are unsure which way Epps'll go. Increasingly it become apparent that, shallow minded and equally soused, Solomon has been able to fold Epps's thoughts. In a low curse that clearly states his ill intentions.Thou devil! Sooner or later, somewhere in the course of eternal justice thou shalt answer for this sin! Though Epps fronts rage, there should be underlying anguish for what he has done to his beloved Pats.Master Bass, I want to ask you what part of the country you came from?Oh, I know where Canada is. I have been there myself.Montreal and Kingston and Queenston and a great many places. And I have been in York state, too. Buffalo and Rochester and Albany, and can tell you the names of the villages on the Erie canal and the Champlain canal. Bass gives Solomon a long and curious stare.Master Bass, if justice had been done I never would have been here.I am afraid to tell you, though I don't believe you would tell Master Epps if I should.Just nearly...just passed eleven.Do you believe, sir, in justice as you have said?That slavery is an evil that should befall none?If you truly do, I would ask...I would beg that you write my friends in the north, acquainting them with my situation and beseeching them to forward free papers, or take such steps as they might consider proper to secure my release. Bass looks at Solomon, holding his gaze for more than a prolonged beat.My daughter Margaret is possibly now 19 and my son Alonzo, 16. I miss them so. It would be an unspeakable happiness to clasp my wife and my family again. Bass hands Solomon an end of a long plank of wood and looks over his shoulder, as if to camouflage the conversation by work. They both lift it toward the floorboards. Finally Bass speaks.You are certain? Bass takes a marker from Solomon and slides it into the earth.Five months. On top of these years. No cause remains.Mr. Bass...Go home knowing you have tried. The weight of defeat should hang very heavily with both men. Nothing more to do, nothing more to say BASS TAKES...Sir... The Sheriff crosses to him.Yes, sir. Pointing off to the distance.Mr. Parker...?Mr. Parker? As he does, Epps makes his way over.Solomon Northup is my name.I have a wife and two children.Margaret and Alonzo.Anne Hampton. I am who I say. Solomon pushes past the sheriff. As Solomon moves toward Parker, his pace quickens with each step until hisI apologize for my appearance. I have had a difficult time of things these past many years. Solomon looks among his family; trying to recall them as much as they look to see familiarity within him. To hisAlonzo... Margaret, yes? You do not recognize me, do you? Doyou...do you even remember the last time we saw each other? I put you on a carriage with your mother... Margaret, tearing, hugs her father. Solomon almost breaks, but he keeps himself together. Looking to theAnd who is this?Husband?We have much acquainting to do. Margaret rises, she presents her bundle to her father....Solomon... The fact his grandson carries his name, is overwhelming. Solomon breaks down. Emotionally, physically... But ANNE IS THERE TO CATCH HIM.

God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine. Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.

A gift from his Mistress.I encourage it. As a Christian I can do no less.Pay him no mind. The word of God applies to all. In that you may take comfort.My thanks to you, and it is the least of it. My hope is that it brings us both much joy over the years. Following the statement, Solomon's not sure how to react. He remains grateful, but the thought of \"over the years\" is just a reminder of the altered state in which he now finds himself.At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. The phrase seems to trigger Eliza's tears. She begins to sob uncontrollably. Mrs. Ford turns to Rachel in a hushed whisper-But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. Woe untothe world because of offences! For it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!He's a good carpenter and quick- witted.You won't find a nigger more humble.Not your concern, Platt. I say with much...shame I have compiled debts. I have long preached austerity, but find myself hypocritical in that regard. You'll be in the ownership of Mr. Tibeats. You are his now. Serve him as you'd serve me.And your faithfulness will not be forgotten.Pride and want have been my sin. Loss of you is but one of my punishments.Platt... My poor Platt. Ford produces a blade and cuts Solomon loose. Solomon attempts to carry himself, but he cannot. He falls to the ground and passes out.I believe Tibeats is skulkin' about the premises somewhere. He wants you dead, and he will attempt to have you so. It's no longer safe for you here. And I don't believe you will remain passive if Tibeats attacks. I have transferred my debt to Edwin Epps. He will take charge of you.I cannot hear that.I am trying to save your life! And...I have a debt to be mindful of. That, now, is to Edwin Epps. He is a hard man.

Tha's real good.How much can even an average nigger pick a day?This nigger ain't even average. Epps pulls Solomon aside.Five hundred twelve. Yah men folk got no shame lettin' Patsey out pick yah? The day ain't yet come she swung lower than five hundred pounds. Queen of the fields, she is.I ain't done, Treach. Ain't I owed a minute to luxuriate on the work Patsey done?Damned Queen. Born and bred to the field. A nigger among niggers, and God give 'er to me. A lesson in the rewards of righteous livin'. All be observant ta that. All!Hit one forty five yesterday. Pull her out.How much he pick yesterday?Get up! Get up, we dance tonight! We will not waste the evenin' with yer laziness. Get up.Where's yah merriment? Move yer feet. As the slaves twirl about Epps keeps an attentive eye on Patsey. It should be quite clear that his primary motivation for holding dances is so that he may view Patsey twirl about the floor. This fact is not lost on Mistress Epps. A few moments of Epps's lust on display is all that the Mistress can bear. Jealousy mounting, she snatches up a CARAFE. With all her might she throws it at Patsey. It hits Patsey square in the face. TOO THICK TO SHATTER, IT LEAVES HER BLOODY AND WRITHING ON THE FLOOR. The dancing, the music stop. The slaves, however, react as though it is not the first time they've seen as much from the Mistress. Mistress Epps, screaming like a hellion:C'mon, now. Wha's this?You're talkin' foolish. Sell little Pats? She pick with more vigor than any other nigger! Choose another ta go.I will not!Back to that hog's trough where I found you? Oh, the idleness of that yarn washes over me. Do not set yourself up against Patsey, my dear. That's a wager on which you will not profit. Calm yerself. And settle for my affection, 'cause my affection you got. Or, go. 'Cause I will rid myself of yah well before I do away with her! Mistress Epps stands irate, lost in fury and unable to even think of what to do. Eventually, optionless, she storms away. For a few beats there is only the sound of Patsey sobbing.That damned woman! I won't have my mood spoiled. I will not. Dance! Epps sends the whip in Solomon's direction. Solomon responds by playing. Treach literally drags the prone Patsey from the floor, blood still spilling from her face. The slaves, as ordered, return to dancing.Pats...! Patsey!Patsey...! Solomon moves between Epps and Patsey, cutting Epps off as Patsey continues on. Playing up his \"ignorance\" ofWhat'd you jus now tell her? What'd you say to Pats?Lie! Damned liar! Saw you talkin' with 'er. Tell me!I'll cut your black throat. Solomon pulls away from Epps, RIPPING HIS SHIRT IN THE PROCESS. Epps gives chase. Solomon begins to run around the large pig sty, easily keeping his distance. Epps, however is undeterred. He moves after Solomon as speedily as he can, which isn't very speedily at all. And quickly he tires. Epps is forced to bend over and suck air. Solomon maintains his distance, barely breathing hard. His breath returned to him, Epps starts up the chase again. Solomon runs on out of reach. Shortly, Epps again stops, gets his breath... And now in what should be quite comical, Epps again runs after Solomon. Again, Epps's vigor leaves him before he can even get close to the slave. Dropping down to the dirt, in a show of regret and piety:Platt... Platt, liquor filled me. I admit that it did, and I done over reacted. It's the Lord's day. Ain't nothin' Christian in us carryin' on like this. Help me ta my feet, and let us both pray to the Lord for forgiveness. Epps extends a hand to Solomon. Cautiously, Solomon moves close, but not too close. As Solomon draws within striking distance, Epps lunges for him. He chases Solomon on until he is again out of breath and once more drops down. And again offering a treaty:I'm all done in, Platt. I have met my limitations, and I ain't equal to 'em. I concede to yah, but in the name of valor, help yer master to his feet. Solomon cautiously moves closer to help. Again he is attacked by Epps - this time by knife. Sort of. Epps is too drunk and tired to fully open the folding blade - and chased far around the field by Epps. ALL OF THEHold a moment...Wha's...wha's he been tellin' yah?And he would know what of anythin'? I ain't even spoken with him today. Platt, yah lyin' nigger, have I? Have I? Discretion being the better part and all, Solomon remains silent.There; there's all the truth he got. Damned nigger. Damn yah. Epps pushes his way past the Mistress.Seen nothin' but her turn away.Whatever it was, it passed.It is a plague.A plague! It's damn Biblical. Two season God done sent a plague to smite me. I am near ruination. Why, Treach? What I done that God hate me so? Do I not preach His word?I don't care nothin' fer the damn Bayou. I'm sufferin'. Epps looks among his slaves at work, his enmity growing.It's that Godless lot. They brought this on me. I bring 'emGod's word, and heathens they are, they brung me God's scorn. Crazed, Epps runs into the field, taking himself from slave to slave delivering a whipping to all he can lay his hands on.Damn you! Damn you all! Damn you!Yer Judge Turner's for the season. More if need be, until my crop return. Yah'll bring no disrespect to me, and yah'll bring no biblical plagues to him. Be decent, ere mark my words, I will deliver an ungodly whippin'.A joyous day. A joyous day. Dark times is behind us. Clean livin' 'n prayer done lifted the plague. Indicating to the cotton:As thick 'n white as New England snow. 'N now my niggers is returned to me.Wiley...?Bob?Patsey?Tha's a girl. Don't never let me down. Platt?Armsby?A good days labor would average two hundred pounds.I'm sure in time y'll develope as a picker, but it takes effort, boy. Put some damn effort into it.Take 'em out. Get to whippin'. No force is needed. The slaves understand the situation. They follow Treach out of the Gin house.Get up. Solomon does. Epps heads back out into the dark. He says nothing, but his directive is clear: Follow me.Well, boy. I understand I've got a larned nigger that writesletters and tries to get white fellows to mail 'em. Solomon, hardly missing a beat, plays this off.Well, Armsby tol' me today the devil was among my niggers. That I had one that needed close watchin' or he would run away. When I axed him why, he said you come over to him and waked him up in the middle of the night and wanted him to carry a letter to Marksville. What have yah got to say to that?You say.I'm damned. I'll be god... Were he not free and white, Platt. Were he not free and white. Epps heads off. Solomon is left to exhale a deep breath.Take it. You look unsettled.No shame in taking respite from the heat; drink, shade. It's ungodly for travelers. Hearty, or otherwise.I meant no joke.Then share what's funny. Or what ills you.Something rubs you wrongly. Before I take further offense, I offer you the opportunity to speak on it.\"The condition of my...\" What in the hell are you--They ain't hired help. They're my slaves.I say it as fact.What right? I bought 'em. I paid for 'em.Ha!That ain't a supposable case.Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yah compare me to a nigger, Bass? Yah might as well ask what the difference is between a white man and a baboon. Now, I seen one of them critters in Orleans that knowed just as much as any nigger I got. Yah'd call them fellers citizens, I s'pose?Ahhh!You betray yourself a foreigner!You like to hear yourself talk, Bass, better than any man I know of. Yah'd argue that black was white, or white black if anybody would contradict you. A fine supposition if yah lived among Yankees in New England. But yah don't.Patsey... Patsey! A drunk Epps asks of the slaves:Where is she? Where is Patsey? No one answers.Talk, Damn you!The hell you don't! You know where she is! She run off, ain't she? She's escaped, and you miserable black dogs stand likethe deef and dumb. Speak! Speak! Not a word spoken.My best cotton picking nigger! My best. A beat.I'd give yah all up for her. Where she gone? The slaves say nothing. There is nothing for them to say. They don't know where she is. Eventually Epps drops into true sorrow.She gone... My Pats gone.Run off. Run off, did you?You miserable wench! Where you been?Lies to your misdeeds!Bring the Lord into yer deceptions? Yah Godless... Shaw's. Comin' from Shaw's plantation weren't yah?Yah took yerself ta pleasure Shaw. Yah gave baser passion to that unblushin' libertine! Solomon tries to intervene:Now yah speak? Now that yah want to add to 'er lies yah find yer tongue. Epps goes to strike Solomon, but Patsey pulls his arm back.Yah admit it.You lie...You lie!I'll learn you to go to Shaw's. Treach, go get some line.Strip her. Strike her bare 'n lash her to the post. Mistress Epps has now come from the Great House. She gazes on the scene with an air of heartless satisfaction. Now tied to the post, Epps stands behind Patsey with his whip.Yah done this to yerself, Pats! Epps hoists the whip to strike, holds it high...but no matter his rage, Epps cannot bring himself to deliver the blow. He looks to Mistress Epps who now stands gloating and spurring him on.Beat her. Solomon doesn't move. Epps shoves the whip into his hand.Give her the whip. Give it all to her! Patsey, begging to Solomon:Strike her, or yah'll get the same!Yah will strike her. Yah will strike her until her flesh is rent and meat and blood flow equal, or I will kill every nigger in my sight! Solomon can't strike a blow, even if it means his life. But from the ground, from Patsey:Until I say no more! I ain't said nothing! Solomon strikes another ten to fifteen times. By now, as promised, Patsey's back has been reduced to LITTLE MOREStrike her! Strike her! Solomon will not. Epps takes up the whip and whips Patsey with \"ten fold\" greater force than he had. The painfully loud and angry curses of Epps load the air. Patsey by now is terribly lacerated, literally flayed. The lash wet with blood which flowed down her sides and dropped upon the ground. At length Patsey ceases struggling. Her head sinks listlessly on the ground.No sin! There is no sin! A man does how he pleases with his property. At the moment, Platt, I am of great pleasure. You be goddamn careful I don't come to wantin' to lightenin' my mood no further. By contrast to this horror, the field of cotton smiles in the warm sunlight. The birds chirp merrily amidst the foliage of the tress. Peace and happiness seems to reign everywhere. Everywhere else. Epps leaves Patsey to herself. He says not a word to the Mistress as he passes. The Mistress herself heads back into the house. Solomon unties Patsey, lifts her and takes her to the cabin.Sheriff...What's all this?My nigger, my business.Nah... You will unhand 'em. Platt is my nigger!You say...You say! You come here, unfamiliar to me, and make claims.To hell with that! My nigger, and I'll fight you for 'em!You think this is the last you'll see of me, boy? It ain't.Saddle my horse! And bring her up here. Epps walks back into the plantation. The trio starts for the carriage.

inadvertent. Sensing perhaps Bass's laughter might be at his expense, Epps presses.I'm here to complete the work at hand. As requested, and as paid.You ask plainly, I will tell you plainly. What I find amusing: You worry about my well being in the heat but, quite frankly, the condition of your laborers--It is horrid. It's all wrong. All wrong, sir.You say that with pride.If the conversation concerns what is factual and what is not; there's no justice nor righteousness in slavery. I wouldn't own a slave if I was rich as Croesus, which I am not, as is perfectly well understood. More particularly among my creditors. There's another humbug: the credit system. Humbug, sir. No credit, no debt. Credit leads a man into temptation. Cash down is the only thing that will deliver him fromevil. But this question of slavery; what right have you to your niggers when you come down to the point?Of course you did. The law says you have the right to hold a nigger, but begging the law's pardon...it lies. Is everything right because the law allows it? Suppose they'd pass a law taking away your liberty and making you a slave?Suppose.Because the law states that your liberties are undeniable? Because society deems it so? Laws change. Social systems crumble. Universal truths are constant. It is a fact, it is a plain fact that what is true and right is true and right for all. White and black alike.Look here; you can't laugh me down in that way. These niggers are human beings. If they are allowed to scale no higher than brute animals, you and men like you will have to answer for it. There's anA fearful ill, resting on thisThat will not go unpunished forever. There will be a reckoning yet.No part of this land. I was born in Canada. Now guess where that is.Have you?Well traveled for a slave. How came you here?How's this? Tell me all about it.Every word you speak is a profound secret.How many years all told?Your story is...it is amazing, and in no good way.I do.I believe so.I have always forgone relationships and family. I did once have a sweetheart who I loved deeply. Bass points to a measuring tool, which Solomon immediately hands over.But that was a long, long time ago. I've been traveling this country for the best part of twenty years. My freedom is everything. The fact that I can walk out of here tomorrow gives me most pleasure. I see the aching in your eyes, the pain of not being attached to your loved ones. My life doesn't mean much to anyone, but it seems your life means a lot to a lot of people. What you have just said to me scares me, and I must say, sir, I am afraid. Not just for you, but for me. They continue working, fixing the floorboards in unison. Solomon, slightly confused.I will write your letter sir, for if I could bring freedom to you, it will be more than a pleasure. It will be a duty. Now, would you be so kind as to pass me those nails, sir. We pull back to reveal the two men dwarfed by the unfinished structure. They continue to work, as if the conversation had never occurred.And bring those markers! Solomon gathers a clutch of markers in his hands and approaches Bass.No letter yet.I have inquired thoroughly. More than is safe for either of us. Bass takes another and pokes it into the ground, improvising a pathway towards the gazebo.Solomon...I have a job or two on hand which will be completed shortly... The work here has grown sparse.You must know, wherever I am I will press your cause.If there is any chance...I will continue to write your", "clean_line": "humor inadvertent sensing bass laughter expense epps presses complete work hand requested paid ask plainly tell plainly amusing worry heat frankly condition laborers horrid wrong wrong sir pride conversation concerns factual justice righteousness slavery wouldn slave rich croesus perfectly understood particularly creditors humbug credit humbug sir credit debt credit leads man temptation cash thing deliver fromevil question slavery right niggers come point course law says right hold nigger begging law pardon lies right law allows suppose pass law taking away liberty making slave suppose law states liberties undeniable society deems laws change social systems crumble universal truths constant fact plain fact true right true right white black alike look laugh way niggers human beings allowed scale higher brute animals men like answer ana fearful ill resting thisthat unpunished forever reckoning land born canada guess traveled slave came tell word speak profound secret years told story amazing good way believe forgone relationships family sweetheart loved deeply bass points measuring tool solomon immediately hands long long time ago ve traveling country best years freedom fact walk tomorrow gives pleasure aching eyes pain attached loved ones life mean life means lot lot people said scares sir afraid continue working fixing floorboards unison solomon slightly confused write letter sir bring freedom pleasure duty kind pass nails sir pull reveal men dwarfed unfinished structure continue work conversation occurred bring markers solomon gathers clutch markers hands approaches bass letter inquired thoroughly safe bass takes pokes ground improvising pathway gazebo solomon job hand completed shortly work grown sparse know press cause chance continue write"}}}
