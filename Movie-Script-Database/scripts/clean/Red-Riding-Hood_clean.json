{"Red-Riding-Hood": {"ISABELLE": {"raw_line": "I can't. It's the fifth commandment. Thou shalt not kill. Lucie rolls her eyes. Isabelle crouches, letting the spider crawl off her hand. She watches it skitter away, then calls to Suzette, feigning nonchalance:I'm going to take Father some water.I can do it myself. The Carpenter smiles. Of course she can.Mother thought you might be thirsty.You should know better than that.I think my sister's starting to suspect something.I don't care. I wish she would tell him. I want everyone to know. Besides, my father likes you.What's going on?Was it the Wolf?I know. You say that every month.I'd better go.Don't get used to this. I start my sewing lessons next week.I'll manage somehow. Pride is a cardinal sin, by the way.Yes, Mother. Suzette hands her the basket with a proud look.I know. THREE GIRLS approach: ROXANNE , PRUDENCE , and ROSEMARIA . A playful PUPPY tags along. Prudence and Rosemaria look tired, but Roxanne greets Isabelle with a big smile.You look happy.Oh, no! Which one?What's the matter, Rosemaria? Having trouble walking? Prudence laughs. Roxanne frowns, disapproving. Rosemaria shoots Isabelle a dirty look.Yes, ma'am. Grandmother eyes her a moment longer, then breaks into a smile and surreptitiously hands her a bright red apple.She works with the women.I don't know how to yet.Like a child. Grandmother gives her a smile, then continues.What about? Peter just looks at her for a beat. Isabelle turns and sees that the other girls have stopped to watch. Isabelle shoots them a look. The girls take the hint and leave. When they've gone, Peter walks up to Isabelle.Telling you what?Henri Smith? Is this a joke?Who told you this?So Henri Smith is in the family's interest and Peter is not?But what? He's poor? He's an orphan?Why? Because they hadn't lived here since Noah built the ark?Hello, Henri.Yes. My parents are very pleased.It's a very generous arrangement.I'm not sure. We've never really talked that much.What for?Not until the spring festival. That's months away. A lot can happen in a few months. Henri seems disappointed. She sees this and reconsiders.All right. What would you like to talk about?Well, I'm glad we had this conversation. Isabelle abruptly turns and walks away, leaving Henri surprised and a little hurt. She passes Peter, her eyes averted. He glances back at her as she and walks away...What happened?Didn't you want to marry your sweetheart?You've never wished you could have married that other boy?I don't care what my parents want. They don't own me. I love you.It does to me. Doesn't it matter to you?You sound like my mother.I don't believe you.I don't believe you! He doesn't look back. She watches him go, heartbroken.Yes, Father. Isabelle reluctantly turns and walks away. The girls follow her. Roxanne gives Lucie a concerned look.Lucie is not in love with my fianc\u00c3\u00a9e.As if she would really tell you something like that.Come on. We're going to be late. She turns away. Rosemaria gives her a smug look.What are you doing?You can't go that way. You have to stay on the path.People still die.You were right. About Peter. I was being childish.The family gains the same no matter which one of us marries him. And I don't love Henri. Lucie does. Lucie looks up, surprised to be dragged into this.She's right. It's not fair. I will gladly trade places with her. A beat. Then, without looking up, Lucie whispers:I'm sorry... I...I think I'd like that.What is it?Nobody. I just --It was folded when they found her. Her clothes, too. Did you notice that?She was so unhappy. Suzette turns, her eyes narrowing dangerously.Maybe she went into the woods on purpose. Maybe she wanted to die. Suddenly: Suzette slaps her across the face. Hard.I'm sorry. I just need to talk to someone. Can I come in? Peter balks. Just then, a figure appears. Isabelle can't believe her eyes... It's Rosemaria. She's standing behind Peter, but it's clear that she's naked.I hate the cold. Why can't we have lessons in the summer?I heard your father wounded the beast. He was a brave man.You told me you had a sweetheart before you were married. It was Henri's father, wasn't it?Lucie was in love with Henri. She could have married him. Couldn't she have?But you gained the same no matter which one of us married him. So why did it have to be me?No. You say it. Suzette's eyes well up. Then:Am I? Do you even know?Does he know?I don't know what to do. She wants me to pretend like I don't know. How am I supposed to go on living in that house?I'm going to the festival.Someone has to look after him.Please, don't do this -- Henri brushes her aside, but too hard and she stumbles. Peter instantly grabs hold of Henri's wrist. HenriPeter! Wait!I just want to make sure you're all right. Peter stops. He whirls on Isabelle, incredulous.You're bleeding.You think I want to feel like this? You think I enjoy feeling like a fool every day because I can't stop loving you? Peter's bravado falters. He can't completely hide what her words do to him. She looks up at him, realizing...Why are you with Rosemaria? You hate Rosemaria.You're a terrible liar. Isabelle takes a step closer and presses the palm of her hand against his chest. A beat.There. You're heart is starting to beat faster. And the little black circles in the middle of your eyes still get bigger when I touch you. She gazes up at him. He tries not to look in her eyes, but can't stop himself.You can tell me you don't love me, but I know what you're really feeling. I can feel it with my hand and see it with my eyes. Peter hesitates, then covers her hand with his own.How could you think that?That means less to me now than ever. We can leave here. We can go someplace where we'll both be strangers.The only life I want is with you.I know you are. I just don't care. She kisses him on the mouth, then quickly steps back, as if she did it before she could change her mind. Then he takes her in his arms and they kiss, long and hard.I don't want to wait.It's not soon enough. She pulls him to her and kisses him.This feels like a dream. I'm afraid if I leave you I might wake up. He kisses her and holds her tight. Neither of them notice Henri, angrily watching from the shadows...I've never seen it full before... Suddenly -- the CHURCH BELLS start to ring. Everyone falls silent. Confused looks all around. Then, somewhere in the dark... ... a WOLF HOWLS. The Villagers gasp. A WOMAN screams. People start to panic. Claude is knocked down.You have to stop it. He can't hear you and you are going to get us killed. Do you understand me? Roxanne nods, crying. Isabelle helps her up -- and finds herself face-to-face with the Wolf. Roxanne screams. They run back the way they came, turn another corner --Come on! Isabelle climbs the wall, but Roxanne's not going to make it. Isabelle jumps down to help her... ... just as the Wolf's shadow falls over the alley. The girls watch helplessly as the Wolf slowly walks toward them, SNARLING and glaring at them with its strange, near- human eyes. Then, inexplicably... the Wolf speaks.How do you know me? Who are you?What big eyes you have...Are you going to kill us?Then what do you want?I don't know who you are, but we are not the same. I would rather die than go with you.Is Peter here?What about Claude? Or my parents?Would you look for them? Please? Prudence nods and rushes off. Roxanne slumps in a corner, a dazed look on her face. A beat.It talked to us. A chill runs down Roxanne's spine. A long beat.Do not speak of this to anyone. Roxanne nods, but eyes Isabelle warily. Isabelle turns away, afraid and confused.Mother! Father!Is she dead?Peter... My mother's hurt. I can't leave. Not now.I don't have any choice. It's not just my mother. Something else happened last night.I can't tell you about it. I just have to stay. Peter nods, but his face darkens. A long, tense beat.I meant everything I said. This isn't what I wanted.Has Claude come home?He's run away before. He'll be all right. Roxanne nods, unconvinced. Prudence joins them. They all exchange a sad look.As clearly as I do you now. Grandmother fixes her with a serious look. A beat.Roxanne will never speak of it. She won't even talk to me about it. A long beat. Isabelle is working up her nerve. Then:I have to do what it wants. I have communed with an unholy beast. What does that make me if not cursed?But if it comes back for me and I don't go with it, then it will kill again. If I have the power to save even one life, aren't I compelled to do so?But how could it? Unless it really does know me? Isabelle and Grandmother exchange an anxious look...What about my family's debt?But who is it? An angry crowd has gathered. Solomon's Soldiers are all that's stopping it from turning into a lynch mob. Isabelle finds Roxanne in tears, trying to force her way through the crowd.What's wrong? What's happening? Roxanne doesn't answer, just plunges into the crowd. Isabelle goes in after her. Cesaire tries to stop her.It's not him! It can't be!It isn't him. It can't be. He was with us when the Wolf attacked. Solomon is taken aback. Surprised MURMURS in the room.He was there! He carried Claude away! He saved his life! Suddenly, all eyes are on the Carpenter. He shrinks back. He glances at his WIFE. She stares at him. Hard.Why wouldn't Father Solomon listen to me? Doesn't he care that Claude isn't guilty?But the Wolf is free. And the moon will be full in two days. The full weight of this hits home. Grandmother leans close, lowers her voice.I cannot leave.What is unthinkable is that I should be responsible for the deaths of everyone that I love. I'd rather spend a lifetime of misery than let that happen.But what if it was you it wanted? Would you go with it to save me? Or would you leave me to die? Grandmother doesn't have a fast answer for that. Suddenly, a HIDEOUS, INARTICULATE SCREAM echoes in the night. Isabelle and Grandmother exchange a grave look.No. I do not deny it. The crowd REACTS. Solomon quiets them with a look.It spoke, just as a man speaks.It told me... It promised to leave here and never return. But only if I leave with it. Roxanne gives her a stunned look. A heavy silence falls over the room. Even Solomon is surprised. Then:I don't know! I swear I don't know!That's impossible. Even Father Solomon doesn't have the first clue.What was it like in the old days?It's grown bold.But who would want to kill Lucie?My mother made me swear I would never speak of it.She was in love with Henri.What other explanation is there? Grandmother thinks. The pieces are fitting together...Has there been any word from my grandmother?What have you done to him?! Then: Isabelle's cell is opened. The Captain is holding iron manacles. Isabelle looks at them, horrified. The Soldiers clap her in irons. This is really happening...I love you so much. Tell Mama and Grandmother that I love them.Help... Father Auguste stops. The Villagers shift uncomfortably as her helpless voice calls out from inside the mask.Help me... Please... Help me... The Villagers start to leave, ashamed. Isabelle sees them going... and suddenly SCREAMS.I can hear you.I know. Will you tell her that I forgive her?You don't have to say anything.I think you'd better go now. Prudence looks up. The sun has almost set.Get away from me!Yes! Yes, please hurry! Solomon and his men watch as Henri uses a hammer and chisel to break open the stocks. BANG! BANG!Peter? Where is he --?I don't think so... Just then, they pass by the Reeve and a group of Villagers. The Villagers start to give chase, but Isabelle and Henri quickly leave them behind. Meanwhile, the Wolf is shortcutting through the village, racing after the cart. It comes to a sheep pen and smashes through it. It comes to a large barn and leaps onto its roof, then leaps off again -- -- and lands within striking distance of the cart. Henri drives the horse, but it's no use. The Wolf lunges, wrestling the horse to the ground. The horse cries out, its body twisting as it falls, sending the cart flying. Isabelle falls out and lands hard. Henri lies on his side, clutching his wrist. Isabelle pulls herself together and goes to him. She looks at his arm. It's visibly broken. She helps him to his feet -- -- just as the overturned cart is SMASHED apart. The Wolf bursts through it, breaking it to pieces. It glares at them with bloodthirsty eyes. Isabelle and Henri back away from it, but their escape is blocked -- the Villagers have caught up. They freeze at the sight of the Wolf, but stand their ground. Isabelle and Henri are trapped. The Reeve shouts:My place will never be with you.They're still good people.The Wolf is a man. It told me.Follow me. She takes his hand and leads him away.We need to come inside. Quickly.They're searching everywhere. We have to keep moving.Can we go out your back window? Roxanne nods. They hurry toward the window, but then:Henri, what are you doing?He's right. It's a coward at heart. Look at it. Why doesn't it attack? The Wolf SNARLS louder and takes a step toward her... but then the Merchant picks up a rock and throws it.It's past noon.Where's Father?Did they catch the Wolf?What about Grandmother? Suzette hesitates. Isabelle is suddenly concerned.I'm fine. You sent Henri to help me.Those people back there. I know they mean well, but they're just people. I didn't expect anything from them. I expected something from you.I'm going to see my Grandmother. She's sick. Please don't follow me. Isabelle starts walking again. Peter just stands there, watching her go. When she looks back, he's gone. She sighs, wiping tears from her eyes. She continues on... Then: FOOTSTEPS behind her again. She stops and looks back. Listens. Nothing. She keeps walking. But then she HEARS them again. Looks back. A dark figure follows her in the fog. She walks faster. She reaches the fork in the path. She pauses. The FOOTSTEPS are still behind her. She makes a decision. She breaks off a tree branch and backs toward the abandoned path, using the branch to sweep away her tracks in the snow. When she's far enough away from the main path, she throws the branch aside... ... and turns to face the abandoned path. It looks ominous. She gives it a wary look, then starts walking.Grandmother? Are you awake? She listens at the door. A long beat. Then:Mother sent some food. There are cakes and a pot of butter --Are you sure? You sound so weak.I came here to take care of you. Not the other way around.I've been worried about you. When you didn't come back yesterday, I was afraid...Yes. He saved my life. Isabelle takes another bite of soup, then pauses. She puts the bowl down and loosens her collar...I feel hot all of a sudden.What is this...?I don't think I want to.What is this? Where's Grandmother?You're not the Wolf. You can't be...Oh, dear God... You killed Lucie? You killed my sister?Yes, she was. In every way that matters, she was.Did Grandmother know?Yes, Father. Isabelle walks away. Cesaire watches her go...There must indeed be a God. For you are surely the Devil...Father...? He approaches her. Stands behind her and places his hand on her shoulder. Her skin crawls.You gave me two choices. She turns to face him. Looks up at him.But I have thought of a third. Suddenly -- CRUNCH! Isabelle drives something hard into Cesaire's jaw. He gasps, choking. He puts his had to his throat. Blood spills out through his fingers. CAMERA FINDS Grandmother's ball of yarn on the table. The knitting needles aren't sticking out of it anymore... They're sticking out of Cesaire's neck. He falls to his knees, gagging. Then he flops over dead. Eyes open. Isabelle gazes down at him. She looks like she might have just lost her mind. Then she sits on the floor, staring at his body... and screams. An eruption of rage, betrayal, and heartbreak. She screams.People should know what he was.Then I'll run away. I was ready to run away last night.No, you're not. You could never be like him.Yes, you can. We can still be together. My father lived here. My grandfather lived here.I don't want him ever found.No. We'll put the rocks inside him. Cut him open. I will sew the rocks inside him. Peter is taken aback. She's serious.Wait. She pulls back the burlap, revealing Cesaire's dead body. His belly is lumpy and misshapen, an ugly red line in his torso stitched together with black thread. The knitting needles still jut out of his jaw. Isabelle yanks them out, then pulls the burlap back over Cesaire's body. Peter gives her a questioning look.These belonged to my grandmother. The knitting needles are covered in blood. Peter takes out a rag and wipes the blood off for her. And as he does... something begins to shine through in the moonlight. Peter gives Isabelle a stunned look.I can live with it.Where will you go?I know.No, it isn't. You'll be in my dreams until the day I die. Peter turns and starts to walk away. But then he pauses.Yes, he is. Then Peter continues on until he vanishes in the fog.

Surprise and outrage ripple through the crowd. Isabelle and Roxanne exchange a shocked look.When a werewolf dies, it returns to its human form. If what you killed was a werewolf, then you would have a human head skewered atop that pole.My wife's name was P\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9lope. She was very pretty. And we were very happy. The Reeve tries to keep the confusion off his face. Attewater and Father Auguste exchange uncertain looks.We lived in a village not unlike this place. And not unlike this place, our village was plagued by a werewolf. I went out with some men to hunt it. It never even occurred to me that we might actually find it. But we did. He has everyone's attention now. All eyes are on him.It attacked me. All I saw were yellow teeth. I hacked at it with an axe and suddenly it was gone. There was blood on my axe. I had cut off one of its paws. I picked it up and put it in my sack.Her name was P\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9lope. She was very pretty. And we were very happy. Until the day I killed her. Solomon turns and gives Attewater a hard look.Your werewolf is still alive. And I promise you, it will kill again.I have examined the body of your blacksmith. There were bruises on his neck from where the beast held him in its jaws, squeezing his throat so that he could not scream.Only when it wanted you to. It used him as bait to lure you into the bit of theater it had prepared.That's what it wants you to think. It did kill your blacksmith. But the animal that you killed was not the werewolf.The blood was its own. The werewolf most likely wounded it earlier in the evening and left it in the cave for you to find and kill.That's correct. The werewolf does not live in the forest as you have rather na\u00c3\u00afvely assumed. It lives here in the village. Among you. There is a moment of shocked silence. Then mounting anger. Cesaire stands up and gestures to Henri.Have your festival. I will stay on here until then to ensure that you have the celebration you all so richly deserve. The Villagers seem appeased, especially the smug Merchant. A look passes between Solomon and his Captain. Isabelle catches it... and finds it unsettling.Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto. Sicut erat in principio, et nunc, et sempter, et in saecula saeculorum. Amen.Get to the church, you fools! The Wolf SNARLS up at him. Solomon gives a battle cry:We are safe here. God protects his own house and those within it. Isabelle finds Prudence.Are you bitten? Shivering, the Soldier nods. The Captain closes his eyes. Solomon stands and turns to Father Auguste.Step back. Confused, Father Auguste does as he's told. Then, before anyone can react, Solomon draws his sword and plunges it into the Soldier's heart. Everyone startles.The werewolf's bite is the same as death to a man. Stunned silence. Solomon turns to the Villagers.The dark days have returned to your village. Your homes are no longer safe. The Wolf will return. Again and again. And it will not stop until it has sucked the marrow from all your bones. Unless you stop it.cower in your beds and die like sheep? A long beat. The Villagers shiver and not just from the cold. But no one speaks. Solomon turns to Attewater.It appears my expertise is not as appreciated as I was led to believe. He turns to leave. Suddenly, Attewater steps forward.Silver. This is our most potent weapon. One blow will kill it.We must find it in its human form. Who among you do you suspect? Attewater and Father Auguste trade uncomfortable looks. Neither of them wants to speak up first.It has not survived this long by being obvious. The signs will be subtle. Insomnia. Restlessness. Strange behavior. Strange smells. Well, none of them smell good, but we must start somewhere.Perhaps. Unless it planted the hair to make us think that.Not necessarily. It may be the child or grandchild of the werewolf that first struck here.It is. But it effects men and women differently. A man can inherit the curse. Or he can be turned simply by being bitten. Solomon turns toward the fire and stares into it.But women are immune to the werewolf's bite. In order for a woman to be turned, she must inherit the curse. But even then it will lie dormant unless she eats human flesh. Only then will the bite of a male werewolf change her. Only then can she become a werewolf and capable of passing the curse on to her own children.Of course. It could be any one of you. Attewater and Father Auguste exchange a wary look.You say you saw the accused perform magic?So it was common knowledge that the accused was a conjurer?Are you aware that it is the custom of witches and devil worshippers to hold their black sabbaths in cemeteries?And do you know of their practice of dancing with invisible devils during these rituals?Is there one here today who you have seen dancing in your cemetery?So you consider the black mass to be a jest? There are suspicious WHISPERS among the Villagers. Father Auguste eyes them nervously. A beat.Then point him out. Father Auguste reluctantly points to Claude.What is your relationship to the accused?And where is his father?Well, what is his name? She pauses. The crowd eyes her, disapproving. A beat.You say a man whose name you cannot recall is the father of your child? What can you tell us about him?Almost as if it were a dream? Certain devils called incubi can collect human semen and then transfer it to women as they sleep. A woman who unwittingly conceives in this manner would not be a whore. She would be blameless in the eyes of God.You remember almost nothing of the man who impregnated you. Is it not possible that there was no man? That the accused is not the product of your own sin, but the foul offspring of a werewolf whose semen was placed in you by an incubus while you slept?We have proven here today that behind this veil of feigned idiocy is the fiend that has plagued your village. However, in order for the sentence of death to be carried out, the Church requires either a confession or the testimony of a witness who has seen the accused in his transformed state. Since the accused has refused to confess, this court calls upon its final witness. Isabelle Ordeville. Isabelle is stunned. All eyes turn toward her.On the night of the last full moon, you were attacked by the Wolf. You looked it in the eye. And the one thing a werewolf can never change is its eyes.Look into his eyes, my child. Do you see the beast in them? Isabelle gives Claude a pitying look. Solomon watches, expectant. Then:Is this true? Is there another here who can speak to this?Very well. Since no one here can bear witness, we must extort a confession. This court shall reconvene tomorrow at dawn. Solomon leaves. Claude is dragged out of the room by Soldiers. Isabelle gives Grandmother a helpless look.Enough of this. Let's eat. He gestures to the Scribe, who hands Attewater a document.A statement declaring that you heard the boy confess. All it requires is your signature. Or your mark, if you cannot write.Very well. Listen more carefully this time. He gestures for the Soldiers to throw more wood on the fire. The FLAMES leap higher. Attewater goes pale. All he hears are screams. Solomon stands next to the bull. The flames gleam off the brass, casting him in hellfire.Listen to how he sings of his love of Satan. How he despairs that he will never again copulate with the dead or sink his teeth into the flesh of pregnant women and eat their unborn children. Attewater gives Solomon a horrified look, suddenly realizing. Father Solomon is insane.No. You stop it. We both know he is guilty. But I cannot legally execute him without a witness or a confession. Sign this and we have a confession. Attewater glares at Solomon, then angrily signs the document. Solomon gestures to his Soldiers, who open the bull and pull Claude out. Attewater has to look away.This is the business of werewolf hunting and you had best develop a stomach for it. Because where there is one werewolf, there are two. And where there are two, there are more.Well, I've yet to come across a girl I wouldn't at least look at. The Captain ushers Roxanne inside. She meekly steps forward. A beat.I assume you came here with a purpose. She hurriedly empties Marguerite's purse on the table in front of Solomon. A mere handful of coins.Your brother has just confessed.It has been witnessed and notarized. He will hang in the morning.What do you think you are doing? Do you have any idea who I am? I am the Witchfinder General. I have fought in the Holy Land. I have waded hip deep in blood and resisted all the temptations of the infidels. And you seek to stay the hand of justice with such a tawdry bribe? Leave here, girl, before I have you whipped. Solomon gestures for the Soldiers and they forcibly drag her away. Roxanne struggles against them.How are you acquainted with the accused?And how long did this friendship last?And in this time, have you ever known the accused to converse with devils?What of this? Do you deny having conversed with a werewolf? She looks to Roxanne, who trembles with emotion. Then:Describe this encounter.And what was the nature of your conversation with it? Isabelle hesitates. Grandmother holds her breath.Very well. Isabelle Ordeville, in light of your willing confession, it is the decision of this court that on the night of the next full moon, you be left to the mercy of the werewolf. Cesaire silently buries his face in his hands.I told you, Bailiff. Where there is one werewolf, there are more. And the girl is the bait for our trap. Father Solomon strides off. Attewater watches him go...We, Bailiff Attewater, Father Auguste, and Father Solomon of Avignon, having in mind that you, Isabelle Ordeville of Villiers la Crois\u00c3\u00a9e in the Diocese of Saint-Flour, by your own confession, have committed acts of vulgar heresy, convict you of the sins of witches and condemn you to the mercy of werewolf. This is the sentence given. Solomon walks away and Attewater reluctantly follows. Through the holes in the mask, Isabelle sees Father Auguste make the sign of the cross and sadly turn away.No one shoots until I give the order. Attewater glances outside and sees Soldiers armed with longbows hidden all around the square. The Captain draws an arrow from his quiver. It's tip is made of silver.There. The Captain and Attewater follow his look. A BLACK SHAPE is stealing through the shadows toward Isabelle...Hold your fire... Isabelle frantically tries to free herself, her wrists torn and bleeding, but it's no use. Then, suddenly -- -- something SLAMS into the stocks. BANG! She can't see what it is. The stocks are hit again. Isabelle screams. Suddenly, the Shape moves into her field of view:Patience. It's close now... Henri brings the hammer down again and again and -- BANG! The lock is cleaved in two. Henri throws the stock open and helps Isabelle out of the mask. She looks like hell.Kill him. Attewater gives Solomon a horrified look. The Captain strings an arrow and draws it back, taking aim... Suddenly, Attewater pushes him aside, spoiling the shot. The arrow whizzes by Henri's head. Attewater calls out:At least you won't die alone now. Your friends will all hang with you. Suddenly... a long, hideous SNARL. Behind them. Father Solomon turns. Isabelle cranes her neck and sees... the Wolf emerge from the alley she just came out of. Solomon picks up his sword and stands to face it.If you come for her, you come through me. The Wolf GROWLS and raises its hackles. Solomon raises his sword. Just then, Henri and Roxanne run into the square, followed by a group of Villagers.Stay back! Henri hurries to Isabelle's side. The Villagers watch, breathless, as Solomon and the Wolf circle one another. Solomon's sword starts to tremble. Sweat breaks out on his brow. The Wolf SNARLS with an almost mocking leer. Then, with a loud battle cry, Solomon charges. The Wolf leaps at him. Solomon raises his sword... ... and the Wolf's jaws clamp onto his wrist. Solomon screams. The Villagers watch, horrified, as the Wolf twists back and forth, like a dog with a chew toy -- -- biting off Solomon's hand. The hand falls into the snow, still clutching the silver sword. Solomon cries out in agony. The Wolf turns toward Isabelle and SNARLS.This isn't over. They turn. Solomon kneels, holding his bloody stump.I am bitten. Henri and Isabelle exchange a look. A long beat. Henri walks over to Solomon, sword in hand. Solomon crosses himself and closes his eyes, unafraid. Roxanne turns away. Isabelle doesn't. Then Henri swings the sword. There is a soft THUMP as Solomon's head hits the snow. Henri throws the sword aside. Isabelle puts a reassuring hand on his shoulder.", "clean_line": "werewolf surprise outrage ripple crowd isabelle roxanne exchange shocked look werewolf dies returns human form killed werewolf human
