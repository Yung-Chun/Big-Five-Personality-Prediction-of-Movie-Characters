Further, I don't believe you'll use the money for food, but I believe you'll use it for, at worst, drugs, or, at best, whiskey, or . cigarettes. Also, I'm cheap. As Fletcher heads up the stairs...I've had better. He WINCES as he recognizes the words.

After an awkward silence--Yes, Your Honor.Yes, Your Honor.Mr. Rand had severe ethical objections to my client's case. Fletcher is incredulous. Somehow his greatest asset in the world, his mouth, has become his worst enemy.I have lower standards, Your Honor.I realize that, Your Honor, but I ' d really, really, really like a continuance.I can't lie!It certainly does.Fantastically fair.

I am certain what will happen if I take this puppy to trial. The verdict will be a stunning, humiliating defeat that will cut a spectacularly promising legal career off at the knees. Fletcher is referring to himself, of course, but Dana thinks he's speaking about her. She buckles.No? ! Mrs. Cole, this offer was a miracle. I'm talking about a walking-on-water, Lazarus-rising-from-the-dead,Seven!Mrs. Cole, you don't . understand, I-- But before Fletcher can finish, the judge enters.Your cellulite, Tubster.

Taking Max three thousand miles away is not fair.Last night--All right-- now let me tell you something...you're absolutely right. I'm guilty of all charges. I'm throwing myself on the mercy of your -court. Audrey doesn't know what to say. Fletcher seems very sincere, but she can't trust him.No, Audrey. Just talk to me abou t this first. Please.

He starts out.Mostly, I ' m a divorce lawyer.It means if you're daddy left your mommy, he'd call me.I help people fight over their money and their children.To marry a younger woman. To escape a loveless marriage and have cheap meaningless sex. To cling to an illusion of youth as his body gives way to sore backs, flat feet, spare tires, gum disease, hair loss, liver spots, kidney stones, clogged arteries, diabetes, goiter and eventual death. The kids EYES GO WIDE. A moment, then:Monster-Max.No. I ' d like to, but I can't right now. Max is disappointed again.I ' m sorry I missed your party la st night. How was your Uncle Glen?That's why he should have worn make-up. Fletcher elbows Max, playfully, trying to induce a laugh. Max doesn't laugh.Yeah, okay, urn... Your mother told me about... the wish you made last night. It came true. Max is amazed.Yes.No matter what.In the Olympics, yes. On . Channel 23, no.Not in a million years.Uh-uh.Only if you can't 'swim.Because your mom buys it.I . . . I don't know. I ' m . . . Hey, you know I'm coming over to nig ht. We're gonna play together.. Yes! This is absolutely an A-number one promise. You and I -- tonight -- baseball. Fletcher and Max do their ritual \"five\" slap.Now, listen, Max, I need a favor from you. I ' m in a little trouble today. I need you to take that wish back.Not to you.Max, sometimes grownups... need to lie. It's hard to explain, but i f . . . Look, here's an example. When Mommy was pregnant with you, she gained a little weight. Se venty pounds. I thought she was gonna give birth to a car. But she'd say to me \"How do I lo ok?\" So I'd say, \"Oh, honey, you're beautiful, you're glowing.11 Otherwise, I would've hurt Mommy's fee ling s. Understand? Max nods.Right. No... Max, I don't know how to get along in the grown-up world if I have to stick to the truth. I could lose my case, I could lose my promotion, I could even lose, my job... Do you understand? Max shakes his head \"no.\"Will you help me anyway? A moment -- then Max reluctantly nods.That's my boy! Fletcher opens the box, revealing a cake and candles.... He takes out two birthday hats. He puts one on Max and one on himself.Now, do whatever you did last night... only this time, make an un-wish. Not really happy, Max turns to the candles on the cake. He takes a breath-- and blows them out.Great! Great! Now to test --Only what?Well, then do it again. Only this time, mean it.Why not?!I explained this to you! I have to lie. Everybody lies! Mommy lies, even the wonderful Jerry lies--I am coming over, tonight, Max. You believe me, don't you? Max hesitates, then nods.I'll see you tonight, buddy... That's a promise. Max heads back to class. Fletcher picks up the cake, looks at it, then dumps it in a trash barrel.Short and shrivelled. Fletcher hurries up the steps when he spots Philip. He shields his face with his briefcase. Philip recognizes him anyway.No --No --No --Philip... I don't want to come over to your house! A long moment, then --No. He goes into his office. Greta is concerned. She follows him in, leaving his door open.My son hates me.O h yeah? Last night at his birthday party, he made a wish. That I wouldn't be able to tell a lie for one whole day.It came true.It's true. Didn't it seem odd to you that I kept telling the truth all morning?That's right! I am incapable of lying.Apparently until 9:15 tonight. It's a twenty-four hour curse.You don't believe me.Go ahead. Ask me something I ' d normally lie about. She thinks.Greta, please...

He's about to speak... when a WONDERFUL FEELING sweeps through him. After a momement, he grins.Would the Court be willing to grant me a short bathroom break?Not unless you want to mop up.What did I think? That I could piss for forty-five minutes?! He HITS HIS FOREHEAD in frustration... and gets an idea. He HITS HIMSELF AGAIN and AGAIN, SMASHES HIS HEAD INTO THE WALL, POKES HIMSELF IN THE EYES, YANKS ON HIS EARS, finally KNOCKS HIMSELF IN THE STALL, where he continues his attack. A MAN enters, hears a commotion from behind the stall door.Yes, I can.Hello.(summoning upThe twins.Sure.(sees VirginiaI've slipped into the seventh circle of Hell, thank you, and you? Virginia exchanges an anxious look with Falk.Well, basically the plan is I walk you through the tape step by step, I ask you questions--Exactly.Do esn't it? And I'll finish up with a dramatic series of questions, something like... \"Mr. Falk, isn't it true that you and Mrs. Cole have never made lo--\" But Fletcher GAGS. He CAN'T GET THE QUESTION OUT. The others look concerned, but he waves them off.Oh my God! I can't do it! I can't finish the question if I know the answer is a lie! At this moment Miranda and Mr. Allan come up the steps.C'mon! Gotta rephrase the question!Respondent calls... Lawrence Falk. Fletcher's clears his throat. Here goes...Mr. Falk, do you know my client, Virginia Cole?Isn't it true that your relationship with my client is entirely platonic, not? The \"not\" was INVOLUNTARY. It takes everyone by surprise.If I might rephrase your Honor.

If you don't remember, perhaps Mr. Falk will.So on this single document, you basically lied at every opportunity. I'm sure a woman as vain as you would also lie about her age. It says you were born in 1964. What's the truth? 1962? '60? How young did you try to make yourself?Oh, you bet it does, your Honor!

He BANGS the gavel.Sounds pretty damning, Mr. Reid.Two four seems like a pretty fair offer, Mr. Reid.What are you suggesting, Mr. Rei d? That Ms. Appleton's willingness to proffer such an offer betrays a lack of faith in her position?Strong corroborating evidence?You're pretty confident how this trial is going to come out, eh, Mr. Reid?You are some negotiator, Mr. Reid. If your client has half a brain, she'll jump at the offer.Well , Mr. Reid. Do we have a settlement? Fletcher looks pleadingly at his client, but she is firm. He shakes his head unhappily. The judge is irritated.Th ere' s no settlement. Trial to start at one-thirty sharp. He BANGS the gavel. Fletcher emits an involuntary whimper.Counselors, are we ready to begin?You may proceed, Mr. Reid. . Everyone turns to Fletcher in anticipation. In a voice quaking with fear...Ms. Appleton, you may begin.And why is that, Mr. Reid?Overruled.. As Dana pops the tape into a player, Fletcher anxiouslyNo questions? .All right, Mr. Reid. You may proceed.It can't wait?Who did this?-What did he look like?Bailiff, have the deputies search the building. A HUBBUB rises. He bangs the gavel.Under the circumstances, I have no choice but to recess this case until tomorrow morning at nine. Fletcher smiles serenly -- until ---- Unless, of course, you think you can still proceed? Fletcher covers his mouth in a desperate attempt to avoid answering, but he can't repress the truth.Can you?Splendid. I admire your courage, Mr. Reid. I'll give you a few minutes to compose yourself, and then we'll get started. Fletcher looks as if he has just been sentenced to death.It's hig witness!Call your next witness.You have no further witnesses?!Mr. Reid?Mr. Reid, we're not getting any younger... Fletcher quickly looks at the blowup of Virginia's prenup and her passport.Mr. Reid you have presented virtually nothing in the way of evidence and as such I have no choice but to rule in favor of --Mr. Reid, does this have a point?(banging hisIn light of this new evidence, the court must rule in favor o f the defense. Mrs. Cole is hereby awarded half of the marital assets -or thirtyrseven million three hundred and ninety-five thousand dollars. The courtroom ERUPTS. FLETCHER'S WON! Dana, Mr. Cole are devastated. 'O r d e r ! Order!! Now i understand both parties have agreed to joint custody. Is that correct?M r. Reid? Do we have an agreement on custody or not? Fletcher takes a distressed look at the children.In that case, there will be a custody hearing tomorrow mor ning at nine. Court is adj ourned! He BANGS THE GAVEL. Everyone gets up, but Fletcher's attention is drawn to a commotion between Virginia and her kids.We',re adjourned, Mr. Reid.Mr. Reid, you are out of order!That's enough, Mr. Reid --That's it, Mr..Reid.
