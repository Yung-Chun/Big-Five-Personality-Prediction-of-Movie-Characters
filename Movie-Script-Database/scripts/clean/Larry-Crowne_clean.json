You and me, alone in this room, and look at us now. Hurley has a frozen face. Larry looks at Andrews' smile.I think I know what this is about.Sounds like you're firing me.

Parking's impossible today!New to the Student Body.I'm going to be late for my first day of school.Please tell me this is Speech 217. Mercedes drops her bag on her desk. She is crushed and hates Larry Crowne. She takes up some chalk, turns to the board, then writes in large, shaky-yet-feminine script:Look at us, in two classes in a row.That Ms. Tainot is something else isn't she? I'm new to this coll ge life and, I confess, she sca es e This whole place scares me.I'm sorry. Larry Crowne, and I'm babbling.I like this guy...Money woes. Paying for gas, getting to school.\"College Graduate.\"That's a hunk of junk.It doesn't work.Two hundred.Two hundred.Forget it.All I need is the open road. Larry revs it, crashes into a hedge.Speck-tack-alar.School. College. I'm a student. What do you do?Yeah? I'd say 'have a great day' but that would be stating theYou take care. As the Rider takes off, Larry tries to do the same, but he stalls the engine. Cars honk horns at him.I am?It's only been one dayNew to the sport.Larry Crowne. With an 'e'.Not much fashion sense.You mean me?My presentation will be on the subject of a very particular procedure. \"How to make French Toast\", but I'll speak English... Larry has used up one card. Mercedes rolls her eyes and talks to herself in a MOVIE DEVICE way...Most people think syrup comes out of a plastic bottle.That went fast...Why not. There is a beat of a stare down between Dell Gordo and Larry, but then Dell starts to snap his fingers -- SNAP...SNAP...SNAP... -- the other join in until they are all snapping fingers like the Jets vs. Sharks. Talia too.I just bought it and ride around. Someone yells \"Saddle up!\"Other than school, I have nothing to do.I know where a yard sale is, like everyday.Follow me, boys and girl!College buddies.Entrez vous, sea food plate. Talia enters and looks around. The decor screams out: \"A man lives here.\"Good choice. As he puts it on, Talia drifts into the...I did most of the cooking, actually.The usual stuff between three people.Dark.Stay outta my way.Cooking for friends is sort of fun. Three hundred times a day is not.He is? Larry goes to the window.'We'll be right back after these messages.'Capice.L rry.Peace indeed.Speck-tack-alar. He peels out, on his way to school.That was a great presentation. I learned a lot from it.Smart stuff. Super smart. The women watch him go. As soon as he's out the door:Breaking even is not making profit, it's a theoretical assumption. Economics abhors an assumption. Talia is amused while sizing him up, from shoe to collar. Bad shirt... pleated pants, too short... running shoes.So what happens here?I have no idea what that means, but you betcha.Holy smokes! The place is crammed with vintage clothes. Racks and boxes and stacks of every fashion.You got inventory. She disappears in the back, rummaging around.What is all this worth? Out she ome with an assortment of men's clothes.Where?Denise. Larry.This a good time?I'll call you later.Well. Okay. Uh. Here's the deal.I'm going to miss a few months on the checks for the house.I hoped not to, but I there it is.I'm sorry.Let's start with six. Silence on the other end.I tried. I'm too much of a risk.Raul? Yes.I do?The USS Coral Sea.I gotta get to class before I miss the whole day. And I can't work mornings Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays.Deal. When will we talk salary?Then say it.I'm sorry, Ms. Tainot. I will not miss another class, this I vow.Inappropriate subject in mixed company.She's marred.Complimentary coffee is usually lousy.I got a job.Perry's Coffee shop. Breakfast all day. And I'm going to school.I was afraid of that.I can't make the payments on the house. I'm going to lose it, aren't I?You guys are forced to say that, aren't you?Should I begin? Mercedes signals 'Yeah, go ahead, asshole.'first crossing of the Equator...Unless you're looking at a chart, you don't even know the Equator when you cross it...Square footage at this price is a bargain.Chapter four.Ms. Tainot?Do you need a ride? Hop on.I was heading home.Seriously. I offer you a ride.I've yet to give anyone a lift on this but I think I can get you home with a scraped elbow, worst case.An attractive woman like you walking alone is a dumb idea.In those shoes? Mercedes ponders her shoes. He's got her. She stops.Put this on.Ain't you a ball of fun? Larry kick starts the scooter and off they go -- slowly.I do want to survive this night.Where am I taking you?I may use this as a presentation in class.I like your class. You're making us all do things we never thought we could.Someone's getting pinched... A COP CAR with its cherry top flashing, has pulled over a Drunk Driver. It's Dean. They're making him touch his nose, breathe into a test kit. Mercedes starts laughing.Bad night for that guy.Unit 114.You don't want to give me your pass code.This it?I'll get the door for you Larry opens the door, reaches in, turns on the light.What?What?What are you talking about?When I say 'what', it means I get it and have already purposefully forgotten everything. Call it irony.Goodnight, Ms. Tainot. She doesn't move, but flashes her ring finger.I assumed you preferred MsThat's a long story and it's late.Thanks. He gently removes the strap and helmet from her head. be a bit sexy. Her hair tumbles out.We all have crushes on you. Even the gals.Wow...Yes, you do..Goodnight, whoever you are!Epilog. School today.If we had ended up making out, you still wouldn't hear it. Talia slugs him. All in play...How are the Triplets? Groggy, Puffy, and Grumpy. He means the hangover.Last i ht? Let's see, what was I doing? Studying some. Working some. Can't recall. I've forgotten everything that happened last night as best a gentleman can.I wouldn't want that.Sure. Nothing happened. At all.None.I have to sell my car. Put a new top on it.If I could afford a new top I could afford to keep it.Half my UniMart salary.I'm looking back on the year Denise left as the good old days.Everyone keeps saying that.The odds of two people on the same street winning the lottery are worse than one person on the street winning the lottery.Vick? How you doing? Larry Crowne. Hurley looks at him. She looks tired. And stupid in her Cashier's Apron.Why are you on the Register?Cash. No receipt. Hurley is robotic.'Consumerism'.The handwriting is loopy. Looks like 'Consumerism'.You missed Matsutani's class. Review for the final.What? Why?Talia. Don't be a fool. Stay in school. Don't throw away your education.Japanese characters go the other way and that says Soy Sauce.Might not make it. I have finals!She's insane.Frances Taylor-Briegh. You have a problem with your order?Mrs. Tainot.There's no way in creation I screw up French Toast.You'll be the judge of that. The is a beat of silence.So, your meal is satisfactory?Would you let my boss know so I don't lose this job?Shall I prepare you another batch?Then I will return to my station.. Mercedes watches him go.Priceless at a buck apiece.You'll get me top price.Here's lunch as promised! The BIG STORK PIZZA GUY pulls up in a different car but the same sign.Jack Strang. Wow. This is irony.Jack. I need two bucks back. Times are tough.Ah. Forget it. Keep the change.I add chicory and a bit of vanilla. Trick I picked up in the Navy.Didn't expect that. Thanks, Mrs. Tainot.This has turned into a full time gig. Out of necessity.I'll have to see.Cars not much. Devices some. They rise.In my old job, I'd have steered you to a Vortex unit. The MapGenie interface is clumsy and the menu needs too many inputs. He is reaching into the car, across her to tap the unit.Ah. The Auto On Feature is engaged. Menu. Select. Features. Auto Voice. Select. Change? Yes. On. Off. Done? Yes. Save. Back. Back. Back. Exit. While he was doing that, Mercedes was smelling what she could of Larry. She liked it. She looked at his neck, his ears. And smelled him.All better now. Should be able to find your way. Nothing to do now but say goodbye.My Boss. Back to work.I met you.

{"raw_line": "I'm here. Shut up. Turn off! Stepping from her sub-compact, she struggles into a pair of heels, as in this state she drives barefoot. If only her huge Thermo-cup held a hair of the dog she might not walk such a crooked mile from the parking lot to the campus. Larry -- in his car -- screeches around a corner. He is frantically looking for a place to park, but as this is the first day of term, the lot is jammed! He nearly hits Mercedes Tainot.Jerk!This is the Faculty Lot. We've earned degrees for these spaces. Students park on Mars.I bet it won't be the first time.This is it?My day has just been made and it's only 8:02 in the morning!While earning a Masters in Shakespearean Political Discourse from Vassar, I learned to care. Caring is a prerequisite for this class I have to teach in thisParticipate. Show up on time. Care. And stay awake the 55 minutes three dawns a week I have to be here, or I will fail you and not care. My name is Ms. Tainot. Not 'tie- knot'. Tay-no. You will each address the class on Wednesday. A procedure. How. To do. Something. Pinedo has panic in her eyes. Public speaking terr fies her. Dibiasi raises his hand.Why are you here, Steve?Busik. Of course... Dibiasi's cell phone rings.You'd think so.Tap Dancing. Ping Pong. Water Torture. And Speech at SunriseWhy wouldn't I believe you?You were looking at porn. She takes a nice pull on that icy drink. Oh fine. Thought Police. I saw some erotica. I'm a man, I admit it.Took you a while.Yes you are. She bangs her head.Brain freeze.I have no secrets from you. I share the whole miserable slate.We now all know how to Burpie. Thank you.Make me the bad guy.Mr. Crowne. My bad. Larry goes to the podium - armed with a huge stack of 3x5's.Go.M classes were once filled with e rnest young men ready to learn all I had to teach them. Cute boys fresh out of High School who all had crushes on me from day one. Now look at my cadre. Dibiasi. Bound for jail. Mack. Treating college like another tour of combat. Crowne. If this was Hamlet, he'd be Osric in Act 5. The part that is always cut.Busik, I am going to kill you. You can't suggest these saps take Shorthand or Oral Hygiene? Bring me in at this ungodly hour for 2 minutes on French toast? Busik looks at Mercedes, signals a 'not bad, eh?' about Larry. She is a stone face.Great. The history of the sugar maple tree now. Thank you Wikipedia. Larry still has a dozen cards to go.Breakfast may never be ready. Larry gathers his cards. Busik gives him a 'bravo!'Next. Pinedo tries to volunteer to go next...Are you clairvoyant?Did you notice? No script. No notes. So it can be done. The class breaks up. Pinedo makes it a point to pick up some DynaSem brochures. Larry remains, scribbling notes.White, Siler and Koss, you are upMr Crowne? Can you move alongWhen was the last time you looked at your life and saw nothing but fraud and desperation?Well I'm joking of course!!! She pretends to laugh. A little too much.Go to hell...It was. Yes.How?Okay.Wait a ding dong minute. 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9. Someone is missing! Who cut my class? She lets slip OUT LOUWhere's Larry Crowne?! Everyone looks at her.Anyone know why?I don't believe this! Ditching me? He ditched me? Not okay. Larry Crowne, you are on my Shit List. Everyone shares looks like they've witnessed a Lover's Spat. Speaking quietly in their seats...Yes. Tell us more about your man dolls. Mack is humiliated now.Is that Larry Crowne!?Vows come cheap, Larry Crowne. You'll lead off next assignment with three minutes on a personal first. A story, with details, not a laundry list or slide show. And, as I told Dibiasi, no one wants to hear about the first time you got laid. She eyes Talia with venom in her eyes.Or the most recent. Talia laughs out loud!I got engaged to a teacher/writer with two books in print...Who did? I'm married to an ex- teacher turned blogger with two books in print. And oh, yes, he has the libido and internet access of a 13-year-old.Why can't all my students be like y u?And that Toy Poodle he keeps on a leash! Mercedes eyes Larry in his car.That's why he's in college! To get laid!(talking to herself in the MOVIEA repackaged Larry Crowne won't fool me. Shame on you. Going after jail bait, you criminal. Insert Viagra joke here...Anyone recall anything from that?That was a memorable nugget.Mr. Koss to the lectern, please. More anecdotes come from the class about Larry's speech. Mercedes heard none of them...I'm smiling...If they help, they help.\"Chillax?\" Did you use the word \"chillax?\" That come from your Bloggers Thesaurus?You lie to me, Dean. Every day. You. Lie. To. Me.I'm not complaining. I'm stating the truth. I teach while you pretend to work.Drive, asshole! Drive away!Drive straight til you hit a cliff on the coastline!LOSER! I MARRIED A LOSER!!! With a tiny dick! Tiny dick LOSER!Oh, chillax!!!I'm throwing rocks at my own car !! Janet and Tony are aghast - silent - in shock.The jerk who just deserted me? My husband of 4 friggin' years! She stomps off into the night. Janet and Tony don't know what to do with each other now.I loved these shoes once. Stupid shoes. She sits at he stop, about to cry. Then she sort of does cry, for so any reasons. In the distance, we hear...No. He takes off his helmet.Jesus Christ.And bust up your romp in the glen with Bambi?What do men see in irritating free spirits? Mercedes starts walking.Seriously. I don't want one. Larry shuts off his scooter, pushing it along with his feetI am walking, Crowne, as thoughts black boil up from my soul. MajorI need a man flirting with me right now like I need a dog crapping on my lawn. I'm hoofing it.A man who notices shoes.It won't be a terrible thing if you kill us both.Are you really going to go this slow?Fine. I have time to window shop. Oh look, a sale on tires at AutoUSA. And here comes a mailbox. I've never noticed their perfect design and colo scheme. This isDown to Portola and left to Havenhurst. Havenhurst to Palermo. Right on Palermo till I yell stop.Try it and you'll flunk. I am joking.Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.Put the shovel away and just get me home, 'kay? Up ahead, flashing lights.Hail our City's Finest.Measure his dick, officer! He's too diminutive to drive!Best night I've had in years! Drive on, McDuff!Thanks for the ox-cart ride. Like a sleepwalker. Stands at the Alarm Pad.I can see the Alarm Pad. I know the code. But my hands aren't working.Look away now.W ere's my purse? Oh yeah. My car. The key please? It's buried in that plant. Larry digs out an Altoids tin. Rattles it.Why I think it is!Take one step inside and I call security. Larry steps away from the door.And forget this ever happened.This whole sorry chapter tonight.You passing up Gidget for a flat old coot like me.Sarcasm. Irony is when Gallant lands in the drunk tank while Goofus scoots me home.Mrs. I'm Mrs. Tainot. Can you not see that?When we presume we make a pretty pair of asses of me and you or something like that.Help yourself. She sticks her neck out. If this were a movie, they might kiss right now. Larry pauses. Mercedes looks at him. He's not a bad looking guy. He starts to undo the helmet strap.I noticed something on the ride.Do you have a crush on me? Single student. Unattainable teacher. It's common. Larry has no idea what to say.You want to make out with me, you can. I know I'm not a third rate Audrey Hepburn wanna-be but I stillMy spouse won't be home for 3 to 5 years. Larry ponders this moment for as long as he can. He shouldn't, of course. But, damn. She is Mercedes Tainot. Bang.Pretty dang good. I still got it, no?Whoever I am...Mr. Crowne? A moment please?I need a few moments alone with Mr. Crowne thank you.Last night was a confluence of too many things happening in too shortI had no right to judge you or your relationships. Date who you want. Larry has no idea what that means.But what happened last night -- between adults -- was inappropriate. If gossip were to circulate, the problem could be more than just embarrassing. My status as a professor could be tarnished.happened before.With parking attendants. Strangers at parties when I've had a bit too much of the demon rum. This was the first time with a student.So there will be no bravado among you and your pals?Thank you, Mr. Crowne.Thanks for coming.I knew you'd be on the computer.Are we making a mistake here?Point made. We could change things. We could start right now.Because we have history, Dean. But first, my thoughts... I've got to address drinking. I should be able to comprehend and respond to both sides of our conversations. And the morning shower should be refreshing, not a hangover cure.Really?Okay. Now, you. Dean is caught short.There are plenty of items on the relationship agenda but let's start here.I'm not saying that.Here I have surprise topics. Friday, in a Lightning Round, you must wax on that topic for 2 minutes without pause, repetition, or lack of charm. No notes. One visual aid.Spuds. Can't wait. Dibiasi draws a paper.Who is that?Fine. 2 minutes on Consumerism. Calimeris picks. Hers is loopy, too.No idea. Just pick another.As long as alcohol's out of my grasp.Great. Sugar can replace tequila in my bloodstream, my thighs, and the folds in my neck.

you get the Hot Wheels? Talia is shaking her hair free from her helmet. Larry fails to recognize her from Econ prime.That machine's a classic.You're in Matsutani's Econ with me.That class is straining my coconut.Didn't know you scooted.Give me your number. I'll introduce you to like-minded enthusiasts.'Larry'? I don't think so. I used to be Kathleen but one day I looked in the mirror and saw a girl named Talia. Putting you in as 'Lance'. Check your texts and we'll do us some scooting.I know! Gotta change that... Larry sees Mercedes Tainot walking from the Faculty lot, and doesn't want to be late again.Then get going!! Talia watches him go. Likes him thus far...Hey Monkey! Dell Gordo plants a kiss right on Talia's lips. She kisses him back. Larry sinks a little.This is Lance Corona. Classmate and good guy, so far.Snap along, Lance or you can't join the gang. Larry, clumsily, starts snapping too. After a few bars...Stan knows engines and junk.We ride, Monkey! Larry's heart breaks a tiny bit, suffering as he does from Talia-on-the-heart.If it was Saturday we'd look for yard sales.Lead the way.You have any old clothes?Layer this... with this.I LOVE THIS! Where did you GET IT?Diamonds in a diamond mine.I gotta see Chez Lance.No sign of a woman around here for years. Drape a scarf over thatAlphabetical order. No artistic chaos for you. She closes her eyes and picks out an LP at random.Spin this platter, Mr. DJ?Breakfast nookie!Did Denise make you breakfast in here with a little apron and lipstick perfectly applied?Patience thought she was stuck up and seriously fleeced you. Larry can't believe his neighbors are so loose-tongued.So what happened there, my Lance?Like me.Kitchen, Monkey! Dell Gordo has walked into Larry's house.That Denise. What a fool. You a e way cooler than you appear. She leaves. Dell Gordo lingers.Something complicated.You ready? Re-invention Big BoyI started in the smallest unit.No one should ever buy clothes off the internet. You have to feel the fabric and test the drape...A lot to me. Try these on.Anywhere. Fashion is no place for modesty. Strip. He does.This is a service to humankind, Lance. It hurts me to see a Top Cat dressed like an ex-hockey player. You gotta look gorgeous from shoe to collar. Starting now. Larry is taking off his pants just as Dell Gordo has pulled up on his scooter.Lance! My boyfriend's here! Put your pants on! Larry, in fact, has his pants off.That woman is one clenched fist of fury.She must not be having any amok lovin'.Without a workout in the Inner Sanctum a few times a week I can't concentrate.You you want to fix it with your teacher? Bang her. Talia slides a photo of herself making a face into Larry's wallet, then adds a condom in its foil.You'd kill two birds in one bush. Nothing wrong with a campus romance. Otherwise life is what? Breakfast work, coffee, school, lunch, scoot, class, shop, talk, Mexican food, a movie, glass of wine or two then bed? That's not living.Bet she'd give you an A plus.It's going to storm till next year.I do not scoot in the rain.My savior! Look at your new schmatas.Chef Corona! Steam us some corn bread? The others pretend to be grumpy diners: Feed us! What's a Reuben Sandwich? Where's my Sanka!Woman on deck! Raul looks up from his Spanish Language Newspaper.I'm a friend of Lance's.Is he, Lance?Rah-ool. Rhymes with ya-cool. Are ya' cool, Raul?As boss, do you make up the menu?Is that a tough but fair job?Can Lance take a break?The artist formerly known as Larry. I need his expertise.Maurice says I'm saving his life by renting the space.You sure?You make it sound so simple!! Talia is so excited she grabs Larry and showers his forehead with kisses. Appearing out of nowhere: Dell Gordo.Lance! Chick alert! Larry is beside her. They stop.You are not going to believe how Fate meets cute! She u-turns and Larry follows her, confused.And I've been calling you 'Lance'.Hey. Bambi was a boy.Not me. I love riding in the night. Magic happens.Lance! A Betty on your Scooter after midnight? Holding on, her arms around you, pressed against your back, is a license to at least cop a feel.I'm done w th college.Because I'm going into business.And don't drink and drive or do drugs and quit smoking and eat vegetables. I don't. I stopped. I did. I do.Pretty much. Oh, look. Maurice gave us free tattoos. I wanted something in Japanese so check this out. She shows it to him, just above her butt-crack. It's two Japanese characters.That one says 'courage'. That one says 'spirit'. Courageous Spirit. Dell Gordo knocks on the window as Larry has his hands on his gal's butt... \"What's this, Lance??\"Oh shut up.Be here for our Grand Opening!Bambi Romp in the Glen.
