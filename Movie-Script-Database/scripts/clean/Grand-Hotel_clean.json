A man in the textile industry naturally has to know Manchester.We have a good many connections in England, naturally.We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.No water -- What a place!Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...We did not approach you.It isn't so -- this was a response to a tentative feeler of your own.Scratched -- We did not take the initiative.Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.I know you did -- I said you did --Evil days -- I've shown you here -- -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.What?You've decided against the merger?Then, it's all over?Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester. You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester.Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen.Gentlemen, I am now free to announce... ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.Next week.Next week.Yes, it has been put through -- it has been put through.Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.That.No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone.

I'm winning more than I used to earn in a year -- double what I used to earn.Where is the Baron -- where are you, Baron?Excuse me, gentlemen.You've lost everything?Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again...I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win. It's good, -- come along, Baron.All of that at once, Baron?I'm having luck for the first time in my life.Baron, I drink and win -- I drink and win -- I win and drink!Oh, don't go, gentlemen! -- Stay a while. Be my guests!I oughtn't to presume, but I -- I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it. Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the --Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun. Oh, the pain.I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.Oh, I've got to find it.No -- I must find it -- Fourteen thousand two hundred marks.I'm all right, Doctor. There's no pain now -- only you don't know what that money means to a man like me.You don't know, because you've never lived like a dog -- in a hole -- and saved and scrimped. My life hangs upon that money, Baron. Nobody gives you anything. You have to buy everything and pay cash for it. I wanted to pay for my last days with that money. Every hour costs money. I've nothing -- nothing but that pocketbook. I must have it back.Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, Baron.No.Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.Oh -- what -- what --Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --Preysing?Stay here.Mr. Preysing -- Oh, Mr. Preysing --Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.Yes, the police must be called.Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.Yes, I know them --We must call the police, your excellency.Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself. There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.Please, officer.What's the matter?You loved the Baron, didn't you?So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.Then why did you have anything to do with him?Yes, of course, -- money!Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know -- I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?Do you like me better?When is the next train leaving for Paris? -- Yes... Get two tickets for me... and my bill please... and the lady's -- Miss Flaemm's. We have to hurry let's pack -- we'll have breakfast on the train.Cab please!And now we travel, Flaemmchen... Glad?Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?Yes, Paris -- Grand Hotel.Oh, there must be one in Paris...

time for the performance. I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life. Veronal didn't even help me to sleep.I can't dance tonight --Let us cancel the engagement.Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.The peals are cold -- everything is cold -- finished -- it seems so far away -- so threadbare -- the Russians -- St. Petersburg -- the Imperial Court -- the Grand Duke Sergei -- -- Sergei -- dead -- Grusinskaya -- it's all gone.The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.Send it away -- I shan't need it.Come in.Madam Grusinskaya will not require her car -- no -- she will not be going to the theatre.The performance -- the performance -- the performance.It is not stage fright -- it's something more --Last night?... There was no applause.That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished -- the last beat and... ...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing. A man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We are dead -- it's finished.I'm cancelling the engagement.The house is not full -- Is it really full?Oh -- but it can't be.All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.My coat.Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.Take them back, Suzette.Hurry, Suzette.I want to be alone.Suzette, please go, I want to be alone.I wish to be alone.The end -- over -- finished --The Western Theatre --Western Theatre?The stage -- Mr. Pimonov -- the ballet master...

Good night, good night, my dear -- goodbye... Pimenov, how is it going, badly?... Uh?... Who's dancing?... Desprez?... Oh -- and how is it?... Oh, -- oh, I see -- they didn't miss me?... They didn't miss me. They didn't miss me -- good night, Pimenov...Oh -- I'm sorry, yes... I have finished.What do you want here?Why do you hide in my room?Because you love me -- you love me?I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that. No. I am not afraid. It is strange.Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?Certainly.Why do you look at me like that?And then --?And -- and --Yes -- tired...Alone. All alone. Oh, you strange -- strange creature.Strange man...Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --He disappeared. Later he was found dead.Go away. Who are you --?You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.I want to be alone.I want to be alone --Just for a minute then.You -- man...Thank you -- you are gallant. What a sentimental scene. Grusinskaya weeping is a sight worth seeing. It is many years since she did such a thing... You frightened me -- badly. You're responsible for this -- painful scene.The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?Why do you smile?What can you see?No.I think you had better go now. The key is on the floor.What?I want to be alone.For just a minute then. No -- oh, no!Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?Really?No?And?And what do you do -- now?Oh! What a picture -- and what else?That's a silly joke.What is the matter?Flix!Oh --Did you come here just -- just for that? Oh -- it's horrible.You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.I'll not denounce you.So --But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---And now?Yes -- yes -- yes.Quickly -- here.Good morning, Suzette.Oh, yes, Suzette.Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.Yes, Suzette.You must go now.There -- it begins.Hello -- hello -- Meierheim? Yes...No --What?... Cancel Vienna?... Are you mad? We always have great success in Vienna... Certainly not. Come here and see me... yes... good-bye.There -- the day begins... I must go to rehearsal.Yes.Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.Suzette will be back here in a minute.Shall I see you again?Suzette will be back here any minute.Very early in the morning.Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.Why later?I'll give you what you need -- I have money.Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?I shall dance and you'll be with me and then -- listen -- After that you will come with me to Lake Como, I have a villa there. The sun will be shining. I will take a vacation -- six weeks -- eight weeks. We'll be happy and lazy. And then you will go with me to South America -- oh!You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.Yes, Pimenov... Yes... where are you, in your room? Come, I will see you now... hurry.Not that dark dress -- something light -- bright -- it's a sunny morning, Suzette.Come in.Good morning, Pimenov.Pimenov, I have an idea -- a new ballet -- it must have mad music -- I'll explain it to you later. But now, hurry to the theatre -- I want full rehearsal -- properties -- full ballet and some musicians. Hurry -- Quickly. I will be there --Yes, Pimenov. One minute, Suzette, I will call you.Hello -- will you -- will you get me Baron von Gaigern, please... yes... Baron von Gaigern -- yes...Will you get me Baron von Gaigern, please... Cherie... yes... it is you... nothing... good morning, good morning, cherie... nothing... no... just to tell you I'm happy.Go on please -- go on, Suzette.Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.No?Why do you think --They've brought me such good luck -- you --I'm worried about you.On the train?Till then.I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses. Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.Goodnight, Suzette.Hello -- can you tell me if Baron von Gaigern is in his room -- ring him. Cherie, I must wake you or you'll miss the train. ...yes... are you ringing, he may be asleep. Cherie, you must get up and fetch me from my room -- I'm longing for you, Cherie -- I have not been to sleep -- I kept thinking you would come to me. ...Oh, but he must answer. Ring -- ring -- ring.Cherie, hurry -- hurry -- hurry. Answer the phone -- what is the matter. Ring him -- ring him. Where are you -- where are you, Cherie? Why don't you answer? Well, ring him -- please -- please.Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov?But when did he go? How do you know?Baron von Gaigern has left?When? How long ago?Wait a minute.
