And as a penance they gave me ten 'Hail Marys' and ten 'Our Fathers'......Now, between you and me... You know how I feel about such things... 'Hail Marys'...'Our Fathers'...No imagination......If I'm going to do penance at all, I'll do it the way I think it would be done...by me, that is...according to my own trespasses. You know what I mean.Y'know...she's really good-looking... really good-looking. I've gotta say that again. She's really good- looking...but she's black... You can see that real plain. When you get down to it though... there's not much of a difference, is there? Well...is there?Oh great...hey - Winstons?OK, ok...No...I'll be ok for a week.Nope...Look...I don't know. What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something? Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head. Right?Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.You're right. You're right. Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts. You know that.Michael, believe me. You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes. I vouched for him and he'll come through. I promise. I'll talk to him and straighten him out. Don't worry, OK?What do you think? 'If a man have a hundred sheep, and one of them stray, will he not leave the ninety-nine in the mountains, and go in search of the one that has strayed? And if he happen to find it, amen I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety- nine that did not go astray. Even so, it is not the will of your Father in Heaven that a single one of these little ones should perish.'... Ok that's very nce but...Giovanino! Where have you been?The queen!(refering to JOHNNYI know but let's hear it anyway.All right, forget it. Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?Don't go to any trouble. We believe you... We believe you.Be careful.I'm surprised at you Tone. I mean you've had the place for over a year now. Nothing different...same old place...ordinary...flat...no imagination.For instance, the difference between me and you is this...you take that panther back there. I'd put him right up here above the bar...nice cage, you know? Nothing ordinary in my place. What good is it? You get robot customers. They come in, drink beer, go to the bathroom, and go home. No sir.See what I mean? A question please...'Is this what you call living?'Well, go ahead, whaddaya want? Someone to hold it for you?This place is dead. If I had a place...every night...lively.And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE... I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?Look who's talking. Pretentious bullshit. Who's the guy with William Blake and the tigers, eh?Don't forget what's-his-name there in the bathroom.Not quite...but keep trying.Let's have a game after we close.C'mon Tony, waddaya say?Anybody wanna have a game?Michael, give us a lift.Oh Jesus Christ...what's this.Should I slap him?I can't get over the way he just kept going at him.Away from the neighborhood.Get him in.Disgraceful.C'mon Johnny.Yeah, thanks, it's ok.Don't answer.No, she isn't.Listen, I'll be ok...it's the best thing. You're not going to be able to take care of Grandma out here and still get to work, you know that... Yes the place will be here, I'll take care of it. Yeah don't worry about me, I'll take care of myself.No...no parties. I'll eat. Mom, look, just don't worry...ok?You'd better make a move kid. He thinks you're trying to screw him.Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble. You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.You couldn't handle shit. You just better come through with some kind of payment on Tuesday...anything. Understand? Hold onto your pay- check this week.What do you mean?You sick or what? You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid. Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?Don't promise...just deliver.I won't wait until Tuesday. I'll break your arms right now.I could have told you that.Don't do that. You'll scare Teresa if you try to sneak in.That's not funny. You gonna be a jerk-off all your life. Grow up. You want something to eat from your aunt's house you go knock on her door, understand?Ok, we'll go for lunch.Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...Well...Sure...it's not that...I mean...Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself. God willing.Maybe, who knows.Nobody knows anything, believe me.See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.You know...like restaurants, night clubs...Don't ask.Did you?CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable. The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared. Not half as much as we were though.You missed the point. The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation. He thinks he's in good standing.Not sick...just stupid. Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.Don't worry.Don't look at me like that, I can see this is not going to get us anywhere. She's a good kid, what am I supposed to do. In a way I'm doing her a favor...no??? How many guys you know feel this way about an epileptic? Don't get me wrong, I'm no saint...not yet.But I'm not like the Pharisee who said \"Oh God I thank thee that I am not like the rest of them.\"...no...I like to think of myself as the Publican......'Oh God be merciful to me the sinner!' I'm not taking advantage of her. I swear to you that if she meets someone she'd like to marry......I'll cut out. \"If Thy eye is an occasion of sin to thee......pluck it out and cast it from thee.\" \"Woe to the man through whom scandal does come.\" I'm sure you'd agree this is no time to get tied down. Like the priesthood......they don't get tied down do they? \"Have I not a right to do what I chose? Even so the last shall be first and the......first last. For many are called but few are chosen.\"Ok, how's everything going?No.What pipes?That bad, huh?Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.I don't understand, where's Groppi?My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.Is my uncle back there?Thanks!Marie, are there Columbian coffee beans in this coffee?Just a second. Let me taste it.Yes, I'd say there are some Columbian coffee beans in this coffee, but only about 39%.You see. You probably don't notice this Marie, but Colombian coffee beans are rich coffee beans. Bursting with that good, deep coffee flavor. Picked when they are ripe to the point of perfection. The beans of course, are protected by the tall South American Guama trees.Then the bean pickers come down and pick each bean by hand. Bean by bean, all heavy with flavor. And they load them into boxes, one box at a time, box by box.Like, looking at my uncle back there. One way is the obvious; ...man outside the law. On the other hand, instead of a breakdown of order there is a creation of order and instead of the breakdown of law, there is the creation of law...In this society which needs new law because 'What's a crowbar compared to a share of stock. What's the robbing of a bank compared to the founding of one and what's the murder of a man to the gainful employment of that man.' 'Do not think that I have come to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to destroy but to fulfill.' ...Amen.Uncle, how are you feeling?About that shooting last night...I was there and...You're right uncle. I must have gotten it confused with something else.About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it. He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.Yes...I understand...I'll be careful.No...we can come back in a couple of weeks. Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.Bore.Yeah...but don't worry about that now. The Hemmingway one is first.Take your time. I don't care.That's the word...preoccupied.Let's go back inside.See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?No. Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?That W.A.S.P. bastard.Watch your language.Uhuh...probably a good idea. Why don't you do it this time?Well you can't blame them in a way.I know...I know....He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time. I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?Of all people. Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara. C'mon.You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.I...I'm selling encyclopedias...er a magazines...newspapers...I'm conducting a survey...I...Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?Know where he is?How much farther?Now, don't get excited.'The stone which the builders' reject will become the cornerstone'...I think.Ok.Oh...around...why?Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...Not now...in a few minutes...ok?Oh Michael, look...Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...? Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?We'll settle it tonight.Firecrackers! No...no.Sure, see that guy over there......him. He's got the best.What's a'matter?How much?Let's go to the movies...on you.You know damn well what's going to happen tonight. I'll probably get drunk at that party...it isn't every day you send one of your best friends off to war for God and country... gotta have a party. I mean, he's a nice kid.I don't know what You think of him but that's between You and him anyway...I can't help feeling sorry for him though. Has a talent but doesn't use it...His brain. An 'Unprofitable servant who shall be cast forth into the darkness outside, where there will be......the weeping and the gnashing of teeth'...or something like that. My talent's my brain too but I use my talent...I'm not saying that I'm a genius...You'll probably be the first one to agree on that, but I can tell the difference between the intelligent and the stupid. Take the army for example...That's there and I'm here and that's the way it's going to stay!I have come to create order... Scotch and water please.May God be with you.Salute!!!'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?''My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.''Thou sayest it; I am a king. This is why I was born and why I have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.'I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!He said he'd be here.He'll be here. Look, take this for now.How much was the original loan again?$3,000. Shit! Can we hold it at $3,000?'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...''But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.''Father...forgive them...for they know not...what they do...'Now don't get excited. Don't get excited!!Johnny it's me, Charlie.Cut it out stupid. It's me.What are you...crazy?Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.What the fuck...Let's get out of here.That's not going to help.It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?How?That'll help you out fine. That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this. You understand? I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out.I don't get involved with anything, you understand that? Nothing! I'm clean as far as you know...right?That's what I get for getting involved. Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok? This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him. If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand? I'm not asking I'm telling you!!'Could you not, then, watch one hour with me?''The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.'I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?Hemmingway. Killed himself. I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.Wasn't a book...was a short story.Nothing.\"Francis Macomber.\"\"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber.\"Oh yes, he's pretty good.It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.What did he do?Teresa.No, she's got epilepsy.What do they expect you to say?All right.Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.Oh yeah, that's a possibility....looks good...things look good, if I may say so myself. Don't you agree? Unless there's something You know that I don't know?Hot as hell...You're not the only one going through Hell kid.'If thy hand is an occasion of sin to thee, cut it off. It is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire. 'Where their worm dies not and the fire is not quenched.'Next time, bet with your own kind.It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.No - not yet - just blessed.Oh Joey, really...we're all friends here--let's cut the bullshit.Whatever, just lets settle this and it's all forgotten.Keep your mouth shut.C'mon -- I'm movin' in on you? Let's have another drink and forget about it.Shut up stupid.You got some mouth!You got no honor Tony. Charge!No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.What are your plans?Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...Of course, 'The Season of the Witch' won't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch.Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie. Listen, I'm looking for your cousin. Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday. I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is? I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.I'll see you later.Diane, how are you feeling?You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a... aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...No, I'm serious...You're really good.In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.No...no stripping...as the hostess.Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.Ok. Chinese. We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.Bye.We'll be here.Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?...that sonofabitch.Are you serious? Me move in with you. You crazy?Teresa, get these ideas out of your head...I've got enough on my hands right now...with that bastard cousin of yours. You wanna move? Go ahead. By all means! But keep me out of it...I've got nothing to do with it...you understand...nothing.Where were you? Answer me, you sonofabitch! Where were you?Shut up!You had me going crazy!Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you. We've been in here calling...Don't be smart.Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...Go ahead! Go on! And we'll see what happens to you without me.What do I do? You know anything about this?You crazy bastard! What are you trying to do, ruin me?You...You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?Then don't show up tonight and see what happens.How much have you got for Michael tonight?Here, take twenty bucks. With your eight that makes twenty-eight bucks you give Michael. I keep the thirteen for the weekend. Maybe we'll eat some Chinese food later.Take it. I'm doing it for you, stupid!Oh, cut it out, will ya?NO!!! What do you think I am, crazy???Come on.Watch this kid for me. I have to go someplace but I'll be back soon to get Michael and him together. Don't even let him go to the bathroom.Don't you move!!!6th Avenue and Waverly Place, fast please.No...don't stop...just pass real slow, OK?Stop here. No...what am I...crazy??? Take me back to where you picked me up.Mind your own business.You can see things aren't going too well for me at the moment. My willpower and powers of persuasion are not what they usually are today. My ability to control events and situations are wanting. I know. I know...what can I say...I offer this as part of my penance.Who's the girl?How do you know?She don't look Jewish.I love you.Ever since that first day I saw you at the convent with the nuns, playing volleyball, I couldn't help myself.Yeah why?It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?Nothing's private...Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.Take her away from me...I mean physically take her away from me.He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.Yeah, where's the rest?You're really crazy.You stupid bastard! Never pull a gun unless you intend to use it.Hide the gun. Throw it away. Anything. Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?No.Forget it.Good idea.I guess you could safely say that this evening has been so far very unimpressive as far as my efforts are concerned...more unproductive. Now, I'd like to know what you do, for an encore, Lord? I know penance is penance but this is something else.Go ahead! Play the radio...play music...you're going to a party... louder! Go ahead. Louder. A party. Lots of fun.Hey, what is this guy, crazy?My uncle didn't come?Kennedy.It's an open ticket. I can go anywhere up to $350.So I'll send you a postcard from wherever. If I get there.Yeah.No.Hey, come on...Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me. My mother can send me some. I don't know.Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself. I'll write.I'll say that I'm travelling.Thanks for the ride.Take care of that tiger.Panther! Same thing...Sure.
