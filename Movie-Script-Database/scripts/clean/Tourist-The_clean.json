{"Tourist-The": {"CARA": {"raw_line": "Oui.Ow!I think I'm going to need your help.My zipper... It's stuck.Don't be afraid.It doesn't matter.Don't give up so quickly.Thanks.Cara.The dining car would be lovely, thank you.Are you ill?So you decided to take a holiday on the Orient Express?Your honeymoon?Should we ask the waiter to set another place?If you'd like to tell me.That's awful.I'm sorry, Frank.I wouldn't touch it. I'm loyal to you.You read spy novels.I'm a mysterious woman on a train. You tell me what my story is.What awaits me?Danger?Is there a man in my life?Or a candidate for the job?I'll be ready in fifteen minutes.Alexander!I've got a better idea.You have a booking in the name of Mason.Signora. That's my husband.Have a copy of today's Herald Tribune sent up to the room please.Yes. Thank you.You like it?I'd have been bored here on my own. There's more than enough room for two.I didn't ask for an extra bed...Are you all right with the sofa? If you like, I can have them bring one up?The luggage.Have you ever been to Venice before?Then we need to go out.So... when you're not on a Grand European Tour, what do you do in Rosemont, Pennsylvania?This is what I do, Frank.Oh look... a wedding. How lovely.Oh yes. I forgot.Do you think it's really over?Maybe she'll change her mind. Women do. She might give you a second chance.You haven't answered the question.For a moment there you just reminded me of somebody.He had a way of dancing around a question so eloquently that you never noticed until later that he'd completely avoided the truth. His entire life was wrapped up in deception. He told so many lies, I wouldn't believe him even if he finally did tell the truth.He wasn't.You're smarter than you look, Frank.And you're right. Here, take it.I insist. You're doing me a favor. Take it or I'll toss it in the ocean.It suits you.You should leave Venice tomorrow. It's a city for lovers Frank; no place to recover from a failed engagement.Nothing. I'm sorry....that's exactly what I'm doing, but now I want him to go...What are you waiting for? Get in.Did you miss me?I know.It's because I kissed you.Shit.Neither do you.Okay. If you want to play hero...Hold on.There's enough room.I thought Americans were optimists.How do you know--?I don't know. You're about his size. That's all.Alexander crossed a very dangerous man. He changed his appearance in order to vanish.Don't worry. I'm taking you somewhere you'll be safe.Because they did such a good job protecting you before?Trust me.Frank... Frank.Here we are.Sorry.Making sure no one sabotaged the gas lines.He goes Marlin fishing. You catch the Barracudas by accident.And she left you for a cook?Mmmmm! That's decadent.I'm glad I decided to come back for you, Frank Taylor.I'm not a criminal.Okay, I'm a criminal.I didn't mean for things to turn out like this. I always lived by a certain code. But then... I broke it.He's the most interesting man I've ever known. When I first met him, I wasn't expecting that. He took me by surprise.If I'd been prepared, I might not have loved him. But I wasn't. So I did.Regret what?What are you doing?You thought what? That I saw you on the train and my heart stopped? That all my life I've been waiting for a math teacher from the Midwest to sweep me off my feet?I picked you because of your height. Do you understand?Yes... there was nothing there today. Is... is it you? Alexa--Do we really need another \"recipe?\"That's because you leave everything up to me.I'm fine by the way, in case you were concerned about me.You have a talent for saying the right thing. You always did.Wait--Frank... I have to go.Don't go out. All you need is here. In four or five days everything will be resolved...It will all be over. I'll give you the all clear and you can go back to your life. This will be a great adventure you can look back on.Never.Good-bye, Frank.Get back inside.It doesn't matter. I love him.None of this is your business anymore. Now get back inside Frank!Mi dispiace, Signor.I don't know what you're talking about. Please go, I'd like to have a quiet coffee.Cameriere! No caffe for signor!Do you want to be dead?Frank, you have no idea what you're sticking your nose into.Wonderful. Another macho idiot. Conto, per favore!I'm leaving Frank.It's really a shame you've scared him off--The two of you make a nice couple.Frank!Have you got him?Have you got him?It's your own fault. We never should have endangered a civilian. You should have put an agent into place.He didn't spot me.What makes you think he didn't?Come in.It's okay. Come over here. I need your help.I'm sorry Frank.How do I look?When will you go home?I told him to make sure you were safe until this was over.What about me?My job.Alexander?Fine, thank you.He loses track of time easily.That's not Alexander Pearce.He is NOT Alexander Pearce!Oh Frank... I'm so sorry.Ackerman!Ackerman!!I did well to choose you on the train...He never showed up.Why?No we won't. There's nothing to talk about. I don't work for you anymore.You really think they'll just give up?What about Demidov's money?", "clean_line": "oui ow think going need help zipper stuck afraid matter quickly thanks cara dining car lovely thank ill decided holiday orient express honeymoon ask waiter set place like tell awful sorry frank wouldn touch loyal read spy novels mysterious woman train tell story awaits danger man life candidate job ll ready minutes alexander ve got better idea booking mason signora husband copy today herald tribune sent room yes thank like bored room ask extra bed right sofa like bring luggage venice need grand european tour rosemont pennsylvania frank oh look wedding lovely oh yes forgot think maybe ll change mind women second chance haven answered question moment reminded somebody way dancing question eloquently noticed later completely avoided truth entire life wrapped deception told lies wouldn believe finally tell truth wasn smarter look frank right insist favor ll toss ocean suits leave venice tomorrow city lovers frank place recover failed engagement sorry exactly want waiting miss know kissed shit okay want play hero hold room thought americans optimists know know size alexander crossed dangerous man changed appearance order vanish worry taking ll safe good job protecting trust frank frank sorry making sure sabotaged gas lines goes marlin fishing catch barracudas accident left cook mmmmm decadent glad decided come frank taylor criminal okay criminal mean things turn like lived certain code broke interesting man ve known met wasn expecting took surprise prepared loved wasn regret thought saw train heart stopped life ve waiting math teacher midwest sweep feet picked height understand yes today alexa need recipe leave fine way case concerned talent saying right thing wait frank need days resolved ll clear life great adventure look good bye frank inside matter love business anymore inside frank mi dispiace signor know talking like quiet coffee cameriere caffe signor want dead frank idea sticking nose wonderful macho idiot conto favore leaving frank shame ve scared nice couple frank got got fault endangered civilian agent place spot makes think come okay come need help sorry frank look home told sure safe job alexander fine thank loses track time easily alexander pearce alexander pearce oh frank sorry ackerman ackerman choose train showed won talk work anymore think ll demidov money"}, "FRANK": {"raw_line": "Sorry! Excuse me. Pardone moi.Hmm?I'm afraid of hurting you.I'm... sorry.Maybe I should let you do this--My name is Frank.Pardon me? Oh, no. We're not actually--What? No.Just nervous. I don't like travelling.I'm on my honeymoon.She's in Pennsylvania.You're sure you want to hear this?Two weeks ago she left me. For the owner of a pizza parlor.No travel insurance. No refund on the tickets. So... here I am. On my honeymoon.I really loved that pizza too. \"Bala Pizza\" if you're ever in Rosemont.Thanks.What takes you to Venice?Okay... you'd be a diplomatic attach\u00e9 or... let's see... a girl from East Germany whose father's been kidnapped by Soviet agents. They're blackmailing you into stealing... probably a microchip. There's usually a microchip involved.Trouble, certainly.No doubt. You'll probably be shot at in less than two chapters.Maybe.I was afraid I'd missed you. I wanted to ask where you're staying in Venice... I'm supposed to catch a shuttle to my hotel but I thought maybe--What's not to like?I can see that.No, no, no. The sofa's fine. Perfect in fact.I'll get it.I've put my things in the other bathroom.I'm a teacher. High school math. And you? What do you do?You're good at it.I'm not really into weddings at this particular moment in my life...Hmm?I suppose that's a possibility. That's what I tell my statistics class anyway; life is a game of chance. Endless possibilities and permutations. You just have to calculate the odds.Well... I'd like to think that love is a question of destiny, not chance...He doesn't sound like much of a friend.So why are you wearing his watch?What? No, I can't. This thing must be worth a fortune--I'll wear it until you regain your senses.What?I could get used to this.What... what did I do?When she...?Thank you.Goddamn it! I'm a fucking tourist!Shit...Excuse me...The officers told me to wait here. I've been sitting here for over two hours...Somebody tried to kill me.You think I'm crazy but it's all true.I have absolutely no idea.They came to the room. They pretended to be room service.I didn't \"scopata\" anybody!In America the cops catch the crooks, not the victim.No.I met her yesterday.I didn't take her. She took me.Not usually.No.I think that's possible.She didn't give me one.Um... thanks. Where are we going?I'd really rather just go--Hello?That's a relief.I'd like to be on a flight home tomorrow morning.I wish.Wrong floor.A little.Um... you may not believe this but there are some people trying to kill me--Do you know why?That guy has nothing to do with this.There's not enough room!We won't make it!Do I look that much like Alexander Pearce?The watch.You don't know what your own boyfriend looks like?Great.We should go to the police.And I thought I wouldn't get to do any sight-seeing.Whoa!What are you doing?He goes Barracuda fishing?With these ingredients, it's not hard.You know something? Food tastes better after you've been shot at.Can I ask you a question.What's it like? Being a criminal?You carry a gun, you consort with people being chased by killers... I hate to break it to you, but--For Alexander Pearce?What's he like?I don't regret it, you know.Kissing you.I thought...Resolved?When will I see you again?Is he worth it?You're going to risk everything for him. Would he do the same for you?He doesn't deserve it.Time for Alexander and me to meet face to face.Caffe, per favore?With milk!Not particularly, but I'm tired of being afraid. I've been running around like a frightened mouse long enough and I've decided I'm finished.When I first saw the name I got scared: \"Alexander Pearce.\" He even sounds like some super cool master criminal with Russian enemies and the beautiful girlfriend... he probably works out. He might own a pizza shop on the side for all I know.These are disgusting.Probably not. But I'm doing it anyway. Alexander Pearce nearly got me killed. It was his idea, right?He told you to pick out some random sap on the train to take a bullet for him, didn't he?Well I'm not playing the role anymore. I'm going to confront him. He's supposed to meet you here, isn't he? I'm going to tell him exactly what I think of him.What's the lure, Cara? Obviously not his character. Is it the money? The luxury? What's any of that worth if you're getting shot at and you could go to jail?He's smooth, right? He probably has mistresses in every European city, too.What the hell?Is this him?You hide out poolside and send your girlfriend and a total stranger to face the murderers who are after you? Not much of a tough guy, are you?Where I come from, we don't treat women like that!Cara!It's borrowed.Unfortunately.Police... better than the alternative I suppose.Who's watching from behind there?I haven't needed it lately.You're in for a disappointment. I'm not Alexander Pearce.Since when?How...?You?Cara...You saw those men try to kill me and you didn't intervene?I want to speak with somebody at the American Embassy. I'm going to tell them that you and your undercover officer knowingly and recklessly endangered the life of an American citizen! Let's see what my government has to say about that!Then I'll go to the press. I'll tell the entire story to the New York Times.Why not?In my case, they don't come along at all.If she's so smart, how did she get caught up with Pearce?Then why are you still using her?You think she'll turn him in this time?It's not just me, is it?If you're all around his house, will he show up?I'm sorry.Ackerman told me everything.There's no apology necessary.Like the most beautiful woman on earth.Ackerman asked me to stay with the surveillance team in case the thugs who came after me at the Danieli show up. I'm the only one who can identify them.Did you tell him to keep an eye on me?You shouldn't worry about me. What about you?What are you going to do?You all read the same newspaper.I look forward to meeting him.Who's that?Nothing to be sorry for.Are you all right?You didn't get to arrest Alexander Pearce...You're wrong. I'm here.It's me. I'm here.You said I'd told so many lies, you wouldn't believe me even if I did tell the truth... This was the only way to convince you. The truth is that I love you. All that matters is that you believe me.It seems you did, Mr. Ackerman.It's good to see you too.The Americans have their money. I left it all for them.Well...
