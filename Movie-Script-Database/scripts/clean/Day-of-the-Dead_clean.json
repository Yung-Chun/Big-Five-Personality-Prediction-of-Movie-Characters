{"Day-of-the-Dead": {"RHODES": {"raw_line": "You'll get used to this, Tyler. It's the only way. They don't bite the hand that feeds.GET THAT THING AWAY FROM THE OTHERS! BRING IT HERE!We have visitors. Let's go men.Hah! If only the rest of you ladies would obey orders the way they do.THAT'S IT, YOU WORM-EATEN SLIME ! YOU FOUL- SMELLING, PUSS-FACED MAGGOTS! I TOLD YOU I'D FIND YOU REAL ACTION, DIDN'T I? YOU CORRUPTION! YOU FILTH! YOU'RE LEARNING!SPREAD OUT, MEN! OPEN FIRE!Take his weapon, Tyler.Take his gun, ass hole. He still has the strength to pull a trigger.Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.They can handle it, Tyler. You've been buckin' for a shit detail lately so here's one you're gonna love. We've got two dead. Cut the heads off and get the bodies underground to the refrigerators. Fast. It's a hot day.Tyler. Just our men. Not him.His head stays where it is. He and I never really had the chance to get acquainted. When he comes back...I'll get another shot at it... Ha ha ha ha...And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!Then why did you come here?How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?Where are you going, Tyler?No time for that. I'll take care of them.I said, I'll take care of them. Just leave them there. Go help with the rest of the gear.WHO FIRED THAT SHOT? WHO FIRED THAT SHOT?Goddammit, somebody's gonna tell me who fired that shot or I'll have every last one of you chopped up for feed!!!Step up here, Tyler.You fired that shot, didn't you?Let me see your weapon.It's been fired.It may be that none of these chicken-shits will talk while the whole troop is present...but I know some of these men well. I'm sure that a few private conversations will tell me what I already know. You may have earned yourself some time in the Stalag, Tyler. Cut him down. That's another head for you to chop off. Leave it with the others. Take the rest of his body down to the freezers. Move it, shit hill.Take it, friend. Take it. It's a present. From me to you.Just remember who gives you favours.Well, Bub. I've heard about you. Miss Henried's pride and joy.Surly sonofabitch. I want to make friends, Bub. Friends. I have one more goodie in my sack here.Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?No wonder they're so....hungry.Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh.And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.Oh, I have no doubt.Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.Maybe you'll change your mind when it starts getting too lonely for you.I'm not entirely without influence myself, Miss Science. I had your roommate assigned...by Gasparilla... to my platoon. What's his name? Tyler? Yes. Toby Tyler.I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.No, Miss Science. You're the one who needs to do some thinking.Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...I don't want to take up a lot of time with this. Mr Tyler shot a prisoner against orders. There are eyewitnesses. I've reprimanded Tyler and I've had him sent outside. It's as simple as that.The prisoner was dying, sir. Tyler acted out of a sense of mercy. I don't believe Tyler to be dangerous, General. He just needs...discipline. Two or three months outside will teach him...discipline.REVEILLE! REVEILLE! RISE AND SHINE!We found two white Bees in the jungle with their heads chopped open. I want to know who's going outside the compound. I want to know how they're going out. I want to know why they're going out. Until I get these answers...each morning...some of you will die.Don't be alarmed. We're impregnable. Stay where you are. Nothing will happen to any of you. You're safe here. Men.THIS WAY. OVER HERE! SHOOT! SHOOT THEM! SHOOT TO KILL! IN THE HEAD!HENRIED! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?STOP THEM! SHOOT!After them then! I want them stopped! That woman is dangerous!SHOOT IT OPEN!", "clean_line": "ll tyler way bite hand feeds thing away bring visitors let men hah rest ladies obey orders way worm eaten slime foul smelling puss faced maggots told real action corruption filth learning spread men open weapon tyler gun ass hole strength pull trigger maybe ll little talk maybe help string handle tyler ve buckin shit lately gonna love ve got dead cut heads bodies underground refrigerators fast hot day tyler men head stays chance acquainted comes ll shot ha ha ha ha ll come death ll come hanging wanting eat needing eat human flesh hate thought ultimate sin fools isn hanging days mad food crazed lust worse ll bargain island believe rebel headquarters mainland headquarters rebel tell ll let hang forever forever come know island know come going tyler time ll care said ll care leave help rest gear fired shot fired shot goddammit somebody gonna tell fired shot ll chopped feed step tyler fired shot let weapon fired chicken shits talk troop present know men sure private conversations tell know earned time stalag tyler cut head chop leave rest body freezers shit hill friend present remember gives favours bub ve heard miss henried pride joy surly sonofabitch want friends bub friends goodie sack come come miss science ve seen worse god damned atrocities worse wonder hungry dead brains intact revive brutes feeling admit ve requested cremation burial archaic tradition ridiculous spacing problem small island like purpose decapitation preserve food possible purpose feeding beasts fact taught clean garbage gun convenient benefit primary goal primary goal supper fed behave hungry revert animals saw satisfied miss henried want human flesh prepared steps necessary run away planet miss science run away island heh heh builds bomb says hope ll actually oh doubt ah yes noble gasparilla favour lately understand assigned roommate choice rest pick names hat maybe ll change mind starts getting lonely entirely influence miss science roommate assigned gasparilla platoon tyler yes toby tyler unfortunate little run today fact mr tyler big trouble authorities miss science needs thinking sir matter state versus private tyler want want lot time mr tyler shot prisoner orders eyewitnesses ve reprimanded tyler ve sent outside simple prisoner dying sir tyler acted sense mercy believe tyler dangerous general needs discipline months outside teach discipline reveille reveille rise shine white bees jungle heads chopped open want know going outside compound want know going want know going answers morning die alarmed impregnable stay happen safe men way shoot shoot shoot kill head henried going stop shoot want stopped woman dangerous shoot open"}, "JOHN": {"raw_line": "It's alright. It's alright. Don't be afraid. We're friends.There are soldiers near here. Guards. I'll take my hand away if you won't scream.Right. We better get away from that Bee. He might have friends.Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They could sting, sister. We know you came up against 'em. We been watchin' you since you landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was spotted it could....well, it could be the end of everything.Give that to me. Get behind me. Stay behind me.I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.We found nine entrances to the Cave so far, and we ain't got the whole thing near charted yet. That's what we was doin' out here today. Huntin' for entrances.How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.What is it if it ain't a curse?That sounds like a curse to me.I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.You think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail?We didn't see the exact spot but we know about where you landed. But we ain't ready to take you there. Not yet. You see...we need guns, too.Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.We don't need her guns that bad. Billy boy.We'll split up. Billy, you go with Spider. Just an hour or two tonight, that's all. Rhodes might have extra guards on after all the commotion. We'll meet up at number six and go back home together.The fences make a safe pathway to Stalag Seventeen. That's where we live. That's where you gonna live, too. Hell's half acre. It's not a nice place. Them boys there is prisoners. What's their punishment? They sent out to the Stalag for a few weeks. That's punishment enough.This is home, darlin'. Home for us that don't make the grade. Us that ain't...good enough to live inside The Cave. We grow a little food, do a little light manufacturin'...like these here vests, we make these for the massers. We live in our own filth, with bugs and snakes and disease and jungle fever...all the time waitin' to become breakfast for the Bees.It's a tunnel. It's a couple hundred yards. Just keep goin' 'til you reach the end. I'll be right behind you.It's OK. It's OK, Doc. She's with us.This here's the hospital. That's Diesel over there, the big guy. This here's Lukey and that's Doc Logan who's about to cut your tonsils out.This here's all the weapons we got. That's why your fancy automatic looks so good to us. We gotta stick it over here with the others for now. They catch us with any kind o' weapon and its death without even askin' your name.Ammunition. You got ammunition in your pack there? I hope you do or the gun ain't worth much.We better just hide the whole pack, darlin'. That stuff is just shoutin' out that it come from the mainland. The shit we get is all C.D. rations. Aspirins and crackers from 1958.Let's go. You look like you could use some shut eye. Me too. We can all get acquainted tomorrow.This just ain't your day, is it, darlin' Sarah.Three more minutes. Then you can sleep. You gotta stay with it for three more minutes.They supply us with disinfectant and dope. Sex, drugs and rock-and-roll. What more could anyone ask for? Most around here ain't interested in changin' their lives. The folks you met...me and them and a couple others is the whole rebel army. Nobody else gives a shit...and they're afraid o' Rhodes.You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.This is your hotel. I'm not gonna stay here with you but I'll always be close. You gonna hafta take care o' yourself like you said you was able to do.Some may notice that you're new. Just deny it. You'll get away with it. Nobody really looks at each other around here. Go on in. Get some sleep.He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.Ain't no place safe.The hospital?Maybe.Give him a chance.What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels?We got a boat.I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?I'm gonna trust him, Diesel. He already knows who we are and we ain't got a bunch o' time to mess around with Rhodes shootin' up the joint every mornin'.Can't walk around here with these. Let's just leave 'em here 'til we ready ta use 'em.You're sick, Doc. You been sick for a while now. Too sick to be workin' with us on this raid.You've helped us enough, providin' cover, hidin' us out. Let the rest of us handle the physical stuff. It's too much for you.We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.Datura.Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.Come on. Let's go.Just stand guard for now. Spell us after a while. Can't breathe this grass too long or somebody hafta carry you home.Well...if ya think about it...we as ready as we ever gonna be. How was they carryin' the nitro, Lukey?What you wanna do?What is it?Damn you, island. Damn you ta Hell and worse!Satan ain't sent this man back. Not yet, anyway. So we all hopin' that maybe he's up there with you, Lord. This might be the first decent soul we been able ta offer ya in quite a few years. That's a fact. We just gonna... pray, Lord. We gonna pray that what seems ta be happenin' here...is really happenin'...and I'm gonna take the chance and speak these words that I ain't been able ta speak for so long...Just me. I'll take the next shift.Forever, darlin'. Forever.
