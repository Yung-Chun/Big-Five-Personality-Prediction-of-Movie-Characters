That's twelve cows sired by Berkut!I'm very anxious to see you. I need your advice.Hard at what exactly?Oh--paperwork.Yes. I'm in love. I've come back to propose. Have you guessed who she is?I decided it was impossible. Kitty is of the heavens, an angel, and I am of the earth-- but then I thought and thought, and . . . there's no life for me without her! . . . Do I have a chance?Anything! What?Right. Anything else?Forgive me, but I find that incomprehen- sible . . . As though I'd leave this restaurant and steal a roll from a baker's shop.But I'm talking about love, and you're talk- ing about . . . your appetite.Who? No. Why?Who is he?It's what I wanted.Understand that for me, tonight is a ques- tion of life and death.Dolly said that? I've always thought your Dolly's a gem.I'll come back.I'm too early.Princess Ekaterina! Delighted, delighted!Kitty . . . you look . . . you look--I don't know. It depends on you.What I mean to say--I came with only one purpose--I want to--will you be my wife?I'm sorry--sorry--wrong moment--but will you?Yes. It was impossible.Yes.How do you know?Count Vronsky?It's Kostya.Nothing. I came to see you.Good evening, miss . . . madame . . .I don't want anything.A colonel in the Third Department. They're watching you.Nothing.No.No.Yes. I damn well should!Nikolai, you have to see a doctor. Then come and stay with me at Pokrovskoe till you get your health back.If you . . . or go abroad to a spa. I'll send you more if that's what you . . .What about the brotherhood of brothers?Will you go to confession?God will forgive you.God forgive us then, for committing the act of love.\"Not according to my deserts, O Lord, but according to thy mercy\"--that's a fine prayer. But I'm full of doubt. Sometimes I even doubt that God exists.I don't know. One day science will tell us.Well, I won't go to confession.What would you like?I thought that had been done.Of Babylon? No.All right, go on, then. Have you stopped stealing bread rolls?So, nothing new to tell me. How is--how are the Shcherbatskys?I . . . Is she engaged now?Oh yes, as if I had time in the summer! And I've got extra land this year at Kashin for the haymaking.Especially not then. I humiliated myself once.Her heart told her no. Did you come to shoot snipe or criticize me?For you, getting married is . . . a social engage- ment. Not for me. For me, it's the condition of personal happiness and living the right way. I'll never again be carried away by passion. I renounce it. I'll have to find another way . . .How many mowers is it, Theodore?The men don't like me for it.It settles me.When I'm mowing, I don't ask myself why I'm here.My father owned you, Theodore. My grand- father owned your father. Owned you like chattels, to be bought and sold. Was that by the grace of God?It's true I was looking at him.They look happier than I've ever been. Is it living simply that I'm looking for?I need your advice . . .Am I late? Who is here?Since you saw me, but I saw you not so long ago.You were driving to Ergoshovo . . . I was at Kashin for the haymaking.I'm so glad to see you. You're just the same.Months and months ago!No. I haven't.I would. But not for my neighbour's wife.An impure love is not love, to me. To admire another man's wife is a pleasant thing, but sensual desire indulged for its own sake is greed, a kind of gluttony, and a misuse of something sacred which is given to us so that we may choose the one person with whom to fulfill our humanness. Otherwise we might as well be cattle.Since we last met, there is something I have often wanted to ask you.This.I know what it says.Then. But now?Can You.Can you Forgive. And Forget.I never stopped . . .. . . no, I'll go to her and tell her it's not too late to stop this business! Better now than when we're married and she realises she doesn't love me!How can she? I mean, look at me! Suppose she's only marrying me to get married? Suppose she's still in love with Vronsky?I have to talk to Kitty.You can't love me. Think it over! Let people say what they like!Yes. If you don't love me.Do you? Well, I love you!This is Agafia, and Vasili, the steward . . . My wife, Ekaterina Alexandrovna Levin.And that was Kuzma. Come inside!Is it all right?Sit down a minute.A moment.It's me, Konstantin.Where did you go? I asked for you every- where, when I was getting married.Yes. My wife . . . You can't stay now.Yes--yes . . . She's going.Did the doctor see her?I will nurse him with Agafia . . . The woman will find somewhere in the village. You won't see her. She knows it's impossible for you to meet her. It is a torment to me that I have brought you under the same roofThank you, Father . . . and how much . . . ?I'll be buying in feed before winter's over.My soul! What's that? I know what my belly is.

He loves you, Dolly. You and the children are everything to him.That was shameful, disgraceful. But it was not love. It was the animal in man, not the soul. Stiva's remorse is from the soul.I know you are suffering. But, Dolly, you must tell me . . . is there enough love left in your heart . . . enough to forgive him?My poor lamb. So you'd rather accept your fate . . .Do you love him, Dolly?You love him, and he loves you, but you can't forgive, so your lives must continue like this for ever, with both of you wretched.Grisha, don't pull so hard, you're getting it all in a tangle--and look for another G forWell, that's the end of that.Oh . . .

Oh--Dolly and Stiva . . . yes, I think so . . .Sssh . . .I'm writing to Dolly . . . and to Kitty.What new Statute?No one mentioned it.Yes . . . Yes, the Metropolitan Bishop of St. Petersburg.The last one was to meet a missionary, the one before was for a lecture on the union of the Greek and Roman churches. I'm sorry--I know you're fond of her. Come on, or we'll be late.I'm expected at the Tverskoys.Yes. In fact, I think I won't go to Betsy's.I would prefer to try a cigarette.Thank you.I'll try another one sometime.Just as I was thinking your manners have improved since Moscow. You behaved badly, very badly.Give me a cup of tea.This must stop. You make me feel as if I were guilty of something.I want you to go to Moscow and beg Kitty to forgive you.If you have any thought for me, you will give me back my peace.What?No, I'm staying. Send the carriage back for me.No. I don't want you to go.Waiting up? How unlike you!What about? It's late. Where's Annushka?Well, if you want to talk, but we should go to bed.Warn me? It's really rather late . . .I am not a committee.

This.Alexei, what is it?I'm pregnant.How can we, Alexei?Do you think my husband will make you a present of me?Leave him and be your mistress?I would never see my son again. The laws are made by husbands and fathers.Unhappiness? I'm like a starving beggar who has been given food.I unhappy? No, this is my happiness!Alexei!--you got away at last.

I can't bear you, I'm afraid of you, I hate you. Do what you like to me.Are you hurt?I told him I'm your mistress.He thinks I can give you up and go on living.Tell me your latest find for your library.Both true.Alexei . . . I can't . . . I'm sorry . . . But I'm his wife now. I am having his child.No!--no. I will not live like this!Waiting hour after hour while you're drink- ing champagne with naked actresses-- don't think I don't know!--Lisa Merkalova still calls on me.Yes--I'm sorry--it's my demon, I can't help it.Did I? Well, I am! But don't worry! It won't be for long, I'll soon be out of your way--soon!No, it's true. I was told it in a dream.Yes, and I'm only going to die having your baby.Tell me it is, tell me it is. You love me. Only me.He was late. Serves him right. And you. Why do you call him my husband? He isn't my husband--he's a clock, a wooden doll--Do you think of my honour when you're sharing whores with your Hindoo!I'll be glad to die, before you start to hate me!Put your hand there. There! Did you feel him move!I wanted to see him because . . .What are you . . . ?Alexei . . . please . . . leave me Serozha . . . !Why doesn't he come? He is kind. He will forgive me.I want Alexei! Why doesn't he come? Give me some water. No, I mustn't, it's not good for my little girl. Or let her have a nurse. Yes--don't bring her here, because Alexei is coming and it will hurt him to see her.Oh, what nonsense. I must be asleep, that's what it is. You think he won't forgive me but you don't know him. No one knows him except me. I'm not afraid of him now.I'm afraid of death, though.Oh, my dear. Don't look at me like that. I am not the one you think. I'm afraid of her. She fell in love with another man. I'm the real one. But I'm dying now, then she'll be dead, too. Poor man! Let him come in. Alexis! Alexis!Take your hands away from your face. Look at my husband. He's a saint! Take his hand. Alexei--take his hands away.Forgive him, too. Thank God, thank God . . .So you came.If I had died as I wanted, you would be free of your troubles at last.No--stay.Princess Betsy came to tell me . . .I have just said so, so there's no need to repeat it.Yes, and I decided.That we agree, so perhaps we can stop talk- ing about it.Yes, can you please please please stop crack- ing your knuckles. I'm a bad woman. But I can't breathe. Your kindness which I can't repay, and your FORGIVENESS--But I didn't die and now I have to live with it! If only you would have gone on hating me.Not to say goodbye.Not to say goodbye.You forget something. Count Vronsky and I love each other.All I know is that I sent him away and it's as if I'd shot myself through the heart!I would die for him, but I won't live like this for him. When he knows about love, he'll forgive me.No . . . I can't . . .I'm here to see Sergei Alexeyich.I have brought something for Sergei Alexeyich.I've come to see Sergei Alexeyich.Oh, my dear little boy.I won't cry. It's time for you to get dressed. And I almost forgot your present, look . . . open it . . .Darling Kutik, Maman can't stay . . .Yes, I must, and you must love Papa-- he's better than I am. When you're grown-up . . .Where's Anya?I'm not sleeping.To where? To whom?I didn't know what happened to you.Does it take all day for you to meet your brother? Does he need you more than I do?How good you are to come. You're the very first person to call on me since our return.I received a note from Princess Betsy asking me if I'd call on her between six-thirty and eight. Or was it seven?Alas, between six-thirty and seven is just when I'm unable to see her!I would love to be there if I could get a box.I see why . . . Alexei is so fond of you.Annushka!A bath. I'll come in and choose a dress.I'm not ashamed of who I am or what I've done: are you ashamed for me? Why do you keep a room at the hotel? Aren't we together? Have you changed towards me?If that's the case, I don't know why you aren't coming with me.You're afraid. Well, I'm not.Stay put.Thank you, how very . . .. . . you had an excellent night! Does your mother want you to marry the widow or the child?Don't make a joke of it. If you loved me, you would have locked me in to stop me going.Go to bed.I won't sleep.I understand.Kitty . . . ? Oh, tell her how pleased I am . . . !Yes . . . love! Don't you disapprove of me for what I've done?What time is it? Is Anya up?I'm all right. It's all right. Get them to bring up all our trunks and travel cases. We've been here long enough.I had an inspiration. Why do we have to wait here? Why can't we wait in the coun- try? I don't want to hear any more about a divorce, or think about it.If I bore you here, I'll bore you in the country.I can't be ready by tomorrow.If you like.That's twenty minutes away in the train-- you could go to see her tomorrow--or was it that you wanted to spend Sunday with Princess Sorokina?In that case, let's not bother. I'll leave on Sunday or not at all.It's absurd to you because you have no understanding for my life here.You've stopped loving me. You've given up everything for me, and it's turned you against me. Why lie about it?Because I've been living off your love and there's none left, so this is over! Finished.I'm sorry. I don't mind when we go.You should leave me.Why?Is that your way of telling me you'll be at your mother's with that simpering little princess?Well, I know what that means.Thank you, but if I'm not fit to dine in soci- ety, I won't eat with the band. Who was the telegram from?I told you I don't care about the divorce, so why hide the telegram? What else do you hide from me?Why do you care about the divorce? What has it got to do with us loving each other?You're perfectly free to marry anyone your mother wants.Yes, we are, and, by the way, compared to your mother I'm the Virgin Mary.So it's the child.Unpack everything. We're not going.When Count Vronsky comes back, tell him . . . I don't want to be disturbed.Count Vronsky . . . ?Oh, Annushka . . . I should have died.

I will not return to this house until divorce has put you into the street. Meanwhile my son will be sent to live with my eldest sister.Do you think I would let you have my son?

And what if the lover had killed the husband?-- would that have preserved the wife's honour too?Love? Thou shall not covet thy neighbour's wife.I tried to save her. She chose ruin.I do not wish to forgive. I am not a cruel man. I have never hated anyone. But I hate her with all my soul for all the wrong she has done me.Die, then.How is your mistress?So . . . she is well?I am free of them.But you must leave now. I promise to send for you if she asks for you. I don't know what happened. I forgive you. I forgive Anna. My soul is filled with joy. I will remain with her and look after her for ever.Come now, come now . . .Who is here?Please excuse me.You look feverish.I agree with you. As he is going away, there is no need for Count Vronsky to come here.But it is for you to decide.Then I am very glad that--Of course. Is there anything I can do for you?You begged me for my forgiveness.But then--what? What? What do you want?I can't hear.You would be lost. Irretrievably lost. You would have no position. And worse if we divorce. You would be the guilty party. That means you cannot legally remarry. Your union with Count Vronsky would be illegitimate, and so would your daughter who now has the protection of my name. And that is what you want! It would be a sin to help you destroy yourself.And this love sanctifies a criminal folly?I see. And Serozha . . . ?Then I must choose the smaller sin.

You stayed longer in St. Petersburg.I can't think what you're referring to, Maman.Excuse me for not recognizing you before.That must have been very boring for you.Keep your people inside until this has been cleared up.Wait for me, Maman.No.No. You look . . . as lovely as ever, Princess Kitty.Dance with me.I dare say, but if I'm not to dance with you, I'm getting out of this operetta and going home.Can I be of service to you?You know why. I have to be where you are. I can't not.I'll never forget a single thing about you, not a word, not a gesture--Take the luggage home.Did you have a good night?I'll announce myself.You're at home where you are, Baroness.No.Ah.It's my crockery.Provincial.Thank you, sir.Tashkent? But . . . I would like to stay in Peter, sir, if you don't mind.I had to see my Commanding Officer.I'm afraid I am becoming ridiculous.I'm losing hope.And how is Tuskevich?No--you're right. She won't come. I'm going home.Turn round!Ices are being served.Courage!When?Where?And who was responsible for that?Were you glad to see me or not?What do you want me to do?No, that's not what you want. Moscow? I can do better than that. Tonight I refused a posting to Tashkent. I can change my mind, and you'll never see me again.I have no peace to give. There can be no peace for us--only misery or the greatest happiness. You are my whole life now.Do you want me to go to Tashkent?So I'll go to Tashkent.Anna . . . Anna . . . how can I not remem- ber? You're my happiness.You should care. You're not supposed to.Everybody. Doctors.Anyway, someone might be watching.I'm not. I'm blessed.Yes.No.Yes.Yes.Yes.Yes.This much.Yes.Yes.Yes.Yes.That was Maman interfering.So they talk about me. I'm leaving, Sasha.Come on, I'll introduce you.Makhotin's Gladiator is favourite, sixteen hands--Frou-Frou looks dainty beside him, but she's got heart. Haven't you, my darling?Anna.I couldn't bear not to see you before the race.What were you thinking about?Tell me.Ah . . . My love.Well, love was never a game to us. Here's an end to living in corners, existing day to day on lies. Yes, now we can be together.Tell Karenin everything.Leave him.Yes. Run away.What, then? I'll never forgive myself for your unhappiness.What's happened?No, you cannot.He's some kind of prince at home. Exhaust- ing. Where is Tuskevitch this evening?Captain Makhotin . . .I must leave you. I'm on duty tonight.I am expected.It's punishment enough that I'm on escort duty, without . . .You wrote that you were ill.Stop.There, it was only a bad dream.That's all nonsense!Your note said your husband would be out.But it was awkward . . . a matter of your honour. You made an agreement.Your demon again!Anna . . .She's dying. Please let me stay.Whatever you think of me, please believe me, I love her--I could not have done other- wise than what I . . . what I did.I would like you to go, Maman.In Petersburg? I'm finished here.You look like a boy. But so pale. We'll go south . . . to the sea air and sunshine . . .Why are you in the dark?Yashvin is going to call . . . you remember him. Are you going out?What's the matter?But I told you yesterday . . . My brother . . .What's happened?Well . . . Alexander agreed to everything. Mother's house in Moscow will go to him, and the country estate will be our new home . . . as soon as the divorce . . . Karenin hasn't answered your letter yet?You know you can't go to the theatre?For heaven's sake--Anna--I implore you--don't you know . . . ?It's because I love you and care about you.That would make it worse.You'll come up to see us afterwards . . . ?Will you call on Anna?For God's sake, Anna isn't a criminal!Captain Makhotin . . .As far as I'm concerned, she's my wife.We're going to Moscow, and then to my place in the country.But for a day or two, Anna will be at home, at my flat.Then, I'll say goodbye now.Either one.Yes, it was my fault.I know how to make you sleep.Good! I'm bored here. When should we go?I didn't say you bore me. Moscow bores me. When should we go? . . . Tomorrow?The day after, then.No, wait. That's Sunday. I have to see Maman.Please don't spoil everything. I can't see Maman tomorrow because she won't have read the papers she has to sign. Oh, and then there's the bank . . . But we can leave on Tuesday.That's absurd!Anna . . . Anna . . .Stop. I put off our departure for a day or two, and you tell me I don't love you.I'll telegraph Maman. We'll go on Sunday. I'll do anything you want.I don't want to. I love you.You can't ask why about love.So--will you be all packed? I'll be out today making the arrangements.No. I'll be with my lawyers. I'm waiting for some documents. Then I'm having dinner to say goodbye to old comrades.My God, this is unendurable.I can invite them here if you like.I didn't show it to you, because Stiva keeps telegraphing what we already know. Kare- nin promises nothing, but will consider . . .I hide nothing from you.Until we're married, our daughter is legally Karenin's. I care about it because we need to be free to marry.But we aren't talking about--Is there anything you wish to say to me?She brought papers from Maman.Anna?", "clean_line": "yes princess kitty long like yesterday hello bad luck like art train yes course oblonsky sister karenina stayed longer st petersburg think referring maman excuse recognizing boring people inside cleared wait maman look lovely princess kitty dance dare dance getting operetta going home service know ll forget single thing word gesture luggage home good night ll announce home baroness ah crockery provincial thank sir tashkent like stay peter sir mind commanding officer afraid ridiculous losing hope tuskevich right won come going home turn round ices served courage responsible glad want want moscow better tonight refused posting tashkent change mind ll peace peace misery greatest happiness life want tashkent ll tashkent anna anna remem ber happiness care supposed everybody doctors watching blessed yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes maman interfering talk leaving sasha come ll introduce makhotin gladiator favourite sixteen hands frou frou looks dainty got heart haven darling anna couldn bear race thinking tell ah love love game end living corners existing day day lies yes tell karenin leave yes run away ll forgive unhappiness happened kind prince home exhaust ing tuskevitch evening captain makhotin leave duty tonight expected punishment escort duty wrote ill stop bad dream nonsense note said husband awkward matter honour agreement demon anna dying let stay think believe love wise like maman petersburg finished look like boy pale ll south sea air sunshine dark yashvin going remember going matter told yesterday brother happened alexander agreed mother house moscow country estate new home soon divorce karenin hasn answered letter know theatre heaven sake anna implore know love care worse ll come anna god sake anna isn criminal captain makhotin far concerned wife going moscow place country day anna home flat ll goodbye yes fault know sleep good bored bore moscow bores tomorrow day wait sunday maman spoil maman tomorrow won read papers sign oh bank leave tuesday absurd anna anna stop departure day tell love ll telegraph maman ll sunday ll want want love ask love packed ll today making arrangements ll lawyers waiting documents having dinner goodbye old comrades god unendurable invite like stiva keeps telegraphing know kare nin promises consider hide married daughter legally karenin care need free marry aren talking wish brought papers maman anna"}}}
