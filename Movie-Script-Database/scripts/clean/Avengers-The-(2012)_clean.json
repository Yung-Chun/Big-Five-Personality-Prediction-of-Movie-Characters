{"Avengers-The-(2012)": {"NICK FURY": {"raw_line": "How bad is it?NASA didn't authorize Selvig to test phase.What are the energy levels now?How long to get everyone out?Do better.We should tell them to go back to sleep?I need you to make sure that PHASE 2 prototypes are shipped out.Until such time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every piece of PHASE 2 on a truck and gone.Talk to me, doctor. DR. ERIK SELVIG emerges from behind the CMS machine, concerned. The Tesseract is glowing unusually brighter and flare rings shoot out at random.Is there anything we know for certain?Is that supposed to be funny?How soon until you pull the plug?We've prepared for this, doctor. Harnessing energy from space.That can be harmful. Where's Barton?Agent Barton, report. BARTON rappels down from the catwalk. Walks up to Fury. They both walk around the facility in a discreet manner.I gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things.Are you seeing anything that might set this thing off?At this end?Sir, please put down the spear! Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING LIGHT TOWARDS THEM. BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss Loki's fired shot. ALL HELL BREAKS. Machine gun fire is shot at Loki, but the bullets bounce off him like a boss. Loki jumps high from the platform and ATTACKS those firing at him. In the blink of an eye, Loki takes down several guards with his KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter. He stops and waits to see who will attack him next. Honestly, the whole lab has almost gone to shit. Barton tries to stand up. Loki quickly walks towards him. Barton raises his gun, but Loki grabs Barton's hand.We have no quarrel with your people.You planning to step on us?Free from what?Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think you mean the other thing. From the vacuum chamber ceiling, Tesseract's energy cloud RAPIDLY builds into what may be an implosion.Like The Pharaohs of Odin.Hill, do you copy?! Loki and Barton SHARPLY look at Agent Hill.Barton is...He's got the Tesseract! Track it down! The energy is really brewing a fucking shit storm from the vacuum chamber ceiling.The Tesseract is with the hostile force. I have men down. Hill?Sound the general call. I want every living soul not working rescue looking for that brief case.Coulson, get back to base. This is a LEVEL SEVEN. As of right now, we are at war. A beat.You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight? Did you feel an overabundance of control?Not Asgard. Loki.Our intelligence says, Thor is not a hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't depend on him to help. It's up to us.PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We need a response team.This isn't about The Avengers.I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We need a response team. These people maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need.No, it's won by soldiers.Trouble sleeping?Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world. Steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the tape off his hands. He sits down.We've made some mistakes along the way. Some very recently.I am.Trying to save it. Fury hands Steve a file on the Tesseract, along with other files on HYDRA'S projects.Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That's something the world sorely needs.He's called Loki. He's not from around here. There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment. Steve turns and picks up a punching bag. Starts walking out of the gym.Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?Good. Let's vanish.Gentlemen. Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement about never being surprised again. Fury walks over Banner and extends his hand. Banner, reluctantly shakes it.Doctor, thank you for coming.Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear.How many are there?Agent Romanoff, would you show Dr.Banner to his laboratory, please. Natasha nods and walks off, leading Banner down the hall.Captain, you're up. Steve nods. Leaves.Said anything?Just get him here. We're low on time. With Loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, Tony and Steve watch from a distance, whispering.In case it's unclear. You try to escape. You so much as scratch that glass. Fury presses a button which OPENS UP a HATCH underneath Loki's cell. Loki peers as much as he can from the glass. Without seeing, the sounds of GUSTING WIND would make man shit his pants. Not a god, though.Thirty thousand feet, straight down in a steel trap. You get how that works?! Fury closes the hatch. Points at Loki.Ant. Then points at the button which would drop Loki into the steel trap.Boot.Built for something a lot stronger than you.How desperate am I? You threaten my world with war. You steal a force you can't hope to control.You talk about peace and you kill `cause it's fun. You have made me very desperate. You might not be glad that you did.I don't know about that, but it is powered by the cube. And I'd like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys.War hasn't started yet.A lot of guys think that, until the pain stops.I'm asking. What are you prepared to do?Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here? Thor doesn't answer.You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean that we're...Because of him.Last year earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that leveled a small town. We learned that not only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned.But you're not the only people out there, are you? And, you're not the only threat. The world's filling up with people who can't be matched, they can't be controlled.You forced our hand. We had to come up with something.Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark?Excuse me, did WE come to YOUR planet and blow stuff up?You need to step away.Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr.Banner back to his...The cell was just in case...Hill?!Stark! You copy that?!Coulson! Initiate official lock down in the detention section then get to the armory! Move out!Bring the carrier inwards and head south. Take us to the water.Is the sun coming up?!Then put it on the left! Get us over water! One more turbine goes down and we drop.We need a full evac on the lower hangar bay. Agent Hill nods. She leaves to exit out, but a SLIDING GRENADE appears.Get his attention.They are not getting through here, so what the hell... Suddenly, Barton LOOSES an arrow down to the bridge and EXPLODES critical spots. Barton releases a multi-tipped arrow towards Fury, but instead hits his command desk, right above a USBIt's Barton. He took out our systems. He's headed for the detention level. Does anybody copy?Stark, we're losing altitude.Just stay awake. EYES ON ME!Not an option.Agent Coulson is down. Agent Hill is being treated for a gash on her head, listens on her headset, standing up.They're here.They called it.These were in Phil Coulson's jacket. Guess he never did get you to sign them. Fury throws Coulson's CAPTAIN AMERICA TRADING CARDS on the table towards Steve. Steve picks them up, STAINED WITH BLOOD.We're dead in the air up here. Our communications, location of the cube, Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you. Lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that coming.Well, it's an old fashioned notion.Agent Hill?They needed the push. A LOUD NOISE SCREECHES. Fury looks out to see IRON MAN flying off as well as the QUINJET.They found it. Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do. I want eyes on everything.I recognize the council has made a decision, but given that it's a stupid ass decision, I've elected to ignore it.That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman. Until I'm certain my team can't hold it, I will not order a nuclear strike against a civilian population.I send that bird out, we already have. Fury shuts off his viewscreen.Stark, you hearing me? We have a missile headed straight for the city.Three minutes, at best. Stay low and wipe out the missile.I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts. I'd say they've earned a leave of absence.The Tesseract is where it belongs: out of our reach.I didn't make it. I just didn't argue with the god that did.Oh, I think he will be.They surely are. And the whole world knows it.

What's wrong?Is he like them? The LITTLE GIRL holds out all the money she has in the world.Should have got paid up front, Banner. Natasha then appears from behind the curtains. Banner turns around, quietly.Avoiding stress isn't the secret.You brought me to the edge of the city, smart. I uh... assume the whole place is surrounded?And your actress buddy, is she a spy too? Do they start that young?Who are you?Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff? Because that's not gonna work out for everyone.SHIELD. How did they find me?Why?What if I said no?And what if the... other guy says no?I don't always get what I want.Well, those I actively try to avoid.What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it?So Fury isn't after the monster?And he tells you everything?He needs me in a cage?I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted to see what you'd do. Why don't we do this the easy way, where you don't use that, and the other guy doesn't make a mess? Okay? Natasha... Natasha, still wary, doesn't lower her gun. She lowers her gun and speaks into her earpiece.Just you and me? Natasha fidgets now that she exposed her guard down.Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be coming.Is that the only word on me?Must be strange for you, all of this.Really? They wanted me in a submerged pressurized metal container? They both move closer to the edge of the HELICARRIER. FOUR HUGEThanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how long am I staying?Where are you with that? Nick Fury turns to Agent Coulson to explain, while Natasha Romanoff eyes an image of Clint Barton on a computer screen.You have to narrow the field. How many spectrometers do you have access to?Call every lab you know, tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work?He really grows on you, doesn't he?So he's building another portal. That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.He's an astrophysicist.I don't think we should be focusing on Loki. That guy's brain is a bag full of cats, you could smell crazy on him.Iridium, what did they need the Iridium for?He's got to heat the cube to a hundredand twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier.Well, if he could do that he could achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet.Let's play some. As Banner and Tony walk out, the GALAGA PLAYER turns ever so discreetly, watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to playing.The gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig's reports on the Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to process.All I packed was a tooth brush.Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I kind of broke...Harlem.No, it's alright. I wouldn't have come aboard if I couldn't handle pointy things.Uh...I just wanna finish my work here and...'A warm light for all mankind, Loki's jab at Fury about the cube.Well, I think that was meant for you. Even if Barton didn't post that all over the news.It's powered by Stark Reactors, self- sustaining energy source. That building will run itself for what, a year?So, why didn't SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project? I mean, what are they doing in the energy business in the first place?Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you? Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier, shakes it off.The guy's not wrong about Loki. He does have the jump on us.And I'll read all about it.Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor. I'm exposed, like a nerve. It's a nightmare.But you can control it.It's different. Banner tries to read the computer screen, but Tony slides the data aside with his finger so the two can see face-to-face.So you're saying that the Hulk... the other guy... saved my life?That's nice. It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?You might not like that.We are. The model's locked and we're sweeping for the signature now. When we get a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile.Did you know about this?I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed.And you've been doing what exactly?Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy. I'd like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.It's his M.O., isn't it? I mean, what are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a chemical mixture that makes chaos. We're... we're a time-bomb.Yeah, this is a tee...Where? You rented my room.In case you needed to kill me, but you can't! I know! I tried!You wanna know my secret, Agent Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay calm? BLACK WIDOW and Fury have their hands down to grab their guns.Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my little party trick after all.Oh, my God!Your life? His voice has the change in it -- the bitter amusement is morphing to a growled threat. Another explosion rocks the carrier -- and he turns to look at her, transforming just as the lights go out.Lucky.You saw?Thank you.

It's fine.I don't like it.I don't remember it being ever that easy. This guy packs a wallop.What?Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.What's the matter? Scared of a little lightning?Loki's gonna drag this out. So, Thor, what's his play?I wanna know why Loki let us take him. He's not leading an army from here.Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?Is that what just happened? Tony and Banner shake hands. A glimmer in their eyes shines as the mutual respect for each other shows.Let's start with that stick of his. It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.I do! I understood that reference. Tony rolls his eyes, while Cap looks proud of himself.Is everything a joke to you?Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny. No offense, doctor.And you need to focus on the problem, Mr. Stark.You think Fury's hiding something?Doctor? A beat.I heard it.The Stark Tower? That big ugly ...building in New York?I'm sorry, did you say...?Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around?I think Loki's trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war, and if don't stay focused, he'll succeed. We have orders, we should follow them.Just find the cube. Steve walks out of the lab. Still torn apart by the possibility, he walks away, towards the HULL of the ship.PHASE 2 is SHIELD uses the cube to make weapons.I was wrong, director. The world hasn't changed a bit. At that moment, Thor and Natasha walk into the lab. Natasha keeps her eyes right on Banner. Banner looks at her, PISSED.Like you controlled the cube?A higher form?You know damn well why! Back off!Big man in a suit of armor. Take that off, what are you?I know guys with none of that worth ten of you. Yeah, I've seen the footage.The only thing you really fight for is yourself. You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.Put on the suit, let's go a few rounds. Thor laughs at them.Doctor Banner... put down the scepter.Look, all of us...You're not going alone!Put on the suit, let's find out.Put on the suit. At that moment Banner who's looking at the monitor notices something about the Tesseract.Put on the suit!I need a minute here!Was he married?I'm sorry. He seemed like a good man.Why? For believing?He was doing his job.Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.Is this the first time you've lost a soldier?Neither am I! He's got the same blood on his hands as Loki does. Right now we've got to put that aside and get this done. Now Loki needs a power source, if we can put together a list...That's not the point.To tear us apart.Right, I caught his act at Stuttengard.Time to go.I'll tell you on the way.

Pepper pours herself and Tony a glass of champagne.I'll tell you what.

Uh, his first name is Agent.Which is why he can't stay.I don't like being handed things.Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday.The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought. And I didn't even qualify.Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self- obsessed, don't play well with others.Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute? Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own databases.You know, I thought we were having a moment.How did you notice? Why is he Phil?This is, uh... Tony EXPANDS his arms and different profiles appear in holographic form floating in the air in front of Tony and Pepper.This. Screens appear of CAPTAIN AMERICA IN ACTION, the HULK ROARING ASTomorrow.Well, what if I didn't?Yeah.Square deal. It's the last date. Pepper kisses him.What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. What's your thing? Pilates?It's like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple things, you know, doing time as a Capsicle. Steve looks at Tony, finally meeting his ego match.Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you.

Until then, stay out of my way... tourist. The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick move, Thor pulls Mj\u00f6lnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear across into a tree.Okay. From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement. Thor raises his hand. Mj\u00f6lnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the hammer, summoning a ray of energy. IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and knocks Thor into a tree. Right back at you, bitch! Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls Mj\u00f6lnir to his hand, raises it to the skies and pulls in LIGHTING and THUNDER! Thor points the hammer at IRON MAN and the outpouring of bolts lighting increases in intensity. IRON MAN falls back.How about that? IRON MAN FIRES AWAY FROM HIS HAND BOOSTERS, pushing Thor to his knees. Like two gunslingers ready to draw, both Thor and IRON MAN fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up.It's a stabilizing agent. (walks in with Coulson; toWell, that sounds exhausting. The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source. A high energy density, something to kick start the cube.Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes, the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the only one who did the reading?Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect.Finally, someone who speaks English.It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner. You're work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster.Shall we play, doctor?If we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops.Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension. No surprises. Suddenly, Tony pokes Banner with a MINIATURE ELECTRICAL PROD. Steve walks in on them, pissed at Tony.Nothing?You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?Funny things are.You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to strut.You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us and why now? Why not before? What isn't he telling us? I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets. It's bugging him too, isn't it?That's just the prototype. I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.I should probably look into that once my decryption programmer finishes breaking into all of SHIELD's secure files.Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge.

Historically, not possible.Following is not really my style.Of the people in this room, which one is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B. not of use?That's the guy my dad never shut up about? Wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit.It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm gonna be there when it does.Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us.You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. This stops it. This little circle of light. It's part of me now, not just armor. It's a... terrible privilege.Because I learned how.Hey, I've read all about your accident. That much gamma exposure should have killed you.You just might.Uh...kind of been wondering the same thing about you.And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss. What is PHASE 2? Suddenly, Steve drops a HYDRA ASSAULT RIFLE on the table causing Fury, Banner and Tony to turn around. Cap looks pissed.I'm sorry, Nick. Tony moves the computer screen towards Fury which shows plans ofWhat were you lying?Nuclear deterrent. `Cause that always calms everything right down.Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me.Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.I think I would just cut the wire.A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle!Got it. Banner puts down the scepter and walks over to the computer.I can get there faster.You gonna stop me?I'm not afraid to hit an old man.Yep! Steve helps Tony up and out of the lab. Fury sits up, clutching his ribs. He puts on his EARPIECE.I'm on it!Find engine three. I'll meet you there. Cap peels off as Tony approaches a tech room. Inside, Tony's IRON MAN suit stands waiting, lit above in all its glory.Good. See what we got. Tony flies in his IRON MAN suit and gets close to the damaged engine.I gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online before I can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris.Even if I clear the rotors, this thing won't re-engage without a jump. I'm gonna have to get in there and push.Then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag...See that red lever? It'll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out. Stand by it, wait for my word. CAPTAIN AMERICA looks over at the other side where he was. He sees the red lever and JUMPS towards it.Cap, I need the lever!Lever. Now! Tony lets go of the rotors. They spin by themselves. Tony is then caught in one. He is now fucked. IRON MAN slips into the rotors, getting chewed up.No. There was a uh...cellist, I think.He was an idiot.For taking on Loki alone.He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have...WE ARE NOT SOLDIERS! I am not marching to Fury's fife!(looking at the blood stainedThat is the point. That's Loki's point. He hit us all right where we live. Why?He had to conquer his greed, but he knows he has to take us out to win, right? That's what he wants. He wants to beat us and he wants to be seen doing it. He wants an audience.Yeah. That's just a preview, this is opening night. Loki's a full-tilt diva. He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants a monument built in the skies with his name plastered...Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.Skip the spinning rims. We're on the clock. TONY lands his SUIT and goes through the gauntlet and unsuits him. LOKI looks up at him, smiling. They proceed to walk into the penthouse.Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten you.Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage. You've got the blue stick of destiny. Would you like a drink?No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You sure? I'm having one.But, let's do a head count here. Your brother, the demi-God; a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you've managed to piss off every single one of them.Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they'll come for you. From underneath the bar table, Tony pulls on COLANTOTTE BRACELETS, a honing device.We have a HULK.You're missing the point. There's no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you. Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it.Well, performance issues. You know? In anger, Loki GRABS Tony by the throat and FLINGS him across the room.Jarvis. Anytime now. Loki grabs Tony by the throat again.Right. Army. IRON MAN flies up towards the portal. From his shoulders, a miniature multiple rocket launcher, pops out and FIRES. Like the JERICHO MISSILE, several targets are taken down unlike no missile. It's useless. THOUSANDS OF CHITAURI FLY OUT. IRON MAN flies towards the city.Fine. Let's keep them occupied. IRON MAN heads back to the portal.I'm seeing, still working on believing. Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?Just keep me posted. Jarvis, find me a soft spot. IRON MAN quietly flies behind and parallel with the CHITAURIThen tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you. IRON MAN comes out from behind a building. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN follows, impatiently.Nice call. What else you got?And he didn't invite me?I got a nuke coming in, it's gonna blow in less than a minute. And I know just where to put it.What the hell? What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me?Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job, guys. Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day. Have you ever tried shawarma? There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here.
