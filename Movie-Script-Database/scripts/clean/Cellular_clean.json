{"Cellular": {"JESSICA": {"raw_line": "Buenas dias, Rosario.Where is who?Wh... what do you want? Unsettlingly, the Kidnapper says nothing, staring at her. Jessica tries to remain calm under his angry gaze... Then suddenly, the Kidnapper turns and exits the room. Jessica breathes a sigh of relief...but it catches in her throat as he returns ten seconds later -- with a BASEBALL BAT. Grim as death, he stalks toward her --No, wait.. And reaching.her, he hauls back and SWINGS --Wha... what the hell is happening?! The attic's suffocating silence is the only answer she gets.Wait! Don't hang up! Ryan puts the phone back to his ear.There's not much time! I need you to go to the police. My name is Jessica Martin; I've been kidnapped!Please. I know what you're thinking, but it's real! I'm in an attic somewhere. I think they're going to kill me! You need to-No! You don't understand! Suddenly, the cellphone BLIPS twice in Ryan's ear. He pulls it away and looks at its faceplate.Goddamn it, listen to me! The phone I'm on...it's shattered! There's no dialer! I've been clicking wires together for hours trying to get someone, anyone, and you 're the only connection I was able to make! If you hang up, I may not get anyone else.Wait! Don't hang up! DON'T HANG UP!! But -- CLICK! Ryan flashes over to the next call.--an you hear me?!No! Don't! They're going to kill me! They're going to kill me!! A silent beat. A calculated look in her eyes... RYAN pulls the phone from his ear and is about to hang up...when he hears the one sound that stops all men cold. On the other end, Jessica begins to CRY.Please... I just need help. But Ryan won't be manipulated.These men!!!-- Jessica stops herself short, quieting the rising hysteria in her voice before it gives her away. She glances anxiously at the attic door, then continues, more in control.These men killed my housekeeper. My dog. You have to help me. Ryan bristles at being saddled with anything, much less this.Please...you're my only hope. What's your name? That catches Ryan off-guard. He stalls, not wanting to make this personal.--Please, just tell me your name! Ryan glances around the street, his eyes falling on a stone fountain outside a French Restaurant.Johnny... What if it was your mother who was calling for help? How would you feel?Goddamn it, how difficult is it to hand this phone off to the police?! I'll pay you!Five thousand dollars.No, wait! WAIT!! Even if there's a eighty percent chance I'm lying, you nave a one in five chance to make five grand f9r a lousy twenty minutes of your life. Haven't you ever bet on a horse or bought a Lottery ticket? I'm talking one-in-five odds, twenty minutes. Ryan slaps the radio off.Please. . .Oh thank God! You've got to help me. My name's Jessica Martin and I've been kidnapped. This morning five men broke into my home in Brentwood and kidnapped-- Mooney strains to hear. His eyes go wide and he quickly jots notes on a pad. Mooney's eyes shift as three TWEAKERS, wide eyed and sweating profusely, are led inside by their ARRESTING OFFICERS.Hello? Officer? Hello?!Oh my God...What? I don't- The masked leader SLAPS HER SHARPLY across the face! Jessica wants to collapse to the ground, but remains sitting TO KEEP THE PHONE HIDDEN behind her. The Leader bends down and yells right in her face.At work! Why, what do you want--? SLAP!!! This one's even nastier than the first.Please, he should be at work! That's all I know. The Leader nods, then turns away. Jessica exhales with relief that he didn't spot the phone. But her victory is short-lived as:Johnny!!My son -- Suddenly, as Ryan reaches the first landing -- STATIC starts breaking up the call.Oh my God! What's happening?!No, don't! Stop. You can't lose me--Stop! Johnny, goddamn it, stop!Johnny, what time is it?! Johnny!Johnny, listen to me. My son's school lets out at 1:45.No. There's not enough time. You have to pick him up before they--Please please stop standing there! He 's just a little boy!Go! Ryan grunts in frustration.Where are you now?!You've got to go faster, Johnny!How should I know?!I'm an obstetrician. They don't want anything from me.What--? No. He's an accountant. I make more money than he does.No! I don't know. None of this makes any sense. Jessica starts losing it completely, upsetting Ryan so much that he takes the next corner too fast and -- SKKRRASH! --How much time do we have? Ryan checks his watch. It reads: \"1:40 PM\". He enters.Ricky.Martin.He was named before the singer ever-He's eight years old. Blonde hair. Green eyes. Small for his age. He's wearing a light blue shirt and dark blue pants--I don't remember.I don't pack it! Rosario, our housekeeper does! Sometimes Craig, but... Jessica begins to sob, which causes Ryan to panic further.I wish I could give you more. Now Ryan's running. He yells into a BATHROOM.Was that the bell? Was that the bell?!He'11 go to the parents' pick-up spot. Oh God, they're going to get him!Yes? Relieved, Ryan turns and races for the front of the school.What--? No!Unless they have our Escalade. Ricky'11 think it's Rosario and hop right in! She's got a point. Ryan picks up the pace and arrives at the pick-up spot. Scans the lot.Black!4..7..wait, no...3 -- Oh my God, I don't remember!No!No--No, Johnny, you have to listen to me-- /.' But Ryan's had enough. He turns to leave --Lord of the Rings! I forgot his father bought him a Lord of the Rings lunchbox last week! Ryan's heart stops in his chest. He turns to see the Boy with the Lord or the Rings lunchbox racing down the school steps and up to one of the waiting Escalades.What's happening, Ryan?!Oh my God. There are three cars between Ryan and the Escalade.Don't lose them! If you follow them back here, you can tell the police where they're holding us!Johnny!Can't you go around it? There's an ungodly amount of opposing traffic-- But suddenly there's a break in the flow! Seizing the moment, Ryan SLAM-SH IFTS the rent-a -cop car's uni-cylinder engine into gear and starts to tear around the bus -- but has to SWERVE BACK as a SPEEDING TRASH TRUCK rounds a bend and almost creams him!What?! Did you lose him? !Oh thank God!What's happening?! Are you okay?!What?! Yo u lost--You let them get away. Ryan wants to snap at her, but guilt crushes it right out of him. He knows she's right.Look, Johnny, you've got to go back to the cops--Goddamn it, stop thinking about just yourself! You can explain everything to them later!Don't you have a charger?What's going on? Did you find one?Johnny, don't lose me!Johnny--!Yes.What's going on?!I'm here! Ryan hops out and races inside--You found a charger?Thank you for doing all this, Johnny.Good, it sounded like a porn star name. It's okay. I know. You don't have to tell me --Thank you, Ryan. But before they can say any more, suddenly--N-no... Jessica scoots away, trying to draw Greer's eyes in another direction from the phone that lies OUT IN THE OPEN....but I am going to, aren't I?What? I don't understand--? Greer winds up and BAM! Hits Jessica in the stomach, knocking the wind out of her and causing her to fall to the ground.I... I don't know what you want me to say. I swear--Wait! The bleachers behind left field at Dodger Stadium! That's where we first met.Please! Believe me. That has to be where he means. I swear to God. Then he stands, looking away for just a moment -- but long enough for Jessica to NUDGE the phone back behind the beam!Ricky!Please! Please, believe me! Ricky plays innocently -- while Hodges now COCKS his pistol.Please, he's just a child!No...no.' I swear that's all I know! Greer gives a sigh of disbelief --OKAY! ... okay... LAX Airport! There's a bar called Left Field. That's where we met. We were in college on our way to Mardi-gras.Please God, I swear that's the truth. Don't kill my son!You won't get away with this. When I didn't show up at the hospital, someone must have called the police--Do you honestly expect me to believe we're going to walk away from this alive? But Greer isn't listening to her. He strides back into the room, listening to the noise under her voice.How can I SHUT UP? You threaten to kill my child and you expect me to act like a MUTE?! If this -- Suddenly, it hits Ryan like a punch to the face. And he scrambles, trying to cover the phone.I'm here.I'm okay.Do you think I like gambling with my son's life?Don't you see, Ryan? Once they get Craig, we're all gonna die.Be realistic. Does letting us live benefit them in any way? No! The only chance he's got is if you can get to the airport and find him before they do.Ryan, please! There's no time! Just get to the airport--Look, I have no right to ask you this Ryan, but you re my family's only chance...and I am asking. Something in the way she says that last sentence, a mixture of strength and vulnerability, gets through to Ryan. And against his own will, he's swayed.Where are you now?!Twenty minutes! Oh my God, Ryan, you've got to drive faster! Please--Sorry. I just...Do you think God will forgive me?For what I've done... For giving up Craig... Ryan is moved by the emotion in her voice.I don't know. I don't know...My son and I are going to die here, Ryan. They already have us. But maybe I could've saved Craig... The truth of this has a profound effect on Ryan. And just when Jessica is about to lose herself to despair -- Ryan finds a resolve within himself even he didn't know he had.I'm..ere, but y...reaking up!Ryan?! I'm here! Her voice says she can't believe her ears. Relieved, Ryan jumps in the Cadillac XLR and tosses his phone on the passenger seat, next to a LAPTOP computer. Guns the engine and STOMPS the gas. As he passes the ruins of his rent-a-cop car, he slows just enough to open the Cadillac's door and snatch up his bag of Verizon goodies laying on the pavement -- then peels away. Practically frothing at the mouth, Simon Cowell chases after on foot, cursing as his beautiful new Cadillac disappears in the distance --I thought they... I thought I was--What?Hurry, Ryan! Just find Craig! Ryan hops out -- but stops when the car CALLS OUT TO HIM.Wait, Ryan! What about me--?! Ryan searches the car and finds the HANDSET in the armrest. As he grabs it and races after Greer into the airport, a Traffic Cop comes up to the car.\"Left Field\" is in Terminal C.He's thirty-eight. Six feet. Trim build. Thinning hair...I don't know! We have completely different schedules. I was fast aslee p-- -- A suit... He wears glasses, thick rims, like Buddy Holly or-- Bingo! The Buddy Holly glasses is what did it. Ryan sees a man in the distance hurrying in his direction -- CRAIG.What?! The Guardsman's SUPERIOR OFFICER examines it. Is it real?Ryan, you've done so much. I don't know how to repay you... An awkward, emotional pause falls between them.I will. I promise.Craig? Craig stops dead, hearing the voice. Scans the cobweb-filled room, seeing nothing -- then from the depths of the shadows, Jessica materializes looking haunted and lifeless as a ghost.No, don't hurt him! Jessica struggles and, with an annoyed shove, Greer sends her spilling into Craig. She hugs tightly against him. When Craig gets his wind back, he comes to his knees and manages to croak out--Who are they, Craig? Craig doesn't know what to say.Tell them, Craig. Tell them they have the wrong family. Tell them they've made a mistake-- But something in his eyes disagrees.What?! What is it?You hid it downtown?Wait! WAIT!! She brushes past Hodges and hugs on tight to her husband, tears flowing from her eyes. Hodges goes to pull them apart, but Greer stops him. He knows this is going to be their last time together.Pretend I'm telling you that I love you. There's an open phone line in here. You'll have help at the office, but if you give these men what they want, we're dead. Jessica kisses her husband on the lips and withdraws, leaving Craig with an utterly confused expression on his face. But before his look can betray him--Ryan?! They're going to Fegan Securities, 4th and Figuroa.Wait, we -- --ve to think! What -- --re we going to do?Ryan... ? Ryan, please answer me I But Ryan just sits there. Afraid to move. Terrified to discuss Craig.You have to talk to me! Ryan, please you have to talk to me--.' The sweat from his hands causes the tiniest SLIP -- and as he catches himself, there is a soft metallic BOOOONG from the stressed metal. Unable to ignore her pleas any longer, Ryan carefully pulls the cellphone from his pocket and presses it to his ear. Desperate to console her, Ryan -- BANG!! The TARPAPER ROLL flies down the chute. Ryan looks up to see it angrily launching itself right at him! He has to let go of the walls to avoid being hit. He presses himself to one side but -- WHAM!! The bloodthirsty roll bashes his wrist -- and he DROPSRyan?! OH MY GOD, RYAN?! RYAN--?!Don't hurt me, and I'll do anything... Anything.. . There is a promise in what Jessica offers that Deason responds to. His fist FLASHES toward her throat, making her flinch. But rather than hitting her, he wraps his meaty fingers around her throat, almost daring her to stop him. Jessica trembles, but that is all, and just as Deason begins to enjoy his work, Jessica JABS at his face, but he predicted as much and easily moves to deflect it -- SNICKK! -- she flicks her wrist up and SLICES the underside of his upper arm. Deason flinches a little bit, like a bee sting, then laughs as he notices the tiny SHARD in her hand--Brachial artery. Pumps up to 30 liters of blood per minute...and there's only five liters in the human body. Three seconds later, Deason crumbles...and Jessica leaves the attic.Baby! Are you okay?!Get down! Get down! And Jessica DUCKS OUT OF VIEW just as the--Baby, listen to me. I want you to get away from this window. I want you to go to the other side of the room as far away from the door as you can --Honey, I'm getting you out of there!I'm only gonna be gone a second, and then we're gonna go home, but you have to do this first. It's gonna be loud, but don't be scared, okay? Now go find somewhere safe like I told you.Baby, please! It's okay now. We're gonna go home! Ricky, please! Somehow, the kid digs deep and finds the courage to run to the Escalade, where his mother scoops him up into the cab just as-- The kitchen door bursts open and Greer's team spills out into the yard. They spot her instantly.Come on! COME ON!! Jessica rocks the car forward, and back. Forward, and back. And just as it finally comes loose -- KRRRAAASHHH!! The window next to Jessica's head EXPLODES in a shower of tempered glass, shocking us. Two arms snake in and wrap around Jessica's neck. Greer. But Jessica STOMPS ON THE GAS, hoping the big car will pull her free. It doesn't. As the Escalade surges away across the lawn, Greer's vice-like grip holds, PULLING JESSICA OUT the broken window and -- THUMP! -- to the guest house debris below. As Jessica watches in horror:Nobody!Ricky run! Find help! Ricky's paralyzed with fear.Tell me why I shouldn't kill you. For the first time, Greer actually looks frightened. Recognizing the homicidal look in her eyes, he SPUTTERS, but nothing comes out. Ryan, weak and pale with blood loss, looks up at his guardian angel.I... I have to.Thank you for keeping your promise. As the cops move in and drag Greer to his feet, Ryan calls out to him.Craig's very weak, but the doctors say it looks promising. He's probably going to have to walk with a cane, but that's the worst of it... I'm just thankful. Chloe senses that Jessica and Ryan might need a moment alone.I can't believe I almost lost everything that means... I don't know how I can ever thank you.", "clean_line": "buenas dias rosario wh want unsettlingly kidnapper says staring jessica tries remain calm angry gaze suddenly kidnapper turns exits room jessica

He gets an EXTENDED PLAY and the screen flashes \"NEW RECORD.\" Nearby, a KID watching the game nods.Get that? Ryan turns around to see Chad has shoved the cellphone down the front of his tattered shorts. And he's freeballing it.C'mon Chad, I gotta put my mouth on that. Holding a cup of soda between his teeth, Chad pulls the cellphone out of his pants and hits \"SEND\".Watch it dude, I gotta return that thing in seven days.Nah, whenever I return it, I just list off why the phone sucks and they give me a new model. Figure by the tenth time I'll have to go somewhere else. Ryan's car finally CRASHES in a wall of flames. Game Over.Waterproof. But as soon as Ryan covertly CLIMBS ONTO THE RAIL, his left leg starts trembling like crazy.This is stupid. I could get killed. Pick another dare. Chad lowers the phone, irritated.Screw it then. In one... Two... Two and a half--Got any more? I'm here to help.What's in 'em? Chloe opens the box. Hands him a \"Heal The Bay\" pamphlet.Cool, you're handing these out during the concert?Hell yeah. I'm all about \"Heal the Bay. \" His eyes ricochet off the pamphlet in his hand.Me an Chad do the monthly cleanup thing, of course... An awesome wing-man, Chad appears over Chloe's shoulder, pretending to read a pamphlet, but really holding it up so Ryan can see it. Piece of cake, now.We've collected water samples with the Stream Team, raised money on the Promenade... I'm surprised I haven't seen you. He offers his hand.Ryan. She takes it.You ever go up to Santa Barbara? My dad used to take me there allthe time. Their pier is amazing, clear water, huge crabs everywhere, oysters right there on the rocks, starfish... Hard to believe it's the same ocean sometimes. He's managed to win her back.Sounds like a plan. There's a moment... Then --I'll do it for you... if you want.Sure. How much is the bill?Do you promise not to go anywhere?Okay, I won't be long.Dude, does Santa Barbara have a harbor or a pier?Dex, wassup? You won't believe the hotties I just met at the pier. Smoking. You wanna meet them? Yeah? Well don't get too excited 'cause I need my money. Ryan stops at a red light.Bullshit, you're not going anywhere, I'm pulling up right now. Some AMBULANCES SPEED BY, SIRENS BLARING. It's deafening. Ryan lays on the horn. When the light changes, Ryan peels away angrily.What? Yeah, you better be. And I need your shower, I'm talkin' code red stankage- The CELLPHONE begins to CRACKLE with STATIC just as Ryan drives under an OVERPASS. Suddenly -- The car ahead of him STOPS in the middle of the street. Ryan notices too late and has to jam on the brakes. The car skids, he SCREAMS... and comes to a stop an inch before hitting the other car's bumper. He lifts the phone receiver to his ear but the call is WASHEDDex? You still there...? And as has happened to all of us, he loses the call.Damn.Sorry, got cut off. Hey -- what's my Caller ID say? But there's no voice on the other end, only shuffling sounds.Yo Dex...?Hello...? Jessica's hands go suddenly still, then -- WHOOM! -- her head slams down INTO FRAME on top of the crushed earpiece, a desperate hope filling her eyes.Whatever. Signing off- -- and is just about to hit END CALL when he hears a tiny female voice on the other end.Hello?Oh really? Kidnapped, huh?Awfully polite kidnappers to give you a phone... Jessica's voice TREMBLES uncontrollably. Desperate, fearful and frustrated.If you were really in trouble, you would've called the cops, not me. Now I've got a real call on the other line--Hmm. Sucks to be you. Try crank yanking someone else. Late.Dex?Awesome, I can totally use a credit card. Tell me more.-Shucks, now's really not a good time, but why don't I get your number and get back to you later.That's the office number?Why don't you give me your number instead. That way I can call you when you're having dinner with your family. A beat.Damn skippy. And that's when he notices the message flashing on the phone's faceplate: CALL ON HOLD. Ryan clicks the FLASH button to pick it up...and Jessica is still there.You still there? You're getting kinda creepy, lady. See ya.Oh, it's like that, huh? Nice with the fake tears, lady...You need acting lessons. Now go take your meds and bug someone else.No, actually( I don't. Not with a hot chick waiting for me at the pier.Why, you writing a book--?Uh...Johnny. Johnny Fountain.Well, I'd be damn impressed, considering she's dead.How much?Sure you will. I'm hanging up now.What do you want me to do?I'm here.Excuse me, officer -- But Mooney ignores him in favor of the three cops that suddenly need arrest sheets signed.Hey, I've got an emergency here -- Just then, CREWCUT OFFICER shoulders his way through with a cuffed CRACKHEAD TRANNIE in tow. The Trannie's wrists ache.Come on, man! I've got some lady on the phone here who says she's been kidnapped!Seriously, a lady was murdered!Take the phone and find out moron! A COP snickers somewhere.Where?What? What is it?Lady, what's going on?! Jessica drops the phone. Has just enough time to shove it behind her before -- SLAM! -- the attic door swings open and two of the masked kidnappers stride in. When they reach her, they stand silently, trying to unnerve her.Oh shit... Panicking, Ryan turns and walks, then jogs, then all-out runs for the station stairwell.I know. I'm trying to get help.It's just static. I'm running upstairs to the detectives. Hold on, I might lose you for a sec--Wait, we're almost there.Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?! Ryan looks at himself, standing on the stairs like an idiot.Jesus! I'm almost there! Ryan checks the SIGNAL STRENGTH INDICATOR on the phone. There's only one bar left. Defiantly, Ryan takes a step UP...and the bar DISAPPEARS. He quickly hops BACK DOWN.Crap!You're shitting me.Who? Oh -- one-twenty.Good, then if I get a cop-- Ryan exits the stairwell to find Mooney -- but Mooney's not there anymore! There's some NEW GUY -- and he's SWAMPED!Pick him up? Hell no, lady! I ain't goin' nowhere else-- Ryan tries to get the NEW GUY's attention, in a dream.But I'm in a police station!I just got off the 405.You've gotta chill! You're stressing the crap out of me! Where the hell is a cop hiding in a speed trap when you need one? Ryan takes a hard right, tires squealing. Pushing it against his better judgment.What do these guys want, anyway?What do you do?So your husband's like, uber-rich?Could they've mistaken you for someone else?Oh...SHIT!! Ryan SLAMS on the brakes and SWERVES to avoid hitting a group of workers -- and OBLITERATES THE BRONCO'S PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR against another BARRIER -- Ryan cringes with every muscle! And the mirror ricochets off the ground -- and smashes through the windshield of a recently waxed Acura Legend!...Ain't that a bitch. As the heavily-muscled workers start running to beat the shit out of him, Ryan floors the gas, sending a shower of wet asphalt all over the cursing workers as he peels away, CRASHING through a FINAL BARRIER. More cautiously, Ryan rounds the next corner and --There's the school. Ryan's right. Just ahead, we see:Okay, I'm here.Five minutes. What's your kid's name?Ricky what?Ricky Martin? You named your kid Ricky Martin?! Why didn't you tattoo \"kick me\" on his ass while you were at it?Forget it. What does he look like?They're all wearing blue shirts and pants! Ryan turns down a hallway and we see that he's right. It's filled with IDENTICALLY-UNIFORMED LITTLE BOYS. As a TIMID BLONDE BOY passes in front of him, Ryan grabs him and wheels him around.Ricky Martin? The Boy's eyes get huge. He tries to pull away.No, kid, it's okay! I didn't mean to--Does he have anything else? A jacket? A backpack? What's his lunch box look like?You don't remember your own kid's lunch box?!Ricky Martin, where are you!? None of the Stepford kids respond.Ricky Martin?I'm looking for a little blond boy-- --No, no! Not like that!Oh shit...Yes. RICKY! RICKY MARTIN!! Ryan wades through the sea of uniforms.No--! Ryan tugs his arm free and races to the phone. The LCD display GLASS is cracked into a SPIDERWEB.Jessica? You still there?!No one's gonna get your kid! He's not slow, is he?Then he won't go anywhere with strangers.What color?Of course it is. PAN AROUND to see what Ryan sees -- three black Cadillac Escalades.There's three of them. What's your plate?Like you don't remember the lunch box? Or anything else about your kid-- Oh, man. This is a prank, isn't it?Bullshit! Oh, you're good lady. Your friends too. Getting me to scream out 'Ricky Martin' at a boys school. Damn, you really nailed me.I'm done being your entertainment for the day. I'm going back to the pier while I still have a chance -- -- and passes right by a blonde-haired, green-eyed, EIGHT- YEAR-OLD BOY carrying a Lord of the Rings lunchbox. Ryan hesitates and is about to stop the kid...but then decides \"screw it\", and keeps on hoofing. Ryan rounds a corner to leave -- and is confronted by the Gym Teacher and a RENT-A-COP SECURITY GUARD.Stalking?! No, I can explain-- The Rent-a-Cop mumbles into his walkie.Hey, HEY RENT-A-DUDE--!! Hang on a sec! This is a huuuge misunderstanding-- A little RENT-A-COP CAR pulls up in the driveway below. The Security Guard starts forcibly leading Ryan toward it, but as he gets close--Oh shit! You just see that?! Losing control of Ryan, the Rent-a-Cop calls to his partner in the car.Goddamn it, that little kid was just kidnapped!! Do something!!Don't worry, I can fix this.It's okay, I can see them ahead.Okay.Damn! There's this stupid bus-- Ryan jags left and right, catching glimpses around the bus of the Escalade still ahead.Come on! But the bus doesn't pull over. Ryan tries flashing the security car's CLEAR BUBBLE LIGHTS on the roof, but who the hell would pull over for that? The bus sure doesn't.Jesus.'Goddamn it!No, I just almost got killed, is all.Thank God? That's nice. Just then, the bus signals that it's pulling over.Hey, here we go!No, No! just give me a second-- As Jessica goes off, Ryan tosses the phone down and focuses on finding the Escalade. He floors the rent-a-cop car, engine CLATTERING, to the intersection. Ryan franticly searches in every direction, but the Escalade is nowhere to be seen. He floors it.Jesus! Where the hell did they go? Dreading talking to Jessica, Ryan slowly picks up the receiver.Jessica, I--Are you high?! I just jacked a car!What now? Ryan pulls the phone away from his ear and checks it out.Great! Now the battery's dying.It's in my car! Hold on. SFX: BEEP-BEEP! The battery indicator has lost another bar. Ryan fumbles around in the armrest. Finds nothing. Opens the glovebox and -- a snub-nosed .38 SPECIAL tumbles out.Jesus -- !Not exactly... SFX: BEEP-BEEP!! Jessica starts growing afraid.Well what the hell do you expect me to do?! Just then, Ryan rounds a corner -- and sees traffic GRIDLOCKED to a halt ahead. He tries to maneuver around it, but is almost immediately boxed in.I know, Jessica! The phone starts a STEADY BEEPING now, dying imminent. And traffic isn't going anywhere. Ryan looks around desperately. Nothing. No emergency lane. No shoulder. Just a long drop down a HILL to a strip mall below-- STRIP MALL?! Ryan scans it and does a double-take on one of the store's signs: \"VERIZON WIRELESS\". Traffic inches forward. Now he sees an OFF-RAMP a quarter- mile ahead -- but at this rate, it'll take forever to make it there.You know that money you promised me?I'm giving myself a raise.mmmrrmph mrm mrmph! Ryan is bounced around like a corn kernel in a popper until the car hits a jutting rock and -- WHOOOOM! -- goes up on two wheels. It looks like it's going to roll but gravity bringsShit! Ryan scrabbles for the phone -- but gives it up when he bounces over a rise and sees A BILLBOARD DEAD AHEAD!Jessica?! Can you hear me?!Excuse me--Hey! Hey! I've got an emergency here --Damn it, will you listen to me?! I've got a life and death call on this phone and my battery's dying! Do you have a charger?Bu t-- !Help, I --Aw, screw this... -- Ryan pulls the rent-a-cop's big .38 SPECIAL from his pocket and BLOWS THE SMILEY FACE DISPENSER TO DUST!Oh look! Now serving thirty eight special!Whew! That was so no bueno!Among other things... Ryan glances at piles of phone gear he's appropriated from Verizon. EARBUD MIKES. MANUALS. RECEPTION BOOSTERS.Yeah, look, about that... My-name isn't really Johnny Fountain.It's Ryan. Ryan Ackerman. I'm a bar-back. I'm twenty-two, and just a little freaked out right now. Jessica is moved with emotion by his honesty.Oh shit!Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus!!Goddamn it, listen to her! She doesn't know!!Oh shit! Where's mute?!Jessica...? Answer me, goddamn it I Soon, his voice pierces the suffocating gloom around her and she crawls desperately over to it.You all right?! I thought they--What are you doing? Why'd you lie to them?I can't tell. You seem pretty good at it --You can't know that for sure.Wait, wait--!It's suicide. They'll kill me!Lady, I've jacked two cars, been accused of being a child molester, obliterated a car dealership, and busted three caps in a Verizon store. -- Don't tell me I'm not trying! Jessica tries another tack.I'll get the phone to your husband, but that's gotta be it, okay?!I'll be at the airport in twenty minu --Jessica, this car has a sewing machine for an engine! I can't go any faster!Jessica... ? There's an emotional beat, then--What do you mean--?Jessica, they have your kid. You had no choice.1 know. I heard what they were doing to you over there. You held out for as long as you could.Jessica, listen to me. I promise you, I'm not going to let that happen. I could care less about your money. I'm risking my life cause I know I'm gonna get you and your family out of this. You hear what I'm sayin'?Jessica? Are you still there?Listen dude, this woman's in serious --Jessica, don't hang up! You hear me?! Whatever happens --Jessica?! Jessica?! As Ryan goes mental, a CAR PASSES HIM on the opp9site side of the road -- a new Cadillac XLR convertible! Inside is an appropriately asshole-ish looking guy. He could only be the British Asshole.Gotcha. Ryan pulls a HARROWING 180 DEGREE TURN, barely missing an oncoming car by inches. He RACES up to the Cadillac, which has a VANITY PLATE that reads, \"IDOL MKR.\" Ryan looks through the window at --Give me that phone... or I shoot your car! Cowell is prepared to comply -- but suddenly behind them--Ain't that a bitch! Ryan turns back to Simon Cowell.Out of the car! Now! Cowell all but dives out.Where's your phone?!Jessica?You're okay. It's okay now.I'm here... Oh shit! SCREEEECH! Ryan steps on the brakes, seeing something ahead. WHIP PAN AROUND to see what Ryan's staring at. Just ahead, JESSICA'S ESCALADE is pulling up to the curb.Your car's here. Ryan pulls along side the red curb and watches as four tough- looking men exit the vehicle. We recognize them as Greer, Deason, Ellis and Hodges.Oops. Excuse me. Pardon me. My grandmother needs her walker... Soon, he makes his way to the front, right behind Greer and BUMPS into him. As he does, NOTICE -- ECU of Ryan slyly slipping the rent-a-cop's tiny .38 Special into Greer's heavy motorcycle jacket. Greer turns, glaring -- But no one's there. Greer looks around, and there's a heart-stopping moment that we're afraid he's going to notice Ryan, who now stands innocently the next line over-- --but Greer's eyes pass right over him as he scans the crowd. Ryan breathes a sigh of relief as Greer finally turns away to walk through the metal detector and...Listen to me! They're clearing the terminal. Before your husband passes me, what does he look like?That's not enough! What's he wearing?Found him!But --Holy shit, Jessica, these guys are cops!Hey, can I go now? Can I go?! The Guard nods, and Ryan takes off like a shot, racing back towards the bar. Ryan spots Craig Martin outside the Left Field sports bar. Ryan grabs him by the elbow and starts hustling him through the concourse.Shut up and keep walking. If they see us they'll kill us both.Your wife sent me.Would you hurry your ass?! You need to hide. They're here, and they're looking for you. They already have your family. Craig looks at him, growing terrified.In here!It's okay. She'll explain it to you. Okay, Jessica, I'm handing you over now.Forget about the cash. Just get you and y9ur son home safely and we'll call it even.I know you will. RYAN hands the cellphone over to Craig.I'm gonna be outside this door. Don't come out unless I get you. Got it?Shit!Change of plans. I need to get to downtown fast.I'm already on my-- Suddenly, the cab rounds a bend -- and grinds to a halt from backed up traffic!You've gotta be kidding me! Can't you back it up? The cabbie tries, but is hopelessly locked in by cars pulling up behind him. Shrugs. About a hundred yards up the road, Ryan sees the 4th Street/Figuroa Exit. He's so close...Aw, screw this! Ryan throws some bills at the driver, hops out the passenger side and starts RUNNING.I have an idea... Ryan fights his way through the tourists to the elevator bay. Quickly scans the DIRECTORY. Among the long list of CPAs, there's a MAILROOM on the 3rd floor.Me?Sure, uh... I'm supposed to pick something up for Mr. Fountain over at the Bonaventure.I'm not sure... They said it was a contract, though, I know that, so what would that be, Legal?Uh... Right. Tracking number. It's looking grim. Thankfully, the Supervisor reappears.I might... Maybe it's on the clipboard on my bike? Ryan watches Greer out of the corner of his eye as Hodges and Craig disappear inside the vault.I, uh, may need to call somebody.You believe this? Everyone's got their head up their ass over there. The Mail Clerk ignores him almost as much as Greer wants to. Greer opens his cellphone to make a call, but when the signal is no good, he wanders outside the mailroom toward the window at the end of the hall.Screw the package. Ryan stands and, unable to find anything better, snatches a metal HAND TRUCK sitting by the door, and as Hodges walks by--Damn! --he turns around and starts RUNNING UP instead.Sees Greer and Hodges coming. Big-ass guns out and ready. Shit.' THE ALARM BELLS SCREAM. PEOPLE start filling the stairwell on every floor. Forcing his body to its very limits, Ryan bolts up the stairs until he sees the ROOF EXIT on the next floor up. He shoves open the nearest door and continues running up to the roof. He slips out and silently closes the door behind him just as--Ho - shit! Ryan bolts to the nearest BUS STOP just as a BLUE LINE BUS pulls up.Thank you! As he flips it open, his eyes spot THE LAPTOP on the floor of the passenger seat. Ryan thinks, pulls out his SECURITY DVD and pops it in. At first, the SCREEN is a mere wash of digital gobbledygook-- And as Ryan grunts with frustration -- --a Hi-Res QUICKTIME MOVIE suddenly fills the screen:I'm so screwed. As Ryan speeds away from the curb, he fingers his cellphone.Shut up and listen to me, asswipe. I got what you want.You know who this is, shithead!What--? Who is this?*59 A frickin' telemarketer? But I 159 just hit \"Last Incoming Call\"-- Ryan suddenly puts it together.You bastard. The Telemarketer quickly hangs up before it gets ugly.Feel like a trade?Gotta love modern technology... My new phone knows the numbers of the last fifty incoming calls.Just the woman and her kid.My name is F you. I've got your shit, pal, it doesn't work that way.Fine. Your loss. Nice talking to you. And Ryan hangs up. He waits nervously, sweating, staring at the phone for the longest seconds of his life--Ring. C'mon, damn it, ring! RING! Then it does. Ryan waits a couple rings, slowing his speeding heart, then nonchalantly picks up.Put on a big ass Ronald McDonald smile, apologize to the kid and the woman and bring 'em to the Santa Monica pier.Dude, you're lucky I'm still talkin' to your sorry ass. You do as I say, exactly as I say, or I hang up now and slap this bitch on Nightline, you know what I'm sayin'? There's a long beat.Done.You let me worry about that. What's your cell number?I can hardly wait. Ryan hangs up. A scared, but satisfied smile...You like it? Happy Birthday. THUD. The Friends' jaws hit the ground. And as they run to the Cadillac XLR, Ryan disappears into the crowd...Yeah.First show me that Jessica and the kid are okay.Yes. Where are they?Hang on. Okay, got it. Greer muffles the phone against his leg. Whispers to Ellis:Yes. Greer muffles the phone again. Whispers to Ellis.No. Put them on the Ferris wheel. I want to see them safe first.Deal's changed.I've been thinking. Does me no good to hand over the DVD and then you and the funky bunch take us out. -xLike you swore to protect and serve? The reference brings Greer up short. There's a moment, then:And I'll forget a lot, too. But not until they're both out of danger. Now PAN AROUND TO REVEAL Ryan among the crowd, wearing a SURFING WINDBREAKER; HOODED with WATERPROOF POCKETS -- but where's his cellphone? Moving closer, we see Ryan's wearing the EARBUD MIKE from the Verizon store. With the earbud concealed under the loose hood, Ryan looks like anyone else just watching the show.Your choice, man. The Martins or the DVD. Either way, I'm not hanging around any longer. You got five seconds, then I disconnect your ass.One... Two... On the other end of the phone:Three... Four... --but Ryan's got him by the balls. Angrily, Greer lifts his walkie.Not bad. Most people never get past two. Greer flinches as his own taunts are used against him.Oooh, I think I just pissed myself. Ryan looks optimistic when Hodges gets out and opens the back door. And just as he's on the brink of success--Chloe! Get away from here!It isn't safe to talk, get it? I -- People are after me!Let go of me! Sonofabitch, let go!Aw shit... Ryan's world is spinning -- the NOISE, the CROWDS, theThink! Think!Jess... Jessica? Don't. Jessica trembles with rage, a tear falls.Hey man, your shitty day is about to get a whole lot shittier. Ryan flips open his phone and on the SCREEN plays the SECURITY FOOTAGE of the murder in the parking lot. We see that Ryan must've copied the DVD with his videophone.Ain't that a bitch? And through the tears, Jessica manages a laugh. A small one. But enough to let us know everything's going to be okay. And as we PULL BACK on the scene--It hurts... But you're making it way better. I'm just glad it's over.And to think this was our first date.I do. Don't ever call me again. A shared laugh, then as they turn to the television--", "clean_line": "recording bitch gets extended play screen flashes new record nearby kid watching game nods ryan turns chad shoved cellphone

Public hates us enough without this shit.Keep walking, Shelly. Nothing to see here. A friendly tug of war.She'd say nothing, 'cause she's not gonna know about it!

Crewcut nods and moves off towards the bathroom.Nice try, kid, but I got no time for pranks.Which is it, a kidnapping or a murder?Okay. Give it here. Ryan thrusts the phone at him, happy to get rid of it.Ah shit. Mooney holds out the phone.Hurry kid, take this upstairs to Robbery/Homicide and ask for Detective Tomlin.Up the stairs, Tomlin! Ryan turns away, and as he returns the cellphone to his ear, he's startled to hear--It must've been around '84, when... The Cops turn around, while grabbing their stuff.Hey Tomlin.My anniversary. You know, duty calls; pricey dinner and then some crap-ass play. Hey, I sent some college kid down to see you this morning. Had some rap about a kidnapping --I thought it was a prank at first, but the kid was so worked up--Yeah. Okay, Jack. Thanks. And as Tomlin walks off --Hi, honey. Yeah, I'm gonna be a few minutes late... And as Mooney closes the door and starts up the engine--Ms. Martin?Jessica Kate Martin? The Woman nods. Mooney is plainly disillusioned by the woman. Maybe his hunch was wrong...Mooney. No. No, I guess not. Must've been a prank. I m sorry to have b9thered you, Ms. Martin. Have a nice day. The Woman smiles and nods, and Mooney walks off. When he gets to his car, he CRUMPLES the paper with Jessica's name and address, and shakes his head, chuckling at himself. As Mooney drives off--Yeah, I know. She pulls him back down for another kiss.You're gonna dance with me all night long, until we're too pooped to pop... Well almost. A giggle. They kiss.Yes I will, after I shower. They both share a laugh.Whenever you're ready, hon. Still wearing his holster, he shifts uncomfortably on the bed as he watches the news.What..? Mooney watches as they continue to detail Ryan's \"wild crime spree\", but gets the bigger picture, realizing that every event --the Verizon store; searching for the Martin kid;I need the phone number for a residence. Jessica Martin in Brentwood.The woman at the house didn't have an accent. Marilyn smiles, realizing he's really talking to himself. Mooney hangs up, thoughts racing. He reaches behind him, and without looking he grabs his wallet and keys. He then walks over to Marilyn and kisses the top of her head. She knows him, and knows something's up.I'm sorry honey( but I have to check on something real quick.Delay the reservation if you have to; I'll be back in twenty minutes. And Mooney's gone...Hello? L.A.P.D. Anybody home? No answer. Drawing his gun, Mooney stalks carefully into--Drop your gun, now. I got you. Now we see him. Still down in the entryway, behind some cover, gun aimed and steady.I said drop it.' Bayback relaxes -- then WHIRLS around, disappearing down the hall! Mooney curses and quietly jogs up the stairs, following her into--Damn it! DAMN IT!! Angry, the adrenaline drowning out the pain, Mooney turns to the kidnapper laying in the hall, bleeding out. Kicks her gun away and kneels. But for the first time, Bayback isn't tough. Just scared.Tell me where Jessica Martin is or you bleed to death right here.Oh shit... Mooney grits his teeth against a fresh wave of pain and picks up the phone, dials 911.Request emergency back up and medical units! Officers down at-Jack, she didn't identify herself.I shot a cop! Dana Bayback. From the 23rd. She was one of the kidnappers. Tomlin looks stunned by the revelation.I hate to think more cops are involved, but--...Never got the chance. Detective Tomlin frowns.What's the word?Shouldn't we be on Pico? To the right, some PEOPLE wait for a bus. Tomlin turns left.Let's solve the goddamn thing.That's him! There he is!I've been..looking for..you, kid-- But Ryan struggles, thinking Mooney is with the bad guys. Mooney grabs him as he tries to make a break for it.Jesus, kid, calm down!!

Your husband left a message asking you to meet him in left field. Where's that?--A base ball field !? Wh ich o ne does he mean?!Shut up!!! Which field?! He wouldn't leave a message that didn't make sense to you! Greer tightens his fist and is about to hit Jessica again--Working in my profession as long as I have, you begin to recognize the truth when you hear it. Jessica, trembling, hangs on Greer's every word.Go to the window, Jessica. There's something I want you to see. Relieved at hiding the phone, Jessica gets up and moves to the attic window -- and GASPS.One.. .Two. Frantic, Jessica locks eyes with Hodges, silently pleading for him not to do this. Hodges stares back with glacial ice.Most people don't get past two. Greer signals, and:The police are the last people on earth I'm worried about... Greer pulls a Police Scanner out of his jacket and shows it to Jessica.We get one hit on the scanner about you, we'll be picking out family plots, comprende? Suddenly, a HUMMER, with the BASS THUMPING at ear-shattering decibels, pulls alongside Ryan's car. DMX.Shut up.The Left Field sports bar at LAX.Tell Hodges we move in ten. Deason nods and moves off.-- if you'd just listen to me! I can explain! Someone reach into my coat pocket! Goddamn it, reach into my pocket!--yes. Yes. It's my piece.Just keep your eyes open! Something weird is going on. Greer stares daggers at everyone he passes. Ellis Io9ks around before glancing down at a PHOTO COPY of a California driver's license.Answer me! Greer looks around the crowded airport.For your family's sake, you better not have done anything stupid. RYAN snatches the phone from the bogus Craig Martin -- and hauls ass through a sea of travelers, trying to catch up to --Animals? Ellis whips a burlap hood over Craig's head and they drive off just as--Get out! As Craig reaches blindly for a door handle, Ellis opens the door and shoves him out onto the driveway. Greer yanks him up by his collar.I'll tell you what, you tell me where it is-- --and I won't blow her brains all over you right now. Greer traces the barrel of the gun down Jessica's cheek. Craig looks utterly helpless.Just shut up and talk.Let's go. --Greer and Hodges move forward, ushering Craig out of the room. When the door locks behind them, Jessica once again rushes to the phone.Keep your eyes open.No shit.Here. Cop-instincts crackling, Greer stands on one side of the tarp- covered stockpile and waits for Hodges to secure the other. This is it; they signal go at each other and spring around -- But Ryan's nowhere to be found!Dammit! No, wait! Greer turns and sees a LARGE ALUMINUM CHUTE that leads from the roof and elbows down toward a DUMPSTER on ground level.The kid's outside, headed toward the front of the building--Sonofabitch shot the poor bastard right in front of us!These are the best pictures you could get of him?!Useless! The car parks and Greer storms out, followed by Ellis and Hodges. They head for the house, and the moment they enter -- Jessica reappears. But now she's STARING at something. The Escalade.What?Early twenties? Stumbled out of Brian Wilson's hamper?Tomlin. Take care of him. No witnesses. That's more than Tomlin bargained for.You know once the shitstorm starts, there's nothing I can do to save you.You know a desk jockey named Mooney?Balls his fist in Jessica's hair and yanks her around hard.Bad timing, Tomlin. But it isn't Tomlin on the phone this time. It's--The mysterious bike messenger. How did you get this number? In the Cadillac, PUSH IN on Ryan t9 show the CELLPHONE MANUAL he picked up at the Verizon store in his hand.What do you want?Who are you? What's your name?So, how do you want to do this?No. Somewhere quieter.Fine. But you come alone.How will I recognize you?555-8342. An hour then?Is it taken care of?Good. We're making a trade with the kid at the Santa Monica Pier. Your boy can ID the kid for us. Bring him down.Only take the kid out if it's clean. No guess work. The last thing we need's a stampede. Greer paces anxiously -- when suddenly his Nextel RINGS. He answers it, though it's hard to hear over the music.You here?How do you want to do this?Do you have the disc?See the black van at the bottom of the bridge? Passenger side window.He's within visual of the car. Greer takes his police walkie and toggles it.Did you see that?He's around the passenger side. Have you found him yet?He's the one on the cellphone, you idiot 1Your turn. Now you show me something.That wasn't part of the deal.I swore I wouldn't do that.You know a lot...Okay! Okay. Hodges, put 'em on the Ferris wheel.Shut up and do it!Keep an eye on them. As soon as we make the trade, take the woman and her kid out.Don't screw me kid, y9u won't live long enough to enjoy it.Hodges, do not let them go! Do you hear me? Do not let them go!Under the pier. Go! Go!This is about to be the most enjoyable part of an extremely shitty day. And just as he's about to pull the trigger -- BLAM!! Jessica fires a WARNING SHOT.

Get your hands off m--!!What--?She did? But how--?I don't understand--Okay. Ryan walks out the restroom door as Craig puts the phone to his ear. He sighs with relief -- it's finally over.This isn't my wife.My wife's name is Patty. I'm not Craig. I'm Paul. Paul Boyd. In utter disbelief, Ryan turns back toward the gate -- and sees Greer, Ellis, Hodges and Deason, cornering another MAN. Tall. Lean. Thinning hair. And wearing Buddy Holly glasses. The real CRAIG MARTIN.Who, what?... No one! Nobody!I'll forget I saw anything, just leave them alone! Whatever. Greer manhandles Craig toward the exit.You goddamn animals better not have hu rt -- Greer surprises him with a vicious ELBOW to the face.Goddamn it, what the hell are you people going to--Jessica? Jessica races for the safety of Craig's arms, but just as she's about to be embraced, Greer steps forward and YANKS Jessica back by her hair. She squeals in pain.Ricky...? Jessica nods gravely. He's here, too. Craig looks at his wife's face, bruised and hurt, and tears rise in his eyes.Oh, God, Jess... What have they done to you? But Jessica won't let this moment be about pity.You have to promise. If I give it to you... you'll let my family go.Okay. Enough, you win. But if anything-I dropped it down the mail chute at work. It's gotta be in the mailroom.How will I know she's okay?I love you. Craig squeezes the good years of their marriage into a strong, loving embrace. Jessica hugs him closer. Leans into his ear to seemingly whisper her love in return -- but what she actually whispers takes Craig by surprise.Hey, Benny. This might sound ridiculous, but I dropped a DVD mailer into the chute this morning and I forgot to put down an address.Sure. The Supervisor leads Hodges and Craig away to the back room. Unfortunately, Greer stays behind.This is it. Hodges seems uncomfortable with the Supervisor hovering over his shoulder...run... But Ryan is overwhelmed.
