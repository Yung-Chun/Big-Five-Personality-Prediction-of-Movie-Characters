George Herman Ruth got his nickname because his mom died when he was just a little kid, and he hadda go live in an orphanage.Nobody liked him there. The bigger guys picked on him all the time. And when they messed with him he couldn't fight back, 'cause he was just... like scared. So when they messed with him, he cried about it. He cried... so they called him The Babe.How ya think that kid just felt?- God, whadda jerk!Gonna go play some ball. Need a extra guy. Wanna go?Why not? Doncha like baseball?But what?That's okay.I got a extra one.Yeah. Cool shiner. We gotta stop by the 5 & 10 first. Need a new ball.

Get one!Hey, you can throw it ya know.You think too much. I bet you get straight A's and shit, huh?This is baseball, you're not supposed to think, you're just supposed to play. You ever have a paper route?Throw it like you chuck a paper. When your arm gets here... just let go of it. Just let go.Don't worry. Just stand there and stick your glove in the air. I'll take care of it.Smalls, get one!Keep it.Bingo! Maury Wills!You can't go back there, Smalls.Game's over. We'll get a new one tomorrow. Just forget it. We'll never see it again.Go over there, real slow, and be quiet. Don't touch the fence, just peek through that hole in the green stuff... go on.You did, man.What took you so long?! We been here forever already!- naw, don't, man. He's just mad he didn't think of it.Come on, don't be wimpy.Vote then.

Who's got the big bat now, boys!It was a great shot, but forget about it... game's over. We'll get another ball.Sure we do. You feel bad 'cause you belted a homer, and now we can't play no more.Yeah. Smalls, Babe Ruth is the greatest baseball player that ever lived. People say he was less than a God, but more than a man. Ya know... like Hercules or somethin'. The ball that you just aced to The Beast is worth... well, more than your whole life.When does your old man get home from work?Okay, we need 98 cents. So, everybody spread out and find some soda bottles and cash 'em in. We need a new baseball.It doesn't matter what it looks like. His mom's never gonna know the difference.
