{"Changeling": {"CHRISTINE": {"raw_line": "Walter...time for school, honey.Sorry, champ.We're here, sweetie. Come on.Okay Sandy, what's the prob--Hello? Yes, this is the supervisor, ma'am, what can I -- Yes, I can see that you're on a party line, ma'am, what can I -- I know, it's unfortunate, but people sometimes do listen in on party lines. We hope to have private lines installed by -- Well, what's he doing when you're on the phone? Are you sure? Maybe there's a problem with the phone line. He could be asthmatic, or -- Oh. No, I...I've never heard of anything like that before either. Guess there's a first time for everything, right? No, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about people abusing the equipment or... themselves. I'm sorry. I --Fine, Mr. Harris...fine...just someone having a problem with a... with the connection.Unfortunately that was part of the problem. If you'll excuse me....Hey, sport.So how was school?What happened?Did you hit him back? Good. Rule number one: Never start a fight, but always finish it. So why did he hit you?Wait...you hit him first? Why?Your dad never even had a chance to meet you...so how could he not like you?Well, the same day you were born, something else arrived. It came in the mail, in a box just slightly bigger than you. You know what was in that box? Something called responsibility. Now, to some people, responsibility is fun, it's what you live your whole life for. Other people think it's the scariest thing in the world.Yup.That's what I thought.Walter, I decided a long time ago that I would always tell you the truth, that I would treat you like a grown-up. I can't expect you to respect me unless I respect you. I've never lied to you. Your father leaving had nothing to do with you, and everything to do with what was in the responsibility box.Pinky-swear.First one to the corner store gets ice cream!I'm afraid so, sport. Come on now, time for bed.Uh-huh. I hear there's a new Charlie Chaplin playing down at Grauman's, and a new serial called The Mysterious Airman.I don't know. Nobody does. That's what makes him so mysterious.Not for years yet, Walter. Not for years.Hello? Oh, hello, Margaret. I'm fine, thanks. No, I was just -- You're kidding. When did she call in sick? What about Myrna? I know she could use the extra hours. Oh. No, it's just...I promised Walter I'd take him to the movies today. There has to be somebody else.... All right, I...guess we can do it tomorrow. I'll get there as soon as I can. But just until four, okay? See you in a bit.There's a sandwich and milk in the icebox, and I've asked Mrs. Riley if her daughter can stop by in a couple of hours, just to --Of course you can. She's coming by to check on the house, not you.Tomorrow, we'll go to the movies. Then we'll ride the Big Red down to Santa Monica and walk on the pier. How's that? That okay?I know you're not, honey. That's how I raised you. Be good. See you in a bit.All right, get me the Omaha routing station, see if we can put the calls through their switchers...and let's get that console running....Thank you, Mr. Harris, but I --That's great, Mr. Harris, I really appreciate the vote of confidence.I'm sorry, but I really have to go. We'll talk on Monday. Good night! She races out toWait...wait...hold on, just a --Walter?Walter...?Walter? Honey? Time to come in.Susie honey, have you seen Walter?Mrs. Riley, I'm sorry to bother you at dinnertime, but I was wondering if Walter was here.Do you know if Jamie was able to look in on him?I'm sure it's fine, I just... Thank you, Mrs. Riley.Walter...? Walter.... She starts walking again. Faster now. Looking around trees and porches, anywhere a nine-year-old boy might hide. She hears children playing. Laughing. She picks up her pace, homing in on the sound.Yes, Operator, give me the police.Yes, hello, my name is Christine Collins, I live at 210 North Avenue 23...I'm calling to report a missing child...it's my son, he....I'm not sure...I just got home from work and...it could be since late this morning, it could be just an hour --Yes, of course, I --No, he always stays around the house when it starts to get dark. Can you please send someone down here? POLICE DISPATCHER I'm sorry, but our policy is that we don't dispatch units on missing child cases for twenty-four hours.What? But that's --That's not Walter, he doesn't do that.Please, I --The police are doing all they can, and frankly I could use the money. It's been almost a month, and...it wouldn't do any good to find Walter and bring him home if he doesn't have a home to come back to, right?Excuse me, can I have your attention?Listen, everyone, I appreciate your consideration, but I'm not made of porcelain. I won't break down and cry if the station to station call to Kankakee doesn't go through. Actually, I...promised myself that I wouldn't cry...wouldn't let myself cry...until I knew, one way or another, what.... Point is...I like the noise here. So don't be afraid to talk and...push buttons, and drop things. If it wasn't noisy, how would I know I was in the right place?-- well, if you do hear anything, would you let me know? Thanks, I appreciate it. Goodbye.Missing Persons department, please. Yes, hello, this is Christine Collins, I...yes, fine, thank you. I was just checking back to see if you had found any missing or lost children that might match the -- I see. No, I appreciate that, it's just...it never hurts to make sure all the lines of communication are working. I mean, that's what I do for a living, right? Well, I'll try back next week. If you do hear anything in the meantime, would you be sure to let me know? Thanks. Goodbye.Missing persons department, please.All these reporters...you didn't tell me --Oh, my, I didn't expect --Oh...yes, of course, they've been great. Well, there was that part about having to wait twenty-four hours before filing a report, but --Yes...other than that, no complaints. They've all been wonderful.Walter...Walter!He's not my son.He's not my son. He's not my son.Mistaken?I know my own son.It's a common name, it --It's not Walter.A trial basis?I...look, I'll take him home, but only because I...might not be thinking clearly right now, and --It was...it's...hard to explain.I --Was the sandwich all right? Would you like some more milk?No, thank you.Now you need a bath. You're covered with soot from the train ride.I found you a pair of pajamas. I bought them for Walter but he didn't like the fabric, so --Are you all right?Did you hurt yourself? Let me see --...circumcised....The last time I measured Walter -- the last time I measured my son -- he was four inches taller than you are right now. Who are you? What are you doing here? Who are you?He's not my son.I don't know who he is, or why he's saying he's Walter, but there's clearly been some kind of mistake.He's four inches shorter than Walter. Boys his age don't shrink. If anything, he should be taller.He's circumcised. Walter wasn't.Made him smaller? Captain, please ---- why won't you listen to me?Captain, that boy wouldn't bounce back as my son if you coated him in rubber and dropped him off the roof.I'm not running away from anything, least of all my responsibilities. I'm even taking care of that boy because right now I'm all he has. What worries me is that you've stopped looking for Walter.But you haven't found him. He's still out there somewhere, lost, maybe hurt....And I don't? Captain, look, I don't want to cause trouble for you or the department. Honestly I don't. I know you've done everything you can...but there's been a terrible mistake, and I need your help if we're going to correct it...before it's too late. Please.Oh...yes, of course.Thank you for coming. I'm surprised Captain Jones moved so quickly. I was starting to think he didn't believe me.Doctor Tarr, I thought you were here to help me.My \"motherly concern\" isn't for him because he's not my son.He's four inches shorter than --What about the circumcision?Look, doctor --Wouldn't I know whether or not he was my son? I'm his mother.What're you --Dr. Tarr --Before we go...Mrs. Riley, do you have the time?Thank you.This is absolutely outrageous! INT. COLLINS HOME - KITCHEN - DAYCaptain, I...no, listen to me, this so-called doctor paraded me around my own neighborhood like some kind of derelict mother who couldn't even recognize her own -- He found what he expected to find, what you obviously told him he would find, but it's not -- No, I am not reassured.Yes. Go on up.Stop saying that! I'm not your mother! And you're not my son! She moves toward him, her anger coming out at last.WHO ARE YOU? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME? DAMN YOU! I WANT MY SON BACK!I was wrong to yell at you. You're still a child, and I think you don't really understand what you're doing, the hurt you're causing. Maybe this is all just some big game of pretend to you, but I need you to understand. Walter is...he's all I have, he's everything to me, and every day we lose because of this puts him further away from where I can help him. Whatever the police think, whatever the world thinks, we know the truth, don't we? We both know you're not Walter. Getting you to admit that may be the only chance I have to straighten this out before it's too late. Maybe you're afraid of getting in trouble, that you're in too deep. But you're not. You don't have to tell me who you are, you just have to tell them who you're not. Just... tell them the truth.Hello?Yes? Who is this?Oh, yes, I heard some of your radio broadcasts after my son...you were very supportive, and I appreciate --No, I --\"Acting on the request of the Los Angeles Police Department, Dr. Earl\"I examined the boy quite thoroughly, Dr. Tarr said --Captain Jones promised he'd let me see the report before it went anywhere else.Why are they doing this?Thank you.Reverend Briegleb...I appreciate what you're saying, and what you're doing...but I'm not on a mission. The only thing I want is to find my son, that's all, and I just --If they honestly thought I was wrong, that'd be one thing...but if they don't care, if they're just trying to cover it up....What do I have to do?Well?And...?Does a gap like that get smaller with age? Because that's what they'll say.Will you be willing to sign a letter saying that officially?Well? What do you think? Is that the Walter Collins that you remember?Good morning. My name is Christine Collins. On March 10th, my nine year old son, Walter Collins, disappeared. A four month investigation resulted in a boy being brought to Los Angeles from De Kalb, Illinois. They told me, and all of you, that this boy was my son. They were wrong. The Los Angeles Police Department made a mistake...a terrible mistake. The boy they found is not my son. That is the reason for the supposed \"transformation.\" I have letters from his dentist, his teachers and others confirming that this boy is not my son. The letters are being reprinted now, and I should have them for you tomorrow.I have given the police department every opportunity to admit their mistake and renew the search for my son. Since they have refused to do so, I have no choice but to present my case before the public. I hope this will persuade the police to finish the job they started, and bring my son home to me. Thank you.Why are we using the back door?Is it? She allows a moment of quiet satisfaction as she's led intoIt wasn't my intention to embarrass anyone.No, of course not. I had to get your attention, I had to make you understand...he's not my son.That's not true!I don't know! All I know is that he's lying!Just a minute --I'm not going to sit here and take this --Yes.Wait...what are you doing?No...wait, you can't --Wait...please, this is a mistake.Please...you have to listen to me. The police are doing this to punish me. They tried to force this boy on me and tell me he was my son, but it wasn't my son, and now they say I'm crazy --Oh, god...oh god, please, no....No, please, you have to listen to me...wait...please!Why?That's not necessary --The morning? But...wait, I've got to talk to someone in authority --Then if I could just use the phone.Wait...please! There's been a terrible mistake!I'm sorry, I --Can I see the doctor? Or someone in charge --But I --Christine. Christine Collins.I won't be here that long. As soon as I can talk to a doctor, they'll realize there's been a terrible mistake and --Then I'll just have to prove that I'm not insane.You seem to have given this a great deal of thought.What about you?But how can they --Fine. Thank you.Well, it was. Difficult, I mean. But comfortable.Wasserman Test. To check for syphilis. Apparently it can affect the mind.No. Not at all. I'm sure it's... standard procedure.But...at the same time...I imagine that it would be...would probably be upsetting to...some people that someone else might...suspect that of them. However inappropriate that might be.I didn't say they substituted a fake boy, just...not the right boy. They brought back the wrong boy. Not my son. He's still missing.Yes.People don't change, doctor.That's not what I --No. Of course not.That's right.What for?What kind of medication?I don't want to relax...I'm fine, and I won't take something unless I know what it is!Just listen --Doctor...Doctor Steele --I don't know what's going on, but I'm not taking anything until --I don't have anything wrong with me that I should have to take medication.That's right.Yes.I won't sign it.I won't sign it!I was not wrong! That boy is not my son! And I am not going to stop telling the truth about this! And you're not going to stop me, and the police aren't going to stop me ---- I will tear down the walls of this place with my bare hands if I have to, but one way or another --No!No, I won't let you! Someone, please, help me!Carol! No, leave her alone! What're you --Carol....!You shouldn't have done that.I won't...I won't.That's hardly appropriate language for a lady, now is it?And when's that?Fuck you....and the horse...you rode in on.No....what?Next door.I am out.I don't know...but I couldn't go without saying goodbye --I will...but I want you to know: once I have my boy back, I'm comingWatch me.No...god...no....A little better, thanks. The sleep helped. Anything new outside?I want to go home.I've been giving that a great deal of thought ever since I got out of that...place. All those women, and what they did about Walter.... They're going to just keep on doing it, aren't they? Nothing's going to change...unless we make it change.I used to tell Walter, \"Never start a fight...but always finish it.\" I didn't start this fight...but by god I'm going to finish it.\"Always finish it. Always.\"Hello.Yes...of course.Mr. Hahn, was it?I appreciate the sentiment, but so far they still haven't positively identified any of the...remains... as Walter's.Yes, but...I guess I still can't accept it. It doesn't feel real to me.I'm sorry. Please, sit.I've been on the phone all day with the appointment secretary for the police commission. They won't let me testify at the hearing, or call witnesses. They say it's not necessary.Then we'll just have to hire a lawyer...bring a civil suit and try to get the City Council to call for a hearing by the Welfare Board.I see....Of course. One thing, though. A personal favor. When we've finished here today, could you spare a few minutes to come with me downtown.It's all right...everything's going to be all right now....Reverend, what --I don't understand.I see...well, I...thank you. Can I get you anything?Where is all this traffic's coming from...? Briegleb glances back. The police car has popped its doors, and two trench-coated officers are getting out. Christine stops a man passing in the opposite direction.Excuse me, can you tell me what the problem is up ahead?He didn't mean...he couldn't mean --Oh...my....But...shouldn't we --I'm up here, Reverend.When Walter was...when he was here, I'd walk past his bedroom when he was asleep, and even if I couldn't see him, or hear him, I could...feel him in here.That's why I don't think Walter is dead. I can still feel him, in this room.I know what the police said. But the remains...what they found on that ranch is so...most of it can't even be properly identified. What if that boy made a mistake when he picked Walter's picture?Maybe. And maybe he'd want me to keep looking. Maybe he's waiting for me, somewhere.Ten minute break?We'll see. Thanks, Ben.Yes, hello, this is Christine Collins, we spoke yesterday about my son...fine, thank you. I was wondering if you'd had a chance to go through the file on runaways in your area in case anyone resembling Walter had -- I see. No, thank you, I appreciate the information. Would it be all right if I called you again, in a month or so? Thank you. Goodbye.Oh, hello, I was just --From who?Why?No, I'm...sure I'll be fine.No, I don't smoke.That's where they do what?Mr. Northcott...you asked me to come to see you. You said if I did, you would tell me the truth about my son. Well, I'm here.Now what?What?Why not?Mr. Northcott...look at me. Look at me.Did you...kill...my son?Mr. Northcott --No, wait, please --Did you kill him? Did you kill my son?Mr. Northcott...Mr. Northcott!I can't...I've got a million forms to fill out --Sandy, you guys blew out the phone lines between here and Baltimore, someone has to clean up the mess, and that's me. Besides, I've got a radio right here, I can follow the whole thing.Positive. Go on, have fun.I said I can't go --Ben, that's very sweet, and I wish I could...but I really need to stay and finish this.Ben...? I put down two dollars on \"It Happened One Night\" for best picture. Seems I'm the only one here who thinks it has a chance against \"Cleopatra.\" If I win, how about we have dinner tomorrow night to celebrate?'Night.I'll be here.Over-rated....Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert. I rest my case.I knew it...I knew it! I told you so!Ben, it looks like dinner is on me, I --Yes, this is she. Mrs. Clay? No, of course I remember you, how are you? Is everything --When? Where did they -- No, of course...I'll be right there.Are they sure it's --But how --I am.Why not? Three boys made a run for it that night, Detective. If one got out, maybe either or both of the others did too. Maybe Walter went through the same fears he did. Afraid to come home or identify himself, afraid he'd get into trouble, that people might think it was his fault. Either way, it gives me something I didn't have before tonight.Hope.", "clean_line": "walter time school honey sorry champ sweetie come okay sandy prob hello yes supervisor ma yes party line ma know

J. Jones, Lincoln Park Juvenile Division. My office supervises all runaway and missing child cases, including your son's, and.... He's alive, Mrs. Collins. He was picked up two days ago by local police in De Kalb, Illinois. He's safe and unhurt. He was in the company of some drifter, we've got an APB out for him now, and --Yours is a story with a happy ending, Mrs. Collins. People love happy endings. Train should be pulling in shortly. We'd better get a move on.Thank you...we'll have a statement for you in a little while.Mrs. Collins, I'd like to introduce you to Chief of Police James E. Davis.Women. Just a sec....Well? Aren't you going to --I...what are you --I'm...I'm sure you're mistaken.He's been through four long, terrible months...he's gone through changes, lost weight --I'm just saying...I mean, you're in shock, and he's changed, and --What's your name, son? Can you tell me your name?Do you know where you live, Walter? Do you know your home address?Mrs. Collins...listen to me. I know you're feeling uncertain right now, but that's to be expected...a boy this age changes so fast...but we've compensated for that in our investigation. We're experts in child identification. There's no question that this is your son.It's not Walter as you remember him. That's why it's important for you to take him home, on a...trial basis.Once you've put him back in familiar surroundings, and given yourself time to recover from the shock of his changed condition...you'll see that it is him. I swear to you, Mrs. Collins. I give you my word. Trust me...this is your son.If there's any problem, any problem at all, come and talk to me and I'll take care of it. Mrs. Collins...he has nowhere else to go.Thank you.It was certainly quite a shock. At first she hardly recognized him. Perfectly natural, the boy's been through quite an ordeal.Absolutely.Mrs. Collins --We agreed you would give him time to adjust --Maybe your measurements are off. Look, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for --Mrs. Collins...your son was missing for four months. For at least part of that in the company of an as-yet unidentified drifter. Who knows what such a disturbed individual might have done? He could have had him...circumcised... might have --I am listening, damn it, I -- I am listening. And I understand your feelings. He's changed, no mistake. You've both been through a terrible experience. That's why he needs your support and love to bounce back.Why are you doing this, Mrs. Collins? You seem perfectly capable of taking care of the boy, your work pays you enough to attend to his personal needs...so I don't understand why you're trying to run away from your responsibilities --Why should we look someone we've already found?His identity has been confirmed by the best minds in the field of child identification, people who know what they're doing.Sara, get Dr. Tarr on the phone.Morelli, I want you to find the Collins woman and get her here. Bring her in the back way, and have a couple of matrons standing by.Mrs. Collins.Leave the boy for now. We'll look after him.You've put us through quite a bit of trouble, Mrs. Collins. This situation has become an embarrassment for the entire department.No, of course not. You just told the papers we can't tell one boy from another as a compliment for the months we spent working on your case. Are you trying to make fools out of us? Is that it? Do you enjoy this?You know what your problem is? You want to shirk your responsibilities as a mother. You enjoyed being a free woman, didn't you? Enjoyed not having to worry about a young son. You could do what you wanted, go where you wanted, see anyone you wanted. But then we found your son. Brought him back. And now he's an inconvenience. That's why you cooked up this whole scheme, to try and throw him to the state, let the state raise him for you.No? Even the boy says he's your son. Why would he do that? How would he know to do that?Maybe so. Maybe he is a liar. But that's how he's been trained, isn't it? Lying was born in both of you. You're a liar and a troublemaker and if you ask me you've got no business walking the streets of Los Angeles.Because either you know you're lying, or you're not capable of knowing if you're lying or telling the truth. So which is it, Mrs. Collins? Are you a derelict mother? Or just nuts? Because from where I sit, those are the only options.You want to bring in experts? Doctors? Well, I can do that too. Matron?Mrs. Collins...do you still insist that the boy out there is not your son?You are to convey the prisoner to the Los Angeles County General Hospital Psychopathic Ward.Make the following entry in the booking department: Defendant states she has been deceived by police and others, and that they have given her a boy and tried to make her think it is her son when she says it is not.Mrs. Collins has been known to us since about March 10, 1928, when she reported her nine-year-old son Walter missing.The boy was gone until July, 1928. Since his return, she has complained that he is still missing, and has made repeated requests that he be found, saying, \"This is not my Walter,\" even though positive identification has been established.She suffers from paranoia, delusions of persecution, and dislocation from reality. She may be a threat to herself or others. We recommend that she be conveyed to the psychopathic ward for treatment and observation until her senses can be restored. The matron stops before the desk. The NURSE barely looks up.He's lying.Have you gone soft in the head, Les?He's playing you! He knows he's in trouble, so he's come up with some cock and bull story about how he was forced to stay in the country --He picked the Collins kid! We found him, remember? Haven't you been reading the papers? Or maybe you have, is that it?Tell the sonofabitch to get the hell off police property before I have him arrested for disturbing the peace.What the hell...?Jesus jumped down....Ybarra? Listen. You're not to do anything except come back here.Departmental policy is what I say it is, you got that? Now I'm ordering you to get your ass back here with that kid, you got that? You bring him here and you talk to no one, got it? Nobody!I am.Mrs. Collins has been placed in protective custody following a mental breakdown.Her statements and behavior have been found to be consistent with a delusional state of mind that could make her a danger to herself or others. In the public interest, we are looking after her son while she gets the help she clearly needs.Sorry, we're withholding that information to respect the privacy of the family. But I can assure you that she's getting the best treatment available. That's all.Sir, I --Sir, nobody could have known what was going on up at that ranch. Not us, not the Sheriff's Department, the Marshall's Office...as for the Collins woman.... I'm still not convinced that her kid is among the victims up in Wineville.No, sir.Sir?Yes, sir.Yes, sir.Sir, there's talk of an investigation by the police commission.My boys are working on it now, sir.Did you check the wire services?What about the man he showed up with at the diner?And he overheard them say the name Walter Collins.But why that one? I mean, of all the police departments he could've screwed up, why Los Angeles?The boy, Walter Collins, was reported as missing on March 10, 1928.We then instituted a nationwide search. On July 10, we received a cable indicating that a boy matching his description had been found in De Kalb, Illinois. Upon questioning, he admitted to being Walter Collins, and we made arrangements to transport him back to California.Yes. She denied his identity in spite of all evidence pointing to the contrary.Whether or not this was in fact the correct boy was not relevant to my decision. Throughout this period, she acted strangely. She was often cool, aloof and unemotional, especially when presented with the boy we located in De Kalb, and in our subsequent conversations. It was because of her disturbing behavior that I submitted her for observation to the psychopathic ward of Los Angeles County General Hospital.She wasn't --She wasn't --She wasn't thrown. She was... escorted.I did.September 12th.The form is backdated.That's correct. There was no need to serve the warrant since she was at that time already in custody.Technically...yes.Extraordinary steps were necessary because we were dealing with an extraordinary situation! Is it our fault that we were being deceived by the boy who claimed to be Walter Collins? No. In light of his claims and her behavior, who wouldn't begin to wonder if there was something wrong with her?Because she wouldn't listen, because she insisted on being obstinate and taking matters into her own hands best left to qualified officers, because --Yes.

I'm trying to find a place called the Northcott Ranch, up by Wineville.Just looking into a juvenile matter. Thanks for the help.Hello? ANOTHER ANGLE - POV SHOTAnybody home?This is the police. I have a warrant for a minor named Sanford Clark. Open the door and stand aside.Stop it! Stop it or I'll push your face through the floor!On your feet.Jesus...what the hell's wrong with you? Don't you know assaulting a cop is against the law?We're just sending you back to Canada, son, it isn't the end of the world.You can't just stay in the U.S. as long as you want, pal. We've got a orders to send you back home, and --Didn't know Canada was that funny.It's all right, I'll just see what he has to say so I can go home and get dry. Where is he?It's raining cats, dogs and democrats out there, so this better be worth it.Well?Nothing is.Are you saying he held you prisoner? Bull. When I got to the ranch you were running around free as a jaybird. Could've left any time you wanted. So what's this, some kind of story to cover why you were in the country illegally?Because I don't have time for --What? What did he --Okay, lets start at the beginning. What did he make you do?What kids?How many kids?You're lying.Twenty kids.Nobody can just up and kill twenty kids --How?These...uhm...these kids...do you think...if you saw them again, do you think you'd recognize them? Just a second.I haven't updated these in a while, but still, it should be.... Just go through...and if you see any faces you recognize, put it on the table....shit.... The name on the back of the photo is WALTER COLLINS.Sir, I --With all due respect, sir, I don't think so. You didn't see him, the kid's scared half out of his mind --Sir, if you'd just listen --Sir, department policy requires that all allegations of homicide have to be investigated. And these are kids, for chrissakes --All right, let's go.It's all right, I'll take it from here.We need him for questioning. Come on....You two...you've just been requisitioned for backup. I'll explain on the way.All right. Show me.This it? You're sure?Dig. You put 'em in the ground, you can take 'em out of the ground. Go on.Call it in...get the coroner and every officer in a twenty mile radius here inside the hour.You can stop now, son. You can stop now. It's over. We can take it from here. It's over.Tough.What's your name?Walter Collins is dead.Look, let me explain something to you. Because of your lies, you've ruined a woman's life embarrassed the police department, and got the whole city up in arms over this.All right, if that's how you want it, then I guess we're done here. Tell County Jail we're remanding him for trial.I told you, the real Walter Collins was murdered.By pretending to be Walter Collins, you're interfering in a police investigation of a kidnapping and murder. We can try you as an accomplice to murder after the fact. Too bad. County Jail is a lot worse than juvenile hall or a foster home. A lot worse.Sanford Clark is a kid, too. Fifteen. But he's going to jail. All murderers and their accomplices go to jail. Everyone knows that. Get him out of here. It's out of my hands now.Prove it.Arthur Hutchins.The boy's real name is Arthur Hutchins Junior, age twelve, a runaway from Cedar Rapids, Iowa.Checks out. The report was filed by his divorced mother, who lives in Clinton, Iowa with the boy's grandmother. Apparently he didn't like living with the old lady, she didn't let him get away with the stuff he usually got away with, and one day...he up and left.Just some drifter. The boy was hungry, ran into this guy who said he knew how to get some food and not have to pay for it. Only when they finished, he left the kid behind while he cut out. When the police picked him up, they started going through the wire reports about missing kids --Bingo.I asked him the same question.All right, so after you got into the car, what happened next?Were there other boys present?Did you speak to them? Do you remember any of their names?Walter.Do you remember his last name?So if you only remember some of the names of the rest, how come you remember his full name?And that's the last you saw of him?So you don't know if either of the other two were captured?What happened after that?Why didn't you tell anyone what had happened?Why not?So what made you come forward now, after all this time?Still can't believe it.

So maybe that's why they make sure you got something in you when it happens. They like knowing you fouled yourself on the way to --Sure you don't got a cigarette?The warden, Clinton Duffy, he's a good guy.
