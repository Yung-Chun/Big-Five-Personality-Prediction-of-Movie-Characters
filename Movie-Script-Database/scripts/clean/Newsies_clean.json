{"Newsies": {"JACK": {"raw_line": "Wake up, Crutchy -- The World is waitin'.On me back, Mush.Who says you're fakin' it?TRY ANY BANKER, BUM OR BARBER Jack rinses his face, takes SKITTERY * special care adjusting his THEY ALMOST ALL KNOWS HOW TO red bandana. READWhat's your leg say, Crutch? Feel like rain?Ain't decided yet. Jack spots a passing wagon and helps Crutchy on board -- he and Mush jump on for the ride and they all move off --Your last sure t'ing's still * runnin', Racetrack. *Better choke it, Blink -- 'fore you need another patch.Nothing personal, Blink, but...IT TAKES A SMILE AS SWEETWHO AIN'T AFRAID TO USE HIS...You shouldn't be callin' people ugly little shrimps. Oscar. Unless you're referrin; to the family resemblance in your brother here. The brothers glower, look at each other, then back at Jack, who grins at them.That's right. It's an insult. And so's this -- Jack deftly reaches out both hands and flips the derbys off both their heads. The brothers scramble for them and the chase is on.Runnin'.Ya miss me, Weasel?Don't rush me -- I'm perusin' * the mercandice... Mr. Weasel. * The Newsies love it as Jack deliberately takes a paper, turns and scans. Seeing Les staring at him, Jack winks. Les smiles back, fascinated. Jack turns back to Weasel with a fifty-cent piece.The usual. Weasel grabs for the coin -- Jack flips it out of his * grasp and onto the counter. The Newsies whoop.scans the newspaper for a catchy headline; Race, Crutchy, the others wander up, doing the same. A commotion O.S. and they look up to see -- -- at the window, Weasel is in David's face. *Nineteen, Weasel. An honest mistake -- on account of Oscar * can't count to twenty with his * shoes on. * Weasel glowers -- but wants to get back to business. He backhands Morris who looks surprised.Hold it. Race -- spot me two-bits. Race flips him a coin. Jack slaps it on the counter.Another fifty for my friend here.Sure you do. Every newsie wants more papes.That and a lotta other things -- including Jack Kelly, which is what my mudder called me. What do they call you, kid?No kiddin'. How old are you, Les?No good. Anybody asks, you're seven. Younger sells more papes, Les -- and if we're gonna be partners --You owe me two bits, right? Okay, so I consider it an investment. We sell together, split 70-30, plus you get the benefit of observin' me -- no charge.I don't need you, pal. But I ain't * got a cute little brother to front * for me. And Les here... * ... With this kid's puss and my God-given talent, we can easy move a thousand papers a week. Whattaya say? Deal?Sixty-forty. Or I forget the whole t'ing. David reluctantly offers his hand. Jack spits in his palm and shakes. Les whoops and they move off, Jack already being the mentor --The name of the game is volume, Dave. You only took twenty papes -- why?First t'ing you gotta learn -- headlines don't sell papes, newsies sell papes. We're what holds this town together -- without newsies, nobody knows nuttin'! They move away from Newsie Square as above them, the GOLDEN DOME OF THE WORLD BUILDING glistens in the morning sun.Some newsies got corners, see -- same spot, same customers. Me, * I like to keep moving, enjoy the life of the big city. I spot an opportunity, I sell a pape. That's the advantage of being an independent businessman, instead * of workin' for wages. *You're a natural, kid. You remind me of me -- and I can't say greater than that.Nextry, nextry -- 'Ellis Island in flames -- big con-fla-gration!'Page nine -- thank you, sir. Nextry, 'Thousands flee in panic -- ''Terrified flight from flaming inferno!' Thank you, much obliged --Mine taught me not to starve. So we both got an education.I don't do nothin' the guys who write this stuff don't do. It ain't lyin' -- it's just improvin' the truth a little. Les comes running back, wiping his mouth, with a quarter.Hey, no drinkin' on the job -- it's bad for business. What if somebody called a cop or somethin'?Beat it -- the bulls! He races off. David, confused, races after him, Les looks very worried as he runs with David --Mistaken identity -- all micks look alike to these birds!No? What're they doin' then?The Refuge is this jail for kids. That guy, Snyder, he's the warden.I was starvin'. I stole some food.Yeah, food. My name's Kelly, Jack Kelly, like I told you. Think I'm lyin'?Because I escaped.This big shot gimme a ride out in his carriage.Nah. Teddy Roosevelt. Ever heard of him? David starts to reply when he sees something behind Jack * that makes his mouth drop open. At the top of a short * flight of stairs, a vision is frowning down at them, * speaking in a theatrical Swedish accent. *You wouldn't kick me out without a kiss goodbye, wouldya, Medda? Surprised, she gasps in delight -- throwing her arms around Jack. David can't believe it. Medda's accent quickly disappears.This is David and Les. And this is the greatest star of the vaudeville stage today, Miss Medda Larkson, the Swedish Meadowlark.Medda also owns the joint.Okay if we hang here awhile, Medda? 'Til a little problem outside goes away?They're out west lookin' for a place for us to live -- -- like this. It's the cover of a dime novel with a blue-perfect sky over a perfect yellow desert; a large red sun shines down on a perfect adobe.That's Sante Fe -- out in New Mexico? Soon's Pop finds us the right ranch, they're sendin' for me.Maybe tomorrow we get a decent headline.What I saw today, I gotta say your boys are born Newsies, Mr. Jacobs. With my experience and their hard work -- just a little more, thanks -- -- I figure we can peddle a thousand a week and not break a sweat.More when the headline's good.Catchy words -- like, uh, 'corpse' or 'maniac,' or, let's see, 'love nest' or 'nude' -- Sarah and David giggle; Esther looks shocked.'Scuse the language there, uh, maybe I'm talkin' too much...How'd your pop get hurt?I got my own place... but thanks. * Your family's real nice, Dave. * * Like mine. * David nods, climbs in the window. *Carryin' the banner.SO THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL ASO YOU AIN'T GOT ANY FAMILY WELL WHO SAID YOU NEEDED ONE AIN'T YOU GLAD NOBODY'S WAITING Jack starts down UP FOR YOU? the fire escape to the alley below. WHEN I DREAMHOW 'BOUT A CHANGE OF SCENE FAR FROM THE LOUSY HEADLINES AND THE DEADLINES IN BETWEENHow'd it go at the track, Race?I ate, Mr. Kloppman, I... ... I was dinin' with a family.Awright, pipe down! Don't you see it's a gag? Just Weasel bein' a weasel. Joke's over, Wease. Gimme a hunnerd. He plops fifty cents on the counter. Weasel's grin gets weaselier as he slides it back.I ain't payin' no sixty --You bet -- I move right over to the Journal.Why the jack-up, Weasel?It stinks here anyway -- let's go!Nobody's goin' anywhere -- they ain't gonna get away with this!One thing for sure. If we don't sell papes, then nobody sells papes. Nobody comes through those gates 'til they put the price back where it was.Yeah, a strike -- good idea, Dave.We go on strike, we're a union, right? Keep it comin', Dave --Yeah, we organize -- we get all the New York Newsies to join us! This is great, Dave, keep talkin' --Another great idea! Any Newsie don't join with us, we soak 'im -- just like the trolley workers!Dave's right again! We gotta think this through! Old man Pulitzer and Hearst and all them other rich geezers, they run this city. Do we really think a buncha streetrats like us would have a chance against people like them?The choice has gotta be yours -- are we gonna just take what they give us? Or do we strike? The Newsies are silent, faltering, suddenly uncertain. Then a small figure steps forward and raises his fist:Pulitzer and Hearst have to respect the workin' boys of New York! Keep it comin' -- what else.We talk to 'em.Then we soak 'em.PULITZER MAY CRACK THE WHIP BUT HE WON'T WHIP US! The Newsies answer back. ALL PULITZER MAY CRACK THE WHIP BUT HE WON'T WHIP US! Crossing the square, as ALL they move towards the gates, AND THE WORLD WILL KNOW singing up to Pulitzer's AND THE WORLD WILL LEARN office in the dome at the AND THE WORLD WILL WONDER top of The World Building. HOW WE MADE THE TABLES TURNWe gotta get word out to all the * Newsies in New York! I gotta have * some... whattaya call 'em --Right! You guys gotta be embastards and tell 'em we're on strike!Bumlet, Specs, Skittery take Queens; Pie Eater and Snotty, the East side -- Snipeshooter, go with 'em; okay, who wants Brooklyn? Spot Conlon's territory?Whatsamatter? Scared of Brooklyn?Well, he don't make me nervous. You and me, Boots, we take Brooklyn. Dave can keep us company. Okay, Dave?Me? To Pulitzer?Maybe the kid'll soften him up a little.So's your ol' lady! Tell Pulitzer he needs an appointment with me! The doors slam shut; Denton scribbles, intrigued.-- So this snooty mug is sayin', 'You cawn't see Mr. Pulitzer, no one sees Mr. Pulitzer' -- real hoity-toity, you know the type ---- So I says, 'I ain't in the habit of transactin' business with no office boy -- tell him Jack Kelly is here to see him now.'Yeah, lookit me, I'm tremblin'. Denton smiles, closes his notebook. Gets up, handing David a card.My name really gonna be in the papers?Not as long as you get it right -- Kelly, Jack Kelly. And, Denton? No pictures.You're movin' up in the world, Spot -- got a ocean view and everything. Spot and Jack exchange \"heh-hehs.\" David's getting more nervous.It's a mouth with a brain -- and if you got half-a-one you'll listen. Tell 'im, Davey.'Cause I'm tellin' you.Maybe you lost your guts, Spotty- boy -- -- or maybe you traded 'em to some chicken for that beak of yours. Maybe you gotta show me you ain't afraid to join the strike. Murder's in the air: David and Boots are paralyzed; the henchmen are ready to explode. Spot's eyes are locked on Jack's for an excruciating moment -- then Spot grins.He was concerned about us bein' serious -- you imagine that? Some Newsies gather around, concerned.At least somebody's got the right idea.Who we kiddin' here. Spot was right. Just a game to these guys...The House of Refuge... my home- sweet-home...How can I be sure the Delanceys stink -- 'cause that's how things work. An orphan gets arrested, Snyder gets him sent here to be 'rehabilitated' -- -- the more kids in the Refuge, the more money the city sends to take care of 'em, and the more Snyder can steal. He's here alright.Whattayasay, Tenpin. You got a new guy, Crutchy --That's Tenpin -- s'posed to get out last Christmas but Snyder keeps tackin' more time on his sentence --Go get your hat, Crutch -- kiss Snyder good-bye.Later, Crutchy -- get your stuff. Crutchy stops Jack's hand prying at the bars.They hurt you...? Don't worry, we'll carry you --Crutchy won't last in there... I seen stronger guys than him not make it.Not in it. On it.Runnin' for governor. Showin' his concern, like all pols during elections.Anyway, he's there. I see his fancy coach waitin' for 'im, so I sneaks on top of it. Teddy gets in and he's wavin' goodbye, and all the guys are wavin' goodbye, and Snyder's wavin' -- 'Good-byeeee, Colonel Roosevelt!' So just as we're goin' out the gate, I stands up and -- 'Good-byeee, Warden Snyder!' It was in the papes and everything.He only seen what Snyder wanted him to -- good food, everything the city pays for that Snyder usually steals.Last year he was a hero. This year he's a politician.Look out -- ! A WAGON is ROARING out of the gates full-speed -- barrel- * ling towards the line of Newsies -- *Where's it say that...?We ain't goin' away. We'll never go away.We'll do it up big, all right -- We'll show 'em we ain't tired, or * bored, and the hungrier we get, the more we fight -- We'll have a rally -- every Newsie * in New York -- and we're gonna send * a message: there's a lot of us and we ain't goin' away -- we'll keep fightin' until doomsday if it means gettin' what's ours!We got money, Medda. Some, anyway.Medda's gotta look out for herself same as anybody. We'll find another place.Take it, Medda. Please...? * * Thanks. *Didn't wanna disturb nobody... anyway, it's like the Waldorf out here... great view, cool air --Your mom and pop are worried about me...?You'd like it out there -- they got this big yellow desert and the air's real blue, see, from the sky, and the sun, it's bigger out there.No. No, it ain't... Not that I been there or nothin'.Sure... big family reunion. Soon's I get the dough for train fare.Sounds like you and Dave don't do nothin' but talk about me.Not that I blame you -- me bein' such an interestin' guy and all --What'd I tell ya -- interestin', right? Sarah giggles. The leaflet gyrates in the wind as we GO TO --Hey, Denton -- sit down front! You're the guest of honor!Carryin' the banner!We come a long way but we ain't there yet -- and maybe it's only gonna get tougher from now on! That means we get tougher too -- -- it also means we get smarter! That's why we're gonna listen to my pal David and stop soakin' the scabs --I personally wouldn't go that far, Race.That's right -- start fightin' each other! Prove what the big shots say is true -- we're street rats with no brains and no respect for nothin' -- includin' ourselves! Here's how it is: we don't stick together, we're nothin'. We don't trust each other, we're nothin'. We don't act together, we're nothin' -- and we might as well go back to the streets where we belong. What's it gonna be? Whattaya say, Spot?Carryin' the banner!Hiya, fellas! Hey, Denton -- guess we made all the papes this time, huh? How'd my picture look?You two know each other? Ain't that nice.-- Like demandin' you give us the food you steal from us ---- Last time wasn't no attempt, remember, Snyder? Me and Teddy Roosevelt wavin' bye-bye ---- For my own good, right, Movealong? -- and for what Snyder kicks back to ya --Very impressive. So where do they keep the trains in this station? Seitz shows him into an elegant library. Snyder tries to follow but Seitz stops him, closing the doors. Inside, Jack looks around to see the imposing figure of Pulitzer staring at him, framed by luxurious furnishings. For a moment, the two just stare at each other. Then --Sorry to see you ain't doin' so good, Joe. *I heard of it. You win?Heard of that, too. I don't just sell ya papes, Joe. Sometimes I read 'em. Pulitzer ignores the impudence, continues quietly.You bribin' me, Joe? Thanks for the compliment, but I ain't got the power to stop the strike --Ring for my coach, willya? It's past my bedtime ---- or what? You'll send me back to the Refuge? I'll bust out again --I told ya... I can't call off the strike.And be a scab? Forget it --You shouldn't'a done this, David. They could put you in jail --You go to jail, what happens to your family? You don't know nothin' about jail! Thanks for what you done, but you gotta get outta here --I don't either -- I don't understand nothin' no more! Jack pushes David down the street.Just go!So what's it git'cha?We was beat when we was born. Crutchy, concerned, hears something and closes the panel.Guess I can't be somethin' I ain't.Nah. Smart. *I got no choice. I stay here, they lock me up 'til I'm twenty- one.Who needs it...? I go down to the train yards, hop me a freight, go in the best style -- free...Denton looked out for hisself just like I gotta do -- so save it.Keep reading. Can these words really be about him...? As we GO TO --All them sweatshop kids are listenin' to me...?The minute I show my face, I'm back in the Refuge.Yeah... I'm thinkin' of Newsie Square full of kids...-- Every workin' kid from every sweatshop in New York. We gotta get the word out -- let's go get the Newsies -- They still think I'm a scab...We're Newsies, ain't we? So we make our own paper.Whattaya need to start a paper? Writers, right? So we got Denton. What else?Les. Go set me straight with the Newsies, okay? Tell 'em to meet us later at the World Building.So happens I know a guy with a printing press.They're right above us -- and if Weasel catches us, it won't be just me they'll throw in the slammer -- They can barely hear over the DIN of the PRESSES.I said shhhh! -- or we all go to jail! The others shush him hastily; MUSIC BEGINS as they go into --DON'T YOU BUMMERS GET WHAT I'MWHAT WE'VE COME TO SAY DENTON OUGHTA DO IT HE KNOWS ABOUT THE HEADLINES AND THEY ALL REMEMBER US SOMETHING REALLY FLASHY AND TALK ABOUT THE NIGHT SO EVERYONE REMEMBERS AND DON'T FORGET TO PUT INSante Fe bound, Boots -- but not without givin' Pulitzer one last kiss goodbye --I'd like to, Joe -- -- but I can't hear ya.Maybe. But you can't put every kid in that square in jail. They ain't goin' away, Joe.You sure about that?It ain't about money, Dave -- if Joe gives in, that would mean nothin's like us got power. He can't let that happen -- no matter what it costs him. Right, Joe?Ya got me, Joe -- but tell me one thing, willya? How'd ya like our paper -- nice printin', ain't it? Right off the presses of one of New York's greatest newspapers --Hearst? Nah, it was yo -- David quickly stops him, seeing the gleam in Pulitzer's eyes.Not enough, Joe -- you gotta deal with our demands. Otherwise, our lips are sealed.We just wanna say, 'Thanks, Joe.' And Hearst and them other owners? Maybe they don't have to know. Depends.The strike's over -- we beat 'em!Crutchy -- I don't get it. What happened -- ?What're you talkin' about -- who come chargin' in?Think he could drop me at the train yards?It's now or never, Racetrack.Yeah, Blink, keep ya eye peeled.I'll miss ya, Crutch. Crutchy hobbles off to the dock. Jack looks off at the waiting coach, then holds out his hand to Les, who runs up and clings to him.I ain't no good at writin' and stuff but... I'll be thinkin' of ya...Maybe that's what scares me... Suddenly, the emotions are too much for him -- he turns, runs across the square, not looking back, racing towards the coach.

Behind Snyder, they see Jack bouncing in the front door. Racetrack tries to signal him ---- He was here but he put an egg in his shoe and beat it. Jack sees Snyder -- but instead of running back out the door, he can't resist mocking him behind his back. The Newsies snicker; Kloppman is dying.Give to the Newsies strike fund, mista?Whatta we s'pose to do -- kiss 'em?Hey, Medda, anytime you're off to the races, remember -- I got all the winners!Medda, whattayasay -- you and me, Saratoga.

They laugh and clap his shoulders as he looks uncomfort- able. Suddenly David gasps, seeing Jack led out in shackles, his face bruised and swollen.

Who said anything about partners -- ?If he's the best, then why does he need us?Gotta split fifty-fifty.Bad headline...?Paper, mister? Without breaking the kiss, the man kicks out at David who jumps away. Shaking his head, Jack whispers something to Les, who rushes over to the Lovers, still kissing.Extra, 'Trolley strike drags on!'What -- ? Where's that story -- ?'Trash fire near immigration building frightens seagulls -- ?'Our father taught us not to lie.You just make things up -- like those headlines.Hold it -- I smell beer!Who's Sullivan -- ?The Refuge -- ?I'm not crossing that! Anyway, I don't think they're chasing us --I think they're chasing you! Snyder and MacSwain huff out onto the roof. David, still uncertain, looks back at them -- the runs across the plank. Jack calmly topples the plank to the street as the pursuers reach it, gasping for breath -- he gives Snyder a little salute, then moves on to a rooftop exit --Right, food. He called you 'Sullivan' --You have a way of 'improving the truth.' Why was he chasing you?Bet it was the mayor, right?I won't. I promise.It's late, my folks'll be worried ...

The boys move away, Jack looking back at the beating.He's just sleeping, Momma --Half of it's Jack's -- he's our selling partner. And our friend. This is my parents. Jack nods awkwardly, starts to say something when SARAH, 16, enters from another room with an armload of lace piecework. She's beautiful -- Jack becomes instantly tongue-tied.That's Sarah. My sister. She smiles -- Jack still can't find his tongue. Mayer, seeing his awkwardness, steps in --It's only the beginning -- the longer I work, the more I'll make --The factory. An accident. He's no good to them anymore so they just fired him. He's got no union to protect him.Why don't you stay here tonight...?See you tomorrow. Carryin' the banner.You mean like a strike...?No, I didn't mean -- we can't strike, we're not a union --There's not enough of us -- maybe if we got every Newsie in New York --It's no joke! You saw what happened to those trolley workers --Nooo! Stop and think, willya? You can't just rush everybody into this!Uh... uh... Pulitzer and Hearst have to respect our rights --Uh... they can't treat us like we don't exist... SONG: \"THE WORLD WILL KNOW\" APPROXIMATE TIME: 3:30.It's like a union. The Newsboy's Union. Are we really a union...?No!Ambassadors.Sure. Right after you take our demands to Pulitzer.You're the leader.They're going in to present our demands to Pulitzer.The Newsies' demands. We're on strike. Denton looks around, a little amazed. He takes out a notebook.David...He has to.Are we really an important story...?I've never been to Brooklyn -- have you guys?This Spot Conlon... is he really as bad as they say...?I say something funny? Come on, tell me -- he bad or not? What's the joke? Tell me, willya? We KEEP WIDENING as the figures get smaller and Jack and Boots keep laughing and David keeps asking about Spot...We're not playing -- we are on strike -- it's --Uh... we started the strike but... we can't do it alone, so... we've been talkin' to Newsies all over the city...That... they're all waiting to see what Spot Conlon does.

That Spot Conlon is the most respected and... famous... newsie in New York... and probably everywhere else...And... if Spot Conlon joins the strike, they'll join and we'll be unstoppable so you gotta join and ... well... you gotta... He trails off. Spot nods, turns to Jack.OPEN THE GATES AND SEIZE THE DAY As David sings, DON'T BE AFRAID AND DON'T DELAY the others join in.

Join the strike!How can you be sure they sent Crutchy here?Be quiet -- they'll hear you --!Teddy Roosevelt's. Right?You mean it's true --? Crutchy hears something and quickly shushes them: Jack disappears from the window; Crutchy slumps into a bunk and pretends to sleep -- just as Snyder comes into the room. Utter silence --What was he doing at the Refuge?Teddy's not like other politicians. He's the biggest hero in the country.He's governor now. I don't understand how he could see that place and not do anything --I'll bet if he just knew -- I mean, he's a hero --Join us! Join us! etc. Some of the scabs decide fast -- they throw down their papers and run to the Newsies where they're welcomed with cheers and handshakes -- but then --Listen! Listen up, everybody -- ! 'Like a small but rising storm, the infant newsboys' union continues to gather force -- ''Their leader is a child of the New York streets with a red bandana and a golden tongue, Jack Kelly -- ''The latest clash demonstrates that the publishers might do well to reconsider their strategy of just waiting out the strike -- ' * That's their plan?

We need you.Why didn't The Sun print the story?Denton, what's happened -- you get fired or somethin'?They bought you off... didn't they? Didn't they!That's where we saw Crutchy... He starts to throw up the rope when Boots hisses from the corner, beckoning furiously. They hurry over and peek around the corner to see --One way to find out. Meet me back at the square! David runs after the carriage, leaping onto its back. He flashes the high-sign to the boys as the carriage moves off into the night.Jack!Why're you stoppin' -- we've got to run!It's worth it -- let's go --I don't understand --Nobody sells a pape today -- we're hurtin' them and they know it! Remember -- no soakin', no hittin' -- etc.This is why you wouldn't escape last night -- why'd you do it? Talk to me, you liar! What else did he give you to sell us out -- money? What else? Look at me! You lie about everything -- headlines, your family -- -- because nobody counts but you -- nobody or nothing! Look at me.Keep after them -- we don't need him! Stop The World -- don't scab! Etc. Some chant halfheartedly, confused, demoralized. A few toss down their picket signs in disgust. David moves among them, desperately trying to keep the chant going. The scabs move on, passing Les, who gives Jack a stricken look as he moves away.Couldn't stay away, huh. *A scab...? *Without you, the strike's falling apart...What happened to the ace war correspondent?... Another rally, right under Pulitzer's nose, and not just the Newsies --Be quiet and let me think.THERE'S SOMEBODY THERE.IS SOMEBODY COMING?TOO LATE, GOTTA FINISH IT.The cops are looking for Jack -- we gotta protect him --You lousy double-crossing -- !We won today, but the fight's not over.

But how do I make more money, you bloodless blot?Then Hearst undersells me and I'm in the poorhouse. Brilliant.Wait. What do the Newsies pay now -- fifty cents per hundred papers? If you raised it to sixty cents ---- then that, multiplied by forty thousand papers a day, seven days a week -- well, it would pay some of the bills around here.Not necessarily. As newspapermen, Hearst and I would cut each other's throats to get the best of the other. But as businessmen -- and gentlemen -- we often agree on ways to keep down certain operating costs. If I know Willie Hearst, he's going to wish he thought of this himself.If we do it, they'll all do it. It's only a tenth of a cent -- nobody gets hurt! It's good for the Newsies -- an incentive, make 'em work harder, sell more papers! Now get me Hearst on that contraption.

Perhaps you'll join us -- we can talk about the coming election.You know the boys, Mayor -- Mr. Bennett of The Tribune, Mr. Taylor of The Times, of course you know Mr. Hearst -- and this is a new member of our little group, Mr. Gammon, who just came back from Europe...Know what I was doing when I was your age? I was in a war. The Civil War.People think wars are about right and wrong. They're not. They're about power. You know what power is?Power means that I could see to it that you serve your full sentence at the Refuge. Or I could pull strings and have you free tomorrow. It means I could give you my pocket change -- and you'd have more money than you'd likely ever earn.I disagree. You're the spirit of the strike, without you, they'd fall apart in a few days.Shut your mouth and listen ! You're going to do exactly as I say ---- and be a fugitive who's pursued and caught and returned. I'm offering you a choice -- is that what you choose?I'm not asking you to. All I ask is that you return to your old job -- as Newsie for the The World.For a few days. Then the strike ends -- and it will end, boy, make no mistake -- and you can go wherever you want to buy a ticket. Free and clear, with money in your pocket... and no one chasing you.

I wondered why so much, against so little -- 'Les, come on -- you're supposed to be helping me today.You... stupid... ape!

She removes the stained pages from her shawl.Denton's story.Just listen! 'The men who run this city are terrified of the Newsies strike -- because other child laborers in the factories and sweatshops are hearing the message of the Newsies leader --''In the voice of Jack Kelly, these children hear strength and pride. Most of all, they hear hope...'Whatever happens, it's Jack's decision. He's the one in danger. They look expectantly as he stares off, deep in thought.What -- ?BRING THOSE OVER.TOO LOUD!

What's your name?David. As in David and Goliath? You really think old man Pulitzer's going to listen to your demands?Doesn't it scare you going up against the most powerful man in New York?Keep me informed -- I want to know everything that happens.What's important? A year ago I covered the war in Cuba -- charging up San Juan Hill with Colonel Teddy Roosevelt. A very important story. Now it doesn't seem so important -- except Teddy's our governor and probably on his way to the White House. Is the Newsies' strike important? It all depends on you.Any objections?Why don't you stop this -- ?You're kids. They think you'll get tired, or bored, or maybe just too hungry. And with my colleagues on the other dailies not allowed to cover you ---- They can just ignore you until you go away.I'm working press tonight. The only working press. As usual.Aren't you Warden Snyder? Snyder nearly swallows the whistle --I'm Denton of The Sun. I've heard about your work with young people. I wonder if you'd agree to an interview? Snyder blinks at him, glances at his watch, then lowers his police whistle, smiling modestly.Is it Snyder as in 'snide'? Furious, Snyder blows the police whistle for all he's worth. Instantly police burst in from every door -- all converging on Jack. Immediately he leaps off the stage into the arms of several boys below -- then fights his way out the front door --I'll pay the fines. All of them.Meet me at the restaurant, all of you. We have to talk.None of the papers covered the rally. Not even The Sun. Jack is stunned, David bewildered, as Denton turns abruptly and leaves the courtroom. The Bailiff shoves Jack in front of the bench. Snyder slips in from a side door.Because it never happened.If it's not in the papers, then it never happened. The owners decreed that it not be in the papers, therefore... I just came to tell you fellows goodbye. They exchange puzzled looks. David sees Denton's expression.Reassigned -- back to my old job as The Sun's ace war correspondent. The owner thinks I should be covering only the 'really important' stories. So wish me luck, boys. At least half what I wish you. They don't always fire you, David. He moves off; David, stunned, hurries after him.They could've blackballed me from every paper in the country. I'm a newspaperman, I have to have a paper to write for. He looks at David; hurt, betrayed, angry; wishes there was more he could say. He hands him something from his coat.This is the story I wrote about the rally. I want you to read it at least. He hands it to David and goes. David returns to the others, angrily crumpling the story and hurling it onto the table. The boys look puzzled; Les, still eating the sausage, picks up the story and looks at it curiously.' -- And that is what terrifies the powers-that-be, for they know our city thrives on the shame of child labor. Therefore, Jack Kelly's voice must be stopped, whatever the cost... Damn good writing, isn't it?You'd have help this time. I've been investigating the Refuge -- I know somebody who's going to be very interested in Snyder's little racket.This war'll do for now.How're you gonna reach all these people? No paper in New York will print anything about the strike.A printing press. And no paper or printer is going to defy Pulitzer. The others look discouraged; Jack's thinking again.I thought you'd feel that way, Governor Roosevelt.We brought the Warden over to say goodbye. Goodbye, Warden.Governor Roosevelt's very grateful that this problem was brought to his attention. He'd like to offer you a lift, anywhere you like.
