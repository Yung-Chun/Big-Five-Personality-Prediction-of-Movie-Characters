What happened to Grandpa Max?Jardine residence, good evening.Who is this?Yes. Shooting Script 07/27/15 6.Umm...No, they're not home yet.Twelve.What service?Hold on a second.I don't know.Can you hand that to me?Here, pass me that. I can carry it.Not in the end, he's not. I just finished The Blood of Olympus.Now? I'd like to, but... I can't. It's my grandfather's--I think you're supposed to say, \"I'm sorry for your loss.\"Oh, that's okay.It's the sky.Yeah, it's the sky above Camp Jupiter, the day of the battle.Not really.We don't live here. It's just a reception.Yeah...I don't know.Okay.I don't know.Mom. I'm on vacation!Dad said it was okay.Love it. Love the flowers.Where's Mom?

They're my drawings!New ones are never like the old ones!So?Why the weird names?Finished?What's a dacha?Sounds complicated.What part?Hi Mom.I thought you weren't working with the Terrain anymore. I thought you were going to do Broadway now.You said you weren't doing this non- profit stuff anymore. That the strategy was to reach \"a wider audience\".Good evening, Mrs. Calvelli.My father's an actor. And my mom is a psychotherapist.I like it a lot. It's more peaceful than Manhattan, and we have much more space. It's great.I don't know.Maybe.I don't know. Maybe.Sure, yeah. I guess. He's not that successful or anything. Shooting Script 07/27/15 30.I think my dad applied there.But I'm not an actor.I guess I can try. Shooting Script 07/27/15 31.Is Hern\u00e0n your mom's boyfriend?I don't understand.Where is he now?Do you miss having him around more?Sometimes my dad goes away, if he's shooting a movie. But it hasn't really happened in a while. Shooting Script 07/27/15 32.I don't know. He's been in a bunch of plays and stuff.Do you wish they still lived together?Ewww.Imagine if your mom goes with you on your safari, and they end up falling in love again. Shooting Script 07/27/15 33.But just imagine: you get an envelope one day. You open it and it's two tickets to a safari. One for you, and one for your mom. And she decides to go, because she feels like she needs a vacation. So when you get to Africa, your dad picks you both up at the airport, and takes you to this incredible place. Like this photo here. You see lions and elephants, giraffes. And then, it's the end of a beautiful day in the African savannah. Your dad wants to take you up this big hill to see the sunset, but you're too tired, so you tell your parents you're going to rest in your hotel room.A green sky with yellow stars...Yes!And hot dogs.He can sleep over.He won't mind.Dad!Can Tony sleep over tonight?And a sleep-over!Can I have mine with cheese, mustard and ketchup, please?I'll have some afterwards.I almost fell.I almost fell crossing the Parkway.I'm sorry I don't understand.I'm sorry, say what again?You want me to say again that I fell?With words?I almost fell on my way to class today.I almost fell on my way to class today.You're not listening to me.You're not listening to me.You're not listening.You're not listening.I don't know.I paint, but you need to have something special to be a painter, and I'm not so sure I've got it.No thank you. Shooting Script 07/27/15 52.Hi Leonor.Is Tony in the office?But we're supposed to meet some friends.What??What happened?? Shooting Script 07/27/15 53.But your mom--Hi Dad!Can Tony stay and eat with us?Why not? He wanted to ask you about your acting career.Dad, c'mon!Please, Mom? Please?I'll eat it tomorrow for lunch, I promise.Yes! Thanks.Yes we are.It's okay Tony. I'll see you tomorrow.Goodnight, Mrs. Calvelli.Yeah, see you tomorrow.Why not?Why doesn't she want me over?Why are they so mad at us?You're right. My dad was very cold to you.I won't talk to my parents either then.Really. Not unless they apologize.Of course I can handle it.You too.No, why?I never thought about that.They're all very nice.Tell you what?I don't know.Well I do have an idea you might like.Eva talked about going dancing. There's a matinee club, like after hours, for kids.Sunday afternoon, in the City. Shooting Script 07/27/15 73.It would be fun, right?Mom! Dad! Mom!!Mom!!!Mom, Tony told me Leonor is being evacuated from the store!That's worse!How could you do that? How could you do that to them? Dad??The rent is too expensive! She can't afford it, Mom. So Dad needs to give her a discount so she can!It's okay, I'm talking now! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'll never do that again. I promise. Dad, I promise.I have a great idea.I know. He loved Leonor too. Tony told me!But I have an idea! I know how we can make it work! We go back to our old apartment, and we rent this place and give the money to Aunt Audrey. Tony and I are both going to be at the LaGuardia High School for Performing Arts in Manhattan, so I won't need to take the subway or anything to school. I can walk. And you'll be closer to the theater. I loved the show, Dad. I loved it. Tony did too. We both talked about it a lot afterwards. You were so good! And I thought it was really complex and everything. I'm sorry I didn't tell you then. I'm sorry. But I loved it. I really did!I'm sorry, Dad.There was a bump on the path...I'm better now.There was a bump, I didn't see.Yeah. Go slow.It hurts when I go like this.I just need to finish one painting, and then I'm done.I want them to be good.The one who sold her hair in India for a train ticket?Have I seen her dance?Gee, thanks Dad. That's a very encouraging story. Shooting Script 07/27/15 98.I don't know.And how do I know if I have the balance?I don't know. I don't know what he's doing.What do you mean?Would it have changed anything?Dad, would you mind if I give you some advice? Would that be okay.Don't worry so much.That's all.Dad, would you mind if I play one of my video games? I know it's Tuesday, and I know I should do something more productive with my time, but I'm kind of tired.Will Mom be mad?Yours looks different too.How was it?And how's your mom? Shooting Script 07/27/15 102.You could've sent me an email from Africa.I love that necklace.Hey, you should come meet my buddies from school.I did.There's this girl in my class, her mother is on Broadway, she can act better than anyone I know.We should all go out together sometime.Sure.Cool.No, but I've met someone.

Brian Jardine, we've met.Thank you.I know.I don't think you've met my wife Kathy.We're having a little reception upstairs. Just family and a few friends.Got it, son?You okay with that, Antonio?Well thank you, Tony. I appreciate the help.Let me see. That was our first year in the house. Look; I still had braces.He was a handsome guy.What?Yes. I'll let you have the photo IF......you let me have the first edition of The Velveteen Rabbit.Jake, come here.Do you remember Grandpa's friend Stu Gershman?He likes to draw and paint.Aww... Thanks, Stu. Did you hear that, Jake?I swear B, I'm surprised at you. I sit there waiting for you to wake up, but everything's great with you.No?Why? What other worries you got?I ain't been feeling good. They bother me since they came.I don't know, B. I don't want to talk about it.You go \"you don't like me, heh?\" Shooting Script 07/27/15 16.Of course.She's good.Jake. He's great. He's in seventh grade already.Dark Rapture?Two. Three, maybe. Shooting Script 07/27/15 17.It really does.Great to see you also, Suzanne. Maybe we'll see each other again soon.She fucking hates me.Ever since B.U. She dropped out - I stayed and graduated. Every time we've seen each other since then, she always tries to prove that she's better than me.Did I?I'm telling you. She doesn't like me. I'm in a slump, Roger. You need to help me here. Shooting Script 07/27/15 18.I thought that was the strategy.Why don't you come help me prepare dinner?Your mother had an emergency with a patient. She's going to be late tonight.Jake!What drawings? Help me cut these.Those old drawings?Did you look in the trunk?I don't know, Jake. Maybe they got thrown away.Why don't you just make new ones. Shooting Script 07/27/15 24.Jake. We moved. We got rid of furniture. We threw away clothes, and we gave books away. We have a new apartment.Listen. Let me tell you something. It's good to get rid of stuff. It's hard at first, but then it feels really good. You have to learn to let go.I play Trigorin. He's a celebrated writer, and the boyfriend of a famous actress, Arkadina.Can I finish? Her son Konstantin is an aspiring writer who lives with his uncle Sorin in this dacha, where they all come together one summer to see his new play.That's just the beginning, actually. Shooting Script 07/27/15 25.A dacha is like a big country estate in Russia. That's where the whole thing takes place, and that's why the funny names. There's also Nina. She's the neighbors's daughter, who wants to be an actress. At first she seems to be in love with Konstantin but ends up having an affair with my character, Trigorin.Well, it is complex. And unexpected. But it has a lot of humor in it too.How was it?I was just telling Jake about the play.It's not that simple.Well, things have changed.Yes, Jake?Well, hello Leonor.No, please, you're not... You've met my sister Audrey, haven't you?Tony, do you want to have hamburgers and hot dogs with us tonight?Done deal, bro.Please. I can't tell you how happy I am that Jake has a new friend. He spends too much time alone. And it's not easy for him with other boys. So it's great that he and Tony get along so well.You've got a great kid, but I guess you know that.You know, Leonor, after my father died, there was so much to do. We decided to move in, and time just flew by. You and I haven't really had a chance to talk about the store, and all that stuff. Maybe we can have a chat this week?Next week?Thursday I finish rehearsal early, so I could come by early afternoon.Great.C'mon guys! The burgers are getting cold.Of course she's going to say that. Contract is up.Guests first. What do you want on yours, Tony?Jake, have some salad also.Tony, salad?Sure, Tony. That's fine.Maybe we should talk about this later?More seductive, you mean.I'm so sorry. Rehearsal went later than I expected. Is this still a good time?The store looks nice.The reason why I'm here, Leonor...Your lease has been expired for more than six months now. I guess you guys were about to renew it when my father passed?My sister and I are working on the transfer of ownership for the house. It's almost done; Dad left everything in order, all the taxes paid and all that. The only thing still pending is the store, which needs to have a new lease. Shooting Script 07/27/15 56.The situation has changed, and now we have two families owning the house; mine and Audrey's. It's better for us, and for you, to have things done the right way, wouldn't you agree?Leonor, this neighborhood is changing very fast. The rents have gone up quite a lot in the past few years. I'm sure you've noticed.We don't want you to go away. My sister Audrey has prepared a new lease for you, and we think it's very fair. We aren't trying to get market rate here, we know that's not possible, but still, you can't expect to pay the same rent you paid when you first moved in.Here, why don't you take a look.That's a ridiculous thing to say.This is not what I came here for. Why don't we go back to the lease. Take a look, please. It's fair.Well, I guess there's not that much more to be said then.Goodnight, Leonor.Sure, but just give me a moment.Is Jake here?Jake, you know it's a weekday. What are you doing playing video games?!No. Shooting Script 07/27/15 59.That's enough for tonight. Turn it off.I said no.Tony, you need to go home now. We can talk about acting another time.I'm sorry, buddy. Your mother is waiting for you downstairs.Hey.Did something happen with Leonor downstairs?The store is closed. It's not even five yet.Have you seen Tony?Jake, can you stop playing around for a second??Did you see if the store was open earlier when you got home?Was it open?No? It wasn't?Talk to me Jake!Audrey. Hi.No, I haven't heard from her. Today I got home early and the store was closed, it's strange. Isn't it better if you call her?But I feel very responsible. We are responsible.She sort of did already.She told me we owe her money for the store.Yes, I know.No.No.Is that inspired by that book I gave you?The Blood of Olympus.Yes. From what I remember, only 2% of the students who apply to LaGuardia get accepted. This means two out of a hundred. Twenty out of a thousand. They're not just looking for talent; they're looking for serious commitment.I didn't \"flunk\"!I wasn't accepted, which is different.What does that mean?No, it's not terrible. It's sad, but I don't blame you.Sometimes. But I live in his house, so I probably think about him more than you do.I don't want to have to do that. Shooting Script 07/27/15 79.I just don't want this to get ugly. The boys are best friends now.Just give me a little more time.Do you want some more?I think it's going to be great. I love my part, I love the actors, the play is fantastic.Did you see the sign Leonor has posted in the window?She doesn't acknowledge the new lease, she doesn't try to negotiate and she has no plans of leaving. And now she's actually hiring new people, can you believe it?Audrey wants to start an eviction process. She has a lawyer ready to go already. Shooting Script 07/27/15 82.Is it?I will. It's my problem.He's just being so childish lately.Well, thank you, Roger.Is that a good thing?Isn't it! Chekhov called it a comedy in four acts.It is.So?Did you understand why Nina says she's the seagull?Do either of you care about anyone other than yourselves?Jake? Say something.Say something!One of the hardest things to realize as a child is that your parents are people too. Can you understand that? That they care about things. That they make mistakes. That they try to do what they think is right. Does any of what I'm saying make any sense to you?What's so funny, Tony? Why don't you tell me, what's funny?? You think being an actor is easy? You think you have it in you for one rejection after another? Let's see how you react when you don't get into LaGuardia. Let's just see then.God damn it!!I doubt it.The Seagull.Can you give me five minutes alone? Please?Only my wife. I'm a lot like Jake. I've never been good at having close friends.I hope you can understand that what's happening is nothing personal.I am in a new play. But it's not big, and it's not a lot of money. It's just the way it is, Leonor. I'm fortunate enough to have had a father who left me a house in Brooklyn.Leonor. I also have a sister, and she has her own family, and we all have to decide together what to do. It's not just up to me.They were very much alike. I'm sure he would agree with Audrey that, above everything, it's important to take care of business.Leonor, what do you want me to say? I have a family. We have bills too.He had the flu.Well, he's not around anymore, is he.Yes, he's doing his homework.Of course, Tony. Come in.Why don't you both come in. Leonor. Please.He talks! Jacob talks!It's a terrible situation.Your mother and I wanted to talk to you, Jake, but this not talking didn't help! Shooting Script 07/27/15 93.Jake, calm down.Let me explain to you, Jake. Grandpa Max left this house not just for the three of us here.He liked Leonor, of course, but he left the house for us, and also for Aunt Audrey.How are you, Son?What happened?Are you hurt?Let's go home.Dad had a heating pad that he used to use. I can't find it. You know where it is?Do you still have a lot to do to finish your portfolio? Shooting Script 07/27/15 97.That's what you said last week. You just had to finish one painting.Jake, do you by any chance remember that story I told you, about my friend Tina?No, that was Martine. Tina was a girl I knew in high school who was a dancer. Her mother was a dancer. She was literally born to be a dancer. She had a perfect ballet dancer's body, and all of us were certain she was going to be a big success.No. During high school, she got into a really good conservatory, and I ran into her a couple of times after that, and she was always about to get this, or about to get that. But each time, her arm would be in a sling, or she would be on crutches. She would have a pulled ligament. Or a stress fracture in her back. The last time I saw her, I ran into her on the subway, it was clear she hadn't danced for years. She was fat. You would have never imagined that she was the same girl.Why do you think Tina didn't go very far?She trained too hard. She practiced too much. She didn't trust her own natural abilities.Jake, you're going to meet a lot of really talented people in your life. But they won't all be suited to be artists, they won't all have the brains to know when to insist, and when to stop. When to push yourself, and when to relax. Most of them won't have that balance.That's why I'm telling you this, because you'll turn in your portfolio soon, and they're going to love it. They're going to love you. I know they will. You'll go to LaGuardia, and you'll have fun, but also plenty of challenges. Soon enough you'll find out if you have the balance.There you go. Do you know if Tony got in?Son. I wish I'd done things differently. Shooting Script 07/27/15 99.With Tony, and his mother. I wish I had told you earlier what was going on.No, probably not. But still.Please.That's a lot.Of course, Son.I don't think so.
