I think we may be working on the same case. If so, I could use your help.The body?Mind if I have a look?Where's the head?Whose footprints?Yes, I'd say we're definitely working on the same case.An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser. Amazing. I have a copy of this in my office at home.In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.Not at all. I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.Lieutenant --Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago? Twelve bodies on board.Yes. That's my case. Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated. Brains extracted. Limbs torn to shreds. It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.No. There's more. There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat.If you don't mind, this could be important.Unfortunately, no.How did you get away?A guard? Do you remember his name?How do you explain the part about Beauregard?I believed them.No. I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.We've met. The Hacksaw Murders. '89.I hope you liked it.Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.Correct.This isn't an animal, Vince. I've been on this case four months, remember? I've learned a few things.Let me tell you about it, Vince.Excuse me. Has Dr. Green left?Dr. Green?Special Agent Pendergast. FBI. Forgive me. I guess I was snooping. What is this?How does it work?No. I came to talk about Dr. John Whittlesley.Maybe not.You have time to talk?Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat. That boat washed up in my district. Everyone on board was killed.Disappeared. His body wasn't among the victims.The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten. Just like Beauregard. One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision. The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact.You loved him.You were going to be married.I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley. Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times. I also found a record of your restraining order.You were afraid of him, weren't you?Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?A monster?What happened?What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there? Was he desperate enough to create one?Something came up in autopsy tonight. Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.I don't think so. I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun. Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?Would you mind showing it to me?Where would we find it?All right. I'm as macho as you are. Perhaps.Dr. Green! Dr. Green!What happened?I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.Where did you see it?All right. If you're positive.Stay in formation together. Take it room by room. Check for footprints, any signs of disturbance. If you see or hear anything the least bit suspicious, I want to know.Bailey's going to be in the guard house outside. Officer Van Dorn is right down that hall. When McNitt's done, he'll relieve you.Dr. Green...They're all heavily armed.What was it?I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.Yes.I understand. But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems. Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.That would jive with what we got from the preliminary DNA read-out. Here, have a look.Genetic damage?We need someone to take us to the secure storage area.Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.How many storage areas are there?Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?And failed. These doors are solid steel.I wouldn't be so sure.This must be the one that held the statue. Let's see what else is inside.Read it out loud.I think the scratches were put there to scare us. Perhaps even lead us to this note.You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.Are there any hidden rooms or staircases? Places where someone could hide?Where is that?You said you had plans of the museum. Could we see them, please?Apparently it's huge.We haven't got time. You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.These plans indicate there's a walled over entrance to the sub- basement right around here.Hard to read in this light. The ink is so faded.Not yet. Let's try the fork to the left.Keep the light up. I can't see.Shut them up!Stop!Quiet!Forget the dogs. You two, get back here. Don't point that gun at me.Get back! Now!He's right. Follow me.I'm ordering you! Cover me!Come on. Let's get back to the others. We can't leave them alone.Not on the map. Looks like it connects with the city sewer.We're coming back!Identify yourself! Who's there?Quiet.Stay calm.I know where we are now. We're getting out, Jonathan. This should be another door.Another storage room.Something's happened. The power's out.All right. I know where we are. This is the osteo prep lab. I was in here earlier. We're safe now.Keep the animal quiet.Go out the other doorway. There's a stair at the end of the hall. Up five flights is a corridor that leads to the Hall of the Heavens. Find Lieutenant D'Agosta. Bring help.Halt!Margo! Frock! It's coming! Run!No. I think I'm hallucinating.Gone.No. A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball. I think it was bothered by my light.I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish. Like nothing I ever saw. I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.But this isn't the jungle! This is New York. How did it get here? A thing like that crossed two continents. It makes no sense!I don't believe it.But what can we do? Our guns are useless --All clear.You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.He's right.Footsteps!Where are you? Who's there?That was D'Agosta.Vince!This door's locked. Try shooting the hinges off.No. The planetarium is in the next cell. This is one of the fire doors...Vince? There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.I've been down there. It links up to the old sewer system. I can guide you out.Go out the north exit! There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases. Run!Hide quickly!Buy them some time.Hey you big tub of lard! Over here!Come on, you smelly pile of refuse. Come get me. I dare you!It's scared of me.Drop the fibers!What happened?It didn't want the fibers. What does that mean?Then it won't go after the others?For what?We're fine. Take the left fork behind you. You'll be in a straight passage. When the hall forks again in fifty yards go right. Then radio back.Vince? Can you hear me? Vince!How?It's deceptively simple. Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.Oh God! Help!It's coming. Run.We're not going to make the storage room!Please, no! Don't hurt Margo!Run!What?I don't believe it.Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it!I have to shoot.He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot. Call him, Margo.You have to. Do it now!She's over here.Nice to see you, Lieutenant.I'm in town on a case. Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.Dr. Frock, I was wondering.

Beautiful day.Yes, I do.I'm an Evolutionary Biologist. What do you do?Evolutionary Biologist. I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.Hello, Ian. Everything ready for the opening of the Superstition Exhibit?I'd wish you luck but I'm not superstitious.But at what a price.I have the species identification on these teeth. We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program. Call Dr. Frock. He wanted a demonstration.What?That's impossible.Is it true? Greg said you'd been fired.I don't believe it.We can't do without you. You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology. You're practically an institution around here.\"Phyletic Transformation and the Tertiary Fern Spike\" is not going anywhere. I'll talk to Cuthbert and put a stop to this right now.Let me help. I can take care of everything.How can you say that? You know it's not true.My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.Your work is highly relevant. What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology? Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.I'm not giving up.You are this museum. It won't be the same without you.What's going on?Dr. Frock, I just saw a man back there who'd been wading in blood.For once I'm glad you're rumor central. What in the world is going on?That Cuthbert. What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.Mbwun.Warrior deity of the Kothoga, an extinct South American tribe. Dr. John Whittlesley led an expedition that found the only known representation of Mbwun. The statue is said to carry a curse. Every member of Whittlesley's expedition died.You have a warrant to look at that?An invention of mine. It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA. I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was... You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John. Is he really dead?If he were alive he'd have contacted me.And John?I don't understand.John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that. He was a fine man despite his problems --Yes. Once. We met at Columbia. John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.How did you know that?That was two years ago. John was still in love with me. He wouldn't leave me alone.He was afraid of himself. He tried suicide once. He was ill. Manic depressive. He had wild emotional highs and lows. Not a happy affliction for a scientist. He'd been revered in our community. By the end he was a joke.A legendary monster called Mbwun.Yes. He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection. The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a \"monster species\". It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.No one knows. The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.No. I'm all right. I won't let this affect me anymore. John wouldn't get help. His ego endangered the lives of others. His theory came first.I don't understand.My God. Then it was an animal.I don't know. He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation. But I've never seen it. It's in the exhibit.I'm not sure. We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.Mr. Pendergast! I found it.Pendergast! Over here --What the...Pendergast? Who's there?I don't know.You were behind me? Running after me?It's okay, I'm all right. I remember now... It was an animal. Something large! I could smell it. It was hunting me. I saw two green eyes in the dark.Behind me. Over there.That's not what I saw.I can't think straight at the moment. I know how crazy this seems. Please, Mr. Pendergast, I need some fresh air. Could you get me out of here?I didn't imagine it. I know what I saw. Are you sure there are enough men in there?All right. This is hard for me. I'm a scientist. I like order and logic. Sometimes too much. There's got to be an explanation. There can't be an animal in there. But I saw something.I don't know. Mr. Pendergast. Do me a favor. Get me a DNA readout on that claw.It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.According to this, twenty-five percent of the claw DNA is unidentifiable, about a third is homo sapien, and the rest is Hemidactylus Turcicus.Turkish Gecko, I believe. A lizard.There's another possibility. A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair. Viruses can damage DNA. So can radiation, certain chemicals. Even cancer. Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out. I have to get started. This will take several hours.Osteo prep, Karl.A blow dart. Seed pods. A plant press. Pretty unimpressive stuff.What is it?Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui. John used it as packing material.What about those seed pods? Are they from the same plant?What are they?It's reptilian.Let's not jump to conclusions. This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat. Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard. If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?Look at this. An ambyloid reovirus protein. That explains why the computer's confused. The plant's infected with a virus.But a virus normally codes for other viruses. This one's making human and animal proteins. Listen to this. \"Glycotetraglycine collagenoid. Weinstein's tropic hormone. 4- monoxytocin supressin hormone.\"What kind of hormones?Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.This is it. This is what he, or it... is after! The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!Yes. Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant. When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach. The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing.It's all right. That means the G.S.E. has finished analyzing the claw DNA. Greg, you go find Pendergast and Lieutenant D'Agosta now.All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw. \"Species unidentified. Genus: unidentified. Phylum unknown. Male, weight in excess of 240 kg. Brain capacity, 900 centimeters.\" That means it's highly intelligent. \"Quadrupedal.\"\"Nocturnal. External hair and bony plates. Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers. Reduced optic chiasm\"... poor eyesight. \"External mucoid nasal glands,\"... very keen scent... \"Morphological characteristics: Highly robust. Aggressiveness: extreme.\"With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.And it's hungry. It's been two days since it's eaten. There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell! All those people in one enclosed space...What's going on?I think so.Dr. Frock. Did you hear that?What's that?Dr. Frock! Quick!Pendergast? Are you all right?You're not. Where is it?Wounded?That would fit. It's nocturnal. Quick. Come inside.It's not supernatural. Mbwun is an animal. Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.None of that matters now. The people upstairs need us. We have to help.That thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes.We have the fibers. Don't you see? The creature is hungry. It wants the hormones in these plants. It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers. We're just a poor substitute. To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.No, Dr. Frock. You can't.Unlock one of the other storage rooms. We're going upstairs. We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.No. You'll need me --No, not footsteps! People running for their lives!We will.The planetarium!Yes, he's fine. Greg... take care of yourself!Is there another way around?What are you going to do?What is it doing?Its eyesight is worse than I thought. It couldn't see us. And it couldn't smell us through the glass.I think... it means it's full.No. It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.I think... for the pleasure of the kill.We have to try and draw it off!The answer's right in front of us.That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing. The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!Help! Please someone! Help!Help someone!You smell that?Listen to me, Pendergast. Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien. In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain! If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it. Shoot it in the eye!My God. You understand.Please let me go. We won't hurt you.John's necklace! You killed him!Oh Jesus. John?No. It's not possible!John? If it is you... I can help.No! Don't kill him! Pendergast, you were right. It's John!That thing is John Whittlesley. I should have seen it before! The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA! He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states. He probably entered the country as a man. It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum!You have to! Listen! All viruses pass on their own DNA. Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses! This one was different. It inserted a whole array of genes into John. Reptile genes, sixty five million years old. Those genes remade him! It's not his fault!No. Wait! Let me talk to him first!No!John... you can give up now! Just lie down where you are!Just like John. He won't listen.Do it, quickly. Please. Aim for the eye.I can't!John! John, look at me!No time for fishing anymore?How about lunch?Okay.Dr. Frock?I'm so glad to see you. What's the occasion?He's changed. He's always working on his thesis. He comes in early, stays late. I tried to get him to join us, but he never takes a break.Yes.

If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain. My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo. It was late August. Over ninety. The polar bear was inside his cave. Kids didn't know he was in there. All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear. By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces. The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --You've been holding out on me Pendergast. You have a suspect capable of this?We all love the museum. I come here myself with my kids. We're trying to work with you.What's that?This place is a maze.My kind of art.My favorite is the two camels.Man, that's ripe.Holy shit.The lid of this crate is scratched with claw marks, just like the door.Look.
