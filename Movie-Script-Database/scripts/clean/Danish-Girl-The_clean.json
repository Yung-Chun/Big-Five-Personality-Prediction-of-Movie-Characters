{"Danish-Girl-The": {"GERDA": {"raw_line": "I'm sorry...?Oh yes. He'll be impossible.And Rasmussen...Only because he was drunk!You were loving it!\"I don't say my client is the best landscape artist in Denmark...\"\"He is in the top one!\"Do you know what time it is?No - I'm ready to start work.I told you, I...What?No. But I'd like you to ask nicely so I don't feel such a pushover...Not at all. I could see his being here made you uncomfortable.It's not uncommon.It's hard for a man to be looked at by a woman. Women are used to it, of course, but for a man...Well?Is that bad?Fine.Another view of Vejle. I don't know how you can paint the same thing over and over.Could you please not speak to Rasmussen about me again... My work is my business. Stay out of it.I have my period.Are you?Could you help me with something?Ulla has an extra rehearsal. She cancelled again. Would you try on her stockings and shoes?Hvappe...Smart aren't they?Well just do what you can.I haven't asked you to.Such concentration. Sometimes when you're working, I think you're going to slip through the surface of the painting and vanish.He's probably still sitting on a rock, sobbing his heart out.Oh. So we don't need to worry about Hans.I didn't mean to disturb you.What?You're very observant.I might let you borrow it.Oh really...? Is there something you'd like to tell me?No... I'm your wife. I know everything.Both of them...?You've had too much champagne.I don't think anyone is likely to be corrupted by seeing my ankles.It was a dare. But when I said hello to him, he actually blushed! He was so shy! So I asked him out.I was sure. I still am.I don't know...Turn it back on.I still am.Did I wake you?Wondering about things.Wondering if we made a baby last night.Wondering when you got so pretty.Hello...?Do you think?With you I enjoy it.And that's why you hate them.Giving them your Einar Wegener.You'd be very convincing... You might even enjoy it...You'll have to shave closer.Better than I ever manage.Knee over... head up.. Look at those hands... relax...Why, Miss Lili, you are forward...We have plenty of time. I bought these...What is it...?Of course you are...Ulla, let me introduce...That's right. Einar's cousin from Vejle...No. No, never.Well you're a pretty girl, you'll have to get used to that.No, I'll stay with you...Have you seen Einar? I can't find him.Quickly, lean on me...How are you...?I think it would be better if Lili didn't come here again.You know what I would like to understand?Did he know it was you?I watched him kiss you, Einar, so could you please make an effort?!But Lili doesn't exist. We made her up.We were playing a game!This is absurd. We need to stop. Make it stop Einar.Another headache?Can I get you something?Maybe you should see a doctor.I thought you might not come back.Is it?Einar's cousin.A series back at the studio.You're taking them.Are you alright...?No.Not this.Why can't you just be honest about this!Okay, I need you to tell me... when Henrik and `Lili' are together, they what...? They kiss - we know that...There have been other men?I don't know what to say.Einar... what is this? What's happening...Einar, that's not true.He says it will be over very quickly...Of course not.No, that's not true...I won't be long.Away. Why, what's wrong?Well that's wonderful...In Paris...?Oh - I can't travel just now...I've been asked to exhibit in Paris...Yes. We have to go. Rasmussen said it would make all the difference...You can. I'll take care of you...Can't you just do this one thing for me?I had a letter from Hexler...But he won't. Everything will work out for us. Really - I know it. You just have to trust me...So. Is there anything to take care of before we go? Anyone you need to tell?Einar's a painter too...No, she stayed behind in Denmark.Will you sit for me? Just as you are. We haven't done that since art school. You enjoyed it then...I miss you. I miss you working beside me.Well you could help me with this background. What does it need...?Thank you so much for...Of course, no, I know that...Perhaps if you let me speak, things would be clearer...?I asked him, I wanted to meet you, put a face to a name...I'm married to Einar Wegener.You remember him?He told me that you kissed him once.He doesn't know I'm here. I don't think he'd like me asking for help.Einar...?That might change.It's Hans Axgil.You know, Einar's still stricken with guilt about crashing your kite.No - it's too cruel.No - no, it's not that. We should order without him.Of course not!Really. He's expecting you... and it will do him good...Yes, Einar painted it just before we left...Can I take your coat Hans?I didn't know that.Would you like to see more of Einar's work...?Yes, of course, Lili...Lili...You... you ought to go...Please - please - I'm sorry...I don't know...Sleep now. We'll talk more tomorrow.No... we've never done that. Lili's never spent the night...A new dress...Yes. It's perfect for you...She's a popular girl. Thank you for coming.We've been busy.Einar hates this kind of thing.I don't mind.He's excited. We have an old friend coming to town: Ulla Fonsmarck, the dancer. Do you know her?No. Thank you.No.I am still Einar's wife.I'm fine, honestly...You'd know if you'd been there.You should have come.This is not how it goes! We do these things together!Stop playing that stupid, stupid game!You should have been there!Not everything's about you!I need my husband. Just get him!I want to talk to my husband. I want to hold my husband. I need him. Can you get him? Can you at least try?I can't...I'm always alright.Einar always comes back in the end. He always has...I'm sorry.No.You know what happened with Hexler.Lili watches her figure...Oh good... you're awake... how do you feel?Where?Did a doctor say that?You're not insane.Sometimes I think if it hadn't been for the paintings...But now she's making you ill.Do you want to try one more...?And I believe it too.What happened to the man? Was the operation successful?It's important. Hans says the Germans will check your papers.I wish you'd let me come with you.Here, take this...I'm going to walk.I'm sorry?He asked me not to.No. If I go, it'll be alone.I am like Einar.I want you to go away.No, I'm sorry...My God...I'll do that. I'm here now. Don't worry, I'm here...Have I...?Lili! Lili, you're late...And these, only if you need them.You know one night last week, I had the strangest dream.I dreamed you were getting married.Who knows? So many strange things have happened. *I know it was Einar. But really it was you and me. 26/11/15You're going to need a new notebook if you carry on like this.Perhaps I should try it.Well, people have been known to do both. I'd be curious to see what you painted, that's all. Sometimes it's hard to know what's in your...I didn't. But I promised Einar I'd take care of you.Oh, no that's fine. Just tell him... just say...No you shouldn't... *It's too soon.You're not strong enough...Warnekros...? He hasn't seen you.It could kill you.I won't help you to hurt yourself.I'm not angry with you, I'm worried about you.Come. We both need our rest. I can sleep in the chair, there...I don't mind... 26/11/15Cigarette burns.You keep it. For now.Yes.Goodnight.Room 9.Yes.Go away... thank you. Leave us * alone.Lili...?You know you had us worried...I think you should rest...It's an old habit. I'm slow to change.No.Lili...No - leave it..!

I've finished.Can't a man watch his wife get undressed?Leave it on...I might enjoy that.Why...? Is there something you'd like to know...?We just pretend to be shocked because it encourages you.Out of the question.She can go without me.Gerda loves a scandal.Look at the way she dresses, flaunting her ankles. An invitation to corruption.I was.She made me. She seemed so sure.Unmarried people are so delightfully easy to shock.You were shameless.Beautiful shameless Gerda...Why?What things?What d'you think?Oh, I was always pretty, you just never noticed.In here...You should go, you enjoy it.Look - it's good to be seen at those things.

How was it? Did Lili have fun?Fine. I understand.Nothing.It wasn't as simple as that. It's hard to explain...He may have known who I was. But I wasn't always... me.

You of all people to understand.No... No, Lili's never gone further than that with a man. She... she wouldn't...There was another, but it was a long time ago.I'm so sorry...Six years.No.Yes. Perhaps less now than...Inside me.Really...?I don't need to do this... There's nothing wrong with me..This can't be right...You've hurt Lili...Don't worry about me, I'm fine.What are you doing?That's wonderful...I'm not sure I can do that...But surely there's no rush...Gerda, what's happening?He wants to lock me up.I do...No.I think my work is a little... introspective for French taste.Gerda... please...

Even in Vejle...Well I was different.I wanted to thank you for looking after Gerda. 26/11/15I've let her down.Every morning I promise myself I'll spend the whole day as Einar. But there's so little Einar left.No. I think Lili's thoughts. All the time. Even here, now, I'm having to work so hard just to... to be me. To be this.I think sometimes about killing Einar. It's only the thought that I'd be killing Lili too that stops me.No doctors.Well, I don't really know what kind of help I need, but I can't go on living without knowing who I am.Do you think I'm insane?I'm sorry, I know we agreed no more... but look at me.What...?Oh no... no, no.
