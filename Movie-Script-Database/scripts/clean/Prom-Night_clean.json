He flips a switch on the console and the MUSIC STOPS. He sits there a moment, thinking. Then he turns out the lights and exits.Who's there? Hammond, shaken, looks across to the far wing. There's an elevated platform where the electronic control panel is located. Alex peers down.I'm testing the board... I didn't hear you... nobody's supposed to be here yet...All set, Miss Benton. Just have Davy roll the tapes.My sister?Kiss the king?You look almost like a woman!You're my sister...

The sisters start to walk across the lawn.Who?Nick? Oh, he's all right, I guess. They walk on in silence with Robin stealing glances at her big sister.Robin? Robin smiles and takes Kim's hand. They walk along the road, kicking rocks and swinging their bookbags. Sud- denly Kim halts.Scared tiff. She leans over to kiss her mother. Vivian automatical- ly turns her cheek to Kim without looking at her.You know, Daddy... Nick.Have you got a date for tonight? His mouth crammed.full of Twinkie, Alex mumbles his reply.Alex! Jude's cute... Besides, she's funny and really smart. Give you somebody to do equations with!Not bad but it's not romance.If you get a chance, dance with Jude once or twice, okay?See you later,'Mom. Vivian gives her a thin smile. Hammond takes her arm and leads her into the imposing building.You're worried about Mom?Hey, keep that! Alex groans but does as she asks.He's creepy.Kelly says he's a pervert, spying on the girls undressing in the locker room.I'.ve got to decide on my hair style for tonight.Yes, as a matter of fact... I was just...That's my business.You really ought to tell him that.You and Nick haven't been together in ages.Really? So who are you going with tonight?I'll try and remember that.: So then she threatened me.Jude.None of your business.Let's go. They head down the hallway to their lockers. Lou tags along.Go play with yourself, Lou.Shhh!Read the note?Yessir... Well, it's mostly talking about...(reading ahead,But, Mr. Weller, tonight's the prom...Looks like a party.It's an improvement! She turns her back to him.That's not true! Alex was trying to help me. The teacher looks from Kim to Lou to Alex.What a pair!You wearing that green gown tonight?I am excited, it's just... in some ways it's such an awful day... It's Robin's day...My mother's all upset, as usual. My father too... he doesn't show it so much... It's hard to get over something like that. Robin would have been a junior, like Alex. This would've been her first prom... I guess that's'why it seems so much worse this year... She stops, turns and faces Nick. It's hard for him to meet her gaze.That's my father... I've got to go, Okay?Shhh! Kelly takes Jude aside as Kim and Vicki approach Henri Anne.She said that?Well, actually no, Miss Benton. can't make it... You know Mr. Weller?He.. umm..Vicki, don't...What about us? Wendy finishes brushing her hair, shoots Kim.a dark look, exits.Maybe I asked him... Kelly looks at her friend.Let him? She looks at Kelly. Neither girl hears the SQUISH of RUBBER SOLES moving across the wet tile floor. Suddenly there are LOUD VOICES. Melanie comes through from the locker room, laughing. Behind her, Wendy's ANGRY WORDS are AUDIBLE.Watch it... Kelly covers her breasts with her arms, presses against the wall, terrified. Suddenly there's an EXPLOSION of SOUND. Kim screams, jumps back, stares. There's a jagged hole in the cen- ter of the mirror, huge cracks radiating from it, spidering across its surface. For a moment no one moves. Splinters of GLASS TRICKLE down to the floor. There's no other sound. Kim grabs for her towel, steps out of the shower, looks. There's no one. She heads for the locker room door. Kelly runs after her.What did you see? Kelly just shakes her head.I'd like to see my f ather .Oh... There was... Somebody broke a mirror in the shower room... There was somebody in there...Something came up... 'Afternoon, Mr. Weller.Because he can't get in anywhere else!Hello? Adele twists her head around to look at Kim. Her \"Rainbow\" collapses. Spinning around, Adele sits cross-legged on the floor and smiles at Kim.Yeah... I've calmed down a bit...Has my father been back?And he didn't leave a message?Thanks, but I can walk. Kim starts to leave, turning around at the door.You're going?Hi. Oblivious, Hammond buries the axe in the stump. Kim moves around to face him. When he sees her, Hammond jumps, startled.Why are you doing it now?Your secretary?I liked her. Hammond angrily jerks the axe from the stump.No. How is she?Great!I think getting dressed up and going out might be good for her.Hi, Mom.Nothing's cooking, Mom. You must've forgotten. Slipping out of her reverie, Vivian turns around to face Kim.You'll be beautiful.No... I never...I wouldn't take it without asking you... Vivian's very wound up.Well? Alex gapes, stunned by his sister's appearance.You shouldn't have pulled away...

Who's the killer?Killers, here! Wendy advances. Terrified, Robin begins to back away.Are you crazy? They'll put us in jail! Confused, Nick cannot reply. The other girls grow silent.Kelly? Kelly looks from Wendy to the mangled body and begins to whimper.Swear!Screw you, Lou! Wendy slams the receiver into its cradle. Grabbing her books, she storms out of her bedroom.How the hell do I know? She exits.Bravo... Kim stops abruptly. Standing onstage, watching her, is Wendy.Thinking about Nick, maybe?You wish! Nick is King of the Prom, you happen to be Queen of the Prom... that's all there is to it, Hammond... As far as anything else... Nick is mine...I'm telling you, okay? Stay away from Nick!You know nothing about it!It's not who you go with, honey... it's who takes you home.Wait and see, bitch... Just wait and see...We'll talk about it later, lover. Bye. Wendy smiles and strolls away. Lou follows her.You can owe me.A small diet cola.That ' sit. The Car-hop shrugs, wheels away. Wendy turns to Lou.I'll buy you one for Christmas, all right? Now, how do I know you're serious?I don't want anyone hurt... not badly.Lou, shouldn't we go over this. Lou puts his finger to her mouth, silencing her.Don't worry about it.. She unbuttons his shirt and begins to kiss and lick his chest. Slowly she works her way down. Lou begins to writhe. Wendy's head disappears from VIEW. Lou's eyes snap open in surprise. Wendy groans.Just be a minute... Kim and Kelly hang up their towels and step into the showers.I'll be right there, Melanie. No answer. Curious, Wendy moves around the lockers, investigating. The room appears empty. There's a sudden LOUD CREAKING. Wendy whirls around. A locker door is swinging slowly open.If you ever try anything like that again, you cow! Melanie thinks it's hilarious.What's this supposed to mean?I didn't! She turns, glares at Melanie.You're all... children... She storms out. Melanie looks at Kim and Kelly, shrugs, follows Wendy. A DOOR SLAMS in the locker room. Kim and Kelly look at each other, laugh, turn their faces back to the steaming water.
