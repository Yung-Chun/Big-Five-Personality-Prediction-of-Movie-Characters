{"X-Files-Fight-the-Future-The": {"SCULLY": {"raw_line": "Mulder -- it's me --I'm on the roof.No. I haven't.I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost --Mulder...?Jesus, Mulder...I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.Now what?So much for anticipating the unforeseen...Had you.Oh yeah. Had you big time.I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.I just did. You're buying.Something sweet.Scully...Where are you, Mulder?Is that you pounding?Nice try, Mulder.C'mon. Open the door.Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.I need this building evacuated and cleared out in ten minutes! I need you to get on the phone and tell the fire department to block off the city center in one mile radius around the building --DON'T THINK! JUST PICK UP THE PHONE AND MAKE IT HAPPEN!This is Special Agent Dana Scully. I need to speak to S.A.C. Michaud. He's got the wrong building --Mulder found it in a vending machine. He's locked in with it.Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.Can you defuse it?Let's go, Mulder.What are you doing? Mulder ---- Mulder! Get in the car!There's no time!They're asking for you, Sir.All I told them was the truth.They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.They're not doing this, Mulder. I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore. Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.I'm sorry. Good luck.No.Are you drunk, Mulder?Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.Go home, Mulder. It's late.Mulder -- what are you doing?This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?And you're looking for?I can tell you that without even looking at him. Conclusive organ failure due to proximal exposure to source and flying debris.This body has already been autopsied, Mulder. You can tell from the way it's been wrapped and dressed.Oh my God. This man's tissue...There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here. I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.Yeah.I can't really talk right now.Evidence of a massive infection.I don't know.Mulder --I've got a hearing tomorrow --Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense hereI wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now. The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.May I?I don't know, Mulder...He didn't mention a park.I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain.The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.No. It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --It looks pretty green for this climate.All the equipment is brand new.Do you live around here?You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?I think you better tell us.Well, we're FBI agents.I don't know, Mulder.That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.I don't know why I think they went right.This is great. This is fitting.I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.-- of what exactly?!They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.What do you mean by haul? What are you not telling me here?Mulder --I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this. Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --What do you think it is?This is weird, Mulder.Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.I think we're on top of something. I think these are some kind of venting.I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.What do you think those are for?Yeah...?What are you doing?Mulder?!Mulder!Where'd they go?I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with meThese are fossilized bone fragments I've been able to study, gathered from the bomb site in Dallas...Yes.That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --Yes. I know.Nothing completely conclusive --I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --Agent Mulder.Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --I have. I did. It's done.I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papersYou don't Mulder -- you've never needed me. I've only held you back. I've got to go.Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.OUCH!!!I think... something stung me.Something's wrong... I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm......my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.No -- it's --I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.Cold...Where are we?I can't...I can't go any farther.Mulder...Had you big time.Mulder...What is it you find incredible?No, they don't.I don't believe the FBI currently has an investigation unit qualified to pursue the evidence in hand.", "clean_line": "mulder roof haven ve climbed floors hot thirsty wondering honest know threat called federal building street mulder terrorist bomb threat called logical purpose providing information allow bomb rational object terrorism promote terror study model behavioral pattern virtually case threat turned explosive device act accordance data ignore chances great actually bomb lives lost mulder jesus mulder know bored assignment unconventional thinking going trouble ve got quit looking isn ve closed files procedure followed protocol anticipating unforeseen oh yeah big time saw face mulder moment panic buying sweet scully mulder pounding nice try mulder mon open door mulder tell joke hang gonna need building evacuated cleared minutes need phone tell department block city center mile radius building think pick phone happen special agent dana scully need speak michaud got wrong building mulder vending machine locked mulder away door coming defuse let mulder mulder mulder car time asking sir told truth divided mulder splitting meet opr day tomorrow remediation reassignment think idea cited history problems relating wanted invalidate work investigations paranormal think goes deeper mulder left career medicine thought difference fbi recruited told women percent bureau felt impediment opportunity distinguish hasn turned way transferred omaha wichita field office sure rise hold ve seen reason left stay anymore maybe ask heart sorry good luck drunk mulder got idea come thought gotten drunk decided come talk quitting home mulder late mulder firemen died dallas looking tell looking conclusive organ failure proximal exposure source flying debris body autopsied mulder tell way wrapped dressed oh god man tissue kind cellular breakdown completely edematous autopsy performed incision internal exam know killed man sure anybody claim knew man die bomb site got saying bombing cover mulder going time somebody going figure soon supposed violation medical ethics yeah talk right evidence massive infection know mulder ve got hearing tomorrow mulder way past point common sense herei wasn planning particularly spending half hour cold storage morning got better look blood tissue samples took firemen couldn information causing kind attention soon avoid right virus men infected contains protein coat ve seen extremely fast unlike aids virus aggressive strain survives nicely outside body know simple contact blood blood respond conventional treatments health threat know mulder mention park evidence archeological kind digsite sewer storm drain bone porous virus causative microbe digesting immunohistochemical tests looks pretty green climate equipment brand new live supposed talk told think better tell fbi agents know mulder question answer going miles direction ve got choices wrong know think went right great fitting ve got washington hours hearing outcome possibly affect biggest decisions life standing middle texas chasing phantom tanker trucks exactly haul gas tanker trucks haul oil tanker trucks haul viruses tanker trucks mean haul telling mulder believe fucking believe know ve ve times mulder pounding dirt road middle night chasing elusive truth dim hope standing right right dead end think weird mulder thoughts anybody growing corn middle desert cool temperature regulated think think kind venting hear humming like electricity high voltage maybe think yeah mulder mulder apologize making wait ve brought new evidence methese fossilized bone fragments ve able study gathered bomb site dallas yes bombing dallas destroy bodies firemen deaths reason wouldn explained yes know completely conclusive hope working develop evidence agent mulder salt lake city utah transfer effective immediately gave skinner letter resignation mulder debated tell person knew verge mulder contacting state board monday file medical reinstatement papersyou mulder ve needed ve held ve got assigned debunk work reign shut ouch think stung wrong having lancinating pain chest motor functions affected pulse feels thready ve got funny taste throat ve got allergy mulder think think ambulance cold farther mulder big time mulder incredible believe fbi currently investigation unit qualified pursue evidence hand"}, "MULDER": {"raw_line": "Where are you, Scully?Did you find something?What's wrong, Scully?You're looking for a bomb.I think they have that covered.What happened to playing a hunch?The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...What are we doing up here? It's hotter than hell.How's that?What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.It's locked?No you didn't.Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi?

It's the lives we didn't.-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.What? What are you talking about?Why?They were the ones that put us together.This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.You're... quitting?Yup.What do I do. I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. \"Spooky,\" they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.Does what?Sorry. Don't have one.What?How's that?Do I know you?You follow me out here for a reason?I know the name. Why?How'd you find me?You a reporter?Who sent you?Well, if you've got something to tell me, you've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab...And what's that?He just let it explode.The Federal Building was too well guarded.Before the bomb went off?Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?I think you're full of shit.I wake you?Why not? It's three AM.I was until about an hour ago.What are you implying, Scully?Is that what you'd like me to do?Get dressed, Scully.Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.We're going to the morgue.On whose orders?General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.Well, call General McAddie.They can patch you in through the switchboard.Hey! We don't have time to dick around here watching you demonstrate your ignorance in the chain of command. The order came direct from General McAddie. Call him. We'll conduct our business while you confirm authorization.Thank you.Why is a morgue suddenly off limits on orders of a general?According to this tag.Does this fit the description you just read me, Scully?It's like jelly.You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.I'd been told as much.I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?I think this is it up here.Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?I'm looking for him.What's that?Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.No. Don't bother.Not according to the men in blue.They want to discredit you -- for what?You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --How?You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?What was it?What killed those men?I'll know soon enough.A plague?Negotiating with whom?And they tell me I'm paranoid.How can I reach you?No calling Hawaii.Why are you whispering?What did you find?What kind of infection?Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.Scully...? Hello...?I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?Have you examined them?I'd like this person to take a look, if you don't mind.You said you weren't coming?What did you find?How was it contracted?You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?And you've never seen anything like that?This looks like new grass to you?Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.Hey!You see anybody digging here?Nobody. Same nobody who put this park in? That new equipment... They buy you these bikes?How do you know?Maybe you've been watching too much TV.Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?And where are they going with it?What are my choices?Where would they be going?You think they went left?Five years together -- how many times have I been wrong.Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?What?We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.Yeah, well they may this one.This virus -- it...It may be extraterrestrial.Been where?I have no idea.Very weird.Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.For the purpose of what?You hear that?Maybe. Maybe not.Scully....?Run.Come on!Scully?!Scully?!I don't know.Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.I'm not sure. A virus --What did it look like?There were bees. And corn crops.What are they?A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.Your guess?What do you mean, your guess?You told me you had answers.You've been using me --You didn't know my father --You're a liar. You lied to me to gather information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn't you?Kurtzweil!Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.What? What's wrong?You can't quit, Scully.We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --Just like that --I need you on this, Scully --You're wrong --You saved me, Scully. As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing. I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.What? What happened?It must...Scully...I think you're in anaphylactic shockScully --This is Special Agent Fox Mulder. I have an emergency -- I have an agent down --She said she had a taste in the back of her throat -- there was no pre-existing allergy to bee-stings -- the bee that stung her may have been carrying a virus --Oh god...Tin Man. Scarecrow. Toto.What am I doing here?Penetration but not perforation.When was that?Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --They took her --Where's Scully?!Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --How deep does this go?Are we being watched?I need your clothes, Byers.I've got to find Scully.No. But I know someone who might have an answer. Who better.What happened to Kurtzweil?Where's Scully?Is she alive?About the conspiracy?I want to know where Scully is.What is it?You're lying.A virus?This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?What do you mean, walked?That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.Why are you telling me this?What happened to Kurtzweil?Where is he?Let me out. Stop the car.How?What alien environment?What about you?Scully --Breathe -- can you breathe?!What?Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.We've got to keep moving.You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa.Yes you can.
