{"Hitchcock": {"ALFRED HITCHCOCK": {"raw_line": "Good evening.Brother has been slaying brother since Cain and Abel, yet even I did not see that coming. I was as blind-sided as poor Henry over there.Apparently the authorities shared my naivete and believed the young man's tale that Henry fell and hit his head on a stone and died of smoke asphyxiation.Of course if they hadn't believed him, Ed never would have had the opportunity to commit the heinous acts for which he became famous... and we wouldn't have our little movie. Instead, we'd have more nice, safe, predictable ones like these...Mere Technicolor baubles.Ah. A bit of doom and gloom. Now, that's more like it.No, when I was planning North by Northwest I could already hear the screams and laughter. (then, to a BEAUTIFULA pity.Talking of arrows, did you read Mr. Weiler's review in the New York Times? Apparently, he found \"the climax\" to be -- and I quote -- \"overdrawn.\"And how about this little grenade? North by Northwest reminds us of Hitchcock's earlier, more youthfully inventive spy thrillers.\" And just to drive the nail into the coffin, there's a handy accompanying guide to the new masters of suspense.Why do they keep looking for new masters of suspense when they still have the original?Tell me, dear. Am I really too old?You always know precisely where to plunge the dagger, don't you?Where are you off to?We've just established that I'm too corpulent to be seen in broad daylight.Sleeping pills with dust jackets.Very presentable.The audience would spend the entire picture waiting for Miss Frank to discover the corpse I'd hidden in the attic. Wouldn't you agree, Silvio?Doesn't she know I just made that movie? It's called North by Northwest. And \"style\" is merely self-plagiarism.I'm treading water, Peggy. I need something fresh. Something different. Without expensive stars like Cary Grant or Miss Kim Novak to pretty it up.A nice, clean, nasty little piece of work.Anything. Anything at all?Gin. Mother's ruin.Boucher says this \"Psycho\" book by Robert Bloch is `fiendishly entertaining'.And who is everyone?Is this the one based on Ed Gein, the serial killer?\"Graphic elements of brutal violence, voyeurism, transvestitism and incest.\" Certainly not your average run of the mill nutcase, is he?Peggy. This is the boy who dug up his own mother.Famished.The book or Mr. Whitfield Cook?Leave it on the night stand.Read the bit in the motel bathroom.But what if someone really good made a horror movie?Just think of the shock value. Killing off your leading lady halfway through.You're intrigued. Admit it.Peggy, I want you to summon your minions...Get them started buying copies of \"Psycho.\"All of them. I want every copy, nationwide.Have them scour every book shop and library. \"Psycho\" is my next picture, and I don't want anyone to find out the ending until they see it in the theater.That's exactly the point, my dear.And when the Wisconsin Police department raided his farmhouse in Plainview.....they opened the door only to discover - voila...... Ten female heads with the tops sawn off, a dozen masks of human skin, and a pair of lips on a drawstring for a window shade.I only wish he looked more like William Holden and less like Elmer Fudd.I was hoping everyone would. I mean life is deeply offensive and disgusting, isn't it?Try the finger sandwiches -- they're real fingers.Peggy. I'm going to need some research detailing a typical unmarried 30-year-old secretary from Phoenix, Arizona.Her monthly rent, what she wears, what she reads, which scent or perfume she prefers...I wonder how that could have happened.Don't stop looking on my behalf.But they can't stop looking, can they?Audiences want to be shocked, Barney. They want something different. And this is it.\"Psycho.\"Are you telling me \"no?\"My father ran a grocery store.They think I've lost my touch, Lew. My association with television has cheapened me.They just want the same thing over and over. They've put me in a coffin and now they're nailing down the lid.Eight hundred thousand... Give or take.What about him?Enjoy the pool now. We might not have it for that much longer.Paramount refuses to finance the movie. Imagine -- The studio that brought you Martin and Lewis and The Greatest Show On Earth considers Psycho distasteful.Lew can't find the money. Not quickly enough at least.We're going to have to go it alone, old girl. We'll finance the movie ourselves.Remember the fun we had when we started out and there was so little money and time? We took risks, we experimented. We invented new ways of making pictures because we had to.I want to feel that kind of freedom again.We've already got it, Barney.Who do I make it out to?If this picture fails, Alma, we'll be in for a long, humiliating bout of crow- eating.Are you sure?No.I must say it boggles the mind to imagine what you and your \"shrink\" could possibly talk about daily.I got Joe Stefano to write out the first few scenes. Why don't you take a look?Well?The only thing worse than a visit to the dentist is one to the censor.I assure you, Geoffrey, my murders, are always models of taste and discretion.She won't be nude. She'll be wearing a shower cap.It's completely necessary. Marion flushes evidence later found by her sister. It's a clue to the girl's disappearance.Perhaps we ought to shoot the film in France and use a bidet instead?Everyone in Hollywood resents me. I make them millions... and yet every year I sit at those dreadful award show dinners, waiting for them to say, just once, \"You're good.\"They take sadistic pleasure in denying me that one little moment.Deeply.You'll have to excuse me, doctor. I'm not used to this... process...It's just that, more and more lately, I've been having these... impulses.Strong ones.Send them all back to Glendale.Well, tell \"Swifty\" he shouldn't have overexposed his client on television.Well, Norman is the logical extension of the boys in those movies. Appealing, sensitive, suffering the terrible burden of being forced to pretend to be something he is not.How so?Try to remember this is all just make believe.Further than you can possibly imagine.I'm getting blisters just looking at you.If I could get Grace Kelly to play the girl, they'd let me get away with anything.And all the more desirable.Too... Scottish.Of course the real secret of Mrs. Simpson's appeal to the Duke of Windsor was that she could make a toothpick feel like a cigar.Now, you must try the banana shortcake.Bring her the banana shortcake, George. In fact make it two large portions.So do tell me, how else have you've prepared to play Marion?It doesn't sound silly at all. Tell me one of her deepest secrets.Allow me to put your mind at rest.May I show you some of Mr. Saul Bass's marvellous story boards?I plan to shoot quick bits of film from various angles.Cut together, this montage will suggest nudity and violence but nothing will actually be shown.And having you in the shower will make it all the more tit-illating --The gardeners only once a week and weekends off for the driver? No. Absolutely not. We'll find other places to cut.But those geese are from Barstow not Marseilles.Ed! Ed!Ed... Ed...?Am I making a mistake?What if it's another Vertigo?I've still got her under contract. I may as well get something out of it.For an utterly thankless girl.The more we frustrate them the more their interest will wane.Are you decent my dear?Perfect.It's just \"Hitch\", Tony. Hold the cock.Look at you two. America's favorite boy and girl nextdoor...That's hand-woven imported camel hair from Rodier. Don't you approve?Everyone's is. Until Alma finishes the revisions. Now hurry along, Vera. You're just in time for the oath.I solemnly promise...That I will not divulge the plot nor the many secrets of Psycho...To friends, relatives, trade reporters or columnists -- not even to outgoing President Dwight D. Eisenhower, God bless him.I don't know...Perhaps as a boy, Norman secretly watched his mother preparing for her nightly bath.Yes -- one he could access with a chair so long as he was stealthy.You're the actor. You figure it out.All the better to see you at the greatest possible angle my dear...It's just my Jesuit work ethic.The truth is... I'm only happy when I'm working...... and if I'm not working then I'm nothing. I'm not even a person. I'm just a collection of molecules. A useless cylinder of ugly flesh.My mother? Yes.She was an extraordinary person. She exposed me to Ibsen, Strindberg, Shaw. She hoped I would go into engineering -- carry a lunch pail, gold watch at fifty.To her, movie people were akin to thieves and prostitutes.If I misbehaved, she'd make me stand at the foot of her bed and discuss how I planned to become a better boy.You're a fine one to talk.You will be wearing a white bra like this for the opening scene on the bed. And then after you've stolen the money...We travel across the rooftops of downtown Phoenix and finally, through the heat, pick out a certain hotel window...We go under the blinds and match dissolve into the room itself... INT. SOUNDSTAGE, BEDROOM SET - LATERWe pan over and discover John and Janet on the bed.She'll be wearing only her undergarments and a large glow of satisfaction...Cut.I'll be right there.Was there a line at the market?Would you like a cocktail?I don't care. I was filming all day with John Gavin -- a good-looking chap but, really, plywood is more expressive. His love scene with Janet may be most horrifying thing in the picture.Even your friend Whitfield Cook would be better in the scene.Maybe I was too dismissive about your friend Whitfield's book. Perhaps he and Elizabeth could come over this weekend and he can walk me through it.Lovely woman, Elizabeth...I was hoping you could come by the set tomorrow.You think you can get away with it but you can't...... You think they can't tell... but they can. They know. It's all closing in on you. The noose is tightening...You could return the money secretly, but what would be the point?You, Marion Crane. The prim and proper girl who's always been so tight and respectable. So perfect and untouchable. Well, they know all about your dirty little secret, don't they? Your messy, sticky lunchtime trysts. Yes, your boss Mr. Lowery could even smell the sex on YOU--Circle that.What's the hold up?Fake it.Does it really require two men to carry a light stand?It's different when their pay is coming out of your own pocket.Stop trailing me like a puppy dog and get me something long, cool and wet.Give me the key!It's a wonder you can hear anything over the noise coming from the Shurlock office.Why?As you well know, Barney, my contract guarantees me final cut.Unlike the last five Martin and Lewis pictures you're all so proud of.Connect me to Maxim's of Paris.Yes, it's Alfred Hitchcock in Hollywood, California, Jean-Claude. I need three pounds of foie gras sent on the next flight out. That's correct. Three.I've been asking myself the same thing.Did you know Adolf Hitler sketched the design for this car on Ferdinand Porsche's cocktail napkin in a Berlin beer garden?It's only now that I truly appreciate just how diabolical Herr Hitler was.May I?So this is what they eat at the drive- ins...Needs must when the devil drives, my dear.I was going to make her star. But she chose the life of a housewife.I cast her as the lead in Vertigo. Then two weeks before filming she told me was pregnant.Why do they do it? Why do they always betray me?So I read your finished treatment. \"Taxi to -- \" Where was it?That's it. Dubrovnik. Care to hear my opinion?There's no other way of saying it. It's stillborn. Dead in the water.The plot's a muddle. Some of the jokes are awfully like things we already did better hundreds of years ago in The Lady Vanishes. And your villain is weak. But the biggest failure is the relationship between the hero and heroine.If you weren't so smitten with your friend Whitfield cook you'd probably see that.Women never really care to face the truth when their hearts are involved, do they?Look at this mess.Bloody belt-tightening.What's the hold-up? Call time was two hours ago.Good morning.As I explained earlier, this scene will be made up of many shots from Mr. Bass's boards. A series of looks - actions...Well, you're the professional. You'll know how to do it.Ah. There's our murderess.Are you ready for our little bloodbath?My mother used to say the same thing. Let's go for a take. Quiet everyone.Cut. More intensely. Let's go again.No. More angry. You are possessed with unbridled homicidal rage. Cut. Cut camera.Does no one understand what I'm trying to accomplish here? I'm older than anyone on this stage and I'm still standing.Give me the knife.Props. Bring in more blood.Roll camera.Print. We've got it.Not now, Ed. It's really not a good time.I've told Peggy and now I'm going to tell you. You have to get this sequence shot today. What's the hold up?No. It has to be a high angle. You'll tip off the big surprise! Just get the process shot.Burning up our money. We're two days behind and I'm stuck in bed.To the set. We can't afford to lose any more time. Two more days of this and the whole production goes under.I'd hate to take you away from your writing partner.What do you mean?We're still two days behind and sixty thousand over budget.Beware -- all men are potential murderers.With good reason.Spending a lot of time at the beach?Hardly the ideal setting to avoid distractions.I already told you -- that treatment is a waste of time.Are you and Whit having an affair?What a coincidence. I'm working on something new and I could use a little help too.Then why are you spending all hours of the day and night with some overage, talentless mamma's boy?I am under extraordinary pressures on this picture, the least you can do is give me your full support.Well, Vera. You always make it look so easy.Why didn't you stay with me? I would have made you as big a star as Grace Kelly.There was a time when I thought I understood you so completely -- understood women....What nudity? It was suggested.We did no such shot.I'll go over it frame by frame and set up another screening.What's the verdict?Don't you get lonely out here sometimes?An odd little movie. Of course, Colbert is wonderful.How was the beach?Just like Barney Balaban's face.Whit isn't worth a damn when he's not working with you. And neither am I.I didn't pull off the picture this time. It just sits there, refusing to come to life. There's no other way to say it... It's stillborn.I let you down, my love.You deserved better.I'll go and feed Geoffrey and Stanley, shall I.Except for you. INT. EDITING ROOM - NEXT DAYWe've seen the footage a thousand times. She doesn't blink.No, no, the second take, the light is better on his hands.Cut it tighter. The minute I lose one person I've lost the whole audience.Her breasts are very large, dear. It was a challenge not to show them.Absolutely not......I don't want music in the shower murder.No. This isn't Vertigo, Bernie. This is different. The images have to work on their own.It's getting there.I take your opinion very seriously. But what you think you're seeing is purely informed by the power of suggestion. I assure you that once you view the final version with Mr. Herrmann's lovely, lyrical score...Would you mind if we had a word in private, Geoffrey?I have a modest proposal to make. If you're willing to leave the shower sequence as it is, I will reshoot the opening love scene to your exact specifications.In fact, I'd welcome your personal supervision on the set.If only audiences could fully appreciate how tirelessly you work to help us entertain them while protecting them from filth and indecency.That I respected him. Deeply.Ladies and gentleman, that is a wrap. Thank you all.No need. The charade is over.See, I wasn't that much of a monster to work with, was I?Worthy of a Purple Heart, my dear.I hope you don't mind, I told Mrs. Bates she could have your dressing room.We have our seal from Shurlock's office. Now, we lead the lambs to the slaughter.Then we'd better get started. Peggy, take a memo...We're going to write a manual on exactly how to sell Psycho. INT. PRINTING PRESS - DAYMy first instruction to Theater Owners: Hire Pinkerton guards to strictly enforce our unique admission policies.Furthermore, because Psycho is so terrifying and unique, the guards can help you deal with customers who run amok.Post our special lobby clocks to remind audiences of the starting times for Psycho.The manager of this fine motion picture theater has been advised not to allow anyone to enter the theater once Psycho begins.Should you be so foolish as to attempt to slip in by a side entrance...... a fire escape or through a skylight, you will be ejected by brute force.\"To further emphasize the sheer, unrelenting shock and suspense of Psycho, right after the closing title \"THE END,\" we strongly recommend that you close your house curtains over the screen for a full thirty seconds.\"Ready for the gallows?You go on ahead.I'll join you in a minute.I want to double check the print.But they're laughing too much.I promised Mother I wouldn't tell.Have her dry-cleaned.What did he say?\"As we always knew...\"Our career, Alma.I've realized I'll never be able to find a Hitchcock blonde as beautiful as you.And that, madame, is why they call me \"The Master of Suspense\"...And so, gentle viewer, Psycho -- the picture everyone predicted would bring me to wrack and ruin -- was such a hit that Alma and I got to... Well, let's just say that we got to keep our house -- and the swimming pool. And the same critics who despised it went on to call it one of my greatest achievements.Of course for me, it was just another \"moo-vie.\"But you know what they say in Hollywood: \"You're only as good as your last picture.\" So, now, if you'll excuse me, I must toddle off to begin the exhaustive search for my next project.Unfortunately I find myself once again bereft of all inspiration. I do hope something comes along soon...Good evening.", "clean_line": "good evening brother slaying brother cain abel coming blind sided poor henry apparently authorities shared naivete believed young

much it aggravates me.Stop reading them. You've been reading them for a week now.Yes. A true relic. And lest we forget, a notably corpulent one.Right between the shoulder blades. I learned it from your pictures.I'm seeing Whit for brunch after I drop you off at the studio. Why don't you join us?You'll feel better as soon as you find a project. Hasn't Peggy unearthed any decent books yet?Well?Hurry up, darling. You're pruning.There's a story out there waiting for you somewhere, Hitch. I promise.Don't forget your lunch.Serves you right.Hitch always said your private life was in danger of being more entertaining than any of your plots.All this relentless sycophancy is giving me indigestion.What are you after?And how is your wife?Hitch is going out of his mind looking for his next project. You know how unbearable he is when he doesn't have something lined up.Almost.I'm satisfied spending time in my garden.Ah. All is finally revealed.I suppose I could give it a look.Hungry?If you're good, maybe you can have a grapefruit later.Whit gave me the galleys of his new book yesterday at lunch. I've already got some ideas on how you could adapt it.It's elegant, sophisticated, full of INTRIGUE --This might be the one, Alfred.There are calories in that, you know.Oh God.Now?\"Mary started to scream, and then the curtains parted further and a hand appeared, holding a butcher's knife. It was the knife that, a moment later, cut off her scream... and her head.\" Charming. Doris Day should do it as a musical.This is nothing but low-budget horror movie claptrap.Actually, I think it's a huge mistake.You shouldn't wait till halfway through... Kill her off after 30 minutes.You don't have to pretend you're not upset he hasn't read it yet, you know.Well, I loved it. What terrific fun it must have been to research.You're back early.I'm disappointed you didn't give Whit's book a chance.He knows you well enough.Why?Why not wait?Are we going to have to sell the entire house or just the pool?Tell me and I won't ever ask again. Why this one, Hitch? It's not just because so many people are telling you 'no,' is it?Hitch?The movie will be splendid.Of the movie? Not in the least. But of you? Unquestionably.Stop waffling, Donald. Give it to me straight.Where do you suggest we cut?We're about to have dinner. You don't need anything else.Hire him.Whatever you do, Alfred, don't lose your temper.Unlike certain people we could mention.Think of the duality he could bring to Norman. The rage lurking behind that little-boy-lost grin. The winsome charm he uses to keep from being found out.Stop grumbling. A bit of fresh air and exercise is exactly what you need.Well you can't. She's a princess now which makes her permanently unattainable.Lew suggested Deborah Kerr.What about Janet Leigh? She's always the `good girl' but she did awfully well in Touch of Evil. Lew mentioned her name. Do you remember how you always remarked on her figure at the Wassermans' parties?You're not the only one. We're fine, thank you.You and the Shurlock Office.If you'll excuse me.Oh, come off it, old girl.Hello Lillian.Don't upset yourself, darling. It's only a bloody movie.I've made a list of places where we can tighten our belt.It wouldn't hurt for us all to learn the art of self restraint.There aren't any other places. And furthermore, they'll be no more shipments from Maxim's either. We can't afford it.The foie gras at Chasen's is more than adequate.We all have to make our little sacrifices for the greater good, don't we, Alfred?Oh, shut up. Just get the first take under your belt you'll be fine.The people who matter know. That's all that counts.Whit.I've been doing the revisions on...In a state of unbridled ecstacy now that he's back on the set.Not bad. I've got eight hundred words to do for Reader's Digest on what it's like to be married to a man obsessed by murder.No. Actually, I'm back sooner than I expected.No. And you shouldn't either.Those haven't been washed yet.You should tell Whit that. He'd be flattered.I'll see how my day shapes up.What would I do without you?What did you forget now?Whit? Is that you?It's so nice not to have to take care of someone, even if it's just for an hour or two.Whit, where are we going? You still haven't told me.A surprise. How fun.I don't mind that he uses his obsession to fuel his art. I just don't like it when he uses it against me.Did you know when we started out I was his boss? He didn't even dare ask me out until he'd worked his way up to assistant director.Looks nice. Terrific location. Why?I just saw Elizabeth. Why on earth didn't she tell me?Very Bohemian.Whit. I hope you haven't got the wrong idea.Dubrovnik.Yes. Naturally.How so?How would you know what really goes on between a man and a woman?Forget what Hitch said. He's just feeling his age. He'll come around.So why don't we put some in?All we need is a better catalyst. Some innocuous little trigger to release all that underlying desire.Even better, what if they reached for the cab door at exactly the same time?That way, we could start close on the hands... ... and then tilt up to the eyes.Are you going to get that?No more phone calls. You're burning up.Where do you think you're going?You stay in bed. I'll deal with it.Under the blankets. Now.Don't stop work because of me. I'm only here as one of the two people paying your salaries.Scene?Storyboards?Start with the overhead. We'll cut before the fall. Then we'll put Martin in a chair under the camera.And that lens should be a thirty-five.Barney.That won't be necessary.Thank you for your concern, Barney.But on a Hitchcock picture, there is only one director.That's kind of you.Janet, you've been very... professional. It hasn't gone unappreciated.May I turn that down?You'll be pleased to know order has been restored.A thank you would be nice.I already cancelled the wrap party. That'll save us two thousand right there. And you won't be tempted by any champagne and cake.Alright, what's this about?That's where Whit and I are writing. He's rented a place.Actually, it's very conducive to creative collaboration.Didn't everyone say the same thing about \"Psycho\"?Don't be absurd. He's working on something new and needs a little help, that's all.What do you think I've been doing?Because it's fun.Full support? We've mortgaged our house. My house.Might I remind you that I have weighed-in on every aspect of this film so far, as I have done on every picture you've done in the last three decades. And the first time you show the film, it will be my notes that you want. I celebrate with you if the reviews are good and I cry for you if they are not. I host your parties and put up with those fantasy romances with your leading ladies. And when you're out promoting this film around the world, I will stand beside or, rather, slightly behind you, smiling endlessly for the press even when I'm ready to drop, being gracious to people who look through me as if I were invisible because all they can see is the grand and glorious \"Alfred Hitchcock.\"Now, for the first time in years, I dare to work on something that isn't \"an Alfred Hitchcock Production\" and I'm met with accusation and criticisms. This work I'm doing with Whit gives me pleasure and purpose.And even though that takes absolutely nothing away from you, please consider this a reminder: I am your wife, Alma Reville, not one of the contract blondes you badger and torment with your oh-so- specific direction.I thought you rented this place so we could write.Don't worry. I won't tell Elizabeth.Oh, I wouldn't worry about that, Whit.Is there anything else we can do?Well, it is only a house.Cold and miserable.I don't think I can stand both of us being maudlin.There is one solution to all this, you know.We could both get to work -- together.That tiresome little Hitchcock imitation I've been helping Whit finish is done.So I suggest, for everyone's sake, we start whipping Psycho into shape tomorrow. You may not be the easiest man to live with but you know how to cut a picture better than anyone.You'll need to cut those six or seven frames where she blinks after she's supposed to be dead.Take thirty frames off the head...Only cut back to Janet once the car's already moving.You imp. You got nudity in there.You can't scare people just by going, \"Boo!\" You have to tell them what's coming, make them anticipate it --More playful, darling.Well, at least there are some people here.Are you sure?Fine, darling. I'll save you a seat.This could be the biggest hit of your career, Alfred.You do realize I've been waiting decades to hear you say that.", "clean_line": "muhammad eyes peeping toms gouged arrows doubt mr weiler climax years maudlin know aggravates stop reading ve reading week yes true relic lest forget notably corpulent right shoulder blades learned pictures seeing whit brunch drop studio join ll feel better soon project hasn peggy unearthed decent books hurry darling pruning story waiting hitch promise forget lunch serves right hitch said private life danger entertaining plots relentless sycophancy giving indigestion wife hitch going mind looking project know unbearable lined satisfied spending time garden ah finally revealed suppose look hungry good maybe grapefruit later whit gave galleys new book yesterday lunch ve got ideas adapt elegant sophisticated intrigue alfred calories know oh god mary started scream curtains parted hand appeared holding butcher knife knife moment later cut scream head charming doris day musical low budget horror movie claptrap actually think huge mistake shouldn wait till halfway kill minutes pretend upset hasn read know loved terrific fun research early disappointed whit book chance knows wait going sell entire house pool tell won ask hitch people telling hitch movie splendid movie unquestionably stop waffling donald straight suggest cut dinner need hire alfred lose temper unlike certain people mention think duality bring norman rage lurking little boy lost grin winsome charm uses stop grumbling bit fresh air exercise exactly need princess makes permanently unattainable lew suggested deborah kerr janet leigh good girl awfully touch evil lew mentioned remember remarked figure wassermans parties fine thank shurlock office ll excuse oh come old girl hello lillian upset darling bloody movie ve list places tighten belt wouldn hurt learn art self restraint aren places furthermore ll shipments maxim afford foie gras chasen adequate little sacrifices greater good alfred oh shut belt ll fine people matter know counts whit ve revisions state unbridled ecstacy set bad ve got words reader digest like married man obsessed murder actually sooner expected shouldn haven washed tell whit flattered ll day shapes forget whit nice care hour whit going haven told surprise fun mind uses obsession fuel art like uses know started boss dare ask worked way assistant director looks nice terrific location saw elizabeth earth tell bohemian whit hope haven got wrong idea dubrovnik yes naturally know goes man woman forget hitch said feeling age ll come need better catalyst innocuous little trigger release underlying desire better reached cab door exactly time way start close hands tilt eyes going phone calls burning think going stay bed ll deal blankets stop work people paying salaries scene storyboards start overhead ll cut fall ll martin chair camera lens thirty barney won necessary thank concern barney hitchcock picture director kind janet ve professional hasn gone unappreciated turn ll pleased know order restored thank nice cancelled wrap party ll save thousand right won tempted champagne cake alright whit writing rented place actually conducive creative collaboration thing psycho absurd working new needs little help think ve fun support ve mortgaged house house remind weighed aspect film far picture ve decades time film notes want celebrate reviews good host parties fantasy romances leading ladies promoting film world stand slightly smiling endlessly press ready drop gracious people look invisible grand glorious alfred hitchcock time years dare work isn alfred hitchcock production met accusation criticisms work whit gives pleasure purpose takes absolutely away consider reminder wife alma reville contract blondes badger torment oh specific direction thought rented place write worry won tell elizabeth oh wouldn worry whit house cold miserable think stand maudlin solution know work tiresome little hitchcock imitation ve helping whit finish suggest sake start whipping psycho shape tomorrow easiest man live know cut picture better ll need cut seven frames blinks supposed dead thirty frames head cut janet car moving imp got nudity scare people going boo tell coming anticipate playful darling people sure fine darling ll save seat biggest hit career alfred realize ve waiting decades hear"}, "WHITFIELD COOK": {"raw_line": "...

What are you working on?That is one lucky garden.Actually, I was hoping you might be able to apply your considerable pruning skills to this.The most fun I ever had was working with you.Now, if this were a Hitchcock picture what would two characters like us, married to other people, be saying?I'm a big boy. I can take it.Certainly more fun than reading those reviews.Do you think he really will read it?Speak of the devil.I have to admit, Hitch, I ran all over town looking for a copy of \"Psycho\" but couldn't find a single one.You girls go on ahead.Hello, stranger.Where have you been hiding yourself?Psycho. And how is the old boy?And you? How are you?I've got a better idea.Why don't we drive out to Santa Barbara? We'll have Emilio fry up those juicy steaks we like at El Encanto.No shoptalk ... No silly magazine articles...just a wonderful meal...Well, I think that sounds like a fabulous idea. We'll have a late lunch. I'll make the reservation for one thirty.Till then, bye.Those steaks haven't changed at all, have they?I have a little surprise.He's like any great artist.

It does need more feeling.What if Helen and Michael try and get into the cab at the same time?That feels better already.Hullo?... Yes... Hold on.It's for you.Alma, I thought you were coming later tonight.I did. I swear -- this just happened.You won't say anything, will you?I mean to Hitch.We can't all be geniuses.Alma -- you're incredibly talented.
