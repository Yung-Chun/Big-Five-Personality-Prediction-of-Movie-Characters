Landing is launching.Okay, landing, landing, landing is green.Okay, okay landing, alright.Soft landing jets trigger automatically at three meters before landing. ... you're a clever son of a bitch Matt. So to land I need to get rid of the BO and Engine module, okay?Listen to me Matt. You're going to see a girl with brown hair. She's Sarah, her hair is probably a mess. That's okay, she doesn't like to brush it.Tell her mommy found her red shoe. She was so upset about that shoe Matt, but tell her it was right under the bed.You give her a big hug and a kiss for me and tell her mamma misses her. Tell her she's my little angel and that she makes me so proud, so so so proud, and that I promise I'll try and make her proud too. You tell her that I'm not quitting, that I'm going to keep fighting. You tell her I love her Matt... I love her so much.Tri module separation, go...Okay Houston, here comes the tricky part, the Soyuz has to think we're only three meters above the earth.Let's reset you then.Okay. I only have one shot at this. One shot...What's the point if we don't try?Wow... you were right Matt... it's magnificent....You're losing altitude, Tiangong. You keep dropping and you're going to kiss the atmosphere. But not before I get to you. You have my last ride home.Okay, I'm done with just driving. Let's get go home.Ahhhhhh!Come on.

It was '96. I'd been up here 42 days. Every time I passed over Texas, I'd look down, knowing the second Mrs Kowalsky, was looking up, thinking of me. Six weeks I'm blowing kisses to that woman. Then we land at Edwards and I find out she'd run off with a lawyer before I was off the launch pad, so I packed my car and I headed to...Five hours off the reservation and I show 30% drain. My compliments to Engineering. Except for a slight malfunction on the nulling of the roll axis, this jetpack is one prime piece of thrust.Tell them I still prefer my '67 Corvette though. Speaking of which did I ever tell you the--Even Engineering?He appears to be doing the Macarena of some sort. Though that would merely be a best guess scenario on my part.Not a problem.Seventy-five minutes shy. Never crossed my mind.Right back atcha, Houston.Am I a go to assist Dr. Stone in removing the panel?Thank you, Houston. Mind if I join the fun?How are you feeling?It's been a rough week. If it makes you feel any better, I puked up everything but my kidneys on my first ride.Hey -- you're the genius up here. I just drive this bus.Let the boys down there worry for us.So doc, now that you work for NASA, how do you like it?How long was your training?So, what is this scanning system?Listen, they don't bankroll prototypes, even for your pretty blue eyes.Right now your eyes are blood shut.And to think he went to Harvard.You gotta admit one thing. You can't beat the view....\"Mmm?\" So what do you like about being up here?Hmmmm. Terrific.Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission.It's the same feeling I had at Mardi Gras in 1987...?Well, it's day one and I'm bumping my way down Bourbon Street looking for the sister of a friend of mine. The streets are swimming with people, I'm thinking there's no way I'm finding this girl...Then all of a sudden I look up and -- there she is.I am about to yell out when I notice she's holding hands with a short hairy guy in board shorts and a Margaritaville T-shirt. Then I realize, the guy's no guy. My sister's friend is holding hands with a--Roger. Explorer, prep airlock!Houston. Elaborate.Copy all Houston. Put a bow on it Dr. Stone.I'm not going to ask you again.Not one second. Now! Shut it down! THAT'S AN ORDER!!!Alright Shariff, let's do this.Houston. Update.Right of disposal. Most likely a spy sat gone bad. Now it's space junk.Explorer, ready to disengage HST.What's the blowback, Houston?Define \"multiple\" sats.Half of North America just lost their Facebook.Explorer, this is Kowalsky. Confirming visual contact with debris. Debris is from a BSE sat. To repeat--To repeat I have-We have to go. Go, go! Go!Explorer permission to retrieve Dr. Stone.Unstrap! You can't tune out the world up here.Try releasing the safety clip.No, don't wait for us. Get inside.Man down! Man down!Disengage!!!Explorer has been hit. Explorer do you read? Explorer, over. Explorer--Astronaut off structure! Dr. Stone is off structure!Dr. Stone, detach!You must detach!If you don't detach that arm is going to carry you too far!Listen to my voice. You need to focus. I'm losing visual of you. In a few seconds I won't be able to track you.You need to detach. I can't see you anymore.Do it. Now!Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone... Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone.Dr. Stone! Do you copy?! Repeat! Do you copy?...Give me your position!Report your position.Give me a visual.Do you have a visual of Explorer?Do you have a visual of ISS?I need you to focus. Give me a visual... anything.... Stone. Do you copy?Repeat. Do you copy?Flash your light.So I can see you.There you are. Hang tight. Report your status.Your status! Give me your readings?Your O2. Give me your O2.You're breathing too fast. You're burning oxygen. We don't want to do that. We want to relax. Copy.Nearly there.You can holster that torch, Dr. Stone.Gotcha.Now, I'm going to tether you to me. Ryan is paralyzed, holding onto Matt tightly and looking at him in fright. He stares back.I know. You never realized how devastatingly good-looking I am.But I need you to stop staring and help me with the tether. Okay?Ok. So far so good. Now listen. I'm going to give you a little push, just so you're clear of the jets--Sorry. Not a push, more like a nudge.See? Where you go, I go.Better. Let's get out of here. Using his thrusters, Matt negotiates a new position and, igniting a long thrust, he jets away.I know what you mean.You're burning oxygen, we're going to go back to the shuttle. How's that for a plan. Copy?Right copy that.Houston in the blind, this is Kowalsky. Dr Stone and I are making our way to base, please prepare Airlock for arrival. Copy?Houston this is Kowalsky. How do you copy?It seems like communications are lost.We don't know. That's why we keep talking. If someone is listening they might just save your life. Set your watch for ninety minutes.Houston clocked that debris at fifty thousand miles per hour. Factoring in our current orbit, I reckon we've got 90 minutes before we play duck and cover again.Okay. Pretty scary shit being untethered up here, isn't it?You did all right.Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalsky. Our current location is approximately 900 meters out from the Explorer. Dr. Stone and I would like to retrieve the body of Mission Specialist Shariff and return it to Shuttle. Am I a go to retrieve?Roger that.Grab him!Quick. You're pulling me away.Clutch him like he's your Valentine. I can't gauge my thrust with you two yo- yoing around.Jesus...Here's hoping you've got one monster insurance policy, Houston. Damages to Explorer are... it's totaled. Will commence search for survivors.All right, here we go. Careful of the edges.Houston, in the blind. To confirm. Mission Specialist Dr. Stone and myself, Mission Commander Matthew Kowalsky, are the sole survivors of STS-157.We were going to be hit no matter what. There was nothing you could've done to change that.Hey.Alright... We have to get ourselves to the Space Station. There.It's a bit of a hike, but it's our only... It's our best option. Agreed?Dr. Stone... Agreed?Alright. After you.Houston in the blind, this is Kowalsky. Dr. Stone and I have determined to proceed to ISS and use one of their Soyuz for re-entry. ISS if copy, please send rescue mission. Repeat please dispatch rescue mission.We're getting there.Beautiful, don't you think?The sunrise. That's what I'm going to miss the most.So, where's home, Dr. Stone?Ryan. Where's home?Ah ha. Down there. Mother Earth. Where do you pitch your tent?Where the hell is that?Illinois. Central time zone. That makes it roughly... 8pm right now. What are the good people of Lake Zurich doing at 8 o'clock in the evening?What would you be doing?Come on. It's 8 o'clock. You've just clocked out of the hospital after putting in your customary 18-hour shift. You're driving home...There we go. Let me guess. NPR? Classical. Top for--What do you miss down there?Is there a Mr. Stone?Nobody special? Someone down there, looking up, thinking of you?What was her name?Well, well, what d'you know. I have good news and bad news.The good news is we're five minutes from the ISS and I know where the Russians stash their vodka... and that's a good thing cus I'm running out of fumes. Bad news is I'm gonna be ten minutes short of......breaking Anatoly's record.What?The tank may be empty but there's still oxygen in your suit, so sip, Ryan. Don't gulp. It's wine, not beer. Sip. We'll get you there.Let's go.Houston in the blind we have visual of the ISS. Station must have been evacuated because first Soyuz is missing. Second Soyuz exhibits surface damage and chute has deployed. It's use as escape pod for re-entry to Earth is impossible.Sip, Ryan. Sip. Drifting is good. We want to drift. I wasn't kidding about those fumes. This can has one or two good thrusts left. If we're lucky....Steady...Ready... aim......fire.I can't. Can's empty. We're coming in fast and we're going to hit hard. Grab onto anything you can and hold tight!Grab a hold. Grab anything.Give me... give me five here, Ryan.Shit... shit...You have to let me go.You have to.Those ropes are too loose, I'm pulling you with me. You have to let me go or we both die--Ryan!It's not up to you.You're going to make it Ryan.Ryan do you copy? Do you copy?You need to board the station. Can you see the airlock?Good. That's where you want to go. You're losing focus, right?That's because you're breathing CO2 and you're losing consciousness. You need to board the Station.Move!Now listen to me. That second Soyuz is too damaged for re-entry, but it's perfectly fine for a little Sunday drive.Look to the west... You see that dot in the distance? That is the Chinese Station. You're going to take the Soyuz and cruise over there. The Chinese lifeboat is a Shenzou.That doesn't matter. Its re-entry protocol is identical to the Soyuz's--You've never flown a Soyuz either.So then you know.It's a Simulator. That's what it's designed for.It's not rocket science. Just point the damn thing at earth and by this time tomorrow you'll be back in Lake Zurich with one hell of a story to tell. You copy? Ryan. You copy?No you're not. . I have too much of a head start. That ship already sailed.Ryan, you're going to have to learn to let go.I want to hear you say you're going to make it.Ryan! Say it!Alright. Keep goingWhat kind of name is Ryan for a girl?Are you close to the airlock?Keep going.So, now that we have some distance between us- you're attracted to me, aren't you?Well, people say I have beautiful blue eyes.I have brown eyes... that hurts.You wanna know the good news?I'm going to break Anatoly's record, and I think mine's going to stand for a long, long time.You know, Ryan is a nice name for a girl. Wow, you should see the sun on the Ganges. It's amazing.Ahhhh! Alright, check your watch. 13 hours, 11 minutes. Call Anatoly, tell him he's been bumped.Bit gloomy in here. How `bout a little light?Trust me, it's a hell of a story.That's better.I found a little extra battery power. I'm just happy you're still alive. To be honest, I thought your chances were slim to none. By the way, did you find the vodka?Oh well... To Anatoly! Na zdorovje.No? Right, let's get out of here.We're `bout a hundred miles to the Chinese Station. A little Sunday drive.Course we can.Well, there's always something we can do.Did you try the soft landing jets?Well landing is launching it's the same thing, didn't you learn about that in training?But you know about it.Listen you want to go back or do you want to stay here? I get it, it's nice up here, you can just shut down all the systems turn out all the lights, and just close your eyes and tune out everybody.There's nobody up here who can hurt you, it's safe. Then what's the point in going on, what's the point of living?Your kid died, doesn't get any rougher than that, but still it's a matter of what you do now. If you decide to go that you've gotta just get on with it, sit back enjoy the ride. You have to start living life, Ryan.Ryan, you have to learn to let go ...
