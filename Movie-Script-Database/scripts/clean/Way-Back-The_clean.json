{"Way-Back-The": {"SMITH": {"raw_line": "I'm an old man. But I'll be alive in the morning. He won't. He goes to move away, hesitates, turns back to JANUSZ.'Kindness'. That can kill you here. You'll learn that. He places the last morsel of bread in his mouth, and chewing slowly, turns and walks away.We need to make shelter.We'll freeze to death in less than an hour.Yes, but lose 200 men and you'll have some forms to fill out. Could go badly for you. The GUARD dimly considers this. The prisoners begin to stir, some shouting out that they should turn back. The GUARD alarmed, orders the prisoners to the ground - other guards level their rifles as the mass of men lay down on the freezing ground. All but SMITH.We could move into the forest, find shelter!Smith.Mister.That's right. As the blizzard grows in intensity, JANUSZ reaches into his pocket for strips of pine-bark collected earlier. He hands them out to his companions. They watch as he chews on the bark. The others follow his example. Watching from a short distance away is GUARD NO. 1. He takes note of the group as future troublemakers.Might as well have shot us yesterday. JANUSZ and the others look at him.We're for the mine.Are you crazy? They'll shoot you.What can be done?Who?The actor.He has no intention of escaping.He's aliar. Been here foryears -seeksout new arrivals, mewhen Ifirstcame here. He justlikes totalkabout escape. I'veknown others like him.Nothing is for nothing in the camps. From you he gets your energy, your spirit. You feed his 'dream' of escape. You help keep him alive. He's no more than a leech.Can't be done alone. Besides you have a weakness that could be useful to me.Compassion. If anything happens to me, I'm counting on you carrying me. JANUSZ knows he's not joking.We've got to make fire!We die either way, might as well die warm.You've made a bargain with the Devil.You should be grateful you're here at all.Barbed-wire. ZORAN puzzled, but TOMASZ gets it.Then you'll die. KAZIK has a far-away look in his sight-less eyes. He speaks in Polish to JANUSZ.Save your philosophy. Concentrate on keeping up with us instead. He gets up and goes in search of more wood, the others surprised at his cold tone. The rest of the group also begin to prepare their camp. Most gather wood while TOMASZ, the 'quartermaster', makes their meal, and JANUSZ the fire. VOSS keeps an eye on KAZIK who, demonstrating his independence while it's still light, and his desire to contribute, returns with a load of wood, turning back into the forest for more. Others gather wood, and as the light fades, begin to take up positions by the growing fire, roll cigarettes, etc. VOSS looks anxiously for KAZIK. He has not returned.Lived in the woods a while.In America.I made a mistake.I know. Valka.Good luck. As JANUSZ heads off into the forest.What's the 'brick'?Something about a loose brick. JANUSZ nods, offers no explanation.You know if you don't pull through soon we'll have to leave you.So you better get better quick if you want to see home again.We're being followed.Fifty yards back. A man on his own. May have seen us - crossed into the trees beside the track. A silence as they consider their options. VALKA draws his knife.He gives us away, the soldiers will be on us in no time.What? What is it?She wants to travel with us?We can't feed ourselves.We have no choice. JANUSZ knows this is true.That right.Speak to Valka about her. He doesn't even think she's Polish.It's decided then?Apart from food she'll slow us down. There's no room for sentimentality. You know that.Can you swim?You wouldn't lie to me?And don't call me, 'comrade'. With a shout the group plunge into the icy water, swimming one-handed, their packs held above water level in the other. It's only when they reach the other side they realize IRENA is still on the opposite bank. The others urge her to swim across. She hesitates a moment then runs upstream to where the river is frozen.Janusz tells me your family were Kulaks?Were your parents arrested with you?You can't swim can you? She looks up at him.You've never been in the water in your life. She laughs coquettishly.And, you said you lived on a farm near Warsaw? IRENA puzzled.The Soviets didn't get that far. That was German territory. She nervously swats the mosquitos.Your parents weren't murdered were they? You made it all up. pinched, She won't look at him, her face looks thin and she seems older.We've all done terrible things to survive. But don't ever lie to me again. We've had enough of lies.We're wasting time. He strikes off up a slope toward the hills behind the town.He was behind Zoran.He could turn us in for the bounty.He'd bribe his way out of it.Could have got us all killed.Fool! He releases him and VALKA staggers back, reaching down to a bulging sack. He tips out the contents - various foodstuffs including a freshly killed rabbit and a bottle of vodka.What can we do? Steal a boat?People are going to get ill.After all we've faced, how strange, these tiny insects might defeat us.Is that right?Well, I'll be damned. Never knew a funny accountant.In the camps you learn to say as little as possible. They walk on in silence, IRENA sneaking a look up at him.We don't have a choice.Love it later. We need to get as far from this border as possible. ZORAN faces Russia and as if bowing at the end of a performance.This changes everything. IRENA looks at the grassy plains all about them.There's a war on with the Japanese, I know that much.The Himalayas.Yes.No. American. The OLD MAN maybe doesn't get the 'American' part, but he gets that they are not Russian. He seems pleased about that.Lhasa. Yes. Tibet. JANUSZ points South.Yes.We are too poor to have horses. The OLD MAN points at IRENA.Daughter. IRENA moves closer to him. SMITH puts a protective arm about her shoulder. The OLD MAN considers the situation for a moment longer before abruptly turning, and followed by his band, galloping off toward the distant hills. Looks between the group, not exactly of relief, as there's a feeling it may not be the last they see of the riders. IRENA looks up at SMITH, smiles at him. Something about him calling her his daughter has touched some hidden place. SMITH, a little embarrassed, smiles back.What about water?I don't see any. I'm trying to remember my school geography but I seem to recall the Gobi Desert somewhere in Southern Mongolia. JANUSZ begins scooping out a hole in the pebbly ground. It's funnel-shaped, narrow at the base. The others watch as he lines the sides with dried deerskin, placing their cooking pot in the base.Janusz? JANUSZ follows him to the rise. SMITH points to his discovery. JANUSZ squints against the light.We have no more water. I see trees. Where there's trees there's water.I've never doubted you, Janusz. Not once. But we must give it a try.Damn it, we're already dying. JANUSZ goes to move on, SMITH grabs his shirt sleeve, a short pathetic struggle sees them fall to their knees, VOSS and TOMASZ move to separate them. SMITH is the first to stand, brushing sand and dirt from his clothes. He turns to the others.You have a choice. He looks at IRENA, then turns and goes back for his staff and jacket. The others watch as he turns East toward his discovery.Just a little. Don't fill yourselves. More scoops follow in quick succession, enough to splash hands and faces. VOSS calls from a few yards away.Lots of tracks. Nomads?What are you looking at me for? Ask Janusz. He's already made up his mind for us, haven't you, Janusz? JANUSZ says nothing.We're in trouble.They know.Days?What about what we're getting from condensation?Can you get us back to the waterhole?You caught her smile. SMITH passes the sketch to JANUSZ as TOMASZ lays back down, a smile on his face. He looks up at the stars. He knows he's dying and has accepted the fact. This in turn has given strength to his friends, and between them all is a feeling of love and a kind of peace.They also fly long distances.It can kill you, remember? JANUSZ puzzled.'Kindness'. JANUSZ tries to force more water on him but SMITH waives him away.How long can you survive on snakes and mud? You should leave me, but you can't can you? You're a fool. I'd leave you. He lays back down. JANUSZ studies his face, pain and suffering etched in sharp lines.What?Irena told you. JANUSZ nods.Saying his name on't bring him back. He struggles onto his elbow, staring intently at JANUSZ, an ironic smile on his lips.You trying to give me the will to live? That it? Stop me giving up?In the camps, some saw death as 'freedom'.Survival was a kind of protest. JANUSZ makes him take a little water.Now being alive is my punishment.I brought David to Russia didn'tBe easier if I had religion, or a home to go back to, like you.Irena told me they tortured your wife and she informed on you.They did that to my boy.Tibetan? They move on with renewed energy.And food?I'm going to Lhasa. The others are stunned by this.The Lama has a contact - maybe get me out through China. There's a U.S. military mission there. They don't like it. A feeling he's deserting them, breaking up the team.Zoran? ZORAN eventually looks at him.We escaped. We made it. VOSS blows out the lamp. Silvery moonlight from a small window.'Home'?Might drift for a while.And you, Janusz?", "clean_line": "old man ll alive morning won goes away hesitates turns janusz kindness kill ll learn places morsel bread mouth chewing slowly turns walks away need shelter ll freeze death hour yes lose men ll forms badly guard dimly considers prisoners begin stir shouting turn guard alarmed orders prisoners ground guards level rifles mass men lay freezing ground smith forest shelter smith mister right blizzard grows intensity janusz reaches pocket strips pine bark collected earlier hands companions watch chews bark follow example watching short distance away guard takes note group future troublemakers shot yesterday janusz look crazy ll shoot actor intention escaping aliar foryears seeksout new arrivals mewhen ifirstcame justlikes totalkabout escape veknown like camps gets energy spirit feed dream escape help alive leech weakness useful compassion happens counting carrying janusz knows joking ve got die way die warm ve bargain devil grateful barbed wire zoran puzzled tomasz gets ll die kazik far away look sight eyes speaks polish janusz save philosophy concentrate keeping instead gets goes search wood surprised cold tone rest group begin prepare camp gather wood tomasz quartermaster makes meal janusz voss keeps eye kazik demonstrating independence light desire contribute returns load wood turning forest gather wood light fades begin positions growing roll cigarettes voss looks anxiously kazik returned lived woods america mistake know valka good luck janusz heads forest brick loose brick janusz nods offers explanation know pull soon ll leave better better quick want home followed yards man seen crossed trees track silence consider options valka draws knife gives away soldiers time wants travel feed choice janusz knows true right speak valka think polish decided apart food ll slow room sentimentality know swim wouldn lie comrade shout group plunge icy water swimming handed packs held water level reach realize irena opposite bank urge swim hesitates moment runs upstream river frozen janusz tells family kulaks parents arrested swim looks ve water life laughs coquettishly said lived farm near warsaw irena puzzled soviets far german territory nervously swats mosquitos parents weren murdered pinched won look face looks older ve terrible things survive lie ve lies wasting time strikes slope hills town zoran turn bounty bribe way got killed fool releases valka staggers reaching bulging sack tips contents foodstuffs including freshly killed rabbit bottle vodka steal boat people going ill ve faced strange tiny insects defeat right ll damned knew funny accountant camps learn little possible walk silence irena sneaking look choice love later need far border possible zoran faces russia bowing end performance changes irena looks grassy plains war japanese know himalayas yes american old man maybe american gets russian pleased lhasa yes tibet janusz points south yes poor horses old man points irena daughter irena moves closer smith puts protective arm shoulder old man considers situation moment longer abruptly turning followed band galloping distant hills looks group exactly relief feeling riders irena looks smith smiles calling daughter touched hidden place smith little embarrassed smiles water trying remember school geography recall gobi desert southern mongolia janusz begins scooping hole pebbly ground funnel shaped narrow base watch lines sides dried deerskin placing cooking pot base janusz janusz follows rise smith points discovery janusz squints light water trees trees water ve doubted janusz try damn dying janusz goes smith grabs shirt sleeve short pathetic struggle sees fall knees voss tomasz separate smith stand brushing sand dirt clothes turns choice looks irena turns goes staff jacket watch turns east discovery little scoops follow quick succession splash hands faces voss calls yards away lots tracks nomads looking ask janusz mind haven janusz janusz says trouble know days getting condensation waterhole caught smile smith passes sketch janusz tomasz lays smile face looks stars knows dying accepted fact turn given strength friends feeling love kind peace fly long distances kill remember janusz puzzled kindness janusz tries force water smith waives away long survive snakes mud leave fool leave lays janusz studies face pain suffering etched sharp lines irena told janusz nods saying bring struggles elbow staring intently janusz ironic smile lips trying live stop giving camps saw death freedom survival kind protest janusz makes little water alive punishment brought david russia tbe easier religion home like irena told tortured wife informed boy tibetan renewed energy food going lhasa stunned lama contact maybe china military mission like feeling deserting breaking team zoran zoran eventually looks escaped voss blows lamp silvery moonlight small window home drift janusz"}, "JANUSZ": {"raw_line": "American? He looks back to SMITH walking away toward the barracks.Yes, I am.Weiszczek, Janusz.That's what they told me.Twenty. KHABAROV indicates himself.How could we know Russia would stab us in the back?I wouldn't sign, so they tortured someone else.Why?You got ten years for a performance in a film?Who are they?Why would they let them 'run things'?And do any ever wriggle out of the net? KHABAROV considers a moment, then leads him away from the surrounding prisoners. He lowers his voice to a whisper.And how long have you been here?No-one could meet that quota even if they were fed and rested. KHABAROV calls for them to follow him. He leads them at a jog deeper into the trees - pointing out various shapes buried in fallen leaves and drifts of snow. He clears away the leaves and snow to reveal a pile of old grey cut timber.He knows. KHABAROV shrugs.We're going to leave them here overnight? Why?They marched as due North from the railway, I glimpsed a lake, but I have no idea where we are. KHABAROV squats down, JANUSZ joins him, and smoothing out a drift of snow KHABAROV sketches a map of a lake and indicates the location of the camp.We could follow the edge of the Lake, it runs due South.Why wait?What about my friends?But they'd die free men. KHABAROV offers his hand, and they shake.And you're ?Your first name?Mister Smith?Got to get out! SMITH stares at him. He's delirious and begins to shake with cold. SMITH grabs his shoulder and drags him back to where the POINT'-MAN works, thrusting JANUSZ's hands around the pipe. The POINT-MAN waves them away but SMITH bribes him with a slice of bread. SMITH turns back to JANUSZ - the warmth of the pipe beginning to have its effect.It can be done.He knows a way through the wire. SMITH slaps a hand over his mouth, glancing at the Point- Man, before dragging JANUSZ further away.His name is Khabarov. Now SMITH understands.You know him?What?Why should I believe you?You're a cold bastard, Mister.I thought you were a loner?And what's that?Tonight. KHABAROV looks from the footprints to JANUSZ, a horrified look on his face.It'll do, it'll cover our tracks.We've been trading, the American is with us. He has food, you have food.I've spent half my life in the woods and mountains. We'll live off the land.How do we get through the wire?Your friend, Lazar, he knows doesn't he? A look of fear crosses KHABAROV's face. Someone behind JANUSZ. JANUSZ turns. VALKA, a few paces away watching them. KHABAROV scuttles back inside the barracks. JANUSZ hesitates a moment, then follows.What do you want?Get up. Or we die right now. You know how fast dogs travel. He turns to the others.Run, damn you! Run! He moves to SMITH.Is it time for me to carry you?Knife . VALKA has never taken an order from a 'Political' in his short life.Your knife. With a glance to the others he reluctantly draws his knife from his boot and passes it to JANUSZ. While the group furiously dig, JANUSZ collects and trims fallen timber. As the hole deepens, JANUSZ begins to make a trellis roof. The voices change direction. They go still. Are they surrounded? They resume their digging with greater intensity, the hole now more than a meter at its deepest, JANUSZ placing the branches to cover their hide.No! You saw how close they were! KAZIK sinks to the snow, then ZORAN.Snow, falling from trees. They relax a little.When I say.Twenty, thirty kilometers.Something like that. He spreads out a piece of cloth on the snow at his feet.Alright, let's see what you've got. No one moves. JANUSZ reaches into his own pockets, emptying the contents onto the cloth - several slices of bread, half a kilo of buckwheat, some dried meat, a swatch of tobacco. SMITH goes next with a larger store of bread and a little salt. VOSS has a collection of small fish-heads which he adds to the store. TOMASZ, KAZIK and ZORAN make their contributions. They stare grimly at their limited food supply. Various other items are added - a razor blade, a length of cord, a piece of barbed-wire, etc. SMITH picks up the barbed wire, examines it.Valka? VALKA reluctantly reaches into his coat - something familiar about it with its distinctive fur-lined collar.That's Khabarov's coat.We share. JANUSZ reaches out for the sack of food. VALKA glances at the others, then passes it to him. TOMASZ has already begun to organize seven slices of bread laying one of VOSS's fish heads on each. one. He hands them out. They eat in silence, savoring every bite. ZORAN removes the fish-head, passing it back to TOMASZ. Then he places a thin layer of snow on the bread like a canape. He eats daintily, his little finger extended like a dowager at a tea party, raising a smile from his exhausted companions.Wolves it's only wolves.South! To Lake Baikal! Cheers from the watching group.Now we travel by day. They move off down toward a distant valley, ZORAN the last to leave, doubt on his face as he studies the series of seemingly endless forested hills stretching before them.What's 'Pakhan'?We're not criminals, we're escaping from criminals.You want to be my bodyguard?I have us here somewhere. Above Lake Baikal their former camp is marked. South of the lake, the Trans-Siberian Railway, a little further South the Russo/Mongolian border. With a twig he points to a spot seemingly not far from the prison camp. WIDER to see the disappointed faces of the group - the distance yet to cover overwhelming.We'll be moving too fast to wait for traps.There's a bounty on our heads.It's how we'll survive isn't it, Mister?A free man died here today. Amens are muttered. The group remain by the grave reluctant to leave. All but VALKA who looks about restlessly.You mean the first to die? VALKA nods, indicates TOMASZ.It might be you. VALKA shrugs.Why 'better' if it's Zoran? VALKA squeezes the flesh of his upper arms.We'll get food when we get to Lake Baikal, plenty of fish there.I'll be back in a week - if I find the lake. If not, you're on your own.I'll travel faster alone. Mr. Smith will be the Pakhan while I'm gone. JANUSZ turns and with a nod of the head 'follow me', to SMITH, he moves off.Don't let him out of your sight.Three days from here. South by West. He collapses. VOSS shouts for the fire to be built up, hot water to be boiled. He feels his pulse, checks his eyes.What did I say?I expect nothing less.We could've used you in the Polish army. Fired you out of a cannon. He closes his eyes, lapses back into a deep sleep.Followed? Where?Valka, go back on the other side of the track, then come up behind, in case he makes a run for it. VALKA moves off, gliding through the trees on the left of the track. The others wait a beat, then move into the trees on the right side of the track picking up fallen timber as weapons. JANUSZ is in the lead when in a clearing not fifty paces ahead, a figure steps out from behind a tree. JANUSZ stops, holding up a hand for the others to stay where they are. He stares at the small figure - a young woman. There's a glimpse of a dirty skirt under her coat, a scarf tied loosely about her neck. Wisps of chestnut hair stray out from under a moth-eaten fur hood. She looks frightened and desperate.She's Polish. Been following us for several days.Food? Protection? She's been too afraid to approach us until she was sure we weren't Russians.She's on the run, like us. Escaped from a Russian collective farm.She's starving.Zoran?I'm sorry. He reaches into his bag, passes her a fish and some nuts and berries. It's all she can do to refrain from eating it right away.What will you do?If we had enough food She stares at him, nods, then walks back toward the path, returning in the direction from which she came.She's educated. Speaks good English. And French.You don't like her, do you?I did speak to him. And the others. They agree she comes with us.You disagree.We'll have to go 'round it.They'll have dogs. Raise the alarm. We wouldn't stand a chanceI know we need food, but we're not going into that town, risk everything. SMITH gets up.Where's Valka?Damn him! He looks back down to the town.And risk arrest?The story you told usAnd you ran away. She nods. VALKA grinning proudly at her.No.I know.Mr. Smith? An American? Working on the Moscow metro?Why did he come to Russia for God's sake?What happened to his son?The Mongolian border is on the other side of those tracks. Two ARMED SOLDIERS can be seen walking along the tracks.This is the main line. It's going to be like this everywhere.We cross at night. Their attention is caught by the passing of a long freight train, horn sounding over the bucolic scene.Andrejs, for God's sake! VOSS slowly crosses the tracks, and disappears into the brush.They'll catch you if you stay, you know that.No, America?Good luck, Valka.Five, six hundred kilometers. ZORAN groans.But isn't Tibet closed to foreigners? I remember reading that.No! Andrejs, no! VOSS tries to free his arm.Don't kill it!You want the locals after us too? They break into Polish, a blazing argument, months of pent up frustration. VOSS picks up the sheep and carries it inside the ruin.You feel it?We're being watched. IRENA uneasy, squints in the direction of the hills. And you can feel it. Like a John Ford western there's a sense of being in Indian territory, of their every move watched by unseen eyes.What lake? It's a mirage. He plods on, away from the shimmering vision. There's little the others can do but trust JANUSZ, and slowly they follow.Yes, but haven't you noticed? He points upward to the low clouds obscuring the stars.What about it?We may pick up a little morning dew. Glad of something practical to do they all set about digging and lining holes with anything to hand.It's another mirage. SMITH shakes his head 'no'.It's East. We must head South. The others have joined them, staring toward the distant shape.No. We must keep going South! You'll kill us all!It's a mirage. Just a mirage. SMITH keeps walking away - a strange echo of the incident in Siberia when he walked away from the guards. Perhaps it is this memory that causes the others to turn silently, and collecting their few possessions, to follow him. JANUSZ watches a while, then slowly follows.Don't eat it all! He manages to save at least half of the meat, wrapping it in a cloth, and putting it in VOSS's backpack.But no food.When? Next week? Next month?Without food, we'll only get weaker. Maybe too weak to travel.I know that, but they mustn't.You can survive a month or more without food, but water?Maybe two days, maybe less in this heat.It's the only thing keeping us alive. But for how long?Do they hurt you?Can you go on?Do you see it?But do you see it?Eagles live in mountains. SMITH looks at the featureless landscape ahead.Knife . VOSS passes him the deer-bone knife. With it, he splits the end of his staff, to make a fork out of the end.You can still eat it. Just cut off its head. He passes the knife to VOSS, then creeps toward the creature, and striking quickly he attempts to trap the snake in the fork. Too slow. The snake disappears into its hole.It's not bad.You know Valka talked of eating each other? In Siberia?Probably.Scurvy.Mister?I mightn't know youur first name, but I know your son's name. SMITH stares at him.Can I say his name? Nothing from SMITH.'David'.Are you giving up?So why didn't you kill yourself?Punishment for what?And no-one can forgive you? And you can't forgive yourself?For us, the old life is gone. They sit in silence for a while.Yes.She'll torture herself for what she did. Just like you. That's why I have to get back!Why can't we go now?He said it was 'difficult'. SMITH comes in, and they make room for him in the cramped space.I'll just keep on going. Until it's over. Keep on walking. SMITH looks through the gloom to where JANUSZ sits - moonlight slashes the side of his face, but he can't quite see his eyes. CLOSE on JANUSZ. He's wide awake.
