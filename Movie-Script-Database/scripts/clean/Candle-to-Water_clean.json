Never used one.Wait \u00ad I gotta sign you out man. Paperwork. You got the forms?Sir? You're a knight? The queen dub you or something? If I don't call you sir that doesn't mean I don't respect. It just means I don't call you sir.Wait \u00ad you're that director.Seriously \u00ad I know you. I'm an actor. We met once. Maybe . . .No seriously. We met at an audition. You auditioned me.You must remember. I'm not doing this forever. Got plans to do things. Get my CV together. You must remember.Take it easy. I'm only asking.Come on man \u00ad just a j-peg to let my buddies know I saw you. I photograph everything. Got gigs of shit at home. But you \u00ad you're the man who directed. . .Exit? It's cool. Listen we won't do the . . . But slow down: you must remember me. You're \u00ad that's it: name begins with C. . .Clear. So what's on the video?It's fine, bro; but hostility ain't working. Not in here.It was that show - that play you were directing. Silver something. Shit. Four, five years back. Come on, man \u00ad you must remember.Sure, but look: what's with all the storage. You moving house or something?Shit no: Doll's just admin. Works up in the box.Dolls in the doll house, doing doll things. Bless.Whoa. Relax Mister C. Out is way. OK?Look I don't want you to mind me talking to you and all. I'm just being friendly: one pro to another. Come on man. Don't go believing this is my shit, because it ain't. Acting's my shit just like directing's yours. I was born to it \u00ad know what I mean? I knew you'd remember. Cy \u00ad that's it! Cy. Mo.Well that's better. No need for hostility between pros.Pros or ho's \u00ad know what I'm saying.What's on the video? None of my biz, I know; but I'm curious.Yup. Got the old bit. Wow. Ain't you got one online? Mine's online.Look sorry about that dude, but you need to let me know. That's my simple question: what happened.The audition. I didn't get the job.Seriously. The Silver thing.I know how good you are.I know your true potential. I know your talent doesn't belong packed up in here. Your greatness. And you've failed.You don't think I know how youYou're sorry for yourself. That's in your face.Cy \u00ad we're done here, seriously. Then I'll sign you out. You can ask about the mobile phone you dropped; but I doubt you can claim it on us. Just tell me why you're all stored up in here. Then . . .Brave Mister Caudwell. Genius. Solid citizen I don't think. Just need to know what you're doing. Then that's the end of it all.Couldn't pay your rent. Why don't you just say that. I couldn't pay my rent, Mo. That's fine. It's called la crunch du credit. And here we are.We're almost, nearly, seriously out of here, Mister Caudwell.On timers \u00ad saves power. You must know. Auto-ma-tic.Time to go home, Cy. My only ask is this. And you don't have to say yes, say anything. All I ask is we do it again.I know. I know it sounds strange. Bit silly even. But if you just let me run the thing again, this time I'll nail it \u00ad swear.I mean. On a fucking VHS video cassette. Where's Noah when you need him?Let's run this again from the top, Cy.Cy, seriously, man who directed nothing: let's just get this right. Then we can get on with things. You can go back your self-loathing and I can continue my rounds.Jesus not in here, bro. Christ a nipple sucked by mugs. One born every minute, tick tock.OK. So what's the brief?What's the scenario? Set the scene for me. Point me in the right direction. Even Brando needed goalposts.No sweat, Doll. Just relax. This place is damn big. And you're talking to the big expert here. Gotta do a circuit every hour. We gonna just do this thing, then it's home free. OK? Relax.That's it old fella. Get sorted out. In and out. Let it all be cool.Well not really Mister De Mille. It's just me and Doll today. Cutbacks. Don't ya love them?Set me straight, mister director!The director's chair.You know what I want. Just like you: another chance. Audition me again, you fucking VHS crumb. Give me my brief. Motivation, reality \u00ad the whole bit. Go.Again. The scenario, please Cy. Who am I? What do I want?Good dog. Now. . .That wasn't the character I read for, the last one I mean. My agent told me a soccer player who is afraid to tell his team- mates of his homosexuality. He turns to his manager for help, for answers to his dilemma; but in the face of this, of this outrage, the manager who has been like a surrogate father to him for years now turns against him, disgusted that the boy he believed in turned out to be a lamentable sausage jockey. Am I right?I'm right, man. That was the scenario wasn't it. The Silver thing I auditioned for that you turned me down for. Wrong. Ignored me for. Like the loser I was. Wrong. The winner is here. In front of you. So. . .Make like a camera.Noises.Without a script this time, note. Ad-libbing, free wheeling improvisazione, herr director!All my life. Imagine living a lie \u00ad forever. Not just the lies everybody lives day to day to get by, play the game; but one big lie that stretches from beginning to end: a truth so hideous that it could be called ordinary. A verity of the genes, of psychology. And then imagine the one person the liar could turn to turning away, so that the liar was left with nothing but the lie. Imagine exploding with the desire to be what you are, to be real, and to be accepted for what you are, perhaps even loved. Not loved with money for playing games, but loved with respect for having the strength to stand apart. Imagine that. But the works of the imagination must cede to that we call reality.Cy. Director.
