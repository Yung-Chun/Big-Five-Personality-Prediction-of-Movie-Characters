{"Sicario": {"ALEJANDRO": {"raw_line": "I think about the price. The price of appetite. The cost of forgetting who we are. Pretending we are... who we will never be...So easy to pretend we are not to blame. That a demon enters us. No... The demon is inside. We just make potions that release it.There's no revenge for all they have taken. No justice. It simply is...And still. They must be forced to look at all they have destroyed. By having the same done to them. Or they will forget... Forget they are human. Believe they are as different as they feel... Then they are the lion, and everything we loved and lost, simply its meal.And you too...Say it.Sit down.Can't walk back like this. We need to dry.Nothing.No.Nothing. I just wanted to know.Don't give me a reason.By telling me the truth without having to drown you.If you are very lucky you never will.It is the Colonel.Why so many?Where are we going?What did they do?Thank you.Hello.Have you been to Juarez before?What is your experience with operations like these?Sleep if you can. Juarez will demand all of your focus.Yes.I'm fine.Hmm?Yes.You are asking how a watch works. For now, only focus on knowing the time.Pay attention.Memorize the faces of everyone here. Know who is with you.I worked in Juarez.No.Mexico. As a federal prosecutor.No.I go where I'm sent.Cartagena.Want to see Juarez?Hard to believe, yes?He wears the state police shirt. The pig -- Not what you think it means. All state police work for the cartels. ALL of them. That man... He tried to work for two... he got greedy.Nothing will happen here. If they try anything, it will be at the border. If no lane is cleared for us when we return... Be ready. Watch the cars. Look for old cars. Throw aways. Not gangster cars... Those are for the whores on Saturday night. Did you watch the cars we passed driving in?Watch for state police. They are all bad. We will lose the escort at the loop. You will see. That is when you worry.Lean back, Kate.On the left.You have a service weapon?Get it out.Silver LeSabre. Two lanes over myGun. Buick LeSabre, 3 o'clock, gun.watch the door handles.All the women can go.Watch these men close. Look for the ones like the men you saw in Juarez.Do you see?Yes. Keep looking.They see it all, and must avoid the traps set everywhere for them. We look for one who is older... one who has had enough.Break them into groups of four, Let them spread out, each group as far from the other as possible.Fausto Alarcon, Manuel's cousin... Manuel's boss... He is an executioner...When people die in my country, it is with his hand or his blessing. To find him would be like... discovering a vaccine. Manuel will lead us to him.Certainly, you understand the value of that.There is only dark, my friend.We should watch here.You know this land? A tunnel where cars can pass?Can you mark the tunnel on here?This is our way across. Right here. Where do you live?Know a Wells Fargo on Baseline?Guillermo told the truth about everything.Thank you ... don't cross again. Not for a long time.Better than good, my friend.We are close.Don't go in the bank, Kate.We need him to get called back to Mexico. That's the objective, Kate.How many officers do they have on the force?You want the truth?Give the names, give the houses, phone numbers ... Give me all of you.He wasn't an assassin. He was just supposed to be your friend and hopefully find out who is showing you how to hurt them. They are looking for us, not you.I've been doing this for a long time.In Mexico, police do not investigate crimes for the government. Attorneys do. That's what I did. I was very close to arresting someone who ... someone I shouldn't have tried to arrest.The brilliance of what they do when they mutilate a body is make people think -- Oh, that person must have done something to receive such a death. They must have been involved.They must have deserved it ... And for the family ... It soils every memory you have of that person. They make it impossible to imagine the face you loved without seeing the initials carved into her forehead. Imagine her body without seeing her chest with -- remember her before...Her breasts were cut off ... Remember your child without ...They kill the body, the memory, everything.You remind me of my wife. I find it very difficult to look at you.Get some rest tonight. Tomorrow they will call Manuel back, and we will cut a leg from them.I don't use those. Ask Matt.Take the left shaft ... Make noise.No. Draw them to you. The one I am looking for will try and run.What you do now is for your family. Whether they see tomorrow rests with you.You will drive me.Put that down.We are in Mexico now. You have no jurisdiction.Don't ever point a weapon at me again. Get your breath and go back to the surface.Stop it Kate. Just stop. This is what we were sent here to do.I don't have time. Go to the surface. Now.I am here to kill the man with the power to summon Manuel Diaz. I am here for Fausto. But I will kill Manuel too. It's what I do, Kate. Go. Or I will do it to you.Get in.Drive back to Mexico.I am through, do you have my location?Este a calle cinquinta y seis.Having family... does that save the lives of the men you are hired to kill? Hmm?This is the target ahead? Confirm.Put on your lights. Pull the car over.Use the speaker. Tell him to get out of the car.Tell him to raise his shirt and turn around.Tell him to do it or you will shoot him where he stands.Look how good you are at pretending to be a police officer. Out of the car. Now.Walk back to your car.A mule. Like you.In the leg so you don't run. In the hand so you don't try to fight and make me have to kill you yet.I know who you are, Manuel. You are no jefe, but you will drive me to one...If you try anything, if you betray me, your daughters will burp the semen of twenty men with their last breath. Do you understand me?Get in.Drive.You get out and walk toward them.What you do now is for your family. There is no you.No. Not anymore. Now I am the same. Turn the car a bit more to the left.SIENTATE! AQUI!!Your children speak English?Then we will spare them. I interrupted dinner. Please... Continue.Every night, you have families killed, and yet you dine. Tonight should be no different.Eat.Take the children away from here.You. Whore. Sit over there.You're not finished. Eat...I will give you a choice, Fausto, one I was not given... You may choose to die tonight or live with the shame of having the mother of your children take your place...Yes ... Choose.See why you married her. Spunk.Watch death come for you. Watch. The devil is near, Fausto. He is waiting for you.This is what they think of you. You see?Maybe you have enough pride that you don't marry another one of these. Maybe you take his money and go hide and raise your children far from here. Maybe your son grows up to be a doctor. And I don't have to come back and kill him some day.I think maybe, it will be the thing that kills us all ... as a people, you know?Stop it.That will scar. I'm sorry.Let me look ... Move your hand.These ribs are bruised, but not broken, yes?I would recommend not standing on balconies for a little while.In Mexico, the killers are called Sicarios... The word comes from the zealots of Jerusalem. Killers who hunted the Romans that invaded their homeland... They don't deserve the term.Policing them does nothing. They must be killed. Wherever they are found. They will make every place they touch Juarez. Now ... Now you understand how far we have fallen.You look like a girl when you're scared. Such beauty in you when you let yourself be frail. Like the daughter they took from me ... This is not the work for you. Look at yourself, Kate. What it has done to you in just three days ... Find a little town far from the border. A place where the rule of law still exists. You will spot predators there very easy now... Make a difference you can see everyday. Because you will not survive here. You are not a wolf. This is the land of wolves now.We like to think if we cut the head from the snake, the serpent will die...But there is no snake. They are worms. When you cut the head, a new one grows. From both segments ... We cannot question if the end justifies the means because there is no end to consider...This is the price of our self indulgence. Our weakness ... Our appetite. They are our demons, our creation.There is a moment in each person's life. A choice. Do what feels good... Do what is good. Make the wrong choice enough, and it is not presented again... then all choices are bad. And the consequences worse. There is no war on drugs. Only war. The enemy we fight?

They're everywhere and I'll never know who to trust, as evidenced by me fucking my hit man behind a bar.That doesn't scare you?What's the plan?We have tac gear in our car.Jesus.Because CIA can't operate within US borders without a domestic agency attached.

You've been kicking doors longer.Makes you feel better to have him around, he can tag along after we get back from El Paso.The men who are REALLY responsible.We'll get to that...Don't want anything to happen to you on the way to the airport.To keep my promise.Doesn't matter. It leads to Fausto. And I'm going to turn you loose.Kate.This way.No. We just landed.This is my bird dog, his name's Alejandro.Yeah, we'll talk about it on the plane.Yeah.You guys don't have one?They got some bitchin peanuts in the back. Kind of a self-serve deal though.Good. Trying to get DOD to let me look into this conspiracy to sink Figi.I figure a month or two there, I could get it worked out.Yeah, I'll keep you posted... who's going over today?I get all warm and fuzzy when you say `team'.Where's everybody linking up?Thought you were in the big time in Phoenix... welcome to Baghdad.Man, I love Texans.Sure, we'll take the tour.

Stay here.But you don't want to, do you?You asked to get on this train. Because you KNOW you're not stopping anything in Phoenix. You're just sweeping up the mess. In six months, every house you raid will be rigged with explosives... You want to find the men responsible? This is where we start.Yeah. That got a little nutty, huh?Hey. I told you to stay here...Don't sell yourself short. Reason Reggie's home is I know he's not ready for this, but he's gonna have to get ready real quick, because this is the future. Juarez is what happens when they dig in...On that note, I think you better stay out here.Giving him a belly full of water... you devil.Didn't think we'd get you here, did you?I love it when they don't hablo. Brought an old buddy of yours. Bet you `hablo' to him.Alejandro, he remembers you.Can they get them all in one place? No... I'm on a clock now, I can't wait... No, contact Bob Fiske. Have him hold all of them at the staging center. How far is Tuscon?We'll be there a little after 2.You gotta learn how to sleep on a plane.Has nothing to do with your race. I just don't believe you're good enough at your job yet to be of any use. Kate's sure fond of you, though.We'll be quick.You're so dramatic, Bob. This is Kate Macy with the FBI, and her partner `what's his name'... It was her call.First I've heard it.Two ways to find drug routes. You can play cat and mouse with those clowns, or ask these guys what trails they avoid.All yours.This feels very serious.Then go. I didn't ask you to be a part of this. She did.What would you like to know?Guillermo told us about a tunnel east of Nogales, near Sasabe. So now, we're trying to find what areas near there migrants avoid. Because that's where the tunnel will be. Better?I'm going back in.Guillermo didn't have any other options. We send him back across the border and he's a dead man. Had to give us something.We're going to make enough noise that Manuel Diaz is called back to Mexico to see HIS boss.And then we know where his boss is.It's been a humdinger of a day. Go home. Get some rest. We'll find a ride. See you tomorrow.Come on in.Guillermo was telling the truth.How good is your Spanish?Power of persuasion.We're gonna have a good day. Let's send these guys home.Think they'd tell us all this and then go back to Mexico? You get one night's sleep and forget everything?Have friends at Phoenix SWAT?They any good?Got a new frame of reference for practice now, don't you. Let's give Phoenix SWAT a call, shall we?When he comes out of the bank. We need the deposit receipt to seize the account. Let him do the assault... we hit him when he comes out.Endorsing over her paycheck.When he walks out of the bank, we pull beside and you take him.Now.KATE --We knew where his accounts were, we just didn't know they were shaking people down in front of the fucking branch. It's a bogus bust, though. Can't prosecute it. No one controls who deposits money in an account. An attorney will have that money back in a few months... but a lot of heads will roll before then...Don't you dare.You can't arrest him.You said that Ted.The beauty of you being so beat to shit... No one's gonna notice a couple more scratches... this is a new game, Ted.I'm the guy who will decide if your daughters get Federal protection or whether we post your ex wife's address on the internet. I decide whether you go to prison at a work camp in Missouri or a kill house like Corcoran. This is where you negotiate how to survive...Good job.You write it that way in the report. Yes?Real quick thinking, Kate.Sure ... This is good news. They're going to call Manuel back. Soon.Gotta have a little faith.We may have the tunnel, right here.We'll know soon enough.Tasty beverage?Going hunting.We'll save that for later.First thing, get that surveillance van operational.Do it.You aren't really dressed for it.You went crying to daddy yesterday. We don't want daddy to know everything. Loose lips sink ships, haven't you learned that yet? Don't worry, we got extra--Relax. You guys will hang back when we get there, k?Hey. All the drugs we find, you guys get to confiscate. Gonna be a big day.What. What. What's he saying?Where.We're gonna have to hit the tunnel the minute we get on the ground.Pretty exciting, huh?On foot from here.Weapons free, my friend.Where is the target?We need to boogie. And we need to do it quiet till we find the center.Good luck.They don't get freer buddy.Cross this and it's new rules.Is he through?This was a clean, clean fucking op my friend.She's not with you?Okay, let's go. We're missing one.Our government doesn't have assassins. We farm that out.Refers to a time when one group controlled every aspect of the drug trade. Providing a measure of order.
