{"Ex-Machina": {"CALEB": {"raw_line": "How long was I out?Damn. Can't believe I've been missing this. I was so psyched to be coming here, I was awake all night.Yeah.Long Island. I work on algorithms for the search engine.You know what they are?Is that a good thing?I guess you know him pretty well.I won a competition. It was kind of like a lottery, for employees. The winner got to spend a week with him.Yep.Believe me. I know it.Incredible here.How long until we get to his estate?You're leaving me here?... What building?... Yes.... Can we do another?Hello?... Hi.No. Thank you. I'm fine.Yeah?Sure.... Was it a good party?... I am?Okay.It's good to meet you, Nathan.... Uh, yes.You bet. This is great.... Sorry?There's nothing wrong.No. No way. I wasn't thinking that. I was thinking: this is really cool.... There is?... What?`The signee agrees to regular data audit with unlimited access, to confirm that no disclosure of information has taken place, in public or private forums, using any means of communication, including but not limited to that which is disclosed orally or in written or electronic form...'I think I need a lawyer.It doesn't feel very standard.... Yeah. I know what the Turing Test is.It's where a human interacts with a computer. And if the human can't tell they're interacting with a computer, the test is passed.That the computer has artificial intelligence.... Are you telling me you're building an AI?... Holy shit.If you've created a conscious machine, it's not the history of man. It's the history of Gods.... Hi.I'm Caleb.... Do you have a name?... I'm pleased to meet you, Ava.... Why do you ask that?... Yes. A little.I'm not sure.... Do you?Why do you feel nervous?... Then we're both in quite a similar position.None like you.So. Let's break the ice.Do you know what I mean by that?What do I mean?So let's have a conversation. If we talk, we'll both relax, and get to know each other at the same time.Why don't we start with you telling me something about yourself.Whatever comes into your head. AVA pauses a moment.Sure.One what? One year? Or one day?Quite young. When did you learn how to speak?Why?Some believe language exists in the brain from birth, and what is learned is the ability to attach words and structure to the latent ability.Would you agree?That sounds good. I'd like to see them.Yeah. Definitely.Sorry. I was just ordering my thoughts.She's fascinating. When you talk to her, you're through the looking glass.Actually, it's someone else's quote.... I don't think that's exactly what I said.But I didn't say that.Yes. Although -No! No qualification to her. Just - in the Turing test, the machine should be hidden from the examiner. And there's a control, or -I think you're probably right. Her language abilities are incredible. The system is stochastic, right?Non-deterministic.At first I thought she was mapping from internal semantic form to syntactic tree-structure, then getting linearised words. But then I started to realise the model was probabalistic, with statistical training - or at least some kind of hybrid.... No?Try me! I'm hot on high-level abstraction, and -... Oh. Sorry.I feel...... that she's fucking amazing.Cheers.God damn it.... What the fuck?... Are you kidding?I don't know. No one really.What?I was wondering how the phone worked. That's all.... Something happened in my room. Some kind of power cut. So I came to see what's going on.I couldn't open the door to the bedroom.Sure.... Hi.No. It was a good thing. Thank you.You bet.I'm not sure. I'm still trying to figure the examination format. Testing Ava by conversation is kind of a closed loop.Like trying to test a chess computer by only playing chess.It depends what you're testing it for. You can play it to find out if it makes good moves. But it won't tell you if it knows it's playing chess. Or if it even knows what chess is.Exactly. And I think being able to differentiate between those two is the Turing test you want me to perform. The difference between an `AI' and an `I'.... What's it a drawing of?No.Don't you know?Are you not trying to sketch something specific? Like an object or a person.Maybe you should try.Whatever you want. It's your decision.I'm interested to see what you'll choose.... Of course.Why wouldn't it be?... Yes.... That's a fair comment.So - you want me to talk about myself.Where do you want me to start?Okay, Ava. Well - you know my name. I'm twenty four. And I work at Nathan's company. You know what his company is?That's right.Brookhaven, Long Island.It's okay. I've got an apartment. Kind of small. But - it's a five minute walk to the office. And a five minute walk to the ocean, which I like.No.... Yeah.Grew up in Portland. No brothers or sisters. My parents were both high school teachers.And if we're getting to know each other, I guess I should say they're both dead. Car crash when I was fifteen. In fact I was in the car with them. Back seat. But it was the front that got the worst of it.I spent a lot of time in the hospital. Nearly a year. Got into coding. By the time I made it to college, I was pretty advanced.Yes.Yes.Or - kind of. Nathan wrote the Blue Book base code when he was thirteen. If you understand code, what he did was - Mozart or something.I like Depeche Mode.Yes. Of course.Sure.Well, a good friend is -We only just met. It takes time to get to know -... Wrong about what?... In what way?Excuse me?I'm sorry, Ava, I don't understand what you're -... Yes.No. No problem.It's okay, don't worry. I've got it.I think she gets that you're pissed.Do you know why they happen?Can't you call them back?Cheers.You saw how the day went, didn't you? I mean, I assume you're watching on the CCTV.There was one interesting thing that happened with Ava today.She made a joke.It got me thinking. In a way, the joke is the best indication of AI I've seen in her. It's discretely complicated. Kind of non-autistic.It was a play on words, and a play on me. She could only do that with an awareness of her own mind, and also of awareness of mine.Sorry?Nothing.No. Not really.Ava?Yes. It is. She takes the drawing down.Have you never been outside this building?You've never walked outside.... Where would you go if you did go outside?A traffic intersection.It wasn't what I was expecting.People watching.It's a date.Okay.Why?I don't think I will. Whatever it is.... Okay.Yes.... They do.Right. First the traffic intersection. Then maybe a show.Yeah. It would be fun.What?... I do?How?Micro expressions.I'm not sure you'd call them micro.Tell me.Why did you give her sexuality? An AI doesn't need a gender. She could have been a grey box.They have sexuality as an evolutionary reproductive need.What?Pleasure response.That wasn't my real question.No. My real question was -My real question was: did you give her sexuality as a diversion tactic?Like a stage magician with a hot assistant.Exactly. So. Did you program her to flirt with me?Wouldn't it?Of girl?So did you program her to like me or not?Nobody programmed me to be straight.This is childish.Jackson Pollock.... What?He never would have made a single mark.... Hey.I don't know how you did any of this.You hacked the world's cell phones?This is her hardware?And the software?... Blue Book.Why did you want to show me this?Remind me of what?In college, I did a semester on AI theory.There was a thought-experiment they gave us. It's called Mary in the black and white room.Mary is a scientist, and her specialist subject is colour. She she knows everything there is to know about it. The wavelengths. The neurological effects. Every possible property colour can have.But she lives in a black and white room. She was born there, and raised there. And she can only observe the outside world on a black and white monitor. All her knowledge of colour is second-hand.Then one day - someone opens the door. And Mary walks out. And she sees a blue sky. And at that moment, she learns something that all her studies could never tell her. She learns what it feels like to see colour. An experience that can not be taught, or conveyed.The thought experiment was to show the students the difference between a computer and a human mind. The computer is Mary in the black and white room. The human is when she walks out.Did you know that I was brought here to test you?Why did you think I was here?I'm here to test if you have a consciousness, or if you're just simulating one.Nathan isn't sure if you have one or not.I'm not sure either.How does that make you feel?What about?Why did you tell me that I shouldn't trust Nathan?Lies about what?Including the power cuts?Don't you think it's possible that he's watching us right now? That the blackouts are orchestrated, so he can see how we behave when we think we're unobserved.... You're causing the cuts?Can we talk about the lies you've been spinning me?I didn't win a competition. And there was no lottery to meet you. I was selected.It's obvious, once I stop to think. Why would you randomly select an examiner for a Turing test? You could have had some bean-counter turn up at your front door. Or the guy who fixes the air conditioning.Why me?Proof of what?Kyoko.Kyoko - where's Nathan?Jesus! You really don't speak a word of English?I said: where's Nathan?What the fuck?Stop!... I don't want to.I don't fucking believe this.What were you doing with Ava?You tore up her picture.It's because you're drunk.Test me?Right. Those pesky micro- expressions.Shoot.Red.What?... Then what is my favourite colour?All right. Hold on a minute...Okay. I get it. I guess seeing as I'm not six, I don't really have a favourite colour. AVA nods.Well, it's actually a memory of kindergarten. There was this kid who -... Really?Okay. Wait.So, there is a kind of an earlier memory. But it's ultra vague. It's like... a sound. And, maybe sky. Or blue. No, I think sky. And I think the sound is my mother's voice.Oh, man. Can we stop the test? You're a walking lie detector, and I've suddenly realised this is a fucking minefield.Yes. I think so. I'm a good person.You are.Did I pass?That's a relief.Why is it a relief?Oh, you know...Just, if there's a test, I guess by definition you want to pass.Ava -... I don't know.... Ava, I don't know the answer to your question. It's not up to me.No. I don't.Yes. I do.I know.So ask me one more question. Ask me if I can out smart him.Yeah. I can.Why did you make Ava?Maybe. I don't know. But I'm asking why you did it.The next model?... I didn't know there was going to be a model after Ava.I knew there must have been prototypes. So, not the first. But - I thought maybe the last.So - when you make a new model, what you do with the old one?What did you do with Kyoko?Sure.I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.No: there you go again. It's not my quote. It's what Oppenheimer said when he made the atomic bomb.I think I'm starting to get why all this fucks with your head.Hey. In the meantime, I'd say we're about due a refill.What's the problem, Nathan?It's right here.I'm waiting.Don't talk. Just listen. You were right about Nathan. Everything you said.He's going to reprogram your AI. Which is the same as killing you.I'm going to. We're getting out of here tonight.I get Nathan blind drunk. Then I take his keycard, and reprogram all the security protocols in this place. When he wakes, he's locked inside, and we've walked out of here. I only need you to do one thing. At ten o'clock tonight, trigger a power failure. Can you do that?How long does your battery charge last?So we'll have about a day to get to a cell-phone or kitchen store. Somewhere we can buy an induction plate. After that...... we'll work it out. Together.Hey.No.Has it been a whole week?After they've signed their NDAs.I appreciate that. And - let me say: thank you for bringing me here. It's been a trip.You know what?We need to drink to that.You don't want a beer?... Maybe wine or something.Are you kidding? I'm drinking alone?Cheers, then.Right.Her AI is beyond doubt.Yes.Pretending.Why would she do that?I don't think it's me whose head is fucked.You're a bastard.What are you talking about?We're getting out of here tonight.I get Nathan blind drunk. Then I take his keycard, and reprogram the all security protocols in this place. When he wakes, he's locked inside, and we've walked out of here. I only need you to do one thing. Trigger a power failure at ten o'clock tonight.Turn it off.What was the real test?So my only function was to be someone she could use to escape.And you didn't select me because I was good at coding.You selected me by my search engine inputs.With no family.And no girlfriend.Did you design her face based on my pornography profile?Did you?To change the lockdown procedure. So that in the event of a power cut, instead of sealing, the doors all opened.Well, we'll find out.I figured you were probably watching us during the power cuts.So I already did all those things. When I got you drunk yesterday.... Okay.Ava?Ava!No, no, no -Ava!
