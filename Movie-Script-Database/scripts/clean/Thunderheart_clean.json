Hey, you, listen up --Bullshit.You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.You've got no jurisdiction.Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.-- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.His spiritual mother...Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.Crow Horse.Fuck you.Mrs... Blue Legs?

As in medicine man?Why does he wanna see me?What did he say?He knows me?What's he smoke in that?Tell him I'm trying to find the man who murdered Leo Fast Elk. Ask him if he knows where he is.What did he say?He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say?What was he saying?Because he was talking to me.Does he know something?And...So what?The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.Mr. Clear Moon.They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.X22. Read.I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.FBI, freeze, Motherfucker -- drop it, drop it!Turn around, put your hands on the roof of the truck.That's right. Turn around.This Jimmy's?Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?Who did?A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world.When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay?Move it, Magdelana.It was just Eagle Bear. I questioned and released her.She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. \"What's the FBI really doing here.\" Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.I gave it back to her.If it is Jimmy's, she's taking it to him. We'll have a runner. But I borrowed a little mojo...Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?Cooch. Where the fuck did they send us?For all I know, you're Jimmy. And you're just waiting for a shot at my jugular. Drink, Jimmy. Milk is good for you --I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.Have a nice day.She's your sister?Gotchya. We just nailed a genetic match between the eagle feather left at the murder site and one in Jimmy's medicine bundle. It came from a white eagle. Same bird.-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold. Electromagnetic printing.I don't see the connection.That's not solid.You're saying a white guy did it...Alright, Crow Horse. I'm listening. I'm listening to the trees, to the stones. Who is it?The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.I can't do that, It's a Rolex.I'm sorry, this is -- -- this is very, very expensive. It's -- Tell him this is an expensive watch.Don't tell me: heavy duty.Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.It's not real.I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.He speaks English.Take care of yourself, Walter.Well we better use those twelve hours to apprehend the right man.Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.There was also a print found in the Badlands that indicated diagetic locomotion. Heels first. Jimmy's walking pattern doesn't match. He has a distinct Indian walk.They don't smoke hooch in The Pipe, Miles. They smoke something called kinickinick, it's like a tobacco.When did we get that?-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.Alright. Alright...Thanks, Cooch.Motherfucker.All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.It may have been Maggie's way of saying \"get off my ass.\"Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.-- Cooch. Woh. Stop.Yes.Because this isn't a dry wash.It's the Little Walking River.And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.Listen to the water...Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.Cuz you're a cop.What are you talking about?And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.They found prints at Blue Legs' place.Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.I'm sick of your shit --Woh, hold on there, Jack, you're --No plates. No registration. Serial numbers removed. And all prints washed off by the river. That's great. This is turning out to be a walk in the park, do you know that?Never mind.I read, Cooch.Good.No, Maggie. But you're gonna have to join me for a ride. I'm taking you to Rapid City.You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...I desecrated it?If I told you... that I think Jimmy's innocent... but I'm in over my head... would you believe me?What?Great.You ever see that car before?Who's it belong to?Help me, Maggie...I didn't see you today, Maggie. Goodbye.Anyone who fought or spoke out against it... wound up dead or in jail.That was 1868, Maggie...Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --Hey, put that down.Sherman!Look... I'm not who you think I am. I'm sorry.Why?Cooch. They sent us out here because the place was being neglected. Now, all of a sudden, there's two five man SWAT teams out there tonight. Bell Huey choppers flying all over the place. Federal occupation to catch one guy. Why, Cooch? What's going on?I'm looking for Richard Yellow Bird.Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?At Sioux Falls Pen?Leavenworth a tough joint?No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?An arrangement was made between you... and us. Do you remember that arrangement?Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.Get up out of the chair, Richard.Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.Get up!They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.Leo Fast Elk... is alive.How the hell do you know?The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them.You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!I'm the fucking law!Keep talking, Yellow Bird...You and me both.Maggie!Crow Horse, listen --Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go.Do they come in dreams, these visions?Just before we caught Jimmy... I had a dream that I was being chased. And I was running with other people. Old- fashion Indian people. I got shot in the back. Like Leo.At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?Well, it was just a dream, I --What do you mean?Sorry.We've driven a long way. Where is this place?Yeah. Fitful dreams.What the hell do you want me to do?!What's that?Jesus. Oil?1868...That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.Listen to the water... the river keeps goin' down then rising again.No. No...This Clear Moon's house?What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.X21. Come back.Reservation.I'm on my way back in. Over.You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.No...I had to finish something with Crow Horse.Why didn't you tell me what we were doing here?We're running a cover-up and you didn't --You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?Crow Horse!Crow Horse!I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.Bullshit, let's get outta here,He's gone.We're going for The Stronghold.Yellow bird... is gonna sing.Fuck you.Walter.We're in there.

You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.Sioux Indian, right?It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.Seven.Don't worry about it, Ray. As long as the people have proof that we sent them one of their own, no one's gonna ask you to weave baskets or make it rain.Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently.The agents who have worked out here say its like going into Nam. Unfamiliar terrain, foreign language, foreign customs... and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds. They hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here.Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns. That's scary shit.Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? \"To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests\"?No. I consulted it. We're going into Indian Country, I wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass. Don't you?Who found him?Okay. I think Agent Levoi and I can proceed from here. What are your call signals?Good. Thanks, Guys.Looks like Fast Elk wasn't fast enough to outrun that load. What do you make of the damage?That's what it looks like, doesn't it? But that's what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away.Ray.Good morning.Taking ol' Leo somewhere?Check him out, Ray.Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?Who are you?I know where I am. I'm on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you don't wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions. It's your call. Who are you?You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.Who the fuck is he?He's a fucking cop.No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh... Ray... Little Weasel.What journey?We'll have to give Leo a refund. Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In case you don't know, Officer, violation of the Major Crimes Act on --Good.

Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.A murder.

I want you to fraternize. Socialize. Penetrate. Infiltrate. Eat some raw kidney, and get these Indians talking. I'm gonna Powwow with Big Chief Clear Moon and find out more about Leo.Maisy Blue Legs place?I got one up on ya.I've got the doer. I know who he is.Meet me at base. Over.Jimmy Looks Twice.One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.The progressive Indians don't like them because they want everybody to go back to the old Indian ways, and the old way Indians don't like them because they use violence to get attention.That's right.Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat.Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.It's show time.This is the FBI! Come on out of there nice and slow. Let's move it! Hands on your head!James Looks Twice?Let's take a walk, Jimmy. Come on.We just wanna take a look around your place, Jimmy.

Jesus...Get him...Assault on federal officers. Suspect has left the area. One officer down. Issue a Fugitive Alert immediately. Over.No, the officer's been bitten by a fucking badger, okay? Get a Fugitive Alert fucking now! Over.Who's this guy?Ray, get to Jimmy's place and keep it tight. I'm gonna get a tail on his Warriors.Ray, you alright?What'd she say?Let's see it.Way to go, Raymond. Miles, take that to lab. Sherman, I want you to go back to base and produce some written material. Something that indicates that our girl Maggie is leaking information to us. And make sure that material finds its way into the hands of the Warrior Movement.You gentlemen missed that medicine basket. Go back through the house, and make sure you missed nothing else. And lay some wire, too. Let's do it.That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.Her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within. The Warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support.Her oil pan is shot.Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. You're the Indian.Get a tail on her, Ray.A long way from home. You be careful out there.Bingo. It's working.The right man? Talk to me, Ray.You boys want a soda?No, Ray's buying. Sherman? Coke?Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house.Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.Ray.I'll sleep around a little.And get rid of the dog.Bastards...He's out there. He's out there playing Sitting Bull with us. I want the motherfucker so bad I'm getting a bleeding ulcer.She's that subtle?Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --Tread matches. It's the car.But this doesn't make any sense, Ray. If it's just been sitting in this dry wash for seven days... why the hell didn't we find it?The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.Jesus, you alright?Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!-- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got Jimmy nailed. Let's go!HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!Trailer's clean, let's go.Damn. That's one hard running Indian.It's over, Ray. I aged five years. But it's over.

Tomorrow, we fly.Couldn't sleep, Ray?That's where you were. You had to go back and have it out with the Indian law...You fucking hot head, we can get in trouble for that.You ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking Everglades, Mister.-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?Jesus Christ. What are you doing? What the hell were you doing out there?This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.No. We neutralized enemies of the United States. Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out here!Jesus, Ray. You think I don't like the Indians? Not true. These were noble people but their day is gone. They're a conquered nation. They want all of America back but they can't even keep the garbage out of their own front yards. It's sad, Ray. But it's just the way it is. We have to function as a colonial police force out here.Yeah, we're ready.RAY!No, damn it. You call teams in and this is gonna be a fucking media event. Get me three cars, six agents, block all reservation exits. It's under control.X21. Ray. Ray, please come in.-- he's not getting off the reservation.FREEZE!
