Now, what part don't you understand?I don't need anybody. I got three little angels looking over my shoulder.Ever hear of dry cleaning? Now, shut the fuck up, check for the rest of my dope.Wheels with his PISTOL, unloads the clip. BULLETS are catching up, ripping up the couch and the rest of the suite.

It's in our fucking timetable. So what else?You. Shut up. Now, listen, you little pussy. We're not making pizza.We're making money. I gave you a deadline. If you succeed, you're a millionaire. If you fail, you're a fuckin' corpse. And so help me God, Elliot. If you give me a fuckin' ulcer, I'll dig up your dead mother and fuck her with your severed dick, do you understand? Christ -- Noah?! Bring me something for my stomach! A fuckin' Snapple or somethin'.My three little angels told me I'd get a visit from the cops tonight and there they are. When they split up, we'll drop the tall one and get the other one to lead us to the girl.Forget the cop. Kill the girl!enters, with Casper and Ferguson to either side.Grab her. But the doors to the second elevator open.With balls the size of Pennsylvania. Two GUNS in hand, walks forward with barrels fixed and FIRING. Clips out on one, tosses the gun aside, then, with his free hand, reaches down and grabs Julie by the hair and lifts her until she stands.Let's go!Out of the car! The doors fly open and all three are out in the middle of the stalled traffic, Julie being drug along with them. The gang cuts down an alley.He sees his chance and GUNS the ENGINE. The cab barrels at Burnett, who's stuck in the middle of the boulevard, about to become instant roadkill. Then --I have something for you to listen to. Fouchet lifts his PISTOL and FIRES a single shot. BAM! INTERCUT WITH --That bullet just killed the chemist. Now, I have but four hours left to make my deal. Fuck with my timetable and the next bullet kills the girl. Julie is gagged and sitting on the floor, scared shitless.Yes?Yes, Francine... What is it?Is that all?I'm very pleased, Francine.

I'm Mike --We're lookin' for a couple of our Latin friends who checked in a little while ago. You might remember them?Oh, didn't they say? There's going to be party! It's B.Y.O.B.O. -- The B.O. stands for baby oil.Police! On the floor! But the dealers split, rolling out of their chairs. One goes left and the other, right. CUT TO:appears soon after, walking down the hotel steps, leading the Latina in his cuffs, and wearing his jacket.What? We TILT UP as POLICE HELICOPTER flies overhead.Oh man... He tears open the bottle of aspirin. Chug-a-lugs.Ah, family life. Reminds me why I stay single. JILL & QUINCY Uncle Mike! Uncle Mike!Hiya, kids. Mornin', Theresa. Lowrey pecks Theresa on the cheek. She recoils.I promise, Theresa. I only tell your husband about my sleazy sex life. The TELEPHONE RINGS.You're live with Lowrey. 'Scuse me, Captain. I think you mean to say, 'Get the fuck down here, please?' Burnett automatically pulls on his jacket, hugs the children as Lowrey hangs up.Don't get your sticky fingers all over my windows... and keep your feet off the seats, I just had the leather conditioned. The kids ignore him, gleefully continuing to squirm around. Before Burnett can get into the car, Theresa runs out.If I'm lyin' I'm dyin'. Her sister came down and posted the girl's bail. And later? Man, talk about special effects.Tell you later -- Mornin', Francine. Where's the smile?If it ain't the leftovers from Miami Vice. Fashion casualties, lost somewhere in the eighties.So I guess we should start with the C.I.s and the perps from the original case. But hell if I know any dope dealers with the balls to pull this off. They're either dead or in the lock-up pending trial.Hey, fuck you and your cheap, off- the-rack suit.Nothing like a little old-fashioned incentive.I think you should go ahead, crawl up and give it a good look.For one, it was your idea. Two, while my suit's fresh, you're dressed for the occasion.And I don't?Anything?Listen, Cedras. You and I both know you're the number one importer for the Simona Brothers. And I'm tellin' you there's a buttload of H on the move and someone's gonna wanna stick their dick in it. So it better not be yours. You hear something? You call us. You hear nada? You better get the fuck outta town.Okay. So we talk to Max.You got a better idea?Raincheck, darlin'. Gotta talk. Anyplace we can go?Sorry to come around only when I need something.Hey, I didn't open my mouth. Listen, there's some major, major ill shit happening down at the P.D. Lotta heroin involved. There's gonna be a lotta cash involved, too. Gonna be some happy motherfuckers around that wanna party.Just make a coupla calls. See what's what. Don't be doin' no wild shit. Just call me if you hear something.You know, that was really smooth. Think you could do that again? Ohh. I'll tell you, when the wife gets meaner, the grass gets greener.I don't think anybody could be that married.Miami's the perfect town for you, Burnett. You drive like a one- hundred-seven-year-old lady with her turn signal on.You gonna let every old motherfucker pass you? Or just the ones with big-ass trailers draggin' behind? A-c-c-el-er-ate.Who said that?If somebody's talking about me, I wanna know... Man, I'm so sick of this. I don't apologize for nothing I do. I get up early and take it to the max every day. I'm always the first guy through the door. And the last guy to leave a crime scene. So fuck 'em all. I could give a shit what those boot lickin', brown-nosin', ass kissin' motherfuckers think of Mike Lowrey. What can Burnett say to all that, but...Oh, fuck you, Marcus. The RADIO CRACKLES.Yeah. Roger that. Gimme the address.The air conditioning business has been good to Orona. Lowrey rings the bell. They wait. No answer.Wait. Hear that? I thought I heard Orona beating his wife.Uh oh. No alarm.No, man. Musta been you.Now what? A sickened Burnett goes over to the body, speaking to Orona as if he were alive.Jai-Alai. Dog track. Lotta bookies. Phone numbers.He trades the plans for his paper and gets popped by the perps.I think we got us a witness. Over here I got two different shades of lipstick on one champagne glass. Meanwhile --Whatcha got?What? Who is it? Lowrey instintively pushes past his partner and kneels at the body. He pulls back the sheet. Right now he could kill the shooter, then himself. In that order. Lowrey's eyes well up.I shoulda told you to be careful.Eddie Dominguez. I want his phone calls. He flashes a badge.I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't polite enough. With a flashing right jab, Lowrey pops the snooty Clerk. After the Clerk finds his feet, eyes peering over the counter...Three calls to Lois Fields. I'm going to stop by her place and tell her a bedtime story. You can catch a ride with Howard. Lowrey jumps in the car.This is twenty-one two. I'm gonna need back-up at 614 Reach Road. Lowrey eases inside the darkness of the doorway. He checks the lights, but the power is off. Slipping the radio into his coat pocket, he returns with a mini- flashlight and begins to clear a path, doorway by doorway, then moving up a wide stairwell.Yeah. Thanks for the get-well card.Hey. I'm not the one who left a strange hooker alone in my apartment. You know, she's probably on the street sellin' all my shit as we speak.Dogs, too? I got Persian rugs, man. I'm going home... explain the whole thing, take her to the Motel Six, she'll understand...Yeah, I got a computer and you shouldn't touch it. It took me weeks to get it set up the way I want it and I don't want amateurs messing with it.No way! I'm not living in that zoo.Just leave Cleveland the way you found it. Burnett climbs in, waves out the window.He's dropping it off at the mechanic on the way to the airport. The engine needs an overhaul... or will by the time he gets there. The Porsche heads down the block with a GRINDING of GEARS. Lowrey winces and heads for the Volvo when Theresa gets in his way.-- that Marcus was supposed to do. That's right. Marcus. Not Mike. 'Cuz Mike's a cop on a case with no time to waste. Lowrey's in the Volvo and pulling away as fast as he can.Captain Howard, please. It's Lowrey.I just talked to Marcus. The girl just I.D.'d one of the shooters --Okay... Hang on, Cappy. This is Prudence and she has to go potty. This is a potty. Everyone has to poop and when they do they use the potty. Mommies poop. Daddies poop. Captain Howard poops. Even doggies poop.... so your daddy and I are trapped in this crack house in Little Havana. These dudes were real mean mothers... and they start coming at us with knives... Now I'm scared, thinkin' I'm out for the count when in comes your daddy like a Miami hurricane --Oh, hi, Theresa. Just tellin' the kids about --G'night, gang.If you were my wife I'd drink it.Just a harmless bedtime story. Thought the kids deserved to know about the hero they have for a dad.Husband? Theresa. He's your personal errand boy. You beep the poor S.O.B. every hour on the Goddamn hour? And why is it always about some useless bullshit that can wait until later. I mean, the guy's gotta job to do.Touche, Theresa.You should recognize trunk. It's the one you came to America in.Oh, please. Big fucking deal. You know what I had to do? I drove your kids to school this morning. Your son forgot his homework. So I had to drive him all the way back in that junker of yours -- What's that you're wearin'? Is that my new silk shirt? Is that my shirt?Ugh. I gotta call the wife.Yeah, what's up, baby. Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay. What else? You want me do what? Lowrey glances over at Burnett who's clearly loving the fact that it's Lowrey's turn at errand boy. So Lowrey...Mmm. Uh-huh. Hectic down here. I'll be in, nine. Nine-thirty. The kids alright? How's that potty thing? Yeah? Okay. Alright. Lowrey turns to block the phone, depressing the switch, but acting as if he's still on with Theresa.Say, why don't you rent a movie or somethin'? Uh-huh. You're so silly.So, baby. What you wearin'?Man, it's off. It was a joke.Marcus, this is crazy. We are five minutes away from picking up this asshole and returning to our lives. And we're here doin' this shit. Where the fuck is it?You're unbalanced. Listen, I read the parole jacket on this guy Noah. Armed robbery. Attempted murder. He's a violent offender somethin' like nine times. Sweet guy. Not a single drug bust on his sheet.You know, it is a damn shame she makes you buy this stuff.Terrible fuckin' job. It's like shaving cream. They're all the same. Fresh. Free. Confident. Secure. Super wide? What the fuck? We're takin' this one.Water and Power.I dunno. Maybe some kind of hurricane anchor. They knock again. The chain jerks slightly.We're undercover! Now, we're lookin' for the owner of that animal.Everglades. Only part of South Florida that's zoned for Wild Kingdom shit. 'Course, the crocks down there'll probably eat your brother's cat.Very nice. The occasion?What's that on the rug? Looks like... a stain? Teeth grit.And have you ever heard of a new invention called the 'coaster'? As he tries buffing the table with his sleeve.No. It's not my place. My wife. She's a designer. She decorated the whole place at a discount just for Mike. And when she hears about how he's been taking care of -- Off the couch! Lowrey chases the dogs into the bedroom. One of the dogs runs out with a Cole Hahn loafer in his mouth. They both follow him into the bedroom.'The hell's going on out here??Yvette!? You didn't just send away Yvette?You are ruining my life!I say we split the room in half. Make our own moves. Hook back up at the bar in twenty minutes.Anything?What the hell are you doing here?Well, whatever he said, you remember to tell me later.The music's too loud. What you say about angels? Noah closes the gap. Through the crowd he draws down on Lowrey.Launches himself off a nearby table, soars over the frightened crowd and comes crashing down upon Noah. Both Lowrey and Noah tumble to the floor. Noah's gun skitters into the crowd. Noah chases for it, but can't find it. But --No shit!Lemme drive!You're gonna drive through that, aren't you? Burnett does, hauling through the light. Meanwhile, Lowrey has the bubble light in hand, reaches out the window to stick it on the roof, but it simply slides off. He reels it back in the car and hands it off to Julie.Hold that.C'mon, lemme drive --Hey, hey. Just relax! Okay. It's true this whole thing started with missing drugs. But somebody I cared about. A lot. She got killed. And I'm not gonna lay down until this guy is dead or put away... And I promise you, we'll take care of you.Hey. What do I gotta say? I need you, okay? I need you. Magic words. Julie's swayed, despite herself.Nah. Some smooth shit I got on my own. He puts his arm around her and they walk back.Smells like some kinda chemical.One day, bro. Gotta get yourself some of them. Lowrey hears SOBBING. He gently shuts the kids' door and heads down the hall to the:Hey, hey. That's not cryin' I hear.Theresa. Listen to me. Nobody's slipping away from you. Especially not Marcus. You can take my word on that... As for the clothes... Lowrey pulls a random item out of a box. It's hideous.Okay. Just a minor fashion faux paux. Those cappuccinos at lunch can do that to you... See what else we got here.That's right. Turn around. Theresa turns, looking transformed in the outfit put together by Lowery.Want to? Baby. Someone I know's gonna burn you right to the ground. Get ready! You're on the mic with Mike... Hello?G'night, everybody. Lowrey's at the window. Parked just down the street is the same sedan. He goes for the phone and dials. Waits for an answer.Hey, Sanchez. It's me Lowrey... Yeah? Same to you, pal. But listen. I got something you'll want a piece of.What's the matter?Go into the kids' room, turn the lights out and wait there until I come get you.Marcus! What the fuck --What? Me and Theresa?This whole deal has turned you stupid. You're seeing things that aren't there.I'm fine, Theresa! Will you get the hell out of here before she sees you! You're supposed to be in Cleveland.And where's Julie? You didn't leave her again.Now, listen to me. Look over my right shoulder. What do you see ... I said look!Good. So who do you think's in there? Ed McMahon come to tell us we're sweepstakes winners?We're doing nothing. I've got it handled. In the meantime, you better get back to where you belong before I shoot you myself.Wait a minute. That's my desk! Lowrey's going to make a move on Sinclair when Howard appears.Insert substance... Highly volatile drying agent? The greedy motherfucker! He's cutting the dope.Or one really smart sonofabitch.Good runnin' into you, Jojo.Man, it's a good thing you got your memory workin'. Cuz that dead man paperwork is a bitch.Man. Will you get off this? You're making me sick.Yeah. Somethin' yummy.Oh, man. It's the fuckin' pretend police.Excuse me. One moment. Let's fuck with these bozos. Burnett nods his approval. Lowrey lowers the window.Now, where were we?Whoah. You better watch it, fellahs! You know, it would be very bad if you shot and killed two helpless pimps and a call girl... But it would be even worse if you shot two policemen and their witness on a stakeout. Looks pass between the hobby cops.Now I'm reaching slowly for my shield... very slowly... here it comes... just about got it... Ooh, look at that. It's a detective's shield! All gold and shiny. A smart fellah wouldn't fuck with somebody who had one of these in his pocket. So... Let's see. I guess that makes us policemen. And you...I don't worry. They're in good hands.I'm on him. Hey, buckle up back there.You're gonna keep your sweet ass nice and quiet back at my place.Mike's place. I said Mike's. Lowrey rolls his eyes. He can't wait for this to end.That's the plan... So, Mike. Loan some of those ass kicking clothes.Man, I can't wait to see the look on Howard's face when we tell him... Holy shit! Hi, Theresa... honey.Mike what? What'd he do?Where's Julie? Lowrey pushes past Theresa into --Julie. We wanted to tell you... I especially wanted to tell you --Julie --We still need you. He reaches for her.Julie! Drop now! Pandemonium.Slips behind a pillar as BULLETS WHIZ past.Swings around the pillar, gun leveled and running after them.Julie!!!! Meanwhile --enters. He dives to the floor as Casper stops and FIRES. BULLETS RIP through the salon walls and mirrors. Lowrey ends up under an old lady's dress.Don't ever say I wasn't there for you.At least I'm me again. I'm Lowrey. From his back pocket, the boy extracts a cellular flip PHONE. He hands it to Lowrey. He presses the power button and, almost instantly, it RINGS.Yeah. This is Lowrey.You twisted motherfucker... Jojo, you sonofabitch. When I get my hands on you, I swear, I'm gonna kill you. The snitch who tipped us to the dope lab? Turns out to be a bogus address.You know that once he sells the dope, he's gonna kill her just like he did Max.If she dies, I'm done with it. The whole cop thing.So you were alone?Yeah. But does he still trust what you tell him?Move it or lose it! Burnett and Lowrey climb from the dumpster and run. Casper and Ferguson have a clear shot. They level and aim, but...Julie!Either we O.D. on the air or the whole place blows. We're dying anyway.Drop, Julie! She drops. Burnett has a clear shot when --Don't shoot!!! Hold your fire!!!Stick around. I'll give you a bullet to bite. Finally --Manana, partner. Peace. Okay, kids. Pile in.

Get off after you get off? All three of them laugh.Lowrey! Burnett stomps the bad guy's instep. The guy buckles. Burnett rolls away and stands in front of a window, just in time to see the angry Dominican heading straight for him.Nice backup.We're always saying we should spend more quality time together. Well, I got the time... and you got the quality... She laughs. He kisses her.I can remember when we used to do it every morning.Been over a week since I've had some quality time!Kids, knock it off... or your momma's gonna whoop your butts! Theresa laughs in spite of herself as the kids continue to fight. Into this craziness enters Mike Lowrey...Hey, Dick. How many times I gotta tell you? I don't work robbery. I'm in Narcotics. Meanwhile, Lowrey's holding the car door open as the kids pile into the jump seat in the back.Oh, baby. Damn. Lowrey shakes his head.Twins?What special effects?Your kids are lookin' sharp, Francine. She smiles.And the women really go for that. Really, they do. As Burnett and Lowrey duck the tape, they note a very groggy O'Fee over in the corner being attended by a paramedic team. He's still out cold. An oh shit look passes between the two partners.This can't be happening.How's O'Fee?Because maybe this guy knows if you kill a cop the whole department'll get up his ass hard and fast.You're not sayin' this was an inside job. Cops wouldn't pull this shit.What about the air conditioning?What do you think?Why me?Don't say nothin' about my clothes. I paid for these.Not on a cop's salary.Yeah. I got some weird track marks in here. Then Burnett notes a manufacturing stamp at the joint. It reads: ORONA AIR CONTITIONING SYSTEMS, INC.There's gonna be a lotta cash when the dope hits the street. We want you to put the word out through your bank and hustle the account. You help us, maybe we can see about getting those R.T.C. auditors off your ass.Not a fucking lead. So now that we've done the obvious, we need a shortcut.Huh uh. Not this time. I'm tired of you working pussy into everything we do.Huh?A cop.You know? I'm a cop. I shot somebody just last week. Didn't kill him, just shot him in the ass. Stone cold looks from them all. They walk away with Burnett giving a \"what did I say\" look. Lowrey appears.Green ain't the color I was thinkin' of. More of a coco puff. Just real shiny, thick...Damn! The woman's got fuckin' radar on my ass. Sensed me lookin' at another woman. Bet she wants me to pick up Huggies 'stead of those baby Garanimals that they wear.And I plan on living to be old just like 'em. Rubbin' Ben Gay on my joints and everythin'.I don't have a death wish like you. I got a family that counts on me. A mortgage to pay. And I'm not sayin' it's me, but most of the guys in the station think you're some rich kid playin' cop.I love you, man. He lets loose a big grin.Well, we can leave a note or we can break and enter --Aw, man. Did you cut one?Not me. Lowrey and Burnett look at each other and draw guns.Where are the drugs? Where... are... the... drugs? He ain't sayin' nothin'. He must be guilty of somethin'. Meanwhile, Lowrey's got no problem with the dead body. He tries opening a desk drawer, but Orona's rigor mortis- stiffened knee is in the way. So Lowrey gives it a shove and the chair swivels. Orona's dead arm sweeps the lamp off the desk.Whoa. Watch where you're swinging them dead arms, Orona. You're gonna fuck up your own crime scene.Watch what you touch. That's evidence.Not touching. Browsing... Mr. Orona. You've got the right to remain silent. Anything you say'll surprise the shit out of us.Anything?Lemme guess. Guy does the air conditioning contract for the P.D. He'd have the plans.Works for me. Now can we go? I'm gonna puke.Looks like you're already doing that. Burnett's quick to point out the trail of bloody foot- prints Ruiz just tracked across the carpet.He drops the sheet on Eddie's body, then moves over to Max's. He doesn't know it's her until --Jesus, no...I wouldn't fuck with him right now.Uh oh... Alright, you check out Lois, then check in --Following this Lois Fields lead. I just paged him.No, Theresa... No, he wasn't talking about you.Theresa, I know it was my idea. I know I was the one who wanted a little quality time. It's just that this can't wait. Can't I just wake you up when I get home?Theresa. I gotta go. Burnett hangs up and redials Lowrey's pager.I can't be Lowrey.Yo, you are live with Lowrey... Yo, you're live with Lowrey.Mike Lowrey. INTERCUT WITH:... 'Cuz I'm Mike Lowrey. I'm a cop. Wanna see my badge?Hey, lady. You called me, remember...? 'On the mike with Mike.' After a beat, the door swings ajar.What the fuck was that for?What do you mean I'm not Mike Lowrey? You never even met him! Me.I'm undercover. She doesn't believe him and swings the bat.Okay. I'm way undercover.I knew her from way back. From time to time, you know... We'd get together. Mess around, you know?Okay. Okay. So I exaggerated. It's a man thing. She swings again, but he's had enough, he moves quickly, catching the bat with his hand and ripping it away from her.You know what? You don't wanna believe me? That's fine with me! Go it alone. Burnett heads toward the open door. Julie's veneer drops as she shrinks to the floor.You don't got any more golf clubs or bats, do you? Nothin' that you can swing at me, do you? She shakes her head. He carefully steps forward.Then lemme introduce myself. I'm Mike Lowrey. And I'm here to help you.Yeah, well neither are you. You swing like Barry Bonds. Burnett nods and crosses over to help Julie to her feet.Alright. Look here, I need to know if you've called anybody. Or if you told anybody else where you are?Good. You got a back door? Julie nods, scoops up one of her dogs and grabbing another modeling bag off the table.Protective custody.Let's go!Fuck the dog! Burnett sees the second dog cowering in the corner. So he lunges over, scoops the dog up. CUT TO:Fine time to bark. Where were you when they were comin' up the walk? Shit. Bet they got a look at my license plates. If you saw him again, would you remember the guy who shot Max?I told you, I'm putting you into protective custody...Yeah. I noticed.Fine. So what do you want to do? Where will you feel safe?My place? Okay, good. No, wait. My place is wrong.I mean right. As in good. My place is good. We'll go there first. My place.Wait here.He told me I could use the place tonight...Here. And if that's not enough, I'm gonna run you in for extortion.I forgot I had those switches moved. Welcome to Casa del Lowrey. Julie enters, looking left and right, cautious but impressed by the stylish digs.I uh... I invest.-- My father invests... Listen. You must be tired --Fair enough. I'm not on the take. Satisfied? Good. So... why don't you make yourself at home? Here's the T.V. remote. Watch yourself some 'Gilligan's Island' reruns or somethin'. Hits \"ON\" button. Instead of TV, the room immediately becomes a seduction den: lights dim, romantic music.Heh -- all these damn things look alike. Well, gotta run... There's probably a couple of good steaks in the fridge for the dogs. Help yourself to whatever. I'll check on you in the morning.Uh, back to the P.D. I got paperwork back on my desk to go through that's about this high. And now there's you, so that makes it this high. To his neck.Why shouldn't I? Are you a thief or a vandal?I didn't ask.Okay. Important lesson. Julie's not a call girl. Can I go now?Don't mention it. Burnett tries to break toward the door when the PHONE RINGS. Burnett stares at the phone, not knowing what to do.It's uh... It's uh...Lock the door. Don't open it for anybody.Listen, Chet. The girl? She's a witness. I'm gonna be gone for about an hour. Do me a favor. Keep your eye out, okay?Just keep an eye out. Heads for the door.-- I swear, baby, it's nothing. I was on the job -- As she gets to the bedroom, Doris wheels around --No! No! I got it right here...If you were a real partner, instead of some no-backup, hot doggin', car chasin', skirt sniffin' motherfucker, I would be gettin' down to business with my wife instead of stuck in this situation.Chief. I tried to set the girl up with a sketch artist but she won't. I tried to get her to come in and look at the mug books and she won't come in.That's right. So let her deal with the real Mike Lowrey! Who, I might add, shoulda been there to take the call instead of runnin' off like a hot dog without any backup. Howard fires another missed shot. He's so bad, it's all Burnett and Lowrey can do to keep from spiking the ball.I had to stash her somewhere! She's scared shitless... just like her dogs.Big computer. Expensive --So what about me? I can't tell my wife I'm shacked up with a female witness! Besides, I think they made my car last night... I gotta stay close to home, just in case.My house ain't no zoo!Cleveland's where they collared the dealer. And that's where I gotta go to testify.Honey. I wouldn't go if I didn't have the most trustworthy man I know to look after my family...Yes, Lowrey. I trust him with my life and, I most certainly trust him with yours.Baby. It's a Federal subpoena. I'm the witness. I'm the one who has to testify. Case closed. I'm the one going to Cleveland. Lowrey's staying here.Don't forget to put Snail Guard on my lawn.Bye-bye, Theresa. Be good, kids. Lowrey joins Theresa on the porch. Mockingly he puts his arm around her and waves.Julie!Yeah. It's me. Mike.Crazy fuckin' woman. He steps from the bathroom and stands outside the door.Special Narcotics Division.We find the dope, we find our shooter, too.Man, when this is over, I'm gonna get me somethin' better than quality time. It's gonna be me'n Theresa on a boat --Mug shots. We got mug shots to look at. 'Scuse me, I gotta hook into the P.D. computer. He heads out of the bedroom.That guy? Well, that's Marcus Burnett, my partner. Burnett gets closer and must look around until he finds the singular photo of the two of them. It's in a shitty frame, too.There's the two of us, see? Me'n'... ... My partner.Yeah. Okay. Sure, I can see how it looks that way... But you see... you see... It's uh... a cop thing. That's because I've put a picture up there for every time Marcus has saved my life.I save his life. He saves mine. He's got the same thing in his house. Pictures of me. More, even. Good family man, that Marcus.Me? Gay? Are you outta your mind?It's a good thing that I'm secure in my manhood to see that you don't mean that. You know how many women I've had in that waterbed? Check the waves as they go by. Count 'em. Now, mug shots?The shooter said four days until he makes the deal. What else did he say?Just a few more and we can take another break.A what?What had a name.It's just bologna.You sure? Julie nods. She's certain.Your dog took a shit.Lemon Pledge.You cleaned my clothes?You cleaned my clothes? He's all appreciative until he notices something dis- turbing. A shirt of his has a large bleached area on it.What's this??This is my favorite shirt. My lucky shirt.Not going to happen.Slab of fear?Alright. I left my wallet at the office so I'll give you some cash tomorrow.I'm tellin' you, I've had it with this witness. I wanna go home and get back to my life as it was. I got married so I could stop lyin'.Yeah. I know, it's a little big on me. But cool. I figure, what about it? If I'm gonna be Mike, might as well dress like Mike! I wanna be, I wanna be like Mike. Swish. Lowrey's BEEPER SOUNDS. He checks out the number.The wife? Lowrey finds the nearest phone and dials. Burnett is thinking Theresa?Gimme that phone. Hello, Theresa? Theresa!Hey, man. Don't mess with me! That's the mother of my children. Don't break up a happy home.Hey. Don't ask me to find it for you. You're the expert on my wife.You don't even know where you're going. You're in the wrong aisle. Lowrey follows Burnett to the next aisle, where Burnett gestures to the wall of feminine hygiene products.You think you know what Theresa needs, man, but I do this every month. Just look for 'Fresh Days.' Lowrey moves ahead. There's too much to look at.So? He's a new recruit. Keep looking, will ya? 'Fresh Days.'Hey, this what husband's do.Hey, man, look! You're not even reading. These are panty liners, okay? A woman chooses this moment to walk by.That's a whole 'nother category of thing! Man, for a guy that spends all his time chasing pussy, you sure don't know much about the woo woo. Here it is. Fresh Days. You pay for it.What are we gonna be today? Postal Inspectors or Water and Power?What do you think the chain's for?Well, the anchor just moved. Both turn and look. And the chain is moving. At first, it simply sways back and forth, then it pulls taut and the FRIDGE JOLTS! A deep, GUTTURAL NOISE sounds. From around the corner, a shadow grows large. Lowrey and Burnett instinctively withdraw their guns and aim just as a LION rounds the corner, teeth bared, claws tearing at the deck. The door swings open. Burnett pushes Lowrey inside just as the big cat lunges.AAAAAAAAAAA-Animal Control!That's too bad. Because his lion's tied to your trailer. So you gotta move the beast. Or move the trailer.Well, little kitty's gonna be gator bait 'less you suddenly remember where your brother is. By the look on her face, her memory is coming back.It's me, Julie... Julie enters from the bedroom, dressed in something hot with the tag still hanging from a sleeve.Yes. We were going to a club. As in me and my partner.What?How did you get in here? Julie and Lowrey return from the bedroom.Maybe you should call first next time. What's your name?You don't quit stalking me, Yvette, I'm gonna place your ass under arrest! -- 'Bye! Burnett slams the door. She's SCREAMING on the other side, POUNDING the door with her fists, and cursing in mad Spanish. Finally she stomps off down the hall.Just that crazy Yvette, stalking me again. Lowrey could kill.That woman's into some weird shit. Julie's confused, to say the least.We, as in Marcus and I, are going to Club Hell. We're gonna nail this Noah guy and get him to give up Max's shooter. Anyone got a problem with that?Yeah, well this case is messin' with mine, too.Sounds good to me. Lowrey moves off and Burnett turns to the femaleBartender says he works here. But she hasn't seen him all night. I gotta make a pitstop.Oh, man. Budweiser...Musta drank about a million Budweisers tonight, waitin' for my ol' friend Noah to show. Wouldn't know him, would ya? Guy practically raised me up from nothin'.Too bad. Burnett shrugs, zips and reaches to flush when --Next time, learn how to work the safety with your punk ass. Now where's my no good, no back-up partner? Through the busted fishtank, Burnett catches sight of Lowrey, standing at the bar and making conversation with one of the club beauties.Don't even think about it. Julie? CUT TO:I'm driving. Buckle up. Burnett hits the gas, the CAR SCREAMS around in a tight circle just as -- SLAM! -- Noah's sedan backs wildly across the road and crunches them. Noah throws a SHOTGUN over the back seat of his car and FIRES through the rear window. BLAM! Everybody ducks. Safety glass flies before Noah shifts gears and drives on.Do I backseat drive when you're tailing a hitman?There goes our only lead to the dope. We better call Howard.Jesus. What kinda shit was in there?We'll get a sample and drop it back at the lab. Meanwhile, why don't you two go on back to Club Hell and see what you can dig up on these bad guys.That's perfectly alright -- Julie suddenly flops on the bed, wearing a gorgeous nightgown.Sure.I'm on protective duty. And I want you to feel... protected. So I'm dressed and ready. It's okay. I've done it before.Sure he would. It's a cop thing.You do?Well, I drove.I shot the gas tank on the car.Theresa. Why?What's that supposed to mean?Funny?Yeah... I feel a little funny.What kind of funny?I gotta call Marcus. Burnett's out of bed like a shot and headed for the living room.I'm different. I'm a cop. And now I gotta kill a guy.I got some jewelry for you. Before Julie can respond, Burnett's cuffing her to the steering wheel.Just shut the fuck up. I won't be long. Try and keep out of sight. Burnett's out of the car with the keys. Julie yanks on the handcuffs, then goes for the glove box. But this time it's empty.falls. Landing flat on his back on the awning. His eyes close with a look that says \"saved.\" But then as he moves. Something CREAKS.... You doin' Theresa? Theresa!I hope you used protection... 'cause I don't want a fourth kid that looks like you!And I suppose this isn't here? You were going to put Snail Guard on the lawn, remember?Yeah, I wouldn't want to spoil your little arrangement!She's in the car. Got her cuffed to the steering wheel. Lowrey could kill now. He's on his feet, grabbing Burnett by the collar and shoving him up against the front door.Late model Ford. Two occupants.Okay. What are we doing about it?Hey. What's goin' on here?Yeah. I guess you're tellin' the truth.Yeah, but Julie told me his ship comes in on Friday? You wanna tell me who can cut a hundred mil worth a dope in five days? You'd need whole lotta time cards to make that kinda date.Hey, Jojo. Through the office window, Jojo sees Burnett and sud- denly bolts out the rear door and runs smack dab into Lowrey, who body checks him back up against the office door.Hey, calm down. A little rap, that's all. We're lookin' for someone who can step on a shitload of heroin. And do it real fast, and real well. We're lookin' for a pro.We're not playin' around with you, Jojo. You know what we want.Now there's a lotta dope, Jojo. Who can cut it quick?What are you doin', man? As Burnett tries to intercede, they talk over each other.Remember, partner. He's no good to us if you splatter his ass.What?Listen, lady -- But Burnett's face ignites with headlights at their rear. Doors open. Lowrey checks the rear-view mirror. He sees two private security cops named DE SOUZA and TOWNE. They split and approach either side of the unmarked sedan.Be nice. After tomorrow we might need 'em for a job reference. Lowrey rolls down his driver's window in time to hear...Oh, that's not how you frisk a potential lawbreaker. You gotta start at the waistband. See if he's carrying a piece. Towne stalls a beat, then self-consciously goes to Burnett's waistband where he feels a --Not. He shows his shield. Both hobby cops lower their guns, unsure about what's next. Burnett moves in.Now, some rent-a-cops have licenses to carry weapons, where others do not. Which might you be? You wouldn't happen to have those permits handy, would you? From the looks on the hobby cops' faces, Julie can see that they don't.I bet you miss your wife, kids... I bet you miss them a whole lot.Two o'clock. The red Civic.Let's just hope he didn't come home for a nap. TIME CUT TO:They've made us. Let's move. Lowrey FLOORS it.Yeah. Tell Howard to assemble the troops. We just made the dope lab. We'll be at the P.D. in one hour.Third drawer down. Hey, Julie. Do me a favor and see who that is.Theresa. It's not how it looks.Theresa. She's a material witness! It was orders!Pushes Theresa back into the elevator, making her lay on the floor as BULLETS CUT above.Go upstairs. And don't let anybody in but me... Do it! Burnett presses the close door button. The doors close just as Theresa reaches for him, calling --We lost the girl.Bogus address?How'd he know we were gearing up to go? It's like he's known all along where we're gonna be and when.Three little angels. Julie kept talking about his three little angels. A barkeeper appears with two beers. Burnett automati- cally reaches for his wallet.Three little angels.He wanted someone inside the P.D.?Anything you can tell us about him?Call Howard. Tell him we're gonna need lotsa back-up.We can make better time if we cut across the Biscayne Bridge.That's it. That's where they're making the deal. Burnett swivels the spotting scope.Mouths shut, feet moving. Now, walk.Let her go and you'll walk. You can keep the dope and the money. Just the girl and we all get out of here.Sanchez and Ruiz... Then --Hey, hey... Let's go get our jobs back.Daddy's home! Behind Burnett appear Lowrey and Julie, arm in arm. The kids run to...Baby! Theresa framed in the front doorway, looking smashing in the outfit Lowrey picked out for her. Burnett ambles up the walk into her arms. They hug and kiss, Theresa tossing a wink Lowrey's way.Hey.

{"raw_line": "Marcus, what are you doing?That was how we got a three bedroom house filled with little Burnetts. She crawls from bed.Quincy, never-you-mind. And take those things off in the house! Jill, stop with the book and eat your breakfast. Marcus, why do I always have to discipline the kids? You play bad cop for a second. Alongside the kitchen screen door we see Lowrey's PORSCHE ROAR to a stop in the driveway.Don't kiss me, Lowrey. I don't know where those lips were last night.Don't go tellin' my son about your sleazy sex life?I don't want him knowing about it either! Gives him ideas. Hello? Oh, sure. Which one of them do you want? Lowrey accepts the phone from Theresa and talks.Not so fast. You were going to take the kids to school today, remember, hon? I have a job interview... Lowrey rolls his eyes.Marcus... I need you to stop at Save-More on the way home and pick up exactly what's on the list. She hands Burnett a long list.You never had to go to Cleveland on police business before.But what about us? The neighborhood's had all break-ins. I won't feel safe if you're --Oh, no, Not Lowrey. Not in my house.Why don't they send him to Cleveland?Why's he taking your car?Where you think you're going? I got a list here of things that Marcus was supposed --Standing in the doorway. Hands on her hips.Thank you, but I'll tuck the kids in. Say good night to Uncle Mike.If you were my husband, I'd poison that.Twelve years I'm married, Michael. And I never let Marcus bring his work home.We don't need any violence in this household and we certainly don't need any more heroes. What we need is a father and a husband.You wanna know why I page him? Because until that phone rings, I don't know whether he's dead or alive. And lemme tell you. Those three minutes I'm waiting for him to call back? Those are the hardest three minutes for a cop's wife.Sheets and pillows are in the hope chest. I'll see you in the morning.Oh, it's nothing... I just bought some clothes. It's been so long since I bought anything nice... I just wanted something to wear for Marcus when he got home. But nothing looks right... He's slipping away from me, Mike. I can feel it.You think he'll like it? I mean, I want him to, you know, want to...Yeah. Good night, Uncle Mike.Mike! In a heartbeat, Lowrey charges into Theresa's room in his underwear.I heard a noise... I think someone's outside...Mike? Are you okay!Kids, you go over to the neighbors' house. I'll be right back.Mommy's going to Cleveland.Announce this! In a motherly flash, she's got Chet by the ear and she's dragging him over to the elevator. He yowls the whole way until he sticks his master pass-card in the elevator lock. Theresa lets go.Oh, I got plenty in me to kill 'em both. But it's the short one I'm gonna divorce. She pushes past.Save your crap, Mike.It ain't Cleveland, neither.You stayed away from home just one night too many, Marcus.Marcus, I love you.Didn't you know? We got us a new babysitter.

The biggest dope bust in the history of this department up and walked out of this locker, along with maybe my job and the two of yours if we don't get the shit back.So here's what we're gonna do. Since it was originally your case, you two guys are on point. Sanchez and Ruiz, you back them up with whatever they need. Groans all around.Name's Sinclair. Internal Affairs. He's our new proctologist.Enough. I.A.'s in it and there's nothing we can do about it. If any of this leaks, the shit's gonna hit our biggest fan. Remember him? The mayor? He created us and you can bet your jobs, boys, he'll rip us into little cop pieces. I figure we got seventy-two hours to find the dope and keep our jobs.So what about it?Nice and cool up there, Burnett? Comfy? Maybe there's a new career for you in building maintenance.Two dead. A hood registered as Eddie Dominguez and some Jane Doe. But the table over there's covered in high-grade dope. Sound familiar?Did you check parole? How about F.B.I. or D.E.A.? They're supposed to be compliant with our requests? And where the hell's Lowrey?The madame? What's it with this guy? It's always girls, girls, girls.It's about fuckin' time. Howard here. INTERCUT WITH:He's not here. How can I help you?This isn't another paternity case, is it?Did this happen at the Biltmore Hotel?Don't hang up. Lemme find him. Page Lowrey. Find out where he is!Don't leave town. Please, and don't hang up. I've got Lowrey right here. He just walked in. Be Lowrey.Shut up and listen! She'll only talk to Lowrey. She says she's our witness. That means she's our only link to the dope, not to mention my pension plan, so get on the phone. Burnett accepts the phone. Hand over the receiver, he does a quick Lowrey impression that starts as lame and ends pretty damn convincing.She'll only deal with Mike Lowrey. He tosses a brick.Not a good idea. Until she I.D.s the shotters, he's Mike Lowrey. Could take a coupla hours. Could take all day. You got a computer with a modem?Burnett. I'll have Francine give you the user code for the computer files and you can run pictures for the girl on Lowrey's super duper computer.Easy. Lowrey moves into your house. And you're on special assignment. Another brick.Enough! You're him, he's you! Until she makes the shooters and we get the dope back, I don't care what you have to do, just make it work! Lowrey and Burnett feel hammered by Howard. Upon retrieving his final brick, Lowrey passes to Burnett, who feeds back Lowrey with a heel kick to the rim. And Lowrey slams the ball home. They exit with Howard simply staring.I also got the lab report from the stuff you picked up in Noah's trunk. He hands it off.We're in the shit, boys. And there ain't gonna be any more time cards for this unit unless somebody pulls a miracle out of their ass.It's about fuckin' time.But you found the dope, right? So let's go get it back. A bicycle BELL RINGS. Heads turn. And here comes a BOY on his bike, serpentining his way through the maze of cars and cops until he gets to Lowrey, Burnett, and Howard.How's this? I'll kill the little prick for you. That's cuz you're already dead. Okay, you guys. Put 'em back in the lockers.Swish.

So what'd I miss?Bad moods after a bad round of golf... I had blonde hair, then.Sex addict. Coke addict. Redhead.Only for two days. It wasn't even a phase.Oooh. Bad loser and bad, bad blonde. Farrah, frosted kinda big bad blonde. Oooh. Max laughs.But that's my point. I remember my hair phases more than I remember the men. So, a party in a Biltmore Hotel suite? Yeah, that'll really rock.A favor?Mike Lowrey. Not again. Will you just have sex with the man and get it over with.Yeah, right. You're in love.Well, I don't date cops. They never have enough money and they're always too tired to screw.Excuse me? I need to use the bathroom. Julie crosses to the bathroom.I need to talk to Detective Lowrey!You can get me Detective Lowrey!No. It's another murder case.Listen! I just saw my best friend murdered. I'm soaking wet. I'm alone, I'm scared and I'll only talk to Mike Lowrey!I don't want to come downtown! I don't want police protection! If you can't gimme Detective Lowrey I'm just gonna blow town! INTERCUT WITH:Who's there?How do I know it's Detective Lowrey?Yes! I wanna see it now! I'm not letting you through the fucking door until I do. Hold it up to the peephole! Burnett shows his shield. Holds it up to the peephole.Anybody can get one of those.You're not Mike Lowrey!The way Max described you was different.Prove it!Wrong. Julie swings for real, nearly taking Burnett's head off.I saw it all... I watched him shoot her. Like she was nothing. Please shut the door.You're not what I expected.No. Nobody.Where are we going? Duke!Whoa! Fuck that. I'll only deal with you. Otherwise, I'll take my chances. Burnett's getting a \"not again\" look on his face when --Luke?! Where's my other dog?!All I remember is one of them had really bad hair. Where are we going?No way. Listen, no offense, but I don't trust anybody.I didn't really think about it. I guess it's your place or a plane ticket. Your place is cheaper. So you choose.Wrong?Nice... very nice. All this on a cop's salary?Right. What was your last pick? A horse in the number two race at Pimlico? Or did a bookie give you an inside tip.I'll ask you this only once, Mike. Are you on the take? And if you say no and I discover you're lying to me, I'll walk. Are we clear?Where are you going?You mean, you're going to leave me alone? In your place. With all your stuff?Of course not. And I'm not a call girl, either.I know you didn't. I just thought you should know.Just one more thing. Julie steps forward and wraps her arms around Burnett. It's a one-way hug. Uncomfortable, Burnett doesn't reciprocate other than a palsy pat on the back.Thank you. For everything.Aren't you going to --You don't have to explain. Finally, they've reached consensus. Burnett grins and is out the door.That you, Mike?At least your timing's good. Can you bring me the lotion on the nightstand? Burnett enters. Julie has a towel wrapped around her body.Thanks. So I was thinking... Julie, obviously free with her body, suddenly drops the towel and starts applying lotion. Burnett averts his eyes, turning around a full one-eighty, but finds himself facing a mirror. Oops. Looks left, another shiny surface. Shit.The guy who killed Max. Now, he was looking for the heroin that Eddie stole from him... Max went to the party as a favor to you. You're a dope cop, right?So this isn't about Max's death at all. It's about dope.There's some powder in there, too. Can you hand that to me? Mike? Mike? Burnett has disappeared into... TIME CUT TO:Mike? I borrowed a T-shirt and some boxer shorts until we can somehow get back over to my place to pick up some clothes.Hey, Mike. Who's the guy in all the pictures? Burnett turns. And there behind Julie is a wall full of photos that he's never, ever noticed. Nearly all of Lowrey. All ego.Listen, Mike. I've known a lotta guys. And I've seen a good number of their bedrooms, okay? But I've never seen... I mean, look at it. It's like a shrine to him.Saved your life?Okay, but Mike. This is like a lot of pictures. I mean, this isn't something by the bedstand. This is a whole wall... And I know Max said you were just friends. That's why I was thinking, maybe... you could be... gay. Burnett reacts, then recovers with...I didn't mean to offend you.Somethin' weird. Sounded like three angels... He wasn't worried because he had three little angels on his shoulders tellin' him something. I didn't get the rest. I'm getting tired of looking at ugly people.I don't wanna take a break. Then we'd have to talk and I got nothing to say to a cannibal.That was a living, breathing consciousness. It felt joy. Sadness. Maybe it even had a name.That flesh you're shoveling into your mouth.It was alive. Some farmer fed it. Got it to trust him. Then blew its brains out, dumped it in a cement mixer with a ton of carcinogens and now you're eating it.No. At least finish it so I won't have to look at it. Let's look at some more ugly people.Wait. Hold it. Go back... That's him! That's one of 'em.And you used Pledge to clean it up?Well, that makes a big difference. You just varnished that into the fabric. I'm sure it works great. Burnett doesn't quite know what to do with the wad of dog poop in paper towels still in his hand. Julie snatches it from him and heads for the bathroom. Burnett follows. He suddenly realizes that the clean clothes are his.I just threw them in with mine.I had a little accident.Sorry. As Burnett starts to walk away...Listen, Mike. I don't have any of my clothes. I wanna go back to my place to get some.I need apparel. That and I need some food that's something more than a cold, slab of fear.All you got in the place are frozen steaks.I'll be ready in just a minute. I thought I'd have you tell -- She stalls at the sight of Lowrey, a little spark of interest passes between them.Hi. I'm Julie. You must be Marcus. I recognize you from all the photographs. Nice to meet you. What do you think?He said we were going to a club tonight.Oh, that's fuckin' swell! And you call this protective custody? I'm here all day. I'm alone and scared. And all I got to protect me is Chet the doorman --It was my babies, Luke and Duke. They get nervous in new surroundings. I offered to pay for the cleaning, but Mike wouldn't hear of it -- Lowrey spots rings from glasses on the table.Marcus, you act like it's your place.So, Mike. Any other spontaneous naked women with keys, that we should know about?I feel safer now. She turns and exits back into the bedroom. Burnett's about to follow when Lowrey swings him outside the door- way and gets into his face.The guy who killed Max. I remember something he said!Three little angels! The guy who killed Max said 'three little -- Julie sees Noah and freezes.as she grabs Lowrey.That's him!Just getting out of the car as the station blows. They shield themselves against the explosion.That's it. That's it. You're both crazy. Julie takes a few steps away before she decides to give them the other barrel.Protect and serve. Sound familiar? Isn't that what you're supposed to do? 'Cuz I'd like to know whose butt you're protecting.All you care about is getting your dope back. No, that's not all, you care about getting it back in a way that shows how fucking macho and tough you are. It's all some big testosterone contest. Well, fuck that. As Julie walks in one direction, Burnett blows off in the other.That's what I'm afraid of. Once again, Julie pulls away. But Lowrey's got her tight... and close. He digs deep.Do they teach charm at the academy?I'm really sorry about the dog pee. They must be traumatized by the new surroundings. I'll pay for new cushions.So, Mike. Can I ask you something?Do you always come to bed with your clothes on? Or just when there's a woman in it?Really. You think Marcus would wear clothes to bed while on protective duty?Oh, I definitely have a cop thing, too.Well Marcus. He's very something ... sexy. And the way I came in tonight, he was throwing everybody this way and that and he took control.I know. You drove well.That's right, you did. And it was exciting... But Marcus... Something about him... His wife. What's her name?I'll bet Theresa is takin' care of business right now.You know, relieve his tension. A woman'll do anything to keep a man like that. You know what I mean? Tonight... made me a little bit horny, I guess. I think, maybe. It was the car chase. Or the guns and everything. I've never shot a gun before. Maybe it's the steel or something. I'm feeling a little... funny.I don't know. Do you feel a little funny?Not that kind of funny.You know... Funny.Usually the guy throws me out after he fucks me.You prick! First you don't want me. Then you drag me out...Oh, wait. I get it. You're one of those post-adolescent assholes who didn't get any car sex in high school --I'm getting really tired of this shit!So where's the coffee and donuts?I thought that was the usual menu when cops were on stakeout. A little caffeine for the heart. Some sugar-coated dough fried in day old grease.Oh, I'm sorry, Marcus. All these hours on the case, you must miss Theresa's home cooking. Bet last night she fixed you up something yummy and left it in the microwave for you. Burnett starts to steam.I imagine there was something yummy waiting for you when you finally made it to bed --Guess we know the answer to that one.Wha...? Lowrey has the keys in the ignition and is stomping on the gas.So what am I gonna do?What?Where you going?So, I guess when you get back, it's gonna be over.Which one do you want? The tall one or the short one?Thought so. Julie watches Theresa charge headlong into --You think I didn't know? God, you are so stupid! And to think I let you use me like you did, Max. Why?Wait. I know why. Because you said you needed me. Jesus, who's the stupid one now?Fuck you! Julie slams a fist into Lowrey's face. The elevator doors shut. Then Burnett comes hauling down the corridor with Theresa at his heels. He pounds the elevator button.On floor. In the middle. Crawling for cover when --I forget the formula. Big gun, big dick? No. Little gun, big dick? No. Big gun, little dick? Yeah. Yeah. I think that's it.Michael! Her VOICE ECHOES.He threw it in the --Ow.
