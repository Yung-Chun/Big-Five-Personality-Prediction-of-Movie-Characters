{"Henry-Fool": {"HENRY": {"raw_line": "Get up off your knees.Where you gotta go to get a six-pack of beer around here?Centuries ago it had an 'e' at the end.Nowhere in particular.I go where I will and I do what I must. That's why I'm in trouble. I'm sort've what you might call... 'in exile'.An honest man is always in trouble, Simon. Remember that.Well... I'll take your word for that.I see.Here. Take this. And......this. Keep them with you at all times. You ever feel like you got something to say and you can't get it out, stop and write it down. OK?This? This is my life's work. My memoirs. My 'Confession'.I've been bad. Repeatedly. But why brag? The details of my exploits are only a pretext for a far more expansive consideration of general truths. What is this? It's a philosophy. A poetics. A politics, if you will. A literature of protest. A novel of ideas. A pornographic magazine of truly comic-book proportions. It is, in the end, whatever the hell I want it to be. And when I'm through with it, it's gunna blow a hole this wide straight through the world's own idea of itself!Come on, let's go break their arms!Once. I forget where I was. Central America maybe. Somewhere hot. Stupid job. Bad pay. Dangerous location and water so foul the natives wouldn't even piss in it. This crowd of drunken motherfuckers hired by the local drug cartel shows up at my hotel room and threatens to tear me limb from limb. And I say, listen, hombres, OK, you've got me outnumbered four to one and you're gunna kill me here tonight and not a soul in this dimly lit world is ever gunna notice I'm gone. Fine. But one of you... one of you... one of you is gunna have his eye torn out. Period. Silence. I repeat myself. One of you poor, underpaid jerks is gunna have an eye ripped out of its socket. I promise. It's a small thing, perhaps, all things considered. But I will succeed. Because it's the only thing I have left to do in this world. So why don't you just take a good look at one another one last time and think it over for a few minutes more. They sober up a little, look at their shoes in confusion, then step out into the hall to talk among themselves.Well, here I am, still, after all.Good morning, Simon! Glorious day, huh? Here, have a donut. Can you lend me twenty dollars?Thanks. Where's the library in the scruffy little burgh?Excellent! I'm polishing up the final chapters of my 'Confession' and I need a reasonably well-stocked reference section.What's this?Can I take this?I'll correct the spelling.Simon! Who did this to you?Whose eyes?It won't happen again.This your husband?It's poetry.Of course I'm sure. I corrected the spelling myself.Yeah, well, you know -- that's what poetry does.We gotta talk.What the hell were you trying to do when you wrote this thing?Well, you know you wrote it in a kind of iambic pentameter.Verse.Look, in my opinion, this is pretty powerful stuff. Though your spelling is Neanderthal, and your reasoning a little naive, your instincts are profound. But the whole thing needs to be given a more cohesive shape. It can be expanded. Followed through. Unified. You see what I'm getting at?Are you willing to commit yourself to this? To really work on it? To give it its due? In the face of adversity and discouragement? To rise to the challenge you yourself have set?And don't gimme that wonderstruck 'I'm-only-a-humble-garbage-man' bullshit, either.Of course it does.Yeah. No. OK?Don't move! Fuck. There.Yes. Now shut up and lie back.Yes.You gunna be alright?Here. Bite on this.It's blood. From your head. Lie back. Shove that in your mouth and hold on to something.Okay. You ready?No.Yes, I do.How old are you?You look young.I don't know. Young.Thirty.There's no accounting for taste, is there, Mr Deng?See, Simon, there are three kinds of there. There's 'There'. T-H-E-R-E. There are the donuts. Then there's T- H-E-I-R; which is the possessive. It is their donut. Then, finally, there's 'they're'. T-H-E-Y-'-R-E. A contraction, meaning they are. They're the donut people. Get it?And look, if you're gunna read Wordsworth you've gotta get a more up-to-date edition. This odoriferous tome you're so attached to doesn't even have all fourteen books of the Prelude. And you need notes. Commentary. I'll go to the library and find you the best edition they have.Quit.Yeah.You need time to write, Simon. To study. To reflect.We all have to make sacrifices. A vocation like ours, Simon, is not a nine to five thing. You can't put a fence around a man's soul. We think and feel where and when we can think and feel. We are the servants of our muse and we toil where she commands.Yeah, and what's that mean?You ever think of leaving?Yeah.Out there. You know, into the world. Where ever.'Opportunity will step away and make room for a man to pass it by.'No. I found it in a fortune cookie.No. Not yet. Soon. We'll see.Well, you know, Simon, a piece of work like this, it's... A vocation like ours... You can't put a fence around a man's soul. What I'm trying to achieve, it's... Well, it takes a lifetime really. It's a life's work. But soon. Don't worry. I'd appreciate your feedback. I gotta go. See ya.Evening, Fay.I've got these books for Simon.What?Listen. I know a man. He's a big shot in the publishing business. Angus James. Smart, adventurous and tons of integrity. When this thing is ready, I'll recommend he reads it. He'll respect my opinion.What man?Why do they torment me like this? Why? They're like a bunch of fucking mosquitoes!They want to suffocate me, Simon! They wanna extinguish me like a flame!They're afraid, that's why! They're afraid of what I might do! What I might say! Think! They're afraid of my ideas!You and I are alike in this way, Simon.We're outsiders. We think and feel too much and too deeply. And the world can't handle that. Our mere existence is a threat to its illusion of security. Sure, they'll name a wing of a new library after us when we're dead! But now... Now, when we're alive... Now, they wanna burn us at the stake!Scram.For example, I made love to your mother about half an hour ago and now I'm beginning to think that maybe it wasn't such a good idea.I mean to say, I think Fay may be jealous.Bad move, Simon.A poet has got to be able to think about anything.Of course you are! A great poet! But you need experience. You need to do something to be ashamed of every once in a while, for cryin' out loud.Come on! Let's go out! There's a den of iniquity right across the street! You got any money?Simon. Hey, Simon. Come on. I got ya some coffee.It's a computer. You write on it.Here's the manual.I stole it. Now listen. Remember how yesterday we discussed the relative desirability of cadence in relation to the readability of...Simon, I can't work under these conditions.Get a life!I am not a rapist!Shit. Come on, this way.Keep a look out. Tell me when he's gone.He wants to help me! He wants to be my friend.Shhh!What's wrong?So, you're an honest man. Why beat yourself up about it?Your vocation makes a difference.Because vocation is the difference. Only someone who really cares doubts. Listen, father, as I was about to tell my friend Simon here, I am, without doubt, the biggest sinner within a hundred miles of this parish. But still, I've gotta stay up late at night to outdo the unending parade of mundane little atrocities I see committed every day right out in the open spaces of this loud and sunlit culture we call home.I like to think so. But the fact is I appreciate depravity. Nevertheless, I insist your vocation makes a difference, because to hold out anything other than a spiritual yardstick to reality is to be jerking off grandly into the abyss. Listen, have you got any money? Let's go have a drink.Worse than bad! Monstrous! But I love that about them. Wake up, Simon!Simon! What are you doing here?Simon...Simon...Simon, just shut the fuck up!Forgive me.Forgive me, Simon.OK. Look, do me a favor. You got a library card?Check this out for me.Milton. Seventeenth century. English. You see, Simon, it's important my 'Confession' dig up the past, comb previous evidence and help chart the historic -- even the aesthetic -- inevitability of my ideas. And...This place is crawling with chicks, Simon. Wander around. Leer a little. Cop a feel. Impose yourself on 'em. See what happens.Bullshit! You've got a rough hewn charm that sets 'em on edge. Now, listen, I gotta go.I got caught.Peachy. Gimme a light.What happened to this assistant librarian position you were supposed to set me up with?So what happened?Why not?So my word is not enough. My promise worthless. The fact I've served my time nothing but the emblem of my continuing guilt.I was caught. Yes, I was caught... once. I was caught in flagranti delicto screwing a thirteen-year-old girl named Susan. She was an ugly and mean-spirited kid, but she knew how to play upon my weaknesses which, I admit, are deep and many.You appear shocked.It was a pathetic little conspiracy. A transparently desperate attempt to discredit me and my ideas; to label me a mere pedophile. As if I'd be ashamed of such a thing. As if Socrates himself hadn't been taken out of circulation for corrupting the youth of Athens!Seven years. Seven years for one afternoon of blissful transgression. But what of it? Who cares? Prison's not so bad; particularly if one's a sex offender, free from the popular and conventional horror of sodomy.They were not 'lost years'.I put them to good use. I began my major work. My opus.Believe me, Simon, this incident with the girl, prison... It pales to insignificance in the wider context of my career.Nothing in comparison to the day my 'Confession' is unleashed. What an orgy we'll have then, huh? What shouts of outrage from the offended populace, from the sanctimonious purveyors of culture and quality, the righteous defenders of what ever inane and haphazard notion of progress then in vogue. They'll be beside themselves with fiercely reasoned critical analysis. Apoplectic with indignation!Their feelings will be hurt.Yes, like a mirror which reflects only the inside of the person before it, my 'Confession' will lovingly render humanity's common monstrosity in all of its lurid wide screen glory.Why should I blush or feel shame before the common lot of humanity, anyway, for a few banal and, again I admit, inelegant transgressions?After all, really, I'm doing civilization a favor.Soon.The greats all say the same thing: little. And what little there is to be said is immense. Or, in other words, follow your own genius to where it leads without regard for the apparent needs of the world at large, which, in fact, has no needs as such, but, rather, moments of exhaustion in which it is incapable of prejudice. We can only hope to collide with these moments of unselfconsciousness. This divine fatigue... this...As I tried to make plain in Paris: 'Nous savons que nous avons chut\u00e9 parce que nous savons qui nous sommes.' 'We know we have fallen because we know who we are.'That's beside the point. But did they listen to me? Of course not!For is this not the best of all possible worlds? Are not the evils of this world necessary components of a cosmos that could not exist without them?Unfortunately.At. One. Time.Go ahead. But never let yourself be flattered.Who?Because it's not done yet.The thing to do is to send parts of it to different magazines and literary journals first. That kinda thing. You know. Substantiate it.Filth, child. A preoccupation with excrement. Why?De gustibus non disputandum est.About taste. You can't argue about taste. God, Simon.What do you mean you don't know why you bother? You bother because you know the poem is excellent!Of course you do!Can you sit there, look me straight in the eye, and tell me you don't think this poem is great? That it is not at once a work of great lyrical beauty and ethical depth? That it is not a genuine, highly individual, and profound meditation on the miracle of existence?Can you?So, you see, you have no choice!That might not be as easy as it seems.Well, it's been a long time. My name might not carry as much weight as it once did with Angus.We were close at one time.Look, Simon, opinions come and go.To be honest; my ideas, my writing, they haven't always been received well or even calmly. They're upsetting. I'm a controversial man.You see, what I'm doing is too radical. Too uncompromising. It'll take time for people to see its value. It's ahead of its time, perhaps, or maybe just... A recommendation from me might do you as much harm as it does good.Because certain work needs to be experienced all at once in order for one to appreciate the full force of its character.In the infinite amplitude of his love, God wants to create the largest number of best elements that can exist together in one cosmos... OK.In an instantaneous calculation made in eternity, God computes the best possible world and creates it. Fine. This 'decision' by God is uncontingent and eternal rather than temporally or ontologically sequential.What?O-N-T... Don't you have some kinda spell-check on that thing?It is impossible for every perfect good to be compatible with every other perfect good. The intense beauty of the mountain must be set off by the fertility of the plain, so to speak.The good of freewill must entail real choices for sin.Listen, Amy, back off. I'm on parole.Hey! I don't look at you.I look at a lot of people that way.No, as a matter of fact, I think you're a real bright kid and I like that about you.I like it so much I've got half a mind to do perverse things to you. Right here. Right now. Things you might just learn to like.I'm just looking at the pictures.I learn so much from these magazines, Mr Deng. I refuse to discriminate between modes of knowing.Why not!This place is losing all its charm, Mr Deng.It's just a fad, Mr Deng. These kids today, they're just slaves to fashion.Come on, Mr Deng! How much do I owe you?That can't be right! And so what? My credit's good.Hey, Warren, you gotta couple of bucks I can borrow?Ah, yes, of course. When noble minds shrink from the task of leadership scoundrels will rush in to fill the void. Thanks.Yeah.Take a powder, cupcake.Evaporate!So I was a janitor! So what?Well, I mean, we weren't like bosom buddies or anything. But we used to talk sometimes. In the elevator. In the morning. He said he liked my ideas. Being a janitor's a good job if you're a writer. Especially the night shift; all that time to think and develop my ideas.Well, what the hell does he know? He wouldn't know a vital piece of literary art if it came up and bit him in the leg. To hell with him! He's not the only publisher in the world!It's true. A prophet is seldom heeded in his own land. Remember that.Hey, look, treasure!What is this?It's a ring. Jewelry.Hey, Warren, I found Pearl wandering around by the garbage dump.Who lost?Oh. Well, you know. Somebody's gotta lose.Vicky?What happened to you?I guess not.I found Pearl wandering around with no shoes on her feet.And you don't?Where's the beer?A double espresso and a jelly donut, Gnoc. You mind paying? My credit's no good here anymore, apparently.No, but it's OK. Simon's gunna try to get me a job on the garbage truck.Simon?Get outta here! When?It couldn't have been Simon.'Her figure makes me violent. I want to somehow break her. But tenderly. How is this possible? Ask Henry.'Bu\u00f1uel, this is obviously a love letter.Where did you get it?Oh, the slut!Is all this true about the Internet? About how you can get pornography on it?On the Internet?No kiddin'?Sure. See you. Gnoc, gimme one of these double espressos to go, will ya?Hello, Fay.You gotta get outta the house, Fay. You can't blame yourself for not being here. You did all you could for her.You got the Internet on that contraption?Look Fay, about, you know, between us -- what happened...Type a part of Simon's poem onto the Internet.Go ahead.Why not?Come on, Fay. It's a great idea.Sure he would. Just the first ten verses.He'll thank you for it later.Gimme another one of those tall double espressos, Mr Deng.I'm just looking.There's this fascinating story about a famous rock band and how they tied a friend of theirs to a bed in their hotel room and inserted a live fish into her vagina.They say she had numerous orgasms.I mean, it wasn't the entire fish, it was just, you know, the nose. The nose of the fish.You don't find that interesting?You ever wonder what it would be like to have sex with an animal, Mr Deng?I mean, some dogs are almost as big as people and often more attractive.Simon, I don't feel so good.I feel all kinda clammy. And damp.Seven.Can I use your toilet?How much you think I can get for this?I, Henry, take you, Fay to be my wife.And do promise before God and these witnesses...To be your loving and faithful husband.In plenty and in want.In joy and in sorrow.In sickness and in health.For as long as we both shall live.Oh, shit.I've let myself down, Simon! I've let myself be caught in the bloody maw of banal necessity! How did I get here? How did this happen to me? I'm going to be somebody's father! I need time to think. To write. Time to finish my 'Confession'! I can't work for a living! It's impossible! I tried once. My genius will be wasted trying to make ends meet!This is how great men topple, Simon. Their hearts are in the right place too much of the time! They get sidetracked! Distracted. Oh! How could I have been so careless!No. Not now. It's not done. I'm all washed up. I'm finished!Really? You really think so?You'd do that? You'd do that for me?Do you realize what you're saying?OK.Simon? You're here.It's a boy.She's alright.Thanks.How did it go?Ah. I see. Well, what now?Did he suggest changes?I mean, after all, there are things I can do to make it more accessible.I can soften up some of the language and make it read easier. Take out some of the more intratextual references and popularize the underlying Sturm und Drang, so to speak. I can change its mode. Make it more of a conventional novel instead.Oh, Simon, don't be such a purist! I appreciate your protectiveness, but the integrity of the work gives it a durability that can sustain such things.What are you saying; that it doesn't merit revision?Well, did you tell him what you think?Yes, it does. You've got to use your influence with him.You can refuse to let him publish your poem.You said you would.Oh.I... I don't know. Honesty, perhaps.I would have respected your opinion.Well, is there?Oh how perfectly enormous of you, Simon.Is that such a priority? Is that some sort of measure of a man's worth? To drag what's best in him out into the street so every average slob with some pretense to taste can poke it with a stick?You must be pretty impressed with yourself, huh? The all too obviously talented new man, the important new voice, the early clue to a new direction, or whatever, etc., etc., etc! A popular new trend conveniently packaged for the distracted young herd! You want to be liked more than you know, Simon Grim! You'd be nowhere without me and you know it.Yes. It's time you left.I saw you for what you were in the beginning, Simon. I hold no grudge and I'm certain you will, in time, leave some serious and small dent in this world.The world is full of shit. It's true. And you have to walk through it. That's your part. I'm sorry. But you're no good at it. Perhaps I'm not. Perhaps I wasn't made to walk through shit. Go on now. Leave. Do what you're good at. Go.Say hello to Patty, Ned.So what did you learn at school today, Ned? Anything?Here, I'll teach you something.Horrible, isn't it?See. That'll teach ya. Here, sip this.That's it. That's it. Perfect!What about him?God, they must be hard up for geniuses to pin medals on because, listen, I gotta tell you, when I first met this guy he didn't even know what an iambic pentameter was.Keep a lid on it, Bill, you're outta your league.He's a great American poet, you dumb fuck!Come over here and say that and I'll cripple ya in three different ways, you boozed-up Philistine!His throat hurt from smoking.Who's winning?What's going on in there?What did I tell you! It was just a fad. I told you that! I told everyone!Yeah yeah yeah. So what? A Nobel Prize. Anybody can get one of them these days. That's the problem, with this world, Mr Deng... Nobody's got any standards anymore. You seen Fay?I can't sleep in there with that racket!What are you doing here, Pearl?Some what?Shit!What?That was a long time ago.You oughta get outta here, Pearl.Go home.Fine.Why not?Warren beat up your mom?Is she alright?Does she need help?Vicky! Vicky, it's Henry from across the street! Vicky!Vicky?It's about Pearl.Look, Simon, the world's a scary place. I admit it. But it's not my fault. I swear!Don't be. You had things to do.Gotta light?Take care of your mom and don't start trouble you can't finish.I love you, Fay.Thanks.Yeah, well.

Please.Yeah.I make girls uncomfortable.Henry?What did you do?'Whereto with speedy words the arch- fiend replied Fallen Cherub, to be weak is miserable...'Why is it this beautiful girl makes me sad? Does she know how beautiful she is? Do people tell her? Does she ever feel stupid?Why don't I smile when she looks at me? I look away. Ashamed of myself.Her figure makes me violent. I want to somehow break her. But tenderly. How is this possible? Ask Henry.I can't breathe.Why do I do this to myself? And why do I reduce you to only one possibility? These are not even questions anymore. I know the answers myself. This isn't a page of notes. It's a letter. A letter to you. A desperate act. You are a miracle to me. I can't breathe.Nothing.Can you type my poem into that thing?Yeah.Sorry.When can I read it?Yes, but... do you think Henry is... dangerous?But what can I do?You alright, Fay?Angus James.I don't know.Dear Mr Grim, we here at the magazine consider ourselves and the publication open-minded and cutting edge and have consistently printed the work of the most brilliant and farseeing young talent of the day. Every week we are forced to return writing which we can not for one reason or another publish and include a brief but polite refusal. But this tract you've sent us demands a response as violent as the effect your words have had upon us. Drop dead. Keep your day job. Sincerely, The Editors.You can't argue with taste?The other twenty-five are almost as bad. I don't know why I bother.Do I?I'm not so sure sometimes.I, ah...No. I can't.Can you recommend it to your friend, the publisher?Henry? Can you recommend the poem to him?I mean, I think it's finished and, for better or worse, it is book length.Why?But he's your friend, right?You said he respected your opinion.Henry, why can't I read the 'Confession'?He's afraid that his reputation will prevent people from giving my work an honest chance.As a writer.He's kinda like in exile. Marginalized on account of his ideas.He has. He's written a book. It's almost completed. He's been working on it for years. It's just not published.It's a quite serious and difficult piece of work, apparently.No. Not yet. Soon. Certain work needs to be experienced all at once in order for one to appreciate the full force of its character.Please don't stop.That was nice what you were playing.Does that matter?No.I'm here to see Mr. Angus James.I'm not a plumber. Or a messenger. I was once a garbage man. But now I'm a poet.Why can't I see him now?Why?Because it's a masterpiece.Yes.I wouldn't want to waste your time.Thank you.Maybe.A friend of mine spoke of you. He said you had a lot of integrity.Henry Fool.But Angus James said he didn't even know you!Do it.Anyway, he hated my poem.But nobody likes it.Do it.Brass maybe. Some kinda copper.I think it's a gasket. A fitting from off of that old refrigerator over there.Did you see him?Did you talk?You've got to tell him, Fay.Henry?What's wrong?How many of these did you have?Henry, we have to talk.Fay's taking a shower.Henry, Fay's pregnant.Fay's pregnant with your child.Where did you get this?I know, it's just...Well, yes. But.Why have you reconsidered?But you don't like it?What made you change your mind?A hundred thousand in cash up front.A seventy/thirty split.So it's a good deal?So I should take it?Henry, please, let me read the 'Confession'.Angus James is convinced my poem is going to make him incredibly wealthy. He'll read your book and seriously consider publishing it. If I ask him to. I'm certain.I'll insist he publish the 'Confession'.Or I won't let him publish my poem.You saved my life.I owe you everything.It's terrible.Yes.Yes.Yes.That's what you said about my poem.But just exactly what is the nature of your faith in my writing?He taught me everything I know.How about if my advance is only a hundred thousand?We could split the royalties seventy/thirty.What happened?And Fay?Listen, Henry, Angus James didn't like your 'Confession'.What do you mean?No. He didn't.Accessible?No. Don't.No. Really, Henry. Don't.I'm saying... Angus James didn't like it.What I think doesn't matter.I gave it to him to read and he hated it. What more can I do?I can't do that.That was before I read your book.I signed the contract, Henry.Look, Henry, what did you expect?Look, if I had told you, when at first I read it, that I thought it was no good, what would you have done?And insisted that there's no accounting for taste.I don't know. I didn't bring it to Angus because I thought it was good. I brought it to Angus because you're my friend.Look, Henry, I did it! I wrote. I wrote poetry because you told me to! I worked! I worked while you sat back and comfortably dismissed the outside world as too shallow, stupid and mean to appreciate your ideas.Maybe. Maybe it is.I'm leaving.The world is full of shit.Get up off your knees.I'll see you in Stockholm.I'm sorry, Henry.So did you.Go on.Run.", "clean_line": "come trouble know retarded people mean think know quiet happened pills want tell quiet highway mile half left thought um wanted maybe gunna lose eye gunna lose eye promise set gunna eye torn head promise gunna tear eyes knew told like said told knew owww let iambic hurts breathe like wait sure right gunna hurt aaagghhh uh huh thank ok ll stop way work yes maybe today know tomorrow probably job like job clinically depressed guess means fault yeah guess book read confession finished writing poem man today looking know drove house times want yeah want think poet henry wait henry going guy want help difference friend quit job things want opportunity step way let man pass job treat mom like sick person gunna stay like know sick person retarded eyes keeping eye ve getting fucked otb winner town aggghhhh henry henry parole officer officer bu\u00f1uel came today told tell gunna jail gave number talking mr deng know thinking henry yeah girls uncomfortable henry whereto speedy words arch fiend replied fallen cherub weak miserable beautiful girl makes sad know beautiful people tell feel stupid smile looks look away ashamed figure makes violent want break tenderly possible ask henry breathe reduce possibility questions anymore know answers isn page notes letter letter desperate act miracle breathe type poem thing yeah sorry read yes think henry dangerous alright fay angus james know dear mr grim magazine consider publication open minded cutting edge consistently printed work brilliant farseeing young talent day week forced return writing reason publish include brief polite refusal tract ve sent demands response violent effect words drop dead day job sincerely editors argue taste bad know bother sure ah recommend friend publisher henry recommend poem mean think finished better worse book length friend right said respected opinion henry read confession afraid reputation prevent people giving work honest chance writer kinda like exile marginalized account ideas written book completed working years published difficult piece work apparently soon certain work needs experienced order appreciate force character stop nice playing matter mr angus james plumber messenger garbage man poet masterpiece yes wouldn want waste time thank maybe friend spoke said lot integrity henry fool angus james said know hated poem likes brass maybe kinda copper think gasket fitting old refrigerator talk ve got tell fay henry wrong henry talk fay taking shower henry fay pregnant fay pregnant child know yes reconsidered like change mind thousand cash seventy thirty split good deal henry let read confession angus james convinced poem going incredibly wealthy ll read book seriously consider publishing ask certain ll insist publish confession won let publish poem saved life owe terrible yes yes yes said poem exactly nature faith writing taught know advance thousand split royalties seventy thirty happened fay listen henry angus james like confession mean accessible henry saying angus james like think matter gave read hated read book signed contract henry look henry expect look told read thought good insisted accounting taste know bring angus thought good brought angus friend look henry wrote wrote poetry told worked worked sat comfortably dismissed outside world shallow stupid mean appreciate ideas maybe maybe leaving world shit knees ll stockholm sorry henry run"}}}
