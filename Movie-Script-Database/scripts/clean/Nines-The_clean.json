I don't have a belly button. I do not have a belly button where I should, on my belly. And I'm concerned, because I don't know if that's...Can a person live without a belly button? Because if you think about it, you're born with one. So if you don't have one, you're unborn and it's really hazy whether you're alive or not. I guess I'm wondering: am I alive? Or what if I'm God?No, no. I'm totally sober.No, I don't think I need an ambulance. I don't seem to be dying any faster than usual. But I should probably go to the hospital, don't you think? Yeah, I should.Gary.Are there reporters out front?What is?Hello? Yes. Yes.The weather in Toledo is rainy.Nine dogs ran through the field. The koala sits in the tree.What if I'm not here?I didn't mean to burn down my house.Actor?He has dogs?It's fine.Sure.I do.I don't do heroin.Good. I really wasn't concerned about my career, my family or my future. I just wanted to jack off.C'mon! All my numbers are in that.I guess.Once we get these samples back to the Crime Lab, we'll know who the real killer is.Is somebody there? Hello?Hello?! Yes. Yes.Nine leopards run through the jungle. I bought two cakes at the store.The house is haunted. There's a zeitgeist, or something.Sure. Maybe.Really?Parade? I fucking hate Parade.Okay.I'm not crazy.Not really.What did you do?That's awful.She's cute.She sounds really boring.You're rich. Shouldn't you have a nanny from Ecuador?Ohhh...Very Canadian.I'm pretty sure I'll be here.Is it?Gary.Okay.I thought I was.Ah! How boring of her.Demon liquor.So did I.... so it's kind of hard to prove that I only meant to burn my ex- girlfriend's stuff, and not the entire house.How about you? Any history of arson?I knew it! I could see that little spark.Oh shit.Just...Don't worry about it. Just...Goodnight.Hello.Yes. Yes. Two trains run through the forest.Jesus! You scared the shit out of...What?I don't speak that. Sorry. I don't...I'm fine. I'll be fine.Where are your parents?Your mom, your dad. Where are they?Look, you need to go back, okay? You shouldn't be out here. It's not safe.Shit.Evening, officers....the cops come and throw my ass in jail.Do I still have to answer the phone?I don't need a babysitter.So the guy was like, \"Do you know fencing?\" And I say, of course. That's what it says on my headshot.Always. So he says, \"Foil or epi?\"I say, I'm about equal in both.So he tosses me this fucking Conan sword and goes after me. I'm just swinging, trying to stay alive. But I end up cutting his ear.Just a little. But I got the job.Yes. No. Not the movie, the ride. I was like, \"Gar! Keep both hands inside the boat!\"Goodnight, you filthy whore.I know. Whenever I see them, and I always feel like, damn...Exactly.Groceries.How's Jaden?You've been watching.My affairs?I don't. Are you seriously jealous?From what?Yeah.What?It's not mine.I didn't write it.What?Seriously, what?Goodnight.Hi.Okay.How many times should the number nine come up? Probablistically?You know what I mean.How about every time?But they only show up when you look for them. Looking for them changes things.There is something wrong with the world.Peachy.Sure.What do I do?No.Tell me about the Nines.The Nines.Try. And don't tell me I'm imagining it. They're showing up everywhere, and I want to know why.I'm a Nine?Why don't you drink coffee? You're always drinking tea.Talking.I never met you before I came here.No. I'm a lot confused.This is all a dream.I'm in a coma.Then I'm dead. This is Hell, or Purgatorium or something.What does that mean?What happens if I cross this line?Oh shit.No. I'm a lot confused.This is all a dream.I'm in a coma.Then I'm dead.

You say you understand but you don't. You can't. You're like a big giant Vulcan.He's coming. I'll call you later.Hi. Margaret. I work for Lola.I know. We need to go out the back.A few. Not Hugh Grant level. More like Robert Downey, Jr. when he broke into that family's house and slept in the kid's bed like Goldilocks. \"This bed is just right.\" I handled episodes two through four for Robert. This sort of thing is my specialty.Famous fuck-ups. Don't worry. Mama's gonna take good care of you.It's computer voice recognition. The system can call you any time day or night. If you don't answer within five rings, the police come and haul your ass off.That's why it's called house arrest. You stay inside your house. He can take direction, I promise.Okay, just so it's said, this house is flammable.Yeah, I didn't mean to eat my way into a ten-year shame spiral, but I did, and it's healthier to acknowledge it. This flammable house belongs to one of Lola's other fabulous clients, who is currently shooting a pilot in Toronto.Writer. So for the next six weeks, su casa es su casa. I say, feel free to wear his clothes. He'll probably get a sick thrill of out it. The gays.They're away at summer camp. Now, try the bed.Comfortable?Look, Gary, I know this has been crazy and stressful. I want you to feel safe. And comfortable.I'm a fan of yours, you know. Your number-one fan.But if you fuck this up, I will smash your ankles with a sledge hammer.That wouldn't be comfortable for either of us.I'll be coming by twice a day to check up on you. I'm the only person who should be coming by. No buddies, no pals, no heroin dealers...Yeah, crack is classy. And I'm not buying you porn. There's spray-per- view on cable.Let me see your phone.Dial ten digits at random. Whoever answers will be better than the people on this phone.You have my cell number. You have delivery menus. You're fine. Right?Poltergeist, and no. Maybe they were rats. L.A. is teaming with rats. They live in the palm trees.Okay. You know I'm a licensed psychotherapist.No. I'm a publicist. My job is what other people think of you, not what you think of yourself. So pull your shit together. I am thisclose to getting Christine Walsh to do your piece in Parade.Everyone hates Parade. But the people who watch \"Crime Lab,\" they love their Marilyn Vos Savant. Give them a woman of indeterminate age who solves riddles and they are in hee-haw heaven.One heartfelt act of contrition and maybe the showrunner won't kill off your character between seasons.I swear to God, if you go batshit on me...Exactly. Exactly.Once again, the idea of house arrest is you stay inside your house.Think of it like an electronic leash. Basically, if you ever go more than 100 feet from the base station......the cops come, they throw your ass in jail. If you ever try to take it off, the cops come and throw your ass in jail. And if they ever detect drugs or alcohol in your system...No. I kick your ass. Then the cops come and throw your ass in jail.No, I'll be doing that from now on.

I like peaches.You want coffee?You okay?Oh.The Nines?Sort of hard to start there...Best guess? They're your subconscious trying to remind you who you are.Yes. It doesn't make a lot of sense of out context. Coffee?Happy?You're not going to understand this yet, but we've known each other for like 25 years. One day when I was 12, you called me out of the blue. And we've been talking ever since.On the phone. Usually.You, Gary, never met me. But you're not always... I can understand why you're a little confused.Theories?No.No.Okay, a purgatorium is where Romans vomited. But no. This is as real as anything can be.Everything is what it is. But you're not who you think you are.God, no! Please, Gary, don't.You don't know what you're doing.I don't know. But it's not good.I can understand why you're a little confused.Theories?No.No.Okay, a purgatorium is where Romans vomited. But no. This is as real as anything can be.Everything is what it is. But you're not who you think you are.You're a multi-dimensional being of vast, almost infinite power. You created this world on a whim, and decided to stick around to see how it turned out. You, this body you're in, is just one of your incarnations. Avatars. Call you what you will.Technically, no. If God is a ten -- a theoretical ultimate, that-which- no-greater-can-be-imagined -- you're more of a nine.Humans are sevens. Monkeys are sixes.Koalas. They're telepathic. Plus, they control the weather.What's important is that you, you're the big cheese. El Supremo. You could destroy the world with a single thought. Don't, incidentally. Just file that away. But the truth is, you hold all the cards: every church, every candle, every sacrifice -- that's for you. When people pray, they're not praying because they want this thing or that thing. They just don't want to be forgotten.So you understand, I would have told you earlier, but I didn't...Okay.You could destroy the world with a single thought. Don't, incidentally. Just file that away.

She starts to believe that her daughter is the key to a dark conspiracy.Basically, it's like \"Rosemary's Toddler.\"We sold it in the room.Just tell me Roger liked the script.Melissa McCarthy is my first and only choice for the lead.The only way we can afford to shoot the pilot is in Canada.It's really hard to think about leaving for six weeks.Action!Puggies!It's weird being back. It doesn't feel like my house anymore.At this stage, you have the script you wrote, and the film you shot, but you don't know how it's all going to come together. You just know how you want it to feel.I invited Susan to see a rough cut because I trust her taste.Wow. I thought it was pretty obvious. And dramatic.So we're trying to squeeze in a wild line over this shot of Noelle.How could you...Yeah.I know. It's just for the test screening.The dumb people might not.That's how I like ya.That guy's looking at me.The guy was crazy. Obviously. The show is kinda twisted, and it just flipped something in him.Oblivio accebit. It's Latin. \"Oblivion approaches.\"Other than the world is coming to an end? \"Oblivio\" also means forgetting, forgetfulness. I think that's what I'm going to do. Forget it.From the screening?The Nines.Absolutely.She doesn't have a ton to do in the pilot. There's so much to set up, you don't get a lot of Melissa- time.But the network still likes the show?How about above Roger?After he consults with the Higher Powers.Do they like the show?Why are you focusing on Melissa?She's also the biggest star in the show.Well, hooray for Roger. I don't understand what you want me to do.Who?Yes. And you put her in Gatin's pilot.Replace Melissa and reshoot the pilot.So is this even about Melissa?I see why the network loves her. It's just, I wrote the part for Melissa. She's one of my best friends. And in my head, I only see Melissa for the role. Could Dahlia do it? Absolutely. It could work. I just don't know if I want it to work.When I get stressed out, I play videogames. It's my therapy. I can't have them on my own computer, because then I'd never write. So I come down to Koreatown.Videogames are better than real life. When you get stuck, you can always hit `reset.' Life needs a reset button.If we're really going to replace Melissa, I want to hear it from Roger.What does that mean?Yes, replace Melissa?What about Melissa?God no. I'll tell her.I think my house is haunted.1926. Ever since I got back, I feel like there's someone else there. And then last night, I thought I heard something. A woman singing.I guess. And then I saw something. I ran into someone.It was a man. I think it was me.Yeah.No. No.The network wants to replace you.And I'm letting them, because I really want the show on the air. I have all these characters inside my head, and they want to live. I'm the only way they can. This is the only way they can. I have five seasons mapped out, and though it sucks, either you go away, or the show goes. I had to make a decision, and that's the decision I made. I'm sorry.Yes.I don't want to do this on camera.Reality.The reality is, you would not be here without me. I gave you your first few roles.

I don't sleep.Did something happen?So I just bumped into Dahlia Salem, star of my show...... who tells me Gatin's show got picked up, so no, she won't be in my show, which makes me wonder, does my show even exist?No, I've left word with Roger. I've left word with Susan. It's like they've dropped off the face of the Earth.I heard your show was gone.The network wanted Dahlia.Really.Susan Howard.I will break your fucking finger.Bullshit.The rest is, what, reality?You can go to Hell.Didn't you?All I want to know is why.Yes.My show did. So tell me why.Melissa.I didn't.Fuck you.Look, I don't want to do this anymore. My show's not going to happen, so this show is over.Done. Gone.
