Pause.You're talking about kids.Okay.I love kids. He looks down, resumes eating. A beat.Of course I do. She looks at him.Eddie Vibes.I'm okay. What's going on?Yeah.Yeah. Eddie stares at him. Smiles.What do I say what?It's November.Oh. Beat.So where's this game?Huh.Bank robbery. MAX pulls up his pants, flushes the TOILET.But I didn't do it. Max smiles. Goes to the sink. Washes his hands.Henry.So...what are you in for?Nothing.I'm not sure.My what?Not sure I ever had one.I don't know. A pretty good one?I told you. I'm here by mistake. Max shoots a look back at him.What? Several convicts are making their way towards them... He pulls Henry close, his tone suddenly intense :I am.What tests?I don't feel good.Hi. You look beautiful.I'm okay. How about you?Okay.Oh. Pause.Okay. Wow...It's alright.No. He looks at her.I want you to be happy.Books and covers.Hector. You're up. Standing just outside, A GUARD watches the make-shift barbershop carefully. Hector takes his seat. Max wraps a sheet around his neck.Next month.Nope.I didn't do the crime.Yeah, you're right. Henry ponders.You know you never did tell me what your dream was, Max.Really?This place is horrible, Max. Max thinks, lathering his hair...When?I thought maybe this was my way out.Yeah.Yeah. Henry, silent for a moment.Maybe you should think about getting out of here sometime. I'll buy you a cup of coffee on the outside.I thought it was my dream is my truth is my destiny.I'm going to miss you.I'm still gonna miss you.Hey.Thanks.Sure.Hi. It's not so awkward.Thanks. A beat. They just stand there for a moment.Are you happy?I'm glad. He means it. Henry picks up the box, shoulders the bag.I don't know yet. Joe enters.You mean like a pyramid scheme?Yeah?I don't know your name.Right. You're welcome Joe.I'm good. How are you?Greece?I was in prison.Good. Thank you.About what?Sure. Sounds good.Thanks. She sits down at her desk.It does?Good.I think I'm okay. He grabs his thigh. Winces with pain. Tries to get up.No, don't. I think I'm okay.Yeah. Fine.Yeah.Thanks. Julie comes in.It's okay. I really am fine.No. You look familiar.What?Oh, that's why. An awkward moment.Yeah. I'm okay.Yeah.Sure.Thanks.A bathroom?Hobbles down the hallway. He notices the photos on the wall. A series of HISTORICAL SHOTS of OLD BUFFALO.Nice to see you too. He goes to hug him.I figured it out.My destiny.The bank.Yeah.The one I didn't rob. Pause.Exactly.I did the time, I may as well have done the crime.I need your help.So what do you say?You've got your review coming up --So you can get of here. If you want to.Yes, it is.Yes. It is.This is not a home. This is a prison.Max. You can't die in this place.You really want to die here?I'm asking for your help.I've thought about it. It's the right thing.Max! Max exits.Watches as Julie comes up the aisle. She notices him.No.I saw your picture outside. The door was open. I came in. She exits.Is it always like that?(gesturing back to theYeah.Looks complicated.I thought you were listening. She looks at him, curiously.I'm Henry by the way.Sure.Doesn't look like you.Oh. It's funny.Yeah. She smiles. Pierre puts the coffees down on the bar.Oh.Yeah. I guess. Pause.Why?You're leaving? She downs the last of her coffee.Appears. Smiling.I knew you could do it. Max looks around nervously.I don't have a car.Yes, it is. I'm here. I'm picking you up.Max, it's okay. You're free.Come on, Max.Take it easy. There's nothing to be frightened of. I promise. You're okay. The bus station's just a short walk. Max starts to hyperventilate :You're going to be alright.Come on, Max, we're going to miss that bus. Henry helps Max back up again.You hungry? He opens his bag and pulls out a sandwich. Offers it to him. Max doesn't say anything.It's pastrami. On rye. A beat. Max opens one eye...Here we are. Henry indicates the tiny bed in the corner of the living room. There are some second hand books on the bedside table like `Future Shock' by Alvin Toffler and Dostoyevsky.That one's yours.Anything else you need? A beat.I'm not sure, Max. But it seems to give people a lot of purpose. They walk into the Cafe Orpheum.It's a start.It's an article.No. No guns.Someone could get hurt. Pause.Maybe it's still there, Max. A beat.Maybe it is. Max looks at him.The vault is here. He walks across the alley...The tunnel runs under here... He follows it toward the back door of the theatre.And ends up somewhere in there. He turns to Max.Hi.Julie, Max. Max, Julie.Oh, we were, you know --How you doing?Sure. Go ahead. Julie and Henry watch them go.No. He's a friend.It's peaceful out here. Beat.Is it fun?Pretending to be other people. She thinks.So, in a way, you're still playing `you'.So what part of `you' are you playing now?My story?I'm figuring that out.I just got out of jail. ON JULIE. She wasn't expecting that.Sounds worse than it is.No. Do I look like one? She studies him.What do I look like? She studies him some more.I do? She laughs. Then stops. Dead serious :The Cherry Orchard. So what happens? What's it about? Is it funny? Julie gets up out of her chair.I guess it's not funny. She looks at him.Do you like Chinese?Golden Dragon?Eight o'clock?See you, Julie.You found it?Who?What about the vault?Okay. How do I look?Hi. How was rehearsal? She puts it down. No answer.Where then?I guess that's where people go.Sounds like a plan. The waitress brings over the check and the fortune cookies.We going anywhere in particular?I get it. They start to walk...I worked at a toll booth.Rainbow bridge.Yes.Yeah. She laughs.What's so funny?That's funny?I worked nights. It gave me time to think.About where I wasn't going.I'm working on it.For trying to rob the First Buffalo Bank.I thought I was on my way to a softball game. It was a mistake. Pause.But now I'm going to rob it for real.Yeah.There's a tunnel.Runs from the bank to the theatre.Yeah.What?What for?Neither can I. She gets up.`I have to go to Kharkov on the five o'clock train. Such a bother, I wanted to stay and look at you and talk to you.`Even more beautiful, and dressed like a Parisian...you could blow me down.'`Your brother says I'm an upstart, a money-grubber.'`I don't care a bit. I just want you to believe in me like the old days!'`I just want your wonderful tender eyes to look at me like they did then.'`I just want your wonderful tender eyes to look at me like they did then.' She laughs some more. Comes closer.Me too. They kiss...Good morning. She climbs on top of him. Henry smiles.Good morning.Max.It's alright. She knows.We brought breakfast. How do you like your eggs? Henry enters the kitchen...leaving Max and Julie there.Yeah. I did.It's okay, Max.How do you like your bacon?No. I like it out here.`Your brother Leonid says I'm an upstart, a money grubber...`I just want you to believe in me like the old days.'We read it last night.We were.Yeah. She downs her coffee. Stands.What?We could?It's rehearsal. There are people everywhere.What?What?What?I'm not an actor.Max. Come on.No, it doesn't.I can't be Lophakin. They have a Lophakin. Max thinks...There has to be another way. Max, frustrated :Yes. I want it.Then you're gonna be Lophakin!I read it. I think I know the scene.Your brother, Leonid ANDREYEVICH says I'm an upstart, a money grubber --A money-grubber!Your brother, Leonid Andreyevich says I'm an upstart, a money grubber. He can say whatever he likes. I don't care a bit --I just want you to believe in me like in the old days.Good God in Heaven. My father was one of your father's serfs, and your grandfather's serf before that. But you, you did so much for me in the old days that I've forgotten all that... His yearning is suddenly palpable. Intense. Tender.I love you...like a sister...more than a sister. Henry drops to his knees, supplicates.Good?I think so. A beat.You mean since you ran me over... She smiles.No.I used to sit in that toll booth and think about just getting in one of those cars, going wherever they went. Just joining someone else's life.Yeah, I was.That I was going along with everything. I didn't know I could change it.It already has. She gets the honey out of the cupboard. Pours some in her tea.Nice. A beat.Are you sure you're okay with this? I know it's a lot. She turns to him.Thanks. Thank you. Looking forward.There's still twenty feet to go. He turns back to him :We're going to need another pair of hands.That's him.Thanks for meeting us.How's your pyramid scheme?Okay. Joe hits his Schooner Longneck.Kitchenware.So how's Debbie?She's pregnant?Congratulations.Come on. This is great news. It's going to be okay.Listen, Joe, maybe we can help. A beat.We might have a job for you. Max shoots a look at Henry. Joe chugs a glass of water, looking at both of them now.There's maybe twenty feet till the bottom of that vault.So what do you think?No guns. People could get hurt.They're still guns.I like it. She looks at him.For what?I hope not.Not really, no. He thinks carefully before he says it :I don't know. Maybe I could meet you out west...Yeah. Maybe you could meet me there.Just now.Meeting me --You're not?I thought that was your plan. Do the playIs there a reason you didn't leave before?Yeah. Well. Maybe...It was just an idea. Why not --I didn't.Why couldn't I have met her after?Julie. I asked her to meet me. After we're done.She said no.Why of course?I paid already, Max.I'll check. Henry walks to the door.Who is it?Yeah. I know you.What do you want, Eddie?You can't kill him.What happened last night?We should talk about it. She turns.What's on your mind, Frank?What was her name?I'm Sorry. The moment just hangs there...Shit. ON THE MARQUEE : \"Chekhov's `The Cherry Orchard'...Opens NOVEMBER 23rd, 8 PM\"Opening night.That's soon.Maybe we should wait. Do it closing night.Walks back outside again. It's as if he got all the answers he needed...No. He turns to Max.I'm not leaving her.Not a cloud in the sky.You too, Max. Let's go.I want you to meet me in California.We're doing it tonight. She sits there...It's the only time we can get in theNothing's fucked up. If it's tonight or a month from now, what's the difference? I still want you to meet me.Arnold's coming back. Max arranged it already.I want us to be together. She laughs. That's so ridiculous to her.You know that's not true --Isn't she beautiful?What are you doing, Eddie? Eddie turns at him.I got shot. Henry hears the tannoy. It's his cue. He's late.I gotta get on stage. He rushes out...It's fine. Go. Joe guns it.Stop the car!Joe, stop the car.It's never been about money. You know that.Take a chance. Meet me in Moscow.That's not true. Meet me in Moscow. She tries to get away again...I can't. Pause.Meet me in Moscow. She can't move. The audience is rapt.I know.`Your brother says I'm an upstart, a money grubber...but I don't care a bit.'

She's tending to him, caring for him... Debbie looks up. Sees Henry staring at her.Henry?Appreciate you driving, man.Near Kaisertown. Like fifteen minutes.Pull up right over here.

Take the money out back to my car. Joe doesn't move. Eddie waves the gun.Joe! Max boldly steps right in front of the gun.Don't be stupid, Max.I'm not playing with you, old man.Welcome to the party, Brando. Seeing the gun, Henry freezes at the door. Eddie's in the middle, Max and Joe by the mouth of the tunnel, Max on the floor, a gash on his forehead from Eddie's blow.It's money, Henry. Money.Shut up, Joe. Get the money. Put it in the car. Shut up. He turns back to Henry.Now move, Torne. No happy ending for you. He gestures to the tunnel. Joe suddenly turns back, grabs Eddie's gun hand from behind. THE GUN GOES OFF. They wrestle.

The future of food storage. Plus, if you recruit distributors, you get paid even more. Passing through the living room arriving GUESTS notice Henry walking out carrying his box.No! God, no. It's a multi-layered marketing paradigm.Henry.Listen, I just wanted to thank you. For not giving up my name. A beat.Sure you do. It's Joe. A beat.Sure. Joe is looking worse for wear.It wasn't a pyramid scheme.It all fell apart.See what happens when a person tries to go `legit'?She's worried, Henry. The baby's due in a couple months. He grabs a wing. Rips off the meat.Yeah, she's pregnant.Thanks, Henry.Really? It is? You know how much diapers cost? You know how much it costs to send a kid to college?Of course not. I'm just saying.

And a little sheepish. Now we see why : EDDIE VIBES is standing right beside him. He walks right on in.Sorry, Henry.I screwed up. Sorry, Max. Joe lies down on the floor. He's drunk as a skunk.Yeah. You can't kill him, Max. He's got the vault --Deb says we can't have sex till the kid's born. Says the kid'll know about it.What do you think guys? If it's a boy do I cut him or not?What do you say, Henry? Before he can answer :This sounds like a set-up, man -- Frank grabs Joe. Glares into his eyes.Who?Hey! I think I got something... Joe furiously digs his shovel into the caked-in dirt above his head. Suddenly the ceiling of dirt comes free burying Joe who struggles to get out. Above, from where the dirt once was, is the smooth surface of concrete. The bottom of the vault.Sorry.There she is.

What're you in for?I said what are you in for? A beat.Good. Clean. Simple. I like it. Henry just watches.Ah. Mistaken identity. A perennial favorite. Identities are just constructs, anyway. They're mistaken all the time. He dries his hands. Presents one of them to Henry.I'm Max.Go on. Make yourself at home. Henry sits down on his bed.Life. A beat. It's starting to hit Henry...Don't worry, you'll get used to it.Hurry up. We gotta go. Henry's disoriented.Breakfast. A GUARD, seeing Henry still in his bunk, bangs his baton against the bars of the cell.`Monday is whole wheat bun-day.' Henry's lost in thought...What are you thinking about?You're thinking something. Let me guess. You're thinking, `How did I get here?' Henry puts out his tray.How do you think any of us got here?I'll tell you how. Because we committed crimes. But we committed to the wrong thing. You see that was our mistake. We didn't fulfill our potential, we got angry and we took it out on other people. A bald, TATTOOED GANG-BANGER walks right past them to a table.See him?Hector. He wanted to be a doctor. He could've been, but he chose not to fulfil his potential, he chose not to commit to his dream. And now look at him.By the way, I recommend the potatoes.That's the real crime, Henry. Not committing to your dream. They begin to eat.So what's yours?Your dream.Never had a dream? What kind of a life is that?Henry, you're in jail. Henry thinks about that. Puts a piece of potato in his mouth.But here's the good news. We got all this time to do. And time is a medium of exchange. You can buy things with it.Knowledge. Self respect. Forgiveness. And in your case, you can figure out what your dream is. Max takes his arm :Your dream is your truth is your destiny. Henry looks at him.There are no mistakes. Max suddenly glimpses some activity over Henry's shoulder.But you're going to have to fight for that dream, Henry.You're at a crossroads now. There are going to be tests!This is your moment. Whatever you do now defines you. Go get em! Henry gets up : CHARGES the inmates, arms swinging, taking several down. He gives it everything he's got. They pile into him, pummeling him. Henry just keeps fighting...but it's hopeless. GUARDS rush in. Max watches.You did good, Henry.You're doing better than you feel. Henry touches his swollen eye. It stings.Go to sleep, Henry.I ever tell you I was married? Henry turns to him.I mean nearly. I had a lovely correspondence going with Jocelyn Steinberg in Utica. Problem was when she finally came on visitor's day she said I was too short. Henry thinks.Right. Books and covers.Clean as a whistle.Thank you.October.I'm working. The other INMATES egg him on.Leave me alone.All right, so I'm sitting there, and the head of the board asks me what I'm going to do if they let me out this time. And, so... Max's face starts to shudder...his shoulders jerking back a little bit...I get this twitch! and then I give him my answer: \"I'm gonna break in your house, set your dog on fire, eat all your food, go on a naked rampage through your garden, dance in the streets of your l'il hometown like a crazed harpee, hurl myself headlong flaming through the ethereal sky like God's blackest angel and explode like a goddamn heavenly fireball! Eyes ablaze and face beetroot red and twitching like a mad man...Oh, yeah. You don't want ME. You don't want THIS. Not out THERE. The inmates look slightly scared. Max casually picks up his clippers and smiles :Believe me, I'm not going anywhere. They crack up. A beat.Everyone knows Henry's innocent. Laughter.I like it! `You got the time, so you may as well have done the crime!' Everyone laughs again.Now that's funny, Henry.I'm living it.Sure! It's easier to live in here. You don't have to do anything. You just show up. In fact they even do that for you. I'm living the life.So why didn't you just say something?Back then. When you had the chance. When you were still innocent.And was it?See. There are no mistakes.You got everything, kid?The only thing I've ever missed in twenty three years is a hot bath. And that ain't worth walking out of here for. The cell door slides open.Don't forget. Your dream is your myth is your truth. Pause.Just testing. Henry continues...stops at the door.Yeah, well. I hope I never see you again. Henry smiles.Get out of here, Henry.Emerges with a guard.I thought I told you I didn't want to see your face again. Henry smiles.What?Good. What is it? A beat. Henry leans in.The bank is your destiny?What bank?But you went to jail for it.What are you talking about Henry? Henry looks around. Closer --Ah, that. Time. Crime. Right.What for?I'm in Jail. That's what I say.-- So?No. It's not as simple as that.No, it's not.No, it's not.I'm happy here. This is my home.Whatever you want to call it, I'm happy here. A beat. Henry looks at Max now. He looks frail.I can die wherever I want.What do you want, Henry?To rob that bank?!Henry. I got cards.Great to see you, kid.Right.I always do, Felipe! As Max reaches the end of the walkway, an OLD GUARD opens the next steel door for him.How's your grandson?That's great. The socialization begins! The Guard smiles as he leads him toward the PAROLE BOARD ROOM at the end of another long corridor. They stop at the door.As many as it takes. The Guard shakes his head, opens the door for him.Well...Where's the car?You don't have a car? What's wrong with you? You came to pick me up without a car. That's not picking a person up.I don't know about this. Maybe this is a mistake. Max turns....walks back towards the gates. Starts to POUND on them.Dave! Carl!Open up! DAVE! No response. Henry approaches. Takes Max's bag.I don't like this.I can't breathe. I -- can't breathe... Henry hesitates a moment, puts an arm around him...I'm going to die right here. I told you!Thanks.Yeah.Ah. The land of milk and honey. Pours it into his bath.What is this obsession with coffee, Henry? When did that happen?Oh my God. Are you kidding? This was eighty years ago. It's ridiculous. Oh my God. That tunnel's probably not even there anymore! Are you dreaming, Henry?A start? This was your plan? An old cartoon in a pissoir?Whatever, Henry. Why don't we just go in with guns and do it the old-fashioned way?What?That's sweet, kid.Right. Okay. Yes. First things first. Why don't we go take a look at this bank of yours?Money is a mistress with a hard heart.I'd like to speak to your manager please. I'm interested in opening an account.What kind do you have?He was never wrong. How long's it been there already Mr. Tuttle?And in the very same spot, correct?Thank you. You've been very helpful.It's virtually robbing itself! Henry laughs. THE DOOR HITS the back of his head as it SWINGS open.Hiya.I was just showing Henry the place I used to perform. Henry shoots Max a look.Chekov's tough stuff. It takes a steel stomach.Of course. Apart from Gorbachev he's my favorite Russian. She laughs. Max approaches her.Would you mind if we took a look around? It's been over thirty years since I've been inside. She considers the request.Thank you. As Henry passes :Home again.Oh. Shakespeare, Ibsen, Mahoney, the greats.Would it be a tremendous imposition to have a little tour for old time's sake?That okay, Henry?Ah, the inner sanctum. The magic before the magic! I remember it like it was yesterday. They enter the Green Room where ARNOLD is holding court.Simon, did you know there used to be a speakeasy down here during prohibition days?I know.I know!Booze, broads and lucre. The good old days. I like it.All good things must come to... ...an end. Max stops. Turns to Simon, and with a broad smile :Do you need volunteers?That was great! This place is full of treasures. Max comes right up to them.Thank you, Julie. And thank you, Simon. I'll see you tomorrow.Henry, let's get out of these people's way! Henry turns to Julie.Let's go.You were right, Henry. You got a nose like a bloodhound!Yeah. Right there. In Lophakin's dressing room.Lophakin. We find a way to get into his dressing room and we're right as rain! Henry and Max notice FRANK standing at the corner of the alley having a cigarette. He glares at them as they pass...I can see it, Henry. It's all in front of me. The vault. The bank. The tunnel. The pieces of the puzzle are on the table. All we got to do is put them in the right order!First things first. I'm on the dirt.Like Henry.(he starts to take off hisHenry!I figured it out! Once we're in that dressing room the dirt from the tunnel goes out through the roof!(rushing out into the frontAh. Company.She does?Hold on. Max follows Henry into the kitchen.You told her?It's a crime. You're supposed to keep crimes a secret.No. It's not kosher. Pause.Okay. I'll get dressed.I'm a confidence man.I never liked that word. It's only half of what it is. The word confidence comes from the latin. Fides. With Faith. Belief.Yes. He glances at Henry.But I was always much better at the feeling good part than the ripping off part.Not really. For me it's a win-win situation.I like jail. Three hots and a cot. Julie looks at Henry now...What is that?Chekhov?!I thought you were on a date.Reading Chekhov's a date? Beat.Can you give me a ride there?I'm a volunteer! She regards him a moment.No.This is driving me crazy.We could be digging right now!If we were in that dressing room.This is pissing me off. Max leaves....after a moment he stops where he is...freezes... ...then turns back to Henry...I got an idea.You have to be Lophakin!If you did we'd be able to get into that tunnel whenever we want.You're not a bank robber either! And you're doing that.She said you were a natural. That means you can do it.Yes, it does Henry.Your dream is your truth is your destiny! Henry thinks...What if they didn't?Kid, You forced me out of jail to help you. And I'm going to goddamn help you. But you got to help me help you. Now I need to know... ...do you want this bank or not? On Henry...What's happening?Oh. Gosh.You said he was a natural.Henry.Henry would be perfect for it.For Lophakin. It takes a moment till her mind gets a hold of the idea.Yes. She laughs.Exactly. He'd be playing himself. Think about it Julie! He is Lophakin.A man who came from nothing. A man who's not afraid to create a new life and put his past behind him. A man who's in love with you...Madame Ranevsky. A beat. She does think about it.Fact is you need a Lophakin and Lophakin needs a dressing room.Nothing. She regards him. Suspiciously.Sometimes a good guy needs a less good guy to help the good guy be good. He smiles. A beat : She SLAPS him hard across the cheek.Fair enough. They just sit there for a moment...He just needs a shot. One audition. Let the chips fall where they may.They'll get someone else. She thinks...Give him a shot. One shot. That's all I'm asking, Julie. She thinks some more...Tracks! Trolley tracks! The beam scours the blackness ahead looking for the end....and there it is. A soot-covered WALL maybe ten feet ahead. They reach it. Henry touches the damp, decrepit brick, turns to Max.That's him? Henry and Max watch as JOE grabs his head, flops into a chair. Max looks concerned.What's he talking about?Oh.You want to send your baby to college? Joe keeps going on the wings. He's making a meal of it...Listen Joseph, guns are dangerous and we're not doing a simple hold-up. Tellers and tears and chump change. We're doing an old fashioned heist. We're going right into the belly of the beast.It's going to be incredible. I'm talking, Florida...Palm trees. Sandy beaches. All you can eat sunshine. Grapefruits as big as your head! Henry sits across from him.Who?Oh yeah? What'd she say?Of course she said no.Because life ain't like that. There's always a cost. That's why they call it life. You got to pay somewhere. The piper must be paid to pipe.Who's that?Who is this guy? Eddie beams at Max.What do you mean?Joe doesn't know what he's talking about. He's a drunk. He made a mistake. Get out of that chair. Eddie laughs. Leans back on it.I'm gonna kill him. With a knife.Shut up, Joe.Go home. Please. Before it's too late.Three feet of it so far today. We'll make it. Henry goes to the open doors of the Armoire. The tunnel is deeper now and all lit up...Well, you know what they say, cleanliness is next to Godliness.In on what? Frank snickers.Hypothetically say you were right about what we're up to...which you're not. But just say...why would you help us rob your bank?Well, forgive us, Frank. But we're going to need to hear them. A beat.And?We're going to have pull some nights. Henry thinks...We can't. He's retiring. This is a one time deal.You're going to have to leave her.There he is!You okay, Henry?The girl -- He throws down his shovel.Now listen, Henry. You're digging this tunnel. And you're gonna rob that bank. You're gonna take the money and you're gonna put it in the car and we're gonna drive away.We have arrived! Look at that. Joe gets to his feet - he looks dazed.So clear you can see tomorrow.Enjoy the show, folks! He checks his watch...it's two minutes to eight. He walks briskly up the aisle...Shit.Oh god, oh god. Where are you, you little pischer? He finally finds the right one and CUTS IT :Julie -- Break a leg!Good-bye, Julie.Go! Go! Go!Do your job. Joe leans over and pukes on the ground.That was good, kid. Good acting.That's everything.What's that, Eddie?Stay right where you are, Joe. Eddie puts the gun to Max's stomach.You're not going to do this, Eddie. Eddie smiles.You can shoot me dead if you want, but you're going to have to shoot me dead. Eddie PUNCHES Max in the gut, then pops him in the head as he throws him back.This was your chance you idiot. You could've been a better man but you did it again. You messed up. And now you're back with the maggots. Just one big missed opportunity. Eddie kicks him again.Famach deh mohl! Gey lig mitt'n vahntzin son of a bitch! Henry, a little dazed, picks up the gun.Our new partner. Huh. Max stuffs a glove into Eddie's mouth but Eddie still kicks like crazy. Max notices Henry's thigh.You ok? Henry sees it now too. It's a graze.Old man, huh. Eddie tries to scream but he can't. As Max shuts the door all light is blotted out.Any minute now.How's the leg?Henry!He can't stop the car, it's the getaway!What the hell are you doing? Henry starts to run back toward the theatre as best he can... Max sticks his head out the window.Henry! But he's already gone...Time is a medium of exchange. You can buy things with it. Education. Self-respect. You can even figure out your dream. The Guy nods. Max turns. We see him now. He's super tan. He pulls the sheet off his client.You're done. Next! Another YOUNG CUSTOMER sits down. There's a few of them waiting their turn, enjoying Max's schtick. The front desk girl hands Max the mail. CLOSE ON A POSTCARD : `Our dream is our truth is our destiny...Love H... xx' Max smiles. Flips over the postcard and only now when he pins it above the mirror do we finally see what it is -- an image of THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN.So tell me, Javier.

"What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Are you okay? Stan. I gotta call you back! I just ran someone over. No, he looks okay.You idiot, you weren't even looking where you were going! Are you okay? Henry's a little delirious.No. Stay on the ground. The bank Guard FRANK rushes over.Is he alright?He just walked right out into the street. He came out of nowhere.Yes. I was. I know how to drive. Cars are honking now as Henry limps his way over to the sidewalk.What are you doing? Get back on the ground!Did you call an ambulance? I'm calling an ambulance.I think we should call a doctor. Henry just stares at her. For a long moment.What? Are you okay? He keeps staring...Hello, guy? Are you okay? Do you need a doctor? A beat.What? It takes Julie a moment.Oh. That.Well, I guess you seem to be okay.Okay. So you're okay?Great.Bye.Is it really me sitting here? I want to dance and clap my hands!The girl who hit him with her car. She's in mid-speech :I think I must be dreaming. God Knows I love my country. I love it deeply. I couldn't see out the train window I was crying so much.I'm...listening.An action. I'm listening. Is this what you mean, Darek? Is this what you want?Then what do you want? They stare each other down.Fine. I'll go drink coffee. Julie marches off stage...What are you doing here? She doesn't wait, just walks right past... Henry follows.Are you here to sue me?Then what are you doing here?What?You mean rehearsal?It's a process.It's all pain.Julie.Coffee, Pierre. She points at Henry.You want one?Two. They stand right there at the bar. Silence. Henry notices the play poster on the wall over her shoulder. Looks at it. Then back at her. Comparing her photo to the live person.What? She turns to see what he's looking at. A beat.So what do you think?No, I meant the poster.Actors on a tree is funny?That's the director's joke. She starts dropping cubes of sugar in her cup.He's making a comment on the American culture. Actors faces as falling fruit. Birth, death, the consumption of the ID. Henry's interested.To him, the American dream has become the world's nightmare. \"You are the country of apocalypse.\"The irony is, he loves the American dream. I mean that's why he's here, right?But the truth is I wasn't listening. I was playing it safe.You know the Cherry Orchard was Chekhov's last play. He was dying when he wrote it. She thinks. He listens.It's perfect.Right after we're done.Jesus...goddamn! Goddamn Czech Chekhov shit!Jesus. Henry? She looks at Max.What are you doing here?Oh. What? The door opens. SIMON, the Stage Manager, pokes his head out.Thank God.You know Chekhov?Sure. She gestures them inside.Sure. Yeah. Come on in.Great. I'm in hell.So what productions were you in?Fuck him.He used to perform here.Is that your dad?He seems like your dad. Henry walks out onto the stage where Max was standing, getting the feel of it.What?It's not really like that. I don't pretend to be someone else. I find some part of me, and reveal it in a new way...just inside of a character.Yes. Exactly. In a way.That's the question you always have to ask yourself.So what's your story, Henry?I mean, like...what do you do? Henry crosses the stage, goes to sit in the chair opposite her.Does that mean you don't have a job? A beat.Jail!Really? Jail sounds bad.Are you a murderer or something?No.I don't know. A criminal. He laughs.Yeah.A woman returns to her family estate in the Russian countryside and realizes she has no choice but to sell her beloved Cherry Orchard, the magical place of her youth, the only place she ever felt safe.It's about being forced to let go of the past and create a new life in order to survive. Max's voice booms :Tomorrow?Oh.Why?Yeah.It's okay.Sure. They look at each other as ACTORS return to the stage. DAREK moves towards his place in the front seats.Stay out of jail. Henry waves.Sorry I'm late. I'm starving. She sits. Looks at the menu. A GUY who's leaving, sees her :Bruce. The guy glances at Henry. Leaves.That guy's a total dick. Hi, Henry. She studies the menu.I feel like duck.I don't just want to be good, I want to be great. And I don't just want to be great in Buffalo.Don't laugh.I don't want my legacy to be a Buffalotto commercial. And it's not going to be. Soon as this thing is done I'm out of here.I hate fortune cookies.Want some? Henry shakes his head no. She turns the radio up.You know there's a whole bunch of bodies down there churning around. Just caught in the current.All those dreams churning around down there. It makes you sick.So what did you do before jail, Henry?Which one?No!I had family that used to live on the other side. I took that bridge all the time. We must of met a hundred times! He nods. She's probably right.Wow. So you were one of the guys in the tollbooth with those weird rubber gloves?You were watching everyone go somewhere and you were going nowhere.Yeah. Funny sad, not funny funny.About what?See, that's funny.What'd they send you to jail for Henry?What!Sounds like it. He looks at her. Decides :You're going to rob the bank you already went to jail for robbing?Ha!What tunnel?My theatre?Ha! She looks out the falls.You're fucking hilarious, Henry.You know what?I'm hungry.Ice cream.I can't believe I'm sitting here.I want to dance and clap my hands. She moves through into the lounge. Henry follows.I think I must be dreaming! She starts moving around the room, dancing to the music.God knows I love my country. I love it deeply. She sits down.I couldn't see out the train window I was crying so much. Henry's not sure what she's talking about. She gestures to her copy of `THE CHERRY ORCHARD' on the coffee table.Page twenty one. Henry opens it.I couldn't see out the train window I was crying so much. But I must drink my coffee.Read the next line!Say it like you feel it. Like it's real. Say it to me. Henry takes a beat. This time he makes it his.You're good. Keep reading! And get up. Walk around!Yes, you are. You're a bank robber, Henry! He laughs.Don't stop --Again! Henry's getting into it.I'm glad I ran you over. Henry puts the book down.Good morning, Max.I didn't know the dirt from the tunnel goes out through the roof. She laughs a little. Max looks at Henry like `what the fuck?'It's okay. I'm not going to tell anyone.So what were you in prison for, Max? Max slurps his coffee.You mean a `con' man?You mean you make people feel good...and then you rip them off?Aren't you guys worried about getting caught?How?You too, Henry? You like jail?So why would you take the risk? Is it the money? Henry doesn't answer, starts to collect the plates.It must be the money. Henry smiles.You are a criminal. A greedy little criminal.You remember!It's Chekhov!I got to get to the theatre --Why?You weren't in any of those plays, were you?All white! All White! Oh, my Cherry Orchard. After the dark, stormy autumn and the winter frosts you are young again and full of happiness; the heavenly angels have never abandoned you...Oh, if only I could be free of the stone that weighs me down! If only I could forget my past!Look! It's mamma walking in the orchard...in a white dress! There she is.Arnold's leaving the production.Perfect. Beat.Yes, Stan, yes! I know it's bullshit but that's what's happening...What? He gestures, `Can I come in?'. Max gets in.Sorry, I can't give you a ride --Stan. Let me call you back. What?Henry what?Perfect for what?You mean Henry should play Lophakin?He's not even an actor!Why do I feel like the earth is suddenly shifting under my feet?What's going on here, Max? What are you doing?You made this happen, didn't you?What am I supposed to do now?What if it doesn't work?Okay, confidence man.Show me, tell me. Darek laughs, circling... Henry takes her hand now...his voice drops...Does this make me an accessory?Things have certainly gotten a lot more interesting since you showed up.So why are you robbing the bank, Henry? He doesn't answer.It's not just about the money, is it?So why are you doing it? It takes a moment for him to answer.You were asleep at the wheel. Henry smiles.Which was?Robbing the bank is changing it?What was your wife like?Not for a girl like me, Henry.I hate that commercial.So what's your plan?For when it's done. After. Am I going to see your picture in the post office or something?But have you thought about what happens after?Out west?What about what?-- I'm not going anywhere, Henry --No.Plans change, Henry. Okay? She gets out of bed. Throws on her robe.I think I ran out of maple syrup.Because life is fucked. It never works out the way you want it to. Silence...Right! On the lam? You're dreaming.This isn't going to work out, Henry. She turns to face him.Didn't we both know that? On Henry.I did. Silence.I think you should leave. Henry just stands there...stunned.I came to my senses.I don't want to, Henry.Come in. Henry appears. She's surprised.Henry, we've been over this --What?Of course! Opening night. What else? Like I said, everything always fucks up --Nothing's fucked up? Have you looked around recently? You're leaving. What about the goddamn play?I'm sure he did. He approaches her...We screwed a couple of times, Henry! So what?No, really. A couple of times.You're a thief. Go rob your bank. A beat. He leaves.Play's already started, Max. She walks past him.Good-bye confidence man.One last look at these walls, these windows...Dear mother used to love to walk about in this room.We're coming. The sound of the HOODED FIGURES as they chop the trees behind her. It's horrific. Madame Ranevsky holds her hands over her ears and falls to the ground...and begins to weep...Henry.
