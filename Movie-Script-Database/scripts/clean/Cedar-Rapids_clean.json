Not to my knowledge.So. Does your tummy feel good enough to...?I can try and... hold it, Mil. Can you...?I'm bringing it. Bringing it! Bringing it! D'aaaarrgho'awesome...Ooh, you make me live! You're my best friend!Sorry. But you are, babygirl. You're my best friend.Ya mon, Bahama-mama.Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait... Where's this coming from? We agreed on Wisconsin Dells for the honeymoon. It's what we agreed on.So? Roger and Gwen Lemke go to the Dells every year...Hello, Tommy Bartlett's Ski, Sky and Stage Show? It's not just a water park...What's so great about...? You're not... You're missing the... We agreed on the Dells.I'm living a perfectly fine life. I don't know why you'd want to... Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09rock the waters or whatever. Ridiculous.We agreed on the Dells.Hello... Oh, hey Bill...Aw jeez. Oh my gosh. No...I'm... Gwen, I'm so sorry. Roger is-- was-- is-- a personal hero to me. He just... he had it all. If there's...I'm...Hang on guys, how's this sound-- you can both be right. I know you're probably thinking, \"Oh, an umbrella policy's only for rich people.\" You know what I say to that? Bull roar.Pam, Kurt-- I've known you guys since you were little kids. So let's don't think of me as an \"insurance salesman.\" Think of me as your friend who just wants to help you protect your dreams...I'm... Excuse me a sec...D'you-- can I get you a napkin or something, Bill? For that?Um. I'm with Kurt and Pam Gambsky...Wait, Roger was going to buy Northlands?Holy cow. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09The... belt and the lederhosen...?Is there...? Can I do anything to help, or...?\"Innovations in Hog Farm Risk Mitigation.\" Roger's Two Diamond presentation for the ASMI Convention. I helped prepare it.Mm.Whoa-whoa-wait. What are you saying?I can't go to ASMI. To Iowa. To Cedar Rapids, Iowa... Why can't Lila do it?Bill, I've never... I mean, I've dabbled in hog farm risk mitigation, but I'm no pro...Millie and I are getting married.Hey. Wade. Hey. Is Millie...?It's six AM...?Oh yeah. Those guys. Hilarious. Ha.Well I just wanted to...Oh shoot. You already have a Strut the Rooster...It's only four days. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09We agreed on the Dells... Should we maybe talk in the...?If I don't try to do this, it's not just my job, Mil. There are four other employees whose lives are on the line. Plus Carol, who does part time seasonal work. So.No, Bill said he'd make that part of any deal...It's... Oh, who am I kidding, I'm a little scared here. A lot scared. But not about us. What we've got-- we're like lightning in a bottle, babygirl. I love you so much, Mil.I know. I will. I mean, Cedar Rapids-- there were only four homicides last year. For a city of 122-thousand that's pretty darn good. The forcible rape numbers are admittedly a bit higher, but...I will every day. Twice a day.OK, three times! Sheesh. And I'll send a stinkin' telegram, too.Thanks! Just wanna be sure I make my flight. Going down to Cedar Rapids. The big ASMI Convention?Cold enough for you? I'm heading to Cedar Rapids. Supposed to be up in the mid-30s down there. S-weet!Whoa... what's all this now?Hey Bill, what's going on?Dean Ziegler, Stevens Point.Affirmative.On me at all times. Plus three back- up discs.Bill... I have to ask. Let's say one of these big dogs-- your Allstates, your Prudentials-- does decide to go and buy Northlands...?You're talking what, water landing? Terror type deal? Terrorists...?Believe it or not, I have actually never been on an airplane before.OK. If you need any help, I'm in.Tim Lippe.Great to meet you, Dave. Wondering, what kind of name is Marinakis?Marinakis. OK. Mine's German. Lippe. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09As in, \"Don't you get lippy with me, mister.\" My grandma used to say that. Before she passed. Lot of people pronounce it lip. Course the high German's probably more like lipp-uh.Like I say, Dave, it's not life insurance so much as it is dream insurance.I think so.Let me know how things go with your Alltel deal, Dave. E-mail me.Hello. Score!Holy crap. Awesome.What's that now?Oh, I'm like, \"this gal wants to borrow my heater?\" Tss. But no, sorry, can't help you there.You bet. Tim Lippe. Northlands Insurance. How `bout yourself?Well Bree, it's nice to meet you. But let me give you a trade secret. Keep smoking and your premiums will go through the roof.You bet. Party hearty. Nice chatting with you, Bree.You tell me. Never done the hotel deal before.Trent, I was given the impression that you honored traveler's checks.Traveler's check is a fully insured method of, y'know. 100 percent.I'm a non-drinker.Not yet, but I can smell it. The chlorine. It's a super top-notch place, Mil. You'd be blown away. Oop, 321. I'm at mi casa. Just a... lemme see how this deal works.Key's like a stinkin' credit card.Oh jeez. I'm sorry. I'm... Please. There's an Afro-American gentleman in this room.Let me call you back, Mil.Um. Yeah. Yes. You bet. For a minute there I was like, whoa, I'm gonna be robbed here, or...It's super... just super great to meet you, Ronald.Check out these digs. Huzzah!No. I'm down. Down with that. Heck yeah. Any idea who we're gonna be chilling with, roommate-wise?Can you imagine? Or someone who has terrible gas?! Like, pull my finger. Brrump! Hello, no thanks!Ha. N-T-S. That's hilarious. I'd love to own my own agency...No. I do not. I'm down from Brown Valley, Wisconsin. Northlands Insurance.Uh, thanks. Thank you. It's... Roger was just a super great man.I'm planning to watch President Helgesson's opening remarks. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09I'm worried about this Deanzie guy. Bill Krogstad told me specifically to stay the heck away from him.Did he say over 15 agencies?You're competing? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09I need to talk to you, Mil. I'm in over my head here. I feel like I can't even swim. It was fun at first, but now it's like, I dunno. I need you so bad, babygirl...Who's...? Wade?Are...? You're at Millie's still?Um. Yes, please. And just, would you tell her I love her very much.I... Ma'am, no. I'm sorry if you... I wouldn't... I have a fianc\u00e9!No, no, no, please. I didn't...Ha. OK. That was different. Ha. Yes. Yes you are. A real... jerkhead.Tim Lippe.No I don't. I'm actually in town for the ASMI convention.No, it's an association of insur... Oh. You're screwing with me again.Um. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09Oh. I... OK. I... I really enjoyed your speech, President Helgesson.You bet. Very much, sir.Tim Lippe. Down from Brown Valley, Wisconsin. Northlands Insurance?Um, well, it's rough. Real rough. Like you said in your remarks, Roger wasn't just a great rep, he was a good father and...Yeah. It's just rough.Thank you.Yeah, it sounds pretty top-notch.What?!Thank you President Helgesson.Hello Dean.Ah. Do you guys have root beer?Ah, why would I need a nipple...?I didn't... Nobody. President Helgesson gave them to me.I really don't... Orin, President Helgesson, he wanted to help me meet people. Just being friendly.Ah, that would be nothing...No. No it is not. Millie and I are engaged. To be married.Exactly. And P-S, I would never, ever have \"relations\" or whatever with another woman.Hey. Ha. From the fitness center.Oh, I don't, ah...Ah... Grenadine? Please.It's been a super long day. I, ah, better... Good night...Hello Bree.We? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09Wade.Oh. Tell him hey.I have to do some work before bed, so...No, it's-- I love you so bad, babygirl. It's so hard here. I just miss you.Tss. Yeah, yeah. Keep reminding me.OK. You, too. I love you. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09Current risk mitigation mechanisms available to hog farm operations include futures and options to...I'm in here!What the heck is going on here?Are you drunk?We're not close...No I'm not.I know. I heard.Pardon my French, Dean, but that's a bunch of bull roar. My boss, Bill Krogstad? He told me how you called up Joyce Armbr\u00fcster and smeared Roger's name all over town...So wait, you didn't call her? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09So what's with this petition?What? That's impossible.Hmm...? Oh. Yeah.Hello, thank you. I feel like my head is gonna like... Y'know?Excuse me, Ronald. It's my boss. This is Tim. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09I... No...Bill, I... That Dean Ziegler-- he was trying to warn me about Orin.Bill, I'm sorry...I didn't know I did anything wrong.Mm, I don't know. Only everything.He didn't have to yell at me. I didn't do anything wrong. I'm trying my hardest.Could you?You are freaky. No, it's kind of weird how I got interested in insurance, actually. When I was six, my dad got killed in a sawmill accident.Yeah. Not good. But after he died, our insurance agent fought like a tiger against the sawmill to make sure me and my mom were taken care of. And we were. The crazy thing-- our agent was actually Bill Krogstad.He had just opened Northlands. Anyway, I remember thinking, this guy's a hero. A real hero. So even if he doesn't always treat me, like y'know... whatever now-- I'll never forget that.This river-- the Cedar River? It flooded the whole city a couple years ago.People talk about the firemen and policemen and that. But think about all the claims in a disaster like that-- how hard those agents worked to make sure people's lives weren't left in the lurch. We're talking billions of dollars in damages, literally. And claim by claim, dream by dream, those agents helped rebuild this city. I'm telling you, it's a noble calling. I really believe that.Tss. I wish. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09Well, even if you're being full of it, thanks for saying that anyway.We didn't spoon, Orin...You need to leave me alone.Hello.Millie? Something happened...?What the H did I ever do to you, you a-hole.I just wanted to hear your voice.Nothing. Nothing really...Oh.I'd like to sign up for the scavenger hunt.Eastern Iowa's largest two-story mall. I know. Sweet. And yes, I do have a teammate.Oh, nothing. Say Joan, you have something on your blouse.Burn.Thank you. Thank you very much. So, ah, I signed you up for the Scavenger Hunt. To be my teammate. In the Scavenger Hunt.Uh, well I... Because Ronald already had a teammate...... And I thought you'd-- we'd-- be y'know, a decent team. So... I think you should do it.I am super pumped!You're going down, a-hole.Check it out-- Planet X!I compiled a ton of info on Cedar Rapids. I've got a sweet laminator in my basement.... Maps, area attractions, crime stats, local customs...Bingo! Right here-- Planet X Family Fun Center. Let's go. Act natural.OK, I think we're going to want to take Blair's Ferry Road to Avenue C, then probably east on 100.I memorized the major thoroughfares and landmarks in the metro area.\"You've seen the future, now Czech out Cedar Rapid's past.\" But it's Czech, like Czechoslovakia. C'mon!No, you're doing great, Joan. And you look super awesome with a wiener in your mouth. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09No. Maybe.No, it's actually a big thing in Iowa. ABC news did a story about it. I saw it on YouTube.Uh-uh, absolutely not. I'm scared crapless of heights.Yeah. Let's do this thing.Hang on... How's it...?Ugh. This is frickin' hard.Wait, we won?Oh crap. I forgot... Hey, Millie.I'm sorry, Mil. I signed up for this scavenger hunt, and check it out-- we won! My teammate and I, that is. Joan.That was Joan saying hi. Millie says hi.OK. Sounds good. Sorry Mil, go ahead.Just some gal from Omaha they paired me up with. Between you and me, she's a little different. Real hyper-- one of these types who kind of overdoes it. But for a 75 dollar gift card, I'm not going to complain. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09OK, Mom...Mil, I didn't...Hey. What say we just use the gift certificate to get a nice supper here? At the mall. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09We have a gift card. But I didn't make a reservation. Is that OK?Nice. Thanks.To victory. To new friends. To life. And all the joys of living it.Mm, it does taste a lot like communion wine. Awesome. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09Mine? Let's see. Um. I would love-- some day-- to put a little greenhouse in my backyard.No, I've actually seen some fairly decent portable ones at Fleet Farm that won't break the bank...Well. I always hoped I could take over Northlands when Bill retired. But that obviously isn't going to happen now.Yeah right.I don't... Probably not.Grrrr. Ha. Time out. Sheesh. Let's. OK. What I'd really like is a family. To be a dad. So kids, I guess, that's what I really want.You've got kids?Awesome. Beautiful kids. And that's...?Norway.Wow.OK. I thought of another one.Wish. Or dream or whatever. It's still small potatoes compared to...... to all you've done-- Norway and all that, but... Do you watch American Idol ever?No-no-no. Negative! Sheesh. But I do enjoy watching it quite a bit. Randy's always like, \"That's awesome, dawg!\" And Simon's such a-- \"Oh, I'm so superior.\" Anyhow I was thinking of maybe trying-- trying-- to get a solo in my choir. At church. I mean, it's all super political. But I'm a fair to middlin' baritone, so... Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09Oh no, I have to practice my Two Diamond presentation. I can't...Ha. Nightcap. Kneecap, more like...Yes.Actually, do they have cream sherry?She is MARRIED. And you're just... What is wrong with you?Well. Yeah. You kind of are. But I guess I've seen worse.Ronald! Hello. Thanks mucho... So Ronald, what's your situation? You married, or...?Wow.I never use my vacation time.Dick head. Yeah Dean, you are a total Richard!No, if you used some salad dressing a bum's a-hole might not taste that bad. Thousand Island!Did he just...?No, no, no, no, no...I, um, I've met some really, just super neat people here. But this song, I'd like to dedicate to the first African-American person I've ever met. I mean, I've seen guys at the Oneida Mall in Rhinelander-- said hello and that. But... Anyway, I just think you're one of the most awesome guys around. Ronald Wilkes!I was born and raised down in Alabama. On a farm way back up in the woods. I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches. Papa used to tease me about it. But deep down inside he was hurt, 'cause he'd done all he could.My papa was a great old man. I can see him with a shovel in his hands. See education he never had; He did wonders when the times got bad. The little money from the crops he raised barely paid the bills we made.Uh-oh. Who is it then?I know. I just...No frickin' way!Ich can nicht schwimmen. That's \"I can't swim.\" In German. And I can't. `Sides, I didn't bring a bathing suit.Yow. Chilly. Ha.Yep. Ha. Fun. Fun day.Oh jeez. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09You have tan. A tan. Tan line. You have a.You. Are. You're. Married.I have a fian...Oh jeez...Holy crap! We're so dead!I want to make love!Your body's just so... firm and pretty. Mmm. Making love to you was just super... super awesome.Wanna cuddle?I love to cuddle. You're special, Joan. So special...Good morning. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09No problemo.Is that...? Were you looking at my Two Diamond presentation?Um. Thanks. It was Roger Lemke's...What? Whaddaya...? You and... You and Roger, you mean?My foot I knew! No, I did not. And yes, it most certainly does matter. Man, this T's me off. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09Every stinkin' place I go people remind me: You're no Roger Lemke. You're not as good as Roger Lemke. Here we go again.Why were you with him then?Hey, hey. Come on. You're pretty and smart and just super awesome. I like you.Grrr. I'm so frickin' confused. Last thing I thought was that I'd come to Cedar Rapids and fall in love.Us. This.What about...?Where the heck are my clothes?Yeah. Well, you're acting like a fricking... prostitute.I lost my slacks somewhere.I'm really, really sorry Ronald. If I said anything, or...No, I'm not. I...Goddarnit!No it's not. Nothing is OK. My job, my fianc\u00e9... God, I'm a philanderer. I've let Bill down. I've let everybody down.Is this...? Why is this all of a sudden about you, Dean?President Helgesson, please let me stay in the Two Diamond contest. Please. This isn't for me-- it's for Bill Krogstad. I can't let him down. Please just let me compete.Ah, no. Thanks.This is the petition?Oh my gosh, really? Thank you.PayPal? Um, yeah. I've used it to pay for Beanie Babies on E-Bay... For my fianc\u00e9.I don't understand what you mean...You bet.I can't say that I do...You're an awesome President...I'm still not reading you here...Do you literally mean you just need help, like, getting on-line, or...?You're talking about stealing.I'd be doing it for Northlands-- to keep it in Brown Valley and help my co-workers. To help Bill...What would you need me to do exactly...?Um. I... I don't know about that.I'm sorry about... Ronald. Just... about everything...A large cream sherry, please.That's pretty hilarious.Another please. I have to use the little boy's room.Bree? It's Tim Lippe. From the ASMI convention. We met out in front of the Holidome across the street?That's what you get from smoking all those-- what'd you call `em, heaters? Smoker's cough. Ha. Just kidding. Butterscotch?Small world, huh?Ooh, that's really awesome of you to ask. But I have a super important presentation in the morning unfortunately, so...Yeah. I hear that. L & C. Loud and... clear.I have had a pretty messed up day actually. Might not hurt to forget about it for a little while. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09That must be pretty all right, Ken, getting half off at Applebee's all the time. I'd only weigh like 10- thousand pounds...Ah...? This would be marijuana, I'm guessing?Oh jeez, oh jeez, oh jeez.I FEEL AMAZING! THIS IS AWESOME!AH, CASH-WISE? ABOUT 90 DOLLARS, I THINK. I'VE GOT A TON OF TRAVELER'S CHECKS, THOUGH. WHY?DO WHAT NOW?My mom became real protective of me after my dad passed. She didn't really let me play sports or any of that. Fact, if I think about it, I never really did much of anything. Except gardening, which I do enjoy.Thanks. It's funny, though, because my job is all about protecting other people's dreams. But what about my dreams?It's fully insured. 100 percent. And we didn't make love...I don't know. I don't know. All I know is I was getting kicked and then Ronald was there talking like a ghetto person...I can't believe Bill would do this to me. He was like a father...I love you, Joan.I didn't make love to Bree, Joan.Sweet love showin' us a heavenly light. I never seen such a beautiful sight! See love glowin' on us every night, I know forever we'll be doin' it right!I always wanna call you \"friend!\" Sweet love showin' us a heavenly...Careful. It's super slippery.Whoop. Careful now. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09I did a ton of research on hog farm risk mitigation. Don't worry-- they might bite you a little if they think you're a food source. But there's never been a recorded hog- bite death. So...The Two Diamonds may be meaningless to you and Bill. But there are people who care about this stuff. Ronald Wilkes. Even Dean. Honest, good people. I'll come back for you after the Two Diamonds have been handed out to a legitimate winner. I'm really sorry about this, Orin, but the insurance industry deserves better than you.Kurt Gambsky, Tim Lippe-- your insurance agent. How's Pam and the girls? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09Well, I think everything's OK. Hope it is anyway. Listen Kurt, here's why I'm calling...Thank you. I'm Tim Lippe. Hog farm risk mitigation... What is...?Smooth move, Ex-Lax. So, Hog... No. I, ah... this girl I met, sorry woman, I guess. She's 23. She takes drugs, and I think might be some kind of prostitute. But she's super insightful. Y'know what she said to me last night? Said the only real insurance is love. That's fricking INTENSE, isn't it...?I'm... ah... Our only true safety net. Love. Crazy. I believe in insurance. I believe in love...Bill! Bill Krogstad. My former boss, everybody. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09Why'd you do this, Bill? I don't understand.Why'd you do it, Bill? Why'd you do it? Why'd you lie, Bill?Insurance isn't just a business, Bill. Insurance is personal. I've got some savings. I could've gotten a loan. We could've worked something out.Screw you, Bill. Screw you... hard. That's a bunch of dog crap. You and Lemke, that... fucking pervert... you stole my ideas and called them your own for years. And I didn't say squat-- because I figured we were like a family. I may not have quite as many clients as Roger had. But my people are loyal, Bill. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09I care about them. And guess what, they care about me. Fact, I've called more than half of them already this morning...I knew which ones would be on their way to church, which ones I'd be waking up, which ones probably got a little blotto last night and might be hung over... And every single person I talked to-- every one-- is staying with me.I do actually. I do know, Bill. And before the day is out, I'll have called all my clients. All of them. So hey, congratulations Pyle of Shit-- you just bought a company that's losing half its business.Here.You'll figure it out.I know what you're thinking-- thinking \"this wiseacre's full of baloney.\" Am I right?But I'm telling you Reginald, you're actually a perfect candidate for term life...I'm serious. Call any time-- on the mobile or home phone, though. The office number's no good anymore.Don't even say it, Deanzie-- no one butt rammed me or whatever in there.Not particularly.Did you?Sweet.Well.Tss. Ruined it more like.I'm gonna miss you guys.I think it sounds awesome.You bet. You bet. You too.Yeah. Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. I used to watch that. Would be cool some day to see.So.So, did you do anything fun in Cedar Rapids...?How's the walleye?Meatloaf's on the dry side.What's...?How ya doin' there, Leslie?No, you probably won't.I'm trying...The chances we take in life are called risks.We pay insurance companies premiums as a way of hedging our bets, in case those risks we take cause us or our property harm.That's the point of insurance-- so we can live and love life to the fullest.At Tim Lippe Insurance, we can't guarantee that you'll live your life without devastating losses. But we can give you peace of mind-- knowing that if something awful or unfortunate does happen-- we'll have you covered. Tim Lippe Insurance. Insuring your Home and your Hopes.

No fucking way! The Ronimal! Gimme some love-uh, my soul broth-uh!What's the matter, friend, never seen a chocolate-vanilla love sandwich?! Wait until later when we get to the buttfucking! Nah, I'm having fun. Dean Ziegler. Stevens Point, Wisconsin.Don't worry, I won't bite. I'm medicated. Not really. But I should be. Right Ronimal? So what's your handle pal? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09Call me Deanzie. Where you hail from, Tim Lippe? Quiet-land?Bill Krogstad's outfit. The Krogger! Aw shit. I was sorry as hell to hear about Lemke's passing up there. That guy was tits as a rep. Course he thought I was a big, loud asshole-- s'pose he wasn't too far off there. No boy, a real tragedy.Amen. He'll be in my prayers. His family, too. Tragedy.Well. I don't know about you wingnuts, but the Deanzie could use a drinkzie. What say we blow off the welcome hoo-ha and hit Horizons for happy hour. Two-for-one cocktails, 10 cent wings, and an all-you-care-to-eat pussy buffet!Oh, don't get me started on that smug fuck. Orin Helgesson is a-- pardon my French-- a cunt. Just a steaming wet dog cunt.Fine. Have fun ladies... Not.Party time. Excellent.Timbo! Over here roomie!How's she hanging Big Tim? Big time Big Tim...It's Deanzie, c'mon. Ahoy Cap'n, we got a thirsty sailor over here! Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09Kid was in the navy. Seaman.You want a nipple with that?Ach, I'm busting your balls. You don't get out much, do you buddy? Whoa, who'd you have to blow to get all those?Smug fuck. Trying to poison my roommate with his B-S propaganda.Wow-wow-wow, you are na\u00efve. A rail cocktail's, what, four bucks? Times that by 10 drink coupons. We're talking 40 large, Tim. Doesn't sound so friendly anymore, does it? Sounds more like one of these I-scratch- your-back-you-scratch-mine deals. I bet ol' Orin invited you up to the Tiffany Suite, too, hmm? Fourth floor? View of the pool? Yup. Cocksucker's buying your vote, pal. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09Ronimal! Taco Bill! Over here! Bill Hernandez. I call him Taco Bill. Mexican.So Big Time Tim, what're you looking for pussy-wise here in Cedar CRAPids?That your mom?My moral compass is pointing true north, if you read me. Right Taco Bill?And by the way, Ronimal-- I was married. Was.Ah, she's a fucking asshole. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09Together 17 years. Lucky if one of `em was decent. ASS. FUCKING. HOLE.What I was talking about anyway, Ronimal, is that from what I can deduce, young Timbo Lippe here has led a-- shall I say-- sheltered existence. And I think we oughta help him, y'know, aroo-aroo!The O-Fox!Oh yeah baby. Shag-a-licious!Tim, this is the Queen Bee of ASMI, Joan Ostrowski-Fox. The O-Fox.No she's not.Oh yeah, Jaeger time!Whoa-o here she comes-- she's a man eater!I know. This needs to be private. Whoa. Something didn't agree with you, did it? Second thought, meet me in the stairwell after you wrap things up in here.You sound like my fuckin' wife, Timbo. Jesus. Ex, I should say. EX.Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah. But we didn't get to finish our little confab back at the bar. I figured some shit out. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09Like I told you, no shocker-- Helgesson's buttering you up to get you in his camp, because he knows you and me are close...Close enough. You're voting for me for President, right?Well anyway, there's a petition going around trying to take away your company's Two Diamond Awards.Well hear this: After you left the bar, Mike Pyle comes up to me-- Pyle of shit, I call him-- and he asks do I want to sign this thing. And I go, \"Lemke might have been a class-A deviant, but the guy was tits as a rep...\"Joyce who...? Oh, no-no-no, whoa- whoa-whoa, that old whore called ME. Harping about Lemke being a pervert and how she wants to take her business elsewhere. So I says, \"OK, I'll run some numbers.\" Well, she calls back later that same day, says she got Krogstad to lower her premium. Which is all the greasy twat wanted in the first place.I may be a lot of things, but poacher ain't one of `em.Personally? I think Mike Pyle of Shit started the thing as a way to drive down the price of your agency. Dollars to donuts he wants to swoop in and pick up Northlands at a bargain basement price. And you know what else I think? I think Orin's in on the deal somehow.I can't quite figure it myself, but I know what I know. And what I know is you're wading into some duvious, er dubious, shit. Just be careful.I'm saying a Bridge to the 22nd Century is a stupid theme, Helgesson. Not a goddamn one of us is even going to be alive in the 22nd Century...Stab me in the fucking back why don't you, Wilkes...Timbo! Sorry about that gigantic boner I got while we were spooning.Pyle of shit.Smug fuck. So who's ready for a drink?It's 11 in the morning. Can you believe this guy? C'mon Timbo, let's get the flock outta here.Timbo! Turn around!Come on bud, I was having fun.Let's roll, Perry-- Perry-plegic. Get it, like paraplegic? But...Know what that cow's thinking, Pyle? She's thinking, \"quit pulling on my tits and fuck me already.\"I think I just shit my pants.Timbo and the O-Fox! Wondered when you crazy kids were gonna show up.You tag that yet, Timbo? Bet she's moist as a damp sponge, huh?Shit, what isn't wrong me? I drink too much, I weigh too much, I piss people off. Speaking of, that crank call earlier-- way outta line. People are right, I am an asshole.I love it! \"I guess I've seen worse.\" I love it! Yeah shit, s'pose we all wish our lives had gone a little different. You don't come into this deal going, \"Dear God, please let my wife toss me out on my ass. Please give my children the courage to hate my fucking guts. Thank you Jesus. Praise Jesus! Praise Jesus!\" Ach, I'm just having fun. (crosses himself, looksMaybe you two should take one of those gay cruises together.Ha! I love it! Richard head!Would you rather toss a bum's salad, y'know, eat out his butthole or... give your dad a B-J?Check this out-- Captain Nemo!Hell yeah.Suck my ass, Helgesson.Come on, Ronimal! My key got wet. Wake up, man! Ah, fuck it.Timbo! Ronimal!You should have stuck around last night, Ronimal. Watching Timbo and the O-Fox get it on in the pool-- shit, I was harder than Chinese arithmetic.That time of the month? C'mon man, it's gonna be OK.C'mere, kiddo. Sit. Sit down. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09My ex, Patti? Well-established fact that this broad is a serious fucking cuntstain, right? But like I say, she's made it pretty much so the kids hate my guts-- I'm the bad guy. `Cept when our 17-year-old daughter comes home PREGNANT-- oh yeah, happy day in the Ziegler household, lemme tell ya-- who's the one so depressed that she can't get out from under the afghan on the goddamn couch? Patti. And who's the one planning the baby showers and taking Meg to the gyno, all that shit? The fucking Deanzie. That's who.I'm telling you this, buddy, because it shows to go ya-- even if you're a fucking waste of space jerk-off like myself, there's always opportunities to do the right thing. If this Two Diamond bullshit and that matters so much, you'll find a way to make it right. If not, fuck it. Life's way too short to lose sleep over shit that don't matter.Vote for Deanzie. Vote for change.Well fuck you very much, Carla.I can count on your vote tomorrow, right Ronimal?You're all a bunch of dicks.Are you ready for this? Mike Pyle of Shit just bought Northlands. Word is the cocksucker's liquidating Timbo and the whole Brown Valley operation.Cry me a fucking river, honey. This isn't about you for once.You two are a couple of serious fucking downers, man. Timbo left here in a huff a few hours ago-- you saw him Ronimal. Maybe he already knew. Shit, the kid's one of my best friends...Know what, blow me Ronald. It's not my fault you're too goddamn afraid to open up and tell another man you love him. Do what you want, but the Deanzie's gonna make sure his friend is doing OK.Trying to reach Tim Lippe. Who am I talking to?That right? Is he there now?Who's Ken?I'll be standing by `case things get squirrelly in there. Getaway vehicle type scenario. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09Mm-mow-mow... Two tickets to paradise. Hmm-hmm, pack your bags we'll leave tonight... Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09Oh fuck!What the fuck happened?The Ronimal!Wasn't just Krogstad, Timbo. Orin's the real devil in this deal.Sleep good, little friend.Hey Travis, I don't think Tim...Fuck yeah Timbo!What's the fucking charge?What's this?\"Butt ram!\" I love it!Want your get out of jail free card back?When I saw it, at first I was like, shit am I supposed to take money out of the account, or what?Nah, it was more fun watching the smug fuck sweat. I told him I'd rat his pathetic ass out if he didn't drop the charges against you.I'll show you some real wood.Well, pal, it's been real.Listen, my cousin Bob-- guy made a truckload selling these little scented pine trees all the ragheads hang in their cabs? Fuckin' believe that? Anyhow, he's got a sweet cottage up on Lake of the Woods. Canada? I can use it whenever I want. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09I say we book it for June, before the mosquitoes go apeshit up there.Done.What was with the fuckin' unicorn?Jesus-- a retarded kid just sitting there yelling would've been better

Because that's a pretty updated uniform there.Oh, is that where a bunch of guys sit around a table looking up the word \"gullible\" in a dictionary?Indeed I am. I'm here for ASMI, too. In from Oh-my-god, Nebraska. Just kidding-- Omaha. Ugh, I am gross, so I'm going to bid you farewell, Tim Lippe. See you at Horizons tonight?Unless you were planning on spying on me in the shower.God, I am evil. I need help.Hubba-hubba, check out these studs.Here she is, Miss America.Yup. And boy are my arms tired.No, not really. I drove. Deanzie, let me say... ... you look maah-velous!Hey! It's Tim \"don't get lippy with me\" Lippe.Oh yeah, and I was very naughty in there. I'm sorry about that, Tim.No I'm not. Shots! What'll it be, gentlemen?Lippe?Careful you don't get too loaded, Lippe, or I might have to take advantage of you.I'm a very bad girl. But I swear I only smoke in Cedar Rapids. Care for a Virginia Slim, Lippe? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09Whoa, what's wrong?D'you want me to kick his butt?Absolutely. I know Krogstad. I could take him. `Sides, I'm a ninja. A nin- jette, actually. Hoo-waaaah! So Lippe, how'd you end up in the insurance game? God that sounded dorky-- insurance game. Look here, see, how'd you end up in the insurance game, see...?Oh my God. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09No way. Really?I remember that. Massive disaster.You realize you just made it sound cool to be an insurance salesman? You are a hero, Lippe.No, I can tell. You're the Superman type. Kind of dweeby on the surface but a real frickin' stud underneath. They'd call you Insurance Man-- put a big red \"I\" on your chest...Well, you're welcome. So can you fly me back to the hotel, Insurance Man? I'm freezing my arse off.Yeah, what was that call?You are very weird...Really? Why?Taco Bill.Heck yeah! I get to be Insurance Man's sidekick. We're going to kick some ASS!Whoo-hoo.Ooh, that's hot...Look at you...What a gyp. There are no stinkin' clues in here.Why would you possibly know that?Ugh. I'm gonna puke.Oh my God, did you just make a dick joke, Lippe?That doesn't even... There's no such thing as silo ice climbing.Of course you did. Well, you can do it then...You need to get over it, Lippe, cuz I'm not climbing jack. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09Come on Insurance Man-- leap tall buildings in a single bound and all that...Hi Millie! Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09I'll just meet you inside.That's really nice. Cheers.So Lippe, I'm trying to figure you out. Hopes, dreams, aspirations, blah-blah-blah? Whaddaya got?Dream the impossible dream...C'mon, man. I mean fantasy-land stuff. What do you really want?Oh, screw him. He wants to sell, why don't you just buy Northlands?Why not? You could get a loan.You know the business. You know the clients. You actually care about your job. You'd be perfect. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09Yeah well, you can have mine.Tyler's ten. Ashley'll be eight next month. My little squirrels.My hubby. Rich Fox. Richie. We met when we were both Rotary exchange students in high school. Lived in Norway for a semester.I was such a spaz. Band geek, total ugly duckling-- braces, acne, the whole nine. I didn't even get boobs until college. Anyway, we ended up getting married sophomore year. Then kids. Then blah-blah-blah, and here we are. Richie's a Supervisor in the Parks Department now. For the County.I know it's effed up. And if I had it all to do over again, I don't know what I'd choose. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09But I don't have that option. So this is my fantasy-land, Tim. Cedar Rapids. ASMI. This. I come here, and for a few days I'm someone else. No kids. No husband. No responsibility. Wild woman. Sometimes a gal just needs a vacation from who she really is-- know what I mean, Lippe?One what?No, let's hear it...You wanna be on American Idol?That's great, Tim. You'll do it. I know you will. Very cool.Wanna get one for the road, stud?One nightcap. It'll loosen you up.What?Coors Lite's good for me, thanks. I gotta run wash my hands quick.Shots! Kamikazes, good sir.Why wait for the church choir when you can take care of one of your dreams right now, dude?I know you can do it, Lippe. Go be my hero-- Insurance Man. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09Whaddaya say, Lippe? Take a dippy?So we stay in the shallow end. And neither did I.So.So.Cuddle? Um. OK. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09No baby, you guys are playing at Papillion/La Vista. Ralston is next week... Calm down, Tyler. You're not gonna miss it. It's not that far. Put your dad on.Hey. Did you not look at the schedule on the fridge? Did we not have this conversation 10 minutes before I left? No, no, no. The playoffs are in Ralston. This is the last regular season game. He actually has a chance to play, Richie. Christ.Fine, but watch your speed on 84th by Giles Road. Chris Beeler's gotten busted twice right there. By that golf course. Yeah, Tara Hills. Exactly. OK. Love you, too. Bye. Oh, tell Ty to kick some butt for me. `K. See ya.Crisis on the home front. Sorry if I woke you up.Your cell phone kept ringing in your little fanny pack thing, so I shut it off. When I saw the discs, I figured I'd take a look. It's a solid presentation.Yeah, I see that. You know we were together right?It's so stupid-- but everyone basically treated us like the Brangelina of ASMI for a while there. It ended two years ago. He was getting into some pretty weird stuff... as we all know now.Come on, Lippe. It doesn't matter. You knew, didn't you?Tell me you're not jealous. You can't be jealous. The guy's dead.As good? Tim, Roger was a small- minded, egotistical jerk. You're an infinitely better man than he was.Why? I don't know. I don't know. I guess I probably maybe don't like myself very much. I don't know.What are you talking about?What this? What are you talking about? There's no this. There's no us. I have a family. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09What about it? I told you, what I do here... In Cedar Rapids... It stays here.Come on, Tim. We're adults here. You're acting like a child...We used to get bands, Ronald. Real bands. Kansas. REO Speedwagon... Remember REO let me get on stage and play tambourine?Don't look at me. I don't think Tim likes me very much anymore.Fuck off, Dean. Jackass.Oh man. This place is bad news.So you're sending me into that shithole? How chivalrous, Dean.Thanks. Thank you. That's nice.Oh shit.Oh my God, Tim. Are you OK?You'll find another job, Lippe. Maybe even move to a new town.Get some sleep you guys. I'll stay up with him-- make sure he doesn't chew his arm off.It doesn't matter. Here, lie down, Lippe.Oh dear, what can the matter be Johnny's so long at the fair. He promised to bring me a pocket of posies...Oh shit...Deep subject. D'aar. Get it? I told you you were a hero, Lippe. Insurance Man saves the day!True sign of a good day.So. Keep in touch.
