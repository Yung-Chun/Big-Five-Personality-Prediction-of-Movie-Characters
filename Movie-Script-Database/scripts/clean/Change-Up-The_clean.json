{"Change-Up-The": {"DAVE": {"raw_line": "Sorry Hank.Can't-see ...must...persevere... He finishes changing Sarah, places her back in her crib, then picks up Sarah's twin brother, PETER, from his crib -- which is good because he's been SLAMMING his head against the wall.Come on, buddy, we've talked about the head thing-- Dave places Peter on the changing table and opens his diaper. It's only wet, and Dave, pleasantly relieved, reaches for a fresh diaper...Oh no.Please, sweetheart, not my-- Honey, Daddy needs those--Take me with you Magnum P. I... Before long Dave is CRYING like a schoolgirl.Please take me with you...Terrific! Just terrific. We are nowAren't they? Yes. Always. Good morning, Rebecca.All but signed.Thank you, sir.No sir, absolutely not. So sorry. Dave quickly undoes his tie as Flemming turns down a hallway. SABRINA McARDLE, cute young paralegal, falls into step with Dave, stymieing laughter.Last week he told me my shoes were \"dangerously Italian.\"Thanks, Sabrina.I have no idea what you're talking about, Gladys... Reddening, he snatches a huge pile of pink message slips and hurries towards his office. She follows him, scolding:Yes, thank you, I almost forgot about them for like two seconds...Gladys, I'm a grown man, okay? He angrily punches \"SPEAKER\" on his RINGING phone as he reties his tie with a more traditional knot.Lockwood. A shrill, horribly impersonated British accent fills Dave's office -- as well as all of the surrounding offices.Jesus, Mitch, I'm at work--Dude, how stoned are you?Come on, it's 10 in the morning.What?That is great news.Kind of. Is there a reason you're calling or--?Dude, I'm coming--Really? Whose feelings?Look, just, what time are you picking me up tonight?Dude, I get it, I'm coming--Oh, I'm a Many-Spotted Skipperling man all the way. The Southern Monarch is just a glorified moth.Oh, I'm sorry, sugar-bug... Dave looks genuinely concerned. Cara just shrugs and keeps reading her butterfly book. Jamie whispers to him:Right, of course. Jamie finally notices Dave's foam-covered face, and softens.Of course he's early. All he does all day is eat hummus and masturbate.Bathed, changed and in their Pis. Mitch turns to see Dave in khakis and a buttondown, entering the kitchen with the freshly bathed twins. Mitch grins:I'll be back right after the game, okay, Pumpkin?Yeah, I'm good.Yeah, well, you're driving, so... Mitch shrugs and slides the spare beer into his chest pocket.You found another futon?Nice. What movie?Sounds cool.I hope you get it, man.No, man, I got a big day tomorrow, I can't get wasted tonight.He's no Fernando.OH! So finish your story! The girl calls you up...?What's her name?Incredible. What's her last name? Mitch just looks at him.Is she hot? She is, right? Oh my God I already have a boner!NO! Keep going! I need these stories, man! They're all I have. Mitch registers the desperation in his married friend's eyes.Oh my God how big?Oh my God she sounds like Sabrina.This hot paralegal in my office.What's a Cancer List?That's sick, man. Jamie is the mother of my children...Just finish your story, man! I'm dying over here!I don't even know what those are!That is maybe the single greatest story I've ever heard in my life.I don't know why...I don't know why I've always been in such a rush, you know?You remember me in high school, I was always so focussed on getting into a good college, then when I got to college, I was so focussed on getting into a good law school, then in law school I was just trying to land a job at a good firm, then Jamie and I got married and we had Cara right away-- I just feel like and I missed out on all the fun stuff, you know? The sex, the drugs, the bad choices, and now it's too late. I blew it. I pissed away my 20's, and now I'm staring down the barrel a seriously boring life.No, I know--Wait, what?Don't get me wrong, I love my kids, I do, I would take a bullet for them, but...remember that heroin addict you dated?Jesus, how many heroin addicts have you dated?Anyway. Having kids is like dating a heroin addict, only instead of dating them, they move into your house for 18 years. They're laughing one second and crying the next and then they're trying to kill themselves in your bathroom for no reason. They're mean and selfish and they burn through all your money and they steal your shit and they break everything and they stay up all night and they listen to really shitty music and the dirty secret is, no one actually likes kids.No! It's true. Everyone pretends to like kids because if you don't you look like a huge dick. It's like Drew Barrymore or jazz. No one actually likes them, but if you say that out loud, everybody hates you.I'm just saying: don't fuck up your life like I did, okay?Wait, what--?Tatiana! I want Tatiana! I want sex with strange new women and maybe also with Sabrina if she's single and I want to wake up at noon and smoke weed all afternoon and I want to not think about the needs of four other people 24 hours a day and I want to start reading a novel and actually finish it and I want to take a solid shit because I'm not constantly stressed out and I want to learn how to rollerblade and also I really want to pee...Bingo. They stumble over to the fountain, unzip their pants, and, leaning on each other, begin peeing into it. Mitch glances up at the GREEK GODDESS METIS. She scowls down at them.Maybe she has three kids and a job she hates.I'm just saying...I envy your life.Yeah you don't--No, I do--!R-Rolling blackout?You really have nice flow by the way. Very thick and confident.Thank you. My urologist says I run a little warm. Eventually they both finish, tuck in, and zip up. Beat.You good to drive?Mitch...?Why am I in your sad apartment--Fine, Jesus, relax-- Dave opens the door to see himself standing there.What the fuck is this...? Dave backpedals, terrified, as Mitch blows inside, furious.Oh my God...I'm a fucking loser...How the fuck did this happen?!What, switching bodies with another human being?! Oh yeah, this shit happens to me like twice a week!Oh, you don't want to be me?! No, no, no: I don't want to be you!Look, let's just.. .think. How could this have possibly happened...? They pace about the apartment, trying to think... Then:Not dreaming.Wait, what'd you just say?Come on!Remember last night when we peed into that fountain?! As we peed, we wished we had each other's lives!Our wishes must've... somehow... come true.Well apparently urine works too.We're gonna hug each other and pee into the fountain and wish our lives back!Where did you take it?!Who could tell us where it is?!When will it be in the computer?!Tomorrow?! We can't wait until tomorrow, Carla!We'll call you tomorrow! Thank you!We should just go home and lock theThis is fucking Mitch?Okay ...Okay...Great...Thank you.Marty Green, the producer of Busted Dreams 4. Apparently the guy they cast for Steve Action OD'd last night, and the back-up actor got deported, so, alphabetically, you're the next actor on the list. You got the part, man. Mitch covers his mouth like he just won American Idol.Oh my God: and I've got my closing today.A big--?! Yeah! Whether or not I make partner is riding on this!No. No. We can't just be each other for a day, Mitch! You have no idea how to be a lawyer!First of all, it's Busted Dreams 4, okay? It's not The Reader. Second of all, I'm a WASP, I've spent my entire life acting happy and no one has ever questioned my performance, okay?! They look at each other, cooling off a bit...Are...Are we actually considering doing this...?All right, well, my meeting starts in 45 minutes. You need to race home, get dressed, then go to my office and find my secretary Gladys-No. Get the merger docs from Gladys and take them to the conference room. All the partners will be there so do not speak to anyone.NO! No vamping! And once the meeting starts, you will continue to say nothing. When a partner asks you for the merger documents, you will silently hand them over, okay?No! Play it small. Really small. I've spent the last nine months banging out the terms of this deal, all you have to do is hand over the documents. That's it.I'm trusting you, too...Oh hey, you also need to pick up Cara from ballet at 4, okay?Yo, Mitch Planko is here. Where the fuck is Hair & Makeup?That's so real. Dave stiffly walks off as the P.A. eyes him, weirded out.No thanks. Hey, what does it mean when it says T.S., or B.T.S.?Wait! W-what kind of movie is this?!I-I'm not familiar with that genre.Oh no. They arrive inExcuse me, are you in charge here? I think there's been some sort ofA bump--? Of drugs?Is this actually happening?If you let me don't in...don't let me in...If you don't let me in, Paco, I will fuck you dead. That doesn't sound right. If you don't let me Taco-- is his name Paco or Taco? Your penmanship is illegible--Oh my goodness it is Lola my long lost lover Lola who...I love. Her.I'm sorry! I can't!Look, I can't, I'm married.No, I mean, me, in real life. I'm married.I dry-humped a stranger's leg for three hours today... Sitting opposite him, Mitch downs a shot, exhausted.Oh no -- what happened at work?Oh my God tell me you're kidding.What. 1The truth.Hey, sugar-bug. .but she passes right by him and hugs Mitch.Okay, I don't sound like that-- Just then Jamie hurries past, the twins in her arms, and kisses Mitch on the lips. Both men startle a bit.This is so weird.Right -- no, thank you. I'm-- Look, Jamie, we really need to talk.I. .um...I'm not Mitch.Then the city moved the fountain--Baby, please don't--Look, I can prove it's true! Just, I don't know, just ask me anything that only I -- that only Dave -- would know. Anything.Spring?Why do you know that?Look, just ask me anything else.You have a favorite color?Dude: do you not understand what we're trying to accomplish here?!Baby -- Jamie -- ask me anything else, something more personal...Yourrrrr mother maybe?I have a lot on my plate right now, man! You have no idea!Are you joking? You worked at my job for one day and you almost got arrested! What are you gonna do to my family?!What do you tell Jamie.. .when?But it's Tuesday.That's adorable. Dave turns and exits the house, still LAUGHING...You know what, give it a shot.Sure, have at it! Let me know how it goes...Jesus, it's like a Swedish asylum--Mitch Planko, who the fuck is this? A sexy woman's voice purrs:Tatiana?! Hi! How, um, how are you?Oh my God. Oh my God. He quickly dials a number.Tatiana is on her way over!What do you think I should do?!But wouldn't I be...sort of... cheating on Jamie? Maybe?But my mind is over here, doesn't that count... somehow?Millions.Your reasoning is oddly impeccable.Jesus ...I haven't had sex with another woman since college...Oh my God so am I--. There's a KNOCK at the apartment door. Dave jumps, freaked:Holy shit she's already here! What do I do?!Tatiana...I-I honestly don't know... She throws off her trenchcoat to reveal she's not wearing anything underneath. Awesome. Less awesome is the fact that she's NINE MONTHS PREGNANT. Massive breasts sit atop a huge, distended, veiny, protruding stomach. Dave recoils.But you're--?! When are you due?!Oh god gross! Wait, who's the father? Am I the father?!Holy shit you're so heavy--Actually that's probably just the colostrum coming in, it can be veryNothing! Nothing. I just--No...?No! I love the coat.Well...now that you mention it? Maybe, like, a little?Look, Tatiana, I'm sorry. You're incredibly beautiful, it's just--Oh my god I can see it kicking. You can, in fact, see the fetus moving around in her belly.Oh come on... What?What? No!Look, I had to, I never get this kind of privacy anymore.Yeah. I guess. Is that weird?It sort of hooks to the side a bit.Cool, thanks. Hey, how long have you been shaved down there?Really?Yeeeah, Tatiana might not be coming back. Like, ever.Me?! She's nine months pregnant!I could see the baby kicking, dude!Relax, Mitch--Jesus, okay, I'm sorry...Look, is there a reason you're calling me at 3 in the morning? Mitch glares back to the twins, who are still WAILING.Have you changed their diapers already?Okay, take them to the kitchen.Go to the fridge... Mitch turns away from the twins and opens the fridge. He sees a bottle of wine and immediately drinks from the bottle.Defrost two bags of breastmilk in the microwave for 3 minutes, then prepare two separate bottles... Mitch grabs a container of cow's milk, sniffs it, turns to give it to the babies -- to discover that Sarah is gone, and Peter is licking an ELECTRICAL SOCKET!What was that?First: attach the filter to the seal to the nipple... Mitch hears CLINK CLINK and spins to see that Sarah has crawled over to the KNIFE BLOCK and removed a BUTCHER KNIFE and a MEAT CLEAVER and is waving them about like rattles!I know, right? And make sure you don't allow any air bubbles in. Mitch grabs a pair of tongs and, after a few attempts, snatches the butcher knife from Sarah's hands. Then he scoops her up and deposits her into the sink with her brother. Finally, he slumps over, trying to catch his breath.Great. So where's the fountain?WHAT? How long can it possibly take you to find your own fountain?!Thanks, Carla, you just ruined my life. Have an awesome day. Dave blows out of there, choking on his fury...Mitch?! Mitch?! Bad news, buddy! Dave bounds up the stairs...Real bad news--! Jamie startles and quickly dries her eyes.Are you okay...? Dave enters, concerned, and instinctively starts helping her dress the babies. She watches him, a bit confused.Come on, you can tell me. We've been friends forever...Oh my god I'm going to fucking kill him.No. Jamie. I swear he's not. You're just going through a very temporary rough patch, okay?Y-You have?!No I really do. Tell me everything. Jamie looks at him, sees the urgency in his eyes. Frowns.well poor Jamie! You have an ambitious, hard-working husband who provides for you and your family -- how can you even stand it?It means we might be in each other's bodies for a while...My life sucks?! You drive a Fiero-- Jamie calls through the door:Listen to me: I know I complain about my family sometimes, but Jamie and the kids are everything to me... My marriage is falling apart, my job is on the line, and I need you to step up and be the best possible version of me, okay?Well. Then I'm just gonna have to teach you. Let's start at theThis is called a suit. You have to wear one every day, along with--No! No more commando! You are a grown-ass man! Mitch mimics heiling Hitler and starts getting dressed...This is called a schedule. It tells you everything you need to do in a given day. Drop offs. Pick ups. Activities. Playdates. Doctors appointments. You'll notice that there are approximately 50 hours worth of obligations on any given day. Find a way.Always be thinking of your next responsibility. It helps to break your day into four minute increments. And remember: there is no margin for error.If you pick up the twins, the drycleaning and the diaper cream but forget the organic quince paste from that little place on Abbot Kinney, everyone still hates you. You have to be perfect.This is called a grocery store. You buy food here. Before heading to the market, always call Jamie first and ask her if she needs anything. In fact, before you make anV decisions in your life, no matter how small, call your wife first. Think of yourself as a retarded mule lost in the desert: helpless, dumb, and in constant need of direction. Never take initiative, never strike out on your own, never deviate from the plan: you are always wrong. You are a retarded mule lost in the desert.When you're with Jamie, you should always be doing one of three things: asking her permission, complimenting her, or begging her forgiveness. It doesn't matter if she already said you could go to poker night, or if she looks like fucking Mothra in that dress, or if you didn't do anything wrong. Permission, compliments, apologies. That's all anyone wants to hear out of a husband's mouth. Here, let's practice: what's your favorite joke?Trick question! No one fucking cares! You're Dave Lockwood, boring dad, you're not Jerry Fucking Seinfeld! Shut the fuck up! Mitch clutches his balls, hurt and scared...These are called children, or dependents. Never disparage your own children -- everything they do is a miracle from God. When they're bad, it's only because they're tired or going through a phase. When other people's kids are bad, however, it's because of indulgent parenting or innate defects in theOne a piece, please, Dylan.This is called an office, or work. Think about whatever you most want to do here, and then do the exact opposite. You want to go home early? Great: stay all night. Hungry? Cool: don't eat. Think your boss is a total douche? Terrific: invite him to join your fantasy baseball league. A cute ASSOCIATE walks by and Mitch overtly eye-fucks her all the way past. Dave nut-punches him again.You're married now, jackass! You can't look at other women, you can't talk to other women, you can't even be interesting around other women! Do everything in your power to de-sexualize yourself -- wear a fannypack, drive a Passat, affix electronic devices to your belt -- whatever it takes. If you're forced to interact with a woman, quickly find a way to mention that you're married. It doesn't even have to make sense. Just be like \"Nice weather today, I'm totally fucking married.\"It's called marriage. Dave turns into his office, nodding at his mean secretary.Good morning, Gladys. She scowls at him, confused, who's this guy? Then Mitch passes and wiggles his tongue at her, simulating cunnilingus. The old lady GASPS, appalled...Do you have any other questions?Have you been listening to one word I've said?! There is no fucking free time! You don't have a life anymore! You don't have a personality, or an identity, or a point of view! You are a dad!Your job is to allocate resources, to shuttle children from A to B, to deliver food at appropriate intervals, to clean up, to break down, to construct, to repair, to finance, to sooth, to make everyone else happy, okay? And when your day is done, you know what you get?Nothing! You're not single anymore! No one gives you a cupcake every time you hold the door or speak in complete sentences, it's expected of you now, so grow up!Two days? Are you kidding me?! Sabrina glances at Dave, confused, no idea who he is.And that is Level 4 Sexual Harassment! Awesome! Thanks, Sabrina, that will be all.Oh. I'm sorry, no. I'm Mitch, Dave's completely idiotic friend.What?Oh my god I'm so fucking fired.You can't talk to women like that at work! Or anywhere, really!I'm not going on the date, Mitch.No. I'm not.Why...Why are you doing this to me?I haven't been on a first date in over a decade and I'm drowning in my own fear--!How do I look?!Jeans? To a restaurant? Mitch punches Dave in the nuts; he doubles over.I can't believe you just charged a Ferrari to my Discover Card.What are we gonna tell Jamie...?What?It's been so long since I felt cool...Why are we washing the car? It's brand new.You mean like J-date?What's a Lady Gaga?So wait, why are we at a car wash?Come on, I talk to women all the time, I don't need to practice.Yes. And no offense, as a married man, I probably know how to talk to women better than you do.Yes! It's not that hard. They just want to be respected and listened to like everybody else.Hello there what's your name?! She doesn't even look up from her BlackBerry. Dave's confidence instantly crumbles...I-I'm sorry, I'm not trying to hit on you. I'm just...I mean, I'm married, so that's not even a thing. W-W-Where are you from--? Mitch appears and yanks him away. Dave looks traumatized:Was she reaching for her rape whistle?Your name is Dora? Like the Explorah?! No...? You aren't familiar with that show...?So: what school district do you live in?Yikes, what do your parents think of all those piercings?!.and that's the difference between a stroller and a pram.I forgot how hard it is to be single...I don't feel good about this.I know, always use an alias.Hey. Hi. Hello. He awkwardly goes to kiss her cheek while she goes for a handshake. It's awkward/cute.Oh -- whoop -- okay. They sit. Dave stares at her, terrified. Then he blurts out:Do you like Googoo Lady?!I-I don't know! I really don't! Sabrina smiles politely and looks around for a waiter. Dave winces, hating himself to the very core of his being...M-My whole life, actually.What, like a total douchebag? She LAUGHS. Dave can't believe it. He loosens up a bit.That's not fair. Dave...Dave isn't himself right now. I hope he didn't say anything to offend you...So. You like working with Dave?Isn't he just?No, go on.Right. Obviously. Well, I'm just like Dave, only way more handsome. She laughs. Dave smiles back, his confidence growing, as weWell, I had a great time...Right! No! What are we, lame married people? Let's go to a rave...or something? Do people... still do that? Raving?Now that was a first date...I know. I'm not even sure he understood the rules... She laughs. Then they stop in front of her apartment. Beat.Yeah. Me too... There's a lull for a kiss. Dave hesitates...so Sabrina moves in and kisses him. It's sweet but passionate... When it's over, Dave can barely speak:Can...Can, um, can I call you sometime? Do people still say that?Okay. Well. Good night, Sabrina.Fuck that. He rolls over and goes back to sleep, a smile on his face...Well, well, look who's all growns up.Are...Are you kidding me?Wow. Okay. Well, I just wanted t tell you that if you can get a protracted buyout for anything over 700 million dollars, take it, okay?Also, I wanted to thank you for setting me up with Sabrina. She's amazing. I can't wait to see herWhich reminds me, I wanted to call to see if she got the flowers...Really? Who's your favorite Dodger?It's too soon to say I love you, right? That's against the rules? she laughs and kisses him.Mitch Planko who the fuck is this.Oh my God, hi! Dave steps away to take the call. Carla does another whippet.What's.. .going on?And... and how long is it going to be there?And after that?Right. Okay, well thanks, Carla. Hello?Yeah... We should probably switch back, huh? Mitch high-fives a co-worker.Yeah, and I was just starting to enjoy yours, too...Really.I'm so glad you said that.And I love yours! All the free time and the fun activities and I'm really growing as an actor and I think Sabrina might actually have intercourse with me tonight!So, wait, what are we talking about here? Staying like this... forever:Right! That's crazy... Beat.It's so strange, when the change-up happened, we were so focussed on switching back into our bodies that we didn't even consider that this might be exactly what we both needed...All right, well, see ya, Dave...You find anything that fits? Then Sabrina appears in the doorway, wearing one of his old tee shirts-and panties.. .and nothing else... she's unreal...Please don't come, please don'tOh my God: a Many-Spotted Skipperlinq... And everything comes rushing back. His family. His wife. His entire life. He looks overcome with emotion... Sabrina notices as she slides onto the couch with him.Yeah, no, I just... Dave rubs his temples, overwhelmed...I can't do this.No I'm not! I'm so not!Umm...she's...uh...this just got very complicated...What?!Look, Jamie, I didn't know about Gladys, I swear. But I'm sure she means absolutely nothing to Dave--!Look, I know I haven't been a very good husband or father recently...But I'm done looking over the fence for something better. I've seen what's on the other side, and it's great. . .and young... and supple... but it's not you. And the truth is there will always be another fence with shinier toys on the other side, but the only way to be happy is to say fuck the fence and just appreciate what you have, you know? Find the fun with what you got...I'm so sorry I stopped appreciating you, pumpkin. I love you. And I love our weird little kids. And I can't believe I ever thought that wasn't enough.Nothing happened, I swear.Yes. Totally.Absolutely: therapy, trust falls, The Landmark Forum, Eat Pray Love, I'll do whatever the fuck you want, Jamie, I just want you back... She smiles and kisses him again. And then again.Yeah, I noticed. I'm not sure how I feel about this.Oh shit! We gotta go!Mitch! Get in!Get in!No. Jamie knows about the change- up. We're all good.Really, dude?You know what? I don't want to know! Let's just hope we get to the warehouse before they ship off our fountain... Off Dave's concerned look weThere it is! Jamie screeches up to a warehouse labelled L.A. DEPARTMENT OF PARKS; she, Mitch and Dave pile out of the car and run intoThere! Four WORKMEN pack the FOUNTAIN OF METIS into a large wooden crate for transport. Jamie, Mitch and Dave run over to them.We...We need that fountain.It's a magic fountain. The workmen just look at them, deadpan. Then Dave reaches into his wallet and starts pulling out CASH--Come on, open the floodgates!Well I can't keep going forever! Mitch tilts his head back and quietly sings to himself:Are you singing Randy Newman--? Then we hear a second stream of PEE hit the fountain.Okay, quick, we have to hug!Yes, we have to do everything exactly the same! Come on! As they scootch together and put their arms around each other, Mitch calls over to the workmen:Come on: \"I wish I had my old life back\" on three! One, two:You think it worked?Oh thank God. Thank God. Pumpkin, it worked! I'm back!You just vomited on my hand but I love yooooou...The twins are down for their nap, Cara is watching The Backyardigans... Jamie raises her eyebrow, oh?I know.Tuesdays, Wednesdays, mornings, late night, I'm like Denny's, baby, I'm open 24-7. She laughs, and he scoops her up and heads upstairs...Sugar-bug!So. How's it going with Sabrina?Wow. Good for you. Mitch nods, proud, I know. Swigs his beer.Maybe.I can't believe they're family friends.Oh yeah. Dave flips the burgers.Hey, the CEO owed me a favor...I think so too. Just then, MITCH'S DAD approaches.Is it weird that I miss your penis?", "clean_line": "sorry hank persevere finishes changing sarah places crib picks sarah twin brother peter crib good slamming head

"MITCH": {"raw_line": "I'm pretty stoned.Dude, guess what? Great news.I found a futon on the street.I sort of had to fight a bum for it -- is that bad?Are you gonna bitch out on tonight? You are, aren't you. Dave, half-listening, sits at his desk and answers emails.Dodgers-Giants, dude! We haven't missed one of these in like 20 years! Don't be a vajeen!You always do this! You never make time for your friends anymore and I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but people are starting to talk. Feelings are getting hurt.Not mine, because, like a samurai, I have trained myself to feel nothing except revenge and honor, but other people -- nameless, other, more sensitive people -- are hurt, and they think you need to treasure your friendships a little bit more. How concerned should I be that my new futon smells like death?If you bail I will rape you.In your eye. I will eye-rape you.Shit. Mitch starts waving away the pot smoke.Gotta go, pick you up at six--!One sec, Dad! The smoke clears and Mitch jogs to the door and opens it to reveal his father, MITCH, SR., 60's, friendly, in a suit, holding a pile of mail.Oh thanks, I always forget. They hug, and Mitch takes the mail and, without looking at it, chucks it onto a HUGE PILE OF OLD MAIL in the corner.No! Honestly, it's my new futon, it smells like illegal drugs.You got it, Dad.Which one? \"Give Gonorrhea The Boot\" or \"Samir's Pet Shack Our Low Low Prices Are Snake-sational?\"Actually, the real shame is that Samir paid me in fucking organic bird seed, but whatever... He glares at several crates of BIRD SEED by the door.I'm a little tight, actually, Pops. Especially vis a vis, you know, the whole bird seed situation.Can you make it a grand? Mitch's dad smiles to hide his disappointment and hands his 30-year-old son a roll of hundred dollar bills.Yeeeah...I'm not really sure I'm a \"work\" guy, you know what I mean? Plus, I've been getting a ton of auditions recently, so...Thanks, pop. Bones. Mitch, Sr. smiles and awkwardly bumps his son's fist.Batting cages next weekend?Whatup bitches!How's my favorite ballerina?!Oh no, honey, the only style of dancing I support is exotic... He plunks her on the floor and blows intoJesus Christ you could feed Africa with this fridge... As Jamie starts prepping a salad across the kitchen, Mitch raids the fridge, packing his cargo pants with kid's snacks, bagels, yogurts, juice boxes, everything.These leftovers from Morton's?Chimichurri. score. As Mitch chews, he eyes Jamie chopping vegetables.You look hot by the way, Jame. Jamie laughs but clearly doesn't mind the flirtation.No really. I never would've guessed twins.Is Dave still meeting your needs sexually? Jamie just laughs, shaking her head, unbelievable.Oh, did I tell you I ran into Miss Hickam last week at Starbucks?Yeah. She always liked Dave better than me...Fair enough. Anyway, I tried to get her number, but she goes \"I don't date former students,\" so I go, \"great, do you fuck former students?\" and then she calls me a \"potty-mouth degenerate\" and runs out without her coffee. So I got a free venti macchiato, which is cool-Awww! Come to Uncle Mitch... Dave hands the twins to Mitch, and they COO, impishly cute.Oh my God, they smell like heaven had sex with a dryer sheet.Really? The one on the left looks a little downsy.See you, Jame!Really? You're going to make me drink alone?Oh, dude: great news.That's awesome, because I'm made of emotional Teflon and words can't hurt me anymore. No: I auditioned for a major movie role yesterday.It's called Busted Dreams 4. It's about a renegade coroner who reads minds named Jake Action. It's like a sexy Mentalist.Yeah, I read for the part of Steve Action, Jake's troubled younger brother with a secret, and I fucking killed it. I cried like five times during the audition and it's a fucking action movie. Plus I'm the spitting image of the dude who plays Jake Action, so...Yeah, it could be my Raging Bull. Plus I'd get to kill a lot of women, which is cool. Hotbox?Change-up -- fuck he's good!Of course not. Fernando is like The Highlander. There can be only one.Right! So she calls me up, it's like 3 in the morning--Tatiana.Tatiana Calls-Me-At-3-In-The- Morning-And-Wants-To-Fuck-stein, what the fuck, who cares?Okay, well, you're in luck, because Tatiana is stupid fucking hot. Beautiful face, legs a mile long, perfect ass, blonde hair, and huuuge boobs.Double E.Who's Sabrina?Is she on your Cancer List?Don't all married dudes have a Cancer List? No? Like the first three chicks you would bang if your wife suddenly died of cancer?Who's number two? Fergie--?Fine. So Tatiana's packing double E's, which means like 20 plus pounds of breastmeat -- yeah, it's almost too much for one man to handle. Thank God I'm the son of a butcher and have strong hands and wrists. Anyway, she walks in wearing this tight black dress, and you know what she says to me? Dave shakes his head, on the edge of his bar stool.Nothing. Because all Tatiana wants to do at 3 in the morning is fucky fucky rubber ducky! Dave drunkenly slaps him ten, barely making hand-contact.And look, I'm not one to kiss and tell... but this chick is insatiable. She wants it in every position: Missionary, wheelbarrow, Reverse Wheelbarrow, Assassin--No one does! It gets so intense that my nose starts bleeding. Yeah, so I'm bleeding all over this chick and she's fucking digging it.It's like some weird Dracula Anne Rice shit, and I'm fading in and out of consciousness, and then, when it's all over, she turns to me and goes: \"Tuesday night I'm coming back and we're really going to fuck.\" Dave just stares at him, glassy-eyed, drunk, emotional.Ah, it's not always like that...Oh come on, Jamie is hot!I really want to have sex with her!And your kids are adorable! They're like fun little puppies that talk! The bill comes. Dave pulls out a wad of cash, throws it on the table, and stumbles for the door. Mitch lifts one of Dave's twenties off the table and follows him out...Tara? Or Rena? Or Rachel?It's a national scourge, dude.Oh come on, you don't mean that--Dude, I love Drew Barrymore -- have you seen Boys on the Side? They weave across a LARGE PLAZA, stumbling for Mitch's car.What are you talking about? You've got it all! You've got a huge house full of food and furniture -- shit, your TV is bigger than my car! You have a great job, you make a shit- ton of money, and people respect you, man! My last job involved an ape costume -- do you know what that does to a man? Dave waves him off, not really hearing him. But Mitch is sincere, heartfelt:Plus you've got a hot, extremely fuckable wife who cooks and cleans and takes care of all your needs! It's like having a really hot mom who you can also have sex with!Also you're never lonely, you always have someone to talk to about your day, plus you get to do all the fun gay couple stuff like go to wine country! You think single guys can go to wine country?! No way! They won't even let us in! You're living the dream, dude! What more do you want?!Yeah, me too... They look around the plaza, and their eyes land on the HUGE FOUNTAIN in the middle; a GREEK GODDESS sits atop it.Fountain?This chick does not look happy.Dude, enough already.And that's what's so fucked, because I envy yours.I do!Ummmmm...? Then all the lights in the city flicker back to life...I guess...? They continue peeing, a little freaked out.Thank you. Yours is very steamy.Now I am.Whose fucking baby is that...? A hand emerges and fumbles on the night stand.And where the fuck is my bong? He groggily rises from the sheets -- only it's not Mitch. It's Dave. His body, his face, everything. Yup, you got it: the single auy and the married guy have switched bodies. We will refer to them by their \"brain names,\" thus while this hungover dude definitely looks like Dave, inside he's Mitch, so that's what we'll call him. The actors, of course, will remain in their bodies. Mitch doesn't know any of this yet.Why are there so many fucking pillows...? He rolls over to see Jamie, sitting up in bed, pulling her breasts out of her tank top, getting ready to nurse the twins. Mitch launches out of bed, suddenly very awake.Oh my god that is so gross! Put your tits away! This isn't Europe!Wait: why am I in...? Did I sleep here last night?!Did we...?! Panicked, he thrusts his fist like, have sex?!So why the hell did I wake up in your bed?!Look, just, where's Dave?!Where's fucking Dave?!Oh my God... Oh my God... He slowly touches his new face...I'm a fucking tool.Fucking open the fucking door! Dave stops, noticing that he's in Mitch's empty apartment.The door, dude! Open the door!I knew it!I know, dude.Wait, what? Dave spins, completely awake now:How should I know?! Has this ever happened to you before?!Well...I don't want to be you!What's that supposed to mean?!Bingo. Got it. We're dreaming. Dave grabs Mitch's nipple and twists it hard.Ow ow ow, fuck!First of all, you're a penis. Second of all--I called you a penis and--I thought wishes came true when you threw a coin into a fountain...That's bullshit! I would've wished for something way cooler!What are we gonna do when we get to the fountain?!That might sound really gay! Both men race around the corner onto the plaza and stop cold:Excuse me! Where is the fountain?!Well of course it's not--!How can you lose a fountain?.This is so fucked...I don't talk like that, dude--Who was that?Oh my God! Oh my God! Dreams really do come true--!What, is that like a big deal?So what the hell are we gonna do? PANICKED SILENCE. Then Mitch looks at Dave...Dude, I'm an actor, a human chameleon, I can do lawyer in my fucking sleep! It's you I'm worried about: you can't act for shit!I mean, we have to...right? Both men look highly anxious. Dave glances at the time.She sounds hot, is she hot?Really? Because I can vamp--Dude, I get it. Play it big, but maintain my reality--Dude, that's easy as fuck. Okay, for me, go home, put on some cool clothes, and get to set -- all the info is on my phone. Once you're there, go to Hair & Makeup and memorize your lines and try not to be a total douche to everyone, okay? This is the film industry. Everyone is really cool. They look at each other, very doubtful that this will work...I'm trusting you, dude...Power hug. They hug tight then release.I'm so fucking all over that shit. Off of Dave's deeply unsettled look, weHoly dick, are you Gladys? You're a lynx.A white-haired cougar. You really should dress sexier, though. The whole angry prison nurse thing is a huge mistake. Gladys GASPS and jams some documents into his hands.Hey, where's my meeting at? She angrily points at a conference room as she stalks off.What up, white people?! Republican Party in the house, am I right?! Come on, let's get started!Dave Lockwood, thanks for coming! Dave Lockwood, I did all the work! Dave Lockwood-san, konichi-wa! Anyone need anything? Mimosa, spicy tuna roll? No? We're good? All right, guys, take it away! Mitch takes one of the last open seats -- at the head of the conference table. It's clearly in his boss's seat. Flemming Steel III hovers awkwardly.Fuck yeah! Amalgamated Industries! Finally, even Flemming claps as well, uncomfortable.Right, my bad-- Thinking that's his cue, he slides Flemming the documents.Okay?G-Good?Bad? Bad! They're fucking terrible.Look, everything's cool, let's just sign this fucking thing and go party! We're all rich, who cares?! Mr. Kinkabe angrily jabs his finger at the incredibly short CEO of Amalgamated Industries, TED NORTON, 60's.Relax, dude ... this-this is all part of my master plan.Yes! Check it out: if we drag this out...we make more money, right? Don't we? Of course we do! And then we can bill the fuck out of them! Some of them don't even speak-ah the engrish so goo, you know what I'm saying?Yes...? Is it...? It's not a very good plan, is it.Fuck that, ese. I'm straight up gangster all the way through. Flemming eyes him, determining his fate. Mitch can't breathe.Whatever, you're fine -- hey, what's up with that little blonde bitch who knocked you over? She looks a little surprised by her dad's language.So why don't you fight back?Fuck verbal resolution! Put that whore on her back and shank her! Do you know how to make a shiv?Listen to me, kid: the world is a cesspool of cruelty and violence. If someone comes at you with a knife, you gotta put their entire fucking family in the morgue, okay? That's called jailyard justice. Because if you don't come back hard on a bitch, your ass is gonna get sold for a pack of Camel Lights and a jello cup, y'understand? Always solve your problems with violence. Always. Cara nods, alarmed.Cry me a river, dude: I dealt with ballet and your ass-hat boss today.Nothing! Nothing. I fixed it. Okay, but look, it was not my fault! The Japs started peppering me with questions and I had to improvise and then everyone got very emotional and, well... it looks like we're going to court.Yeah, your boss was pretty miffed, but then I told him this was all part of my master plan to make more money off our clients--Yeah, turns out that's totally illegal, but the old man was surprisingly cool about it. Dave sits there, speechless. Mitch eats wings.Hey, your secretary is sort of hot in like a Dame Judi Dench-playing-a- Nazi kind of way. Is she on the fuck team?What are you gonna tell Jamie?Can I highly recommend against that?Well hello, my precocious daughter!No shit.I'm Mitch. Somehow.. .we switched bodies last night. He's Dave. Jamie looks back and forth between them, expressionless.You see, what happened was, we peed into a magic fountain--But as soon as they find it, we're going to switch back.Are you kidding? Is she kidding? Clearly yes. Jamie heads for the stairs when Dave stops her.Dude, it's March 24th, even I know that.So that I can send you a thoughtful card -- what kind of monster are you?Jamie, please.Mauve.I'm just saying, look at all the accents in this room -- she loves mauve.Dude, you are like the worst husband ever.Okay, look, calm down: I can hold down the fort for one night.Dude, the kids are already going to bed.I think I can handle watching Two And A Half fucking Men and falling asleep on the couch with the best of 'em. The only roadblock I foresee is: what do I tell Jamie?When she wants to have sex tonight.I don't understand. You don't have sex on Tuesdays? A beat. Then Dave starts LAUGHING. It builds. Dave hasn't laughed this hard in a long time. He pats Mitch's cheek.Really?! You want me to bang your wife??Hey dude, I take back everything I said about Two and a Half Men. This is some edgy shit--Nice.I think you should fuck her, that's what I think you should do. Jamie looks over at Mitch, weirded out; he gets up and crosses into the hallway for some privacy.Don't blow this for me, dude, she's my Tuesday night regular.No! Cheating is when any part of your penis touches any part of another woman who is not your wife, and last I checked, your wang is safely tucked away in my incredibly lame triple-pleated sport slacks.Dude, how many women have you fucked in your mind? Thousands?Right, and that's not cheating, right?I think you're on firm legal ground here, amigo. I say jump that ass.Well, it still works the same, but this chick is a lot to handle so pace yourself, okay? She's hornier than a priest at summer camp.You'll do fine. Just wear a condom, okay? Don't give me AIDS-- Just then WHAM -- the door flies open and a very sexy blonde enters the apartment wearing a long trenchcoat and five inch stiletto heels. She moves towards Dave like a panther.Jesus, Dave, it's called a sit-up. Then he sees Jamie's dress land on the bedroom floor, followed by her bra... Mitch exhales:Holy shit, I'm finally going to fuck Jamie. This is my greatest hour! I hope she likes it weird! Then, IN SLOW MOTION, Jamie enters the bathroom, nude, her hair gently blowing in the wind from an open window. She looks insanely hot. Mitch takes her all in, ravenous...Oh my God I am going to ruin her-- And then she sits on the can. And starts taking a dump. Mitch's face drops, horrified.Oh my GOD.Look, I am not attracted to you right now, okay?! So just... No means no, all right? No means no... TIGHT ON Jamie rolling over, confused and genuinely hurt...Mmm?Yeah...I really don't feel like it. Jamie turns on the light, pissed.No, it's 3 in the morning, you go do it. You're the mother.Yes Jamie I'm sorry Jamie!I always thought your wife was a nice lady but she is neither nice nor a lady! She talks like a dock- worker and she shits like one too! Plus I used to think your kids were adorable but actually they're just really fucking annoying and crazy needy-- Wait, are you jacking off?So why are you panting?But isn't that sort of...my penis? Dave looks down.I. .don't know?Yeah. Go lefty, you'll get better torque.It's kind of pro forma now, dude.Yeah, only married dudes still rock dick-fros anymore-- wait: if Tatiana was over earlier, why do you still need to jack off?What did you do?!Oh my God you're so picky!So what, she's having a girl! It wouldn't have been a little boy tickling your tip! Jesus, I can't believe you fucked up my Tuesday night regular!No! You married guys have no idea how hard it is to build a reliable stable! You don't! It's a full time job! Getting girls' phone numbers, calling them, emailing them, Facebooking them, Twittering them, buying them drinks and dinners and coffees and listening to endless stories about their stupid fucking friends and begging them to touch your wiener on the second date and building an elaborate web of lies so they don't all find out about each other -- it's exhausting! And then poof! In one night, you just casually discard my life's work!Sorry doesn't lick my ballbag every Tuesday night...Yeah, your mean wife is making me feed the kids. What do I do?Yes. Obviously.Hold on. Mitch puts the phone in his mouth and picks up the SCREAMING TWINS. Carrying them like bags of wheat, he jogs downAll right. In the kitchen.Yeah?Holy fuck! Mitch yanks Peter away just as SPARKS shoot from the socket!Nothing! Go on! Two bottles...?Oh jesus oh jesus... Mitch approaches her, wide-eyed, tentative -- when Sarah giggles and spastically whips the cleaver at him! He barely sidesteps it, and it impacts into a cupboard door -- F-TWANG!This is so fucked up!Dude. Listen to me: you need to go downtown first thing tomorrow morning and you need to find that fucking fountain... He starts pouring cow's milk into the babies' mouths. It splashes all over them, but they manage to lap up some of it.Honestly, I'm really not sure how much more of this shit I can take.Check it out: I have freckles on my taint! How awesome is that?! They turn to see Mitch in the doorway, buck naked and wet, holding a hand-mirror under his balls. Then he sees Dave.Oh, hey, fag. Why're you here?One to three weeks, maybe more?!What the fuck does that even mean?!What?! No! I can't do this anymore! Your life sucks!Yup! Just two dudes chilling in the bathroom, nothing weird about that!Dude, honestly, I'm working my nuts off over here. I don't know how to play you any better.Oh come on!Umm...? A rabbi, a priest--? BAM! Dave punches Mitch in the nuts.Wait, so I can't sleep with my wife and I can't sleep with other women? What is that?Yeah -- when's your free time?Dry handjob?Okay, can I just say something without you punching my cock? I think you might be taking some of this adult shit a little seriously--HELL-lo legs.Please, come in! Coffee? Scotch?And I'll have my briefs on your chin by tomorrow morning--Oh shit, this is Sabrina?! Sabrina looks at Dave, even more confused.You guys should go out!Yeah! You're single now, Mitch, remember? And Sabrina is stone fucking hot! Look at that body! Sabrina: swimmer in college?You two should go out, have a nice steak dinner, go dancing at some weird Korean nightclub and then fuck on the roof, you know what I mean? How's 8pm tomorrow night, Richter's Steakhouse? Sabrina and Dave stammer, sharing a terrorized look.Great! I know for a fact that Mitch is free, so he'll see you there! And honey: wear something tight, you know what I mean? Make it fun.No dude: you're so fucking laid!I'm sorry, I just got you a date with the number one girl on your Cancer List and this is the thanks I get?Yes you are.Yes you are, because if you don't, I will feed'your children non- organic snacks and then introduce them to my extensive girl-on-horse pornography collection. How do you think Jamie will react to that? Dave just looks at Mitch, horrified.Because I've seen your life and if you don't loosen up soon you are literally going to die. So go out with this chick. Have fun. Bust a nut. Remember why life is beautiful again, okay? Please? This actually gets to Dave a bit. He frowns, fine...Also, see if she likes to fuck on Tuesday nights, because you owe me a regular.Oh! Hey... Mister ...Planko? What are you doing here?Yeah, maybe if you're from Kansas.What's that supposed to mean?I mean, you still have a really fucking cool son, right?!They're fucking fine-- what the fuck does that mean, \"Mitch is definitely cool?!\"But what, dude?! Spit it out!Your son is not a fuck up, M-Mr. Planko! He's just a late bloomer! His dad looks utterly confused as Mitch gets into the car.I'm sorry, I'm just very close to Mitch and when people say mean things about him I hurt too-- He SLAMS the door shut and jerks out of the parking spot, tears pouring down his face. His dad watches on, bewildered.Fuck! Fuck... And then Survivor's \"Eye of the Tiger\" comes on the radio. Mitch's expression slowly turns to steely determination...I need the book CORPORATE LAW FOR DUMMIES, every season of Law & Order on DVD and Blu-Ray, and the biggest fucking coffee you can carry on my desk in 15 minutes or else you're fired. Gladys writes this down on a pad of paper, a bit turned on...Also get yourself a new haircut and a pair of six inch stripper shoes. It's time to take this shit to the next level.Fuck me she's cute...Where'd you learn to ninja-flip a girl like that?Good girl. So what'd we learn from this?That's right, baby. Bones. They bump fists. Jamie is stunned.Violence is cool.I'm kidding!Lockwood.Don't move. I'll be right over.Like a fucking tool. Step aside-- Mitch throws open the closet and yanks out a pair of jeans.These are called jeans. They've been very popular with our nation's young people for over 60 years. Put them on immediately.Shut up and do what I say. We only have 3 hours to make you cool...This is called gel, or product. Use too little and you look like a pedophile Cub Scout leader, use too much and you look Persian. Neither is a winning hand. Dave very nervously applies gel to his hair...Okay, normally I would never do this for another man, but since we're in a rush, and technically this is my testicle bag, I'm making a rare exception. Always man-scape before a first date. It shows a lady that you're clean, considerate, and American.Don't speak, it jiggles your sack.You need to learn to be spontaneous, Dave. Chicks like spontaneous. Hey ladies! Show us your tits! They flip him off. Mitch laughs. Dave is still floored:Do me a favor, Dave. Relax your butt hole.Your sphincter. Just... release it. Dave's entire body visibly relaxes a bit.You didn't even know it was puckered, right? Now recline your seat a bit...Now, just for like three minutes, don't be a dad, don't be a husband, don't be a lawyer, just be a dude rolling down Sunset strip in a fucking Ferrari with his best friend listening to Seal, okay? Dave looks out the window, getting into it...Feels good, right? After a moment, a TEAR escapes from under Dave's shades.It's okay, just let it out.I know, baby. I know. They cruise for a bit longer, then Mitch pulls into a CAR WASH. Dave looks confused.We're not washing the car, David. We're getting you mentally, physically, and spiritually ready for your date. Come on.Now. I don't have time to cover all the ways in which women have changed since you last dated... Mitch stops at the register to pay. Various CAR WASH EMPLOYEES keep saying hi to Dave, weirding him out.The bottom line is: the internet has revolutionized everything.Fuck J-date. No. The internet has changed chicks in three major ways: first, access and acceptance of pornography has commoditized women and pressured them into becoming sluttier at far younger ages, which is awesome. Mitch finishes paying and continues through the car wash.Second: text messaging has de- stigmatized the booty call. Call a girl at 3 in the morning for sex and it's creepy. Text her \"SUCK WANG MIDNIGHT??\" and it's classy. I have no idea why, but again, an awesome development.Third: Facebook and other social networking sites have falsely convinced people -- women included -- that they are funny, interesting, and unique. Get used to listening waaay more than you used to. Chicks are the new dudes, they talk about themselves all the fucking time now. Practice saying things like \"you are so different\" and \"no, really, what Golden Girl would you be?\" and \"I love Lady Gaga too.\"I don't know, it's either a pop singer or an energy drink. They arrive at the CAR WASH WAITING AREA. People sit around, waiting for their cars, many of them young, female, and cute.Okay, let's talk to some honeys, get your flow going again.The girls are alone, bored, and old enough to drive -- it's a goldmine. I run game here four to seven times a week. Now go on, bust a move.Really.Reall v!Okay Daddy Day Care show me how it's done then! Shit! Dave sighs and crosses to a CUTE BLONDE texting nearby. As he draws closer, however, he starts to tense up...soon he's sweating... it's been a long time ...by the time he finally reaches the blonde, his voice is ridiculously shrill:Shake it off. Being single is like the Tour De France: it's all about quick recovery time. Now go on, get your groove back, you're meeting Sabrina in a half hour.Forty seconds. Not bad. Your times are improving.As a general rule, when you're talking to single women, conversation topics to avoid include: your wife, your children, your favorite playgrounds, and The Wiggles... Dave nods, hating himself. Mitch heads for the Ferrari.But this was good. You worked out all your bad game and now you're ready to dominate. Come on.Relax: you're dressed cool, your hair is crushing it, your ballsack is taut and smooth, and you're way better looking than you've ever been. Just remember Uncle Mitch's Golden Rule of Dating.What? No. No, my Golden Rule of Dating is always find the fun. Think of it like this: for the next two hours, you're stuck with this chick. Doesn't matter if she's cool or crazy or if she was born with a vagina on her forehead -- you're stuck, so make the most of it. I dated this chick named Topaz once who may or may not have killed her father. Long story short, she looked like 50 miles of bad road and I wasn't interested, but I used our time together to learn about incest and the failures of the American Appellate Court system. I found it hugely informative, and Topaz got caught up in my enthusiasm and gave me a crying blowjob on the car-ride home, so everybody won. The point is: find the fun for yourself and great things will follow. Dave looks horrified as they roll up to RICHTER'S, a chic steakhouse.Power hug. Mitch hugs a still-speechless Dave...Now go on. Make daddy proud.Really? Open-toed sandals at work?Look, I can't hang right now, okay? I've got the mediation in like ten minutes. Dave stands right back up, surprised and impressed.700 million, you got it.What?! Dave: No. You can't, you have to wait at least a week! Dave reaches for his cellphone as he heads out the door.You sent her flowers after one date?! Are you retarded?! Do not get me into a relationship, dude! Too late. Dave is already gone. Mitch scowls. Then:You can come out now, Gladys... A second later, GLADYS, in a form-fitting suit and a sexy new bob, crawls out from under his desk. Mitch zips up his pants.Look, honey, I don't think this isF-Fine, but can you please stop following me to the bathroom and calling my house late at night and sending me all those filthy emails? It's, you know, deeply disturbing.I've created a monster...14! 14 sandwiches and 9 Diet Slice's! Pay up, cocksucker! An EXEC gives him a 5 dollar bill. Mitch waves it in the air and HUMS the Olympic theme song. Flemming just glares at him like, you're so fired. Then the mediator enters.Fuck that, dude, you can do better.Look, this is just like when you're trying to fuck a Jewish girl and she keeps saying \"no, no, I don't want to, I'm really drunk and you're not circumcised\" but then she keeps making out with you and not getting out of your Fiero so you know she really does want it, she just needs to be nudged a bit more so she can rationalize it to herself and to her God, know what I mean? This is just like that. Everyone in the room is speechless. Mitch opens another soda.Jesus I do not feel good.If this was really their final offer, they'd leave. Instead, they're sticking around, which means they have more money to spend. Ted looks at his execs. It's not a terrible point...Fuck it, homey, go for 100.Enh, can't hurt to ask. You wouldn't believe the nasty shit I get girls to do just by asking. Honestly, it's revolting.Seriously, does anyone have a Pepto? Because I'm gonna throw. Finally, Ted opens the door and says to the mediator:Nice, bro. Way to show some sack.Hey, me too. Bones. He extends his fist. Ted ignores him and gathers his things.Fuck it. Helping ridiculously rich people become even more ridiculously rich is why I go to work every day.I am?! Fuck, I've never really been good at anything before... Mitch considers this a second, then laughs, proud.Gimme me a hug you tiny capitalist! Mitch hugs Ted and lifts him off the ground, spinning him.I love you so much...You hear about the fountain?Sure. Right. I mean... the funny thing is...I was just starting to enjoy your life a little bit...Really?So.. .maybe we should keep going--?I'm so glad I said that too! Your life rocks!I just closed the Amalgamated deal for 825 million dollars and for the first time ever, people actually respect me! It's so weird! Word is they're going to make me partner tonight! I love your life, dude!Dude, you sent her flowers -- she's gonna fuck you like a crack whore on rent day.No! Course not.Is it though...? Mitch bumps fists with smiling co-workers... Dave watches Sabrina CHEER after a base hit...Yeah, we're fucking morons.Take it easy, Mitch...I-I'm sorry...I just... He hurries off towards the bathroom. Everyone looks confused.What am I doing...? This isn't my life...Oh no. Gladys, not now--I thought we talked about not usingLook, Gladys, I love bathroom sex as much as the next guy, but-- She SPITS in his face, crazy-eyed.O-Okay? Well, I guess what's bothering me is...I didn't earn any of this, you know? Gladys rips open his shirt and starts licking his chest downward until she disappears OUT OF FRAME.And I know what you're thinking: Mitch, not earning things never used to bother you, why does it bother you now? And the answer is: maybe I'm growing up. We hear the sound of his pants UNZIPPING...I mean, sure, I closed the deal today, and that felt good, but I didn't put in all the years of hard work that got Dave to this point, you know? Plus, those aren't my adorable kids, that's not my beautiful wife, you're not even my freaky deaky old lady secretary. I want to earn this stuff-- Just then FLEMMING STEEL III BLOWS IN -- and stops cold:Uh oh.Sir, it's not my fault--!Jamie, you gotta believe me, this woman is a predator--!Jamie--! Too late. She runs off, choking back tears...FUCK! Fuck... He stands in the rain, overcome with self-loathing...Oh, angel, it's nothing. I'm just going away for a little while...It's... confusing grown-up stuff--O-Okay? Well. I'm leaving because I'm a fuck up. Do you know what a fuck up is?Right. Right. Well, I thought this time was different, you know? I thought I actually did something right for once. But no, I'm still the same old fuck up I've always been. Only this time I really fucking fucked up, because I fucked up my life and my best friend's life... Mitch zips up his bag, full of regret -- and finds Cara hugging his leg.Thanks, sweetie, but your brain is the size of a radish. I am a fuck up. I always have been, and I always will be. Guys like me, we know how to have fun, but we don't know how to do the important stuff, you know...? Be good, okay, kiddo? She nods, confused. He kisses her head and exits, emotional.Dave?Is that Jamie?So, um, are you guys driving me to the desert to kill me?I was just...trying to be helpful.Wait! Stop! The workmen stop packing the fountain, confused.Yes. We have to pee in it.I can't pee with them watching! PAN OVER to the workmen, standing nearby, looking at Mitch and Dave like they're total freaks.The sun is shining all the time, Looks like another perfect day, I love L.A. We love it! I love L.A...Oh thank god.Do we, though?Just so you know, this isn't gay! Our penises aren't even touching--!How the fuck should I know? Thank you! Have a pleasant evening!Wasn't it?I still can't get used to the whole underwear thing. It's such aHow's my favorite ballerina?!Jesus fucking Christ... Dave sees SABRINA, looking angelic in a sundress, chatting with a circle of GUESTS on the patio.Great. We just celebrated our two week anniversary.You think she's fucking Fernando Valenzuela? We see that the man she's talking to is, in fact, Dodger great FERNANDO VALENZUELA, in a pimped-out white suit.I'm oddly okay with it.I know. She really is perfect-- Just then TATIANA and KIEFER SUTHERLAND approach, wheeling her newborn DAUGHTER in a pram.Thanks, Kiefer. See you guys. Mitch kisses Tatiana on the cheek and they head off.It's creepy that Kiefer Sutherland is like way into other people's babies, right?Thanks again for hooking me up with the job at Amalgamated, man.I think I'm really going to crush it in corporate America.I love you too, Dad. They break apart. Mitch, Sr. heads off. Then he stops.

{"raw_line": "What a day. Dr. Klein lost the twins immunization record, the wireless went down, and Cara got bullied in ballet class again.We need to remind her to keep striving for verbal resolution.And how was your day, monster man? Before Dave can answer, the doorbell rings, DING-DONG! They exchange the weary smile of parents who never see each other.He's early.Oh no, hon, those are super old-- Too late -- Mitch is already eating the very old steak.Thanks... sort of...?Annnd that's probably enough--Our old kindergarten teacher?!Honey, everyone likes Dave better than you.Whenever. Have fun.Always a pleasure, Mitch. Mitch steals THREE PEARS and some TULIPS as he exits...What? What's your problem? Mitch shields his eyes with his hands, shocked and disgusted.What are you talking about? Mitch finally notices he's in DAVE'S BEDROOM...Um, yeah?Are you insane?Are you still drunk?What?Dave is right here! You're Dave! He turns and sees himself in the mirror. Freezes. He is Dave.Hey.You staying for dinner? Silence. Then Mitch nudges Dave.Okay, but make it quick, I've got to put the twins to bed.Great! Sounds like a plan.Okay, Mitch, first of all, don't call me baby, it's creepy. Second of all... what the hell are you talking about?.When's our wedding anniversary? Dave freezes, oh shit.Spring?I really don't have time to--What's my favorite color?Fine, what did we talk about two nights ago...? I was crying...?That's great, Mitch. Thanks a big bunch. Come on, honey. Jamie steams upstairs, pissed, with Cara in tow. Dave runs his hands through his hair, fuck! Mitch looks appalled:I have to cool it on the Thai food. I've had the shits all day.Seriously -- light a candle. She keeps shitting. It sounds like Niagara Falls. Thunderous. Foregoing the candle, Mitch covers his nose with his forearm and stumbles out of the bathroom, nauseous...What is your problem?Your turn.It's your turn to feed the twins.Are you fucking kidding me?Get the fuck out bed right now and go feed your fucking children or I will fucking cut you! Mitch is already scrambling out of the room, terrified.Dave's in the shower.Just tell me honestly...is Dave having an affair?Temporary? We've been in this rough patch for yearsYou don't want to hear about this.It's not his fault, really...I love him with all my heart, you know I do, but-you remember Dave's family growing up. They were a mess. They had nothing. Dave's entire childhood was spent looking over the fence, wanting a better life. So he scrimped and saved and worked four jobs at once and put himself through school and built a better life for himself. I've always loved that about him.No one ever gave him anything. The problem is, now that he's got a good life, he can't turn it off -- he's still looking over the fence, wanting something even better, a second house, more kids, a faster car, a bigger promotion, whatever it is that he thinks will finally make him happy. Dave reddens, defensive; this is hitting very close to home.Um, I'm going to work?You guys okay in there?Okay...? See you later... We hear Jamie's FOOTSTEPS retreat. Dave grows emotional:Uh oh, here comes the second battement glisse... Jamie tenses up. Mitch does too... As Cara starts her spin, Nicolette Peters goes to push her over -- and Cara calmly grabs her arm, FLIPS her over her shoulder, and drops her flat on her back with a loud WHAM! As Nicolette starts CRYING, Cara calmly continues dancing like nothing happened. The other girls on stage look pleased. Mitch CLAPS and WHISTLES:Honey--?.Well, looks like you won't be doing ballet at the rec center anymore.What?! No, angel, that's exactly the wrong lesson. You should never use violence, except to defend yourself, okay? Mitch subtly shakes his head at Cara, don't listen to her.Dave!I'm so proud of you, baby. You worked so hard for this... Mitch winces, knowing just how wrong she is. All around him, the partners stand, APPLAUDING. Mitch stands, a bit dizzy.I thought you might be having an affair... but not with Gladys:You know what? No. I can't do this anymore. I want you out of the house by the time the kids wake up.Dave is cheating on me! Dave quickly covers his hard-on with a pillow.How could you lie to me, Mitch?! We've known each other for--! Then Jamie sees scantily-clad Sabrina and stops.Oh.I'm sorry -- I'm Jamie, the wife of one of Mitch's friends.You know the prick?!Yes, with his secretary, Gladys!No! No more excuses! The next time you see my asshole husband tell him that I will never. Ever. Take him back, you got that?! Dave nods quickly, terrified.Sabrina! It was nice to meet you!Mitch?What is the matter with you?!What are you talking about--?O-Okay?Why...are you calling me pumpkin? And then he kisses her. She resists--Mitch--?. But he holds her firm. And soon she's kissing him back, confused and overwhelmed and crying... It's emotional and intense for him, too. They finally separate, but remain inches apart, breathing hard.Dave? Dave nods. Jamie squints, trying to understand.But...how? Dave shakes his head, I don't know...So...then ...Mitch was the one... with Gladys? Dave nods again. Jamie looks relieved... Then she stops.Wait, so who was that hot young thing back in the apartment?Okay. But-we're going to need to talk about this.Like, a lot. Like, a-therapy-lot.I kind of like kissing Mitch.So ...mmm...so what do we do now?Get in the fucking car, dipshit! Mitch, terrified, sprints to the car and hops in.It suddenly makes a lot more sense why you spent so much time rubbing my breastfeeding cream onto my boobs every night.Oh, and what about that time you--?Your turn.Great, go feed the fucking babies. She rolls over and goes back to sleep. He grins and runs out.It's Tuesday...It's Tuesday morning.", "clean_line": "day dr klein lost twins immunization record wireless went cara got bullied ballet class need remind striving verbal resolution day monster man dave answer doorbell rings ding dong exchange weary smile parents early oh hon super old late mitch eating old steak thanks sort annnd probably old kindergarten teacher honey likes dave better fun pleasure mitch mitch steals pears tulips exits problem mitch shields eyes hands shocked disgusted talking mitch finally notices dave bedroom um yeah insane drunk dave right dave turns sees mirror freezes dave hey staying dinner silence mitch nudges dave okay quick ve got twins bed great sounds like plan okay mitch baby creepy second hell talking wedding anniversary dave freezes oh shit spring time favorite color fine talk nights ago crying great mitch thanks big bunch come honey jamie steams upstairs pissed cara tow dave runs hands hair fuck mitch looks appalled cool thai food ve shits day seriously light candle keeps shitting sounds like niagara falls thunderous foregoing candle mitch covers nose forearm stumbles bathroom nauseous problem turn turn feed twins fucking kidding fuck bed right feed fucking children fucking cut mitch scrambling room terrified dave shower tell honestly dave having affair temporary ve rough patch yearsyou want hear fault love heart know remember dave family growing mess dave entire childhood spent looking fence wanting better life scrimped saved worked jobs school built better life ve loved gave problem got good life turn looking fence wanting better second house kids faster car bigger promotion thinks finally happy dave reddens defensive hitting close home um going work guys okay okay later hear jamie footsteps retreat dave grows emotional uh oh comes second battement glisse jamie tenses mitch cara starts spin nicolette peters goes push cara calmly grabs arm flips shoulder drops flat loud wham nicolette starts crying cara calmly continues dancing like happened girls stage look pleased mitch claps whistles honey looks like won ballet rec center anymore angel exactly wrong lesson use violence defend okay mitch subtly shakes head cara listen dave proud baby worked hard mitch winces knowing wrong partners stand applauding mitch stands bit dizzy thought having affair gladys know anymore want house time kids wake dave cheating dave quickly covers hard pillow lie mitch ve known jamie sees scantily clad sabrina stops oh sorry jamie wife mitch friends know prick yes secretary gladys excuses time asshole husband tell got dave nods quickly terrified sabrina nice meet mitch matter talking okay calling pumpkin kisses resists mitch holds firm soon kissing confused overwhelmed crying emotional intense finally separate remain inches apart breathing hard dave dave nods jamie squints trying understand dave shakes head know mitch gladys dave nods jamie looks relieved stops wait hot young thing apartment okay going need talk like lot like therapy lot kind like kissing mitch mmm fucking car dipshit mitch terrified sprints car hops suddenly makes lot sense spent time rubbing breastfeeding cream boobs night oh time turn great feed fucking babies rolls goes sleep grins runs tuesday tuesday morning"}, "SABRINA": {"raw_line": "Yes...um...sort of big news.No... thanks?
